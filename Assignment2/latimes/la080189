NEWSMAKERS: LAWMAKER GETTING CLOSE LOOK AT HOW THE LAW WORKS

Michigan Rep. Dennis Dutko hasn't been in his office since May 24, but twice a 
day the state lawmaker checks in with his Capitol staff by telephone. And 
residents of his suburban Detroit district understand the problem. The 
eight-term Democrat is an inmate at the Ingham County Jail in Warren, where he 
is serving a one-year sentence for his third drunken driving conviction. 
"Because he doesn't have a vote, to tell you that he does have an impact on the 
House would be to distort the situation," said Paul Mendelsohn, Dutko's aide. 
Dutko, 45, has been removed as chairman of two House committees, although he's 
not required to resign, since he was convicted on a misdemeanor. Still, the 
Michigan chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and a group of Dutko's 
constituents have initiated a recall drive, which, according to Michael 
Raveane, editor of the Warren Weekly, has drawn little interest. "It's 
something that people have been reading about, but it's not something they are 
upset about," Raveane said.

 -- Allen H. Neuharth, founder of USA Today, is unlikely to find the skies 
friendly the next time he boards an airliner. In a column last week, the 
recently retired chairman of Gannett Co. Inc. wrote: "Many of the young, 
attractive, enthusiastic female flight attendants -- then called stewardesses 
-- have been replaced by aging women who are tired of their jobs or by flighty 
young men who have trouble balancing a cup of coffee." He said that if he were 
running an airline, he would insist on old-fashioned statistics -- namely, 
shapely "sky girls" should be under age 25, 5 feet, 4 inches tall or less, and 
weigh less than 115 pounds. Neuharth has triggered a firestorm not only from 
the Assn. of Flight Attendants but also from more than 175 of the paper's 425 
newsroom employees, who signed a letter, published in the paper, that said they 
were "offended, outraged and embarrassed" by the column.

 -- Irish flutist James Galway won't soon forget his recent trip to Lucerne, 
Switzerland. Galway's five gold-plated, diamond-studded flutes were put on a 
baggage cart at the train station and then quickly disappeared. "We turned away 
for a minute and the cart was gone," said his wife, Jeanne, who also is a 
concert flutist. "The flutes were specially made and are numbered . . . . 
They're each worth 30,000 pounds ($49,200), and we will be offering a reward."

AL MARTINEZ: OUT ON THE EDGE

"Where will I go? What will I do?" 
</P>
<P>
The questions, asked in anguish, hang in the sultry air of Liz McVey's tiny 
upstairs apartment on a Hollywood side street. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the owner of a produce truck blasts a horn to announce his presence in 
the predominantly Latino neighborhood. Voices rise through an open window, like 
snatches of sound from a distant world. 
</P>
<P>
McVey is motionless, trapped inside her own thoughts, a tremulous half-smile 
frozen on her face. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, she seems unreal, as though transformed suddenly into glazed 
pottery. 
</P>
<P>
Then, abruptly, without preamble, she speaks again. "I owe three months' rent, 
I'm almost out of medicine, and I will be evicted next week. I have no money 
and no income." 
</P>
<P>
She sits on the edge of a daybed, prongs from an oxygen tube inserted into each 
nostril. There is a wheelchair and aluminum walker nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"How could this happen?" 
</P>
<P>
McVey is 49 but, in this moment of despair, appears older. Her skin is pale and 
her reddish-gray hair disheveled. It's hard to imagine her as successful. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to wonder why homeless people couldn't just pull themselves up by the 
bootstraps," she says. "I guess I'll find out." 
</P>
<P>
She hesitates, fidgeting with the oxygen tube that winds like a silver snake 
across the floor to a tank in another room. Then the realization comes to her, 
stark and mean, the truth she has not wanted to face. 
</P>
<P>
Liz McVey -- private investigator, restaurateur, once the privileged daughter 
of a wealthy landowner -- is about to become homeless, and she's terrified. 
</P>
<P>
How, indeed, could it happen? Is it possible that any one of us, burdened by 
successive calamities, could end up suddenly on the edge, about to drop from a 
world of the familiar into an existence as alien as life on another planet? 
</P>
<P>
It's happening to Liz McVey. 
</P>
<P>
Within less than a year, her health has deteriorated and her income has gone 
from $10,000 a month to zero. 
</P>
<P>
A born-again Christian, she clings to her faith like a climber to a rope, but 
the rope unravels as hope thins. Her friends have given all they can, and she 
has one week before eviction. 
</P>
<P>
There are no miracles on Hollywood side streets. 
</P>
<P>
McVey was raised in a gray stone mansion in a wealthy section of Chester, Pa., 
and numbered the DuPonts among her schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Bryn Mawr, she came to California in the mid-1950s as an Air 
Force comptroller, then, intrigued by detective work, earned a private 
investigator's license. By 1970, she owned two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the success of her agencies that within 10 years she had opened a pair 
of restaurants. One, a soul food cafe, became a hangout for black celebrities 
and was grossing almost a million dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Then the roof fell in. Cheated by her own employees, cleaned out by thieves, 
both restaurants went under. McVey ended up losing an elaborate Westside home 
and owing $100,000. She declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
But through it all, she kept the detective agencies and worked hard to 
reestablish her life. Two years ago, she won a large contract for undercover 
work, but what seemed like a way back was only a prelude to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
If it is true we are all fate's children, Liz McVey was selected for a 
punishment beyond reason. 
</P>
<P>
Moved into her current apartment as she rebuilt her life, she fell through a 
back porch, injuring her knees, her hip and her back. Unwilling to sue, she 
suffered the pain and went on with her career, but fell again, this time off a 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was seven months in a hospital, an attack of asthma she says was 
caused by medication, pneumonia and a diagnosis of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
She has been bedridden since October. Doctors feel it will be at least three 
months before she is able to work again. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her savings have disappeared, she is three months behind in her 
rent, and grief is at the door. 
</P>
<P>
She is seeking other government assistance but has been told it will take at 
least four months, if it is forthcoming at all. 
</P>
<P>
Friends have been bringing her food and some have paid her telephone bill, but 
generosity is tempered by priority. Liz McVey is not first on their list. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I'm where I am," she says, the fingertips of one hand touching 
her cheek in a gesture of incredulity. "It doesn't seem that long since 
October." 
</P>
<P>
She shakes her head and asks the questions again, another of fate's children on 
the precipitous brink of despair. 
</P>
<P>
"What will I do?" she says. "Where will I go?"

U.S. STRATEGY FOR NUCLEAR RESPONSE

<TEXT>
<P>
I want to thank Toth for his chilling three-part series. Coupled with the 
(Northrop) ad on Page 7 for the stealth bomber, it made quite an impression on 
me. I am in disbelief. I really believed that the era of the Evil Empire of the 
Soviet Union was over. Obviously, I have been in a dream world. The scenes of 
President Reagan and President Gorbachev signing the nuclear missile reduction 
agreement, the words of President Bush about moving toward de-escalation of 
tension are vivid but apparently illusory. 
</P>
<P>
We must as citizens of this planet speak out. The leadership of this country 
needs desperately to hear from us. Please write or phone your representatives 
and let them know how you feel about the $305-billion defense budget.

A few items of interest from Part I of Sunday morning's (July 23) paper: 
</P>
<P>
1. Tony Aliengena completes his Friendship Flight. His father praised the 
"tremendous reception" the group received in the Soviet Union and George Bush 
wants a copy of the Friendship Scroll signed by thousands of children during 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
2. Thousands of U.S. sailors and American citizens board three Soviet warships 
at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia to "exchange gifts, smiles and handshakes" 
and "foster good will." 
</P>
<P>
3. The Bush Administration is quietly revising the U.S. strategy for fighting a 
nuclear war to include the "creation of new weapons so devastating they could 
penetrate the deepest underground bunkers and 'decapitate' the entire Soviet 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, guys. I'm going back to bed.

U.S. STRATEGY FOR NUCLEAR RESPONSE

Since when does the U.S. Government release its newest SIOPs? This article, and 
the accompanying one on "L.A. Area Targets," is nothing more than a cynically 
calculated piece of propaganda aimed at eliciting a harsh response from the 
Russians (we will sound-mine and overfly their territory with impunity), 
increasing war fear among Americans, leading us to accept the nonsense of the 
B-2, still another stealth plane, burrowing N-bombs, and who knows what else. 
</P>
<P>
Our military-industrial complex (President Eisenhower's words) is terrified 
that we will recognize that piloted penetration bombers are irrelevant in a 
ballistic missile nuclear warfare scenario; that its major contractors may have 
to learn to live in the civilian economy: that peace may break out. To avoid 
this, it is willing to undermine the delicate web of perestroika at the expense 
of world peace, and especially of the American taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Enough! Let's start by canceling the B-2, for which there is still no mission 
that can't be handled better and cheaper by missiles, cruise or ballistic.

Words cannot begin to express my feelings upon reading your account of the Bush

Words like shock, anger, fear, outrage, sadness and laughter. They can't be

Toth left out the greatest threat our country faces: if (Soviet President 
Mikhail S.) Gorbachev prevails and gets his military to accept a unilateral end 
to the arms race, how will our economy survive? It can be done, but would 
require even greater planning than merely drawing up a new nuclear strategy.

IN FORM AND FUNCTION, MIDEAST TERRORISM IS -- OR SHOULD BE -- PREDICTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is director of European studies at the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He was on the 
National Security Council staff during the Carter Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Middle East terrorism has reached out across 8,000 miles to shock 
and horrify the American people. Once again, we discover that there is precious 
little that can be done militarily without doing more damage to U.S. interests 
than to the terrorists. And once again we are tempted to ignore a critical 
lesson: that more bloodshed will ensue as long as the region's politics resist 
basic change. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, longstanding patterns of behavior in the Middle East have 
reasserted themselves, like some earthly version of celestial mechanics, with 
each entity moving in assigned and predictable ways. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that it can be dated, the current crisis began earlier this year 
when the new Bush Administration indicated that it was serious about 
Arab-Israeli peacemaking, in contrast to its predecessor, which, at its best, 
was lukewarm. But every effort to move toward peace also stimulates those who 
prefer the status quo, because they either profit from turmoil or fear the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, as the United States sought to help politics "ripen" in both Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization, it had to steel its nerves against acts 
of terrorism, laid to Palestinians, that seemed designed to discredit the 
new-found diplomacy of the PLO's chairman, Yasser Arafat. Israel's coalition 
government had to resist assault from the right over Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir's proposal for elections in the occupied territories. His leadership was 
further threatened by charges that, in talking with Palestinians, he was 
somehow negotiating with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
As much as anything else, Israel's kidnaping last week of Hezbollah leader 
Sheik Abdel Kareem Obeid, presumably to try swapping him for three Israeli 
soldiers held captive in Lebanon, was a product of this political logic -- a 
bow by Shamir to his right so that he could continue moving to his left. The 
response by a group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed of the 
Earth was equally in the character of the Middle East: to apply pressure on 
Israel by striking at the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the figure portrayed in the grisly videotape was Lt. Col. 
William R. Higgins, and whether or not he was murdered this week or months ago, 
the United States is again faced with the unique dilemmas of terrorism, 
compounded in this case by threats to other Americans held captive in Lebanon. 
Uncertainty surrounds the identity of the group carrying out the execution and 
even its precise motives: Did it act simply to secure Obeid's release? Or did 
it also want to drive a wedge between the United States and Israel, or to 
discredit the fledgling peace process? Or perhaps this was at least partly an 
effort to deter Western nations from developing better relations with Iran 
under President Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose election last Friday coincided with 
the Israeli raid. 
</P>
<P>
There is no clear way to apply the massive military power of the United States 
-- thus the renewal of national frustration that terrorism so often produced 
during the Carter and Reagan years. There will be debate about the wisdom and 
the efficacy of dealing with the terrorists -- "caving in." And there will be 
dispute about whether Israel should be asked to let Obeid go, as the United 
States pressed it to release 766 Shiite prisoners in 1985 to secure the release 
of Americans held captive on hijacked TWA flight 847. 
</P>
<P>
The classical mechanics of a Middle East crisis took a further turn when 
President Bush cut short a two-day trip to return to Washington, convened the 
National Security Council and set lights burning late at night. As he 
demonstrated in dealing with Panama earlier this year, there can be virtue in 
saying much as part of doing little when little is all that can be done. But 
the Middle East imposes its special logic, and Bush seems to be ignoring a 
cardinal lesson of the Iranian hostage crisis: Dramatizing presidential 
involvement raises the stakes, it provides added opportunities for terrorists 
to manipulate American public opinion, and it magnifies any failure to find 
actions that are both effective and prudent. 
</P>
<P>
In the days ahead, each figure in the apparatus of Middle East politics will 
make his moves, and then this episode, too, shall pass. But it will surely not 
be the last, repeating itself perhaps in another guise, with yet more human 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
During recent years, U.S. debate has turned on whether there is urgency in 
prosecuting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Until Egypt took itself out 
of the military equation, the answer was clearly "yes." But during the years 
since then, the risks of U.S. diplomatic reticence have been far less clear. 
What is happening now in the region should end the argument: For the United 
States, there will be no peace of mind until there is peace in the Middle East.

STILL SHORTCHANGED ON THE SECOND SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman is a syndicated columnist in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the early 1970s, a radical notion arose that husbands should share the 
work at home. This idea, which set men hyperventilating all over America, was 
followed by the plague of lists. 
</P>
<P>
"Up against the refrigerator door!" Mister. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, he would 
cook. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, she would do the laundry. He would wash, she 
would dry; he would drive the kids to school, she would pick them up; they 
would live equally ever after. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began power struggles over the vacuum, wrangles over the dryer, the 
diapers and the children in them. She would insist, he would resist. Actively 
or passively. Progress was often followed by slippage. And articles about 
sharing housework were followed by articles about "The Women's Lib Divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, how quaint it all seems now. So petty. Can you believe that we once argued 
over something so minor in the great scheme of the universe as changing the 
sheets, dear? That love was limited by the list? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the late 1980s. The lists have come down. So has the heat. There is 
an uneasy truce or maybe simmering hostility in two-worker households. 
</P>
<P>
He is doing more than his father and feeling under-appreciated. She is doing 
more than her husband and feeling undervalued. There is a friction between 
women whose lives have changed faster than the men they share them with. There 
is a stalemate over the household. 
</P>
<P>
Now Arlie Hochschild, a Berkeley professor, has written a book on the subject 
that puts work at home back where it belongs: in the context of marital 
relationships. "The Second Shift," her study of two-career parents over eight 
years, describes what goes on in the hours before and after our "real jobs." 
</P>
<P>
She begins with what we know. The wage gap in the outside world is mirrored by 
a leisure gap at home. Women are "working" on average one month a year more 
than their husbands. About 20% of men in her study shared the second shift 
equally, 70% did more than a third and less than a half, and only 10% did less 
than a third. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the most egalitarian households, Hochschild suggests, women did 
two-thirds of the daily jobs -- cooking -- while men did jobs without the same 
deadline -- bills, repairs. When men shared, they were more likely to take over 
child care, leaving women with the same amount of housecare, a job they found 
much less satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Through her intimate portraits of families, we get to dissect the emotional 
meaning of the work disparity. "When couples struggle," she says, "it is seldom 
simply over who does what. Far more often it is over the giving and receiving 
of gratitude." What happens to gratitude when a wife wants help at home and a 
husband "gives her" the paycheck that comes from more time at the office. 
Neither gets what he or she wants. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the many small, telling observations of this book, Hochschild notes: 
"In my interviews, a surprising number of women spoke of their fathers helping 
their mothers 'out of love' or consideration . . . . But not one man . . . made 
this link between help at home and love." 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, she says that "more couples wanted to share and imagined that they 
did." But the quest to keep reality in line with ideals sometimes stretched 
that imagination mightily. One of the couples devised an equal "division of 
labor" this way: He took care of the dog and garage; she took care of the child 
and house. They called it a deal. 
</P>
<P>
In the basic deal of the '80s, most women whose husbands are not sharing have 
giving up trying to change the division of labor. They have their own 
strategies for working the second shift, "They were either super-moming, 
cutting back their hours at work or cutting back at home." 
</P>
<P>
They stopped pushing their husbands to change, Hochschild believes, because 
"getting help at home was second on their wish list after 'want fewer tensions 
at home.' " This fear of divorce quieted many women's demands. But at the same 
time, women whose husbands didn't share thought about divorce more often, and 
women who did divorce listed "neglect of home and child" as their chief 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
I have always assumed that the argument about who works the second shift was 
less about labor relations than about personal relations. Not surprisingly, 
those men who "win" the argument about housework, whose wives work that extra 
month, lose a good deal to exhaustion and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line of Hochschild's study is, after all, that difficult-to-quantify 
thing called happiness. What one thing did contribute to marital happiness? She 
reports unequivocally: "the husband's willingness to do the work at home." Put 
that on the refrigerator door. Right where they used to post the lists.

EASY ROAD FOR GOVERNMENT MISDEEDS; 
</P>
<P>
WHY DO WE DO A ROTTEN JOB OF POLICING THE PUBLIC SECTOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER D. STONE, Christopher D. Stone teaches corporations law at USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is too early to speculate whether "error in judgment" will prove too 
charitable a label to paste over the scandal now playing at Los Angeles' City 
Hall. But while we are waiting for the verdict, let's ask why, when it comes to 
enforcement of law, standards of decency and plain good sense, we do such a 
rotten job policing our public sector? 
</P>
<P>
This may sound strange coming from someone who has long urged tightening up the 
laws we wield against business corporations. But in choosing a legal 
environment in which to play, the corporate polluter and the inside trader 
would pick the public bureaucrat's ballpark any day. The bucks may be bigger in 
the private sector, but the law is cushier in the public. 
</P>
<P>
The indications of this dual standard are pervasive. The management of any 
major business corporation has a team of independent accountants poking around 
under foot. We know that they can be fooled and even co-opted. But no 
private-sector auditor ever missed a mess of the magnitude unraveling at the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Could a business corporation get 
away with telling its shareholders their losses in the obscure dribs and drabs 
we taxpayers are getting about our expected liabilities from the 
savings-and-loans muddle? 
</P>
<P>
When governments legislate worker safety and health rules, they commonly exempt 
themselves. Ditto with selected environmental, labor-relations and securities 
law provisions. Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, municipalities and 
other units of government can be sued only with the government's consent and 
subject to the limits that the government imposes. As individuals, government 
officials are barricaded behind a wall of legal doctrines that those in the 
board room can only envy. 
</P>
<P>
When it is all put together, the public- sector employee or the tenant of a 
public- housing project has fewer legal protections than his neighbor whose 
employer or landlord is a private firm. The Environmental Protection Agency has 
had a far harder time bringing city governments to heel than it has business 
corporations. Politically and in the courts, it is easier to beat up on the 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
There are several explanations why this imbalance persists. Many people assume 
both that the private sector overshadows the rest of the society, and that 
there is less to fear from the generally well-intentioned public sector than 
from their greedy corporate counterparts. Wrong on both counts. Statistically, 
governments (and nonprofit corporations) are growing faster than the for-profit 
corporations -- as employers, consumers and wealth distributors. And government 
has done things in the name of science, national defense and the public 
interest that the greediest corporation would shrink from. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s and '4Os, the U.S. Public Health Service studied the "natural" 
course of syphilis in 400 poor black males, even after penicillin had become 
available and might have cured them. But curing them would have ruined the 
study. And 107 of the "subjects" proceeded to die from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the Army allegedly exposed soldiers to nuclear-weapons tests in 
order to determine how humans would function "in the shadow of a . . . nuclear 
cloud." Veterans trying to prove that leukemia was the price they paid for the 
military's curiosity have been barred a hearing on the charges: the federal 
Torts Claims Act does not permit veterans to bring suit for injuries suffered 
in uniform against the government they fought for. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, it was disclosed that for decades our nuclear-weapons plants 
have been disposing of nuclear and chemical wastes with methods that the 
private sector was told were criminal. When asked why the dumpings were so long 
kept secret, the Department of Energy intoned "national security." 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion is that corporate executives, leery of their own motivations, 
may be more prudent with risks than their public-sector counterparts, who can 
quiet their consciences with glib rationalizations about "public necessity." 
</P>
<P>
There is something else to consider. The people who run major business 
corporations are not only under the gaze of myriad federal and state 
regulators, so that their financial dealings, for example, are subject to 
continuous disclosure. The whole system enjoys supplemental policing by 
shareholders and, more realistically, a bar of "shareholders' attorneys" that 
earns its livelihood raking over the corporate filings and jumping into 
situations that look fishy. 
</P>
<P>
When we turn to the public sector, what takes the place of the shareholders' 
bar? The theoretical retort is that we don't need extra legal accountability 
because we get our accountability at the ballot box. But that is just theory. 
By the time the HUD and S&amp;L fiascoes broke, our national CEO had served out 
his time in Washington and was back on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
There is no one cure for the many facets of public sector mischief. But there 
is a clear starting point. We have to reexamine the dual standard point by 
point. In what ways are the laws and procedures more permissive in the public 
sector, and with what justification? 
</P>
<P>
Such a quest would turn up many control techniques commonly accepted in the 
private sector that merit copying and applying to governments. But without some 
pushing from the public, it is an idea that will move with all the vigor of a 
self-investigation at City Hall.

John Cougar Mellencamp has had it. The artist says he needs a break from rock 
'n' roll and will not tour to promote his recently released album, "Big Daddy." 
"I need to get out of this business for a while," he said. "I've been beating 
my head against the wall since I was 23. I've got no family, no self-respect -- 
I've put everything into the rock 'n' roll business. And I don't think they're 
going to give me a crown for it in heaven, either." DANIEL CERONE

Comedian Rodney Dangerfield will get no respect from the musicians' union in 
Las Vegas. Dangerfield opens at Bally's tonight, despite a strike by musicians 
who are angry that many Vegas showrooms rely on taped music rather than on live 
performers. Connie Francis will also go ahead with her scheduled six-day stand 
at Bally's. The hotel-casino is trying to find a non-union band to replace the 
strikers. The union went on strike last week, prompting singer Dean Martin to 
cancel his engagement in the Celebrity Room. DANIEL CERONE

Two disgruntled employees are getting back at "The Boss." A New Jersey Superior 
Court judge told Bruce Springsteen's attorneys to comply with an earlier court 
order and turn over all of the rock star's income tax records to the attorneys 
of two former "roadies." Michael Batlan and Douglas Sutphin are suing 
Springsteen, saying he owes them thousands of dollars in overtime from the 
"Born in the U.S.A." tour in 1984 and 1985. Each made about $50,000 a year 
working for Springsteen. DANIEL CERONE

A controversial advertisement that was being used to lure film makers to 
Washington State by proclaiming that "Debbie Could Have Done Dallas in Seattle" 
has been withdrawn because of objections from Seattle Police Chief Patrick 
Fitzsimons. "It was absolutely unnecessary to use a pornographic reference to 
lure business," Fitzsimons said of the ad, which was placed in American 
Cinematographer magazine by the state Film and Video Office. "That particular 
film ("Debbie Does Dallas") is very demeaning to women. It's decadent." Film 
bureau head Christine Lewis agreed to pull the quarter-page ad -- at a cost of 
$600 to taxpayers. "I'm sorry I ran it," she said. "We made an error of 
judgment and it won't run again. DANIEL CERONE

MARGY NEWMAN DIES; CREATOR OF PLAYHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Margy Newman, who formed and guided the Westwood Playhouse into the significant 
theatrical showcase it has become, died over the weekend of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Arnold, said she was 68 and died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Newman, with producer Leonard Blair, (and later on her own) took over the 
500-seat theater in what once was the Masonic Club of UCLA on Le Conte Avenue 
in 1974. In June, 1975, the playhouse opened with "The Little Foxes" starring 
Burgess Meredith, Carroll O'Connor and Lee Grant to greater acclaim for the 
theater's sight lines and acoustics than for the performance itself. 
</P>
<P>
It had been a labor of love for Mrs. Newman, who was first attracted to things 
theatrical when she was a student out of Canton, Ohio, and attending the Mme. 
Daykarhanova School for Stage in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
She had married young and subordinated her aspirations to those of her first 
husband, an actor. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when three of her four children (including former "Saturday Night 
Live" comedian Laraine Newman) became involved with the Groundlings, a comedy 
improvisation group in Los Angeles, she helped them look for an appropriate 
theater. By the time she came across the playhouse, the Groundlings had already 
found a home and she became interested in taking on the Westwood herself. 
</P>
<P>
On the strength of her credit and business acumen (Mrs. Newman was also a 
successful home and kitchen designer), the financial arrangements were 
approved, and her wish to bring theater to the Westside was realized. 
</P>
<P>
In the three years that Mrs. Newman helped guide the theater, it offered such 
local premieres as "When You Coming Back Red Ryder?" by Mark Medoff and "P.S. 
Your Cat Is Dead" by the late James Kirkwood. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mrs. Newman and her husband, a Los Angeles businessman, found themselves 
investing heavily just to keep the Playhouse alive. But, despite some artistic 
successes, Mrs. Newman opted not to renew her lease. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Playhouse itself continues as one of the more successful mid-size 
theaters in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her husband and daughter, Laraine, she is survived by another daughter, 
Tracy Dean, two sons, Steven and Paul, and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial services is scheduled Monday at 8 p.m. at the Coronet Theater, 466 
N. La Cienega Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to the Plato Society of 
UCLA's general fund, 1083 Gayley Ave., Los Angeles 90024. Checks should be made 
out to the Regents of the University of California.

MARINERS DEEP-SIX ANGELS IN 8TH; 
</P>
<P>
SEATTLE GETS TO BULLPEN FOR ALL ITS RUNS IN ONE INNING OF 6-5 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels brought their home run show into the Kingdome Monday night, and 
after five innings in this facility, where the ball flies as if it had wings, 
they had added three more homers to their major league-leading total. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels weren't the only team in this version of home run derby, however, 
and the Mariners proved they pack a little punch, too. Seattle scored six times 
in the eighth inning and pulled out a 6-5 victory in front of 19,494. 
</P>
<P>
The loss cut the Angels' lead in the American League West to a half-game as the 
Oakland Athletics beat the Chicago White Sox, 3-2, on Tony Phillips' two-run 
homer in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Mike Witt yielded his sixth hit of the game -- a leadoff single 
to Alvin Davis -- in the eighth and then watched as the Angels' top two 
relievers were slapped around the Kingdome. Nine Mariners came to the plate in 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Minton was the first to provide no relief, giving up a walk, a single, a 
two-run single to Mike Kingery and a two-run double to pinch-hitter Dave 
Cochrane -- who came about a foot shy of a game-tying home run when his drive 
to right-center hit near the top of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader summoned Bryan Harvey, who surrendered the 
game-winning, two-run homer to deep left field by pinch-hitter Jim Presley. 
</P>
<P>
"He got behind me 3-and-1," Presley said, "and I was looking for that fastball. 
It was good for the team and the fans. I don't normally take curtain calls, but 
this was really good for the fans." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey watched Presley tip his hat to the crowd and then gave up another single 
before Bob McClure came in and got Greg Briley to line into an inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike got stiff and we handed it over to the people who usually do the job," 
Rader said. "They just didn't get it done tonight. It happens. 
</P>
<P>
"But you have to give the Mariners credit. They've got a very young ballclub 
that's not easily discouraged, and that makes them dangerous. There's a lot to 
be said for youthful exuberance, and in this park it doesn't take a whole lot 
to get something rolling." 
</P>
<P>
And, for Mariner starter Scott Bankhead, it didn't take a whole lot to get him 
reeling. Bankhead turned 26 Monday, but the right-hander didn't have much 
reason to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead has become quite accustomed to very unhappy birthdays. He is 0-3 with 
a 9.82 earned-run average on his birthday, having surrendered 16 earned runs 
and eight homers in 14 2/3 innings of his three birthday starts. 
</P>
<P>
And this one looked as if it were going to be a cakewalk for the Angels, who 
increased their home run total to 101 on shots by Lance Parrish, Wally Joyner 
and Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Bankhead (10-4) gave up more than one home run in a game was the 
last time he lost a game -- May 17 against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel batters were zeroed in and playing long ball from the outset Monday 
night. In the second inning, Davis ripped a two-out double that one-hopped the 
wall in left-center, and Parrish followed with a rocket into the seats above 
the 23-foot-high wall in right. 
</P>
<P>
They boosted the advantage to 5-0 in the fourth with just three swings. Devon 
White led off with a line-drive single to right and Joyner belted a 400-foot 
homer to right-center. It boosted Joyner's RBI total in July to 25. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Davis slugged one out in right. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, who struck out seven to tie his season high in strikeouts, appeared to be 
the benefactor of the latest Angel homer binge. 
</P>
<P>
He was 1-1 with three no-decisions in his last five outings and wasn't 
overpowering on this night. As usual, he found himself working behind in the 
count often, but he shuffled and danced his way out of one tough situation 
after another. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners had runners on first and third in the first inning, but Witt 
struck out Scott Bradley to end the threat. They had another first-and-third 
opportunity in the fifth, but Witt struck out Harold Reynolds and got Briley on 
a warning-track fly ball to left. They loaded the bases on three singles in the 
sixth, but Witt fanned Edgar Martinez to get out of that jam. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, who is moving in on Frank Tanana for the No. 2 spot on the Angels' 
all-time strikeout list, had been making very slow progress in that department 
this season, striking out three or fewer 12 times in 22 starts. 
</P>
<P>
And that may have been the reason Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre asked home plate 
umpire Derryl Cousins to take a look at Witt's cap. Cousins gave it a thorough 
once-over and handed it back to Witt with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
But no one was thinking about Witt a little later when the Mariners' crashed 
the fences -- and the Angels' party. 
</P>
<P>
But Lefebvre was still talking about the Angels' chances for a Western Division 
title afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a one-game playoff to me," he said. "I think Oakland and 
California are pretty evenly matched. I think it'll go down to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
If it does, the Angels are hoping their bullpen aces are a bit sharper for that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said before Monday night's game that he wanted to settle 
"once and for all" the question of the extent of Brian Downing's rib-cage 
injury. "He's had it for a year and a half and it's something that is going to 
give him a degree of discomfort," Rader said. "But he realizes that everything 
that can be done has been done and he's going to deal with it. Now, can we just 
drop it?" The question arose again during Downing's first at-bat Monday night, 
however, when his knees buckled and he dropped to the ground, wincing in pain 
twice after swinging and fouling off pitches. . . . Chuck Finley and Mike Witt, 
who are scheduled to pitch Friday and Saturday against the Milwaukee Brewers, 
will leave the team and fly to Milwaukee early Thursday. The rest of the team 
will leave after Thursday night's game in Seattle and should arrive in 
Milwaukee "about 6 a.m., if we're very, very lucky," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunne (1-5), who was scheduled to start Wednesday night, will pitch 
tonight for Seattle against Angel rookie Jim Abbott. Seattle Manager Jim 
Lefebvre hasn't decided who will start Wednesday night. . . . How important is 
stability? The Mariners placed right-hander Gene Harris, who has a pulled 
muscle in his rib cage, on the 15-day disabled list Monday and recalled Tom 
Niedenfuer from triple-A Calgary. It was the Mariners' 66th player transaction 
this season. The Angels have made just 15 personnel moves this year. Seattle 
has had so many new players come in, they have a media guide "supplement" with 
biographies of seven players who weren't with the team on opening day.

It is sunny and Sunday, hot and humid, as Roger Clemens emerges from the Boston 
Red Sox dugout and slowly makes his way toward the bullpen. He is followed by 
low murmur, high indifference, sparse applause. Absent is the simmering 
anticipation, the excitement, the human electricity that a Clemens start used 
to generate. There isn't even a group of half-lit, sun-baked crazies poised to 
slap homemade Ks up on the bleacher wall. But at least there is no booing.

When the Red Sox's two-time Cy Young recipient was introduced on Opening Day in 
April, he was treated to an a cappella chorus of vilification the depths of 
which are usually reserved for someone wearing New York Yankee pinstripes. In 
an off-season television interview, Clemens made comments that were interpreted 
to be critical of the city of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Noses got out of joint, ire was raised. And no one can dish it out quite like 
the Boston faithful with a sense of mission. "They boo," the dearly departed 
Bruce Hurst says comparing other fans, "but they don't pass out doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Just three short seasons ago, Roger Clemens was the toast of Beantown. He set 
down 20 batters on strikes in one game, pitched the Red Sox into the World 
Series (24-4, 2.48 ERA, 238 strikeouts), was named American League and All-Star 
Game most valuable player and won the Cy Young Award. The following year he 
earned a second All-Star berth and another Cy Young (20-9, 2.97 ERA, 256 
strikeouts). 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Clemens was 15-5 (2.24 ERA) heading into August, cruising, it 
seemed, toward his third 20-victory season and yet another Cy for the mantle. 
</P>
<P>
And then mortality set in. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens went 0 for August (five losses, 7.33 ERA), finishing the season at 
18-12, with a 4.82 ERA in his final 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
There was talk of injury, that his vaunted 95-plus-m.p.h fastball was lacking. 
</P>
<P>
Some said his season changed after a late July game in Texas in which he threw 
161 pitches in 101-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
There was mention of a lower-back injury he sustained at home when he had to 
twist and throw a rug he was lifting to avoid dropping it on his infant son. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Clemens said he had "severe tendinitis" in his right shoulder 
that was related to the back injury. 
</P>
<P>
But Red Sox physician Arthur Pappas said the shoulder was just sore and that 
the real problem was a muscle pull in the rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone did agree that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys were saying he wasn't throwing as hard," says Red Sox second baseman 
Marty Barrett. "When they got to second base, they would say he was just 
throwing 90, as opposed to his usual 95." 
</P>
<P>
But the pitch that earned Clemens such harsh treatment at the throats of the 
home folk came in an early December TV interview from his winter home in Texas. 
Said Clemens in part: " . . . There are some things going on there in Boston 
making it a little bit tough as far as your family. . . . There's too many 
obstacles there in Boston to be able to overcome. . . . There are a lot of 
things that are a disadvantage for a family there. I'm not going to specify it 
right here, but I know that a lot of the Red Sox people know about it, and I 
know everybody on our team knows about it." 
</P>
<P>
After the initial tabloid-led uproar, Clemens tried to clarify his remarks, 
claiming he had been talking about the Red Sox organization when he used the 
word "Boston." He insisted he was referring to the facilities for players' 
families at Fenway Park, the lack of a comfortable wives room, inadequate 
parking and poor security in the stands during games. 
</P>
<P>
But the local media wasn't buying. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote one columnist: " . . . I'm sure there are better places for the Clemens' 
kids to play in Katy (Texas) than mine have on the Boston Common. . . . Perhaps 
Mrs. Clemens is dissatisfied with the spartan comforts of our public 
transportation system. You know, when she rides the subway, as I'm sure she 
does all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Added another: "And why can't the Red Sox provide Mrs. Rocket with a cellular 
phone? What happens say, when she has to run out of the park because little 
Koby filled up his last diaper? . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Those people wrote what they did because they wanted to get Roger," says 
Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks. "It's not like they didn't understand what he 
had been trying to say. I think a number of them thought Roger was getting too 
big for his britches and decided they needed to teach him a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"People talk about New York, but Boston's the worst place I've seen in 20 years 
in this business. There's a strange combination of parochialism and 
worldliness. It's not like I'm saying they're dummies, it's not like I'm saying 
they're rubes, but . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the uproar, Clemens signed a three-year, $7.5-million contract with 
the Red Sox in the spring. But the security he secured has not translated into 
success. He is 11-8, with a 3.21 ERA and 150 strikeouts. Good numbers to be 
sure, but not for the man projected to be the premier pitcher of his era. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has the long-term commitment Clemens made to Boston squared everything with 
the fans. They don't "lose their breath" at the mention of his name anymore, 
and the romance has cooled. 
</P>
<P>
So what about it, Roger? Roger? Roger?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That's another thing. Clemens isn't talking to the media this season, except on 
the days he pitches, and only about the game. In a second television interview 
six weeks after the first disaster, Clemens voiced anger at sports writers who 
had brought his family into the initial controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a problem with someone writing or saying things about me," 
Clemens said, "but when they start writing about my wife or kids, someone's 
gonna get hurt ..." 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Roger about that statement," Hendricks says, "and he just kind of 
winked at me and said, 'Maybe they (media people) need to think that for a 
change.' It was almost as if to say, they always think they're running the 
show. They think they're immune from pressure. But he's not gonna hurt anybody, 
that's not his style." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, western civilization has witnessed more mature relationships. 
</P>
<P>
To what extent the off-season flap has affected Clemens' performance is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger is a very tough guy mentally," says Hendricks, "so I'd say he was hurt 
by what went on, but not wounded. I think his feelings were: If that's what 
they think of me, fine. If they don't want to try and understand after all the 
things I've done up there, OK." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know all of what happened with the fans in Boston," says Charlie 
Maiorana, Clemens' coach at Spring Hill High School in Houston. "But I do know 
that if somebody verbally attacks his family, he's gonna take off on 'em. I 
also know that Roger felt he had put everything on the line for Boston, and the 
reaction really hurt him. He took it personally." 
</P>
<P>
"What Roger said, he said from the heart," says teammate Mike Greenwell, "and 
people took it the wrong way. It's affected him. It goes to show how fast fans 
can turn on you. Say just one wrong thing and you're a bad guy. And Roger's a 
great guy. He was just trying to make things better for the team and better for 
the wives. And he did." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, as usual, worked hard in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three major-league pitchers who work out here at the high school," 
Maiorana says, "and they all have good work ethics. But Roger's is far beyond 
anyone's. Sometimes I have to go tell him that's enough for today. Roger wants 
to be the best pitcher in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Following the off-season, Clemens was pronounced fit and ready to resume firing 
in spring training, but 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I've noticed since the All-Star break last season is that there is a 
difference in his velocity," says Red Sox catcher Rick Cerone. "This year he's 
shown signs of getting back to where he was early last season, but he's still 
not throwing as hard as he was. 
</P>
<P>
"But those things happen because you throw so many pitches. You reach back to 
get that 96-m.p.h heater and it's not always there. But he knows how to pitch, 
and that's what keeps him in games. His fastball has been around 90, and he may 
not think that's good, but to me 90 m.p.h is plenty good enough." 
</P>
<P>
"He's throwing more breaking balls than you'd like to see, because his fastball 
is still there," says Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman. "Some say it's down 
to 91 or 92, but you're not going to throw 95 all the time."

PERSONAL HEALTH: BUFFALO MEAT GETS TOP BILLING IN HER DIET FOR LOW FAT, HORMONE 
CONTENT; 
</P>
<P>
YOUR BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Laskin is not your typical throw-the-beefsteaks-on-the-barbie summer 
hostess. Instead of picking up a few sirloins at the corner market, the North 
Hollywood book researcher express-mails buffalo steaks from a San Francisco 
game firm. 
</P>
<P>
She's not aiming to win the avant-garde hostess of the year award, but to 
improve the diet of her family and friends. She finds that buffalo has less 
cholesterol, less fat and a lot fewer hormones than beef. 
</P>
<P>
Healthful eating, not adventure, underlies the increasing demand for buffalo 
meat, suppliers say. Orders are up from restaurants, gourmet markets and 
consumers even though the price is steep. Buffalo burgers run about $5 a pound, 
about twice the cost of beef hamburger; buffalo tenderloin can reach as high as 
$17 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Certain cuts of buffalo have less than half the cholesterol of beef, claims 
Mitch Niayesh of Polarica Game U.S.A., a San Francisco game and poultry 
supplier. And buffalo can be half as fatty as beef, adds Lisa Senauke, manager 
of the Game Exchange, also located in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But dietitian Nancy Becker is skeptical of the lower-cholesterol claim. "Almost 
all meat, fish and poultry have similar amounts of cholesterol," says Becker, 
chairman of the nutrition committee for the American Heart Assn.'s Greater Los 
Angeles affiliate. "Each 3-ounce serving -- a portion about the size of a deck 
of cards -- has 100 milligrams of cholesterol, a third the maximum daily intake 
recommended by the American Heart Assn." 
</P>
<P>
The lower-fat claim is easier for Becker to swallow: "Buffalo probably is much 
leaner than beef. Fat contents between cuts of meat and types of animals can 
vary widely." When figuring fat savings, be sure to compare similar cuts of 
meat, she adds. "And if you like buffalo, enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Healthier Babies 
</P>
<P>
Taking time out between pregnancies doesn't just give Mom a breather. It might 
also improve the chances of having a heavier -- and healthier -- baby. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of a Harvard study of nearly 4,500 women, just reported 
in the journal, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. Women who waited 18 months or less 
between delivery and a subsequent conception were twice as likely to give birth 
to a low-birth weight baby than mothers who waited 24 to 36 months. "The 
highest risk (of small babies) was associated with the very shortest interval," 
says Dr. Ellice Lieberman, assistant professor of maternal and child health at 
the Harvard University School of Public Health. "Especially at risk were those 
with less than a three-month pregnancy interval." 
</P>
<P>
In the study, babies were considered small if their weight fell below the tenth 
percentile. Statistically, small babies have a higher risk of infant death and 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
The study may not apply to everybody. "If a woman has the luxury of time on her 
side, it may be better to wait awhile between pregnancies," says Dr. Charles M. 
March, USC professor of obstetrics and gynecology. "But women over 35 have to 
weigh the risks of having small babies against such risks as giving birth to a 
Down's syndrome baby." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William A. Frumovitz, an obstetrician-gynecologist at St. John's Hospital 
and Health Center in Santa Monica, calls the research intriguing but won't 
change his advice to prospective parents: "Assuming the woman has no health 
problems, deciding intervals between pregnancies is more a matter of family 
preference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sleep Eye-Opener 
</P>
<P>
As people age, the phrase "sleeping like a baby" may become more like a fairy 
tale than a real bedtime story. 
</P>
<P>
Relax, sleep researchers say. Even good sleepers should expect their sleep 
patterns to change with advancing birthdays. What's realistic? At age 30, a 
good sleeper might expect to drop off in about 10 minutes, stay asleep all 
night and wake up refreshed, says Michael Stevenson, the clinical director of 
the North Valley Sleep Disorders Center in Mission Hills. But at age 60, even a 
good sleeper might take a half hour to fall asleep, awaken several times during 
the night and sometimes get up tired. 
</P>
<P>
Depressing as that may sound, here's heartening advice, especially for older 
slug-a-beds: Lolling in bed an extra hour or so, even if you doze on and off, 
may improve daytime alertness, Stevenson says. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad idea, agrees Dr. Philip Westbrook, a sleep expert at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center, as long as you can spare the time and you don't overdo it. "A 
little extra time in bed leads to more sleep, even if you think you won't 
sleep," he finds. "But avoid overkill.Don't try, for instance, to get eight 
hours of sleep by spending 12 in bed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iron and Athleticism 
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency often strikes women, causing fatigue and anemia, but it can 
also affect very active men. In a recent study, Canadian researchers found the 
more frequently male athletes worked out, the lower their blood level of this 
essential mineral, regardless of theamount of iron-rich foods they consumed. 
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency is still rare in men, observes Rodney Bassett, exercise 
physiologist at Centinela Hospital's Fitness Institute in Culver City, but he 
has found it in long-distance runners who log 40-60 miles a week, don't eat 
much red meat and are trying to reduce body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic men who follow an intense training regimen or who experience 
unexplained fatigue, should ask their doctors to check for iron deficiency, 
Bassett and the Canadian researchers agree.

ART BUCHWALD: LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED AT EXXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an environmental dream come true. The Exxon oil company announced it had 
completed its Alaska oil spill cleanup to everyone's satisfaction and by 
September would close up shop. 
</P>
<P>
The man responsible for the Exxon success was Joe Sludge, who has personally 
shined 90% of all the rocks in Valdez. Joe was in Washington to testify in 
front of a congressional committee, and I found him sitting by the reflecting 
pool, cleaning oil sludge from between his toes. 
</P>
<P>
"No one thought you could do it," I said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe replied, "I couldn't have done it without the help of the captain of the 
Valdez and his merry crew, as well as my superiors in the home office. A 
company like Exxon doesn't operate in a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you permitted to tell me how you won the environmental battle?" 
</P>
<P>
"We just took a page out of Vietnam. We fought the good fight and then we said, 
'The hell with it -- we'll finish up next spring.' " 
</P>
<P>
"How many rocks did Exxon polish up after the spill?" 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more than anyone can imagine. But it isn't just cleaning them that we 
should get credit for. There are rocks in Valdez you can eat a smoked salmon 
off of -- that is, if you can find a salmon in Valdez. But the main point is 
that Exxon gave it its best shot and now it's Mother Nature's turn to do some 
of the dirty work." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe, everyone knows you have been diligent in saving the shoreline of Alaska, 
but you have to admit there wouldn't have been a spill if it hadn't been for 
Exxon. Shouldn't a neutral party decide when it's time to hang up the towel?" 
</P>
<P>
"The only ones to judge such an important matter are the stockholders. After 
all, the cost of the cleanup is coming out of their pockets. Most of our 
stockholders care more about the environment than Exxon critics." 
</P>
<P>
"Why is that?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because they have a vested interest in how much Exxon spends to clean up its 
mess. Unlike environmentalists, stockholders don't let sentiment interfere in 
tough crude-oil decisions. Exxon management could waffle at any time, but the 
pragmatic stockholder never will." 
</P>
<P>
"I can see that the stockholders are less sentimental about Alaska's 
environment, but doesn't a non-negotiable pullout jeopardize the good name of 
Exxon?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, because the American people are fair. They know good spills from bad 
spills. Valdez could have been a disaster if we hadn't cleaned up the rocks. 
The Alaskan shoreline is far more spic and span now than it was before the 
spill. If Exxon hadn't had such a top-flight training program, the brave 
captain of Valdez might have beached his ship in San Francisco harbor." 
</P>
<P>
"Or perhaps in one of the Great Lakes," I added. 
</P>
<P>
Joe said, "If you want the truth, the reason Exxon is signing off is that we're 
sick and tired of doing everybody else's laundry. Do you know that I have 
personally cleaned rocks along the shore, and I am certain that the oil on them 
did not come from our ship?" 
</P>
<P>
"If you were so sure, why didn't you just throw those rocks back in the sea?" I 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Exxon doesn't operate that way. When it comes to oil spills, our 
policy has always been to clean every stone -- with no questions asked. That's 
why we're known in the oil business as Mr. Clean of the Sea."

SATIRICAL TRAVELS WITH DALE GONYEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Gonyea, it says here, has been "described by the critics as a cross 
between Victor Borge, Dick Shawn and Robert Morse." 
</P>
<P>
In their younger years, presumably. Gonyea is only in his 30s, after all. Nor 
is he as fixed a talent as the above, although definitely a talent. He is still 
figuring out what he wants to do when he grows up. 
</P>
<P>
What he does now, mostly, is sit at the piano and make musical fun of things. 
His current program at the Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theatre includes 
well-placed tweaks at Jacques Brel for not being able to get off that one note, 
and at "Phantom of the Opera" for its sluggish chandelier, here shrunk to the 
size of a candelabra. 
</P>
<P>
A wicked notion, but not lethal. Gonyea is not one of those satirists who don't 
take prisoners. He looks as innocent as a curate entertaining at Hawaiian Night 
in the parish hall. Just listen to Father Tim tickle the ivories. You can tell 
he studied with the nuns. 
</P>
<P>
Gonyea's new show is called "An American in Pasadena." At least that's what he 
calls it when he's playing Pasadena. Its theme is travel: places that Gonyea 
has visited, happily or not. He went to Russia, so he tells us about that. He 
went home to Michigan for a wedding, so we hear about that. (And get a 
sentimental song about the old family restaurant.) 
</P>
<P>
Now and then a funny hat comes out of his suitcase, but not always. The show 
isn't strong on consistency. Some numbers fit the theme, others don't. The 
suitcase doesn't so much say travel as it says trunk, the trunk where every 
songwriter puts aside material for a rainy day. This seems to be the day. 
</P>
<P>
Gonyea's piano work is fluent and crisp, much better than Father Tim's. There's 
a droll number about what goes through a pianist's mind at a recital, and one 
notes that Gonyea's pianism is indeed of recital quality. There's a craftsman 
with standards here. 
</P>
<P>
As a musical satirist, his standards aren't so critical. He tends to accept 
every idea that comes to him, rather than screening it for originality and 
aptness of thought. The on-the-mark numbers outpoint the off-the-mark ones, but 
not by a wide-enough margin. "Times Square Squaredance" sounds like a number 
for some 1950s musical that the director threw out in Boston. And it's not news 
that knock you up means something different in London. 
</P>
<P>
Gonyea's show fills up its 90 minutes pleasantly. At the same time, there's the 
sense of a talent that can go in any number of different directions, and can't 
quite decide which direction to take. "When you come to the fork in the road, 
don't move until they give you a full place setting," is one of Gonyea's 
mottoes. Actually, you don't get the place setting until you make your move. 
</P>
<P>
At 39 S. El Molino Ave., Pasadena. Plays Tuesday-Friday at 8:30 p.m., Saturday 
at 5:30 and 8:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Closes Sunday. Tickets 
$22. (818) 356-PLAY.

TUBES' DEMISE WAS SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sole redeeming factor of the Tubes' farewell tour of a couple of years back 
was the "farewell" part, promising that listeners would never again have to 
endure such an empty, devitalized spectacle. But, as with Jason and Freddy 
Krueger, killing this band once obviously wasn't enough. While one would 
hesitate to say they were alive, several of the Tubes' alumni were indeed up 
and moving around Sunday evening at Irvine's recently opened Mick's nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
When they first hit 14 years ago, the Tubes staked their fame on calculatedly 
outlandish, big-budget stage productions, satirizing "straight" media, and on 
the antic stage presence of singer Fee Waybill. But even with Waybill in tow, 
the "farewell" tour displayed the tired paces of a band long bereft of ideas or 
passion. Without him -- and with the theatrics reduced to a beer-chugging 
contest and new singer David Killingsworth donning Day-Glo sweats for one song 
-- Sunday's show was scarcely an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
To the band's credit, it didn't fall back on a pandering, greatest-hits set; 
little more than "What Do You Want From Life?," "White Punks on Dope" and the 
mawkish AOR hit "Don't Want to Wait Anymore" were drawn from its familiar 
catalogue. Less to its credit, the two-hour, 22-song show of lesser lights and 
new material was a grinding, undistinguished bore. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, it was writer-guitarists Bill Spooner and Roger Steen who reportedly had 
resisted the move to commercialize the band's music in the early '80s (The two 
were even replaced in the studio by Toto's Steve Lukather for much of 1981's 
crossover "The Completion Backward Principle" album). Now, under the pair's 
direction, the Tubes seem to be striving for the commonplace with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Songs from an unreleased new album, "Hoods From Outer Space," were so 
middle-of-the-road that they could have been road kills, with Killingsworth and 
Spooner trading off faceless vocals over the band's scarcely defined, 
guitar-based backing. Playing to a half-capacity audience, some of whom 
expressed doubts that it was even the Tubes on stage, Spooner's mid-show 
announcement of "We're going to play until you have fun," was threat enough to 
hasten the steady trickle of persons toward the exit. 
</P>
<P>
When he first came along in the late '70s, opener Greg Kihn was considered by 
many to be as promising as his contemporary, Tom Petty. While Petty now 
headlines amphitheaters and Kihn is stuck opening for the likes of the Tubes, 
the disparity in their fortunes doesn't seem to have affected Kihn's sense of 
fun. If his loose, easygoing solo acoustic set didn't push for rock nirvana the 
way Kihn may have back in the days when Bruce Springsteen touted his talents 
and penned songs for him, Kihn at least still knows how to enjoy himself and 
how to convey that enjoyment to his audience. 
</P>
<P>
Kihn's voice has grown raspy, sounding as if he has a few of Eric Burdon's 
teeth lodged in his throat, and his lone guitar was no match for his tight band 
of old, but he still turned in motivated versions of his "(Our Love's in) 
Jeopardy" and "I Can't Stop," Springsteen's "Rendezvous," and rock oldies 
including Tommy Roe's "Sheila" and Johnny Horton's "The Battle of New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
Opened two months ago, and christened as a name rock venue in early July with a 
Busboys show, Mick's (attached to Irvine's McCormick and Schmick's restaurant) 
shows potential as a music club. With a large dance floor abutting the stage, 
limited sight lines from its seats, and far fewer seats than its 380-person 
capacity rating, the club is clearly best suited to dance-oriented bands. The 
sound isn't bad; the fern-bar atmosphere doesn't clash much with the rock 'n' 
roll posters and other trappings (except perhaps with its unintentionally 
ghoulish stained-glass window depictions of dead rock stars), and there is an 
open-air patio one can repair to if things get too heated.

HIS WORST FOREIGN POLICY CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH CAN NO LONGER AVOID TERRORISM ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For six months since taking the oath of office, George Bush had carefully 
maneuvered to distance himself from the issue of terrorism, but on Monday he 
was plunged into the worst foreign policy crisis of his presidency by the same 
uncontrollable nemesis that damaged Ronald Reagan and ended Jimmy Carter's 
hopes for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the biggest political test for the Bush Administration to date," said 
Geoffrey Kemp, National Security Council director for Middle East affairs 
during the Reagan presidency. "The crises in China and Panama were not as 
serious, and American lives were not at stake. . . . This is a can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma confronting the Bush Administration as a result of the reported 
hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins extends far beyond terrorism, 
ranking current and former officials agreed. It threatens to jeopardize the 
Administration's efforts to move forward in several broad areas of Middle East 
policy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The fate of 14 other Western hostages in Lebanon, at least one of whom was 
the subject of a new death threat Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Efforts to defuse tension between the United States and Iran after the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death. 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S. relations with Israel, including the current American initiative on 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new Arab League initiative to resolve Lebanon's civil strife. 
</P>
<P>
Like his two predecessors, Bush has only limited options for dealing with the 
multifaceted repercussions of Higgins' apparent execution. The Marine officer 
was killed, according to his captors, in retaliation for the abduction last 
week by Israeli commandos of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, 36, a leader of the 
pro-Iranian Hezbollah organization. Obeid is believed by U.S. authorities to 
have played a key role in past incidents of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with terrorism is extremely difficult. You can often do more harm than 
good in responding," said Robert E. Hunter, a senior National Security Council 
director during the Carter Administration. "Very rarely is there ever a 
clear-cut situation where you can do things that are going to expiate the 
(American public's) feelings of anguish and at the same time aren't going to 
make matters worse." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of U.S. response is most immediately -- and dramatically -- evident 
in the fate of the 14 other Western hostages in Lebanon, including eight 
Americans. On Monday, a foreign news agency received anonymous telephone 
threats from the Revolutionary Justice Organization against Joseph J. Cicippio, 
an American abducted in September, 1986, and Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 
kidnaped in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There have been threats to kill other hostages unless Israel releases Obeid, 
but U.S. officials have no indication whether the threats actually came from 
those holding the hostages. Nevertheless, the threats limit American options. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Pressure 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. counterterrorism official predicted that the videotape of what 
apparently is Higgins' barefoot body swinging from a makeshift gallows will 
create unprecedented pressure on the Administration to act. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged: "There are no viable military alternatives that do not 
endanger the lives of other Americans. We have intelligence about where 
Hezbollah and the (Iranian) Revolutionary Guards have bases in Lebanon. But any 
strike might lead to harm of other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"And a decision to bomb, which would be easier and more efficient than sending 
in troops, would almost certainly kill many more innocent Lebanese civilians 
than Shiite extremists," he added. "The reaction to civilian deaths could in 
turn mobilize more support for the radicals." 
</P>
<P>
The Catch-22 nature of the situation reportedly is the main reason that the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended against a surgical military strike in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Joint Chiefs also said rescue attempts had virtually been 
ruled out, since several units under the Hezbollah umbrella hold the remaining 
eight Americans in different locations. It is unlikely that any military 
operation could successfully get all eight out at the same time, thus allowing 
time for possible revenge killings of those still held. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political options "dried up a long time ago," the counterterrorism 
official said. "There is no authority in Lebanon, and our policy has always 
prevented dealing directly with the captors." 
</P>
<P>
The one hope for eventual peaceful resolution of the prolonged hostage ordeal 
-- a gradual rapprochement with Iran's new regime -- also may have evaporated 
because of Israel's abduction of Obeid. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, State Department sources indicated that from this point of view, 
Israel's timing could not have been worse. The Israelis mounted their commando 
raid on the very day that the Islamic republic held an election for a new 
president to lead Iran in the post-Khomeini era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Access to Technology 
</P>
<P>
The winner, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, is widely viewed as a 
pragmatic politician interested in eventually ending the hostage crisis, in 
part to gain access to the Western technology and expertise needed to 
reconstruct war-ravaged Iran. 
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli action, the officials said, already may have forced the new 
leadership to renew the combative rhetoric that typified the Khomeini era. 
Iranian Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, one of the regime's 
hard-liners, called for a new wave of attacks against American and Israeli 
targets worldwide in response to the abduction of an Iranian ally in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than defuse the tension between the U.S. and Iran, the kidnaping of 
Sheik Obeid could well escalate the cycle of violence at the very time we had 
hoped for a breakthrough," a State Department specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
The Higgins situation and the potential diplomatic costs of Israel's action 
have angered some U.S. officials, especially because Washington reportedly was 
not alerted in advance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Were Never Briefed' 
</P>
<P>
"We were never briefed (about Obeid's abduction). We all learned about it when 
we turned on our televisions Friday morning," a State Department Middle East 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the Israelis never factored in the danger to American 
hostages," said another official. "That was a mistake, and a bad one, because 
they, more than anyone, know what can happen in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) echoed that criticism on the Senate 
floor. "I would hope the Israelis would take another look at some of their 
actions, which they must know in advance endanger American lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a longtime supporter of Israel, also 
criticized Obeid's abduction as a violation of international law. But, Dodd 
added, "to suggest that Higgins' execution was in response solely to actions 
taken by Israel is to blow it out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
What one official characterized as "new grumbling" about Israel comes at a time 
when the Bush Administration is facing a virtual stone wall in winning Israeli 
agreement on Palestinian elections. 
</P>
<P>
A Bush Administration official expressed frustration with Israel's 
"precipitous" raid on Lebanon. "This kind of unilateral action does not help 
create a climate conducive to peace or mutual trust anywhere in the region," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One angered former Reagan Administration official even speculated that the 
Israeli raid may have been an attempt to divert U.S. attention in the Middle 
East from the peace process to Lebanon -- "shifting the focus comes at a most 
convenient time for Israel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While seeking to avoid a full-scale confrontation with Israel over the effect 
of the Obeid abduction on the fate of hostages in Lebanon, Bush Administration 
officials made clear their belief that Israel seriously erred -- even if 
Higgins actually had been executed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential repercussion involves the Arab League peace initiative in 
Lebanon, initiated in May. The 22-nation body has given a mandate to the Saudi 
Arabian and Moroccan monarchs and the Algerian president to come up with a 
formula to end 14 years of civil strife by December. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sensitive juncture and, to be successful, they will have to get 
everybody on board," said a U.S. official monitoring the process. "This kind of 
incident can derail the process by exacerbating emotions." 
</P>
<P>
State Department sources conceded that they had been skeptical about the 
mission's potential for success even before the events of the last several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was the only ball game in town," said one official. "And, after trying 
to deal through Iran, restoring law and order in Lebanon was the only fall-back 
position" for eventually winning the hostages' freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"If this attempt collapses," the official said, "then we're really in trouble. 
And if the hostages are still in captivity and relations have not improved with 
Iran, heaven help us from thinking what will happen to them or how much longer 
they will be held." 
</P>
<P>
Current and former U.S. officials said the dilemma facing Bush is in many ways 
more difficult than the problems that confronted his predecessors because of 
the complexities, as well as the threat to American lives. 
</P>
<P>
"How Bush plays or copes with American outrage over the incident is going to be 
a test of his mettle," said Kemp, the former National Security Council 
official, "particularly since there was such a long track record of Reagan 
Administration rhetoric which, with the exception of the 1986 air strike on 
Libya, turned out to be a lot of hot air. He (Bush) has to be seen to be doing 
more."

The most recent episode occurred last week in Los Angeles when Ueberroth agreed 
to receive the attentions of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and an entourage of 
Democratic assemblymen. This crowd flew down from Sacramento with the mission 
of luring Ueberroth into abandoning his Republican roots and entering the race 
as a Democrat. As before, Ueberroth uttered encouraging code phrases to the 
supplicants, saying he wanted to "serve the public," but committed himself to 
nothing. Then he flew off to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
And so the churning started again. News of the meeting was passed on to 
reporters, who duly wrote their stories and speculated whether Ueberroth's hour 
had finally come. Sen. Pete Wilson, with a virtual lock on the Republican 
nomination, was sufficiently threatened by the news to arrange a hurried-up 
endorsement from President Bush. Meanwhile, the man at the center of the 
churning said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
This cycle has repeated about four times now. Peter Ueberroth, savior of the 
XXIII Olympiad, seems to be toying with California. It is a curious, 
Hamlet-like performance, full of ambivalence and arrogance at the same time. 
And yet California seems to have a vulnerability to this man. We seem to need 
him in spite of everything. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more remarkable signs of this need is the widespread belief, 
apparently shared by some political leaders, that Ueberroth could still win the 
election in spite of the extraordinary barriers that now stand in his way. On 
the Republican side, for example, the major players have long pledged 
themselves to Wilson and are not likely to renege, given Wilson's position as a 
U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
And to run as a Democrat, Ueberroth would be forced to overcome a legal 
challenge. State election regulations require that a candidate declare his 
political party a full year before the primary, which will take place next 
March. Ueberroth is still registered as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Add to all this the fact that Ueberroth, as far anyone knows, has not raised a 
nickel while the other main candidates -- Wilson, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein -- now have millions in 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Brown and friends knew about these problems when they came to Los 
Angeles last week. And yet they came anyway. Perhaps, as some have suggested, 
the visit was a warning to Van de Kamp, who has repeatedly bungled his campaign 
and managed to offend his Democratic friends at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but I think there was something more behind the Brown flirtation, and 
all the others that went before. California has slipped into an era where the 
political landscape is a bleak as the moon's, and the party leaders know it. 
Their candidates all seem to come from that same fraternity of C-minus, and 
voters are so weary of it they hardly bother going to the polls. Ueberroth is 
so valuable because he just might be that rare commodity, a leader; he might be 
all the things that Van de Kamp, Wilson and Feinstein are not. 
</P>
<P>
And there's something else. This state, in the midst of one of its greatest 
booms, is simultaneously paralyzed by decay. The schools don't teach, the air 
has turned the color of Coca-Cola, the cities jump to the sound of gunfire, and 
half of the state legislators have a rap sheet. In the last decade no one has 
risen out of the muck in Sacramento to deal with any of this. Peter Ueberroth 
brings with him the persona of the fixer, a man who makes things work, and if 
he succeeds in California he could just possibly take his party to the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the history of politics is strewn with the bodies of candidates who 
looked perfect until their first campaign. And Ueberroth, a well-known control 
freak, might find the messy world of the governor's race an intolerable 
environment. He might unravel, he might just be boring, and no one will know 
until he tries. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the reasons for wanting Ueberroth on your side are not bad ones, as 
Willie Brown and others have signified. So it is likely the courtship will go 
on. The creaky political apparatus of California needs and wants Ueberroth. 
What's not so clear is whether Ueberroth wants California.

DOCTORS HIT ON ANTI-SMOKING PROGRAM 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Three charitable health organizations accused the California Medical Assn. 
Monday of attempting to undermine Proposition 99, the voter-approved cigarette 
tax increase, by lobbying to cut spending for an anti-smoking education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Assn. and the 
American Lung Assn. told a news conference that the doctors' association was 
playing into the hands of tobacco interests by pushing lawmakers to shift $100 
million from the anti-smoking program to health care programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"The tobacco industry fears most of all this particular (anti-smoking) program 
because of the impact on their profits," said Dr. Lowell Irwin, president of 
the California division of the American Cancer Society. "They would love to get 
rid of it altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Medical association officials, however, said their decision to lobby for a 
shift in funds was prompted by their belief that expenditures on health care 
programs for the poor would be a more effective use of the money than an 
expensive media program. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not . . . in bed with the tobacco industry," said CMA spokesman Ken 
Todd. "We have been in favor of a smoke-free California long before this was 
ever on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure requires that 20% of the revenue generated by a 
25-cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax be devoted to anti-smoking 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the passage of Proposition 99, the health organizations and the medical 
association, two former allies in the campaign to win voter approval, have been 
increasingly at odds over the expenditure of an estimated $130 million 
earmarked by the initiative for educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
The news conference Monday followed an angry letter to lawmakers from CMA 
President William G. Plested III who suggested that some anti-smoking crusaders 
were motivated by hopes that they could gain monetarily from the educational 
programs. He said he had heard of one crusader who joined an advertising firm 
"in order, it is rumored, to give it an inside track on the community education 
contract." 
</P>
<P>
"This information is not presented for purposes of condemnation, but rather to 
illustrate that the anti-smoking crusaders are not always motivated by public 
interest or high ideals," he wrote. He claimed it was a former representative 
of the American Cancer Society but did not give a name. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin said the American Cancer Society was prohibited by its charter from 
accepting government funds so "there is no way this can be self-serving." He 
said the health organizations had decided to hold a news conference only after 
failing to reach an accord with the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Martin, a member of the lung association's board of directors, said the 
anti-smoking groups viewed the education program as the most important 
recipient of the tax monies "because it deals with prevention." 
</P>
<P>
She said the program would need the full $130 million to counter a 
$200-million-a-year tobacco industry advertising campaign. She said it would 
include anti-smoking programs in the schools as well as an advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Todd argued that there would still be ample funds left in the program after a 
$100-million transfer for school programs. There would not be funds for a 
massive advertising campaign, he said, adding that CMA officials believe that 
kind of program would be ineffective.

ABORTION RIGHTS GROUPS TO FIGHT CRIME INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of women's groups threatened Monday to go all out to defeat a 
proposed crime initiative that it believes could threaten a woman's right to 
abortion in California. 
</P>
<P>
And in a related development, Republican U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson acknowledged 
Monday in an interview that "some people will be confused" about where he 
stands on abortion as a result of the crime initiative, which he strongly 
supports. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilson is pro-choice, the confusion over his position could be a 
problem in his quest for the governorship in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, a majority of Californians are pro-choice, but some 
women became concerned about their protections recently when the U. S. Supreme 
Court gave the states more power to regulate abortions. 
</P>
<P>
What has Wilson suddenly on a hot seat is the Crime Victims' Justice Reform 
Initiative, which would speed up trial procedures and shield crime victims from 
some court appearances if it qualifies for the June, 1990, ballot and is 
approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would also have the U. S. Constitution's guarantee against 
unreasonable search and seizure supersede California's constitutional right to 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
That could threaten a woman's right to abortion, according to Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp, a candidate for governor on the Democratic side. His charge to 
that effect set off the current furor. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Burbank Monday, Janice Kamenir-Reznik, spokeswoman for 
the Coalition to Protect the Right to Privacy said, "This initiative contains a 
hidden time bomb for the women of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We challenge the proponents of this initiative to defuse the bomb before it 
detonates. . . . If they do not, we will be extremely outspoken against the 
initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups in the hastily formed coalition are the California Women 
Lawyers, the California Abortion Rights Action League, Business and 
Professional Women, Republicans for Choice and Planned Parenthood of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With ties to a number of Hollywood celebrities, the coalition has the ability 
to raise money for TV ads directed against the initiative and against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The privacy coalition wants Wilson and the California District Attorneys Assn., 
another of the initiative's major backers, to take the words "to privacy" out 
of the following section in the measure: 
</P>
<P>
"In criminal cases, the right of a defendant to equal protection of the laws, 
to due process of law, to the assistance of counsel, to be personally present 
with counsel, to a speedy and public trial, to compel the attendance of 
witnesses, to confront the witnesses against him or her, to be free from 
unreasonable searches and seizures, to privacy . . . shall be construed by the 
courts in this state in a manner consistent with the Constitution of the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mullen, executive director of the California District Attorneys Assn., 
said that section is "aimed at a philosophy" most associated with former 
California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, who held that the state right to 
privacy supersedes the U. S. Constitution's guarantee against unreasonable 
search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Burbank press conference Monday, constitutional law Prof. Erwin 
Chemerinsky of USC warned against tampering with the state Constitution's 
privacy clause. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that women currently have the right to abortion under the U. S. 
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in California," Chemerinsky said, "abortion cannot be made a crime 
(because of) the California Constitution's right to privacy. . . . But if Roe 
is overturned and the Wilson initiative is adopted, abortion rights in 
California will be gravely jeopardized." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Kent Scheidegger of the conservative Criminal Justice Legal 
Foundation in Sacramento argued that fears over what the crime initiative would 
do to abortion rights are "totally unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he had warned the district attorneys group last spring that someone 
might raise such fears if the section relating to privacy were examined 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
The solution now, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said Monday, is to amend 
the initiative and begin circulating it again to get the 650,000 voter 
signatures needed to qualify it by the end of this year for the June, 1990, 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't let this become a referendum on abortion," said Smith, who is running 
for attorney general in 1990, "and see the defeat of these badly needed 
criminal justice reforms." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that today he will try to persuade the state's 57 other district 
attorneys at their convention in Santa Barbara to take the words "to privacy" 
out of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson said in a telephone interview from Washington that he would not 
agree to that. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are opposing this initiative know that if we withdraw it and 
amend it, we'll never get it qualified," Wilson said. "There will not be enough 
time. . . . This is a cynical ploy by Mr. Van de Kamp to defeat criminal 
justice reforms he and his supporters are opposed to." 
</P>
<P>
Those supporters, Wilson said, are trial lawyers, especially criminal defense 
attorneys, who Van de Kamp has acknowledged are steady contributors to his 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal lawyers oppose one section of the initiative that would bar their 
participation in the selection of jurors and another section that would allow 
more hearsay testimony in preliminary hearings than is currently permitted in 
California courts.

BITTER CHARGES EXCHANGED BY VIETNAM, KHMER ROUGE 
</P>

<P>
Representatives of Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge, the main battlefield opponents 
in the 10-year war in Cambodia, showed no hint of compromise Monday as they 
exchanged bitter charges of torture and genocide during opening-round speeches 
at the international peace conference on Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pol Pot regime," said Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, 
referring to the notorious Khmer Rouge leader, "must be totally eliminated just 
like the fascist regimes in Germany and Italy and the military regime in Japan 
were eliminated after the Second World War." 
</P>
<P>
Khmer Rouge representative Khieu Samphan countered: "The Vietnamese crimes, by 
their scale and atrocity are no less than those committed by the Nazis during 
the Second World War." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demonstrates Gap 
</P>
<P>
The accusations, contained in opening speeches by the two main protagonists, 
demonstrate the gap that must be closed before an agreement can be reached at 
the monthlong conference that began here Sunday under the sponsorship of France 
and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized amid widespread fears that a bloody civil war will 
erupt in Cambodia unless an interim, multi-party government can be established 
before Vietnam withdraws its estimated 60,000 to 90,000 troops by Sept. 27, as 
it has promised. 
</P>
<P>
After all the conference participants, including the United States, the Soviet 
Union and China, had concluded their opening statements Monday, there appeared 
to be little obvious inclination to compromise among the main parties. 
</P>
<P>
However, former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who is favored by 
most countries as the best interim political leader after the Vietnamese 
withdrawal, expressed hope for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere in the conference room is one of optimism. There is a strong 
current toward a solution," Sihanouk told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said the key country in the conference is China, the main military 
supplier to the Khmer Rouge, the ultra-leftists whose reign of terror gripped 
Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, when an estimated 1 million people were killed 
or died of starvation. Well-supplied and disciplined, the Khmer Rouge is still 
considered to be the most effective fighting force among the four main branches 
of the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Any political solution that does not include the Khmer Rouge, Sihanouk and 
others have warned, would result in the almost certain outbreak of civil war 
after the Vietnamese troops leave. And the key to gaining the cooperation of 
the Khmer Rouge, he said, is its Chinese arms supplier. 
</P>
<P>
"China can do a lot. China can choose to stick with the Khmer Rouge. It is for 
China to decide," Sihanouk said. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Monday that was harshly critical of Vietnam, Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen said his country would consider withdrawing its military 
support for the Khmer Rouge and other Cambodian resistance parties only if 
there was "a genuine and complete Vietnamese troop withdrawal under 
international supervision." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese conditions for the withdrawal, outlined by Qian are severe: "Vietnam 
should withdraw all its armed forces in Cambodia, including its military 
advisers, disguised military personnel, armed militia among the Vietnamese 
immigrants and also all of its weapons, ammunition and other military materiel. 
None of these should be left behind in Cambodia in any form, nor should they 
return to Cambodia under any pretext or in any fashion."

BAKER, CHINESE OFFICIAL DISCUSS PRESERVING TIES 
</P>

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with China's foreign minister for 90 
minutes Monday in what he described as an attempt to preserve Sino-American 
cooperation in the wake of the suppression of the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first high-level contact between U.S. and Chinese officials 
since President Bush banned government-to-government exchanges as part of the 
sanctions he imposed after the Tian An Men Square massacre in June. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said his meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen did not violate the 
President's ban because both men were in Paris for the opening of a 20-nation 
Cambodian peace conference. The prohibition was on visits by officials of one 
country to the other, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went on With Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Baker went ahead with the Qian meeting and with a subsequent strategy session 
on Cambodia despite reports of the murder of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins 
by Islamic extremists in Lebanon. U.S. officials said Baker requested the 
session with Qian. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Paris, Baker spoke with Bush by telephone, presumably about the 
Higgins case and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to reporters after the meeting, Baker said he and Qian 
talked about China's suppression of the pro-democracy movement but "we 
discussed also the fact that over the course of the past 10 or 12 years, both 
countries have engaged in expanded efforts to build up a relationship that, 
frankly, we should seek to preserve if we can." 
</P>
<P>
The senior State Department official later told reporters aboard Baker's 
aircraft on the way back to Washington that the secretary of state had told 
Qian that the American public does not "understand" the repression of the 
democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The official said Baker warned China that further bloodshed would "represent a 
problem to the preservation of the relationship" between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
He left little doubt that Qian reacted angrily to the U.S. criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"There is clearly a difference of approach in the way that they view the events 
that took place," the official said. "We simply had a frank and candid 
discussion (diplomatic language for a controversy) of that aspect of the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"While the Administration, the President, wants to preserve this relationship 
if possible, we can't do it alone -- we're going to need some help," the 
official said. "We're going to need some help from them. They need to 
understand the way the American people relate to the events that happened in 
China." 
</P>
<P>
The official added that the U.S. government believes the Sino-American 
relationship "has not just economic, but political and strategic meaning for 
both our countries." 
</P>
<P>
The official said Baker warned the Chinese against "turning inward" as a result 
of the worldwide criticism of the bloody massacre in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he and Qian also spent part of their meeting discussing the 
Cambodian peace talks that brought them both to France. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement on Cambodia 
</P>
<P>
The senior official said later that the United States and China are in general 
agreement on most aspects of the Cambodia question despite a continuing -- and 
basic -- dispute over the role of the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
As much as possible, Washington wants to isolate the Khmer Rouge, which was 
responsible for the murder of more than 1 million Cambodians when it held power 
in in the late 1970s. In contrast, China is the main arms supplier to the Khmer 
Rouge, which remains the strongest military faction of any of the Cambodian 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official said Qian agreed that the Khmer Rouge should not be 
allowed to resume a dominant role in any future Cambodian government.

HOUSE VOTES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR 32,000 CHINESE STUDENTS TO STAY IN U.S. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The House on Monday approved legislation making it easier for an estimated 
32,000 Chinese students residing in the United States to remain here and avoid 
persecution in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
On a voice vote, the House backed a measure by California Rep. Nancy Pelosi 
(D-San Francisco) deleting a visa requirement that such students return to 
China for two years before becoming eligible to apply for permanent residency 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that many of the Chinese students in this country have some fear 
about returning to the People's Republic at this time," Rep. Jack Brooks 
(D-Tex.) said. "They shouldn't be forced to go back to certain persecution, and 
this is the least we can do." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed similar legislation last month as an amendment to a sweeping 
overhaul of U.S. immigration laws. For final passage, the Senate must either 
act on the House-passed bill or the House must agree to the Senate amendment 
when it considers the immigration legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has opposed the measure as overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bush ordered Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to 
delay by 12 months the required departure of Chinese students whose visas had 
expired and to give "sympathetic review" on a case-by-case basis to those 
individuals who want to stay even longer. 
</P>
<P>
Pelosi's measure is one of several that have surfaced in Congress in the 
aftermath of the June crackdown by Chinese officials on pro-democracy students 
in Beijing. Like the Senate amendment, her proposal would offer long-term aid 
to those who supported the democracy movement and now fear persecution if they 
are forced to return to China. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 40,000 Chinese students in the United States, and 
32,000 of them have "J" category visas, which require them to return to their 
homeland for two years before becoming eligible to apply for permanent 
residency in this country, according to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement is intended to avert a "brain drain" of students from foreign 
countries, most of whom receive some financial assistance from their 
governments to study here. Pelosi's bill would lift that requirement for 
Chinese students living in the United States on the date of enactment, but 
would keep it in place for other foreign students.

President Bush, visibly angered by the reported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. 
William R. Higgins, broke off a cross-country trip Monday to return to the 
White House, saying: "There is no way that I can properly express the outrage 
that I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, facing the first major foreign policy crisis of his Administration, 
conferred with senior national security advisers for more than an hour Monday 
evening after watching what was characterized as a videotape of the murder on a 
television set in his office. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a most troubling and disturbing matter that has shocked the American 
people right to the core," the President told reporters earlier in the day. 
"Somehow, there has got to be a return to decency and honor, even in matters of 
this nature." 
</P>
<P>
Bush refused to say whether he is considering any retaliation for the reported 
murder of Higgins, who was kidnaped in February, 1988, by pro-Iranian 
terrorists in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Lacking 
</P>
<P>
But other officials quietly played down the possibility of retribution, saying 
that there is still too little information on who was responsible for the 
reported killing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a period of assessment," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
"We're not trying to engender any sense of drama. . . . There are a lot of very 
difficult issues here that make one proceed cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
"The President made it very clear that until the facts are known -- at least 
more facts than we have now -- there's no way you can make a definitive 
decision," said Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.), one of a dozen 
congressional leaders who met with Bush on Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exercise in frustration," Dickinson said. "If you do nothing, it's the 
wrong thing to do. If you go to military action, it's the wrong thing to do. 
And if you negotiate, it's the wrong thing to do. What can you do in a 
situation like this?" 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday evening, Bush issued an appeal to both Israel and the Lebanese 
Muslim terrorists who hold Americans hostage, asking them to release their 
captives. 
</P>
<P>
The President said he was sending "an urgent call to all parties, who hold 
hostages in the Middle East to release them forthwith, as an humanitarian 
gesture, to begin to reverse the cycle of violence in that region." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was an implicit slap at Israel, which touched off the current 
crisis by kidnaping a militant Lebanese Muslim clergyman, Sheik Abdul Karim 
Obeid, last week. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson and others said there is still some lingering uncertainty about 
whether Higgins actually had been killed and considerable uncertainty about 
whether -- if he had been -- he was hanged Monday, as his captors claimed, or 
slain earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a palpable sense of outrage over Higgins' apparent murder, fanned 
by the grisly videotape distributed by his captors of a body hanging from a 
noose, swept through the Administration and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I've rarely seen the President have deeper feelings," said Sen. David L. Boren 
(D-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The outrage is overwhelming," a State Department official said. "The 
Administration may be willing to (retaliate) . . . because of the strength of 
that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's response to the announcement of Higgins' execution was double-edged: a 
rapid and emotional public response, but caution in the private councils of his 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schedule Change 
</P>
<P>
The President learned of the terrorists' claim in Chicago, just before he was 
to speak to the annual meeting of the National Governors Assn. Deputy National 
Security Adviser Robert M. Gates told Bush that reporters who had seen the 
videotape identified the body as that of Higgins, officials said. The President 
decided almost immediately to scrap the rest of his scheduled two-day trip to 
Las Vegas and Oklahoma City and to convene his advisers at the White House to 
"figure out what might conceivably be done," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
On his way back to Washington, Bush telephoned Higgins' wife, Marine Maj. Robin 
Higgins -- a "wonderful, stoic individual who is going through sheer hell," he 
said. Then he called U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to seek his 
help in recovering Higgins' body, officials said. They said Bush had similar 
messages asking for help sent to the radical governments of Syria and Iran, 
which have good relations with Lebanon's Shiite Muslim factions. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush's meeting with his advisers appeared to leave most of the questions 
about possible responses to the killing still unanswered. Officials said that 
CIA Director William H. Webster went into the meeting prepared to explain the 
limits of U.S. intelligence on Higgins' captors; aides said Adm. William J. 
Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, planned to stress the limited 
chance for success of any military response. 
</P>
<P>
The series of briefings and meetings appeared to leave Bush, at the end of the 
day, as frustrated as he began. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a very strong sense," Dickinson said, "that if he could ever decide the 
right thing to do, he'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever options are considered, for every action there's a reaction," a 
senior military official said. "You may not actually have the last play. You 
have to factor in the collateral damage and the potential harm to other 
hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Experts on terrorism and the presidency, who were watching Bush closely in his 
first major foreign policy test, offered divided verdicts on the President's 
initial response. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at Washington's Brookings Institution, 
said Bush has successfully resisted both the idea of negotiating with 
terrorists and the lure of launching a hasty retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Past Dealings Recalled 
</P>
<P>
"Previous Presidents have had the same kind of problem, and all have handled it 
badly," he said, referring to Ronald Reagan's arms deals with Iran and Jimmy 
Carter's negotiations with Tehran over U.S. hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"A President with as much experience as Bush should understand that about 50% 
of what we think we know now is wrong, so his response should be more cautious 
than it would otherwise be," he said. "He has done the right pro forma things, 
but not much more." 
</P>
<P>
Terrell E. Arnold, a former State Department counterterrorism expert, also 
praised Bush's caution but warned that his emotional involvement in the issue 
could enmesh him too deeply in a personal confrontation with the terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a risk," he said. "The one wild card is the human factor. You don't want 
your leadership to lose sight of the human condition, but you don't want them 
to make mistakes because of it either." 
</P>
<P>
And one former Bush Administration official warned that the President may 
already have made that mistake by deciding to rush back to Washington -- thus 
escalating the pressure on himself to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary Pressure? 
</P>
<P>
"Terrorists want to draw attention," he said. "The chief of state has hurried 
back to Washington and is huddled in a corner. It's accomplished their 
objective. And it puts him in a position where his aides are always asking: 
'What have you decided? What have you decided?' He's put more pressure on 
himself than he needed to." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first real foreign policy crisis he personally has had to face in 
his term in office," said Geoffrey Kemp, an NSC official during the Reagan 
Administration. "I think that the biggest danger we face is that the American 
people are so outraged about this that there will be a demand for some 
response. And we saw during eight years of the Reagan Administration that 
rhetoric is cheap, but action is difficult." 
</P>
<P>
"He's got one thing going for him," Hess said. "It's early in the 
Administration, his popularity is high, and it isn't an election year. He may 
escape the pressure to 'Don't just stand there, do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the reaction in Congress was somewhat divided -- among those who called 
for immediate retaliation, those who called for caution and those who wanted to 
debate whether Israel should be blamed for precipitating the murder by 
kidnaping a Shiite Muslim leader in Lebanon last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to give (the terrorists) a punishing blow," said Sen. Alfonse 
M. D'Amato (R-N.Y ). "It's about time that the United States adopt a policy 
more like that of Israel and the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States should send the terrorists a message "that we'll seek 
them out, that we'll hunt them down. . . . This is nothing less than war." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't blow Lebanon up simply to avenge the life of one American," Rep. 
Dante B. Fascell (D-Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
"As for options, we're back to square one," said Sen. Richard G. Lugar 
(R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It's a horrible 
mess." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) touched off a furor when he suggested 
that Israel should be held at least partly to blame for the murder of Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't continually apologize for Israeli actions in this country when it 
endangers the lives of Americans in some far-off country," said Dole. "Perhaps 
a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelis would be refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of Israel were outraged by Dole's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"To blame Israel for what Hezbollah has done would encourage terrorists to take 
more lives," said Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). "Any intimation that someone 
else is to blame is turning the world upside down. . . . Israel does not share 
any of the blame."

HOUSE VOTES TO LET IMMIGRANTS TAKE CITIZEN OATH AT INS OFFICE

The House voted Monday to allow immigrants to sidestep backlogged courts and be 
sworn in as citizens at an Immigration and Naturalization Service office. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, only courts can perform the citizenship ceremony. Because of 
crowded court schedules, immigrants in some cities have had to wait months or 
even more than a year, according to a recent study by the National Assn. of 
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, a nonpartisan research organization. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is designed to help aspiring citizens attain what they have earned 
and what is rightfully theirs," said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), who 
sponsored the bill, which passed the House on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has already been approved by the Senate, and Administration 
officials said they expect President Bush to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration has no objections . . . " INS spokesman Duke Austin said. 
"There's a feeling that it will expedite the process and eliminate waiting in 
some geographical areas." 
</P>
<P>
For permanent legal residents, who must have lived in the United States for 
five years and met other INS requirements, naturalization is a two-step process 
involving an INS interview and a court swearing-in ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
An increase in naturalization applications has led to a backlog in the court 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, permanent legal residents seeking citizenship may wait as long 
as a year for a court date, the study showed. The longest waits are in Houston, 
ranging from 11 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, legal residents who meet all agency requirements could 
immediately be sworn in as citizens at the INS office, or they could request a 
court date. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant rights advocates hailed the change. "U.S. citizenship delayed is 
democracy denied," the research group's national director, Harry Pachon, said. 
"Court delays are a bureaucratic hurdle that could be eased through this 
legislation."

CREW TRAPPED IN CAPSIZED OIL RIG IN GULF;

Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana 
coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work 
vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the crewmen were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel and a fourth was 
plucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter. The Coast Guard also said 
there were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue divers, however, were unable to search the overturned service vessel for 
survivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves. The hope was 
that at least some of the crew would be in airtight cabins with enough oxygen 
to survive until help reached them. But Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead 
said the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in 
excess of 60 m.p.h. and waves were at 12 feet and building. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center in Miami announced that 
Chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the 
lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The 72-foot service vessel, leased to the Chevron Corp. by the Avis Bourg Co., 
capsized about 25 miles south of Morgan City, La. It is a self-propelled vessel 
with legs that can be extended to the ocean floor. The boat was ordered into 
port because of the impending storm. 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday afternoon, Chantal was about 200 miles south-southeast of 
Galveston, Tex., traveling northwest at about 10 m.p.h. Officials at the 
National Hurricane Service in Miami said the storm was expected to reach land 
some time this afternoon or evening. 
</P>
<P>
The best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the 
western Louisiana or upper Texas coast. Hurricane warnings were issued from 
Freeport, Tex., to Morgan City. Tropical storm warnings were issued as far 
south as Port O'Connor, Tex., and as far east as Mobile, Ala. Bob Ebaugh, a 
weather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was 
expected in southern Mississippi, Louisiana and East Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coastal residents began what has long been a ritual along the Gulf 
Coast during hurricane season, which begins in late spring and runs through 
early fall. Grocery stores began reporting a steady demand for hurricane 
staples -- bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows. 
</P>
<P>
One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should 
the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane. In that event, the 
Houston area would have "extensive flooding," said Bill Evans, flood watch 
director for the Harris County Flood Control District. 
</P>
<P>
Besides heavy rains and wind, the hurricane is expected to cause tides 5 to 7 
feet above normal. Chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the 
hurricane season June 1. Tropical Storm Allison dumped huge amounts of rain on 
Texas and Louisiana in June, and Tropical Storm Barry dissipated in the 
Atlantic without reaching land.

HOUSE OKS DELAY ON AIR SAFETY DEVICE

House heeded pleas by the aviation industry on Monday and agreed to let the 
government push back the deadline for installation of an anti-collision device 
on airliners by at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
On a unanimous voice vote, lawmakers passed legislation allowing the Federal 
Aviation Administration to extend the current Dec. 30, 1991, deadline for 
installation of the so-called traffic alert and collision avoidance system, or 
TACAS-II, to Dec. 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA would be empowered to allow even a longer delay if problems continued. 
The bill also requires a one-year study of the equipment beginning by Dec. 30, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate has yet to act on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
A law enacted in 1987 set the current dates for installation of the devices in 
airliners with at least 30 seats. The requirement would cover 4,000 U.S. 
aircraft and would cost an estimated $310,000 for each unit, including 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
Industry groups have complained that the devices, which are not mass-produced, 
will take a long time to manufacture, install, test and maintain properly. A 
slower installation schedule was also recommended by the Office of Technology 
Assessment, a congressional research agency, and supported by the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
TACAS-II can warn pilots of nearby aircraft and suggest a vertical change of 
course to avoid a collision. A less sophisticated version of the device, 
TACAS-I, is used by smaller, private aircraft.

INVITATION BY BUSH TO TWO-DAY MEETING ON EDUCATION WELCOMED BY GOVERNORS

<P>
President Bush on Monday called on state governors to meet with him in 
September for a two-day "summit" aimed at finding new ways to raise the quality 
of American education. 
</P>
<P>
"Together we can find ways to strengthen our schools, to enlarge opportunities 
and to improve our nation's educational performance," the President told the 
semiannual meeting of the National Governors Assn. here. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the governors welcomed the idea as a way to call attention to the 
problems of public education. Some were skeptical about whether much could be 
accomplished by such a meeting unless the President seeks additional federal 
funds to help state and local governments upgrade educational systems. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a summit meeting on education was first raised by Bush during the 
1988 presidential campaign, when he vowed to be "the education President." He 
mentioned the proposal again during a meeting with a group of governors in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Specific Proposal 
</P>
<P>
His remarks here Monday represented the first formal and specific invitation to 
such a meeting. Bush said that the conference would be held on Sept. 27 and 28. 
He did not say where. 
</P>
<P>
The President did not spell out an agenda in his 20-minute speech to the 
governors, but he did refer to the educational reform package he submitted to 
Congress last April, in which he proposed setting up a system of awards to 
encourage extra achievement on the part of schools and teachers and a 
$100-million-a-year fund to help start and expand so-called "magnet schools" 
offering special curricula. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't view (a summit meeting) as something like today, where I spend a few 
minutes and then take off," Bush said here. "This is going to be a session 
where we will have an opportunity together to take a considerable amount of 
time to discuss these issues." 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly will be helpful," California Gov. George Deukmejian said of the 
summit proposal. "I think the main thing the federal government and the 
President can do is to continue to focus the nation's attention on the 
importance of improvement in the quality of our educational program. By having 
a presidential summit on education with the governors, that's certainly going 
to highlight it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a good thing," said Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, like Deukmejian 
a Republican. "We need a national educational policy, and (federal officials) 
can help give us direction and help us pull together." 
</P>
<P>
"I actually think (Bush) wants to do something," Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a 
Democrat, said. "We ought to give him the chance." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can do anything but profit from sitting down with 50 
governors to discuss these issues," said New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, another 
Democrat. Cuomo said that Bush deserved praise because "he is showing interest 
in the issue and he is showing that he is willing to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cuomo said he is concerned that the President will simply "focus 
attention on the issue and leave the states to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Unless Bush relents in his opposition to new taxes, Cuomo said, "there is no 
meaningful way you can make progress" on education or any of the other social 
problems the states are facing. 
</P>
<P>
After his speech here, Bush cut short what was to have been a two-day trip, 
including Las Vegas and Oklahoma City, and returned to Washington because of 
reports that pro-Iranian Muslims in Lebanon had executed U.S. Marine Lt. Col. 
William R. Higgins.

The United States is preparing to store 600 new nuclear bombs in underground 
bunkers in West Germany to replace an existing arsenal, the Hamburg-based Stern 
magazine said. Stern said the United States is building 200 bunkers at nine 
bases to store the bombs following a 1983 North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
decision to replace its aging nuclear stockpile. The magazine named the new 
bombs as "B-61 Models 3 and 4." Nuclear artillery shells are also being 
replaced with more modern weapons, it added.

American arms sales to the Third World in 1988 rose by 66% from the year before 
while Soviet sales fell by 47% during the same period, the Congressional 
Research Service said, according to the New York Times. The newspaper said U.S. 
sales to the Third World previously had lagged far behind the those of the 
Soviet Union. U. S. sales in 1988 reached $9.2 billion compared to $9.9 billion 
for Moscow. U.S. and Soviet sales account for nearly two-thirds of all arms 
sales to developing countries.

Blazes whipped by hot, dry winds have destroyed nearly 20,000 acres of forest 
and brushland in California, fire officials said. One of the worst of the 
fires, an 11,700-acre blaze about 45 miles northeast of Fresno in the central 
Sierra Nevada foothills, was nearly contained. The arson-caused fire destroyed 
seven houses and forced about 2,500 people from their homes for a time. A 
5,700-acre wildfire in the Cleveland National Forest continued to burn out of 
control in a remote area of San Diego County. About 900 firefighters saved 13 
homes and structures.

Utah officials voted to free nearly half of a $5-million legislative 
appropriation to fund research into the University of Utah's cold fusion 
findings. An executive committee of the state's Fusion-Energy Advisory Council 
endorsed the university's request for nearly $2.5 million for the first year of 
cold fusion research. The goal of the research is to develop a cheap, 
relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible source of electrical energy. Next 
Monday, the full council is expected to approve the budget.

East German authorities jailed at least 674 people on political charges in the 
first half of the year, with twice as many expected to be imprisoned by the 
year's end, the West German Justice Ministry reported. It said that most of the 
prisoners were accused of "interference with state activity," a charge used to 
cover various offenses ranging from attempts to flee to the West to scrawling 
graffiti. The ministry added that one East German was sentenced to 18 years in 
prison for writing "perestroika will yet free us" on a Soviet monument.

The American Heart Assn. said it plans to give its own seal of approval -- to 
be used on labels and in advertisements -- to promote foods low in fat, 
cholesterol and sodium. Known as HeartGuide, the program would go into effect 
in February, 1990, but food manufacturers can submit products for testing now 
to see if they meet AHA standards, the association said in a statement. The 
group recommends a diet with less than 30% of total calories from fat or less 
than 10% of calories from saturated fat. It also would limit cholesterol intake 
to 300 milligrams a day and sodium to 3,000 milligrams a day. Initial food 
categories to be tested are margarines and other spreads, shortenings and oils, 
frozen dinners and entrees, canned and frozen vegetables, and crackers.

A bill to require drug and alcohol testing of all railroad workers who hold 
safety-sensitive positions was passed by the House. Cleared on a voice vote and 
sent to the Senate, the measure requires the immediate suspension without pay 
of any employee who tests positive for drugs or alcohol. It requires 
pre-employment testing, random testing, testing based on reasonable suspicion 
of drug use, testing after train accidents as well as part of regular physical 
examinations. The House passed a similar bill in the last Congress, but it 
could not reach a compromise with the Senate, which pressed for drug testing of 
all transportation workers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 TONS OF FOOD FOR POOR LOST TO THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Second Harvest Food Bank of the Greater South Bay disclosed Monday that its 
Long Beach facility has been the target of four break-ins in the past 10 days, 
resulting in the loss of two tons of food awaiting distribution to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to food, burglars stole office typewriters, personal computers, a 
printer, calculators, a tape recorder, FAX machine and various tools, such as a 
circular saw and drilling equipment. Also taken were two hand trucks, a small 
refrigerator and a microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director John Knapp said officials were in the process of upgrading 
security at the San Francisco Avenue building when the break-ins occurred. 
Originally serving only Long Beach, the food bank now helps feed the hungry 
from as far away as South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The facility collects food surpluses from manufacturers and wholesalers and 
then distributes these to 120 agencies serving the poor. Knapp said the 
break-ins have left the food bank down but not out. He hopes donations will 
enable him to replace the stolen equipment.

<TEXT>
<P>
The man who shot and wounded a Beverly Hills banker during a robbery at the 
banker's condominium Sunday may have been the same gunman who shot 48-year-old 
Andre Coffyn to death July 10 during a robbery at Coffyn's Michel Richard 
restaurant in the Wilshire District, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives noted that a Rolex watch was taken from the wife of banker 
Shokrollah Baravarian during the robbery in the garage of his home in the 300 
block of North Oakhurst Drive and that the man who shot Coffyn was believed 
responsible for a series of Westside robberies in which Rolex watches were 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
The general description of the suspect in all the robberies matches, according 
to Los Angeles and Beverly Hills police. Baravarian, 46, was shot in the right 
hand during a scuffle with the gunman.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG MEMBER, 14, CONVICTED OF MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old gang member was convicted of murder Monday for a May 26 shooting 
rampage near a South-Central Los Angeles junior high school in which one boy 
died and a man picking up his daughter at the school was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Commissioner Jack Gold also found the boy, who was not 
identified because of his age, guilty of three counts of attempted murder and 
one count of shooting into an inhabited dwelling. Eliazar Bivian, 15, died in 
the attack. He was shot twice in the head outside George Washington Carver 
Junior High School. The teen-ager faces a maximum 11-year term in the 
California Youth Authority. He must be released at age 25. 
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted as Jose Luis Mendez, 41, tried to drive away with his 
15-year-old daughter, who met him near a sports field at the back of the 
school. Mendez honked several times in an attempt to get the boy to move out of 
a roadway, then got out to confront him. The teen-ager drew a .38-caliber 
pistol and shot the man once in the stomach, then fled through an alley and 
reloaded before encountering Bivian at Wadsworth Avenue and 45th Street. 
</P>
<P>
After exchanging words, the younger boy fired twice, killing Bivian. He also 
fired at two 13-year-old boys before being caught by school security officers. 
The defense tried to prove that the John Muir Junior High School student was in 
a "paranoid state" at the time of the rampage, prosecutors said.

STAR-CROSSED LOVER KILLED BY RELATIVE'S BLOWS, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It had been a romance likened to a real-life "West Side Story," a tale of two 
star-crossed young lovers whose affair ran afoul of a barrio street gang. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the end, this drama's final act was more freakish than poetic. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Mavers, the former neo-Nazi skinhead who had been threatened by La Verne 
gang members for dating one of their former "home girls," died last week after 
he was struck in the head and chest by his brother-in-law, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mavers, 18, who just a week before had separated from 15-year-old Yolanda, 
apparently because of the gang harassment, collapsed Wednesday afternoon in 
Claremont when an aneurysm caused by the assault ruptured an artery in his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
David Padilla, 29, of Pomona, who is married to Mavers' sister, Seferina, was 
arrested the same day on suspicion of murder but was released Friday pending 
full results of an autopsy, according to Claremont Police Cmdr. Gary Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
The assault, which occurred in the driveway of a Claremont home where Mavers 
was doing yard work, apparently stemmed from a long-standing family dispute 
that was unrelated to his run-ins with the La Verne gang, Jenkins explained. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think if something was going to happen to him, it would have 
happened because of the La Verne situation," Jenkins said. "But it just had to 
do with the family. It was a verbal battle between the two that escalated." 
</P>
<P>
La Verne Detective Steve Kirk, who had talked with Jason and Yolanda at length 
about the harassment, said Yolanda was "pretty shaken up" when he called her 
about the incident. Her family, who asked that Yolanda's last name not be used, 
said she was too upset to make any statements. 
</P>
<P>
Their romance received widespread publicity in June when their skirmishes with 
Yolanda's former gang began to appear as regular entries in the La Verne police 
log. 
</P>
<P>
In all, officers made 10 arrests of gang members in the neighborhood that month 
for prowling, inciting a fight, threatening a witness and hurling a beer bottle 
at the couple's car. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a street gang harassing an Anglo youth for taking a Latina from 
their "turf" captured the imagination of dozens of TV producers and movie 
studios who clamored to turn the tale into what one film executive was 
tentatively calling "East Side Story." 
</P>
<P>
But police said the pressure was probably too much for the teen-aged couple. On 
July 13, they separated. Later that night, while no one was at home, an 
arsonist torched the tiny house that they had shared with Yolanda's mother.

POSTSCRIPT: 'PEOPLE WANT TO COME TO SOMETHING IN THE BARRIO THAT'S NICE. AND 
THIS IS NICE.'

When the restaurant named after renowed Mexican artist and muralist Rufino 
Tamayo opened last year, it was billed to be more than just another ritzy 
Mexican restaurant. The Los Angeles area certainly has enough of those. 
</P>
<P>
But this one was different, its backers argued, because of where it was -- on 
the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the East Los Angeles Community Union, a community development 
corporation that spearheaded the nearly $4-million venture, gambled that East 
Los Angeles -- viewed by most outsiders as a place too violent to live in or 
visit -- could support a chic eatery. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to come to something in the barrio that's nice," said TELACU 
President David Lizarraga. "And this is nice." 
</P>
<P>
Few expenses were spared to turn an old barn of a structure in the 5300 block 
of East Olympic Boulevard into a pink stucco showcase. Imported floor tiles and 
marble, three mini-waterfalls and several oversized tapestries of the famed 
master's works were made part of the structure that at various times housed the 
California Highway Patrol and the Brown Berets, the 1970s Chicano militant 
group. 
</P>
<P>
And the menu featured Mexican regional cuisine, a far cry from the traditional 
Sonora dishes that are usually associated with food south of the border. 
Selections ranged from huachinango flameado (whole marinated red snapper 
roasted in an open pit) to pollo pibil (chicken marinated in many spices and 
orange juice, wrapped in banana leaves and baked in the hearth ashes). 
</P>
<P>
But in 15 months of business, the grand experiment, as Lizarraga refers to the 
restaurant, has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
Business, particularly on weekday nights, has been slow. On many evenings, the 
harp player, hired to bring a touch of elegance while diners linger over their 
meals, plays to a virtually empty dining room that seats 165 people. 
</P>
<P>
While the restaurant seemed to hold its own with its lunches and catered 
events, the weekends also proved disheartening. Few patrons found their way 
into the Eastside establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Losses were such that Stanley Kandel, a developer who helped establish the 
glitzy celebrity-favored Spago restaurant, decided last December to pull out of 
the partnership that headed up the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overly Optimistic' 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was overly optimistic, considering the location," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lizarraga and TELACU officials admit to strategy errors that probably 
contributed to Tamayo's slow start. 
</P>
<P>
Prices ranging up to $22 were probably too high for area residents, and too 
much effort may have been made to attract Westsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the thing that supposedly set Tamayo apart, its location, may also be 
part of the problem. One Tamayo insider said it would be a "huge roaring 
success" if located on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
But Lizarraga, ever the optimist, is not about to throw in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new management team, the menu's selections were broadened earlier this 
year to include burritos, enchiladas, carnitas and other familiar dishes. And 
prices were cut -- $17.95 for the marinated and grilled baby goat is the most 
expensive plate. 
</P>
<P>
Also, residents in Montebello, Monterey Park, Commerce, Pico Rivera and other 
surrounding communities will be targeted in a still-evolving marketing 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm just a dreamer," Lizarraga said, "but I really believe there is a 
need for Tamayo to be here. We believe in the long-term development of East 
L.A." GEORGE RAMOS

FEAR OF TROUBLE CANCELS MEXICAN CELEBRATION 
</P>

<P>
In response to a melee that marred this year's Cinco de Mayo celebration at 
Lincoln Park, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre said Monday that the 
traditional Mexican Independence Day observance, scheduled for Sept. 16 at the 
park, has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastside councilman said he made the decision after determining that the 
city policy of allowing beer sales at such events needs further study. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than make a hasty decision on a long-term policy, I have decided to 
cancel the event at Lincoln Park," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is my intention to have both the Cinco de Mayo and Mexican Independence 
Day celebrations at the park next year." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre added that a scaled-down celebration, featuring music and food booths, 
would be staged at City Hall in conjunction with this year's traditional El 
Grito ceremony hosted by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the event, which traditionally takes place on the night before the 
Sept. 16 holiday, may be released next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged over the years that the consumption of beer at Mexican 
observances, allowed by the city because beer companies underwrite the 
festivities, have changed the focus and tenor of such holidays. Events to 
promote ethnic pride have turned into glorified beer busts, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mounting Criticism 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln Park observances have become a major part of the Southland's 
celebration of Mexican holidays, but criticism has mounted since more than 150 
police officers were called in to quell a disturbance that cut short the May 5 
celebration that attracted more than 30,000 people. One man was shot in the 
abdomen and several others were injured when fighting erupted between street 
gangs, police said. Six people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, who was present, said it appeared that the gang members had been 
drinking before they arrived. And authorities emphasized that the beer provided 
by an Eastside distributor, Miller Brands, did not contribute to the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre has used his political ties on the Eastside to induce beer 
distributors to sponsor events at Lincoln Park and Olvera Street. In exchange, 
the distributors were allowed to hoist huge promotional banners at the event. 
</P>
<P>
"There were huge 'Miller' signs at Lincoln Park while we were trying to figure 
out why we thought Cinco de Mayo was important," one critic charged. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Sanchez III, owner of the Miller distributorship that supplied the beer 
that day, could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the problem is not so much beer consumption as it is the 
entertainment. Rock bands attract younger, rowdier crowds and fewer families. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to make the entertainment more family-oriented," said Capt. Art 
Lopez, commander of the Hollenbeck Division. 
</P>
<P>
Political connections aside, Alatorre said the policy of allowing beer 
consumption needs more study after several meetings with community groups, the 
police and other interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think it is the issue, but it's one of the issues we have to 
look at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other considerations, including entertainment, security and whether such events 
should be two-day observances, also need more study, Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre's decision was quickly praised by the critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad he has decided to be prudent and cautious," said Lou Negrete, 
co-chair of the United Neighborhoods Organization. "It's critical that we 
reclaim our parks from the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Study Supported 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Lincoln Park Coaches Assn. benefited from the beer sales at 
Mexican observances, a spokesman for the group also applauded the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't solve a problem unless you study it correctly," said baseball coach 
Ruben Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
However, there will be no shortage of events to mark Mexico's declaration of 
independence from Spain in 1810. Major observances are scheduled at Olvera 
Street and at Belvedere Park in East Los Angeles, where beer consumption will 
be allowed.

HOPES RISE AS NEW SPECIES MOVE INTO SLUDGE OFF COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city biologists reported Monday that they have detected new animal 
life in the thick black blanket of toxic sludge surrounding an abandoned sewage 
discharge pipe in Santa Monica Bay, raising hopes that the severely 
contaminated ocean floor is staging a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The biologists said preliminary data from an ongoing study of the 
two-square-mile swath of gurgling jelly shows that several species of worms and 
mollusks have ventured into the area, described as the "Black Hole of Calcutta" 
by one marine biologist. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two years ago, when the city was forced to stop dumping sludge from 
the underwater pipe seven miles off El Segundo, the most remarkable inhabitant 
nearby was the solemya clam, a stomachless mollusk that feeds on poison sulfur 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
The new bottom life includes such creatures as the capitella worm and the 
parvilucina clam, both of which thrived in the past on sewage in less 
contaminated sediment outside the sludge field. 
</P>
<P>
The city disposed of hundreds of millions of tons of sludge -- a noxious form 
of condensed sewage -- from the pipeline over 30 years before closing it in 
November, 1987. The sludge blankets a steep chasm on the coastal shelf, known 
as Santa Monica Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the bottom of the canyon about 300 to 400 feet going down, it 
used to be a black featureless plain with incredibly soft sediment," said 
marine biologist John H. Dorsey during a report to the Board of Public Works. 
"The submarine would virtually sink half way down because it was very soft. Now 
it is very firm. We are getting new stuff on top -- hills and paths made by 
organisms." 
</P>
<P>
The biologists attribute the migration of life to the sludge field in part to a 
dramatic drop in the level of poison sulfur gas in the sediment. When the city 
was still dumping sludge, hydrogen sulfide concentrations averaged 600 parts 
per million in the area. Recent readings showed concentrations at less than one 
part per million. Uncontaminated sediment has none of the gas, which is a 
sulfurous byproduct of decaying sludge. 
</P>
<P>
The biologists also detected a drop in the level of PCBs, a pollutant that 
eventually becomes trapped in the fatty tissue of fish that feed on animals 
near discharge pipes. But they said levels of polluting heavy metals -- such as 
cadmium, mercury, copper and zinc -- have remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been pretty happy about how quickly things are moving into the area," 
said city biologist Scott Johnson in an interview. "To tell you the truth, we 
weren't certain what would happen. The hope is to get more animals living in 
the sediments. They turn the sediment up, which gets oxygen down into it, and 
further degrades the organic material." 
</P>
<P>
City biologists began taking tests of the underwater sludge field in February, 
1986, to compare levels of contaminants and animal life before and after the 
closing of the pipeline. The study is being coordinated by the Southern 
California Coastal Water Research Project. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce E. Thompson, a biologist with the research project, said in an interview 
that the preliminary data is encouraging, but he cautioned that true "recovery" 
of the ocean floor will not occur until crustaceans and echinoderms -- such as 
sea urchins and starfish -- recolonize there. Those marine animals, he said, 
are common in uncontaminated portions of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still a big chemical soup," Thompson said of the underwater canyon. "A 
lot of it is puzzling to us, too. It will take a little bit of analysis once we 
get all of the data together. We are missing some pieces of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
In their report, the biologists also said they have documented animal life 
migration to the area around the city's second discharge pipe, which still 
dumps treated waste water five miles offshore from the Hyperion sewage plant. 
</P>
<P>
Plant officials disclosed in June that improved sewage treatment has resulted 
in the cleanest waste water ever. The biologists said the cleaner water has 
attracted new species to the area around the pipe.

PRIMROSE TAKES CHARGE OF L.A. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth M. Primrose assumes her role today as president and executive 
director of the 1991 U.S. Olympic Festival in Los Angeles, becoming the first 
woman to act as chief operating officer of an Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Primrose, 41, succeeds Earl Duryea, who held the position for less than four 
months. In a letter to the board of directors last week, Festival chairman 
Harry Usher said that it had "become necessary to terminate" the relationship 
with Duryea. 
</P>
<P>
Usher, who was general manager of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, 
would not elaborate Monday, but he said that the parting was amicable. 
</P>
<P>
"Both he and I felt it was in the best interests of his future progress and the 
future of the Olympic Festival to make this move now," Usher said. 
</P>
<P>
Duryea, 51, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Duryea, whose previous sports and event management experience includes 
positions as president of the Harlem Globetrotters and manager of various 
arenas, Primrose has been involved for a number of years with international 
amateur sports. 
</P>
<P>
As a 15-year-old from Baltimore, she won a gold medal in the 400-meter 
freestyle swimming relay at the 1963 Pan American Games. In 1964, she missed a 
berth on the U.S. Olympic team by one place in the 100-meter backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
With an undergraduate degree from Stanford and an MBA from UCLA, she had her 
initiation into sports management as assistant executive director of San Jose's 
1981 World Games, which included 16 sports that were not on the Olympic 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that experience, she was recruited by the LAOOC in 1982 to work in 
the planning department and eventually became an associate vice president of 
ticketing. She was one of the final three candidates for the Festival's 
executive director position when Duryea was named April 7. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much I've learned through the World Games and the Olympics," 
Primrose said Monday, her last day as manager of external relations for 
McKinsey &amp; Co., Inc., a Los Angeles management consultant firm. "Almost by 
osmosis, I know what needs to be done, even though the framework of the 
Festival is different." 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Festival brings together about 
4,000 athletes in 37 sports each year except those in which the Olympics are 
held. The ninth Festival since it was originated in 1978 ended Sunday at 
Oklahoma City. The 10th Festival next summer will be held in the Twin Cities of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The USOC plans to hold its first Festival exclusively for winter sports in 
February of 1991 at Lake Placid, N.Y., before the L.A. Festival, which is 
scheduled for July 12-21.

EVERT WITHDRAWS FROM MANHATTAN BEACH TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chris Evert goodby tour got a little shorter Monday when she pulled out of 
the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, which starts next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, a five-time winner of the event and the defending champion, said she 
has not picked up a racket since losing to Steffi Graf in their Wimbledon 
semifinal match 25 days ago. Evert telephoned the Women's International Tennis 
Assn. Monday morning and said that she was withdrawing because she wasn't ready 
to play a competitive match. 
</P>
<P>
Evert's withdrawal cast doubt on her schedule for the rest of what she has said 
will probably be her last year. After losing to Graf, Evert said she would rest 
at her home in Aspen, Colo., and that her future on the tour was undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 4 in the world -- behind Graf, Martina Navratilova and Gabriela 
Sabatini -- Evert has not been No. 1 in more than seven years, except for a 
five-month period in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, played on the hard courts at Manhattan 
Country Club in Manhattan Beach, was supposed to be Evert's warmup event for 
the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 28 at Flushing Meadow, N.Y. If Evert intends 
to play the U.S. Open, there are two other tournaments she could use as 
tune-ups: the United Jersey Bank tournament at Mahwah, N.J., beginning Aug. 14, 
and the Player's Challenge Canadian Open in Toronto beginning Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, however, has not yet said for sure that she intends to play the U.S. 
Open, which she has won six times, but not since 1982. Unless she changes her 
mind, she is committed to play in the Federation Cup in Tokyo, Oct. 1-8, on a 
U.S. team that includes Navratilova, Zina Garrison and Pam Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, Garrison and Shriver are scheduled to play in the Virginia Slims 
of Los Angeles, joining Sabatini, Mary Joe Fernandez, Catarina Lindqvist and 
Hana Mandlikova in the 56-player field. THOMAS BONK

IOC OFFICIAL: STEROID USERS DESERVE LIFETIME BAN; 
</P>
<P>
ANITA DEFRANTZ SAYS STRICTER PUNISHMENT NEEDED FOR THOSE TESTING POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Athletes who test positive for anabolic steroids should be banned for life from 
competing in the Olympics, one of two International Olympic Committee members 
from the United States said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Anita DeFrantz, president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles and 
an outspoken anti-steroid crusader, said she intends to submit that proposal to 
IOC members at their annual session next month at San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she has not spoken with IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch or 
any of the other members about the proposal but believes it will be 
well-received. 
</P>
<P>
Under current IOC rules, an athlete can compete in the Olympics if he is 
eligible under the international rules of his sport. 
</P>
<P>
But as a result of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson's disqualification at the 1988 
Summer Olympics after testing positive for a steroid and subsequent revelations 
that he had been using the drug since 1981, there has been sentiment among some 
sports officials for stricter penalties. 
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of track and field, Johnson can return to competition in 
September of 1990 and is eligible for the 1992 Summer Olympics. DeFrantz said 
her proposal would not apply for Johnson because it would not be retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (IOC) medical commission has stressed rehabilitation of athletes who are 
using steroids, but I think it's time to send a stronger message," she said. 
"It's not like athletes are taking them because they have a cold. They're 
taking them to cheat." 
</P>
<P>
One person urging support of the proposal is Edwin Moses, a two-time Olympic 
gold medalist in the intermediate hurdles who is a member of the IOC's athletes 
commission and chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee's substance abuse 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the IOC athletes commission would favor that," Moses said. "So far, 
we've tended to go along with the IOC. But I think we have to do something 
that's going to have more effect in stopping the problem. Scare tactics about 
the health risks of steroids haven't worked. Maybe the answer is lifetime bans 
for those who are caught." 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz and Moses made their remarks at the end of a two-day conference at the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation that was described as the nation's first consensus 
meeting on the dangers of steroid abuse. It was sponsored by the AAF, the USOC, 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. and the National Federation of State 
High School Assns. 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on four areas -- research, education, testing and rehabilitation -- a 
report will be submitted to William J. Bennett, who is charge of the Bush 
administration's drug-control policy, in September. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question it was a worthwhile meeting," USOC executive director 
Baaron Pittenger said. "We developed an atmosphere in which there can be 
broader cooperation than we've ever had, and I think there will be some 
significant developments along these lines as we build on this foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Pittenger said he was particularly impressed by a presentation made Monday by 
cyclist Cindy Olavarri of Albany, Calif., who was disqualified from the U.S. 
Olympic team in 1984 after testing positive for a steroid and since has 
reported various physical and emotional side effects from her use of those 
drugs and others. 
</P>
<P>
"Life was very difficult for her the year after she was suspended," Pittenger 
said. "But no one from the USOC or from the cycling federation called her to 
find out how she was doing. I don't think any of us have given enough thought 
to what our responsibilities are to athletes who have fallen victim to 
steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that he was not stating a USOC position, Pittenger said he did not 
think DeFrantz's proposal would be popular with most international sports 
federations and National Olympic Committees. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'd have to say that I've observed a willingness among the 
federations to have standardized rules and sanctions," he said. "But everybody 
I see tends to lean toward a two-year suspension for the first violation and a 
lifetime ban for the second."

SHELBY BREATHES FRESH AIR INTO HIS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
DROPPED TO THE TRIPLE-A CLUB, DODGER OUTFIELDER WORKS ON HITTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From home plate here, above the 35 advertisements tacked to the outfield fence, 
John Shelby can see something he didn't see much with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
It is the sky, against the backdrop of the Sandia Mountains, dwarfing 
Albuquerque Sports Stadium. Here, the players on the triple-A Dukes can see 
farther than they will ever be able to hit or throw. 
</P>
<P>
The open spaces are just what Shelby has been looking for. While some come here 
from the major leagues to work on a pitch, others on a swing, the Dodger 
outfielder has come to take a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm not sure what's going on with me, but I know that being here 
will be good for me," Shelby said. "The atmosphere on this team is what I 
need." 
</P>
<P>
The starting center fielder on last year's World Series championship team was 
struggling this year with a .156 average when called into a meeting July 19 
with Dodger Vice President Fred Claire. Shelby, in his seventh major league 
season, was given a choice. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I could either come to Albuquerque . . . or be released," Shelby 
admitted Monday. "I asked them, would they let me play there? Would they let me 
try to get better? 
</P>
<P>
"He said they would. I told them I would come. And I thanked them. I thank God 
that I am here." 
</P>
<P>
This, then, is not the story of a moping, sulking, $550,000-a-year player who 
is mad at his demotion, the Dodgers and the world. This is the story of one who 
feels lucky things have not been worse, and is positive they will get better. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a humbling game," said Shelby, 31. "I have tried a lot of different 
things this year . . . so many things . . . and a lot of them didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers have given me one more chance, and I will take it. And I will make 
the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
Only nine months ago he was making diving catches on national television. Now 
Shelby is framed in center field by The Man's Hat Shop Billboard, featuring a 
wooden cowboy hat protruding above the fence. Once he once couldn't walk around 
a batting cage without bumping into cameras and microphones; now he and Dukes 
batting instructor Von Joshua have the place to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the batting practice pitcher quit throwing after a special session 
early Monday afternoon, Joshua and Shelby remained in the cage. With nobody on 
the mound, they continued breaking down his swing, building up his confidence. 
In his 10 days here, Shelby has attended early batting practice 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reluctant to approach him at first," Joshua said. "I was under the 
impression that since he was struggling so much up there, he must not be 
listening to advice, he must be hardheaded or something. 
</P>
<P>
"But then I realized it was just the opposite. He was dying for help. He was 
dying to change." 
</P>
<P>
Some parts of him were plain dying. He said what happened to him with the 
Dodgers this year was so unusual, so hard to explain, that it couldn't even be 
called a slump. 
</P>
<P>
"In a slump, you hit the ball well sometimes, but I wasn't hitting the ball at 
all," Shelby said. "I came out of spring training knowing that I wasn't hitting 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Considering Shelby hit .270 in his first two seasons with the Dodgers, with 31 
home runs and 133 RBIs, his bosses figured the hits would start falling. 
</P>
<P>
But it never happened. His batting average fell below .200 after 15 games and 
stayed there. When sent down, in 244 at-bats, he had more strikeouts (66) than 
hits (38) and walks (22) combined. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers still think the hits will fall. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't do what John has, 1,000 or so at-bats in the National League (970) 
without having ability," Claire said. "This year, in my view, it was a case of 
John trying to do too much. But we told John we haven't given up on him, and we 
haven't. He can still play in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Shelby said he wasn't thrilled when Claire gave him his options -- "I didn't 
have a big smile on my face, it wasn't exactly the happiest day of my life," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that, like many fans, he had been thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really surprised," he said. "And I think I'm still an everyday 
player, so I took the assignment. If I didn't, I would have taken the release. 
I know I can still play this game." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kennedy, the Dukes' manager who is highly regarded within the 
organization for his communication skills, had played with Shelby in an 
instructional league in 1977 while both were in the Baltimore organization. He 
was waiting for Shelby when he joined the team July 22 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
While coaching third base, Kennedy watched Shelby strike out three consecutive 
times. Then, batting left-handed against hard-throwing Ernie Camacho, Shelby 
drove a ball to left field for a single. He stole second and went to third on 
an errant throw. There, during a pitching change, they had their first good 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me and said it was the first time he had driven a ball to left 
field in a long, long time," Kennedy said. "You could just see how good he 
felt. You could see the weight coming off his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"So I told him about my career, and how for two years I hit .279, then .254 in 
triple-A, then the next year I hit .197. I thought I would never find myself 
again. But then the next year I hit .263 and everything was great." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, a former catcher, told Shelby he knows how these things affect the 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it gets so mental, sometimes you look out there and see 18 
fielders," Kennedy said. "I told John, 'You just don't lose that much ability 
that quickly. I told him to relax and have fun and it would come back." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Shelby is trying a new stance with his back foot firmly 
planted and his elbow closer to his body. 
</P>
<P>
"The things he has to work on are things that should have been looked at a long 
time ago," Joshua said. "He hit 21 homers his first year (1987) with the 
Dodgers and everybody forgets that pitchers would soon make adjustments to him. 
He needed to fix this then. 
</P>
<P>
"He has really worked to fix it now. When he gets back, you're going to see a 
different player." 
</P>
<P>
After 10 games here, Shelby is hitting .324 with two homers and nine RBIs. He 
said is doing this well by not thinking about coming back to the Dodgers before 
the rosters are expanded in September. He said he is not thinking about 
anything but this day, and the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go back up, I want to make sure everything is right with me," Shelby 
said. "I've learned, we're all blessed with ability in this game, but it's hard 
to keep it up for long. I appreciate that. I'll never forget it."

DUMAS ON 8-FOOT LEAP: 'WHAT TOOK SO LONG?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Dumas, the first person to high jump seven feet, had a crisp reaction 
Monday to news that a Cuban had become the first to clear eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
"What took so long?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 33 years and 30 days since Dumas, then a Compton College freshman, 
broke the seven-foot barrier at the 1956 U.S. Olympic trials at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really surprised it took this long," Dumas said. "After the Fosbury Flop 
became so widespread in the late 1970s, and they got the world record up to 7-6 
and 7-7 so fast, I thought someone would get to eight in the late 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, 52, and his son, Kyle, 17, were fishing for largemouth bass and catfish 
at Castaic Lake Saturday afternoon, probably when Javier Sotomayor was warming 
up for his event at a meet in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, a 6-foot-4, 21-year-old, cleared eight feet on his second try, 
breaking his own world record of 7-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, a driver education teacher at Jordan High School in Los Angeles, said he 
was falling asleep in a chair late Saturday night in his Inglewood home when he 
learned of Sotomayor's historic leap. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard someone say 'eight feet' and that got my attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine someone jumping that high. It's a tremendous achievement. When 
I think of how long I trained, how hard I worked to get that seven-foot jump, 
well, it's hard to imagine someone going a foot higher than I did. 
</P>
<P>
"After I did it, a whole bunch of guys went over seven, so now I suppose a 
bunch will jump eight, too." 
</P>
<P>
After Dumas had cleared seven for the first time, on the night of June 29, 
1956, he went on to Melbourne and jumped 6-11 1/2, winning a gold medal in the 
Olympics. Ultimately, he cleared seven feet 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
His event was subsequently revolutionized by Dick Fosbury, an Oregon State 
athlete who invented the flop technique -- clearing the bar on one's back as 
opposed to going over on one's stomach. Soon after Fosbury had jumped 7-4 1/4 
in winning a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics, old-style leapers became rare. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, who is 6-2, indicated that eight feet would still be a distant goal had 
Fosbury never been born. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the world record would still be between 7-7 and 7-8 if he'd never come 
along," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know one thing -- I never would have mastered the flop," Dumas said. "I just 
didn't have that kind of body. I would've broken my neck."

NEWSWIRE: VALVANO'S PROGRAM COMES UNDER ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Valvano should choose between his role as athletic director-basketball 
coach at North Carolina State and his outside interests, said Hugh Fuller, 
director of the school's academic tutoring program. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Monday by the News and Observer of Raleigh, Fuller 
also said that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Academic tutors hired by the athletic department did course work for 
basketball players, who then submitted it as their own. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Athletic department officials abused policies that allow students to 
withdraw for medical or psychological reasons in order to keep players 
academically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- School officials persuaded instructors to give players who were in academic 
trouble incompletes, rather than failing grades, allowing the players to remain 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Top university officials ordered one star basketball player reinstated to a 
study hall after the player had been kicked out for disrupting other students. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players were steered toward courses taught by sympathetic instructors.

HEAD OF TELEDYNE UNIT TRANSFERRED AS PENTAGON CONTRACTING PROBE WIDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teledyne has removed the president of one of its largest defense contracting 
divisions amid a widening federal criminal investigation into overcharging on 
government contracts, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The firm disclosed last month in a financial filing that the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service searched the 
Teledyne Systems division in Northridge and "removed documents relating to 
contracts and pricing." 
</P>
<P>
The filing, which was the firm's 10Q report to the Securities &amp; Exchange 
Commission, also discloses that "several Teledyne Systems employees have 
received subpoenas to testify before a federal grand jury." 
</P>
<P>
The existence of a grand jury indicates that the federal probe has advanced 
beyond a preliminary stage. Sources in the defense industry, legal and 
investment communities have characterized the investigation as a major civil 
and criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
In its filing, Teledyne said it is attempting to determine through a 
preliminary internal investigation whether it faces potential liability and, if 
so, how much. The company also said it is "currently unable to determine 
whether there is likely to be any material effect on our financial condition or 
results of operation." 
</P>
<P>
By declining to state that the effect will not be material, Teledyne is 
effectively raising a warning flag indicating a large potential liability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Relationship' 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne Systems President Harry Halamandaris was assigned to a new job on 
Teledyne's corporate staff as assistant to an executive vice president, 
spokesman Berkley Baker acknowledged Monday. Allen Orbuch, group executive, was 
named acting president of the systems division, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker declined to comment on whether Halamandaris' transfer was related to the 
federal investigation. "He was transferred and as far as I know there is no 
relationship, but I would have to check that out." 
</P>
<P>
Information about Halamandaris' transfer was rumored around the systems 
division, along with reports that a number of employees in the firm's pricing 
department had been granted immunity and that potential mischarges are in the 
tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of the investigation has not been disclosed, but apparently it 
involves a broad range of defense contracts going back 10 years as well as the 
way Teledyne administratively handled charges to those contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corroborates Reports 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the federal investigation was disclosed in a Times story in 
June. At that time, Teledyne had just announced a plan to examine the spinoff 
of its insurance and financial subsidiaries, a deal that would pare 20% of the 
firm's annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne's disclosure that the Defense Criminal Investigative Service is 
involved in the probe corroborates earlier reports that a defense criminal task 
force in Redondo Beach is involved in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation reportedly was prompted by the filing of a civil case against 
Teledyne under the federal False Claims Act, which allows individuals to sue a 
contractor on behalf of the government. Such cases are sealed for an initial 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
The False Claims Act provides for a 10-year statute of limitations, which 
apparently explains why investigators are looking at records going back 10 
years.

El Diario Seeks Bankruptcy Protection: El Diario de Los Angeles, a 
Spanish-language daily newspaper that debuted two years ago, has filed for 
bankruptcy. The owners are seeking to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, claiming assets of nearly $32,000 against liabilities of more 
than $23 million. Mexican investors had provided $6 million to start up El 
Diario as Los Angeles' third Spanish-language daily.

RIVAL CLAIMS PACBELL GAVE IT A 'VIRUS'; 
</P>
<P>
OWNER OF TALKING YELLOW PAGES SAYS PHONES OFTEN GO DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Michael Amin, it seemed a natural: a "talking" phone book for people who 
would rather deal with an operator than finger through the yellow pages. 
</P>
<P>
So, Amin set up a Los Angeles-based firm, Primex Talking Yellow Pages, to 
provide callers a choice of whatever category of company or service they 
request -- for example, a selection of physicians of a given specialty and 
working in a particular area. Then the Primex operator can connect the caller 
with the doctor he or she wants. 
</P>
<P>
But the hang-up for Amin has been Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company says it has been unable to find the electronic "virus" that, 
for 18 months, Amin claims, has bedeviled Primex. The result for Primex has 
been to have many of its 36 telephone lines go dead at crucial moments -- such 
as right after broadcast of television and radio commercials inviting the 
audience to call for a trial. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, Amin said, conversations are cut off in mid-sentence. And 
sometimes callers hear ringing while Primex operators hear nothing or, 
answering a ring, find no one on the line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Know the Cause 
</P>
<P>
Despite extensive testing by Pacific Bell technicians, who say they don't know 
the cause of Primex's problems, the company's phone troubles have persisted for 
18 months. Amin said they now threaten Primex's pioneering venture, which 
competes with Pacific Bell's yellow pages directories. He also noted that 
Pacific Bell and other former Bell phone companies have repeatedly -- and 
vainly -- sought court permission to enter the talking phone book business. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Amin lodged a formal complaint with the California Public Utilities 
Commission, whose consumer division expects to complete its evaluation shortly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PUC's five members held a final hearing in San Francisco on 
Monday to hear from businesses such as Primex before deciding later this year 
whether to accept proposals, submitted separately by Pacific Bell and GTE 
California, to change telecommunications regulation in the state. 
</P>
<P>
While different in many particulars, the two proposals aim to give the phone 
companies some flexibility in setting prices, speed commission decisions and 
strengthen the incentive to cut costs by lifting the present limit on utility 
profits. Instead, a share of the profits beyond a certain point would be 
returned to customers in the form of rebates. 
</P>
<P>
Amin and other telephone industry entrepreneurs have complained that giving the 
big phone companies more flexibility might clear the way for Pacific Bell and 
GTE to use dirty tricks and other unfair practices to drive competitors out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dennis Love has testified before the Assembly Committee on 
Utilities and Commerce that his Marin County telephone-equipment repair service 
failed after advertisements bought in Pacific Bell's local phone books were 
botched in two of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
In Amin's case, the business is still running, although the number of employees 
has plunged to 30 from a high of 70 when the company moved to larger quarters 
near Los Angeles International Airport. That same day, Feb. 1, 1988, the young 
company's local telephone service unaccountably went haywire, Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deliberate Tampering' 
</P>
<P>
In its complaint, Primex accuses Pacific Bell of indulging in "illegal 
harassment" and "deliberate tampering" with the company's phone lines, most of 
which are attached to a Pacific Bell Centrex control unit. The goal, the 
complaint charges, is to destroy the company's business. Amin attached several 
pages of single-spaced entries chronicling scores of service irregularities and 
said he has many more on file. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn confirmed the existence of repeated 
complaints by Primex but said 2,400 tests have so far turned up no glitch in 
the phone company's equipment. Flynn said 99.8% of Pacific Bell's test calls 
went through without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for us at any time and at any case to disrupt a customer's 
business," she said. "That's just not the way we do business." 
</P>
<P>
But Amin disputed the validity of that finding. When he asked Pacific Bell last 
month to monitor one day's phone traffic for his firm, he said, the utility 
found that 41% of the calls lasted less than 15 seconds -- too brief, he said, 
to be completed business calls.

Korean Real Estate Restrictions Eased: The government of South Korea issued new 
guidelines that partially remove restrictions on foreign real estate purchases. 
Individuals may now buy hotels, motels, gas stations, supermarkets, golf 
courses, health clubs, bowling alleys and farms or other agricultural 
properties. However, they are prohibited from investing in "luxurious" 
properties such as condominiums and apartments. Individuals and companies must 
report all transactions to the Bank of Korea, which must approve any deal over 
$2 million.

T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell in 
Monday's auction to the lowest levels since last fall. The Treasury Department 
sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.65%, 
down from 8.09% last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 7.35%, down from 7.73% last week. The rates were 
the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.54% last Nov. 7 and six-month 
bills averaged 7.34 % on Sept. 19, 1988. The discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors -- 7.91% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,806.60 and 7.74% for a six-month bill selling for $9,628.40.

SEVERAL MAJOR BANKS JOIN IN CUTTING PRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several major commercial banks, including the nation's largest, lowered their 
prime lending rates a half percentage point Monday to 10.5%, signaling lower 
borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
First Bank of Chicago was the first to take the step shortly before the opening 
of the stock market, with Chemical Bank, Continental Bank, Morgan Guaranty 
Trust Co., Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co. and No. 1 
Citibank joining in. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction, effective immediately, follows similar cuts by San 
Francisco-based Bank of America on Friday and Chase Manhattan Bank more than 
three weeks ago. A few other smaller banks have reduced their prime rates since 
Chase's move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looser Credit Policies 
</P>
<P>
The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest 
it pays on savings accounts or certificates of deposit, and trails more subtle 
increases in other interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for calculating 
loans to businesses and for determining many types of fixed- and 
adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage rates are not included in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's decrease was widely expected by most economists due to continuing 
signs that the Federal Reserve is seeking looser credit policies in response to 
a slowdown in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Economists have speculated that major banks did not immediately follow Chase, 
which cut its prime rate on July 10, partly because they wanted to determine 
whether the Fed would keep pursuing lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentiment in the marketplace was that Chase was too early and everyone 
else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayed below 9%," said Elizabeth 
G. Reiners, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

The prime stood at 10.5% at the start of 1989. It was raised twice in February 
to 11.5%, then lowered a half percentage point on June 5. Those movements 
reflected changing concerns about economic growth and inflation.

<P>
The stock market climbed to new post-crash highs Monday, propelled by 
computer-program buying and falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials jumped 25.42 points to 2,660.66, its 
highest close since it stood at 2,662.95 on Aug. 31, 1987. Several other, broad 
market indicators surpassed record highs they reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow finished July with a net gain of 220.60 points for its strongest 
monthly performance since it soared 252.09 points in January of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the day's gains came in two rounds of buying ascribed to activity by 
professionals engaged in computer-program strategies involving stocks and 
stock-index futures and options. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,054 up, 490 down and 462 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 166.65 million shares, down from 
180.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in 
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and 
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 199.86 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola picked up 4 1/2 to 68 on word that investor Warren E. Buffett, who 
holds a 6.75% stake in the company, is seeking clearance to buy as much as 15% 
of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. rose 1/2 to 24 3/8. The company reported second-quarter earnings 
of $1.46 a share, up from $1.45 in the like period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere among the blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained 1/2 
to 40 5/8, International Business Machines rose 1 5/8 to 115, Philip Morris 
jumped 3 1/2 to 158 1/2 and General Electric advanced 1 to 58 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index bounced back from Friday's losses and 
closed at a record high Monday. The 225-issue Nikkei stock average gained 
248.24 points, or 0.72%, closing at 34,953.87. It had declined by 79.65 points 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior dealer at Nikko Securities, said the index climbed 
on the yen's sharp rise against the dollar and expectations of lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks were strong as well. J. P. Morgan rose 1 1/4 to 41 1/8; BankAmerica 
1 1/4 to 32; Manufacturers Hanover 1 3/8 to 43 3/8; Bankers Trust New York 1 
7/8 to 55 1/4, and NCNB 1/2 to 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Large blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 3,393 compared 
to 3,846. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 2.03 to 
192.41. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.37 to 395.68, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was up 3.93 at 346.08. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 1.02 to 
453.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at 
376.56, up 2.05. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices headed higher and interest rates declined amid buying inspired by 
widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will pursue a more generous 
credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's 30-year bond -- the credit market's benchmark bond -- added 1/2 
point, or $5 for every $1,000 in face value after gaining nearly the same 
amount on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The key bond's yield fell to 7.95% from 7.99% late Friday, marking the first 
time the long-term bond's yield has closed below 8% since the spring of 1987. 
The yield goes down when the bond's price rises. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 8 7/8%, down from 8 15/16% late Friday. The Fed controls the rate by adding 
or subtracting banking reserves, and many economists believe that the Fed has 
set a new target of 9%, down from 9 1/4%. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
Lower U.S. interest rates sapped strength Monday from the dollar, which fell to 
springtime levels against major foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in interest rates has wiped out the dollar rally that reached its peak 
in June, taking the dollar back to levels of May against the British pound and 
Japanese yen, April against the West German mark and March against the Swiss 
franc. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's sharpest drop came against the yen, which has surged ahead 
following the brief decline that occurred in the July political upheaval. 
Traders said there was optimism that Japan's governing partner would select a 
new prime minister shortly. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.6665 to buy 
one pound, more expensive than $1.6455 late Friday. In New York, the pound rose 
to $1.6655 from $1.6527 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.40 yen, down 1.05 yen from last Friday's 
close of 139.45 yen. After opening at 138.90 yen, the dollar ranged between 
138.15 yen and 139.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents an ounce to close at $369.64. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $368.25 from $369.20 on Friday. In Zurich, 
Switzerland, gold fell to $368.25 from $369.75. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Coffee and soybean prices fell sharply Monday, with coffee sinking to 
eight-year lows in New York and soybeans traded in Chicago settling at contract 
lows for most delivery months. 
</P>
<P>
CSCE spot September coffee fell 3.03 cents to close at 78.99 cents per pound, 
and one broker said prices could fall another 5 cents before rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CBOT soybeans futures sank under wave after wave of selling 
following widespread rains over the weekend in key crop areas. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to market pressure was the growing concern that lower-priced Brazilian 
soybeans might pull demand from the U.S. market, floor sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Contract lows were set in all but the lightly traded November, 1990, delivery. 
Spot August soybeans settled at $6.245 a bushel, off 24.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures posted gains as tropical storm Chantal neared the Gulf Coast. 
Reports that an American hostage was slain in Lebanon also fueled buying in 
energy futures.

MCCAW BID TOO LOW, LIN SAYS; MULLS OPTIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lin Broadcasting, declaring that McCaw Cellular Communications failed to meet a 
Monday deadline for reaching a friendly merger agreement, said Monday that it 
intends to pursue alternatives to the McCaw proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Lin has given McCaw every reasonable opportunity to enter into a merger 
agreement" at the price of $6.1 billion, or $127.50 a share, Lin Chairman and 
Chief Executive Donald A. Pels said in a prepared statement. "McCaw's 
continuing inadequate $110-a-share tender offer is clearly not in the best 
interest of Lin stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
Lin, the New York-based cellular telephone and broadcasting concern that holds 
a 35% stake in Los Angeles Cellular Telephone, has said it is considering 
spinning off its seven television stations into a separate company or a 
financial restructuring that may include a special dividend to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw on Monday insisted that its $110-a-share offer is "full and fair." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw, the nation's largest independent cellular 
telephone company, has been actively pursuing Lin since early June when it made 
a $120-a-share, or $5.8-billion, bid for the 90% of Lin it doesn't own. Lin's 
board rejected that offer. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw later agreed to discuss a $127.50 cash-and-stock offer but abruptly 
suspended talks July 21.

WANG REPORTS $375-MILLION LOSS, SUSPENDS DIVIDENDS 
</P>

<P>
Wang Laboratories Inc. on Monday reported a $375-million fourth-quarter loss, 
announced suspension of dividends and said it had fallen into violation of a 
bank lending agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the computer company was in such weakened condition that it would 
ordinarily be sold, except that the Wang family controls 80% of the stock 
voting rights. In addition, the company is still burdened with lines of 
business that are not attractive to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the loss stemmed from a $237-million pretax charge to cover the cost of 
a restructuring that involved closing factories, cutting jobs and lowering the 
book value of outdated assets. 
</P>
<P>
But the computer company also lost money on its ongoing operations. 
</P>
<P>
"A third of (the loss) is current operations, and clearly they have to reduce 
their expense structure further," said John W. Adams, chairman of Adams, 
Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston. "I'm sure they're aware of it. The computer 
business has just gotten to be more and more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The latest bad news pushed Wang's stock down to $6.125, down 25 cents a share, 
on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Wang stock has lost more than 80% of its value since early 1984, when it traded 
above $35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks New Terms 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing crisis for Wang is that the loss in its fourth fiscal quarter 
reduced its net worth below the level required by its commercial banks under a 
$300-million revolving credit agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Wang said it had received waivers from the banks through Aug. 10 and was 
continuing to negotiate new terms that would give it some breathing room. The 
company said it had hired Lodestar Group and Salomon Bros. as financial 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1951, Wang ranks 145th on Fortune magazine's list of the 500 largest 
American industrial companies, but in recent years the computer maker has shown 
a pronounced limp. 
</P>
<P>
After building a reputation on office word processors in the 1970s, officials 
have watched sales slowly eroded by the powerful personal computers and 
workstations that have taken their place. Its minicomputer business has 
likewise faltered. 
</P>
<P>
Wang is trying to make a comeback by focusing on four types of customers: 
financial services, government, manufacturing and professional services. Its 
most promising asset is Freestyle, a way of interacting with a personal 
computer by using an electronic pencil instead of a keyboard or "mouse." 
</P>
<P>
For the quarter ended June 30, the net loss was $374.7 million on revenue of 
$783.7 million, contrasted with earnings of $13.4 million on $822.8 million in 
revenue for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported a net loss of $424.3 million for all of it its 1989 fiscal 
year, contrasted with net income of $92.7 million on revenue of $3.07 billion 
in 1988.

CHRYSLER NET UP DESPITE 20% RISE IN INCENTIVE COSTS

Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 U.S. auto maker, Monday reported a higher profit for 
the second quarter despite a 20% increase in the cost of incentives aimed at 
enticing buyers. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts, citing soft industrywide sales and the heavy incentive 
programs, said they were pessimistic about the company's outlook for the rest 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said it earned $341 million, or $1.46 a share, up from $320 million, 
or $1.45 a share, in last year's second quarter. Sales climbed to $10.11 
billion from $9.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler was the only U.S. auto maker to post a year-over-year improvement. 
General Motors Corp. on Thursday said net income fell 3% to $1.45 billion while 
Ford Motor Co.'s earnings fell 16% to $1.40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Sales Drop 
</P>
<P>
Although Chrysler's performance came in on target, several analysts cut their 
forecasts of 1989 and 1990 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler last week announced a $1-billion cost-cutting program, including 
layoffs of 2,300 white-collar employees. The auto maker has said it expects 
industry car and truck sales this year of 14.8 million, down 6% from 1988, and 
thinks that sales will drop next year to 14.2 million.

JAPAN PARTY CAUCUS TO PICK NEW LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SEEKING APPLICANTS TO SUCCEED UNO

<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Monday decided to receive applications 
from candidates for the party presidency on Saturday and then hold a caucus 
Aug. 8 to choose a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Sosuke Uno. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Liberal Democrats' presidential election management 
committee marks the first time since former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone 
was chosen in 1982 that the party has committed itself to pick a new leader in 
an open election, rather than through back-room machinations. It is expected to 
be formalized today by the party's executive board. 
</P>
<P>
It came as Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had been touted as a potential "youth 
candidate" to lead the beleaguered party into a crucial lower-house election, 
declared himself out of the running after being informed that the party's 
biggest faction has decided to refrain from fielding any of its members, 
including Hashimoto, as candidates to succeed Uno. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
Ichiro Ozawa, the faction's secretary, said faction leaders had decided to stay 
out of the presidential race by way of assuming responsibility for the Liberal 
Democrats' defeat in an upper-house election July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who heads the faction, 
shares the blame with Uno, his surprise successor, for the upper-house debacle. 
Takeshita resigned in May after the yearlong Recruit influence-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Already reeling from a voter rebellion over the scandal and a broken promise by 
the ruling party not to impose a consumption tax, Liberal Democrat fortunes 
encountered new problems when a weekly magazine revealed three days after Uno 
took office that the new prime minister had purchased sexual favors from a 
geisha in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the election last month, the Liberal Democrats lost nearly a fourth of their 
holdings in the House of Councillors, falling 17 seats short of a majority. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat marked the first time in the party's 34-year history that it had 
lost control of either house of Parliament and raised the specter of a 
thrashing in an election for the lower house, which elects the prime minister. 
That ballot must be held by next July but is expected much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the real reason behind the Takeshita faction's move 
Monday was a fear that the faction might split up. In addition to Hashimoto, 
the party's 52-year-old secretary general, two other Takeshita followers had 
been mentioned as possible successors to Uno. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita lieutenants gave no indication of whom they might back. Speculation 
swung toward either Toshio Komoto, 78, the leader of the party's smallest 
faction, or Toshiki Kaifu, 58, a Komoto lieutenant who has served twice as 
education minister. 
</P>
<P>
No one has yet declared his candidacy, however, and a host of names are still 
being bandied about. 
</P>
<P>
The party's presidential election commission said applications will be accepted 
for one hour Saturday morning from candidates who receive the endorsement of at 
least 20 of the party's members of both houses of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates would then be asked to present their policies both in a Saturday 
afternoon news conference and in a speech before a caucus is convened next 
Tuesday to elect one of them. 
</P>
<P>
If only one candidate files for the contest, that leader will become the party 
president and the next prime minister -- Japan's third in three months -- by 
virtue of the Liberal Democrats' control of the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
Uno's Cabinet officially decided today to convene a six-day special session of 
Parliament next Monday to elect both officials of the upper house and conduct a 
ballot for the new prime minister. Although both houses cast ballots for the 
prime minister, the decision by the lower house is final.

An estimated 8,000 grocery clerks and meat cutters agreed to end an 81-day 
strike that forced Puget Sound supermarkets to cut back their hours. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Food and Commercial Workers union, who had walked out May 11, 
voted Sunday night to accept a three-year contract that provides raises and 
continues Sunday premium pay, which employers had sought to cut, said union

The governors of seven states have agreed to cooperate in developing programs 
to combat drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle Atlantic Governors' Compact on Drug and Alcohol Abuse was signed 
Sunday in a ceremony during the National Governors' Assn. Conference by the 
governors of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West 
Virginia. Earlier, it had been signed by New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
The pact commits the states to a comprehensive regional project of 
information-sharing and training, developing a coordinated approach to drug 
abuse problems and methods in prevention and early intervention. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the participating governors said that later this week, District 
of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry also is expected to join the pact.

FIRES BLACKEN 70,000 ACRES IN 4 STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Wire Service Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
Blazes whipped by hot dry winds have destroyed 70,000 acres of forest and 
brushland in four western states and are still raging out of control in many 
areas, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they had nearly contained one of the worst of the fires, an 
11,700-acre blaze about 45 miles northeast of Fresno in the central Sierra 
Nevada foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said an arsonist lit the fire that has burned out of control for 
three days. It has destroyed seven houses, forcing some 2,500 people out of 
their homes over the weekend and filling the area around the community of 
Auberry with thick smoke. 
</P>
<P>
A 5,700-acre wildfire in the Cleveland National Forest was also continued to 
burn out of control Monday in a remote area of San Diego County. About 900 
firefighters saved 13 homes and structures in the Cleveland National Forest 
blaze Sunday, said a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman, but a house and a trailer 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
A 1,200-acre brush fire in the Sand Canyon area of the Santa Clarita Valley was 
brought under control Monday. The blaze, about 30 miles northwest of Los 
Angeles, had earlier forced the evacuation of 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters also mopped up a stubborn 10,500-acre wildfire that had burned 
since late last week near Atascadero in central California, and officials said 
it was expected to be controlled late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning strikes ignited several hundred fires in Idaho, where nearly 4,000 
personnel were battling blazes that have blackened more than 40,000 acres. Two 
dozen buildings, including a popular resort lodge, were destroyed in the south 
central Idaho community of Lowman. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern Oregon, a 17,000-acre fire overran a state highway, forcing 
officials to close it to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 people already have been assigned to firefighting duty in 
California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Soldiers were called out from Fort 
Lewis, Wash. to help firefighters who were already backed up by National 
Guardsmen in Oregon and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials said fire danger is extremely high in the region because 
much of it is suffering from a third consecutive year of drought.

CITY, COUNTY AGREE ON PLAN TO BUILD JAIL, ADD 9 COURTROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city and county officials Monday announced a 10-point plan to address 
the region's jail crisis, committing two historically uncooperative governments 
to work together on construction of a 2,700-bed pre-arraignment jail and the 
addition of nine courtrooms downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, the city would offer land for jail sites and $3 
million in redevelopment money to pay for courtroom construction. In return, 
the county would spend $33 million in state funds on construction of the first 
phase of the pre-arraignment jail and agree not to move any of the Superior 
Courts out of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beginning of Cooperation' 
</P>
<P>
If approved at a joint meeting of the San Diego City Council and the county 
Board of Supervisors Thursday, the "memorandum of understanding" would for the 
first time make large amounts of city land and money available to the county 
for construction of jails and courtrooms -- a responsibility that city 
officials have historically asserted is the county's alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous beginning of cooperation between the two legislative bodies 
that represent the same constituents," said Presiding Superior Court Judge 
Michael I. Greer, who just two weeks ago predicted dire consequences from the 
city's decision to add 116 police officers to its force without a corresponding 
increase in jail space. "It requires this kind of cooperation in order to 
create a solution." 
</P>
<P>
"The days of saying, 'It's not our problem, it's somebody else's problem' are 
over with," said Supervisor Brian Bilbray, a member of the committee that 
negotiated the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Endorses Basic Pact 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who two weeks ago rebuffed calls from Greer and other 
law enforcement officials for city assistance in building jails, endorsed the 
basic agreement but withheld comment on specifics until she has an opportunity 
to review them, said her spokesman, Paul Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, it is expected to take three years to build the 500-bed 
first phase of the pre-arraignment jail. Until then, the jail crowding that 
forces police to cite and release more than 100 misdemeanor arrestees every day 
will continue, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 24, county jails held 5,160 inmates, more than double their official 
capacity of 2,039, making them the most crowded jails in the nation for the 
second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that we have done or can do that will give immediate relief 
to the tremendous problem that's before us," said Supervisor George Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, officials are looking to the completion of the Vista jail for 
some help. Bookings into the jail, which has been enlarged from 246 to 545 
beds, should begin next month. The jail's capacity will be further increased 
when double-bunking of inmates begins almost immediately, said Rich Robinson, 
director of the county's office of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also announced that they will support legislation aimed at allowing 
double-bunking in jails built with state money, such as the 1,040-bed East Mesa 
facility scheduled to open in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, Bilbray and San Diego City Council members Ed Struiksma and Gloria 
McColl were appointed in May to the committee that negotiated the tentative 
agreement and announced it at a news conference Monday. Also represented were 
the Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency, which oversees spending of 
sales tax revenue earmarked for jails, and the city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the agreement call for the city to lease land to the county at a 
"nominal" sum for the proposed new pre-arraignment jail, which is projected to 
hold 2,700 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Struiksma said 40 acres north of California 52, east of 
Convoy Street, and a larger parcel on the grounds of Miramar Naval Air Station, 
west of Jackson Drive, are two city-owned plots under consideration as jail 
sites. The former is the site once envisioned for the proposed SANDER 
trash-to-energy plant, and the latter is envisioned as the home of the Police 
Department's academy and pistol range. Both areas are within the city. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma stressed, however, that other parcels, both publicly and privately 
owned, are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
If county lawyers win a court battle to uphold the legality of a half-cent 
sales tax earmarked for jail construction, some of the $1.6 billion in revenue 
from the tax will be spent to buy the land from the city at fair market value 
within 12 months of a final judgment in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a Superior Court judge struck down the tax as a violation of 
Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative that cut property taxes. The supervisors 
are appealing. 
</P>
<P>
If the county loses the legal battle, and another major source of funds becomes 
available, that money would be used to buy the land, according the terms of the 
agreement. In similarly vague language, the city would agree to spend any major 
new revenue it discovers to help the county finance, build and operate jails 
and courts within city limits. Distribution of fines and booking charges 
between the city and county would remain the same if new money is found. 
</P>
<P>
Even without new funding, the agreement commits the county to spend $33 million 
in revenue that it will receive from the state in September to build the first 
phase of the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Planning and construction of that facility, including preparation of an 
environmental impact report and possible mitigation of any environmental 
damage, could take three years, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment arm would make available $3 million already budgeted 
for construction of nine new courtrooms downtown. County officials are 
negotiating with owners of the former El Cortez Hotel on Ash Street and the 
Walker Scott building on Broadway for space for the courtrooms, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Keep Court Downtown 
</P>
<P>
In return, the county would agree to keep the court system downtown and 
maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had to move the courts out of downtown, it would decimate revitalization 
efforts," Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also resurrects a city plan to hire a private company to build 
and operate a 200-bed pre-arraignment jail. Although that jail could be built 
more quickly, perhaps in less than a year, it depends on receipt of $12 million 
from the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, the county would endorse the concept, giving the 
city added support in its quest for the money. 
</P>
<P>
The $12 million was part of a request for $34 million in emergency assistance 
shot down by Gov. George Deukmejian during this year's budget deliberations. 
His staff suggested that the declaration of emergency by O'Connor and the 
council was "a publicity stunt." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Tennyson, director of the city's Inter-Governmental Relations 
Department, said some legislators expressed interest in the concept during 
recent deliberations, but she would not predict the chances of passage next 
year.

SLAYING, TOURBOOK LINK REJECTED;

APPEAL COURT DENIES WIDOW'S CLAIM AGAINST AUTO CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widow of a lawyer killed in a San Diego motel parking lot is not due 
damages from the Automobile Club of Southern California just because the club 
listed the motel in its popular TourBook, a state appeal court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego rejected the novel claim by 
Barbara K. Yanase, saying the club did not have to investigate neighborhood 
safety when listing and rating hotels and motels in the guides. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a good idea, but you never know," her lawyer, Paul L. Tepper 
of Van Nuys, said Monday. "They're pretty conservative down there. 
</P>
<P>
"Had I proposed this eight years before, I never would have been thrown out," 
Tepper said. "Now you're getting thrown out on darndest things, all because the 
court system has shifted away from victims' rights." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica lawyer Fritz B. Hax, who represented the club, said Monday that 
the court's decision was just common sense. 
</P>
<P>
"How can somebody protect against the criminal act of a third person?" Hax 
said. "How on earth is the auto club going to protect against a mugger on 
somebody else's property? It was just a wild theory against the club, and I am 
pleased the court doesn't make the auto club insure the safety of everybody who 
reads their TourBook." 
</P>
<P>
About 2.9 million copies of the California and Nevada TourBook were distributed 
nationally last year, Clarence M. Garlough, the auto club's manager of approved 
accommodations, said Monday in a phone call from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Different parts of the country have their own directories, Garlough said. The 
books list and rate hotels and motels and are given free to members of the 
American Automobile Assn., with which the auto club is affiliated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose from the Jan. 25, 1984, slaying of George A. Yanase, 52, of 
Hacienda Heights, an attorney for the state Department of Corporations. The 
supervising counsel of all Los Angeles attorneys in the department's 
enforcement section, 
</P>
<P>
Yanase arrived in San Diego to attend a three-day conference at the Hotel del 
Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Yanase registered at what was then called the Royal Lodge motel at 833 Ash St. 
in downtown San Diego. He was staying there because his daily expense allotment 
from the state, about $60, was not enough to pay for a room at the Hotel Del, 
which started at about $100 for the convention, Tepper said. 
</P>
<P>
After attending the first day of the conference, Yanase returned about 10 p.m. 
to the motel. As he got out of his car in the adjoining parking lot, he was 
shot in the head in an attempted robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever been arrested in the killing, Tepper said. 
</P>
<P>
Yanase had picked the motel because he read about it in the 1983 California and 
Nevada TourBook. Because Yanase relied on the book, and since he was a paid-up 
member of the auto club, they had a "special relationship," Tepper contended. 
That relationship meant that the club owed him the duty of finding out and 
telling him in the book if the area around a motel was unsafe, the lawyer 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Vincent P. Di Figlia rejected that claim. In an 
opinion filed July 21, the 4th District Court of Appeal did, too. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the TourBook, as the guides themselves say, is to provide 
information about "accommodations," which the dictionary defined as food and 
lodging, Justice William L. Todd Jr. said for the court. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the "special relationship, if it exists at all," was limited to 
listing and rating "accommodations," not detailing neighborhood safety, Todd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1985 case, a state Court of Appeal ruled that a travel agent who arranges 
vacation plans must tell a client about "reasonably obtainable" information 
that might make a difference to the customer, Todd noted. But that case did not 
apply, since the auto club did not arrange Yanase's plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their argument is really spurious about the book because the book 
really spurs people on" to think that the club's field representatives have 
looked at a lodging "for all reasons, much the same as a travel agent would 
do," Tepper said. "I don't see much distinction between the travel agent 
analogy and publishing it in a book as a good accommodation." 
</P>
<P>
Todd's final point was that the lists and ratings in the book are like an 
advertisement, and the court was "loath" to create new cases based on 
"negligently failing to investigate the safety of an advertised product." 
</P>
<P>
Justices Patricia D. Benke and Charles W. Froehlich Jr. concurred in Todd's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"They completely ignored what was a very good argument on the theory they would 
be extending the law," Tepper said. "I think that's wrong. I don't think that 
(an appellate court) necessarily has to be an activist court, but it doesn't 
have to be a regressive court. And I think this court was being regressive." 
</P>
<P>
Tepper said he does not plan to appeal. He said he settled separate claims 
against the motel itself for $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The automobile club was not a party to the suit.

STATE TO BEGIN CHATHAM TOXICS CLEANUP IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chatham Bros. Barrel Yard, Escondido's infamous toxic waste dump, will be 
cleaned up by the state starting in mid-February, a state official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kearns, local chief of the state Toxic Waste Substance Control Agency, 
announced that he had "a commitment from Sacramento" for an additional $200,000 
needed to remove the buried toxic sludge and about 150 barrels of waste from 
the former industrial solvents dump in southwestern Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns told an Escondido advisory board that the funds will be available in 
time to allow for the cleanup to proceed on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,500 Cubic Yards 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 cubic yards of buried waste -- containing PCBs, lead, heavy metals 
and other carcinogens -- has been found in a 19-by-60-foot area of the former 
disposal site. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of preparations and promises, the state toxic substances 
agency completed a preliminary study of ground-water pollution in and around 
the site in July. 
</P>
<P>
The test wells showed that only acetones had migrated into the ground water 
outside the site, and state officials declared that the presence of the 
industrial solvent was not a hazard to local residents or water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But the report also showed that toxic wastes on the site were much more 
abundant than earlier thought, amounting to about 1,500 cubic yards of sludge 
that must be trucked to an approved disposal area. 
</P>
<P>
State officials had budgeted $260,000 for removal of 400 cubic yards of toxics; 
they estimated that about $425,000 would be needed to accomplish the larger 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
State toxic waste cleanup coffers are empty, with no funds available to augment 
the Chatham cleanup, but a bill now awaiting Gov. George Deukmejian's signature 
would replenish the fund from assessments placed on the state's major 
toxic-waste producers. If Deukmejian does not sign the bill (SB 475) by 
Wednesday, it dies. But a spokeswoman for state Sen. Bill Craven (R-Oceanside) 
said the legislator had been assured that the governor will approve the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns said last week that he would oppose a cleanup that did not remove all 
toxic sludge from the site, a former industrial waste disposal yard that 
operated from 1941 until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marxen, spokesman for the state toxic waste agency, said that if 
carcinogenic materials had been found to have migrated off the Chatham site, 
the cleanup could have been speeded up by deleting public hearings and 
community education programs, which are not required if no immediate danger is 
found. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the rural residential area around the dump site has 
experienced a housing boom, with about 100 new homes built around the property. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido city officials, concerned about the effect of the toxic dump on 
surrounding residents, earlier this year considered imposing a building 
moratorium around the site. The action was delayed until studies could be 
completed to determine the extent of off-site pollution.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY KISSED EX-CLIENT, COURT TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson was seen at least twice in public 
kissing and hugging a woman who is suing him for legal malpractice, a friend of 
the plaintiff testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson, 61, who introduced the term "palimony" to jurisprudence, testified 
earlier in the day at his Los Angeles Superior Court trial that he could not 
recall meeting the witness, Cheryl Christiansen. Christiansen testified on 
behalf of her friend, Felicia Gordon, who is suing Mitchelson, accusing him of 
bungling her multimillion-dollar divorce from businessman Robert MacDonald in 
1982 and of taking advantage of her emotional and financial distress to 
pressure her into having sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen testified that at a 1983 birthday party for Gordon in Beverly 
Hills, she saw Mitchelson grab Gordon and pull her down next to him on a sofa. 
"At the party," Christiansen said, "he was kissing her on a number of occasions 
and he had his arm around her waist."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former probation officer at Juvenile Hall was ordered Monday to stand trial 
on charges of molesting 10 girls he had contact with while they were 
incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Denny, 48, of San Diego, was bound over to Superior Court after a 
daylong preliminary hearing conducted by San Diego Municipal Judge Nicholas 
Kasimatis. Denny is charged with six felony sex charges and 14 misdemeanor 
counts of unlawfully touching the girls, all minors. 
</P>
<P>
The judge dismissed some counts when some of the witnesses failed to show up or 
the prosecution did not present evidence on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
Denny, who is free on $10,000 bail, will next appear in court Aug. 14, when a 
trial date will be set. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the teen-age girls told of inappropriate sexual comments or touching 
incidents by Denny while they were in custody at Juvenile Hall. The victims 
were then all 15 to 17 years old. Denny was charged with the offenses in May.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man was killed early Monday when he was struck by two cars as 
he attempted to dash across a freeway near San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino man carried no identification and was in his 20s, according to 
Deputy Coroner Joe Cogen. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was running across the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 near Dairy 
Mart Road about 12:45 a.m., a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman said. A car 
struck the man, tossing him over the vehicle. When he landed in the roadway, a 
second car dragged him about 150 feet, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was dead at the scene, Cogen said. The man was wearing jogging 
pants, blue deck shoes, and a red, long-sleeved sweat shirt.

MALL DEVELOPER ASSAILS LATEST CARWASH TACTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a proposed Studio City mini-mall Monday denounced the latest 
efforts by a Los Angeles city councilman and residents to force him to delay or 
alter his project so a popular carwash, gas station and restaurant would be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Smedra called the tactics harassment by a small contingent of residents who 
don't want him to demolish the three businesses on the northeast corner of 
Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the residents group, Save Our Corner, unsuccessfully tried to have 
the 28-year-old carwash and the adjoining gas station and restaurant declared 
cultural monuments. The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission refused to 
award the designation, clearing the way for Smedra to remove the three 
structures within 90 days and build the mall. 
</P>
<P>
But City Councilman Joel Wachs introduced a motion last week to force Smedra to 
prepare an environmental impact report on the proposed $15-million mall 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Smedra said he especially was angered by Wachs' action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really unfortunate that this is happening," Smedra said. "And it's only a 
small group of homeowners who are doing this. There are a lot of people in that 
area who have said they want me to get rid of that atrocity and build something 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs today is expected to ask the full council to order Smedra to do the 
report. He has said the mall would have a substantial impact on traffic and 
would harm the aesthetics of the area. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council approves Wachs' request, the project could be delayed for 
six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Handelman, a spokesman for the developer, said Smedra had already evaluated 
the impact of the project. "We have already taken care of all the concerns," he 
said, adding that Smedra had completed reports on traffic and other 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"This is nothing other than a delay tactic that will cost Mr. Smedra a lot of 
money," he said. "It's unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
While commending Wachs on his efforts to save the carwash, the residents' group 
Monday called for the city to purchase the corner and build a parking lot for 
businesses along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need another shopping center; we need parking," said resident Jack 
McGrath as he and several members of the group stood beside the carwash. He 
said the city should pay for the parking lot out of funds collected from 
parking meters in Studio City. The lot would cost an estimated $8.3 million, 
McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting since 1958 for something to be done with this money," 
McGrath said. "And we've gotten nothing back for our nickels, dimes and 
quarters." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the group, Walter McIntyre, said 70 out 250 retail businesses 
that have been built between Fulton and Vineland avenues are vacant. "This 
center would just add to the glut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group said the lot could be financed by raising the meter rate from 25 
cents to 50 cents an hour and by extending the hours of meter operation by four 
hours.

GROUP CIRCULATES RECALL PETITIONS AGAINST BERNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of a fledgling recall drive against Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson began circulating petitions last weekend in their attempt to gather 
more than 17,000 signatures from registered voters in the 12th Council 
District. 
</P>
<P>
A Northridge businessman angry over a redevelopment proposal that would affect 
his property holdings initiated the drive. Walter N. Prince and his supporters, 
who he says number more than 100, have until Nov. 20 to gather the signatures 
of 15% of the registered voters in the district. 
</P>
<P>
If the signatures are validated by the Los Angeles City Clerk, Bernson would be 
forced into a recall election. Prince said volunteers of the group called CURB, 
for Citizens Unite to Recall Bernson, are displeased with the councilman's 
order to study placing a Northridge industrial area near Parthenia Street and 
Tampa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In a rebuttal published as part of the petition, Bernson called the drive a 
"mean-spirited" effort by special interests in favor of mini-mall developments 
and adult bookstores. The rebuttal was co-signed by Los Angeles Police Chief 
Daryl Gates, local clergy and homeowner leaders.

SIMI POLICE CONTRACT RATIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council on Monday night ratified a four-year contract that 
would raise the base salary of a police officer 7.5% in the first year, from 
$26,472 to $28,457. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, effective Aug. 14 through June 30, 1993, promises a salary 
survey in its last year of 12 police departments, and pledges to pay Simi 
police the average. It also agrees to a study by an independent consultant of 
alternative work schedules, including a workweek of four 10-hour days that had 
been demanded by the Simi Valley Police Officers Assn. The police union 
represents about 85 of the department's 100 officers. 
</P>
<P>
The contract creates a new position of senior police officer, to be paid $200 a 
month more than the base salary for a patrolman. A senior police officer would 
rank between a starting officer and a sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the union reached a settlement on the contract July 19 after an 
almost three-week deadlock.

JAPANESE-STYLE KARAOKE BARS PUT SINGING PATRONS IN SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN and ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businessman Mike Hara sat at the piano bar at the Suzuran Restaurant in 
Gardena, solemnly sipping a drink and taking an occasional drag from a 
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Hara leaned over and whispered into the ear of bar owner Kimi Ishida, 
then picked up a microphone lying in front of him. As images of Japan began to 
flicker on a video monitor over the bar, the gray-suited Hara, his back to his 
audience, crooned a plaintive song in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Hara's fellow patrons in the smoke-filled restaurant paid scant attention. 
</P>
<P>
But Hara didn't seem to mind. The 40-year-old Gardena resident comes to Suzuran 
at least once a week, not for an audience, but for karaoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the U.S. a long time, and sometimes I miss my country," said the 
native of Japan after concluding the song with a dramatic crescendo. "This 
reminds me of my country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taped Accompaniment 
</P>
<P>
In Japanese, karaoke means empty orchestra. The concept is simple: A host 
invites anyone with a little chutzpah to sing, with musical accompaniment 
provided on tape. Meanwhile, large video screens around the bar show the gutsy 
singers themselves or an MTV-style video, with the lyrics of the song displayed 
across the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters bill it as "the piano bar of the '80s." Most American-born patrons 
use it as the perfect bar-scene icebreaker, while many Japanese-born karaoke 
customers view it as a nostalgic reminder of home. 
</P>
<P>
Would-be stars get the chance to sing their favorite songs as a growing number 
of area nightclubs buy or lease the electronic sound and video systems that are 
used to accompany the novice singers. The equipment has created a new niche in 
the home audio/video market. 
</P>
<P>
In the South Bay, which has large numbers of businessmen who work in California 
for companies based in Japan, karaoke began appearing about five years ago. 
There are more than a dozen such clubs throughout the area, mostly in Torrance 
and Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, karaoke could be found in Southern California, but only in 
bars and restaurants that catered primarily to the Japanese. Today, some 
karaoke bars remain traditionally Japanese, but the clientele is becoming 
increasingly diverse as other South Bay residents discover karaoke, bar owners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yuppies Like It 
</P>
<P>
Karaoke is beginning to make a big splash with Los Angeles-area yuppies, its 
promoters say. An increasing number of night spots, such as Merlin McFly's in 
Santa Monica, Barwinkles in Long Beach and Mr. J's in Santa Ana are reserving 
one or two nights a week for people who like to sing in front of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
At Club Hara-Juku in Torrance, karaoke appeals to a multi-ethnic clientele 
because "most people like to sing," said manager Tony Tani. Karaoke contests on 
Wednesdays and open-microphone audience participation on weekend nights draw 
big crowds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimi Ishida, who owns Suzuran with her husband Tom, said that since they began 
offering karaoke five years ago, their clientele has broadened to include all 
kinds of karaoke fans, from business professionals to blue-collar workers. 
Several dozen customers have become regular "performers" at the club, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Barwinkles, Eliza Gurule was singing on a recent night. "I love to get in 
front of the crowds!" said the ebullient mother of two. "I feel like I'm on 
'Star Search.' " 
</P>
<P>
Karaoke "is really blossoming now," said Gene Settler, president of the 
L.A.-based Singing Machine Co., which he said was the first to begin 
manufacturing karaoke equipment in the United States in 1982. Settler said he 
distributes sets across the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Voice Optional 
</P>
<P>
A good voice is not a requirement for living out a rock 'n' roll fantasy. But 
being a bit of a ham helps. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun," said Suzuran regular Shanna Tanaka, slightly breathless after an 
enthusiastic rendition of "Johnny Angel." Tanaka, who often sings at the bar 
with her husband, Rodney, said she even takes singing lessons "because I don't 
want to embarrass people when I sing." 
</P>
<P>
Customers at Suzuran, a cozy, 40-seat restaurant on Redondo Beach Boulevard, 
said singing there is like performing for friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like everybody's listening, because everybody's drinking and 
having a good time," Tanaka shouted over the noise of about 30 patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment's burgeoning popularity in the United States has not gone 
unnoticed in Japan, where karaoke is a big hit in homes and bars. Recently, a 
Tokyo television crew did several stories on Japanese companies doing business 
in Southern California. It featured one company, Pioneer Laser Entertainment, a 
Pioneer Electronics division that opened last year to sell karaoke equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different in Japan 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Ikuko Kurokawa, who works for one of Japan's major TV networks, said 
in an interview that karaoke here is different than in Japan. In Japan, she 
said, karaoke bars are often geared toward businessmen who go to them after 
work to drink and "release stress and frustration." Here, both men and women 
enjoy karaoke. And the atmosphere here has more of a party feeling, she said. 
Local karaoke features everything from lullabies to rock. 
</P>
<P>
Settler said his company has sold more than 100,000 karaoke units for 
businesses and homes. They range in price from $49 for a dual cassette 
recorder, which can tape a singer on one side using prerecorded music from the 
second side, to a $6,000 model. "One set retails for $1,795 and the yuppies are 
buying that," Settler said. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer, which sells the systems using laser technology and ranging from $900 
to $3,000, has sold about 4,000 karaoke units in the past year, mostly in 
California and Hawaii, according to Jake Ramirez, assistant manager for 
Pioneer's Southwest region. 
</P>
<P>
The more economical units are being bought for home use, but the company's big 
push is to sell commercially, Ramirez said. Restaurants and bars are buying the 
equipment because "it's cheap entertainment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has a hidden desire to be a rock 'n' roll star," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Aspirations to stardom apply even to strait-laced businessmen in the South Bay, 
where there are more than a dozen karaoke clubs, mostly in Gardena and 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taxed as Entertainment 
</P>
<P>
"We started seeing it about five years ago and initially we were kind of naive 
as to what it was," said Gardena revenue supervisor Tony Vieira, who oversees 
the issuing of city business licenses and permits. "We had to make a 
determination whether it was entertainment or not." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena officials decided karaoke was entertainment, similar to that provided 
by amateur comedy clubs, and began charging an annual entertainment permit fee 
of $300 to karaoke bars, Vieira said. 
</P>
<P>
One karaoke enthusiast, Phillip Murachi of Torrance, works by day as an 
importer for a Japanese construction supply company, but by night habitually 
regales Suzuran clients with traditional Japanese songs remembered from his 
boyhood in Tokyo, in addition to Western tunes. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weeknight at Suzuran's, Murachi, 38, beamed as he listened to the 
scattered applause for his low-key rendition of "Love Me Tender." 
</P>
<P>
"The clapping hands -- that's very good," Murachi said. "It satisfies."

FOREIGN GROUP MAY BUY STAKE IN MARINA DEL REY LEASEHOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A secretive group of foreign investors, using a major Paris bank, a Luxembourg 
holding company, a Cayman Islands tax shelter and a series of California 
corporations, is buying into Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of the highly publicized foreign purchases of private Southern 
California real estate, this transaction involves investment in public land. 
The marina is owned by Los Angeles County, and businesses there operate on 
long-term leases approved by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although county officials who manage the marina do not know the identity, or 
even the nationality, of the investors, they have already given preliminary 
approval to the $21.8-million deal after an examination of details that did not 
extend beyond California. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors to Decide 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the County Board of Supervisors will be asked to ratify the 
complex deal, which would give the overseas investors a major stake in leases 
on three hotels, two apartment complexes, restaurants, tourist facilities, a 
shopping center, an office building and hundreds of boat slips at the marina. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors must approve any substantial change in the leases, including 
the partnerships that control them. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say there has been foreign investment in Marina del Rey 
before, but never on this scale. 
</P>
<P>
The marina's largest leaseholder, Abraham M. Lurie, is selling a 49.9% interest 
in leases on 10 marina properties to foreign investors for $21.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie, president and owner of Real Property Management, is a major real estate 
investor and contributor to political campaigns. He and his companies donated 
$27,350 to the campaigns of four of the five county supervisors from 1985 
through 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie said he does not know the identity and nationality of the foreign 
investors who are becoming general partners in his marina ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no way of knowing who the investors are now and if there is any change 
in investors I have no way of knowing that either," he said. "I assume the 
identity is not one particular nationality. It could be a number of them. They 
are not U.S. residents." 
</P>
<P>
The deal spans four countries -- the United States; the Cayman Islands, a 
cluster of Caribbean islands with tax laws favorable to overseas investors; 
Luxembourg, a small duchy in Europe with incorporation laws that require 
minimal disclosure; and France. It involves a group of new corporations, a 
holding company, a multinational bank -- Banque Indo Suez -- and investors who 
value their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"They could be Saudi Arabians. They could be French. They could be Swiss," 
Lurie said. "They could be anyone who is a customer who is checked by Banque 
Indo Suez. What they could not be is a U.S. resident." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 leases cover the Marina del Rey Hotel, the Marina Beach Hotel, the 
Marina International Hotel, the Islander Marina and Admiralty Apartments, the 
Marina Beach Shopping Center, Real Property Management's offices, Fisherman's 
Village and Pier 44. A total of 841 boat slips are included. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie said he intends to use the proceeds from the deal to pay off loans, make 
capital improvements and begin redeveloping some of the parcels involved in the 
transaction. He also is taking on new partners to build a nine-story, 300-room 
hotel, to be known as the Marina Plaza, on a long-vacant 3.7-acre site in the 
marina. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the Marina Plaza site and the 10 properties involved in the 
transaction represent 16% of Marina del Rey's land area and provided the county 
with $3.35 million in rental income last year. That was 20% of the marina's 
overall rental revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Approval Recommended 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy hearing, the county's Small Craft Harbor Commission, an 
advisory group, voted 3-1 earlier this month to recommend that the supervisors, 
at their Aug. 8 meeting, approve the changes in the lease partners. 
</P>
<P>
The lone dissenter, Century City attorney Herbert J. Strickstein, objected on 
grounds that the staff of the county's Department of Beaches and Harbors has 
not supplied enough information on whether Lurie will have to pay a transfer 
fee to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Strickstein said that he has been concerned about "foreign investors coming in 
and eventually owning the marina." 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the lease require the county to approve changes in the ownership 
of a leasehold if, in Strickstein's words, "a person is financially responsible 
and their credit is good." 
</P>
<P>
Strickstein acknowledged, however, that county officials do not know who the 
new investors are. 
</P>
<P>
"Under terms of the lease there is not a lot we can know," Strickstein said. "I 
don't know what country or where they come from." 
</P>
<P>
No Need to Know 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't feel a need to know that," said Eric Bourdon, assistant director 
of the Beaches and Harbors Department. 
</P>
<P>
County lease specialist Dennis Heitmann, who works for Bourdon, said he had 
limited his inquiries to the 10 new California corporations that were set up 
for the transaction. The new companies are all headed by the same person, 
Charles E. Wallace, and all share the same Century City office. 
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Small Craft Harbor Commission, Heitmann described Wallace 
as a certified public accountant "with a strong background in corporate finance 
and management." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, however, said that he is not a CPA. He said he has no investment of 
his own in any of the corporations and that he, too, does not know the identity 
or nationality of the foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
Scope Unknown 
</P>
<P>
"The $22 million is coming from the Banque Indo Suez and their clients," he 
said. "I honestly don't know the scope of the group." 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the new companies are acquiring varying percentage interests in Marina 
International Properties Ltd., the company headed by Lurie, which holds the 
marina leases. The 10th company is involved with the Marina Plaza hotel 
project. All 10 are owned by Marina Enterprises International Ltd., which is 
based in the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
The Cayman Islands corporation, in turn, is owned entirely by North American 
Real Estate Holding, which is based in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
And the money for the investments is being raised from customers of Banque Indo 
Suez, a large Paris-based multinational bank, whose name stems from its role in 
financing construction of the Suez Canal, which opened in 1869. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce Taxes 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the state Franchise Tax Board in Sacramento, who asked not to 
be identified, said the complex corporate structure will reduce taxes and 
protect the anonymity of the investors. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago attorney Cornelius J. Sullivan explained the structure to the Small 
Craft Harbor Commission at its July 12 meeting. He said it would allow profits 
from the sale of parts of the investment to be sent to the Cayman Islands 
without paying a 30% U.S. withholding tax. "That is perfectly legitimate, legal 
tax planning under our U.S. laws," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie said he has never met the actual investors and has negotiated only with 
Sullivan. He said the identity of the investors will be known by the Banque 
Indo Suez. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
S&amp;L BAILOUT BILL IS THE CULPRIT, LOAN OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sharp reduction in the development of new apartments will probably be the 
most immediate effect of the savings-and-loan bailout bill approaching passage 
in Congress. But the more lasting and broadly felt result could be to make 
mortgage loans and single-family houses more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
So say executives at Home Federal Savings and Great American Bank, two San 
Diego-based S&amp;Ls that are heavily involved in real estate development as 
well as lending, principally in San Diego County. The executives praised the 
$166-billion S&amp;L rescue bill as long overdue but warned that its 
consequences would generally not be happy ones for housing consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Both Roger Lindland, president of Great American Bank, and Jack Roach, chief 
operating officer of Home Federal's development arm, said they will cut their 
apartment lending activities because new risk-based capital requirements in the 
bailout bill will make the loans less profitable. And they expect others in the 
industry to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer new apartment projects, in a market such as San Diego where an 
ever-increasing population is finding housing increasingly unaffordable, 
translates into a higher demand-supply imbalance and therefore higher rents 
"down the road," Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, both executives predicted in interviews that the bill's disincentives 
for S&amp;L development activities will eventually cut the supply of housing 
and mortgage money, reductions that will increase housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, housing finance will become more scarce once the S&amp;L 
shakeout is complete, simply because the consolidation of the S&amp;L industry 
will leave fewer loan sources for consumers and less competition, Lindland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the $166-billion bailout bill has not yet been passed into law, 
observers expect the version hammered out by House and Senate negotiators last 
week to stay largely intact. That version imposes strict new capital 
requirements that force S&amp;Ls to have much more cash equity on hand to 
cushion the government from liability for riskier loans. 
</P>
<P>
The new bill also assigns tougher capital requirements for certain kinds of 
loans. For example, the new bill classifies apartment loans in the riskier 
commercial loan category, which means lenders will have to keep as much cash 
equity set aside -- up to $8 for each $100 loaned -- as it would for an office 
or retail building. 
</P>
<P>
The new provision dims the appeal of apartment lending considerably, Roach 
said, because the higher capital requirement will reduce the S&amp;L's rate of 
return. In the past, S&amp;Ls could make apartment loans as long as the S&amp;L 
had the regulatory minimum of 3% equity as a percentage of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the S&amp;Ls choose to set aside the added capital for apartment loans, 
they will be more restricted in how much of their loan portfolios are devoted 
to apartment loans. In the past, apartment loans were lumped together in the 
home mortgage loan category, which under old rules could constitute up to 60% 
of an S&amp;L's loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, S&amp;Ls could make up to 60% of their loans to apartment developers 
as long they met the 3% minimum regulatory capital requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with apartments reclassified as commercial loans, S&amp;Ls will be 
permitted to have only 30% of their loans in commercial projects including 
apartments, with 70% in single-family residential loans or residential mortgage 
securities. The lower apartment loan ratio, coupled with higher capital 
requirements, will translate into higher apartment development costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Force Change 
</P>
<P>
Roach said the bill is designed to either force S&amp;Ls out of real estate 
development altogether or to force them to set up stand-alone subsidiaries over 
a five-year period. The subsidiaries will constitute a "fire wall" between 
development activities and government liability for insured S&amp;L deposits 
that in the past were used to finance development, Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
Most S&amp;Ls are expected to get out of real estate development altogether 
because they will need all the cash capital they can muster to meet new and 
tougher equity standards by 1994. Most S&amp;Ls will have little money left 
over with which to capitalize the new development subsidiaries, Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the new rules will prohibit the development operations from 
borrowing low-cost loans from the sister S&amp;Ls, forcing the S&amp;L 
development arm to compete on an "even playing field" with other developers for 
outside debt capital, said Stan Ross, co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal 
&amp; Co., a Los Angeles-based accountancy and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disincentives, both Great American and Home Federal say they expect 
to remain active in real estate development, probably through subsidiaries. 
Home Federal in fact expects to form a new subsidiary within the next 30 days, 
perhaps using $50 million available in its HomeFed Corp. parent company for the 
initial capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Home Fed is an acknowledged leader among S&amp;Ls in real estate development, 
according to analyst Gary Gordon of PaineWebber in New York. Home Fed's net 
real estate development profit of $31 million in 1988 represented 28% of its 
net income last year. Home Fed now has about $200 million in equity invested in 
lots, apartments and houses. 
</P>
<P>
Home Fed is confident it can attract equity partners and borrow sufficient 
funds to keep its real estate development activities profitable under the new 
rules, although probably not as profitable as in the past, Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
Home Fed also has the luxury of having a surplus of capital relative to most 
other S&amp;Ls, a surplus that it will be able to allocate to the new real 
estate development entity if it so chooses. For example, Home Fed's tangible 
net worth, or shareholder equity minus good will, is now 4.9% of assets, far 
above the 3% minimum it will be required to have on hand by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's tangible net worth, by comparison, is now 2.6% of assets, 
meaning it will have to have to devote more resources to meeting minimum 
capital requirements than Home Fed over the next five years. Lindland said 
Monday that Great American is in no hurry to set up its development entity, 
adding that it will be accomplished over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's profit from real estate development activities last year was 
$26.1 million, more than half of its $49.4-million net income.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All is not rosy with Great American Bank, which dropped $2.625 for the week 
after reporting a loss of $.42 a share in its second quarter, said Irving Katz, 
director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. The drop was related 
to loan loss provisions for the bank's Arizona subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
But Great American stock may be undervalued, Katz said. At its Monday close of 
$10.625, the stock is selling at 62% of tangible book value of $17.22 a share. 
In addition, the Arizona loans represent only 5% of assets. And Great 
American's branch system is one of the best in Southern California, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached new post-October, 1987, 
crash highs. High-water marks for San Diego County-based firms were reached by 
Mail Boxes Etc. at $24.25, DH Technology at $13 and San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric at $42. SDG&amp;E stock is selling at $7 below the valuation of the 
SCE stock that SDG&amp;E shareholders would receive under terms of the proposed 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Bank hit a new high of $7.875, despite the fact that shareholders are 
due to receive $8.69 worth of Security Pacific National Bank stock if and when 
the merger clears regulatory hurdles. Southwest shareholders have already 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
First National Corp. gained $2 after declaring a 10% stock dividend and a 
10-cent-a-share cash dividend, and reporting sharply higher earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Biomagnetic Technologies, which develops biomagnetic imaging instruments used 
in the diagnosis of functional disorders in the brain, heart and neuromuscular 
systems, made its initial public stock offering of 1.5 million shares priced at 
$9 each. The stock closed the week unchanged at that price.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES REPORTS FTC SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional Industries in Agoura Hills said it settled a previously disclosed 
dispute with the Federal Trade Commission over some of Traditional's sales 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
The company had denied any wrongdoing and said last week that "virtually all of 
the terms of the settlement" involving changes in its sales practices already 
have been made. It also said the FTC did not order Traditional to pay a fine, 
but that Traditional had set up a $250,000 trust fund for possible refunds. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional sells packages of cameras, film and other photographic and video 
accessories directly to consumers, particularly newlyweds and new parents. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the FTC objected to Traditional using the word custom to 
advertise its picture enlargements when, in fact, some enlargements were simply 
a standard blowup of a photograph, Traditional has said. The FTC also found 
that some Traditional customers were not given a 3-day cancellation period 
offered to other customers, the company reported. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is subject to approval by FTC commissioners.

VALLEY EARNINGS: VALLEY FEDERAL S&amp;L'S LOSS NARROWS TO $2.55 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan reported a $2.55-million loss for the second 
quarter of 1989, compared with a $4.65-million loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The struggling Van Nuys-based thrift said its loss for the first half of 1989 
totaled $2.38 million. In the comparable year-earlier period, Valley Federal 
lost $3.26 million. As of June 30, its assets totaled $3.37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal blamed its latest losses on rising interest rates, which 
increased its costs of obtaining funds for lending, and on continued losses at 
its All Valley Acceptance unit, which provides financing for manufactured 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
For the three-month and six-month periods preceding June 30, All Valley 
Acceptance lost $4.9 million pretax and $8.7 million pretax, the company said.

LOWERING THE BOOM ON THINGS PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE M. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kiss the '60s goodby: Some nostalgia busters have arrived and are suiting up to 
make Baby Boomers' beloved sentimentality a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. for the Advancement of Time -- a group formed by John 
Kenney, 25, of New York; Bruce Elliot, 27, of Los Angeles; and Eugene 
Dillenburg, 29, of Chicago -- has proclaimed Aug. 14-20 as "Boycott the Past 
Week." 
</P>
<P>
During that period, the group wants Americans to "forgo the past," Kenney says. 
Don't "listen to oldies radio, watch movies or TV series set in the past, read 
articles written about the past and when you see an advertisement that's set to 
'60s music or totes a '60s theme, change the channel or turn the page." 
</P>
<P>
His group doesn't have anything against the '60s, "it's just the '80s 
preoccupation" with that period "that upsets us," Kenney says, explaining that 
"if nostalgia is left unchecked, people will begin to neglect the issues that 
face us in the present. People are using nostalgia as an escape from the 
problems that plague our society today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Glamorous' Time 
</P>
<P>
Lee Gold, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at USC, agrees, 
observing: "The past has been romanticized. The good ol' days, which were not 
so good anyway, are easier to deal with because the present isn't comfortable 
for us. The '60s were when this generation came of age. So as we get older, 
those times seem more glamorous to us because of our youth." 
</P>
<P>
Kenney says his group, with its campaign, is seeking two results: "People will 
see how hard it is to avoid images of the past, and we hope some people will 
see how consumed they are and put an end to their misery." 
</P>
<P>
What do group members find especially annoying? "Oh, the American Express 
commercials moving to the tunes of 'My Girl' and 'Be My Baby'," Kenney says. 
"TV shows like 'The Wonder Years' and 'China Beach'; miniskirts; Batman 
T-shirts; and classic rock."

Since it began last March, the association has found a receptive ear among the 
media, receiving coverage in local newspapers and broadcast outlets, USA Today, 
the "Today Show" and "CBS This Morning." The publicity the group has received 
also has prompted heavy mail from those who want to join. The association 
claims it has 280 members nationwide, as well as in Canada and Australia.

PERSONAL HEALTH: NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT, FOR ELDERLY, RESUSCITATION USUALLY 
FAILS, AND MAY EXTEND SUFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The elderly man has collapsed in the street. He isn't breathing and his 
heartbeat is erratic. One bystander rushes off to call paramedics, while 
another begins the lifesaving technique he learned in a weekend class, 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
This steady external massage of the chest, alternated with forcing air into the 
lungs, may help the old man. If he is lucky, his heart and lungs will start 
working again and after a few days in the hospital he'll be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
But, if he is not so lucky, CPR will doom him to spend days, weeks or months in 
a hospital's intensive care unit -- where he will die anyway. Or if his brain 
was deprived of oxygen for too long, he'll leave the hospital in a coma or 
demented. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a study published in today's Annals of Internal Medicine puts some 
numbers on this tragic twist of fate that doctors say is all too common. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life-Saving Statistics 
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts study of 503 people over age 70 who received CPR found that 
112 of them were revived initially, but only 19 lived to leave the hospital. Of 
those, eight were well enough to go home. The rest faced a future in a nursing 
home or a rehabilitation hospital; two were severely debilitated, one in a 
vegetative state and the other severely demented and totally dependent. 
</P>
<P>
These results point out what some doctors have been saying as CPR approaches 
its fourth decade of widespread use: That a technique that is routine in 
hospitals and on the street is medically inappropriate, even inhumane, to 
deliver to some patients, many of them elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, doctors, bioethicists, hospital administrators and 
patients' rights groups are tackling this issue, trying to figure out when "do 
not resuscitate" orders should be issued and who should be involved in making 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically the Golden Rule," said Dr. Donald J. Murphy, assistant 
professor of health sciences at George Washington University in Washington, 
D.C., and principal author of the study published today. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we so willingly resuscitate an 80-year-old woman who's trying to die 
at home when the vast majority of health-care providers who are aware of the 
implications of CPR would refuse that treatment for themselves?" Murphy asked. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, CPR should be started within five minutes of the time that breathing 
and the heartbeat stop, to prevent irreversible damage to the brain and nervous 
system from lack of oxygen. Damage seems to occur more easily in the elderly, 
doctors say, though no one is sure if age itself or the illnesses that 
accompany aging are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Firmly planted at one extreme in the "do not resuscitate" debate, Murphy takes 
the controversial stance that doctors should issue DNR orders for certain 
patients in nursing homes and hospitals without consulting either the patients 
or their families. Doctors are under no obligation to inform patients about 
medical therapies that are futile, he wrote in an October article in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is being talked about so much in the medical community that the 
prestigious bioethics think tank, the Hastings Center, is including a 
discussion of it in an educational program it is developing for hospital 
officials, said Dr. Kathleen Nolan, associate for medicine at the center. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of clinicians agree with him because I think he speaks for their desire 
to avoid giving useless care," Nolan said of Murphy. "Clinicians do hate to 
fail, and (CPR on extremely ill patients) sets them up for failure. I think 
they also don't like talking about these issues with people. But within the 
bioethics community there's much greater resistance to the notion." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan is among those who concur with Murphy that CPR is being done on too many 
people, but who disagree with his proposed remedy. They say doctors of 
seriously ill patients should talk to them or their families about the minimal 
chances for a successful resuscitation, and let the patients or families 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
"CPR should be less frequently used but it should be less frequently used 
because patients have assumed more of a role in their own care," Nolan said. 
"What I would like to see is for people to have more control of all medical 
interventions at the time of the death." 
</P>
<P>
Survival after resuscitation for all age groups is not as good as might be 
expected after more than 20 years of promotion of it by the American Heart 
Assn. and the American Red Cross. In the 1987-88 fiscal year alone, the Red 
Cross certified 2.5 million Americans to perform CPR. 
</P>
<P>
In hospitals, where the chances of being revived by CPR are greatest, the 
procedure is performed on one-third of the patients who go into cardiopulmonary 
arrest. Ten percent of these people receiving CPR survive to leave the 
hospital. Two percent of the survivors are left in a persistent vegetative 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it is the otherwise healthy victims of traffic, drowning or other 
accidents who are among the few CPR recipients who eventually can go on to lead 
normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics and emergency room doctors know from experience as well as research 
that, for an elderly patient from a nursing home, revival by CPR will most 
probably doom the patient to days or weeks in an intensive care unit, after 
which he will die anyway. Yet half of the in-hospital CPR attempts in this 
country are done on people older than 65. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that his own experience talking about CPR with about 200 
nursing-home patients in Boston found only two who wanted to be resuscitated -- 
a concentration camp survivor and a former professional boxer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Interest 
</P>
<P>
For that other 198, he says, performing CPR on them not only would go against 
the patient's best interest but also would fill scarce critical-care beds with 
people who have virtually no chance of surviving. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, even those who acknowledge this problem are largely unwilling to 
abandon resuscitation attempts without getting a patient's or a family's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
"As more and more elderly patients with chronic illnesses and severe dementia 
fill beds in long-term care facilities in the decades ahead, the problem may 
become monumental. . . . (But) until we reach a public consensus about how to 
deal with these very difficult issues, individual clinicians and institutions 
should continue to separate concerns about patient welfare from broader social 
and economic policy issues," wrote Dr. Stuart J. Youngner of Case Western 
Reserve University in a response to Murphy's October article. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Miller, a Covina physician and vice chairman of the CPR Committee of 
the American Heart Assn., said that the association's first booklet on CPR 
promoted it only for use in "sudden unexpected death." With that as the 
standard, roughly half of all CPR attempts in the late 1960s and early 1970s 
gave good results, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nose dive in success rates since then is a result of it being done to 
virtually everyone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Hockberger, director of emergency medicine at L.A. County 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, said resuscitation is attempted on all emergency 
patients there unless doctors know that the patient doesn't want it, has a 
terminal, incurable disease or is in a chronic vegetative state. 
</P>
<P>
But emergencies by definition often don't let a doctor know such information, 
and a doctor can't tell just by looking at someone that CPR won't work well, 
Hockberger said. "When you haven't been breathing for 15 minutes, you don't 
look good even if you're 35 years old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The very nature of resuscitation is that if it's going to be useful at all, 
it's got to be started within the first three or four minutes of the time the 
heart stopped, and that doesn't give you a whole lot of time to investigate all 
of these possibilities," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to preserve life. If you're going to err in one direction or 
another, I think most of us feel that we'd rather err on the side of trying to 
save a life, knowing that sometimes it may have been somebody who was not a 
good candidate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influencing the Debate 
</P>
<P>
One also has to be careful about "ageism" influencing the debate with 
assumptions that just because someone is old, they must be infirm, doctors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a question of which elderly," Miller said. "I'm concerned about 
putting an absolute age limit on it." 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is whether CPR does any good or not," said Dr. Marshall 
Morgan, director of emergency medicine at UCLA Medical Center. "Of these 500 
people that were attempted to be resuscitated, 10 of them are at home. Ask one 
of those 10: Would they be happier if nobody had tried to resuscitate them? 
It's a matter of whether the glass is half full or half empty." 
</P>
<P>
The most responsible solution to futile CPR attempts, many believe, is for 
physicians to talk to their elderly or chronically ill patients in advance 
about just how far doctors should go to save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he believes that for the most part that won't happen, because 
doctors and families are uncomfortable talking about such issues. 
</P>
<P>
But patients, too, can bring up the subject, and they ought to, said Sandra 
Sweeney, manager of special projects for the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
"We would encourage people to discuss this sort of thing with their doctors and 
with their families," Sweeney said. "We would encourage them to think through 
what their own feelings are about these life-and-death issues. They should 
really be very specific: 'I don't want a respirator, but I do want food and 
hydration.' " 
</P>
<P>
The living will, which specifies a person's health-care preferences but 
generally applies only if the person is terminally ill, is recognized as 
legally binding in 40 states. (The 10 that don't have living will laws are: 
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota.) 
</P>
<P>
If a person feels strongly that CPR and all other medical measures should be 
taken to preserve life, that too can be specified in a document known as a 
durable power of attorney, Sweeney noted. This option is available in all 
states and is applicable also in non-life-threatening situations such as 
incapacity caused by a stroke, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RESULTS OF RESUSCITATION 
</P>
<P>
Despite the advent of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 400,000 to 600,000 
persons die every year in the United States from sudden cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
CPR was first described in medical literature in 1960. Since then it has become 
standard therapy delivered by emergency medical personnel and informed 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
Among the general population, its success, defined as the patient leaving the 
hospital alive, has been reported as high as 30%, but generally it was about 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
Among the elderly and some extremely ill persons (such as those with pneumonia 
or kidney failure), studies show the success rate of CPR is almost nil. 
</P>
<P>
A study published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine considered 503 
patients age 70 or older who received CPR. Results of the study: 
</P>
<P>
Initial survivors -- 112 (22%) Survivors discharged from hospital, only two of 
whom had cardiac arrests outside the hospital -- 19 (3.8%) 
</P>
<P>
Survivors with no physical or mental damage -- 9 (1.8%) 
</P>
<P>
Survivors severely demented or totally dependent -- 2 (0.4%) 
</P>
<P>
Successful resuscitation attempts on elderly patients are extremely rare if: 
The cardiac arrest occurred outside a hospital . . . 
</P>
<P>
or the patient had several acute or chronic health problems . . . 
</P>
<P>
or the resuscitation attempt lasted more than 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The elderly, and anyone else who feels strongly about what kind of medical 
procedures should be used on them, are advised to take steps in advance of 
illness to assure their wishes will be met. 
</P>
<P>
A free booklet on such issues, "Tomorrow's Choices," is available in single 
copies from the American Assn. of Retired Persons, Fulfillment, 1909 K St. NW, 
Washington, D.C. 20049.

A BRAWLER TAKES UP NOVELIST'S PEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Wheeler offered a good-natured apology but couldn't suppress a grin 
when he heard a visitor had disabled a car trying to negotiate the steep, 
rutted, rock-strewn cowpath up to his rustic mountain retreat. 
</P>
<P>
He has gone to great lengths to put a rugged buffer between himself and the 
world, and he clearly was pleased to learn it works. As satisfied as he is that 
people are discovering his fiction, Wheeler hopes no one discovers him. 
</P>
<P>
A disdain for celebrity would hardly surprise those who knew Wheeler before an 
accident blinded him 14 years ago. Back then, he was a biker and a brawler; he 
worked on building sites, not novels, and spent his leisure time in crowded 
bars, not secluded retreats. 
</P>
<P>
His first novel, "Snakewalk," has just been published by Harmony Books, a 
division of Crown, and his agent is asking him to sign a deal to film his 
semi-autobiography about coping with blindness. First novelists at this point 
should be ecstatic. Wheeler would rather be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get out of all that man-made stress (of the city), you can focus on 
what you are and why you're here," he explained after a day of work at his 
retreat, which is at the moment a rough campsite with a trailer. "You have to 
live in a place that's in tune with your own electrochemical reactions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Affected About Him 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds like loopy, affected authorspeak, forget it. There's nothing 
discernibly loopy or affected about the tall, lean, 42-year-old author whose 
presence -- not to mention his goatee and flinty expression -- hint at his 
affection for motorcycles. "Moving here also took off a lot of the social 
pressures on me," he added thoughtfully, referring to a long but vague list of 
dust-ups with cops and others who ran afoul of his unyielding personal sense of 
right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
He paused, pulled hard on a can of Miller High Life, then offered candidly, 
"You won't find a lot of people who like me." 
</P>
<P>
That is hard to believe after spending an evening with the author, his wife, 
Jaimie, and their 17-month-old son, Kendal Gus, at their bucolic home site in 
the Cascade Range near this quaint southern Oregon college town. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, it is quite evident that Wheeler, like his protagonist Patrick Todd 
in "Snakewalk," is not one to calmly suffer others' shortcomings. Especially 
not people who subscribe to what he calls the "adipose guide" -- mindless 
slaves to conformity, convention and greed. 
</P>
<P>
What people will find, if Wheeler allows them to, is an engaging paradox: a 
gentle family man and sensitive naturalist with an unrepented history of fast, 
sometimes violent living and an insatiable appetite for adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
He is a man with a love of speed so intense that he recently bought a 
long-coveted Porsche, even though his blindness keeps him from behind the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"I still like fast things," he confessed. "I still like the risk factor in 
life." 
</P>
<P>
He is, also, a man with enough talent to give sighted people -- "eyeballs" he 
calls them -- a vivid glimpse of life without sight. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler was blinded in 1975 when a friend's fishing boat capsized and 
disintegrated in rough weather, seriously wounding the 28-year-old heavy 
equipment operator and hell-raiser shortly before he was to leave for Alaska, 
where he hoped to make enough money to go into business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fictional Version 
</P>
<P>
"Snakewalk" is a fictional retelling of the accident and subsequent effort of 
young, tough, lustful Patrick Todd to deal with sudden blindness -- and in turn 
resolve his own identity and learn to try to balance intellect with impulse. 
</P>
<P>
The story unfolds at the fictional California Institute for the Blind, in a San 
Francisco Bay Area town not unlike Wheeler's blue-collar boyhood hometown, El 
Cerrito, Calif. The snakewalk is a serpentine path where new "blinks," or 
blind-school students, gather to drink and talk. As the most direct route from 
the school to a busy street, Wheeler adds, the snakewalk also is the 
metaphorical link between the worlds of those who cannot see and those who can. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler's protagonist adjusts slowly to the school, where he comes to learn to 
read Braille, translate such routine tasks as banking into other senses and 
develop the ability to navigate without eyes. 
</P>
<P>
He also learns, from a hard-drinking part-Indian spiritual and intellectual 
alter ego called Cole Saunders, to redirect his anger, intelligence and energy 
to something other than fighting, fishing and female conquests. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in the style of Ken Kesey, Wheeler's character shares his 
personal courage, iconoclasm and unshakable zest for life with the more timid 
students around him. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said he began working on the novel "as a kind of therapy after the 
accident," hoping to gain some personal insight into his disability while also 
offering sighted people a different, more realistic perspective on blindness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revealed an Outlet 
</P>
<P>
Therapy became avocation when Wheeler's early writing introduced him to his 
latent talent. He realized fiction offered him a satisfying new outlet for the 
passion and energy he previously spent on racing and carousing. 
</P>
<P>
He said his confidence and ambition flowered when a Playboy magazine editor 
attached an encouraging letter to a rejection slip for one of Wheeler's short 
stories, the tale of an eccentric who collects unmentionable souvenirs in the 
women's room of a Wyoming roadhouse. 
</P>
<P>
At "blink school," as he calls the rehabilitation center, Wheeler said he 
realized a blind man is better off working with his brain instead of his back, 
and he enrolled as a philosophy student at Solano Community College in Suisun 
City, Calif. Meanwhile, he expanded his written observations on blindness, the 
heart of "Snakewalk," to novel length. 
</P>
<P>
He continued working on the project after transferring to UC Davis, to which he 
commuted twice a week by Greyhound bus from a riverfront home in tiny Anderson, 
Calif., more than 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
After starting at Davis, he changed his field of study to creative writing, 
quitting philosophy and giving up his earlier goal of going to law school. 
</P>
<P>
At Davis, Wheeler met two women who profoundly influenced his life. 
</P>
<P>
One was a fellow student, Jaimie Bernhagen, an engaging Dana Point, Calif., 
native who became his fourth wife a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
The other was the instructor who taught his final graduate writing seminar, 
writer Diane Johnson ("Terrorists and Novelists," "Persian Nights"), who 
recognized in his master's project the kernel of what later became "Snakewalk." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson introduced Wheeler and his manuscript to San Francisco literary agent 
Bonnie Nadell. She forwarded the novel to Michael Pietsch, an editor at Harmony 
Books in New York. Pietsch wrestled with Wheeler through numerous rewrites that 
finally produced a tight, smooth narrative. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler lauded four people -- Bernhagen, Johnson, Nadell and Pietsch -- in an 
introduction to his book, but he reserves particular praise for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Praise 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's making a big deal out of me, but we are no better than who we are 
with," he said. "I wouldn't be doing any of this if Jaimie wasn't here with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
As she gets up to tend their son, he leaned over and proudly confided: "We must 
have lived together in another life. We are real comfortable together." 
</P>
<P>
He said his wife helps him with his writing process, which involves working out 
a story in his head and dictating early drafts into a tape recorder before 
entering later drafts into a home computer equipped with a voice synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
Jaimie, who has literary interests of her own and hopes to return to school 
soon to complete college, modestly shrugged off Wheeler's praise, as she later 
dismissed the hardships of their crude encampment, a trailer with no utilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since we arrived there, we wanted to leave," she said, referring to their 
former home, a ranch-style house overlooking the Sacramento River near 
Anderson. "A pool to maintain, a lawn to mow, fences penning the dogs -- it 
just was not our cup of tea. We are actually much happier in this 39-foot 
fifth-wheel (camp trailer) than we were there." 
</P>
<P>
"I miss some of the conveniences," Wheeler added, citing the present need to 
bathe outdoors in icy spring water, "but if your sense of humor stays intact, 
you can get through most anything." 
</P>
<P>
One of his biggest problems so far is the impact he is having on the land. He 
still broods over a rattlesnake accidentally crushed by the bulldozer the day 
he arrived. And he laments a skunk killed by his dogs: Generally, he 
appreciates his Oregon retreat and doesn't miss California even a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In a Dog Kennel' 
</P>
<P>
"In California -- I won't say all of it, but just about all of it -- you are in 
a dog kennel," he said. "You go for what you can get for yourself when you can 
get it without worrying about the overall peace. If you can go for the throat 
of the big boy next to you, then you grab him by the throat and rip out the 
jugular. Automatically. Reflexively. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what I write about. I write about a dissolving civilization -- the 
decline of compassion of one human being for another." 
</P>
<P>
Such startling observations are not unusual when talking to Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually," he opined at another point in the evening, "the cream of your 
society is found in bars, soaking up alcohol and numbing themselves from their 
own potential because that's easier than endeavoring to change things." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Wheeler, a former world-class drinker who still is familiar 
with a beer 12-pack, avoids bars these days -- ever since irritating some 
locals by toppling a local arm-wrestling champion. 
</P>
<P>
As quickly as some topics can irritate him, others can just as swiftly calm 
him. One is the pleasure of writing. Another is the enjoyment of hiking in the 
woods with his four dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"When my facial vision is working, I can walk anywhere with the dogs," he said, 
referring to the use of nerve-packed facial tissue to sense obstacles in one's 
path. "When it isn't working, I might as well be in a closet." 
</P>
<P>
Not that that indicates any measure of surrender to a handicap. Not in someone 
who responded to counselors who said it would take two years to master Braille 
by learning it in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a salmon," he said. "Someone will dam a river, and salmon will wear 
off their faces nosing around for some way to get past it." 
</P>
<P>
Hardships are not new to Wheeler, the second-oldest of eight children of an El 
Cerrito police officer. Wheeler said his father moved the family into a 
converted chicken coop. The $3,500 price meant manageable monthly payments of 
$15, but Wheeler said his dad still owed $1,700 on it when he died in 1961 in a 
boating accident. 
</P>
<P>
Books were scarce in his home. Wheeler read little before he lost his sight. 
Since then, he has followed the advice of teachers and listened to many hours 
of tape-recorded American masters, including Faulkner and Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
That Wheeler's father was a policeman will come as a surprise to people who 
know the author. Not only has he had his share of often violent confrontations 
with police officers -- most recently in Anderson, where a run-in cost him five 
days in the county lock-up -- but the police also serve as antagonists in much 
of his writing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are good cops and bad cops, like anything else," Wheeler said with a 
shrug, placing his father in the former category. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Wheeler is eager to make sure that any film version of his book has 
balance with all his characters, including the blind students. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent a lot of time and a lot of pain on this," he said, "and I don't want 
to see blind people slabbed out there, as being all one thing or another. 
They're as individual as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the praise implicit in the remarkable process by which his work was 
discovered and favorable pre-publication reviews, Wheeler believes he has only 
begun the process of developing his talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still in the minor leagues as a writer," he said, keeping an ear on his 
son as he played near a bulldozer and backhoe resting on land destined for a 
large log home supplied with water and power from a nearby spring. "I still 
have so much to learn about my craft. I think of 'Bottoms' as my real debut as 
a writer." 
</P>
<P>
"Bottoms" is a second novel, still in progress, about the denizens of a Texas 
junkyard. It is loosely based, he said, on the experiences of a family friend, 
called Grandy in the book, who quit the aerospace business "to open up that 
junkyard and make millions off the discards of America." 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler smiles at the absurdity of that notion, and at the junkyard owner's 
conviction that only compulsive womanizing will keep him alive forever. And he 
relishes recalling how the real Grandy, whom Wheeler considers a second father 
and after whom he named his younger son, valiantly resisted the big-money boys 
who came to buy him out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hard-headed old man," Wheeler said, "and about the only friend I have." 
</P>
<P>
Relying so directly on his own life gives him no pause. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I write is going to be autobiographical," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, Wheeler is not writing at all. He has a publicity tour for 
"Snakewalk" and prefers focusing his energy on improving his retreat, where the 
only electricity comes from automobile batteries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got three other books -- four, possibly -- kicking around in my brain all 
the time," he said. "When one gets ripe, I'll stop and write it. I will have 
to."

EX-PRISONERS CLEARED TO ENTER U.S.;

<P>
VIETNAMESE IN O.C. HAIL PACT ALLOWING EMIGRATION 
</P>

An agreement that would free thousands of former Vietnamese prisoners to 
emigrate to the United States was hailed in Orange County Monday as "a major 
breakthrough," and one that could mean reunification of many families in the 
largest Vietnamese community in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, this is good news because we have been waiting for so long," said Nhu Hao 
T. Duong, executive director for the Community Resources Opportunity Project in 
Santa Ana. "To us, this is a major breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of negotiations between the United States and Vietnam, the former 
prisoners and their families -- as many as 100,000 Vietnamese, by initial State 
Department accounts -- may be eligible for emigration. The first 3,000 are 
expected to arrive in the United States by the end of the year, U.S. State 
Department officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
No details were immediately available about where the Vietnamese immigrants 
will be settled in the United States, but about 40% of all past refugees from 
the Southeast Asian nation have chosen California, and the majority of those 
moved to Orange County. Mostly centered in the cities of Westminster and Garden 
Grove, the Orange County Vietnamese community numbers close to 100,000, its 
leaders estimate. 
</P>
<P>
But while Vietnamese community leaders in Orange County and some government 
officials welcomed the news, other officials tempered their enthusiasm with 
concern about the impact of a new wave of immigration on already-strained local 
government budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a Westminster problem, this is a federal government problem," said 
Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith regarding resettlement under the new 
agreement. He added that he expects few new refugees to settle in his city 
because housing is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's agreement was worked out in negotiations between Robert L. Funseth, 
senior deputy secretary of state, and Vu Khoan, Vietnam's assistant minister of 
foreign affairs, who met in Hanoi last week. In the joint announcement, they 
said the program could begin as soon as October. 
</P>
<P>
They said the talks were initiated "to resolve one of the issues of mutual 
concern to the two countries." That issue involved the fate of former soldiers, 
government officials and others who had been loyal to the U.S.-supported South 
Vietnamese government in Saigon before it was overrun by North Vietnamese 
forces in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) said the announcement of 
the pact is "really good news" and is in keeping with the congressman's efforts 
to give priority to the emigration of people kept in Vietnamese re-education 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan spokesman Brian Bennett also predicted that immigrants who choose to 
come to Orange County will soon become productive residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Vietnamese community here will do as they have in the past -- 
provide houses and jobs and whatever else they need to get on their feet 
themselves," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, whose district includes portions 
of Garden Grove and Westminster, said the county will need to look to the state 
and federal governments to assist in funding public services for any new 
Vietnamese immigrants. "Health care will be greatly affected," he said, unless 
the county receives federal aid similar to that received in reaction to the 
wave of immigration following the fall of Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Councilman Robert F. Dinsen said the immigrants could cause a new 
round of adjustment problems in his city. "It will be a period of time until 
they (new immigrants) adjust, and the Caucasians learn to live with them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Vietnamese leaders acknowledged, too, that the immigrants will 
need various special services to help them start new lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The English (language) training, job training and mental health services -- 
all these things will be needed," said Duong, the director for the Vietnamese 
community-resource project. 
</P>
<P>
While hailing the agreement, the Vietnamese refugee leaders said they remain 
suspicious that the Vietnamese government may be using the issue to seek 
diplomatic relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good-will gesture for Vietnam, (but) in the eyes of the nation's 
Vietnamese community, we think that Vietnam wants to establish relations with 
the United States later," said Le Xuan Khoa, director of the Indochina Resource 
Action Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But others, especially those with relatives in Vietnam, were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good news for everybody," said Tien Nguyen of Costa Mesa, a former South 
Vietnamese air force officer whose 56-year-old brother remains in a Vietnamese 
re-education camp. "The key victory for us who are the activists in the 
community is that we wanted the U.S. never to stop thinking about those people 
in Vietnam who fought for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them have been put in jail for 10 years or longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE HAPPY, BUT -- Members of the Orange County Vietnamese community react 
with caution. Part II, Page 1.

REPORT SAYS LYON'S TIES CLINCHED DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. DEVELOPERS WHO OUTBID HIM SAW FAVORITISM BY HUD 
</P>

Two Southern California developers who tried to buy Orange County's Robinson 
Ranch from HUD in 1985 told federal investigators that they believe that the 
property was sold to the William Lyon Co. because of Lyon's political influence 
and friendship with a key HUD official, according to an internal HUD report. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development report, triggered by an 
investigation of the developers' complaints, noted: "Our analysis . . . 
indicated improper award practices, conclusions and possible favoritism to the 
William Lyon Co.," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Position With Builders Group 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 4, 1985, report -- a copy of which was obtained by The Times on Monday 
-- quoted the two developers as saying they believe that Shirley M. Wiseman, 
then an acting assistant HUD secretary, wanted Lyon's help in gaining a 
position with the National Assn. of Home Builders when she left HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman was elected president of the association the following year, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon, originally the lowest of four bidders, paid $16 million for the scenic 
rural property near Mission Viejo and Coto de Caza. The land, according to HUD 
documents obtained by The Times, was valued at about $35 million at the time of 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Best Offer' 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman, accepting a recommendation from her handpicked internal committee, 
approved the sale to Lyon despite a warning from HUD's general counsel "that 
the William Lyon Co.'s all-cash bid was not the best offer." 
</P>
<P>
Although the losing developers complained of favoritism to HUD, two officials 
of the home builders group -- one of whom was defeated by Wiseman for the 
presidency -- said Monday that they do not believe that Lyon influenced her 
election. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, one of the developers quoted in the HUD report denied through a 
spokesman Monday that he told HUD that Lyon was sold the property through 
favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
An associate of Wiseman in Washington said she was traveling and would not be 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon and officials from his Newport Beach development company also did not 
return repeated telephone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinson Ranch sale was investigated by HUD's inspector general in San 
Francisco when the two higher bidders -- Kaufman &amp; Broad of Los Angeles and 
Simpson/Marlboro of Tustin/Los Angeles -- complained. The report, signed by 
Miguel P. Barrios Jr., HUD's regional inspector general for audits, criticized 
Wiseman for awarding the 827-acre property to Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Figure in HUD Scandal 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman has been a key figure in the developing HUD scandal, which has focused 
on political influence peddling and on up to $1 billion in losses from flawed 
or questionable projects initiated by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman recently testified before a House committee investigating the scandal. 
She was praised during the hearing for refusing to obey orders to approve a 
project proposed by an influential Republican developer. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon was host at his Coto de Caza home for a fund-raiser for former President 
Reagan's library last year. Lyon has contributed about $200,000 to Republican 
committees and candidates since 1980, records show. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-page HUD report summarizes interviews with executives from two of the 
three companies that bid unsuccessfully on the Robinson Ranch. Both developers 
are quoted in the report as saying Wiseman and Lyon were friends or "close 
friends . . . based on general 'word-of-mouth' comments." 
</P>
<P>
The report says Robert L. Simpson, a principal in the Simpson/Marlboro 
development group, "volunteered that it is common knowledge that Ms. Wiseman 
had two ambitions when at HUD -- the first was to become assistant secretary of 
the Federal Housing Administration, and the second was to become an officer of 
the National Assn. of Home Builders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Her Goals 
</P>
<P>
Simpson "stated that it 'won't hurt' her chances to have William Lyon's support 
in these goals," it adds. 
</P>
<P>
The report also summarizes interviews with Clyde W. Lane, president of Kaufman 
&amp; Broad's Urban Division in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lane "stated that it was generally believed in the development community that 
Ms. Wiseman was leaving HUD and was trying to secure a position with the 
National Assn. of Home Builders and needed the support of William Lyon, who is 
active in this association," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Lane "implied that William Lyon had lunch with Ms. Wiseman when he visited 
Washington, D.C.," the report adds. "Mr. Lane also implied that Mr. Lyon was 
given preference because of his political contributions to the Republicans and 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
"He emphasized that he had no proof of these allegations," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Requests to speak to Lane were referred to Mike Sittrick, spokesman for Kaufman 
&amp; Broad, who said Monday that Lane denies that he said Lyon received the 
property because of his friendship or politics. 
</P>
<P>
"He said the characterization as to why Lyon got the land is not accurate," 
Sittrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson was not available for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Stuard, head of Stuard Industries in El Toro and former president of the 
home builders association, said: "It is absolutely impossible to make a case 
that Bill Lyon helped (Wiseman) get where she was in the organization." 
</P>
<P>
Stuard said Lyon is "not a power player in the organization." 
</P>
<P>
F. David Young, a Laguna Beach developer who ran for president of the home 
builders association against Wiseman in 1986, also said he does not believe 
that Lyon played a role in Wiseman's election. 
</P>
<P>
"He never threw his weight around," Young said. He added that Wiseman beat him 
because "she did her homework" and raised more money for her campaign than he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinson Ranch was seized by HUDiin 1984 when the Ridgewood Development Co. 
defaulted on a $35-million loan that was guaranteed under HUD's Title X 
program. The Title X program is designed to provide incentives for developers 
to build on otherwise-difficult properties. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgewood tried to retain the property and renegotiate its loan with HUD, 
President Harriet Harris said. But she became frustrated at HUD's lack of 
cooperation and eventually wrote a letter to then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce 
that also hinted of politics influencing the process. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard of deals being made by people whose political connections with 
the department enable them to achieve an inside track," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD report says Lyon's original bid on the project of $8.5 million was the 
lowest of four that were considered by HUD officials. 
</P>
<P>
The report was critical of the sales process because Lyon was then allowed to 
submit a second bid based on a higher rate of development than the others had 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
The other companies were never given a chance to prepare a bid based on a 
higher rate of development, the report says, and if they had, their bids would 
have been better than Lyon's. 
</P>
<P>
The report notes that Wiseman refused to reveal Lyon's bid to Kaufman &amp; 
Broad and that the information had to be obtained with the Freedom of 
Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HUD Lost at Least $10 Million 
</P>
<P>
Lyon eventually bought the property for about $16 million, causing HUD to lose 
at least $10 million when it was forced to pay the defaulted loan, said Jack 
Flynn, a HUD spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to Lyon was given final approval by Wiseman after it was screened by a 
five-member committee she appointed. The report says two of the five members 
backed Lyon's bid, one supported Simpson/Marlboro, one voted for Kaufman &amp; 
Broad and the fifth did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
The report says "a significant factor" in the decision of the two committee 
members supporting Lyon was that his firm has a proven track record of 
development in Southern California and is financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
But the report also notes: "Kaufman &amp; Broad is the largest home builder in 
California, with 1984 sales of $361.5 million."

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING; 
</P>
<P>
WEDDINGS NOT BLISSFUL FOR PARK'S NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Pines Park virtually resonates romance. The little four-acre site on bluffs 
overlooking Capistrano Beach commands a spectacular ocean view. Stately pines 
shade lush, jade-green grass. 
</P>
<P>
It's a perfect place for weddings -- in fact hundreds of couples have gone 
there in recent years to say their vows. But neighbors and the Capistrano Bay 
Park and Recreation District think there can be too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a grump, and I'm not anti-romance, but it's just gotten out of hand," 
said Carol Parker, who lives in the 34900 block of Camino Capistrano in Dana 
Point, across the street from Pines Park. She added, "This isn't a neighborhood 
park any longer. They've made it into a wedding chapel." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing complaints from Parker and many other neighbors, the Capistrano 
Bay Park and Recreation District has acted to put a limit on what neighbors 
contend has been a nuptials explosion. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the district board -- an independent governmental agency that 
serves the same geographical area as the new city of Dana Point -- will 
consider giving final approval to a law that would regulate the weddings. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighbors say their street is being tied up with traffic and parking 
problems," said David A. Lewis, park district administrator. "And the neighbors 
tell us some of the wedding people are knocking on doors to use the bathrooms 
or to borrow rice or to plug in electric cords for the organ music." 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance requires couples to get a park district permit before staging 
a wedding. "That's always been our district's policy, but a policy can't be 
enforced, and an ordinance can," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be limiting wedding permits at the park to every other weekend. And 
after the ordinance becomes effective, anyone having a wedding without a park 
permit can be fined $250." A park-use permit for weddings costs $50 an hour, 
Lewis said. The new ordinance will become effective the first week in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to keep weddings to every other weekend under our present 
policy, but people have been coming there every weekend, and even on weekdays, 
for marriages," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Parker and her next-door neighbor, Leigh Julius, looked out on Pines 
Park, which faces their front doors. They shook their heads as they swapped 
horror stories about seemingly endless wedding groups using the park. And they 
said they hope the new ordinance restores some peace to the bluff-top 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't have any consideration for the people who live across the 
street from the park," Julius said as she held Mackenzie, her 3-month-old baby 
girl. "They block our driveways. They ask if they can use bathrooms. They ask 
to borrow things, including tools from the workman who's putting an addition 
onto our house." 
</P>
<P>
Parker broke into a grin as she recalled some of the funnier episodes "of 
living across the street from an outdoor wedding chapel." 
</P>
<P>
"One time," Parker recalled, "this woman came to my door and said she wanted to 
hide on the porch and watch the wedding across the street in the park. It 
turned out she was divorced, and her ex-husband was getting married over there. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I've had people coming to my house to try to get rice or to borrow a 
necktie. And I had one bride who wanted to wash her wedding veil because it got 
dirty. Another wedding group wanted to borrow some bug spray to get rid of ants 
in the park. It gets wild." 
</P>
<P>
Park district administrator Lewis, in a separate interview on Monday, also 
related some amusing anecdotes from park weddings. But he added, "These things 
aren't funny for the neighbors of the park." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis noted that Pines Park has no restrooms. "So it's a big problem for the 
neighbors when people at the weddings knock on doors and want to use the 
bathrooms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was even one case where a wedding party told a neighbor to stop mowing 
his yard because they didn't want the noise," Lewis added. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for the people who live around the park, and we're trying to get some 
balance into the situation with this ordinance. We think it's a good 
compromise. This way we'll be able to schedule and to limit the weddings. As it 
is now, the weddings go on early mornings throughout late afternoons, even on 
weekends when there are not supposed to be any weddings there." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said applicants must file for a park wedding permit at least two weeks in 
advance. The new ordinance, he added, will be effective for the district's 
other parks as well. "In addition to Pines Park, we get a lot of weddings in 
Heritage Park and Louise Leydon Park," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
People who live near Pines Park said Monday that from time to time newspapers 
or magazines write about the photogenic little greensward. "And there'll even 
be maps showing people how to get to the park, and then these strangers come 
from everywhere to use the park or to get married here." 
</P>
<P>
Julius conceded that at times she has enjoyed watching the park weddings. "We 
stand over here and look at the wedding parties and critique the dresses and 
things like that," she said. "But there are so many of them, it's just gotten 
out of hand now." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lewis, neighbors will be notified which weekends are officially 
sanctioned for Pines Park weddings. There will even be a list of those couples 
who obtained permits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department, which provides law enforcement services 
to the city of Dana Point, of which Capistrano Beach is now a part, will cite 
couples trying to marry there without a permit, Lewis added. 
</P>
<P>
But Julius and Parker wondered aloud on Monday at how the enforcement was going 
to work. "Do they expect the neighbors to go over there and demand the wedding 
parties to produce their permits?" Julius asked. "I don't think we're going to 
be doing that and get beat up for our trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis acknowledged that enforcement of the wedding policy "is going to be a 
tough call." He added, "No one wants to bust someone on their wedding day."

EX-HOSTAGE ANGRY OVER REPORT, U.S. 'PARALYSIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Former hostage David Jacobsen reacted angrily Monday to reports that Marine Lt. 
Col. William Higgins has been hanged in retaliation for Israel's kidnaping of a 
Muslem cleric, and charged that the military operation may have scuttled the 
anticipated release of another American captive in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, who was reunited in November, 1986, with his family in Orange County 
after 17 months of captivity by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, said "good 
sources" in London had informed him that hostage Terry A. Anderson was to be 
released last Saturday as a gesture of good will by the new Iranian government. 
Anderson, a Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, was captured in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, a former hospital administrator from Huntington Beach, also assailed 
the U.S. State Department for what he termed its "paralysis" since the 
Iran/Contra scandal in any effort to win release of the eight Americans still 
being held in Lebanon. President Bush should assign responsibility for all 
hostage release and rescue efforts to the Justice Department, the FBI, or the 
CIA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"These men have been forgotten and not a damn thing has been done for them in 
two years," said Jacobsen, 59, in a telephone interview from Colorado, where he 
now lives. "I'm very angry about that. My friends should be home and they would 
have been home if they hadn't had some partisan politics in Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern for Friend Expressed 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman in Washington declined comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, administrator of the American University Hospital in Beirut when he 
was kidnaped on May 28, 1985, expressed grave concern for the well-being of his 
close friend, Joseph J. Cicippio, another American University executive who 
also has been marked for death by his militant Shiite Muslem captors unless the 
Muslem cleric kidnaped by the Israelis is released. Jacobsen said he also 
believes American hostages Frank Herbert Reed, who previously tried to escape, 
and Edward Tracy, who is reported to be mentally ill, may also be killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great pain for Robin Higgins (the wife of Lt. Col. Higgins) and their 
daughter, Chrissy, and pain for the families of the other hostages who live in 
fear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen also charged that "Israel is guilty of very bad timing" in the 
commando kidnaping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and two other Shiite Muslems in 
southern Lebanon last week. But he added that the U.S. should consider military 
retaliation if any other hostages are harmed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to play hardball; we have to carry a big stick, and we have to be 
selective and not harm innocent Lebanese citizens," he said. "We should warn 
Iran that if there is another act of violence against any hostage, they have 24 
hours before we torch El Kharj Island, their main oil-exporting center." 
</P>
<P>
Rewards for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the 
kidnapings, such as the bounty that resulted in the arrest and conviction of 
two men involved in the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship and the 
murder of an American passenger, also should be offered to gather information 
about the hostage-takers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Media Given Some Blame 
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is a poor country and people certainly would come forward with 
information," Jacobsen said. "Why in our Lord's name does the State Department 
refuse to authorize rewards for our hostages in Lebanon?" 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, who has delivered hundreds of speeches and given countless interviews 
about his ordeal and concerns for the remaining hostages, said the American 
media also shares the blame for the "devaluation" of the captives in Lebanon. 
Even though several of the captives were seized before the U.S. State 
Department advised all Americans to leave the country in January, 1987, he 
said, many U.S. citizens assume that the hostages acted recklessly and brought 
their predicament on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The media can do something they haven't done: create a public awareness of the 
hostages," he suggested. "Nobody knows who the hell Joe Cicippio is. Nobody 
knows who Tom Sutherland (dean of agriculture at American University when he 
was taken hostage in Beirut) is. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor Tom," Jacobsen said. "He's a good friend of mine who's been held for four 
years."

ARSON RULED TO BE CAUSE OF FIRE AT TUSTIN MEATPACKING PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-million fire that destroyed a 40-year-old meatpacking plant in the Old 
Town section of Tustin was caused by arson, fire officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 7,440-square-foot wooden building, which until recently had been the Old 
Tustin Meat Company, was "virtually destroyed" in the blaze that erupted about 
8 p.m. Sunday and burned until 1 a.m. Monday, according to Capt. Hank Raymond, 
a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire investigators have uncovered physical evidence indicating arson," Raymond 
said. Raymond would not say what material was used to start the blaze, only 
that it began in the rear of the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Was a Maze 
</P>
<P>
The fire was difficult to control because the building, which had stood at 200 
El Camino Real since the early 1940s, was a maze of added-on rooms and air 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"We would knock the fire down in one area, and it would crop up in another 
space," Raymond said. "The heat and smoke were so dense that you could only see 
one foot in front of your face." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 firefighters from the Orange County, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, 
Huntington Beach and Westminster fire departments battled the blaze, officials 
said. Cork-lined walls and cardboard boxes helped fuel the fire, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
At different times during the five-hour blaze, flames shot 30 feet into the 
sky. "We were concerned about embers coming down on structures a block away," 
Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the building was gutted, some machines had been covered with 
debris and were salvageable, Raymond said. The exact amount of damage may go 
over $1 million when a full inventory of the meat becomes known, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
No other structures were damaged, but one firefighter was slightly injured when 
a light fixture fell on him, according to Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
John Prescott, father of Tustin City Councilman Earl J. Prescott and a longtime 
Tustin resident, said the core of the building was an adobe structure built in 
1942 or 1943 as a meat locker for ranchers and local families during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significant Site 
</P>
<P>
When Tustin was a small farming community everyone had a freezer locker to keep 
meat, Prescott said. "I'd been in there hundreds of times." 
</P>
<P>
Earl Prescott said the City Council was considering naming the building a 
historically significant site. 
</P>
<P>
The meatpacking plant had been purchased about eight months ago by Steve 
Mendel, who was operating the Pacific Meat Co. in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials are asking that any one with information about who may have been 
responsible for the fire should call (714) 744-0505.

OFFICIALS ASK COUNCIL TO REMOVE MEMBER FROM TOLLWAY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two elected officials from outside Mission Viejo have written a confidential 
letter to the City Council asking that Councilman Robert A. Curtis, who faces a 
recall effort, be removed as the city's delegate to a county tollway agency's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the letter's authors -- Anaheim Councilman Thomas Daly and Fountain 
Valley Councilman George Scott -- sit on the board of the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency; however, Daly served with Curtis on a tollway 
agency finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
Marked "confidential," the letter was sent July 12 and charged that Curtis has 
been a "divisive force at our meetings. . . . We have been particularly 
dismayed by his attempts to press for personal press coverage . . . and his 
attempt (unseconded) to block repayment to the County of Orange for work done 
on the Corridor." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Councilman John C. Cox Jr., chairman of the San Joaquin Hills 
board, said that "in all fairness to Curtis, he's been dedicated in his 
efforts. . . . I don't have information that there's been a problem with his 
service at the transportation corridor agency." 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Hills Corridor is a planned 14-mile tollway linking Newport 
Beach and San Juan Capistrano through Irvine and Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Daly was a member of a sister panel, the board of the Eastern/Foothill 
Transportation Corridor Agency, but he quit before the July 12 letter was 
mailed. He said that he wrote the letter in his capacity as an Anaheim 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
In resigning from the agency's board, Daly cited a potential conflict of 
interest involving his new job as government affairs director for the county's 
Building Industry Assn., a group of landowners and builders who pay fees 
regulated by the tollway agencies to fund construction of the new roads. 
</P>
<P>
Daly and Curtis were both members of a joint finance committee that serves both 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who could not be reached for comment, is not a member of either 
tollway's board or staff. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis charged Monday that the letter from Daly and Scott is "just another part 
of the attempt by the Mission Viejo Co. to get me out of office." The Mission 
Viejo Co. is a member of the Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has previously alleged that the company is behind an attempt by a 
citizens' group to collect enough signatures by Sept. 28 to force Curtis into a 
recall election. The group -- and the Mission Viejo Co. -- have accused Curtis 
of using his position on the council to pursue personal interests, including an 
ill-fated attempt to annex the community of Aegean Hills. Curtis is a former 
resident of Aegean Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Daly acknowledged Monday that the July 12 letter was partly the result of 
conversations he had with Dave Celestin, the Mission Viejo Co.'s vice president 
for planning and governmental affairs. "It was the result of mutual 
discussions," he said. However, Daly denied that Celestin had asked him to 
write the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Celestin could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel said the firm has contributed used office equipment 
and the advice of political consultant Lynn Wessell -- worth about $1,000 
combined, she said -- to the recall committee. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo City Councilman Christian W. Keena, an attorney, said he does not 
expect the council to act on the July 12 letter until members, including 
himself, have had a chance to look into criticism of Curtis and confront him 
personally. Councilman Norman P. Murray has already asked Curtis to save the 
city money and resign rather than go through a recall election. But Mayor 
William S. Craycraft has supported the campaign opposing the recall.

DEVELOPERS JOIN FORCES TO MARKET OFFICE SPACE AS 'CENTRAPLEX' AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of local developers wants to give Orange County's most rapidly growing 
office area a fast-track name: Orange County Centraplex. 
</P>
<P>
Eight office developers said Monday that they would begin a coast-to-coast 
promotion to attract more business to a 30-square-mile section in the heart of 
the county, a section that takes in portions of Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden 
Grove and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The mostly developed area extends from Ball Road on the north to 1st Street on 
the south and from the Costa Mesa Freeway on the east to Euclid Street on the 
west. It contains a dozen or so high-rise buildings and is crisscrossed by five 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
It showed the highest rate of absorption -- newly occupied space -- in the 
county during the first half of 1989 as tenants moved into 616,000 square feet 
of new office space, according to a survey released last month by Grubb &amp; 
Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
But the area still has more than 3 million square feet of vacant space. 
Developers hope that the new name and some high-profile promotion will fill it 
all -- and create a need for 12.6 million square feet of planned space. 
</P>
<P>
The Centraplex group joins the Irvine Business Complex, founded in 1984 to 
cover the area near John Wayne Airport, and South Coast Metro, founded in 1983 
to cover the San Diego Freeway region that includes South Coast Plaza, as the 
third consortium of developers trying to name and then market a part of the 
county as a growth center. 
</P>
<P>
"This area looks like the Irvine Business Complex did five years ago," said 
Steve Spellman, a partner at Birtcher, who helped set up the group. "Buildings 
are going up so fast there that we have to start sharing some ideas about the 
kind of problems, like transportation, that we'll be facing." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group, which owns more than $1 billion in office space in the 
area, met several months ago with representatives of Caltrans to discuss 
widening the Santa Ana Freeway. They will continue to share ideas on the area's 
needs and develop an international marketing campaign, Spellman said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Birtcher of Laguna Niguel, other developers involved in the plan are 
the Huntington Seacliff Corp. of Huntington Beach, IDM Properties of Long 
Beach, Lincoln Property Co. of Los Angeles and Davis Developments, Hillman 
Properties, the Koll Co., and Nexus USA Equities, all in Newport Beach.

WESTERN DIGITAL SAYS LAST YEAR'S EARNINGS FELL 21%, SALES RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hampered by a computer industry slump and heavy losses in a new product line, 
Western Digital Corp. said Monday that its earnings fell 21% last year as the 
company narrowly missed the $1-billion sales mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based computer company earned $34.3 million for its fiscal year 
ended June 30, compared to earnings of $43.4 million in 1988. Sales rose 22%, 
to $992.1 million for the year, up from $768.3 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Western Digital's results were in line with expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"Western Digital has been warning us that this (fourth) quarter would be 
disappointing," said Benny Lorenzo, an analyst with Volpe &amp; Covington, a 
San Francisco investment firm. "Some analysts are frustrated with Western 
Digital, but they've done quite a bit to improve" the company's financial 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Not Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital Chairman Roger W. Johnson said the company had predicted higher 
earnings at the beginning of the fiscal year, "but overall, I'm not 
disappointed with where we ended up for the fourth quarter and year." 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital, the county's largest high-technology company, is a 
manufacturer of data storage devices and varied other components for the 
personal computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the company was hurt by sluggish sales of personal computers last 
year, which he partly attributed to a severe industrywide shortage of key 
computer memory chips in 1988 and early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the company's results were dampened by "several significant 
internal product and technology transitions." 
</P>
<P>
The company's heaviest losses resulted from sluggish growth in its 
"motherboard" business. Motherboards are memory boards on which chips are 
mounted for use inside personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Sluggish growth "cost us a lot of money during the year," said Johnson, 
attributing the losses to confusion in the industry over several competing 
computer design standards. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the market for another new product, an "integrated" computer disk 
drive for personal computers, also did not develop as quickly as expected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Products Profitable 
</P>
<P>
The losses from the motherboard and integrated-disk-drive products adversely 
affected the company's data storage, computer graphics and communications 
products, all of which were "very profitable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he looks for improved results for the current year: "We should 
have good solid improvement in revenues for the rest of this year, and profits 
should grow faster than revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter earnings fell to $4.3 million, down 70% from $14.7 million in 
the year-ago period. Sales were down 12%, to $243.5 million from the 
year-earlier quarter, and were essentially unchanged from the third quarter.

JUDGE OKS SALE OF IRVINE RANCH MARKET

A bankruptcy judge in Santa Ana has tentatively approved a $2.3-million sale of 
the Irvine Ranch Farmers Market store at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, 
lawyers involved in the case said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is one of the final steps to wrapping up the bankruptcy proceedings 
for what once was a trend-setting, upscale grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
Since filing for protection from creditors last July, the Costa Mesa-based 
company -- which started as a plywood shed along an Orange County road -- has 
closed or sold all seven of its stores in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Center store was bought by Chalet Ventures, a company headed by 
Daniel Bobroff, owner of Chalet Gourmet, a Hollywood gourmet grocery store. In 
the Irvine Ranch chain, which once consisted of 11 Southland stores, the 
Beverly Center market was the only one that consistently could cover its 
expenses, according to records filed in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
A group headed by Bobroff several months ago bought the Woodland Hills store 
that was the only other outlet in the chain to remain in business under the 
Irvine Ranch Farmers Market name. Bobroff will continue to operate the Beverly 
Center and Woodland Hills stores under the same name, an investment banker 
close to the deal said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1968 by Jon Hubbard, the Costa Mesa-based Irvine Ranch chain made a 
name throughout Southern California with its fancy produce and fresh meats. By 
early last year, the chain had expanded to 11 markets scattered from Northridge 
to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But in July, 1988, the chain was forced to file for federal bankruptcy court 
protection from its creditors. Documents filed in the case then listed 
liabilities of $17.5 million owed to more than 200 creditors, including 
vendors, lessors and institutional lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys involved in the case have blamed the chain's rapid expansion, 
extremely high rents and adverse publicity for its demise. At the same time, 
Irvine Ranch faced tough competition from other chains for affluent shoppers' 
grocery dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"You can walk into Vons or Albertson's these days and see the same polished 
apples . . . in 10 different varieties and displayed the same way" as at Irvine 
Ranch, said attorney William Lobel, whose firm represented the chain in the 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Bobroff's investment group entered the picture late last year, when Tribu Inc., 
the parent of Chalet Gourmet, bought Irvine Ranch's stock and took control of 
the ailing chain. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the group intended to operate the entire Irvine Ranch chain, 
Bobroff said Monday in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
But after four months, "our analysis indicated that even with a substantial 
additional cash and effort infusion, the stores would never be profitable," 
Bobroff said. He cited increased competition, occupancy costs and the markets' 
locations and sizes as reasons why the chain would never prosper. 
</P>
<P>
The Bobroff group began selling off assets or, in some cases, returning store 
sites to landlords. Today, all except the Beverly Center and Woodland Hills 
stores have been closed or sold. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the flagship, $4-million store in the Fashion Island shopping 
center in Newport Beach was acquired by the Irvine Co., which made deals with 
existing vendors and reopened as Farmers Market at Atrium Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa store was sold to Gary Canter Associates and remains open as the 
Original Irvine Ranch. The Irvine store was sold and renamed Gibsons Food 
Emporium. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange, the store was sold to Pacific Ranch Market. The Tustin site was sold 
and renamed Tustin's Farmers Market. The Yorba Linda store closed, then was 
resold to a Riverside grocery. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo store was closed. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan approved the sale of the Beverly Center store 
to Chalet Ventures several weeks ago, when no other buyers surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ryan still must sign his order approving the sale. Case attorneys also 
must submit a distribution plan, which will have to be approved by the court. 
After that, secured creditors should receive payment within 60 days, said Roger 
Ferree, attorney for Kroger Co., the largest unsecured creditor, which is owed 
about $2 million and holds another $2 million in equity in the Irvine Ranch 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the sale of the Beverly Center store will be used to pay some 
secured creditors and administrative claims against the Irvine Ranch chain. The 
secured claims total at least $2,219,850, said Ron Rus, attorney for the 
unsecured creditors. Unsecured creditors, who are owed about $17.5 million, 
will receive nothing, Rus said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is, there were never any assets. The apparent assets 
were illusive," Rus said Monday. "It just wasn't a viable entity."

RESALE HOMES REMAIN AFFORDABLE FOR 13%

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of county households that can afford to buy a median-priced, 
single-family resale house held steady in June at 13%, unchanged from May, the 
California Assn. of Realtors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The median-priced house sold for $251,674 in June, which meant that a household 
needed a minimum annual income of $85,789 to buy and faced monthly payments of 
$2,145. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, when the median sales price was $208,094, 23% of the households 
could afford to buy, the group estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The CAR figures assume that home buyers pay the traditional 20% down payment 
and obtain a 30-year mortgage. The figures do not include new homes or 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of households statewide that could afford to buy a median-priced 
resale house in California increased in June for the first time in six months. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the state, 16% of all households could buy, up from 15% in May. The 
median-priced, single-family resale house in California sold for $200,445 in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
A household needed a minimum annual income of $68,326 to qualify for a mortgage 
on such a dwelling and faced monthly payments of $1,708, including property 
taxes and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
AFFORDABILITY INDEX FOR EXISTING HOMES 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen percent of Orange County households could afford to buy the 
median-priced resale home in the county in June, compared to 13% in May and 23% 
in June, 1988.

HOW JASON TURNED GORE INTO GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Pictures once treated its "Friday the 13th" movies the way some folks 
might treat an eccentric aunt: carefully. And not without some embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Except for TV ad campaigns targeted at the movies' youthful core audience, 
promotion was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity materials heralding the studio's upcoming product often failed to 
mention the latest installment of the saga. 
</P>
<P>
It was as if Paramount didn't want to acknowledge its association with a film 
series about a supernatural psycho named Jason who wears a trademark hockey 
mask and does away with unsuspecting teen-agers at a place called Camp Crystal 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
But Paramount's not hiding in the shadows anymore, especially this time around. 
The "Friday the 13th" films have become too hot a franchise to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: The series' first seven films have combined domestic grosses of more 
than $200 million. That's a lot of gross considering that these movies are made 
on shoestring budgets. The first one nine years ago cost $600,000; this year's 
entry was just more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Given that kind of moneymaking potential in what has already been a 
record-breaking summer, there's no wonder Paramount is now on the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Its release last week of "Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan" in 
1,673 theaters is flanked by a wickedly clever ad campaign that makes the most 
of this latest entry's gimmick: Jason's first "visit" to New York. 
</P>
<P>
As publicity materials for the film proclaim, expect Jason to "take a bloody 
bite out of the Big Apple." 
</P>
<P>
The same publicity press kit finds Paramount at last touting the film series 
for what it is: a monster money-maker -- "one of the most successful in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Not mentioned is the fact that Jason has, these days, got some stiff 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Notably Freddy Krueger, the unlikely genre superstar who emerged from New Line 
Cinema's "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. 
</P>
<P>
The last Freddy entry grossed nearly $50 million. "A Nightmare on Elm Street V: 
The Dream Child" is also expected to do scary business when it is released 
nationwide Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount is taking full advantage of Jason's two-week jump on Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
To kick off the film's opening, Jason himself visited Arsenio Hall's talk show 
-- which is, coincidentally, produced by Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Because Jason's the silent type (the character does not speak), Hall did all 
the talking -- while glancing nervously at the ax Jason clutched in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, current ad copy depicts a knife-brandishing Jason looming large over 
Manhattan -- accompanied by the warning, "New York has a new problem." 
</P>
<P>
This follows up an original campaign that found Jason hacking his way through 
the famed "I Love N.Y." logo -- and peering through the logo's shredded heart. 
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized use of the New York logo brought threats of litigation from 
the New York State Department of Economic Development, which oversees the 
symbol's use. Paramount has since abandoned use of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
For the uninitiated: Jason (real name: Jason Voorhees) is a virtually 
unstoppable monster who cannot be reasoned with. 
</P>
<P>
That "indiscriminate nature -- the fact that everyone's fair game" may be one 
of the reasons for the character's appeal, says Rob Hedden, writer/director of 
"Part VIII." (See accompanying story.) 
</P>
<P>
As Hedden notes, Jason -- unlike Freddy Krueger -- doesn't dish out campy 
dialogue. "He's more your hard-core monster." The fact that he's "fairly 
indestructible" gives film makers considerable creative license. Says Hedden: 
"I remember asking the producers, 'Is it OK if I kill Jason?' They said, 'Sure, 
go ahead. No problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
Adds Hedden: "You know he's been dead for years -- right?" 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jason was "dead" when he made his screen debut in the original "Friday 
the 13th" in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham (who had done the notorious 1972 
slasher film, "Last House on the Left"), "Friday the 13th" was made for about 
$600,000. To find potential backers, Cunningham took out an ad in Variety. 
</P>
<P>
When Paramount picked up the film for distribution, it became the first major 
studio to acknowledge the box-office possibilities of the gore genre over the 
run-of-the-mill terror movies. 
</P>
<P>
(Four of the sequels have been produced or associate-produced by Frank Mancuso 
Jr., the son of Paramount Chairman Frank G. Mancuso Sr.) 
</P>
<P>
Virtually devoid of artsy pretense, the original film was a "showcase" for 
grisly effects -- including impalings and decapitations -- involving the deaths 
of unsuspecting teen-agers who were spending their summer at Camp Crystal Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Released on May 9, 1980, in 700 theaters, "Friday the 13th" grossed $39.7 
million domestically -- making it the summer's second-biggest moneymaker after 
"The Empire Strikes Back." 
</P>
<P>
"Friday the 13th" set off a land-rush of gore movies. Gore was in. So were 
calendar-killer movies, including "Prom Night," "Happy Birthday to Me," 
"Graduation Day," "Mother's Day" and "My Bloody Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
The "Friday the 13th" sequels were inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, these films are made with nonunion crews and under title 
pseudonyms. For instance, "VIII" was known as "Ashes to Ashes." During its 
production, Paramount representatives denied knowing that it was the next 
"Friday the 13th." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, the "Friday the 13th" saga goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Friday the 13th Part II" (1981): Jason returns to avenge his mother's 
death. Among the special-effects highlights: a spear through two bodies and 
death by machete, pike and chain saw, among other things. Domestic gross: $21.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Friday the 13th Part III" (1982): Jason knocks off more kids at Camp 
Crystal, this time in 3-D. Domestic gross: $36.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter" (1984): After causing more deaths, 
Jason is chopped up by a child (who's a monster-movie fanatic) named Tommy. The 
film climaxes with Tommy seeming to have somehow become Jason. Domestic gross: 
$32.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Friday the 13th: A New Beginning" (1985): Tommy is now 18 and 
institutionalized. Then comes a series of murders. Is Tommy to blame? Has Jason 
returned? Is there a third party emulating Jason? Domestic gross: $21.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives" (1986): Tommy's in for a surprise . 
. . an encounter with you-know-who. This one's "highlights" include a bare fist 
thrust through a stomach and a 360-degree head spin. Domestic gross: $19.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood" (1988): Jason encounters Tina, a 
teen with telekinesis. Has he met his match? Domestic gross: $19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The "Friday the 13th" legend also lives on weekly -- in a syndicated-TV 
anthology series. Produced by Paramount, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The "Friday the 13th" films have showcased more than spectacular -- albeit 
gruesome -- effects (which have since made their way into mainstream 
offerings). 
</P>
<P>
They've helped to launch a number of performers. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bacon was one of the camp counselors in the original film. And Corey 
Feldman was Tommy -- the kid who thinks he's Jason -- in "The Final Chapter" 
and "A New Beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Other series "graduates" include Crispin Glover ("The Final Chapter"), Amy 
Steel ("Part II"), Ron Palillo ("Part IV") and rocker Alice Cooper ("Part VI"). 
</P>
<P>
Sean S. Cunningham has since directed a number of genre titles -- including 
"House." Steve Miner, who directed "II" and "III," is supervising producer of 
ABC's "The Wonder Years." Tom Savini, who did the effects for the original 
film, became an effects superstar and is scheduled to direct a remake of "Night 
of the Living Dead." 
</P>
<P>
As for Jason: 
</P>
<P>
He has been played by seven actors. Stunt coordinator/stuntman/actor Kane 
Hodder -- the latest Jason -- has played him twice. (He also did the honors in 
"Part VII.") 
</P>
<P>
His portrait hangs in the hallways of the Paramount studio -- along with those 
of Eddie Murphy, the stars of the "Godfather" films, and historic Paramount 
players like Valentino, Gloria Swanson, Gary Cooper and Hope and Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
As Barry London, president of distribution and marketing, puts it: "He's a 
member of the Paramount family. Yes, we're proud of his movies." 
</P>
<P>
Jason was, after all, someone only a mother could love.

THEATER AND FILM / JAN HERMAN: LABOR CRISIS MAY WIPE OUT SCR 'SEARCH AND 
DESTROY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As the deadline nears for a strike by the Society of Stage Directors and 
Choreographers against South Coast Repertory and other members of the League of 
Resident Theaters, leaders of the Costa Mesa company face an increasingly 
delicate situation. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast has already taken ads announcing that David Chambers will direct 
the world premiere of Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy" on the Mainstage 
next season, yet Chambers himself is unwilling to say that he will take the 
assignment -- despite a long-term commitment to SCR and the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
"Should push come to shove, I don't know what I will do," said Chambers, who 
regularly stages plays at Yale Repertory and teaches at the Yale Drama School. 
</P>
<P>
"I do know that LORT's refusal of SSDC's last offer was an insult," he said 
about the League of Resident Theaters and the Society of Stage Directors and 
Choreographers. "I feel that way, and I know many other directors do, as well." 
</P>
<P>
The union has called for higher wages and greater coverage of small theaters 
than the league has been willing to accept. If a negotiated settlement is not 
reached by Aug. 8, the union has said it will promulgate its own contract and 
ask individual theaters to sign or face a strike. 
</P>
<P>
David Emmes, South Coast Repertory's producing artistic director, has said he 
will not accept a promulgated contract. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, who staged "Golden Girls" last season on the Mainstage, pointed out 
that he is active within the union and would have been on the union's 
negotiating panel except for a scheduling conflict. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he has forged such close ties to SCR that Emmes and artistic 
direct Martin Benson invited him to be one of their chief artistic advisers a 
few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants a strike," Chambers said last week from his summer home in Maine. 
"It's just not in anybody's interest. But all you can say at this point is that 
I'm playing chicken. David and Martin and I have talked about this, and we've 
agreed it's all pending." 
</P>
<P>
Although "Search and Destroy" is not scheduled to open until January, 
pre-production work would have to begin by October. Chambers directed a staged 
reading of the play at SCR earlier this year and has been helping playwright 
Korder develop the script. 
</P>
<P>
THE LEGS HAVE IT: Any questions about the drawing power of "Gypsy" or the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center's ability to sell single tickets to a 
Broadway show were answered by the box office gross for the revival's two-week 
run, which closed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Gypsy" drew $707,000 in its first week and $494,000 in its second, for a total 
of $1.2 million, topping the show's two-week gross of $781,000 at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles by more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first week at the Center had a subscription audience, the second 
week did not. "Gypsy's" run at the Pavilion had no subscriptions. The Center's 
first-week gross was not only the highest on the road so far for "Gypsy," but 
the second nearly matched the $501,000 second week in Los Angeles, despite a 
significant weakening factor. 
</P>
<P>
Because "Gypsy" had to leave early for Houston, the show could not be 
programmed at the Center on Sunday. This meant substituting a Thursday matinee 
for the Sunday matinee, which is usually the second-strongest box office 
performance of the week after Saturday night, according to Center officials. It 
also meant programming the show for a normally dark Monday night, to substitute 
for Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the two fill-in shows did the worst business of the engagement -- 
40% of capacity for Monday and 38% for Thursday's matinee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could have done another $100,000 in the second week if we'd had our 
regular schedule," Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that Tyne Daly called in sick Monday, although it didn't hurt 
much. Kendrick said there were just a handful of cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Center sold $650,000 worth of single tickets over both weeks. 
</P>
<P>
UNCOMMON MIZ: Just when you thought "Les Miz" was gone forever (after 59 weeks 
at the Schubert Theatre in Los Angeles), it will make an appearance in Orange 
County -- but without the music. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, the Victor Hugo novel has been adapted as a stage play. Robert 
Michael Conrad is directing it at Corona del Mar's Newport Beach Center, where 
it opens Friday, in a Coastline Community College production. 
</P>
<P>
"I admit I chose 'Les Miserables' with trepidation," he said. "But a 
non-musical allows us to get back to the whole point of the novel. It fills in 
many pieces of the story that the musical didn't touch." 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, 34, an associate professor of theater arts, has been trying to focus 
attention on Coastline's small theater department in the last year by mounting 
plays not commonly seen around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer he produced a stage adaptation of Joseph Heller's "Catch-22," 
followed in the fall by Ray Bradbury's "The Martian Chronicles." He also plans 
to have a non-musical version of "The Phantom of the Opera" up and running in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Les Miserables," he said the Coastline production will put a spin on 
the relationships of the principal characters -- Jean Valjean, Cosette, 
Fantine, Inspector Givert and others -- that may surprise theatergoers who have 
seen the Tony-winning musical. 
</P>
<P>
"Much as I liked that show, it was sketchy," Conrad said. "Our scenes are much 
stronger dramatically because we do not have to deal with songs." 
</P>
<P>
WILLKOMEN: It looks like the long-delayed UCI Cabaret to showcase the 
university's hottest musical acts has finally found an off-campus home at the 
Hotel Laguna in Laguna Beach. Come October, you will be able to catch them 
Monday nights for nothing more than the price of a drink. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unique for a School of Fine Arts," said Eli Simon, a member of the UCI 
theater department who will run the cabaret with Dennis Castellano of the music 
department. "We'll provide the entertainment, and the hotel will provide the 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Simon envisions the cabaret as a "real-world" forum for top student performers. 
It will be either in the hotel's lounge or in Claes, the hotel restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"The performers will be able to audition material and get needed experience in 
front of a general audience," Simon said. "Once people hear about us, this 
thing will fly. We've got some great talent." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cunningham, sales director of the hotel, confirmed the cabaret plans: "It's 
definitely going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
No specific date in October has been scheduled for the opening, however. 
</P>
<P>
RETRO LAGUNA: Most people would not admit to aiming for "the graphic equivalent 
of 'Pee-wee's Playhouse.' " But Jody Davidson, general manager of the Laguna 
Playhouse, said "that's what kids are into now," so she decided the new Youth 
Theatre catalogue should go retro. 
</P>
<P>
The result, designed by Davidson and the Art Institute of Southern California 
in Laguna Beach, is a smash hit. It has pulled more than 500 subscription 
responses in three weeks. "That's already half the number we had last year," 
Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue for the playhouse's 1989-90 season has gone out as well. It ought 
to keep the theater company's adult fans equally amused. The brochure is 
breezy, imaginative and fun to look at. Credit Greg Miller, who teaches at the 
institute.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
A headline in Monday's Calendar incorrectly stated that a stage directors' 
strike could disrupt the world premiere of Howard Korder's "Search and 
Destroy," scheduled for January at South Coast Repertory Theatre in Costa Mesa. 
In an interview, David Chambers, who is to direct the play, said he does not 
know whether he will take the assignment if the Society of Stage Directors and 
Choreographers calls a strike against the League of Resident Theatres, of which 
South Coast is a member. Theater officials said that "Search and Destroy" will 
be staged as scheduled, with or without Chambers.

'FOCUS EAST' IS SOMETIMES POSED, OFTEN EXTRAORDINARY

<P>
Ah, the romance of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Four exotic-looking female "orange merchants" pose sensuously for the camera 
behind shallow wicker baskets laden with fruit. One woman, most of her face 
veiled, balances four plump oranges in a pyramid on her palm. 
</P>
<P>
The image is redolent of a region that, despite violent strife, still resonates 
on many levels as a home of fabulous sheiks, Arabs on camels, seductive women, 
the biblical Holy Land and the seat of Western civilization. 
</P>
<P>
This romantic image was even more pronounced in the Western world during the 
mid-19th Century, when a vogue in Middle Eastern culture erupted, especially in 
Europe. Fueled in part by countries such as France and Great Britain, which 
sought to expand their empires in the region, and by the engineering of the 
Suez Canal, attention focused on this portion of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of professional and amateur photographers descended to practice their 
new craft as governments commissioned surveys of the region, the people and its 
historic landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
English, French, Italian, Spanish and German commercial photographers found a 
ready market in Europe for their images of the Middle East. Tourists also tried 
their hands at the bulky early cameras.

The Mideast afforded a proving ground for photography, which dates from 1839, 
as thousands of images were made to feed a ravenous hunger for information 
about this fabled land. 
</P>
<P>
"Focus East: Early Photography in the Middle East, 1839-1885," is a huge -- 
even daunting -- exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Photographic Arts that 
offers more than 200 images from this period. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, organized by Nissan Perez, curator of photography for the Israel 
Museum in Jerusalem, opened at that museum in 1988. The extensive show offers 
many 19th-Century views of much of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
We see boatloads of European visitors being rowed ashore, arriving in fancy 
carriages at a hotel, or "roughing it" in tents in the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
Subjects range from religious sites such as the Jordan River, the Via Dolorosa 
and the Garden of Gethsemane, to Egyptian landmarks such as the Pyramid of 
Cheops and the myriad Mideast people. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most beautiful of the pictures is titled "First Cataract of the 
Nile," by Ottoman photographer J. Pascal Sebah. Sebah positioned his camera 
right at the river's edge. Because the shutter speed was too slow to stop the 
action of the river, the image is of a blurred, foamy torrent flying over the 
rocky bed. 
</P>
<P>
In researching the exhibition, Perez concluded that most of the European 
photographers romanticized the Middle East and that different nationalities 
portrayed the region differently. The images on view bear him out. 
</P>
<P>
The English photographers had a more restrained view, maintaining a cool 
distance from Middle Easterners. The French concentrated on the romance of the 
region, and tended to set up photographs that fit with fictional literary 
accounts of the region. Those photographers who are near to or from the region, 
such as Sebah, gave a more accurate picture of the common people. 
</P>
<P>
However, some key information about the images that Perez ferreted out during 
the six years he spent organizing the show is not on the walls but in a $50 
book. For instance, he notes in the book that a man identified in an 1875 
picture as the chief rabbi of Jerusalem is the same figure recorded by 
Frenchman Felix Bonfils as a common laborer. Bonfils and others, he said, 
resorted to models to give waiting Europeans the pictures they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of images by Italian and French photographers were supposedly 
captured "live," such as the orange merchants by Italian Carlo Naya, they are 
actually posed tableaux vivants. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the exhibit has many exquisite images. Armenian photographer G. 
Likegian captured the still beauty of a group of minarets. Louis de Clercq's 
"View of the New Bridge" in Tripoli is a soothing inner-city landscape showing 
the comfortable arches of the bridge, the soft curve of the winding river and 
buildings stacked up a distant hill. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the exhibit's subject matter, its awesome size and Americans' 
reportedly limited knowledge of geography, a couple of additions could aid the 
weary museum visitor. A large map of the Mideast, marking the names of the 
places photographed, would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Benches to allow viewers to rest during their trek through the scores of 
photographs would be appreciated also. In the absence of places to sit in the 
museum, a suggestion: Viewers may wish to take a quick spin through the show to 
acclimate themselves, get a cup of coffee, think about what they have seen, 
then dive back in again. 
</P>
<P>
"Focus East" continues through Sept. 10 at the Museum of Photographic Arts in 
Balboa Park.

More than 50,000 rock fans celebrated the final day of a congress of 
Mozambique's ruling party Sunday in Maputo's National Stadium with British 
rocker Eric Clapton. Clapton, heading a bill that included artists from Zaire 
and South Africa, kept the crowd on its feet while police and soldiers in 
fatigues patrolled the perimeter of the stadium. Scores of white South 
Africans, international aid workers and foreign embassy officials also attended 
the concert, which was a stop on the final leg of Clapton's Southern Africa 
tour. Observers said the crowd surpassed the turnout in September for Pope John 
Paul II. DANIEL CERONE

CONDUCTOR LOOKS FOR LIFE AFTER SOUSA, FINDS IT IN ITALY

In 1985, when pops conductor Keith Brion last visited San Diego, he did his 
John Philip Sousa impersonation for the San Diego Symphony's summer pops. 
Brion, a former orchestra piccolo player and Yale University bandmaster, has 
built his peripatetic conducting career around his historically accurate 
portrayal of the style and programming of "America's March King." 
</P>
<P>
"This whole Sousa thing began with a concert I conducted at Yale at 1978. I 
moved into this thing sideways," Brion said. "It was a huge success in New 
Haven, so I took the band to Carnegie Hall, where we got good reviews." 
</P>
<P>
Before Brion knew it, he had signed with an agent and quickly moved from band 
conducting to the more lucrative symphony pops circuit. After two years, he 
left Yale to pursue his new calling as the reincarnate Sousa. His work was 
aired on public television in 1986, a program called "The New Sousa Band at 
Wolf Trap," and he made two recordings of Sousa's music. 
</P>
<P>
But even Brion began to ask himself if there was life after Sousa, so he put 
together a news pops program, "Viva Italia!" 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to include the whole spectrum of Italian music," Brion said from his 
hotel in Salt Lake City, where he was doing Sousa again. "I wanted to include 
Italian opera, folk music -- particularly the Neapolitan folk tunes -- as well 
as modern Italian popular songs, including the glitzy 'Three Coins in a 
Fountain' side." 
</P>
<P>
Brion is also enthusiastic about the orchestral arrangements of Annunzio 
Mantovani. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the recorded versions of Mantovani's traditional Italian music, 
which, unlike much of his popular 'elevator music,' is done with particular 
sensitivity. His orchestrations for these Italian pieces always include 
accordion and guitar. The sound of the accordion is very evocative." 
</P>
<P>
Brion will bring "Viva Italia" to the SummerPops this week, Wednesday through 
Saturday. He will be joined by tenor Noel Velasco and soprano Charleen Ayers 
for the operatic arias and duets. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole goal was to find opera pieces that the opera lover will enjoy and the 
non-opera lover will find accessible. People like the big, heroic, Pavarotti 
voice. Velasco has the big voice, although not the Pavarotti girth." 
</P>
<P>
Velasco, who recently sang his Covent Garden debut, and Ayers are both students 
of American soprano Phyllis Curtin, who taught voice at Yale when Brion was 
also on the music faculty. Brion has conducted his all-Italian program for the 
Rochester Philharmonic in 1987 and for the San Jose Symphony last season. Not 
one to be accused of musical snobbery, he also does a pops program that is a 
tribute to the late Boston Pops maestro Arthur Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
"Sousa was a much more artful programmer than Fiedler," Brion said, "and 
Fiedler admitted it. I think Sousa would be in favor of San Diego's programming 
-- its mixture of light classic and novelties, things that are entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
They call it jukebox ballet. While the spirit of glasnost may have moderated 
the attitudes of American diplomats, members of San Diego's musicians union, 
Local 325, American Federation of Musicians, were not shy in expressing their 
distress over the visiting Bolshoi Ballet's Civic Theatre performances. Some 
half a dozen union members picketed several performances last week, complaining 
that the visiting Soviet ballet troupe was not using live music but taped 
instrumental accompaniment for its performances here. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Pallazola, president of Local 325, made it clear in a phone interview that 
his union's action was an informational picket and not a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not picketing against the Russians," he said. "We are not picketing 
against the people presenting this performance. We are picketing against the 
fact that people are more and more using canned music. People are paying the 
same price for tickets that they do for ballets backed with live music. This is 
a trend that has got to be stopped. People have got to realize they are not 
getting the same quality of (dance) performance without live music." 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo watch update. Fans of Chula Vista's most celebrated pianist, Gustavo 
Romero, will be delighted to learn than he will both conduct and perform at the 
International Orchestra's season-opening concert Nov. 17. While Romero left the 
San Diego area a decade ago to pursue his studies and build his career in New 
York City, he has returned regularly to perform both solo recitals and concert 
gigs. In fact, he appears here more frequently than any San Diego-based 
pianist. 
</P>
<P>
On the November program at Sherwood Auditorium in La Jolla, Romero will conduct 
the International Orchestra in Mozart's Symphony No. 29 in A Major, and will 
solo in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 27 in B Flat Major, with music director 
Zoltan Rozsnyai on the podium. In Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos in E-flat 
Major, Rozsnyai will join Romero in the solo duties at the second keyboard, 
allowing Romero to play and conduct the concerto. 
</P>
<P>
This concert will open the International Orchestra six-concert series in La 
Jolla. As in previous seasons, the orchestra will play a second series of four 
different concerts in San Diego's College Avenue Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
Zorro in the park. Theater organ hotshot Dennis James turned Balboa Park's 
Spreckels Organ into an outdoor movie palace last week. To a cheering audience 
of 2,300, James played a stirring accompaniment to Douglas Fairbanks' 1920 
silent movie classic, "The Mark of Zorro." No amount of swashbuckling idiocy on 
screen daunted James' clever, virtuoso playing. For the past two seasons, James 
and his crew have packed Symphony Hall in the San Diego Symphony's 
"Nickelodeon" silent film series. If you haven't heard James ply his trade, 
you've missed one of the minor wonders of the moderne age.

LO-TEC VIOLENCE, ANGST AND DARK, BROODING WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGOEILEEN SONDAK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Bolshoi Ballet Academy danced fanciful, fairy-tale ballets last 
weekend, two modern dance makers and a small band of dancers addressed darker 
themes in Three's Company's no-frills Hillcrest studio. 
</P>
<P>
The Lo-Tec concert featured works by Margaret Wingrove and Shawn Womack. 
Neither Wingrove nor Womack is an unknown quantity in modern dance. Wingrove 
(with a success at Jacob's Pillow to her credit) has had her own company in San 
Jose since 1981. And Womack (a recent NEA fellow in choreography) has a company 
that bears her name in Cincinnati. But both choreographers had low profiles in 
San Diego before debuting here last Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Wingrove's work and three dancers from her seven-member company dominated the 
performance. They executed five of the six pieces on the program, including 
"Shatterings," the emotionally-draining dance drama that had its world premiere 
at Saturday night's performance. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS-inspired dance works are becoming sadly commonplace as the deadly disease 
spreads. But Wingrove's perspective -- as the mother of a victim -- may be 
unique. In any case, her five-part dance drama was a moving tribute to friends 
and family of AIDS sufferers, not just the people afflicted with the vicious 
killer. And Wingrove got her message across without any heavy-handed imagery or 
sappy sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Howerton, a lithe, lanky dancer with cat-like lunges and strong 
technique, gave a shattering performance in the powerful "Why Me?" section. 
Juxtaposed against the mournful pluckings of a guitar, the deformed gestures of 
this tortured solo sent Howerton writhing. But he danced it with dignity and 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
The bleeding patterns of their tie-dyed costumes (credited to dancer Annette 
Williams) aided and abetted the spirit of the piece. Too bad the bare-bones 
studio setting could not provide the level of lighting the piece deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Violence and angst were pretty much the order of the day at this concert. A 
little balance would have served the choreographers and the audience a lot 
better. 
</P>
<P>
The performance opened on a downer with "Mind Trap," a trio for Howerton, 
Williams and Kerry Rapp. Flimsy vertical frames and a crudely executed fence 
were used as metaphors for the psychological walls that stifle the human 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Wingrove was too literal in her imagery and too preachy in her 
program notes. "Mind Trap" might have made a bigger impact without them. 
</P>
<P>
"Two Into One" sounded more hopeful than it was, but at least it fared much 
better as a dance work. As the electronic score pounded its dissonant 
accompaniment, Howerton and Rapp played with a destructive relationship -- yet 
another kind of entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
This could have been just another angst-filled twosome, but Wingrove made 
inventive use of props (a wooden chair and an open frame), then ended it all 
with a climax that completely caught the audience off balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Reflection" was another dance for a couple, this time for Howerton and 
Williams. The choreography was interesting and well danced by this well-matched 
pair, but Philip Glass' throbbing rhythms seemed out of step with the lyrical 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
"Early Sorrow," a solo for Rapp, never stooped to the maudlin in its "young 
girl's lament over the untimely death of her mother." Instead, it trusted the 
movement -- deep lunging leg lifts and rapid shifts in direction -- to tell the 
tale. And Rapp, with flowing hair and a beautifully supple spine, was a 
mesmerizing presence in this brief lament. 
</P>
<P>
Womack has been in residence here for weeks, teaching at workshops for local 
dancers. The piece she unveiled at this concert was a direct result of that 
residency and served as a vehicle for five Three's Company interns. It was the 
third such opportunity to come their way this summer, and the 
"work-in-progress" was an effective showcase for the emerging dancers. However, 
the program didn't need another dark, brooding work. Hopefully, things will 
lighten up a little, at least in the emotional sense, when Three's Company's 
Lo-Tec series resumes Aug. 12-13.

Robin Higgins called on her husband's captors today to "give us proof" of 
whether he is dead or alive. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Higgins, out of the public eye at the Pentagon, repeated through a 
spokeswoman that she had viewed the videotape of the purported execution of her 
husband, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, "It is impossible to make a definite determination on 
whether my husband is dead or alive." 
</P>
<P>
However, several Pentagon officials interviewed privately said they are acting 
on the assumption that the tape did show Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a few of us believe he's gone," said one official, who spoke on 
condition he not be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
The official said Robin Higgins has been "holding up well. She's a very strong 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokeswoman Army Maj. Kathy Wood relayed the comments from Robin 
Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my husband returned home," Robin Higgins was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
She also called on his captors to "give us proof of his condition," Wood said.

In a move potentially affecting future political power of individual states, 
the House blocked an effort today to bar the Census Bureau from counting 
illegal aliens during the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of an amendment to exclude illegal aliens said their numbers should 
not be used to determine the states' representation in the House. The 
Constitution provides that the 435 House seats are apportioned among the states 
based on their population as determined by the census. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was debated during consideration of the 1990 appropriation bill for 
the Department of Commerce, which includes the Census Bureau. Rep. Tom Ridge 
(R-Pa.) sought to offer an amendment prohibiting the counting of illegal 
aliens, but in a series of parliamentary maneuvers and votes his amendment was 
not allowed.

2ND HOSTAGE GETS 48-HOUR REPRIEVE AFTER WIFE'S PLEA;

The captors of American hostage Joseph Cicippio said today that they have 
postponed the "execution" of their captive for 48 hours, after an appeal for 
mercy by the hostage's wife. 
</P>
<P>
There was no word on the fate of British hostage Terry Waite, whose life also 
had been threatened by Lebanese extremists who demanded that Israel release a 
Hezbollah religious leader and two of his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
At an emotional news conference in East Beirut, Cicippio's Lebanese wife, 
Elham, pleaded with her husband's captors to spare his life. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage's wife, speaking in Arabic, burst into tears as she asked the 
kidnapers in the name of "all religious teachings and humanitarian principals 
to reconsider their decision on my husband who has always distanced himself 
from politics and politicians." 
</P>
<P>
She then addressed her husband directly in English: "Joe, I know the difficulty 
of the situation in which we are in, but all I ask you is to keep your hopes 
high and don't ever lose faith in God." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Touching Appeal' Cited 
</P>
<P>
Cicippio, 58, the American University of Beirut's deputy comptroller, was 
kidnaped Sept. 12, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Justice Organization, a faction of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, 
or Party of God, had threatened to kill Cicippio if Israel did not release 
Hezbollah leader Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid by 6 p.m. (8 a.m. PDT). 
</P>
<P>
But the group said in a statement delivered to the independent An Nahar 
newspaper at 8:15 p.m. (10:15 a.m. PDT): "Because of friendly and honest calls, 
some personal reasons and the touching appeal by Cicippio's wife, the 
organization announces that it postponed the execution for 48 hours, which 
(postponement) will not be valid for renewal." 
</P>
<P>
As a proof of authenticity, the statement was accompanied by a color close-up 
photograph showing Edward Tracy, another American hostage whom the group holds, 
who appeared whitebearded and wearing a dark blue sweater. 
</P>
<P>
The original threat against Cicippio was issued Monday several hours after 
another offshoot of Hezbollah, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, said 
it killed Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and released a videotape showing a 
man who appeared to be Higgins hanging from a gallows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Meeting 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush met with his top military and national security 
advisers at the White House today to discuss possible responses to the hostage 
crisis, but there was no immediate word on any plans for retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins was among 17 foreigners, including nine Americans, believed held in 
Lebanon, most by factions of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah organization. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone caller saying he represented those holding Church of England envoy 
Waite threatened today to kill him at midnight (2 p.m. PDT) if Israel refused 
to release Obeid, a Hezbollah leader believed to be the mastermind of the 
Higgins kidnaping and other terrorist acts. 
</P>
<P>
Today's threat against Waite, which came in a telephone call to the Voice of 
the Nation radio station in Muslim West Beirut, was the second in less than 24 
hours. The previous call was made to the Associated Press office in Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Neither threat against Waite could be authenticated.

Soviet ideology officials sought this week to halt publication in Moscow of the 
memoirs of Nikita S. Khrushchev, but editors fought back and won clearance to 
continue, the late Kremlin leader's son said today. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Khrushchev reported the censorship bid in a speech at the opening of the 
first major exhibition to be staged in the Soviet Union on the 10 years from 
1954 to 1964 when his father was the country's uncontested No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was not convenient at this stage to publish the memoirs and made 
clear they would not give sanction for any further extracts to appear," said 
the 53-year-old engineer, himself writing a book about Khrushchev. 
</P>
<P>
But Vitaly Korotich, editor-in-chief of the weekly Ogonyok, which has published 
extracts from the memoirs for the past month, and editors of other journals 
planning to run longer versions insisted that they had to go ahead, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Khrushchev, who told visitors to the exhibition that he had helped his 
father record his recollections after his removal from power in 1964, said 
officials had cited a Kremlin decision of 1977 for their action. 
</P>
<P>
The memoirs were printed in Western countries in the '70s.

Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak's bid to be prime minister ran into difficulty today 
after Solidarity declared its opposition to him and the Communist coalition 
acknowledged that it is divided. 
</P>
<P>
Across Poland today, food prices soared by up to 500%, the bitter cost of the 
government's swift push toward a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity free trade union, called for opposition 
lawmakers in Parliament's lower house, or Sejm, to vote against Kiszczak, the 
ruling Communist Party's nominee for prime minister. His brief statement was 
issued just minutes before the lawmaking body was to meet to consider the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
However, after a series of consultations in Parliament, it was decided to 
postpone Kiszczak's nomination and debate on his candidacy at least until 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist-allied Peasant Party, whose 76 votes are needed to give the 
Communist delegation a working majority of lawmakers, did not announce its 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
After battling on Monday to snap up goods at the old prices, long-suffering 
Poles bore the unprecedented hikes with resignation. 
</P>
<P>
When shops opened today they found a loaf of bread had more than doubled in 
price to 200 zloties (24 cents) while milk cost 180 zloties (22 cents) a 
bottle, four times the old price. 
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous but what can we do?" shrugged one pensioner at Warsaw's 
Koszykowa market.

Photo, Legend of the Lost -- The U.S. Consulate in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 
believes that Haile Maria Gadessa and his sister, Tegest, are two white 
children who were abducted or abandoned 20 years ago and raised by a tribal 
family. Consul Carol Rose said she believes the two "are telling the truth as 
they know it," but there is little the U.S. government can do. She says their 
skin has been bronzed and features distorted by constant exposure to the sun.

SENATE ENDORSES PLAN TO MAKE MX MISSILES MOBILE

The Senate today endorsed President Bush's plan for making MX nuclear missiles 
mobile, rejecting a proposal to slash $502 million from the Administration's 
$1.1-billion request for the weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
On a 62-38 vote, the Senate turned aside an amendment that would have trimmed 
the funds earmarked for placing the existing 50 MX missiles on railroad cars -- 
a budget-cutting step the House took last week. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have that kind of unraveling over here, we go to conference with a 
totally illogical, unsound program . . . and I believe that will be detrimental 
to both our national security and our arms control," Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), 
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said as the Senate resumed 
consideration of its version of the $295-billion fiscal 1990 defense bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stealth Program Criticized 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also approved, 93 to 7, a non-binding resolution expressing the 
sense of the chamber that "it is not presently prudent or possible to commit to 
the procurement of an operational force" of B-2 Stealth bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers have criticized the plan to build 132 of the radar-evading planes at 
a cost of $70 billion, or $530 million per plane. 
</P>
<P>
The House last week voted to strictly limit the Stealth program in fiscal 1990, 
pressing the Pentagon to come up with a cheaper program. But the Senate kept 
the Administration's program relatively intact, making a modest cut of $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the B-2 resolution today were Sens. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), James A. McClure (R-Ida.), 
Don Nickels (R-Okla.) and Steve Symms (R-Ida.).

<P>
The House today voted to give an antitrust exemption to the TV industry so it 
can try to adopt voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing violent programming. 
</P>
<P>
The 399-18 vote sent the measure to the Senate, which passed a similar bill May 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would give television networks, local stations, producers and the 
cable TV industry a three-year antitrust exemption to work up guidelines for 
depicting non-news violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
At present, such discussions would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, which 
caused the demise of previous industry self-regulation under the Television 
Code of the National Assn. of Broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate version of the bill was approved with an amendment by Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) that would also allow the TV industry to discuss ways to curb 
scenes that glorify drug use and portray sexually explicit material.

The Egyptian government has commissioned a Dutch-Egyptian engineering 
consultancy consortium to conduct a study into the feasibility of expanding the 
Suez Canal, a spokesman for the consortium said today. 
</P>
<P>
Financial Manager Peter Steenbergen of the Dutch engineering consultancy bureau 
NEI said the Arab Fund will pay for the 18-month study. Steenbergen said the 
plan is aimed at enabling ships of up to 270,000 dead weight tons to pass 
through the canal, compared with the current maximum of 150,000 dwt., and to 
deepen the waterway to 67 feet from 56 feet.

In anticipation of the change, last-minute shoppers packed a central Jakarta

The store was deserted today. Master copies of pirated software were locked

JUNE CONSTRUCTION SPENDING DOWN 0.8% TO LOWEST LEVEL IN 8 MONTHS

<P>
Construction spending in June slumped 0.8% to its lowest level in eight months 
as declines in housing and government projects offset a gain in commercial 
building, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Residential, non-residential and public projection activity fell to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.7 billion, the lowest level since 
October, the report said. The decline followed a 0.6% gain in May and a 0.8% 
drop in April. 
</P>
<P>
Activity for the first six months of the year was only 2.9% above the same 
period in 1988, an increase that doesn't even make up for the 4.8% rise in 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
Economists have been expecting construction to be weak this year because of the 
Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign, which ended in the spring, to fight 
inflation with higher interest rates. Since early June, the central bank has 
reversed course, allowing interest rates to decline modestly, and analysts now 
expect construction to rebound at least a bit.

NAACP INVESTIGATING SUSPENSION OF ATHLETES;

PURDUE PUNISHES BLACK FOOTBALL PLAYERS AFTER FIGHT WITH WHITES, WHO WERE NOT

An NAACP chapter says it is looking into the suspension of six black football 
players at Purdue University in connection with a March 18 brawl with members 
of the school's wrestling team. 
</P>
<P>
The six football players were punished, but the three wrestlers, who are white, 
were not disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that the six football players were treated unfairly," said Carl 
Briscoe, the chairman of the Political Action Committee of the Lafayette 
chapter of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
"Only six football players were identified and disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Ineligible to Play 
</P>
<P>
Four of the players -- guards Scott Conover and Larry Taylor, defensive back 
Tony Brown and tight end Kelly Turner -- were suspended for the fall semester, 
making them ineligible for the 1989 season. All are appealing their suspensions 
and hope to learn their fate before practice begins Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backs Steve Jackson and Jarrett Scales were suspended for the summer 
semester and are eligible this season. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl occurred at a party in an on-campus house where three Purdue 
wrestlers and three non-athletes lived. An argument between a football player 
and a wrestler escalated into a fight in a nearby parking lot, Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
The football players left but returned to retrieve a jacket. When they 
re-entered the house, officials said, the altercation again erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Briscoe said the wrestlers struck the football players with bottles, punched 
them in the face and taunted them with racial slurs. But a witness said that 
the football players returned to the party with sticks and that one of them 
broke the jaw of the brother of one of the wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police File No Charges 
</P>
<P>
Local police filed no formal charges. The incident led to on-campus hearings by 
the dean of students' office in April. 
</P>
<P>
"Each individual student complained of racial, derogatory and ethnic statements 
of personal character," Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not suggesting that the football players are innocent but were treated 
unfairly. It takes two to fight." 
</P>
<P>
Purdue's vice president for university relations, Joe Bennett, said race was 
not an issue in the disciplining of the football players.

Tour de France winner Greg LeMond wants to leave the Belgian ADR cycling team 
after receiving a "phenomenal" offer from the 7-Eleven team in the United 
States, his team director said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jose de Cauwer said that LeMond wants to break his contract, which does not 
expire until the end of next year, but that ADR has yet to decide whether to 
allow the American to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"If he desperately wants to go, there are two possibilities. Either we tell him 
to stay and we start quarreling or we agree to let him go by mutual agreement," 
De Cauwer told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
De Cauwer said 7-Eleven had made LeMond the highest offer ever made to a rider, 
which ADR could never match. 
</P>
<P>
"They are ready to pay him a phenomenal sum, and they are prepared to go to the 
bitter end," De Cauwer said. He declined to specify details of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond and his lawyers visited International Professional Cycling Federation 
President Hein Verbruggen on Monday to discuss ways of terminating the 
contract, but Verbruggen said it would not be possible, De Cauwer said.

Former Washington Redskins General Manager Bobby Beathard was offered a job 
with the San Diego Chargers last week but turned the offer down, the San Diego 
Union said today. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard, who will work for NBC as a football analyst this fall, resigned from 
the Redskins earlier this year and moved to the San Diego County beach 
community of Leucadia. Beathard has described his move as a break from 
football, sparking speculation that he would someday become an executive for 
the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't say several, but a few teams -- four or so -- have called," 
Beathard told the newspaper. "My mood was pretty much the same concerning all 
of those calls. Being in the National Football League is exciting. It's fun. 
But it's not what I'm looking for right now." 
</P>
<P>
Chargers owner Alex Spanos said he offered Beathard a position last week but 
that the specifics of the job were not outlined. He told the Union that 
Beathard would have been working with Steve Ortmayer, director of football 
operations.

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo says Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose should make 
baseball's Hall of Fame regardless of whether he bet on baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
"What if he had six wives who said he was a boor and he died an alcoholic?" 
asked Cuomo, a former minor league baseball player and avid fan. "Character 
becomes a very elusive criteria. How do you measure it? When do you choose to 
use that criteria?" 
</P>
<P>
Rose, baseball's all-time hit leader, would be banned from baseball if he is 
found to have bet on his own teams. Even if he is banned, Rose could still be 
elected to the Hall of Fame. As the Rose case proceeds through the courts, the 
debate continues over whether he should be allowed into the hall if the 
allegations are true. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to define what the Hall of Fame is," said Cuomo, who played 
briefly in the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system. "If the Hall of Fame is for 
baseball players who were great baseball players, I'd put him in the Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"Whose face is up on the mountain, Jefferson?" added Cuomo, referring to Mt. 
Rushmore. "He had a mistress."

Alexander Spitzer -- The Times reported incorrectly Monday that Inglewood 
lender Alexander Spitzer controls several industrial loan companies. The 
appropriate term for Spitzer's firms is not industrial loan companies, but 
finance companies. Finance companies, or "hard-money lenders," are less 
regulated than thrift and loans, which take deposits from the public in the 
form of investment certificates. Both are licensed by the state.
