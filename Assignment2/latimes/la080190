HUMAN GENE THERAPY TEST RECEIVES KEY U.S. APPROVAL 
</P>

<P>
A key federal advisory panel Tuesday approved two ground-breaking research 
experiments involving the first use of human gene therapy in this country to 
treat life-threatening disease, including an often-fatal type of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is truly an historic occasion," said Gerard J. McGarrity, chairman of the 
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health, which 
evaluated and approved the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The experiments must also be endorsed by the NIH director and the Food and Drug 
Administration, but their approval is considered a virtual certainty. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step toward developing treatments that do not now exist for 
incurable diseases," said Dr. W. French Anderson of the National Heart, Lung 
and Blood Institute, a lead researcher on the projects. "There is a whole range 
of diseases that can be affected, the most immediately obvious being genetic 
diseases and cancer. Right behind them are AIDS and cardiovascular diseases." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed tests represent a milestone in genetic research. In the 
experiments, normal genes developed in a laboratory will be inserted into the 
cells of patients whose own genes lack the coding needed to stimulate 
production of disease-fighting hormones or enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
The experiments will be performed on individuals suffering from melanoma, a 
potentially lethal skin cancer, and in children with adenosine deaminase 
deficiency, an inherited and incurable immune system deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The melanoma treatment will be performed on patients who are in an advanced 
stage of the disease, for which there are no effective therapies, and who would 
otherwise be expected to live only about four months. 
</P>
<P>
The melanoma experiment will involve inserting a gene that causes cells to 
produce tumor necrosis factor, a powerful hormone that kills tumors by cutting 
off their blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
The gene will be put into white blood cells called tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, which typically attack cancer. Scientists at the National Cancer 
Institute have learned how to remove the critical white cells from the patient, 
grow billions of them in the laboratory and return them to the patient's body 
with the new genes. 
</P>
<P>
"This, to me, represents the logical progression of everything I've done for 
the last 10 years," said Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, a leading cancer institute 
researcher who is conducting the study. "It will be very significant if this 
works. Hopefully, if it works, it will be applicable to cancers other than 
melanoma." 
</P>
<P>
Melanoma strikes about 28,000 persons annually and kills about 6,300. The 
incidence of the disease is increasing at a rate of about 4% a year, according 
to the American Cancer Society. It is curable by surgery only if detected very 
early. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said that he would begin the experimental treatments "within days of 
when we have FDA approval." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed treatment for the immune deficiency involves replacing a gene that 
stimulates production of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that is crucial to the 
proper functioning of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
As with the cancer treatment, researchers plan to grow the patient's own white 
cells in a laboratory, add the critical gene, then return the cells to the 
patient's body with the hope that the new cells will stimulate production of 
the enzyme, thus restoring the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that the experiments probably will begin in the fall with two to 
four patients. The disease is rare, afflicting only about 30 children worldwide 
at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Several treatments for the immune disorder already exist. These include bone 
marrow transplantation, which is not often successful, and a new drug approved 
by the FDA last March, PEG-ADA, that replaces the enzyme and has been effective 
in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a public 
interest group that examines the social and ethical implications of 
biotechnology, said that he has "serious reservations" about the immune 
disorder gene experiment because other treatments are available for the 
disease. "I can't understand why any parents would want their kids to try 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rifkin, who for many years has warned of the potential for abuse in human 
genetic engineering, said that he does not oppose the melanoma experiment. "If 
this is all these patients have, they should try it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tests will be the first in the United States involving insertion of genes 
in human patients for therapeutic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, genetically engineered cells were injected into human patients 
for the first time, but not as therapy. The genes were used as "markers" to 
track the movement of cancer-fighting white blood cells in the body.

U.S. FEARS CHAOS, URGES U.N. ACTION ON LIBERIA; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL WAR: POLICY IS REVERSED AMID CONCERN THAT THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES WILL 
STARVE OR BE KILLED.

<P>
The Bush Administration reversed policy Tuesday and asked the United Nations to 
intervene to stop Liberia's slide into chaos, and officials warned of the 
prospect of widespread slaughter in the capital and possible starvation among 
thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after government troops reportedly massacred several hundred people 
seeking shelter in a church, U.S. officials said that about 33,000 refugees 
have taken asylum at U.S. installations across Liberia, including two major 
U.S. communications facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to supply food to those seeking refuge at our 
facilities," one State Department official said, noting that food supplies for 
the 500,000 residents of the capital, Monrovia, were severely depleted because 
fighting had cut off deliveries for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Aid is "urgent," said another U.S. official. "These people are going to 
starve." 
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Monrovia remained heavy Tuesday, according to a joint pool report 
filed by Western journalists in Liberia. Rebel forces initially won control of 
several sections of the city, only to be partly forced back by a government 
counterattack, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to fight until the last soldiers of the Liberian army die," 
President Samuel K. Doe said in a telephone interview with the British 
Broadcasting Corp. The vow was the first public statement in more than a month 
from the 38-year-old former sergeant, who has been staging a last defense from 
his heavily fortified seaside mansion. 
</P>
<P>
When fighting in Liberia began in December, the Administration took a hands-off 
stance, reasoning that none of the warring factions merited American support. 
In recent days, however, the United States has been drawn more closely into 
efforts to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. involvement in Liberia involves both practical and symbolic 
considerations. On the practical side are two hard-to-replace American 
communications stations in the small West African nation, one operated by the 
Voice of America, the other used to transmit CIA and State Department 
communications throughout Africa. 
</P>
<P>
On the symbolic side, said Pauline Baker, an African policy expert at the 
Carnegie Endowment in Washington, Liberia has become "a test of the legacy of 
the U.S. presence in Africa." Liberia was founded in 1847 by freed slaves 
resettled from the United States. The dollar is the local currency, the capital 
is named after a U.S. president and the local militia wears uniforms modeled 
after those of New York City police. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the United States poured more than $500 million in aid into 
Liberia. Much of that money disappeared because of corruption, and much of what 
did go into improving the nation's economy has now been destroyed by war. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 Americans remain in Liberia, according to U.S. officials. In 
addition, several thousand Liberian citizens carry U.S. passports. Many are 
"Americo-Liberian" descendants of the freed slaves, who dominated the nation's 
politics until Doe took over in a coup a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
As the fighting continued Tuesday, forces loyal to one of the country's two 
rebel armies won control of Mamba Point, the city neighborhood where the U.S. 
Embassy and several other foreign missions are located, American officials said 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But late in the day, about 500 soldiers loyal to Doe, advancing under the 
protection of their last remaining tank, staged a counterattack, retaking 
control of government buildings that rebels had seized earlier, according to 
the joint pool report. Heavy fighting was reported near the embassies, but no 
U.S. personnel were reported injured, Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Administration is "actively consulting with other members of the 
(U.N.) Security Council with the objective of having a Security Council meeting 
on Liberia, which we hope will involve the United Nations in trying to arrange 
a cease-fire." The Security Council could meet as early as today to consider 
options ranging from a cease-fire call to creation of a U.N. peacekeeping force 
to separate the three rival armies. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Monday, Administration officials had publicly rejected the idea 
of U.N. involvement in Liberia, saying that the move would be 
counterproductive. U.S. analysts had hoped that the warring factions would be 
able to reach a peace settlement or that the arrival of rebel forces in 
Monrovia earlier this month would rapidly bring a close to fighting. 
</P>
<P>
But officials now concede that their analysis was wrong. "Something's got to be 
done at this point," one White House official said, noting that divisions 
between two rebel forces with different ethnic bases have turned the fighting 
into a three-cornered war of increasing ferocity likely to continue even if Doe 
can be dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
"Forces on both sides, government and the rebel side, are continuing to commit 
atrocities," Cohen said. The massacre at the Lutheran church late Sunday was 
only the latest in a series of attacks on civilians as the fighting has become 
an outlet for widespread bloodletting between rival ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rebel armies is headed by Charles Taylor, an Americo-Liberian 
educated in the United States but accused by his opponents of links to Libya. 
The other is led by Prince Johnson, whose support comes mostly from Liberia's 
Gio and Mano tribes. Both men once served in Doe's government. Doe, for his 
part, draws most of his support from fellow members of the Krahn tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the atrocities, Cohen said, Liberians are starving. "It's very 
important that the fighting stop so that the international community can engage 
in a massive humanitarian rescue effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel forces have made "a special effort" to supply food to refugees seeking 
shelter at U.S. facilities, Cohen said. But American officials are increasingly 
concerned that food, water and sanitation facilities are inadequate for the 
refugees, who began pouring into three U.S.-held areas of the country about 10 
days ago.

TRINIDAD REBELS FREE PREMIER; 40 STILL HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Captive Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson, suffering a festering leg wound and 
imperiled eyesight, was released by black Muslim rebels Tuesday, but 40 other 
hostages were still being held as efforts to free them dragged into a fifth day 
without progress. 
</P>
<P>
The ailing prime minister was led to an ambulance in front of Red House, the 
twin-island nation's besieged Parliament building, by one of his captors and 
another hostage, according to Atty. Gen. Anthony Smart, a senior member of the 
Cabinet team that has been negotiating with the rebels via radio, telephone and 
a clergyman intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was taken first to the Trinidadian army's Camp Ogden, then to an 
unidentified hospital, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Robinson "is in good spirits," but he is reported to be suffering from 
an apparently infected gunshot wound in one leg. Robinson also reportedly is 
experiencing eye problems resulting from his lack of glaucoma medication since 
the Parliament building was seized by the rebels in a coup attempt Friday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Smart refused to give details of the talks that led to Robinson's freedom, but 
he indicated that the release did not represent a breakthrough in the overall 
hostage negotiations, which ran aground after near-agreement Monday. A 
government spokesman, Gregory Shaw, said the hostage takers' "demands are 
escalating, and some of the demands are clearly impossible to meet." 
</P>
<P>
"This crisis is far from over," Smart declared. 
</P>
<P>
The first hint of the surprise development Tuesday came in an early morning 
telephone conversation between the leader of the rebels and journalists. 
Speaking from the besieged Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) building, the 
chief hostage taker, Yasin abu Bakr, offered to release Robinson on 
humanitarian grounds, with no strings attached, "because he is sick." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu Bakr virtually bombarded local and foreign reporters with phone 
calls to the government's temporary press headquarters in the Holiday Inn 
Hotel, a few blocks from Red House. The calls revealed a growing tone of 
desperation among his estimated 120 armed comrades and at least some captives. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Abu Bakr charged that a coterie of Cabinet ministers had 
torpedoed a signed agreement to end the crisis, which he contended was reached 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"They have now pulled a new coup, and they are holding everyone ransom," Abu 
Bakr cried in an anxious, angry voice during one call several hours before 
Robinson's release. "They are blocking it because they want Mr. Robinson dead." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was not spelled out by Abu Bakr or government officials, but it 
reportedly included Robinson's pledge to resign; formation of an interim 
government including Abu Bakr, and total amnesty for the rebels, who are 
believed to have received military training and financial support from Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old former police officer, who founded the black Muslim group 
Jamaat al Muslimeen six years ago, called for former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter and the Rev. Jesse Jackson to come to Trinidad so he would have someone 
"straightforward" to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
In another call to journalists, Abu Bakr complained that the police and army 
troops who have surrounded the two hostage sites are trying to starve his group 
into submission. He charged that the army ignored his calls for food and water 
until 3 a.m. Sunday, when they placed provisions in the street in front of the 
television building and dared the hostage takers to come out for them. 
</P>
<P>
The Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force also had tried to split the hostage 
takers by cutting off all lines of communication between the television 
buildings, where 25 of the captives are held, and Red House, where 15 remain at 
gunpoint, Abu Bakr contended. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Forces spokesman, Maj. Dave Williams, acknowledged that all lines 
to the two buildings have been cut and expressed astonishment that the rebel 
leader had secured a phone line to the press hotel. Abu Bakr explained that he 
had "a genius" in his group who engineered the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the hostages, television news director Jones P. Madeira and reporter 
Raul Pantin, seconded Abu Bakr's agitated complaints when he passed the 
telephone to them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I spoke to the army yesterday afternoon, I said, 'Everybody's dying of 
starvation in here,' " Madeira recalled Tuesday. "What are they trying to do, 
get me killed?" 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives are threatened here, but not by the imam," said Pantin, using Abu 
Bakr's title as an Islamic religious leader. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked Abu Bakr if he is fearful of the outcome of the siege, he 
replied only: "Everyone will die at some time in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Charles A. Gargano provided some insight into the 
situation for five American journalists who visited the American Embassy on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his own contacts with the Trinidad and Tobago government concerning 
the crisis, Gargano said, "The last communication we had with the government 
(early Tuesday) is that they are still discussing the situation, and it has 
been going up and down." He expressed hope that a peaceful solution would be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Although declining to provide details of his conversations with local 
officials, Gargano said the Americans already are "looking at programs where we 
might be able to assist with such things as emergency food shipments." 
</P>
<P>
After a weekend of widespread looting, virtually all supermarkets and food 
shops in Port of Spain have been stripped bare, and a severe food shortage has 
developed.

2 STATES OF PROGRESS FOR LATINOS;

FOR MINORITIES IN POLITICS, TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA ARE WORLDS APART. DEMOGRAPHIC

<P>
Slim and cerebral, Texas state Rep. Dan Morales could have passed for another 
dressed-for-success comer on a partnership track in a downtown law firm as he 
addressed a group of young lawyers here recently. 
</P>
<P>
But the 34-year-old Morales is on a different track, one that has him pointed 
toward Texas' top legal job. As a legislator representing a poor and largely 
Latino district of San Antonio, Morales this spring won the Democratic 
nomination for attorney general, an office that launched gubernatorial bids for 
its last two occupants. 
</P>
<P>
No Latino has held such an influential elected position either in Texas or 
California, the two states with the largest Latino communities. In Texas, at 
least, Morales' trail-blazing candidacy is widely viewed as evolutionary, not 
revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Latinos here have steadily progressed from the 
fringe toward the center of political life, entrenching themselves in local 
government offices from school boards to legislative offices. 
</P>
<P>
"At least from my part of the state," said Morales, "we sort of grew up having 
commissioners named Garza and mayors named Cisneros and district judges with 
Hispanic surnames." 
</P>
<P>
That has not yet become the routine in California. Latinos are roughly 
one-fourth of the population in both states, but political advances have come 
much more grudgingly in California than in Texas. Since 1973, the number of 
Latino elected officials in Texas has grown one-third faster than in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
That gap frames the extent of the task that Latino activists in California 
face. If Texas suggests the possibilities for Latino gains in California, it 
also illuminates the obstacles. Many of the political and demographic 
ingredients that produced success in Texas are, like longhorn cows, scarcer on 
the Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Though Latinos, the nation's fastest-growing major population group, have 
acquired substantial political power in less populous states such as New Mexico 
and Colorado, it is in Texas and California that their success largely will be 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
The two states present a mixed score card. With their dramatic advances since 
the early 1970s, Latinos hold 6.7% of all elected offices in Texas, according 
to calculations of the Southwest Voter Research Institute, compared with just 
4.7% in California. 
</P>
<P>
The gap is widest in the most influential positions. Texas Latinos hold one 
more congressional seat than California's, though Texas has 18 fewer 
representatives in the House. In Texas, the percentage of countywide elected 
offices, such as boards of supervisors, controlled by Latinos is almost four 
times greater than in California. (No Latino, for example, has ever won a seat 
on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, though that could change later 
this year with court-ordered redrawing of district lines). 
</P>
<P>
"We have been unable to crack that mid-level, as they have in Texas," said 
Fernando J. Guerra, chairman of Chicano studies at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1970s, the number of Latinos in the Texas Legislature has 
nearly doubled. Latinos now hold 24 seats in the two chambers -- almost 14% of 
the total -- and represent an influential voting block, especially on education 
and social programs. 
</P>
<P>
In California, however, the number of Latino state legislators has been stuck 
at seven since the mid-1970s. Today, just three Latinos serve in its state 
Senate and four are in the Assembly -- a slim 6% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Opportunities 
</P>
<P>
In recent times, opportunities for statewide office also have been greater in 
Texas. Four years ago, a Republican Latino judge ran a strong race against then 
Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox, although he lost. Until former San Antonio Mayor Henry 
G. Cisneros, a moderate with an incandescent presence and a strong appeal to 
business, admitted having an extramarital affair, the only question was whether 
Cisneros would seek the Democrats' nomination for governor or for senator. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, with Cisneros' active support, filled the vacuum with an 
aggressiveness that belies his mild appearance. 
</P>
<P>
After a decisive primary victory against John Odam, a Houston attorney close to 
former Gov. Mark White, Morales now leads Republican state Sen. J. E. (Buster) 
Brown in the early general election polls. Unless November produces a strong 
Republican tide, most analysts here agree that Brown will be swimming upstream. 
</P>
<P>
In California, no Latino has been nominated to run for a statewide 
constitutional office since 1958, according to Guerra's research. Some Latinos 
are mentioned as potential statewide candidates in California, but none are on 
the November ballot or in a commanding position to compete for a major 
statewide post in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
"It will happen," Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre insisted. "It 
will not happen because of the parties; it's going to happen because of the 
community. We've been conditioned to fail. We have to be conditioned to 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tale of 2 States 
</P>
<P>
What explains the differences between the two states? 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that Texas Latinos have had more incentive to organize than 
Californians because racial prejudice historically was more severe in Texas, 
land of the patron and the whites-only primary election. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexicans went to California from Texas because things were better," said 
Rodolfo O. de La Garza, director for the Center for Mexican American Studies at 
the University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that racial prejudice coiled more tightly around Texas than 
California, but most California Latino activists reject the notion that social 
conditions in the latter were idyllic enough to pacify potential activism. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth that California was nowhere near as harsh as Texas is just that -- a 
myth," said Richard P. Fajardo, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors seem more telling. Most experts point to the implacable rhythms 
of demography and the calculated jostle of partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
With California functioning as the nation's premier port of entry, almost half 
the growth of its Latino community in recent years has come from legal and 
illegal immigrants, according to a recent Census Bureau study. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, whose flickering economic performance has not provided nearly as 
powerful a beacon for immigrants, births account for twice as much of the 
recent Latino growth as immigration. Thus, a far greater proportion of Latinos 
in Texas are eligible to vote. In Texas, more than 80% of all adult Latinos are 
U.S. citizens, compared to just over 60% in California. Latinos now constitute 
about 11% of the electorate in a typical Texas election, compared to about 7% 
or 8% in California. 
</P>
<P>
It is extremely difficult for political organizers in California to sift 
through the Latino population and identify those eligible to register and vote. 
The Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, the principal organization 
registering Latinos, has led effective registration drives in Texas since the 
mid-1970s. After several years of effort, it still has not significantly 
affected California politics. 
</P>
<P>
The different demographic patterns of the two communities shape their political 
involvement in more subtle ways, too. Many experts believe that Texas Latinos, 
relatively more of whom were born in the communities where they live, have a 
greater sense of connection with local politics and society than the mobile, 
fluid and more ethnically diverse Latino community of Southern California.

"In Texas, the Hispanic community is more like (blacks in) the South, in that 
people have been here a little while," said Austin-based Ernesto Cortes, 
Southwest regional supervisor for the Industrial Areas Foundation, which 
organizes neighborhood advocacy groups. "Here you have all kinds of networks -- 
families that have been in their churches for three generations." 
</P>
<P>
High Expectations 
</P>
<P>
With such stability come rising political and social expectations, a force 
whose full effect is not felt for generations but is as powerful as any in 
American life. 
</P>
<P>
Morales' own story illustrates the point. No one in his family had been 
politically active before he first ran for and won a seat in the Texas House in 
1984. But his achievements stand on a platform of steady upward mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Though two of his grandparents were born in Mexico, both of his parents were 
born in Texas. His mother, Felicia, growing up as the daughter of a Methodist 
minister, lived mostly in poor South Texas communities where English was the 
acquired language; his father, Henry, the son of a laborer, attended segregated 
elementary schools in small Texas towns. 
</P>
<P>
Both parents attended college, his father on the GI bill, and in the mid-1950s 
they settled in San Antonio, where Henry Morales began a career as a teacher 
and school administrator. As he ascended into each new job through the 1960s, 
Henry Morales was often the first Latino to reach his level, and he never 
escaped the prickly awareness of being an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to put out 150% or 200%," he recalled recently. "That was how you 
were accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Morales, the oldest of their three sons, grew up free from that feeling of 
precariousness. Living in an integrated neighborhood and speaking English at 
home, he never contained his expectations because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan is different from me because he grew up completely free," his father said 
softly. "He never felt discrimination. He always felt a belongingness that I 
had to earn." 
</P>
<P>
That liberating sense of belonging, hard won through the generations, helped to 
propel Dan Morales through Trinity University in San Antonio, law school at 
Harvard and a short stint as a prosecutor in the Bexar County (San Antonio) 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
It was equally evident in his rapid rise in the state Legislature, where he cut 
an independent course, quickly won the chairmanship of the powerful Criminal 
Jurisprudence Committee and assumed more moderate positions on many issues than 
most of his Latino colleagues, earning criticism from some of them in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Morales knows how to punch the buttons of ethnic pride, yet it is his lack of 
either ethnic or ideological consciousness that is most striking about him -- 
and revealing of the assumptions instilled in him by the gains of his parents. 
Morales has the confidence in his appeal to whites to focus more of his message 
on a convergence of minority and majority interests than on the conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Interests 
</P>
<P>
"Public education is the primary issue for Hispanics; likewise for our state," 
he said briskly. "Criminal justice probably comes in a close second for 
Hispanics; likewise for our state. I don't see any inconsistency in the way a 
legislator would be called upon to represent a Hispanic community versus the 
way a legislator would represent a black or Anglo community." 
</P>
<P>
That may be so, but few Latinos have had the chance to prove it. Most Latino 
legislators in Texas still have Latino-majority constituencies. That's also 
true in California, but assembling those majorities into districts is 
substantially easier in Texas -- another reason Latino political gains there 
have outpaced those of their counterparts in California. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino population of Texas is significantly more concentrated into discrete 
areas -- primarily South Texas -- than the Latino population in California, 
which has scattered from East Los Angeles and other enclaves into new suburbs 
like filings rearranged by a hidden magnet. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, the concentration of Latino settlement has facilitated efforts 
in Texas to eliminate local, at-large elections that tend to leave minority 
candidates at a disadvantage. Using the Voting Rights Act, Latino activists in 
Texas have won decisions compelling dozens of jurisdictions to switch from 
elections in which officeholders are selected at large, where the majority 
population can control who wins all seats, to geographically defined districts 
that more accurately reflect minority concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
In communities where Texas Latinos have won such suits, their representation 
has dramatically increased, often by three times or more. 
</P>
<P>
In California, fewer than 10 such suits have been filed and those have had 
mixed success, according to Fajardo of MALDEF. Without judicial orders for 
change, the vast majority of local contests in California still are at-large 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Even where California Latinos have won such litigation, as in Watsonville last 
year, they have had difficulty translating their legal gains into electoral 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Latino population patterns also shape the decennial redistricting of 
legislative seats. Most analysts agree that the diffusion of Latinos in 
California, and the relatively small number of eligible voters on a typical 
block, has made it more difficult to draw congressional and state legislative 
districts that Latinos can win. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is greatly complicated by the sheer size of legislative seats in 
California. Each California state senator represents about 750,000 people, more 
than 14 U.S. senators. In those massive districts even substantial minority 
populations are overwhelmed, like flecks of color in a bucket of whitewash. 
Only three of the 40 state Senate districts are as much as 40% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
California Latinos worked loyally with the Democratic majority in the last 
redistricting, but got little to show for it because of the legislative 
leadership's overwhelming priority on protecting incumbents, said Alan Heslop, 
a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
During the last California redistricting, Latinos picked up two congressional 
seats because the state's overall delegation was increased; but in the zero-sum 
maneuvering of legislative redistricting, Latinos did not gain any additional 
seat even though Richard Alatorre then chaired the key Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
In the last Texas redistricting, Latinos filed suit against the plans crafted 
by the Democratic majority and eventually gained four seats in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
For 1991, Latino activists have launched an unprecedented effort to influence 
redistricting in six states across the Southwest. Having concentrated its legal 
resources on Texas last time, "our primary goal in 1990 is California," said 
Jose Garza, MALDEF's national voting project director. 
</P>
<P>
Still no one is very optimistic about Latino prospects in the California 
redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
If the state gains enough new congressional seats, one additional spot for a 
Latino may be carved out. But unless a flock of incumbents suddenly migrates to 
other careers, redistricting experts say it will be difficult for Latinos to 
pick up even one or two seats in either chamber. 
</P>
<P>
With the pressure of incumbency limiting the options, the likelihood is that in 
California the already enormous gap between the Latino share of the population 
and their representation in the Legislature will widen further. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very bad situation here," said political scientist Heslop. 
"Demographic change has been accelerating for the past decade and the 
representative institutions have wholly failed to keep pace with that change." 
</P>
<P>
Though that gap remains substantial in Texas, too, the outlook may be brighter. 
With rapid population growth in parts of South Texas, new Latino seats are 
likely in the next redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if Morales can maintain his early lead, he can raise the sights of 
an entire generation of ambitious Latino politicians. One is Christine 
Hernandez, a San Antonio school board member who, this spring, won the 
nomination to succeed Morales in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you have someone open that door," Hernandez said, "it will inspire other 
people to follow."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer who contends she was struck by a San Diego County sheriff's deputy 
while inside the downtown County Jail is entitled to have a lawsuit on the 
claim heard in Superior Court, not Municipal Court, a state appellate court 
ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a damage recovery is far greater in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, claims in Municipal Court are limited to $25,000, while it 
takes at least a $25,000 claim to pursue a case in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Lucy Gilcrest Mesecher listed out-of-pocket expenses of $18,400 from the 
Dec. 9, 1987, incident, the 4th District Court of Appeal said. Mesecher claims 
that, as she left a client at a video arraignment room at the jail, a deputy 
who apparently did not know she was a lawyer on official business pushed her 
and hurt her arm. 
</P>
<P>
Mesecher also offered to settle the case for $12,000, well below the $25,000 
floor, Judge Gilbert Nares said for the court. 
</P>
<P>
But Nares added that Mesecher also claimed substantial, though unspecified, 
damages for emotional distress, and that was enough for her to be heard in 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Mesecher, who had been a lawyer with Community Defenders and the Legal Aid 
Society of San Diego, since has moved her law practice to Santa Barbara, Nares 
said. She could not be reached Tuesday for comment.

RENTERS TO EARN INTEREST; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE CITY COUNCIL WILL HAVE LANDLORDS OF RENT-CONTROLLED UNITS PAY 5% 
ON TENANTS' SECURITY DEPOSITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved a measure Tuesday under which renters 
will be paid 5% interest on the security deposits they are required to give 
landlords -- interest that could amount to more than $60 million between now 
and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the council tightened the city's Rent Stabilization Ordinance 
to prevent landlords from summarily evicting tenants or imposing large rent 
increases when a baby, a relative or an additional person moves into an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The council's 10-3 vote on interest payments was considered a victory for 
tenants, who for years have grumbled about the interest they lose on the 
sizable security deposits they pay landlords. 
</P>
<P>
That measure, expected to take effect in a few weeks, covers only the 470,000 
rent-controlled apartment units in the city -- not apartments built after 1978, 
single-family homes or luxury units. 
</P>
<P>
Only those renters who stay in their apartments for at least a year would 
qualify for interest payments from their landlord. Lump payments will be made 
every five years -- or sooner for tenants who move out. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky voiced a concern echoed by several council members 
that, because of holes in the city's Rent Stabilization Ordinance, landlords 
have been allowed to hang onto the interest earned on money that is not theirs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you take somebody's money and hold it, you pay interest on that," 
Yaroslavsky said. "You have to pay the interest because that is the American 
way. . . . It's simply what's right." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilman Michael Woo: "The opposition I hear from some apartment-owner 
groups highlights the fact for me that over the course of our rent control 
laws, some owners have come to think of this money as their own." 
</P>
<P>
Under existing law, the security deposit paid to a landlord must be returned in 
full two weeks after a tenant moves out -- unless the apartment needs repairs 
beyond painting, cleaning and normal wear and tear. That provision remains 
unchanged under the new measure. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Fowler, a lobbyist for so-called mom-and-pop apartment owners, argued that 
the interest payments to tenants are a disguised effort to lower rents in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rents are low enough," Fowler said. "Don't pass these laws." 
</P>
<P>
Under a rent stabilization law adopted in 1985, landlords may raise the rent 
each year based upon the regional inflation rate. The allowable rent increase 
in recent years has ranged from 4% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Isham of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles opposed the 
measure, pointing out that interest on typical security deposits -- which 
usually range from $500 to $1,000 in Los Angeles -- would amount to only $25 or 
$50 annually. Isham argued that the interest was not worth the paperwork that 
would be created to return the money. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents -- including several council members -- pointed out that a poor 
person or senior citizen who accumulated such interest over five years could be 
greatly helped by a reimbursement from the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of five years, for a senior citizen (who paid a $500 security 
deposit), it's $125 in interest," Councilman Joel Wachs said. "That's a lot of 
money for a senior citizen, $125." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs estimated that, if a conservative security deposit of $500 is assumed for 
each of the 470,000 affected apartment units, tenants will accrue $58 million 
in interest from landlords by 1995. However, city officials said the interest 
payments are likely to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted 12 to 1 to prohibit eviction or rent increases when a 
household adds one dependent child. The law will cover multiple births such as 
triplets. 
</P>
<P>
With an eye to the city's overcrowded conditions, the council also voted to 
protect tenants from eviction if they add one extra person, whether or not that 
person is a relative. Under the measure, the landlord will be allowed to raise 
the rent by 10%, but not evict the tenants, as is currently permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Zeidman, director of the city's Rent Stabilization Division, said the 
landlord must accept any reasonable additional tenant. However, if a proposed 
tenant has a history of bad credit, past evictions or other problems directly 
related to renting, a landlord will still be able to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
"This recognizes that even with rent control, people are not able to pay rent 
and are having to bring in a roommate," said Larry Gross, director of the 
Coalition for Economic Survival.

EX-JUDGE WILL BE INTERIM HEAD OF TROUBLED CHILDREN'S AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Elwood G. Lui, a retired appellate judge who once presided over the county's 
Dependency Court system, has been tapped by the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors to temporarily head the county Department for Children's Services 
in the wake of the resignation of Robert L. Chaffee as director of the troubled 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Lui, whose appointment was announced by Supervisor Ed Edelman Tuesday afternoon 
after the board met in closed session, will serve for three to four months 
while a private recruiting firm conducts a nationwide search for a replacement 
for Chaffee. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee, who spent his last day on the job Tuesday, could not be reached for 
comment. He announced his resignation July 19 amid mounting criticism of his 
agency from children's advocates and state officials, who have threatened to 
take over the county's $457-million child welfare services system. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chaffee said he would remain in his $106,200-a-year position through 
Oct. 31, Edelman had been pressing for the immediate appointment of an interim 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here today to tell you that we have someone who will give us the help that 
we need to get this department back on track," Edelman said Tuesday in 
announcing Lui's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Lui said he intends to focus on satisfying the concerns of state officials, 
helping to settle a long-running class-action lawsuit over visitation between 
children and their social workers, and improving the department's tarnished 
image. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope," he said, "that we will be able to restore the confidence that 
the community needs to have in this department." 
</P>
<P>
Now a lawyer in private practice, Lui, 49, retired from the 2nd District Court 
of Appeal in 1987. Those who know him say he had an especially rapid rise in 
the judiciary, moving from the Municipal Court to the Superior Court, where he 
served as a juvenile judge and, for six months, presiding judge of the 
Dependency Court. He was named to the appellate bench in 1981. In addition, he 
served as president of the California Judges Assn. from 1986 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Said Judge Paul Boland, who succeeded Lui as presiding judge of the Dependency 
Court: "He asked probing questions, he listened attentively and then acted 
decisively." 
</P>
<P>
Lui will be paid $12,000 a month in his new position, and will technically 
serve as a management consultant while County Administrative Officer Richard B. 
Dixon takes the title of interim director. However, Lui said he expects to be 
fully in charge of the department. He said the split leadership arrangement is 
necessary to permit him to continue to fulfill some of his obligations to his 
law clients. They include the County of Los Angeles, which he represents in a 
dispute over Malibu cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Lui said he intends to begin work at Children's Services by Aug. 8. He will 
find a department that suffers from low morale and has been rocked by news 
accounts of mismanagement, lawsuits and pressure from state officials. 
</P>
<P>
The county is under orders to present the state with a detailed plan for 
complying with state regulations by Oct. 1. In addition, he will have to work 
with a court-appointed referee who has been named to help improve the county's 
record of providing children with face-to-face visits from their social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Lui's appointment was praised by children's advocates, including members of the 
the county Commission for Children's Services, an advisory panel that oversees 
the department and has often been at odds with Chaffee. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard good things about him," said commission President Helen Kleinberg.

FIRE: A 30-ACRE BLAZE OVERRUNS DANTE'S VIEW GARDEN IN GRIFFITH PARK. BUT THE 
85-YEAR-OLD CARETAKER IS OPTIMISTIC THAT IT WILL SPRING BACK TO LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Charlie Turner climbed to the summit of Mt. Hollywood on Tuesday to tend his 
garden, the famed Dante's View, making the same pilgrimage he had completed 
almost daily for the last decade and a half. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, something was different. 
</P>
<P>
As the 85-year-old Turner checked the sprinklers and prepared to rake the 
earth, he smelled smoke. Then he saw the flames. 
</P>
<P>
A wildfire was racing up the eastern flank of Griffith Park's Mt. Hollywood, 
straight toward Dante's View. Turner fled for his life, escaping down the 
western slope of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
But the garden, a half-acre grove of eucalyptus, jade, magnolia and pepper 
trees surrounded by lilies and geraniums -- a favorite oasis to hikers and 
other nature lovers -- was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"You look out and just see a burnt expanse," said Turner, standing atop Mt. 
Hollywood, after more than 100 Los Angeles firefighters, aided by 
water-dropping helicopters, controlled the 30-acre blaze in about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Turner surveyed the blackened ground and charred tree limbs below him. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks tragic. . . . It makes you feel sad," he said as a park ranger gave 
him a hug and words of sympathy. "You look around (and) see desolation. It must 
be like coming back after a battle." 
</P>
<P>
Turner has dedicated most of the last 15 years to caring for the garden, a 
hillside retreat overlooking the Griffith Park Observatory and offering a 
million-dollar view of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian-born Italian muralist Dante Orgolini carved the garden out of native 
chaparral in 1965 by hauling trees and cacti up the side of Mt. Hollywood. 
Turner began working for Orgolini in the 1970s, and inherited his role as 
unofficial caretaker upon the artist's death in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning Turner would hike to the garden from his Hollywood home and spend 
several hours tending to the plants, trimming the trees, irrigating the soil, 
erasing graffiti. During the recent heat wave, he hauled three to five gallons 
of water a mile uphill every day when the water supply was temporarily cut off 
for work on leaky pipes. 
</P>
<P>
And on weekends, Turner usually presides over potluck brunches attended by a 
number of friends and fellow trailblazers who hike to Dante's View. The city 
even named the trail head after Turner. 
</P>
<P>
So for the British-born octogenarian, the destruction at Dante's View was 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
"All the eucalyptus trees burned. They must have been the first to go," Turner 
said, making a mental inventory. "I had a bunch of white lilies. They're all 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials told reporters that the blaze appeared to have started near the 
park's bird sanctuary and was the third fire in the same square-mile area in 
the last two weeks. The cause of Tuesday's fire is under investigation. There 
were no injuries, and no structures were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Dante's View took the brunt of the fire. But despite the loss, 
Turner remains hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
From ashes springs life, he says. His work as a caretaker now becomes the work 
of a rebuilder. Most of the trees' roots probably escaped severe harm, he 
believes, and it is likely the plants will grow again. He'll dig up the lily 
bulbs and clear out the burned brush, salvaging what he can. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have quite a bit of work to do, but we'll get it done," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Replanting will probably begin in October, after the heat of summer has died 
down, said Tom La Bonge, field deputy for City Councilman John Ferraro, whose 
district includes the park. He said he expects that the city's Department of 
Recreation and Parks will chip in with some shrubbery, and volunteers -- 
"Everybody loves Charlie," he noted -- will pour out to help. 
</P>
<P>
Turner planned to begin work on his beloved garden immediately, maybe even 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks bad, but it will come back," Turner said. "By next spring, it will be 
back. Good as ever."

A family of four taking their first motor home trip from British Columbia to 
Disneyland were identified Tuesday as the victims of a fiery crash in Burbank 
that left a man, his wife and stepdaughter dead and his stepson badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Bertsch, a milkman who lived in Killiney Beach, had recently inherited the 
35-foot camper. 
</P>
<P>
Bertsch, 45, his wife, Joanne, who was in her late 30s, and her children from 
an earlier marriage, Gavin Sweezie, 14, and Allison Sweezie, 10, set off 
Thursday for Southern California, said neighbor Kim Redding. 
</P>
<P>
"They were so looking forward to this trip," Redding said tearfully. "The 
family had traveled often. But this was the first time in the motor home and 
the kids were so excited because they were going to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
The trip ended in catastrophe Monday morning on the southbound Golden State 
Freeway when the motor home and a semi-truck hauling 50,000 pounds of tomatoes 
collided and crashed into a concrete abutment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL OKS BOND ISSUE FOR NEW 911 
SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $235-million bond issue to pay for a new 911 emergency call system was 
approved unanimously by the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday for placement 
on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department is backing the measure as a way to finance replacement of 
an emergency response system that officials say is outmoded and overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure is approved by the voters, the emergency dispatch system located 
in City Hall East will be replaced by two centers -- one in the San Fernando 
Valley and the other at an undetermined location in the central city. Police 
officials have said that two centers are necessary in case an earthquake or 
other disaster knocks out one emergency center.

The road not taken is not forsaken. 
</P>
<P>
Route 66 -- America's Main Street, desperation highway during the Dust Bowl, 
big fun on the blacktop for postwar vacationers, the nation's first all-paved 
trans-Western roadway from Chicago to Santa Monica -- is fading from the road 
maps, but not from the government's memory, and we taxpayers all know how long 
that lasts. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has ordered that the road be studied for possible historic designation 
and commemoration as the asphalt that took us from the Jazz Age in 1928 to the 
Space Age in 1984, when it was finally bypassed by superhighways. 
</P>
<P>
Once a majestic 2,448 miles long, stretches of it now serve as humble frontage 
roads for interstates, while other parts lie untouched -- not unlike the 1960s 
TV series, "Route 66," which makes more appearances in trivia games than on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned. At the signpost up ahead, your next stop: the history books. 
</P>
<P>
A little song, a little dance, a little malathion down your fly. 
</P>
<P>
For five bucks, you can get in on an evening of ecologically conscious 
roistering at the Iguana Cafe in North Hollywood this Friday, the proceeds 
going to stop malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Folk singer Fred Starner, who says he has sung with the old master minstrel 
himself, Pete Seeger, has a couple of protest tunes of his own composition to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the program, poets will prosodize, and one performer, mindful 
of the fact that Medflies are put to flight by harmonica music -- as who among 
us is not? -- will play a medley of same. Yes, afraid so -- a harmonica 
convergence. 
</P>
<P>
Couture corner: While everyone was intent on what Zsa Zsa Gabor wore for her 
post-pokey appearance in El Segundo the other day, let it not escape notice 
that her Germanic husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, was resplendently done 
up in blue jeans and Western boots. A regular Rhine-stone cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Sklarewitz of West Hollywood dials a lot of international calls, but he 
didn't recognize the overseas prefix on the phone message left for him. He 
didn't find it in the directory, either. So he called the AT&amp;T operator and 
asked, where is this place? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, that's Marisat, the operator told him. It's an island in the Pacific. And 
it's a very expensive place to call too. 
</P>
<P>
Now Sklarewitz is a man who keeps abreast of the news -- countries declaring 
their independence and all that -- but he'd never heard of the Sovereign Nation 
of Marisat. Unlikely the U.N. has either, for it turns out that Marisat is an 
abbreviation for "marine satellite," one used to transmit shipboard messages, 
and it has its own calling prefix. 
</P>
<P>
Which prompts Sklarewitz to ruminate: "I wonder if they have a flag and a 
national anthem too?" And what about Club Med? 
</P>
<P>
Put on those thinking caps, the ones without mouse ears. Disney has put its 
foot down, and simply won't incorporate in its new Long Beach theme park that 
horrid Spruce Goose thing next to the Queen Mary. So mail your ideas to This 
Space: What to do with the Goose, the big wooden flying boat? Give it back to 
the spotted owls? Run an ad to see if Howard Hughes will turn up to reclaim it? 
</P>
<P>
Special FX: a fax to This Space got so muzzied up coming through the ether that 
"Raul Rodriguez," the champion Rose Parade float designer, came out looking 
like "Paul Rodriguez," and as everyone knows, Paul Rodriguez is the comedian. 
No flowers, please.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CENTURY CABLE OFFERS REWARD IN VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Century Cable Television offered a $25,000 reward Tuesday for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who cut a cable line in West 
Los Angeles, leaving 150,000 homes temporarily without service. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rosendahl, the firm's vice president, said a fiber cable line was cut at 
11:05 p.m. Monday by someone who climbed a power pole on Santa Monica 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 homes throughout Los Angeles, Santa Monica, West Hollywood and 
Beverly Hills were without service from 30 seconds to an hour before backup 
systems went on line. 
</P>
<P>
Rosendahl said he believes the incident may be related to contract negotiations 
involving about 190 of the company's installers and technicians. Mmembers of 
the Communication Workers of America have voted to strike Friday. CWA officials 
have offered to assist Century in its investigation.

There are limits, presumably, to what people will do to get on television. 
There must be a line drawn, somewhere, between lust for fame and common human 
dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Bowles saw that line and toed it. Then he hurtled across. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on a stage at Universal Studios on Tuesday, before judges and a small 
audience, the 34-year-old Santa Monica man dropped to all fours and pretended 
to be a buffalo, snorting and butting a chair with his head. All this in hopes 
of getting on a television commercial for peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no shame," said Bowles, looking otherwise ordinary in slacks and a 
Windbreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 50 people took turns at such tomfoolery during the day at an open 
audition for Planters Peanuts. The snack company is mounting an advertising 
campaign entitled "Everybody Loves a Nut" and invited "fun-filled adults" to 
perform 30 seconds of zaniness. 
</P>
<P>
The top three acts would be considered for a spot on a nationally televised ad. 
</P>
<P>
Comics and ventriloquists showed up. A dwarf came dressed as a peanut. A deaf 
man addressed a can of mixed nuts in sign language. There were tap dancers and 
rap singers, a Sinatra sing-alike and an Elvis impersonator, who billed himself 
Elvis Peanut. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an older, overweight Elvis," said Jeff Zandberg, of Los Angeles, who wore 
long sideburns and a cardboard peanut costume. "I think I got my message 
across." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Adams of Playa del Rey brought a sheltie named Tequila. The dog wrestled 
with a radio-controlled toy car. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Ray of Los Angeles wrestled with himself, flipping and flopping across the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
These and the other acts were judged on humor, originality, lovability and 
adaptability to television. Contestants were warned away from profanity, 
excessive props and dangerous stunts. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what to expect," said Roger Adams, who identified himself as 
the Director of Nuts for Planters Lifesavers Co. "We're pleased with what we 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
Planters will hold similar auditions this month in New York and Chicago. The 
company is also accepting videotapes from those who prefer to act foolish in 
private. At least one winner, and perhaps more, will be chosen by October. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make this a grass-roots effort," Adams said. "People who have 
special acts, or play the harmonica through their nose . . . things like that." 
</P>
<P>
A number of Tuesday's contestants described themselves as aspiring actors and 
saw the audition as a chance at their big break. 
</P>
<P>
Others came on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just sitting around, drinking beers," said Jeff Miller, a 26-year-old 
Los Angeles attorney. 
</P>
<P>
He and friends Pete Cunningham and Bill Molinski stripped to the waist to 
reveal Mr. Peanut figures painted on their stomachs. They hummed a tune and 
wiggled about. 
</P>
<P>
Said Molinski, of the act's beery inspiration: "We said to ourselves, 'Let's be 
creative for a minute.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Martinez, 26, of Pasadena, was persuaded to audition by a friend. 
Coming on stage near the end, she stood at the microphone and recounted a dream 
of giving birth to peanuts. This tale left the judges and audience silent, 
apparently stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"I really did dream that. About three weeks ago," Martinez said later. "They 
said, 'Hi mama.' "

SPECIAL LEVY FOR CLEANING UP STORM DRAINS APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to begin taxing 
homeowners and other property owners for improvements to city storm drains, 
which some officials say may rival the price tag for the $3.4-billion 
reconstruction of the city's sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called abatement charge, approved 12-0, would cost the average homeowner 
$2 this year, but the average fee is projected to reach $28 in coming years. 
The charge, expected to be signed into law Friday by Mayor Tom Bradley, will 
appear on county property tax bills in September. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step of the proverbial thousand-mile journey," said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who heads the council's Budget and Finance 
Committee. "Unfortunately, the steps here will be measured in dollars -- a lot 
of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The city is required under a discharge permit issued in June by the Los Angeles 
Regional Water Quality Control Board to reduce water pollution flowing from the 
city's 1,100 miles of storm drains. Litter, oil, grease, toxic heavy-metal 
residues and other pollutants are currently flushed untreated through the 
network into Santa Monica Bay and the Los Angeles River, which empties into the 
harbor at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With the massive sewer reconstruction project at the Hyperion treatment plant 
near El Segundo scheduled to be completed in 1998, environmentalists believe 
storm drain runoff now poses the most serious threat to Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In July, for example, the city of Santa Monica prohibited swimming on a popular 
stretch of beach near the Pico-Kenter storm drain after a water study found 
viruses from human fecal contamination. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense for us to start finally putting some money into making sure the 
water is as safe as possible and the beaches as clean as possible," said Mark 
Gold, staff scientist for Heal the Bay, an environmental watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
During its first year, the new storm drain tax is expected to raise about $4.2 
million, although the city Bureau of Engineering estimates annual assessments 
will increase in coming years to meet projected budgets of $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky and others said costs could skyrocket if the city is forced to 
build treatment facilities for the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be an initial charge system that will change as we get more 
information," said Phil Richardson of the city's Stormwater Management 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the charges are based on a formula that calculates the 
amount of runoff generated by different types of properties. Owners of 
single-family homes, for example, will pay less than owners of parking lots 
because some runoff from homes is absorbed by gardens and lawns. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, Richardson said, the city will adjust charges to reflect types 
and quantity of pollutants generated by properties. It is estimated that 
commercial and industrial properties will pay three-quarters of the program's 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, the biggest chunk of the $4.2 million will be spent to hire 
staff to devise a storm-water cleanup program, including extensive public 
education. Some officials believe a successful educational program could save 
millions of dollars by reducing pollution at the source. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize that our storm drain system is separate from the sewer 
system; that what you put in the gutter ends up in the bay, not at Hyperion," 
said Public Works Commissioner Felicia Marcus. "As soon as people understand 
that, they respond well. . . . No one wants to pollute the bay." 
</P>
<P>
The city will also begin work this year on pilot programs at the Thornton 
Avenue storm drain in Venice and a treatment plant at Ballona Creek near Marina 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will monitor runoff at Thornton Avenue to test proposals to improve 
the quality of storm drain runoff. Street-cleaning crews, for example, will use 
vacuum cleaners instead of traditional sweepers to determine if the change 
reduces pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The city wants to develop an inflatable rubber dam at the mouth of Ballona 
Creek to serve as a plug for storm runoff. Water collected by the dam would be 
pumped to a treatment facility. 
</P>

KIDS TAKE THE FIELD FOR WORLD BASEBALL FAIR

"It's a beautiful day for baseball," everyone was expecting Ernie Banks to say. 
"Let's play two!" 
</P>
<P>
But Banks, the Chicago Cubs' Hall of Famer and irrepressible optimist, forgot 
to deliver his trademark line. "I made an error out there today," he admitted 
later, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
As George Steinbrenner, Pete Rose and even Roseanne Barr could tell you, bigger 
errors have been made. Maybe baseball fans are fretting about the national 
pastime, but on Tuesday, a beautiful day for baseball, Banks and three other 
home run heroes -- Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Japan's Sadaharu Oh -- gathered 
at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium to celebrate the glory of their game -- and 
the hopefully glorious days to come for the likes of 12-year-old Pius Mayunga 
of Zimbabwe, 13-year-old Tom Rudl of Austria, and 13-year-old Olga Sukhoreva of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the opening ceremonies of the World Children's Baseball Fair, 
a weeklong event that has brought together more than 200 children representing 
23 countries to the UCLA campus to promote fundamentals that range from bunting 
to sportsmanship. Confidently described as the "first annual," the baseball 
fair is the brainchild of Oh and some Japanese corporate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Children's Baseball Fair is about children," Oh said through an 
interpreter. "I started playing baseball in Japan when I was in second grade. 
My family was poor, but baseball gave me the opportunity to change my life as 
it did for Henry, Ernie and Willie." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is about opportunity, Oh said. He paid tribute to the late Jackie 
Robinson, the first black allowed to play in major league baseball. Robinson's 
widow, Racheal, participated in the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"His courage was an inspiration to Americans of all colors and creeds," Oh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This was baseball, after all, so the ceremony commenced with the playing of the 
"Star Spangled Banner." The children, all dressed in their uniforms, obediently 
doffed their caps and then sat down and fidgeted as the adults talked on and on 
in languages that only some of them could understand. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, serving as master of ceremonies, introduced each of the aging superstars 
as "this next young man. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron spoke of his respect for Oh, a friendship born of their status as 
respective home run kings of their nations. Aaron hit 755 in the U.S. major 
leagues; Oh hit 868 in Japan's majors. "Mr. Oh's vision of baseball as a means 
of international good will is one that I share," Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays talked of the emotion he felt seeing children of so many nations together. 
"I tell you, I get chills. . . . This isn't about baseball, this is about what 
you're made of." He compared Oh's "dream" to that of Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Racheal Robinson remembered how "our world was opened up" when she and Jackie 
were students at UCLA. She suggested that the world would now open up for the 
children at the baseball fair. 
</P>
<P>
"This world is hungry, really hungry, for peaceful solutions to conflict," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The strong international showing was a measure of both the increasing 
internationalism of baseball and the funding from sponsors such as Hitachi, 
Mizuno and American Airlines. The U.S. home-grown sport, big in Latin America 
and some Asian countries for decades, is now making inroads in Europe and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The time came for Oh, Aaron, Mays and Banks to each throw out a ceremonial 
first pitch. Banks had arranged for Jackie Robinson's grandson, Jesse, to catch 
the first throw -- but a kid from Venezuela cut him off and made the play. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone laughed. Banks wound up again and Jesse caught the ceremonial second 
pitch -- proving it was a good day for two after all. 
</P>
<P>
Soon it was warm-up time for the players, and they seemed glad that the pomp 
and circumstance was over, and they could get down to the business of playing 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Pius Mayunga, a hard-throwing pitcher, was one of five youngsters from Zimbabwe 
who made the trip. Their chaperon explained that a barnstorming Nigerian team 
brought baseball into the country two years ago, and the game is quickly 
gaining in popularity. The five young Zimbabweans said they had never heard of 
Aaron, Oh, Mays or Banks before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Austria, however, the game hasn't exactly caught fire, but Rudl, a rangy 
first baseman, is eager to learn while running track on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Sukhoreva, a girl shortstop, is more experienced at softball. But her 
fellow Soviet, 14-year-old Nodari Sidamonidze, is gung-ho for the game after 
hitting three homers in his first season of play. 
</P>
<P>
Does he like the game? "Da," Sidamonidze said.

PICKETING OF HOMES PROHIBITED; 
</P>
<P>
PROTESTS: THE BAN BY SUPERVISORS APPLIES ONLY TO UNINCORPORATED AREAS. BOARD 
MEMBERS FEAR PICKETS AT THEIR RESIDENCES AND HOPE CITIES WILL FOLLOW THEIR 
LEAD.

<P>
Facing the possibility of protests in front of their homes by Los Angeles 
County employees who do not want to lose their free parking privileges, the 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday passed a law that prohibits picketing of 
"private residences." 
</P>
<P>
The urgency ordinance, which took effect immediately, applies only to 
unincorporated areas of the county -- where none of the five supervisors or 
Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon live. But county officials said they 
hope that local cities will follow their lead and outlaw the picketing of 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the measure 4-0 without discussion. Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum was absent. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they proposed the ordinance after members of Local 660 of 
the Service Employees International Union threatened to march in front of the 
supervisors' homes to protest a proposal that county employees who work in the 
Civic Center pay for parking. 
</P>
<P>
The parking fees are part of a traffic-reduction plan the county submitted this 
year to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials have argued for several weeks against the proposal -- which 
they said could cost clerical workers as much as $1,400 a year -- but they 
denied threatening to picket homes of county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we want to do that, we believe that it is our right to do so. This 
ordinance certainly won't stop us," said Local 660 general manager Sharon 
Grimpe Correll. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Local 660 picketed Dixon's Burbank home in January in a dispute 
over fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Union lawyers will consider challenging the new ordinance as a violation of 
constitutional rights to free speech and public assembly, Correll said. 
</P>
<P>
But the county counsel's office said a U.S. Supreme Court decision allows 
prohibitions against the picketing of homes. In 1988, the high court upheld a 
Wisconsin town's ordinance that made it "unlawful for any person to engage in 
picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual." 
</P>
<P>
In a case stemming from protests outside an abortion doctor's home, Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that "there is simply no right to force speech into 
the home of an unwilling listener." 
</P>
<P>
A picketing ordinance previously was discussed by the supervisors because of 
protests but never voted on, said Frederick R. Bennett, assistant county 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, about 200 people marched in front of Supervisor Mike Antonovich's home 
in Glendale to demand hospice care for dying AIDS patients. A year earlier, 150 
animal-rights activists marched in front of Supervisor Ed Edelman's Westwood 
home in an attempt to prevent the county Department of Animal Care and Control 
from selling some shelter animals to researchers.

COURT RULINGS ON OLLIE NORTH CONVICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by Fein was a waste of valuable column space. 
</P>
<P>
North told the congressional committee and the TV audience all the facts: that 
he violated laws that he did not approve of; that he violated other laws that 
he accepted, but had to violate in order to save his own neck; that he 
endangered his loyal secretary by having her assist him in violating the law; 
that, when the chips were down he copped out putting the finger on his 
superiors, John Poindexter and President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
North did the nation a great service by telling us all this, and more, since 
our need to know about the bizarre goings-on in dark corners of an executive 
branch gone wild was greater than our need to prosecute North. 
</P>
<P>
North also did himself a great favor, of course; he "took the Fifth" when asked 
to testify before the committee, and then, being immunized and forced to 
testify, he bathed himself in this immunization in order to raise the question 
of contamination of evidence at any future trial. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been nice to read Bruce Fein, a constitutional scholar, on the 
question of how, if at all, government can both force testimony and also 
conduct a trial, within the construct of our Constitution.

COURT RULINGS ON OLLIE NORTH CONVICTIONS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oliver North may well get away with a reversal of convictions based on 
technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
The travesty is that North and his supporters will now self-righteously claim 
"vindication." This despite the fact that not only have the charges been found 
to be accurate, but only immunity kept him from being convicted on many other 
possible charges. 
</P>
<P>
He is, therefore, guilty, but free, thus giving "freedom" a fresh meaning. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that individual rights must be protected, but North's 
grinning manipulation of the government and the judicial system is an 
embarrassment to American values.

COURT RULINGS ON OLLIE NORTH CONVICTIONS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent decision (Part A, July 21) by two federal appeals court judges to 
suspend all three of Ollie North's 1989 felony convictions, and reverse one of 
them outright, underscores the old adage that life is full of irony. 
</P>
<P>
After the Iran-Contra scandal exploded in the press, Ollie North appeared 
before the congressional committees investigating that sordid affair, and "took 
the Fifth," so that his testimony could not later be used against him in the 
criminal prosecution that would follow. 
</P>
<P>
North and his arch-conservative supporters, who would later cheer when 
presidential candidate George Bush heaped scorn on the American Civil Liberties 
Union, had suddenly become civil libertarians themselves, true believers in the 
privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the 
United State Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
North's testimony demonstrated that, while he was a national security aide in 
the Reagan White House, he put our constitutional system of government at risk 
by operating what journalist Bill Moyers has called a "secret government," 
unaccountable to the American people, which kept the devastating Contra war 
going in Nicaragua after Congress cut off military aid to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
North then shredded the evidence of his activities in a futile attempt to 
conceal his wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one questions that North committed the acts for which he was 
convicted by a jury of his peers, two federal judges appointed by President 
Reagan now have doubts whether North's immunized testimony was somehow used to 
convict him. 
</P>
<P>
It is most ironic that a man like North, who all but shredded the Constitution, 
can benefit from the guarantees provided by that magnificent document. But that 
is the beauty of the constitutional system of government that he sought to 
undermine.

TOUGHER ODDS IN LOTTO GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had to smirk upon reading the article "Lawmakers Say Tougher Odds in Lotto 
Game Make It a Loser" (Part A, July 19). Now, there's a news bulletin! 
</P>
<P>
Now, the ivory-towered bureaucrats have come up with a new and improved way to 
widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Well, of course they would 
think that larger jackpots are better; they would play the lottery out of a 
sense of fun, not out of a sense of desperate, last-ditch hope. 
</P>
<P>
In the real world, the people who can least afford to buy lottery tickets, 
those classified as "poor," are the ones most likely to buy them. The lottery 
is now taking their money, but giving them much less hope in return. Who really 
needs $30 million; but can you imagine what $1 million or $2 million could do 
for a family that is just squeaking by on $18,000 or less each year? What would 
they do? Most likely, quit renting and buy a house, buy a car, invest for their 
children's education, and maybe go back to school themselves. They would buy 
things that most of us take for granted, such as new clothing and new 
furniture. Now, look at all the money that has just returned to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
But, instead of helping 20 to 30 families attain lives that most of us consider 
normal, they've decided it's good PR to give the whole aforementioned $30 
million to one mega-winner, and while I don't begrudge that winner the money, I 
think it's sad that the Lottery Commission can't see how very much good they 
could have done by taking away one or more numbers from the former 49-number 
field, instead of adding to it.

ARMS RESEARCH: UC MANAGEMENT OF LIVERMORE AND LOS ALAMOS IS AN ANACHRONISM 
HARMFUL TO UNIVERSITY VALUES. 
</P>

<P>
Should a university manage large-scale research and development of nuclear and 
sophisticated "conventional" weapons during peacetime? This will be the central 
question before the University of California regents at their September 
meeting, when they will decide whether to renegotiate the contracts under which 
the university operates the national weapons laboratories at Los Alamos and 
Livermore for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratories each have about 8,000 employees and a budget of $1 billion a 
year, of which 75% is used for military purposes and 25% for non-military work, 
such as energy research. The university's net management fee is about $7 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the end of World War II, contract renewal has taken place every five 
years rather routinely. This time the situation is different. Last October, a 
special faculty committee, following an intensive 2 1/2-year study, concluded 
that UC's management of the weapons laboratories was inappropriate in peacetime 
and recommended that it should be phased out in a timely and orderly manner. At 
the same time, the committee recommended maintaining cooperation between UC and 
the laboratories in non-military teaching and research. 
</P>
<P>
The faculties of each of the nine campuses have endorsed these conclusions by a 
convincing overall majority, 64% to 36%. A strong majority of undergraduate and 
graduate students have supported the same position. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty's recommendations rest on a number of preliminary findings, 
including the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- By the terms of the contracts, ultimate control of policies and programs 
rests (quite properly) with the government. The university thus acts as mere 
government agent, thereby surrendering its independence, one of its most 
essential values. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mission-oriented weapons research and development is far removed from the 
university's primary missions of teaching and independent research. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The university's full freedom of expression is incompatible with the 
necessary secrecy and other restrictions applying to weapons work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are satisfactory alternatives to UC management. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Collaboration between UC and the laboratories in non-military areas does 
not require UC to be the manager. (Currently, most of the laboratories' 
collaborations are with universities other than UC.) 
</P>
<P>
It should also be mentioned that, because of environmental pollution which has 
occurred under UC's management, the Livermore Laboratory has been placed on the 
Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund cleanup list. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the university administration, recently supported by a committee 
appointed by President David P. Gardner, has favored renewing the contracts. 
The president's committee sees the laboratory management as a public service 
and, while acknowledging that weapons R&amp;D is not a "normal" function of a 
university, seems little troubled by it. The committee paints a very bright 
picture for the future (unsupported by documentation) in which the 
laboratories' weapons work will decrease and the university will exercise 
substantial control in the non-weapons area. Curiously, it does not see the 
need for changes in the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that the committee's forecast is unrealistic, and if the contracts 
are renewed without major changes, the present unacceptable state of affairs 
will continue. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision is in the hands of the regents, who represent the general 
public of California. We believe that they will respect the position of the 
university's faculty and students. 
</P>
<P>
The state and the nation will be much better served if this great public 
university phases out an anachronistic management function and focuses its 
efforts on its primary missions of teaching and research, as well as on public 
service activities appropriate to a university. Weapons in peacetime just do 
not qualify.

The news from the state's real estate markets has been worrisome for several 
months, with the market slow and prices dropping about 3% statewide. But 
because California has never had a prolonged decline in real estate prices, 
people have been conditioned to think that prices will keep going up, despite 
this temporary dip. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that favorable economic trends in the state once kept propelling 
prices skyward. For most California homeowners, that house accounts for 60% to 
80% of total net worth. 
</P>
<P>
But homeowners in other areas that have suffered price meltdowns know it can 
happen in a flash. Just look at the Detroit Rust Belt; or Texas, Oklahoma, and 
Denver, areas still suffering the Oil Belt bust; or the depressed Midwest Farm 
Belt -- or, more recently, New England. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions are building in California for a similar meltdown that will make 3% 
look like nothing. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The faltering defense industry. Since World War II, more defense work has 
been awarded to California than any other state. It's one reason that during 
the past decade alone, California's population increased by 26%. But as the 
nation reaps its "peace dividend," California will surely suffer the most as 
defense contracts wind down and military bases are closed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tax selloffs. Since the tax law of 1986 was passed, taxing capital gains at 
the rate of ordinary income, many property owners have waited for these rates 
to be reduced before they sell property that has appreciated significantly in 
value. If federal budget negotiators settle on a capital gains reduction, which 
is entirely possible, more properties will be added to the already saturated 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Retirement selloffs. As the population of this area ages, many retired 
folks are learning that they can enjoy a much better life if they sell their 
expensive California homes and move to lower-cost areas. They can invest their 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital gains, $125,000 of which is 
tax-exempt for sellers over 55. If prices start to come down, even more will 
sell to protect the value of one of their major retirement asset -- the equity 
in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mega-mortgage burnout. A lot of recent home purchases have involved 
mortgages in the $300,000 range. These require monthly payments of almost 
$3,000 and are frequently assumed by two-earner couples. If a recession slows 
business, on top of defense cutbacks, some families may find it impossible to 
pay off their mortgages. Others may simply find it undesirable to pay if their 
mortgages begin to exceed the market value of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Overseas buyer slump. Yes, foreign capital has been buying up California, 
especially the Japanese. But to the extent that a lot of Japanese wealth is 
based on their stock market, the sharp drop in the Tokyo exchange may reduce 
demand for our real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Debt saturation. The high level of debt in America -- consumer, business, 
mortgage, and government -- is keeping the money supply tight. In addition, the 
end of the military buildup and its companion federal debt spiral could bring 
on a deflationary period that would erode real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Market shrinkage. Only a small percentage of Californians who don't already 
own homes can afford to buy one. And the population wave of the baby boom has 
peaked, which will further diminish the pool of potential first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The environmental factor. Environmental protection is now getting priority 
over further job creation. Some areas of the state are adopting policies that 
may discourage new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the caution light is flashing. There is no reason to be surprised that 
the savings and loan industry collapsed or that the junk-bond market has 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
As any student of financial history knows, markets are prone to periodic 
excesses. When the balloon is inevitably pricked, the latest comers to the 
party lose most. If only Donald Trump had heeded this advice six months ago.

IS THERE A REBELLIOUS STREAK HERE?;

<P>
SUPREME COURT: SOUTER CAME OF AGE AT THE DAWN OF THE '60S. DARE WE HOPE THAT 
HE'LL EVENTUALLY VOTE THAT WAY?

<TEXT>
<P>
I'd just been reading an interview with Justice William J. Brennan Jr. in the 
June issue of Irish America when the news came that he was hanging up his 
robes. What emerged in the interview was Brennan's consciousness of his 
family's roots in immigrant and labor struggles, even though his father 
eventually made it up the ladder, helping to capture Newark, N.J., from 
upper-crust control. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan's reminiscences are laced with a sense of history, a sympathy for the 
travails of ordinary humans. The young crowd on the Supreme Court doesn't look 
as though it spends much time thinking about what life looks like from the 
bottom end of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan described how his father, an Irish immigrant, got a job shoveling coal 
at Ballantine's brewery in Newark. He soon found conditions were very bad for 
the workers there, so, in his son's words, "he started organizing within 
Ballantine's and then spread around to the other breweries. . . . Remember, 
there were no trade laws to help you in those days. You just had to fight your 
way through." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan's father did well enough in this strike to rise in the ranks of 
organized labor around Newark. Next came a statewide trolley strike, eventually 
broken because the police moved against it at the behest of the powerful 
McCarter family that, as Brennan remembers, "really ran the state." In an 
effort to ward off a more sweeping onslaught on their power, the city bigwigs 
got Brennan's father appointed as a police commissioner, but "he promptly 
showed where he stood in the labor disputes and that led to one fight after 
another." In the end his father's forces "swept away the whole government" and 
his father ended up running the Department of Public Safety. This paradigm, 
that justice exists to serve everyone, evidently stuck with Brennan all his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
People poke through case decisions to try to figure out what a nominee to the 
Supreme Court will be like. Another, sometimes more reliable guide is the 
decade of birth and parental background. The old liberals, Brennan, Thurgood 
Marshall and Harry Blackmun, all turned 21 around the time of the stock market 
crash of 1929 and spent their early professional years watching the Depression 
gnaw through the country. Marshall's father, William, grandson of a slave, was 
a yacht club steward. Blackmun's father ran a hardware store in St. Paul. His 
son has recalled that they lived in a blue-collar neighborhood and "because I 
grew up in poorer surroundings, I know there's another world out there that 
sometimes we forget about." 
</P>
<P>
The next age cohort of justices are Byron White, John Paul Stevens and William 
Rehnquist, born respectively in 1917, 1920 and 1924. White, a law-and-order 
justice, had a dad in the notoriously anti-union lumber business. Alpha White 
also served as mayor of Wellington, Colo. Stevens, as a justice somewhat of a 
liberal individualist, was the son of a wealthy businessman and grew up in 
Chicago's affluent Hyde Park. Chief Justice Rehnquist spent his childhood in a 
well-to-do suburb of Milwaukee (which had a socialist mayor in the 1930s). His 
father, William, was a wholesale paper salesman who never attended college. His 
mother had a bachelor's degree. These parents instilled in young William a 
reverence for Hoover, Landon, Wilkie and Taft. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Ronald Reagan's appointees -- Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia 
and Anthony Kennedy -- all turned 21 in the swell of the Eisenhower '50s when 
the tide still purported to lift all boats. O'Connor's father was a rancher in 
the Southwest. Scalia's father, Eugene, was a professor of romance languages 
who had immigrated from Italy. Kennedy's was a Catholic Republican lawyer and 
lobbyist well-known in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
It could be that from the liberal point of view, the great loss to the court 
was Douglas Ginsburg, Ronald Reagan's failed nominee after the Robert Bork 
debacle. Here was a child of the '60s who turned 21 in 1967, who left Cornell 
for a year to run a dating service, who smoked at least one joint at Harvard. 
His father, Maurice, was a mortgage financier, which always offers insight into 
the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
And David H. Souter, George Bush's nominee? He celebrated his 21st birthday in 
the year that Richard Nixon lost the presidential race to John F. Kennedy, at 
the dawn of the rebellious decade. His father was a banker. The family moved 
from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. It doesn't seem good for liberals. But 
there's always the encouraging shift of Blackmun, a Nixon appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Souter looks to me like a pressure cooker of psychic repression. Maybe he 
despised his father as a Nixon man and, if confirmed, will explode into 
judicial activism and spend the next half century getting his own back. Let's 
hope so. After the '60s, the soil that nurtured judicial greatness of the 
Brennan type looks thin indeed.

Another Calling: Former Watergate felon Jeb Magruder, 55, has been chosen as 
senior pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Lexington, Ky. The 
congregation's vote was 254-5. 
</P>
<P>
Magruder, who graduated from divinity school after his release from prison in 
1975, had been executive minister of a church in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>

Convicted: Patricia Kluge, estranged wife of billionaire John W. Kluge, was 
convicted Monday in Charlottesville, Va., of improper driving for swerving to 
avoid hitting an animal near her country estate. Mrs. Kluge was not seriously 
injured April 27 when her vehicle went 35 feet down an embankment and flipped 1 
1/2 times. Her lawyers argued the rural road is narrow and does not have 
shoulders, but the judge said people should not swerve uncontrollably for 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Whaddya Bid?: Pulitzer Prize-winning author Stanley Karnow agreed Monday to 
sign a contract with Bantam Books for "The Asianization of America." Karnow's 
agent said five major houses had been vying for the book in an auction. The 
former Washington Post and Time magazine reporter will be paid in the 
six-figure range. Karnow's biggest book was "Vietnam: A History," which is said 
to have sold 1 million copies.

JACK SMITH: VIVE LA DIFFERENCE? WOMEN WORK AS MEN TINKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not alone in my inquiry into the division of housework between husbands 
and wives, or men and women, if you like. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Carlson of Fullerton sends me an article from the Caltech News about a 
continuing research into the "technology" of housework by Ruth Schwartz Cowan, 
professor of history at State University of New York, who is on a fellowship 
this year at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Since her prize-winning 1983 book, "The Ironies of Household Technology: From 
the Open Hearth to the Microwave," the subject has been of increasing interest 
to other scholars, researchers and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
After 12 years of study, Cowan concluded that modern technology moved men out 
of the house, but did not make women's work easier. Men used to gather wood for 
the open hearth, process grain, make tools, brew cider and work in leather. 
Butchering was a communal chore. The industrial revolution ended all that. 
</P>
<P>
Men left the hearth to earn cash. The cook stove required more diversity of 
food preparation than the "one pot stew." Stoves had to be cleaned daily. 
Cotton fabrics required more washing. The sewing machine meant more work. 
</P>
<P>
To free themselves, Cowan believes, women must change some of the unwritten 
rules. Some rules -- changing sheets once a week, keeping sinks spotless -- may 
not really be necessary, she says. "Other rules," says the article's author, 
Winifred Veronda, " -- that men who dry dishes or change diapers are 
insufficiently masculine, for example -- ensure that women will continue to do 
more of the housework." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan concludes that we can best help the working wife "by helping the next 
generation -- and ourselves -- to neutralize both the sexual connotation of 
washing machines and vacuum cleaners and the senseless tyranny of spotless 
shirts and immaculate floors." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Cowan argues that antibiotics have eased the housewife's role as family 
nurse, and have done more than the dishwasher and the washing machine in 
freeing women to enter the work force. 
</P>
<P>
My wife has called my attention to "It's About Time," an article in the 
magazine France, subtitled "Statistics show what women have known all along -- 
they work more than men." 
</P>
<P>
The article, by Michel Faure, is based on a study by INSEE, a statistical 
bureau, on how the French spend their time. Though the tone is light, the 
conclusions are similar to those of Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
INSEE's findings, says Faure, "seem to bear out a sneaking suspicion we've been 
loath to admit: Namely, that when husbands come home after a day of toil, they 
plant their feet beneath the table as did their fathers and their fathers' 
fathers before them, and they ask their still-toiling wives the age-old 
question: 'What's for dinner, honey?' " 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that men are idle around the house. "When married men deign to lift a 
finger . . . it's not to do just anything. It's to tinker. Because males, well, 
males tinker. To trust tinkering to the delicate and fragile hands of the 
weaker sex would be flirting with disaster. . . . While the valiant tinkerers 
are busy hammering their thumbs . . . their wives are going about their 
'women's work' without a fuss. They are tending children, mending clothes, 
cleaning house, cooking meals and doing laundry. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea why my wife pointed out this article to me, except that it's 
true that I used to come home from work and say "What's for dinner?," meanwhile 
opening myself a beer. I no longer ask that question. I say "What's in the 
micro?" while I check the TV log for a sex and violence movie. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I have never been much of a tinkerer. I was always afraid of getting 
shocked or cutting a finger. So I am not the typical husband ferreted out by 
INSEE. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Roy, one of INSEE's researchers, emphasized the average Frenchman's 
uselessness around the house: "When he has a woman around -- regardless of 
whether she is his mother or his wife -- an employed man participates little in 
domestic work. The behavior of a husband and father vis-a-vis housework is 
basically the same whether his wife is employed or not, and whether they have 
one, two, three or more children." 
</P>
<P>
Faure ends with a curious finding by an INSEE sociologist: "Men who live with 
their partners devote more time to their professions than do men who live 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
"That'll go over real big with our wives," concludes Faure. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I think that finding ought to be reassuring to wives. I deduce from 
it that men who do not live with their partners spend a great deal of their 
time prowling. On the other hand, those who have their partners readily 
available -- when they aren't occupied with scrubbing the floor or cleaning the 
sink -- have more time to devote to professional pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Faure concludes: "Rest assured that old customs abide and timeworn 
conventions die hard. So do the differences between the sexes, which persist 
despite all the feminist demands and masculine goodwill, despite all the 
'superwomen' and 'new fathers.' " 
</P>
<P>
What it seems to mean to me is that Neanderthal women had it better.

NEW AND USEFUL: FANCY SWISS FAUCETS MAKE CONSERVING WATER MORE STYLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Lynn Simross welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for 
columns. But because of their volume, she regrets that she cannot respond 
individually to calls and letters. Write to Lynn Simross, Consumer Column, Los 
Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053.

<P>
Want to conserve water and cut your utility bill, too? Check out a line of 
faucets from Switzerland that allows consumers to pre-set the water flow and 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured by KWC, one of the world's oldest and largest kitchen and bathroom 
fittings firms, the faucets can save from 33% to 50% in water, depending on 
which of three different settings is chosen. The fixtures are contemporary in 
design and are available in brass-coated, with an oven-baked enamel in white, 
almond, black, gray and red, or in chrome. 
</P>
<P>
The KWCdomo is a single-lever kitchen faucet with a device under the lever to 
limit how high it goes, and, thus, the amount of water that comes out of the 
faucet. Adjusting the setting is simple; "all you need is a flat-head 
screwdriver," said Reed Fry of KWC in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The KWCdomo and bathroom basin faucet cost about $250; a shower miser valve 
costs about $350. 
</P>
<P>
They are available nationwide in selected kitchen and bathroom showrooms, and 
in plumbing and hardware stores. In Southern California, they can be found at 
Snyder Diamond plumbing in Torrance, Pasadena, Santa Monica and North 
Hollywood, or at the 20 area Familian Bath and Kitchen Centers. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't locate them in your area, contact KWC/Western States Manufacturing 
Corp., 1559 Sunland Lane, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626; (800) 777-9762.

A 'Miracle' Match for Stubborn Stains 
</P>
<P>
Sherry's Miracle Stain Solution is a nontoxic, water-based stain remover for 
carpet and upholstery. It can be used on clothing and deodorizes the soiled 
area as it removes stains, its distributors say. 
</P>
<P>
Cye and Sherry Markowitz, of North Hollywood, say Sherry's Miracle will remove 
pet stains; blood; food; grass; iodine; beverages such as coffee, tea or wine; 
ketchup; grease; oil; most shoe polish; crayon; latex paint; chocolate, and raw 
egg if used as directed. To remove a stain, apply a few drops with a clean 
terry cloth towel and rub the stain, then blot with the dry part of the towel. 
</P>
<P>
The product should be safe for all color-fast carpet and most upholstery 
fibers, but the manufacturers recommend testing it on an inconspicuous area to 
check for color-fastness. Most stains can be removed in seconds, they report. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry's Miracle costs $10, plus $2.50 shipping and handling for the 16-ounce 
size, or $1.50 (50 cents shipping) for a 2-ounce trial size. To order, contact 
Sherry's Miracle, P.O. Box 201, 12115 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, Calif. 
91607; (818) 995-8503. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And, Now, a Few Words About the Weather 
</P>
<P>
If the summer heat's got you down, tack up Tacky Temp, a thermometer that makes 
jokes about the temperature. "Hot Enough to Fry Eggs on the Sidewalk" means the 
temperature is about 105 degrees Fahrenheit; "Broiling," 112; "Meltdown," 120. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first thermometer that tells you the real temperature in words 
everyone understands," said Barry Gottlieb, president of Mad Dog Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Middle ranges on the thermometer are "Pleasant," "Spring Thaw" and "Beach 
Weather." Come winter, you'll find readings that are "Totally Uncalled For" (0 
degrees Fahrenheit); "Too Cold for Words" (5 below zero), and "Frostbite City" 
(50 below). Tacky Temp is available nationwide in selected gift shops, or you 
can order it, for $3, including shipping and handling, from Mad Dog Productions 
Inc., P.O. Box 157, Richmond, Va. 23201; (804) 359-0001.

ORIGINALITY ROLLS IN ON A TIMELESS 'TIDE'

<P>
Los Angeles is once again in throes of dubious delight, calling itself 
America's second-most important art center and waiting nervously for somebody 
to laugh. That last happened in the '60s when the town dawned on the world as a 
hot-rod hotbed for flashy contemporary art. By now a lot of folks tend to think 
that time was the genesis if not the exodus of the whole L.A. enchilada. It 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Before there were Bengston Dentos, Bell boxes and elegant Irwin voids there 
were a couple of generations of lonely pioneers crying "Art!" in the 
wilderness. Lest we forget the Laguna Art Museum presents an unexpectedly 
important exhibition called "Turning the Tide: Early Los Angeles Modernists, 
1920-1956." 
</P>
<P>
On view to Sept. 16 and organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the 
show's catalogue essays raise larger questions about Los Angeles' cultural 
history. Has the town always been a philistine wasteland awash in the fleeting 
values of Hollywood? Is it a place with no sense of time, history or social

Some questions are more interesting than answers.

<P>
The 80-work exhibition is organized in such fashion as to have an odd, timeless 
quality. You can't tell when pictures were painted by looking at them. Tacked 
down, the dates could unmask them as provincial versions of styles invented 
elsewhere but there's a local-vintage twist to their look that saves them. At 
least some of them. Lacking chronological guidelines there is no way to judge 
except by quality. The work divides into pictures that stand up handsomely and 
those that have turned into quaint period pieces. 
</P>
<P>
But the show does prove there were at least 20 artists who took the avant-garde 
culture seriously when the Red Cars ran, the Richfield Building stood and Aimee 
Semple McPherson exhorted the faithful to pin their offerings to the velvet 
rope on the back of the pew. 
</P>
<P>
That's not very many but -- particularly during World War II -- there were 
high-level writers, musicians and filmmakers around from Thomas Mann and Igor 
Stravinsky to Jean Renoir and Aldous Huxley. Just how much cross-fertilization 
existed between the various arts is a question that's beginning to be answered 
when we learn that the L.A. avant-garde created contact between architect 
Richard Neutra, bookseller Jake Zeitlin, director Joseph von Sternberg, 
photographer Edward Weston and painters such as Lorser Feitelson and Stanton 
Macdonald-Wright, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The archly aristocratic Macdonald-Wright returned to Los Angeles in 1918 after 
inventing Synchronism in Paris and before a conversion to Oriental philosophy 
that would take him repeatedly to Japan. He became a linking figure symbolizing 
local absorption of European formalities and Zen spontaneity that remains 
operative to this day. Paintings on view look, naturally, like color-Cubist 
Chinese landscapes. Where but here could such exotic hybrids grow? 
</P>
<P>
For awhile Macdonald-Wright headed the local division of the WPA where he met 
Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundeberg, among others. They evolved "Post 
Surrealism," which exorcised Freudian weirdness and eventually involved Knud 
Merrild and Grace Clemens. The show finds the style evolving from Lundeberg's 
"Microcosm and Macrocosm" of 1937 to Feitelson's geometric-abstract "Magical 
Space Forms" of the '50s. For awhile he had a black-and-white PBS art-education 
show where he pushed the product with the fervor of a Madman Muntz car 
salesman. Pop culture meets cultivated culture. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of that and the supposedly nefarious influence of Hollywood, two of 
the most interesting artists on view both painted and made animated films, 
Oskar Fischinger and Jules Engel. Fischinger's painting, like a number of the 
others here, bounces around too much, but his jazzy abstract animated film 
looks great on videotape and has the artistic density we associated with great 
Bauhaus work. Eventually critic Jules Langsner would dub the growing tendency 
to T-square composition as an indigenous style called "Hard Edge Abstraction." 
It's best-known and most subtle practitioner was John McLauglin but the term 
acts as a magnet for artists with purist tendencies from Karl Benjamin and 
Frederick Hammersley to June Wayne and Peter Krasnow. His pastel hues capture 
that L.A. light that gives one the impression that all the buildings have been 
freshly painted while we were out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally there had to be a corrective to all this crisp purism. It came under 
the mantle of various forms of figurative Expressionism practiced by Hans 
Burkhardt, Rico Lebrun, Howard Warshaw and William Brice. His abstract 
landscapes hold up heroically but generally this is the hardest work to link up 
to our ideas about Los Angeles' cool hedonism. Maybe it proves that cities, 
like people, have lurking demons within. 
</P>
<P>
High on the list of Los Angeles' stereotypical quirks is its putative talent 
for fostering all manner of crackpot cults. That seriously suggests a lot of 
lonely people looking for something to believe in. Art itself has often been 
characterized as a kind of surrogate religion and several artists here betray 
specific leanings to mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Mullican has long been noted for work that links to the metaphysic of 
Southwest American Indian culture. Two others are figures that dwelled in 
obscurity until recently, Henrietta Shore and Agnes Pelton. Both bear generic 
resemblance to Georgia O'Keeffe's more abstract art. In this exhibition Pelton 
looks slightly more interesting in works that combine leanings to decadent 
symbolism with an exquisite execution that prefigures the best of Billy Al 
Bengston. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning the Tide" leaves us with provocative hints suggesting the truth of a 
long-held hunch that the L.A. artistic sensibility has a real, if slippery, 
originality that matches the weird uniqueness of the place itself.

Los Angeles is once again in throes of dubious delight, calling itself 
America's second-most important art center and waiting nervously for somebody 
to laugh. That last happened in the '60s when the town dawned on the world as a 
hot-rod hotbed for flashy contemporary art. By now a lot of folks tend to think 
that time was the genesis if not the exodus of the whole L.A. enchilada. It 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Before there were Bengston Dentos, Bell boxes and elegant Irwin voids there 
were a couple of generations of lonely pioneers crying "Art!" in the 
wilderness. Lest we forget, the Laguna Art Museum presents an unexpectedly 
important exhibition called "Turning the Tide: Early Los Angeles Modernists, 
1920-1956." 
</P>
<P>
On view to Sept. 16 and organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the 
show's catalogue essays raise larger questions about Los Angeles' cultural 
history. Has the town always been a Philistine wasteland awash in the fleeting 
values of Hollywood? Is it a place with no sense of time, history or social 
togetherness? If so did that sense of anonymity, immediacy and the ephemeral 
create a climate of creative freedom? Did it make Los Angeles a post-modern 
city decades before the term was invented? That's what essayist Paul Karlstrom 
thinks. He curated the show along with Susan Ehrlich and Barry Heisler.

UB40 Members Deported: Five musicians and two technicians from the British pop 
band UB40 arrested on suspicion of possessing marijuana will be deported from 
the Indian Ocean islands of Seychelles, police said Tuesday. Authorities said 
there was enough evidence to charge the seven, but they had decided to deport 
them instead. UB40 gave a concert Saturday and their performance was described 
by the islands' only newspaper, the Seychelles Nation, as a technical fiasco.

The Wrath of Bardot: Former film goddess turned animal rights champion Brigitte 
Bardot has assailed the Islamic world's ritual slaughter of animals as 
revolting and cruel. "It is revolting . . . and unacceptable that in the name 
of religion, man should submit animals to such cruel and barbarous sufferings," 
she said in an interview published Tuesday in France's weekly magazine Present. 
Bardot, 55, made her statement after seeing a film of the mass slaughter last 
month of 3,000 sheep by North African immigrants in the Mediterranean port of 
Marseille. ALEENE MacMINN

'ROSEANNE' WINS, NETWORKS TIE

Roseanne Barr may not have won any fans at the ballpark last week, but she 
still packed 'em in on ABC. Her comedy series was the week's most-watched TV 
program, according to ratings released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
It was seen in about 13.4 million homes. Of course, that was the night before 
she sang the National Anthem at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego. Meanwhile, 
ABC tied NBC in the weekly network race, as each posted an average 8.9 rating, 
compared to CBS' 8.4. The combined network ratings were the lowest since the 
weeks when the Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions 
were held in 1988. Together, the three attracted only 51% of the prime-time 
viewers for the week. The full list of ratings is on page F10. 
</P>
<P>
* Fox has enjoyed some major ratings successes in recent months with "The 
Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children," but two new series entries bombed 
in their first outings last Wednesday. "Glory Days" ranked last among the 
week's 90 prime-time programs and "Molloy" placed 89th. Each show was seen by 
only 5% of the people watching TV at the time. And "The Simpsons"? It finished 
20th with an episode being shown for the third time.

Show Goes On for Grateful Dead: The Grateful Dead will go ahead with planned 
shows despite the death last week of keyboard player Brent Mydland, and it is 
uncertain when a replacement for Mydland will be named. "It's possible that 
they'll start off (without a new member)," said publicist Dennis McNally of the 
tour that begins Aug. 31 with a three-night Bay Area stand in Mountain View and 
continues on the East Coast and in Europe. A report that Dead fan and friend 
Bruce Hornsby had been invited to join the band for some of the shows was 
labeled unfounded by both McNally and Hornsby's manager, Tim Neese. ALEENE

Bar None From Anthem: Comedienne Roseanne Barr coyly joins husband Tom Arnold 
and talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael in singing the National Anthem on 
Raphael's syndicated TV show that will air from sea to shining sea today (2 
p.m. on KCAL Channel 9). 
</P>
<P>
On the program, taped Monday in New York, Barr and Arnold try to set the record 
straight about Barr's controversial rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" 
last week before a San Diego Padres baseball game. Arnold, referring to 
President Bush's comment that Barr's singing had been "disgraceful," said, "I 
think the President should thank Roseanne. She took the spotlight off his new 
taxes and his son's savings and loan scandal." ALEENE MacMINN

THE SPIRIT OF DUKE ELLINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the name might have been a bit misleading (fewer than a third of the 
15-man Duke Ellington Alumni Orchestra were actually alums), the spirit of 
Duke, who died shortly after his 75th birthday in 1974, was enthusiastically 
brought to life under the direction of Herb Jeffries at the Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
Although few serious jazz listeners need any reminders of Ellington's 
importance as a leader or a composer, Jeffries, who sang with the orchestra 
between 1940 and 1942 and had a hit with "Flamingo," was sincere in his quest 
to restate the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it needs restating, however, as the 750 or so attendees were more 
interested in dancing Friday night than they were in listening to a quality 
effort diminished only slightly by the booming sound system of the 50-year-old 
Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when Ellington first introduced those tunes, many of which became 
immediate standards, he was leading a dance band. It was only later that 
Ellington was afforded the concert halls and studious attention given his 
European classical counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give something back to the earth," Jeffries said following the 
first set. "Without Duke, well, I don't know what would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, 50 years after "Flamingo," Jeffries' burnished baritone and 
sensitive phrasing are in good shape, his vibrato in firm control on up tunes 
like "Jump for Joy" and on the more demanding ballads like "Sophisticated 
Lady," to which he lent an attractive, seductive quality. 
</P>
<P>
In between came mighty instrumental efforts by an all-star band that included 
inspired solos by cornetist Bill Berry and trumpeter Snooky Young, saxophonists 
Marshall Royal, Teddy Edwards, Bob Cooper and Bill Green, trombonist Buster 
Cooper and pianist Art Hillary. The rhythm section of bassist Monty Budwig and

DODGER CHARGE SLOWED; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DEFENSIVE LAPSES KEY REDS' 5-2 VICTORY. LOS ANGELES FALLS EIGHT GAMES 
BEHIND AGAIN.

In order to truly catch pennant fever, the Dodgers learned Tuesday, you must 
first catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Like an aspiring beauty queen whose blemishes show up under pressure, the 
Dodgers displayed a defense against the Cincinnati Reds that made the 42,242 
fans at Dodger Stadium blush. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels overran a fly ball. Mike Scioscia missed a pitch. Mike Sharperson 
missed a grounder. Three mistakes, three runs. It was all the Reds needed in a 
5-2 victory that ended their losing streak at eight games while stopping the 
Dodgers winning streak at five. 
</P>
<P>
"What good teams do is take advantage of mistakes, and tonight they did just 
that," said pitcher Tim Belcher, who gave up just five hits in seven innings 
but fell to 9-8. "I felt I could cover up some of our miscues with a big 
fastball, but I didn't have it. If we are going to get back into this race, we 
have to make the plays . . . and pitch well and hit well." 
</P>
<P>
Added Scioscia: "For us not to give Tim support in a big game like this is 
discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
This sort of defense is not completely unusual: The Dodgers have made more 
errors than all but four other National League teams this season. But Tuesday 
night, with the third-place Dodgers having a chance to move to within six games 
of the first-place Reds, it stuck out like a fielder with no glove. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the darned thing about it. We just snapped a five-game winning streak, 
but it caused a two-game swing in the standings. It was like losing three games 
instead of one," said Belcher, whose team trails the Reds by eight games and 
second-place San Francisco by 2 1/2. "Now the Reds go home for a month while we 
go on the road for a month." 
</P>
<P>
His calendar is inexact, but his point his clear. After tonight's makeup game 
here with San Francisco, the Dodgers embark on the season's longest trip, 
covering 15 games in 15 days in four cities. The first seven games of the trip 
are in San Francisco and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
And they might be forced to do it without second baseman Juan Samuel, who left 
the clubhouse on crutches Tuesday after spraining his ankle while trying to 
beat out a bunt in the fourth inning. He will undergo X-rays today. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds scored one run in the first inning after Hal Morris started the game 
with a triple that a hustling Daniels overran in left field. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dodgers tied it, the Reds scored another run in the third inning 
after pitcher Jose Rijo singled and eventually moved to third on a passed ball 
by Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
Then, leading 3-2 in the fifth, the Reds scored on an error by second baseman 
Sharperson, who had just entered the game after Samuel departed. 
</P>
<P>
The game essentially ended in the seventh inning in frustrating fashion, as 
Daniels' three-run home run trot after he hit a 395-foot fly ball was 
interrupted by Eric Davis' catch at the center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels turned his trot into a dance of anger. He leaped and shouted around 
first base while the Reds ran off the field with two Dodger runners stranded 
and a 4-2 lead intact. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit it square . . . it just didn't do out," Daniels said. "I think it would 
have broke the Reds' back." 
</P>
<P>
Instead the Reds, who shook up their clubhouse with some interesting maneuvers 
including a revamped lineup, are feeling lucky again. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a few breaks, and we took advantage of them," Manager Lou Piniella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rijo pitched 6 1/3 strong innings, giving up two runs on six hits. Randy 
Myers pickedup his 21st save. . . . Jim Neidlinger (pronounced NYDE-linger) 
arrived at Dodger StadiumTuesday acting surprisingly calm for someone who will 
make his first major league start today in the middle of a pennant race. "I 
know what's going on," Neidlinger, 25, said. "If youfollow baseball in the 
newspapers you know what is going on, but I'm not thinking about it. Ilook at 
it like, I'm just going out trying to win a game. Nothing more." Neidlinger 
said this attitude comes from enduring the rigors of seven minor league 
seasons. "I've already been through a lot of ups and downs," Neidlinger said. 
"Unfortunately, I've played in a lot of minor-league games, and I've learned a 
lot of things. I do what I'm capable of doing, and usually things turn out all 
right." Neidlinger is known as a sinkerball pitcher with good control. He 
walked 34 in 119 2/3 innings in triple-A Albuquerque while going 8-5 with a 
4.29ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morgan's right ankle was feeling better Tuesday, and he said he will 
likely make his scheduled start Saturday in San Francisco. Morgan turned the 
ankle while covering first base in the ninth inning of his two-hit, 4-1 victory 
over Cincinnati Monday. . . . The leading candidates to replace Ben Wade as 
Dodger scouting director are Wade's assistant, Terry Reynolds, and scout Mel 
Didier.

STEINBRENNER SELECTS HIS SON; 
</P>
<P>
YANKEES: OWNER'S SUCCESSOR IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF TEAM'S PARTNERSHIP AND 
OTHER MAJOR LEAGUE OWNERS.

<P>
He wasn't at his job on the horse farm in Ocala, Fla., nor at a nearby high 
school where he used to coach the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, one day after his father was forced to give up control of the New York 
Yankees, Hank Steinbrenner was "en route somewhere" according to a fellow 
employee at the Kinsman Stud Farm, a 860-acre business owned by Hank's father, 
George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
But that route became more specific Tuesday afternoon, when Steinbrenner chose 
his 33-year-old son to take control of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"For some years now I have been preparing to turn over the operation of the 
Yankees to my sons and sons-in-law," Steinbrenner said in a prepared statement. 
"My son Hank, subject to league approval, will become general partner at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent permanently removed Steinbrenner from 
control of the team for his involvement with a gambler, Howard Spira. 
Steinbrenner can only be involved in major decisions for the team, specifically 
negotiating television and lease contracts, and can have no involvement in 
day-to-day activities or any player transactions effective Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, however, has stipulated in his ruling that the new general partner can 
be a member of Steinbrenner's family, subject to approval by the Yankee 
partnership and major league club owners. No further approval from Vincent is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
But the baseball business won't be new to the young Steinbrenner. In 1986, his 
father brought him to New York from Florida to learn the team operations. Hank 
Steinbrenner spent a lot of time with then-Yankee General Manager Clyde King. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a bright young man, sharp fellow, with great retention and he learned 
quickly," said King, who also managed the Yankees and is now a special adviser. 
"I was surprised he knew a lot about baseball -- the history of game. He read 
box scores every day and knew the players and averages. 
</P>
<P>
"And he was an athlete, though he's too modest to tell you that. One day I 
remember he went down and took some swings with Woody Woodward, who was my 
assistant at the time. Woody hit one out of Yankee Stadium, and I think Hank 
did, too." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner attended Culver Academy, a military school near South Bend, Ind., 
which his father also attended. He then went to Central Methodist College in 
Fayette, Mo., where he majored in history and political science and played on 
the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
He is currently living in Ocala, where he runs the horse farm and last season 
coached the Vanguard High soccer team. But recently Hank Steinbrenner talked 
about moving to Tampa to work at his father's other company, American Ship 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about Hank coming back this year to coach soccer, but he said he was 
not sure because he may be moving to Tampa to work with his father's business," 
said Ken Vianello, principal of Vanguard High. "But now, well, unless he wants 
to run my soccer team instead of the New York Yankees -- there would be less 
pressure, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Steinbrenner, should he be approved by two-thirds of the 19 partners in 
the organization's partnership and by major league baseball, will have his work 
cut out for him. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees currently have the worst record in baseball. The team is last or 
close to it in every statistical category in the American League and headed for 
100 or more losses for the first time since 1912. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, they have used 157 players. Only Don Mattingly and Dave Righetti 
remain from the 1986 spring roster. And the 1980s was the first decade since 
Babe Ruth's acquisition in 1920 that the Yankees did not win a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Since George Steinbrenner purchased the club in 1973 there have been 18 
managerial changes, 12 general managers and 23 pitching coaches. And things 
haven't been much better off the field. At least 20 Yankee scouts quit between 
1983-87. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Steinbrenner has apparently already been involved in some major team 
decisions. In 1986, Hank was said to have been a major factor in the signing of 
Lou Piniella as manager. And his honesty about the business was recognized 
quickly by those who worked with him. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think would really help this team?" King asked Hank a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Get rid of my father," Hank said. 
</P>
<P>
Should Hank Steinbrenner become the general partner, his father will not be 
allowed to ask him how his work is going. In the stipulations of Vincent's 
ruling, Vincent banned the Yankee owner from any involvement with the team, 
including talking to anybody in the Yankee organization about the team or 
baseball. Violations of the ruling could result in further penalties for 
Steinbrenner and the person he talks to. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's attorney, Stephen Kaufman, said he was confident Hank would be 
approved as general partner. Barry Halper, one of the most active limited 
partners, agreed. "I'm sure it will be Hank unless Hank doesn't want it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEINBRENNER RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
<P>
Details of the restrictions on New York Yankees and their principal owner: 
</P>
<P>
WHAT HE CAN DO 
</P>
<P>
He may participate in major financial decisions of the Yankees. Player 
signings, free-agent contracts and hiring and firing the manager are not be 
considered major decisions. 
</P>
<P>
He may request permission in writing to attend a limited number of major league 
games beginning next season. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT HE CAN'T DO 
</P>
<P>
He may not attend, vote or participate in major league meetings. He may not 
make personnel decisions. He may not own 50% or more of the team's stock. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT YANKEES MUST DO 
</P>
<P>
For five years, they must seek the approval of the American League president 
for the hiring, firing, promotion, demotion or reassignment of any officer of 
the club; any court litigation or arbitration (other than salary) against a 
major league player or the retention of outside counsel or private 
investigators for any matter relating to a major league player.

BLACK ACCEPTED BY SHOAL CREEK; PROTEST CURBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

<P>
Six weeks after founder Hall Thompson declared his all-white country club 
immune to outside racial pressures, the Shoal Creek board of governors 
reluctantly welcomed a black to its membership Tuesday and began processing the 
application of one other black, thus averting a planned protest of the upcoming 
PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was announced in the Birmingham city council chambers by 
Mayor Richard Arrington, ended a series of tense negotiations between 
representatives of Shoal Creek, the PGA of America and the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. The SCLC had vowed to set up picket lines at the country 
club unless, among other demands, a black was invited to join Shoal Creek 
before the beginning of the Aug. 9-12 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassed by public outcry, pressured by both the PGA of America and the SCLC 
and stung by the defections of national television advertisers, Shoal Creek its 
first black member in its 13 years of existence. An honorary membership was 
extended to and accepted by Louis J. Willie, president of a local insurance 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Willie is familiar with such controversies. He was the first black member of 
The Club and The Downtown Club, two exclusive Birmingham business 
organizations. When contacted Monday by Arrington about accepting Shoal Creek's 
offer, Willie said he didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my decision while I was on the phone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By granting an honorary membership, Shoal Creek spared Willie the cost of its 
$35,000 initiation fee and an application process that takes as long as six 
months. More to the point, Shoal Creek also spared itself picket lines and more 
bad publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"The actions of the board are consistent with the stated membership policies 
and bylaws of Shoal Creek," said John Pittman, president of the club's board of 
directors. "The Board felt it was in the best interest of all involved to 
expand our minority membership." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed further about the circumstances involving Willie's selection, Pittman 
chose understatement. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us just say we thought the time was right for us to make a decision at 
this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie has full access to the club and its facilities, but there remains some 
question about his ability to nominate potential candidates for membership. 
Pittman said Tuesday he was unsure if it took "one or two" members to offer 
someone for club consideration. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the SCLC's choices for membership -- Birmingham attorney Donald 
Watkins and public accountant Jim White -- were not extended invitations. And 
while Pittman said it was against club policy to reveal the names of 
prospective members, a source familiar with Shoal Creek revealed that neither 
Watkins nor White was the other black whose application was currently being 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, SCLC leaders seemed less concerned with names than with numbers. Not 
only did Joseph E. Lowery, SCLC national president, and Birmingham chapter 
president Rev. Abraham Woods want a black member before the tournament's 
beginning, they also wanted a black to be included in the normal interview 
process. Both conditions were met. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked that two prominent businessmen (Watkins and White) . . . be asked," 
Woods said, "but we're not choosy about that. We understand that the process 
has been started." 
</P>
<P>
Woods also said that he has received assurances from Pittman that the 
application process might be expedited, from six months to three. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek wasn't the only one that was forced to examine its practices. The 
agreement also requires the PGA of America to recommend to its board of 
directors that future PGA Championships be played at clubs with 
non-exclusionary membership rules. Jim Awtrey, chief executive officer of the 
PGA of America, said the proposal will be ratified next Wednesday and that a 
new policy will be announced at that time. 
</P>
<P>
If so, then at least two of the four announced championship sites could be 
affected by the new mandate. 
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Aronimink Golf Club, near Philadelphia, site of 
the 1993 PGA Championship, an unwritten policy of discrimination similar to 
that of Shoal Creek's exists. There also are no black members at Crooke Stick 
Golf Club in Carmel, Ind., site of next year's championship; at Bellerive 
Country Club in St. Louis, site of the 1992 event, and at Oak Tree Golf Club in 
Edmund, Okla., site of the 1994 tournament. Oak Tree also doesn't include women 
as members. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Awtrey only would say that discussions with those four clubs were 
ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
Awtrey also told Lowery that the PGA of America would be willing to discuss 
possible programs aimed at improving black participation in the game, as well 
as the business of golf. Lowery wants to see more blacks involved in every 
aspect of sport, from the PGA Tour to the various golf administrative staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Similar meetings are expected to take place with representatives of the PGA 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this equally important," Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be determined is the impact of Shoal Creek's new policy on those 
advertisers who canceled or reduced their commercial participation in ABC and 
ESPN tournament broadcasts. At last count, Toyota and IBM had pulled its ads, 
while Delta had curtailed the number of commercials it will air. 
</P>
<P>
"We called ABC and told them that the controversy had been resolved," said Joe 
Steranka, senior director of marketing and promotions for the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
Steranka said he doesn't know if the three advertisers will now reconsider 
their decisions.

MILESTONE: HE THROWS 146 PITCHES AND NEARLY SEES 5-1 LEAD WASTED BEFORE RANGERS 
SECURE HIS BIGGEST VICTORY, 11-3.

Nolan Ryan, that Old Man River of pitchers, kept rolling along for the better 
part of eight innings at Milwaukee County Stadium Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming his own slow start and some minor league fielding by his teammates 
in the late innings, Ryan and the Texas Rangers beat the Milwaukee Brewers, 
11-3, as the 43-year-old right-hander became the 20th pitcher to win 300 games. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristic of his 24-year career, Ryan gave more than he got. With a 5-1 
lead in the eighth, he pitched well enough to get six outs, but Julio Franco 
botched two double play balls around second base, forcing the indefatigable 
Texan from the game. 
</P>
<P>
After the Brewers scored twice, cutting their deficit to 5-3, Brad Arnsberg 
came out of the bullpen to get the last four outs and give Ryan the victory 
that eluded him last week at home against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom has a home crowd rooted so hard for a rival. When Ryan gave the ball to 
Arnsberg and walked off the mound, the more than 55,000 who crammed into this 
creaky old hunk of concrete gave him a standing, roaring ovation. There were so 
many flash bulbs flashing from the crowd that it looked like the Fourth Of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan went into the game with a record of 10-4 and career totals of 299-267. He 
pitched 7 2/3 innings, giving up three runs -- one earned. He struck out eight 
and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved that it's over," Ryan said. "The last 15 days have been 
emotionally tough as any I've ever gone through. I didn't want this (the quest 
for No. 300) to be an ongoing deal. For me, 300 means relief." 
</P>
<P>
Franco was relieved, too, in the ninth, when he hit the third grand slam of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
After Franco's first error, on a grounder hit near the bag by Robin Yount, the 
Brewers had runners at first and second and nobody out. Ryan got Gary 
Sheffield, a .380 hitter in July, to pop up. Dave Parker's grounder to Franco's 
left went off his glove, into right field, scoring a run. Greg Vaughn fouled 
out, but after Jim Gantner singled to left, scoring another run and leaving 
runners at first and second, Manager Bobby Valentine called for Arnsberg, who 
needed only two pitches to retire Mike Felder. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan threw 146 pitches. "This game was tough on me physically," he said. "I 
knew that the eighth inning was going to be my last no matter what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has pitched six no-hitters, but for four innings Tuesday night the no-hit 
pitcher was Chris Bosio, the Milwaukee starter. 
</P>
<P>
Bosio lost the no-hitter and a 1-0 lead in the fifth. Singles by Ruben Sierra 
and Harold Raines and a walk to Pete Incaviglia loaded the bases with none out. 
Geno Petralli hit a sacrifice fly, Steve Buechele singled to score a run and 
Jeff Huson's shot past a diving Felder in right field went for a two-run 
triple, giving the Rangers a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was trying to keep from throwing too many pitches, but the first four 
innings didn't work out that way. The only damage, however, came in the third, 
when Paul Molitor's single and Yount's triple gave the Brewers a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle innings were the key to the game," Ryan said. "At the start, I 
didn't have command of my fastball, and Milwaukee is a fastball-hitting team. 
They were fouling off a lot of my pitches. In the middle innings, I had a 
better fastball and that let me get ahead on the counts." 
</P>
<P>
After Buechele made a throwing error to give Charlie O'Brien a life at first 
base to start the Milwaukee fifth, Ryan retired seven consecutive hitters 
before walking Felder in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas ninth came at the expense of relief pitchers Paul Mirabella, Mark 
Knudson and Tony Fossas. 
</P>
<P>
Incaviglia started the inning with his 17th homer. A walk, a bunt single and an 
error loaded the bases, with Huson's single driving in one run. Then Franco hit 
Fossas' first pitch into the left field seats. As Franco circled the bases, it 
was a toss-up whether the second baseman or Lynn Nolan Ryan Jr., sitting in the 
dugout, was the most relieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't relax until we got the grand slam," Ryan said.

Chris Evert came to the defense of her good friend and old rival Martina 
Navratilova and chided former tennis great Margaret Court for suggesting that 
Navratilova was a bad role model for young players because she is gay. 
</P>
<P>
"Martina has been a role model for me," Evert said. "I think Martina's been one 
of the most professional tennis players just in the way she changed herself in 
the last 10 years physically, mentally and emotionally to be a champion. 
</P>
<P>
"We should judge her on what she did on the court, not in her private life."

But because of a backlog in serving misdemeanor sentences, that probably will

BRUCE DAVIS JOINS RAIDERS IN LONDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offensive tackle Bruce Davis rejoined the Raiders Tuesday, after a two-year 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who played for the Raiders from 1979-87, was traded to the Houston 
Oilers in 1988, where he played the last two seasons. He was waived by the 
Oilers in the off-season and signed with the Raiders as a free agent. He joined 
the team in London, where the Raiders will play the New Orleans Saints in an 
exhibition game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders cut tackle John Layfield, a rookie free agent from Abilene 
Christian, to make room for Davis.

National pride took a beating when a bunch of United States collegians ran into 
the two best amateur basketball teams in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's time for the United States to roll out its own powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. women's basketball team began its Goodwill Games tournament Tuesday 
night with a 94-70 victory over South Korea, just two weeks after winning its 
second consecutive world championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were a little tight," U.S. Coach Theresa Grentz said. "But I was 
pleased with our defensive pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The team features several veteran players, including one who has played 
professionally with the Harlem Globetrotters and in Europe -- 30-year-old 
co-captain Lynette Woodard. 
</P>
<P>
The United States won the bronze medal in baseball with a 10-4 victory over 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Fabregas had a single, double and triple, and Darren Bragg drove in three 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba defeated Japan, 6-1, for the gold medal as Jorge Valdes pitched a 
four-hitter and Antonio Pacheco hit two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba, winners of 19 of the last 22 world championships, hit four home runs, 
including three in a row in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
The other American team to find success was the men's volleyball squad, which 
beat the Soviet Union, 8-15, 15-13, 17-16, 9-15, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
Super-heavyweight Larry Donald of Cincinnati stopped Wolfgang Haas of West 
Germany at 2:59 of the third round in boxing, while Edward Escobedo of 
McKinney, Tex,, was beaten, 5-0, by Vasile Dumitroaie of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. featherweight champion Oscar de la Hoya of Los Angeles, 17, the youngest 
boxer in the tournament, stopped Lee Sang-Hun of South Korea at 2:55 of the 
third round. 
</P>
<P>
But Edward Escobedo, the U.S. champion at 201, lost a three-round decision to 
Vasile Dumitroaie of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Robinson of Philadelphia, won a 4-1 decision over Kirkor Kirkorov of 
Bulgaria at 125 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the light-middleweights, Paul Vaden of Puyallup, Wash., beat Alexander 
Kunzler of West Germany, 3-2. Chris Byrd of Flint, Mich., lost, 3-2, to Torsten 
Schmitz of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a 16-8 record in three days of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Norwood of Bryan, Tex., won the women's gold medal in the modern 
pentathlon with 5,288 points after a day in which she placed first in the 
two-kilometer run, second in equestrian and tied for ninth in the 200-meter 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Second was Tatiana Chernetskaya of the Soviet Union, with 5,179 points. 
Kimberly Arata of Vandenberg, Calif., took the bronze with 5,130 points. 
</P>
<P>
In men's competition, Anatoli Starostin of the Soviet Union won the gold medal 
with 5,640.80 points. Rob Stull of the United States placed fifth with 5,342.35 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Gao Min of China won the women's 3-meter springboard diving gold with 525.78 
points. Kelly McCormick of Long Beach, was eighth, and Krista Wilson of Laguna 
Hills placed ninth.

CHANG WORN OUT, BUT HE WEARS DOWN DAVIS; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: WEARY FROM A BUSY SCHEDULE, FOURTH-SEEDED PLAYER WINS IN THREE SETS.

Michael Chang doesn't always mind if a first-round match requires him to play 
three sets. 
</P>
<P>
"If I win, I think it's OK," a weary Chang announced after outlasting Scott 
Davis, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, in an opening-round match Tuesday at the Volvo/Los 
Angeles tournament at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be known, though, the fourth-seeded Chang probably would have welcomed a 
less strenuous match or, even more to his liking, a day off. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Canadian Open Sunday at Toronto, his first tournament title 
since he suffered a freak hip injury last December while practicing in Florida, 
Chang caught a red-eye flight to Lake Tahoe, where Monday night he played an 
exhibition against Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
After the match, his original flight to Orange County was canceled, so he 
didn't arrive home in Placentia Tuesday until about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than 12 hours later, he was on the court against Davis, a native 
of Santa Monica who once was ranked 11th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty tired," Chang said afterward. "It was kind of difficult because I 
came in here expecting to play on a slow hardcourt. But for some reason, they 
resurfaced it and when I first hit a few balls out there, it was kind of like 
lightning and I was a little late." 
</P>
<P>
At the end, though, he was ahead of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott is a very dangerous player," Chang said of Davis, who has slipped in the 
rankings to 81st after peaking in 1985. "To get up to No. 11 in the world, the 
guy's got to be a great player. He hit some great shots today. He's the type of 
player who will take a lot of chances, and if he converts on those chances, he 
can be very, very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Or very sloppy. Davis made 50 unforced errors. "The difference might have been 
that Scott missed a little bit more," understated Chang, who had 17 unforced 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Krickstein, the defending champion, squandered two match points in the 
second set and a 4-2 lead in the third and was upset by Todd Witsken, 5-7, 7-6 
(7-4), 6-4. A former USC All-American, Witsken rallied after hitting an 
approach shot into the net, giving Krickstein double match point at 15-40 in 
the 10th game of the second set. After drawing a code violation for hitting a 
ball into the crowd, Witsken won the next four points to even the set at 5-5. 
Krickstein, playing his first match since June 19, when he aggravated an elbow 
injury and retired from a tournament at Manchester, England, blamed the loss on 
his long layoff. "Mainly, my arm just kind of got tired," said Krickstein, who 
withdrew from Wimbledon because of the elbow injury. "Maybe it was fatigue from 
not playing." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Stefan Edberg, playing in his first tournament since he won at 
Wimbledon, beat first-year pro Malivai Washington, 6-2, 6-4. "It's tough to 
play the first match after you won Wimbledon," said Edberg, who helped to draw 
a sellout crowd of 7,866 to the evening session. "Usually, you're on a high for 
quite some time. Now, you have to get down to basics and start working again. 
But I was quite pleased." . . . Third-seeded Pete Sampras beat Rick Leach, 7-5, 
6-3.

REDS INSPIRED BY CLOSE SHAVE BEFORE THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It took some hair-raising antics and a revamped lineup for the Cincinnati Reds 
to end their eight-game losing streak, 5-2, Tuesday at the expense of the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The six hits the Reds got Tuesday -- two of them by winning pitcher Jose Rijo 
-- may not qualify as a mugging, but the Reds were happy to get it, and willing 
to try drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, who have led the West from the first day of the season, were one-hit 
by San Francisco's Craig Lefferts on Sunday and two-hit by the Dodgers' Mike 
Morgan Monday. Afterward, Manager Lou Piniella said, "Morgan seems like he had 
good stuff. It seems like I'm saying something like that everyday about every 
pitcher we've faced on this trip." 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's loss, the Reds let their hair down. Ron Oester's, to be precise. 
Eric Davis shaved the second baseman's head in an attempt to change their luck, 
and teammates rubbed his skull. 
</P>
<P>
Along with some extra batting practice, Piniella tried a more traditional 
approach, shuffling his lineup. For Tuesday's game, Piniella tried Hal Morris 
leading off, Barry Larkin batting cleanup behind Davis, and Billy Hatcher 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, in his first full season, produced a double and triple and scored 
twice, and Larkin doubled and scored. "I just wanted to change things around a 
little bit," Piniella said. "My first intuition was to bat Rijo eighth. Maybe I 
should've. I like Morris in first. He has a good eye, he can run, he makes 
contact. There's nothing wrong with Morris hitting first." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who raised his average to .383, said he doesn't expect to bat leadoff 
often, but doesn't mind. "I like hitting anywhere," he said. "The thing about 
it is, you're only hitting leadoff once (in the game)." 
</P>
<P>
Rijo, who singled and scored in the third and singled and stole a base in the 
seventh, nominated himself as a possible candidate to bat first. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a four-game hitting streak, yes indeed. I'm hot," he said. "He might 
think about batting me leadoff next time." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella expressed more relief that the Reds are headed home after playing San 
Diego today than that the losing streak finally ended. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, I don't want to see a letdown," he said. "I view (today's) game 
as important or more important than (Tuesday's). It's important to go home on a 
winning note."

<P>
ORANGE COUNTY FAIR WANTS ITS SHARE OF PROFITS FROM SATELLITE WAGERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD McKINZIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Satellite betting has become a financial bonanza for just about every horse 
racing association in California and Norbert Bartosik wants in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
Bartosik is the general manager of the Orange County Racing Fair, a group which 
leases Los Alamitos Race Course three weeks out of the year to conduct an 
18-night race meeting. 
</P>
<P>
For the remaining 49 weeks of the year, Bartosik overseas the Orange County 
Fair at its home base in Costa Mesa. Among the activities during this time of 
year are such normal fairgrounds happenings as Sunday swap meets, car shows, 
equestrian shows and the yearly Orange County Fair with the usual livestock 
exhibitions, carnival rides and concerts. 
</P>
<P>
With annual revenues approaching $17 million, the Orange County Fair is a 
financial success under present conditions. However, Bartosik would like to see 
the Costa Mesa home of the fair become the newest location in California's 
statewide satellite betting network. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, the Orange County Fair is the only fair association 
prohibited from conducting satellite betting on California horse racing. That 
is a situation Bartosik has tried to change in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to introduce a bill this year to allow us to conduct satellite 
betting at the fairgrounds in Costa Mesa," Bartosik said. "We had to withdraw 
that bill for a number of reasons. Timing is everything in getting any new 
legislation and the timing just wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
A major factor in the Orange County Fair's decision not to pursue this new 
legislation was opposition from a home owner group in Costa Mesa which 
expressed concerns over such issues as increased traffic at the fairgrounds 
should the facility be open year-round for satellite betting. 
</P>
<P>
Also in opposition to the bill were several racing associations that fear the 
addition of the Orange County Fair to the satellite network would adversely 
affect their business. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their was a genuine misunderstanding on the part of our neighbors as 
to what satellite betting would mean to the area," said Bartosik. "As far as 
the racing industry, we had mixed support. It's always been a struggle for the 
Orange County Fair as far as racing goes and we know we need the support of the 
entire industry on this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Bartosik believes that satellite betting at the Costa Mesa fairgrounds could 
post numbers equal to the numbers recorded by Del Mar during its satellite 
betting programs. He also says that the addition of the Orange County Fair to 
the satellite network would not have a negative impact on such tracks as Del 
Mar and Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"If Del Mar averages between $700,000 and $800,000 on their satellite betting, 
I think we could do as well, if not better," says Bartosik. "The Costa Mesa 
market would be a separate market from Del Mar or Los Alamitos. We would 
attract a separate group of customers." 
</P>
<P>
Bartosik realizes that until the existing racing associations come to share his 
view that betting in Costa Mesa would not damage their own business, he will 
face a tough task gaining acceptance for satellite betting at the Orange County 
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I think increased satellite betting is the way of the future," says Bartosik. 
"When the rest of the racing industry is ready for us, we'll be ready for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
One jockey who figures to be the middle of the battle for this year's riding 
championship at the Orange County Fair is 19-year-old Corey Nakatani. 
</P>
<P>
A regular on the Southern California circuit at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and 
Del Mar, Nakatani opened his second meeting at the Orange County Fair with two 
winners in the July 30 opening night. 
</P>
<P>
One of Nakatani's victories on opening night came with the 2-year-old filly 
Theresa's Pleasure, a member of the Bob Baffert barn who equaled the Los 
Alamitos 4 1/2-furlong track record with a very impressive 50 3/5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
For Nakatani, the Orange County Fair meeting is just another stop on his quest 
to break into the group of leading riders on the tough Southern California 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be in the top 10 at every meet I ride and then I want to be number 
one someday," Nakatani said between his opening night victories at Los 
Alamitos. "Last year I had the bug (the five-pound weight allowance given 
apprentice jockeys) and now I want to prove I can win just as many races 
without it. I didn't win 200 races with the bug for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Riding at Los Alamitos during the fair is a different situation for Nakatani. 
The track is a five-eighths mile oval with much sharper turns and a shorter 
stretch than Santa Anita, Hollywood Park or Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming adjusted to this smaller oval is a major hurdle for many riders who 
venture to Los Alamitos for the fair meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I rode here last year and it took me four or five rides to get used to the 
smaller track," said Nakatani. "You just have to ride with a lot of confidence 
on this track. You have to ride the horses the way they like to run. You can't 
force them to lead." 
</P>
<P>
Nakatani and his wife, Michele, are the parents of a one-month old daughter, 
Brittany Marie. Nakatani doesn't figure he loses much sleep racing during the 
Los Alamitos night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"With a one-month old baby at home, I wouldn't be getting any sleep anyway," 
Nakatani says. "I might as well be here at night racing." 
</P>
<P>
Topping this weekend's racing schedule at the Orange County Fair will be the 
$35,000 Las Palmas Stakes for fillies and mares on Friday night and the $35,000 
added Costa Mesa Stakes on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Among those considering the Las Palmas Stakes on Friday are connections of the 
defending champion, Keep On Top, a 5-year-old mare with just over $121,000 in 
lifetime earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Keep On Top won last year's running of the Las Palmas by more than six lengths, 
but has been winless in six starts since that victory. 
</P>
<P>
Among those nominated to the Costa Mesa Stakes is El Camino Real Derby winner 
Double Quick, a member of the Mel Stute stable with over $444,000 in career 
earnings.

TUDOR BEATS PHILLIES TO EXTEND STREAK TO 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All season long the Dodgers have searched for a fifth starter. They rejected 
John Tudor, the left-hander who has kept the St. Louis Cardinals from 
collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers rejected Tudor, who missed most of last season because of 
elbow and shoulder problems, he signed as a free agent with the Cardinals. At 
the time no one, including Tudor, knew whether he could even pitch. 
</P>
<P>
There is no longer any doubt. Although his best fastball rarely exceeds 80 
m.p.h., he is a 10-game winner on a last-place team. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor (10-3) won his fifth in a row Tuesday night at Philadelphia as the 
Cardinals beat the Phillies, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor, who shut out Chicago in his previous start, had a two-hit shutout until 
the Phillies rallied in the eighth. Lee Smith, unscored upon in his last 15 
appearances, got the last five outs for his 17th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' Todd Zeile hit a two-run home run and Willie McGee extended his 
hitting streak to 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor pitched only 14 innings for the Dodgers last season after helping them in 
the pennant drive in 1988. He said he didn't know if he could still pitch, but 
he wanted to try. 
</P>
<P>
He is easily the leading candidate for comeback player of the year. He has made 
19 starts for the Cardinals and in all but one he has pitched at least five 
innings. In 13 starts for the low-scoring Cardinals, he has given up two or 
fewer earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to talk about any comeback honors," Tudor said. "Why? I just 
don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going from start to start, trying to get people out, keep this team 
in the game." 
</P>
<P>
McGee gave a reason for not wanting to talk about his hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you can say I'm superstitious," McGee said. "I kind of feel it will be 
bad news for me if I talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is played as a team and I'd like to keep it in that perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero was again out of the Cardinal lineup because of a bruised left 
foot. His status was listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 3, Houston 2 -- Don Robinson wasn't ready to pitch for the Giants 
in this game at San Francisco, but he won it for them. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, hit on the pitching hand last week, figured he needed one more day 
before returning to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
But with the bases loaded and no outs in the ninth, Robinson, one of the top 
hitting pitchers in the league, lined a single to left-center field to win the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Novoa, the replacement for Robinson, gave up six hits in 5 2/3 innings. 
Jeff Brantley wound up the winner, pitching two scoreless innings. Robinson 
expects to be ready to face the Dodgers tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants were without Kevin Mitchell for the third game in a row because of a 
sore hand. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 9, Chicago 1 -- The Pirates, who had lost four of their last five, 
started hitting again at Chicago and moved back into a tie for first place in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Bream hit a home run and drove in three runs, but most encouraging to the 
Pirates was the emergence from slumps by Andy Van Slyke and Bobby Bonilla. Van 
Slyke was two for three and Bonilla three for four. 
</P>
<P>
All was not joy for the Pirates. Bob Walk injured the middle finger on his 
pitching hand and left in the second inning. Bob Patterson pitched five shutout 
innings to improve to 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 7, New York 4 -- Oil Can Boyd pitched another strong game for the 
Expos at Montreal to beat the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd (6-3) gave up seven hits and walked two, but yielded only two runs in six 
innings. Since losing to Cincinnati April 28, Boyd is 5-1 with 10 no decisions. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 7, Atlanta 6 -- Dale Murphy hit a home run and drove in five runs at 
San Diego, but the Braves blew a 6-1 lead and lost when the Padres scored twice 
in the ninth. DAN HAFNER

ORIOLES' BIG GUY IS HELPING IN BIG MOVE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles are making an impressive effort to assure a three-team 
battle for the pennant in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
They might have just the man to lead them in 6-foot-7 right-hander Ben 
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when big pitchers are the vogue, McDonald is the newest sensation. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, in his third major league start, turned in his third sharp 
performance Tuesday night at Baltimore in a 6-4 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald went seven innings, giving up seven hits, but only two of the runs 
were earned. The loss dropped the Blue Jays into a tie with Boston for first 
place. The Orioles are four games behind. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Ripken hit a three-run home run in the first inning and gave the Orioles 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
It was not all that long ago that there was a place for 5-6 Bobby Shantz and 
5-8 Elroy Face. Those days are long gone. Scouts are looking for pitchers 6-4 
or taller. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Utterback of the Pittsburgh Press reported that there more than 20 
pitchers 6-4 in the majors this season who are showing winning form. 
Collectively they were posting a percentage of better than .700. That was 
before McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
In his second start last Friday McDonald beat the Kansas City Royals. He drew 
lavish praise from George Brett, a foremost authority on pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best stuff I've seen all year," Brett said after facing the big 
youngster. "I hope that was exceptional stuff for him and not so-so stuff. If 
that was an average night for him, a lot of hitters in this league are in 
trouble. He's already proven he's good by shutting out the White Sox. They're a 
good hitting team." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles have the best record in the league since the All-Star break. They 
finished July with a 17-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 7, Chicago 2 -- Manager Joe Morgan tried just about everything to get 
his hitters out of a slump. For the most part nothing worked and the Red Sox 
fell out of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
At last, he seems to have found a solution. He moved Wade Boggs, often derided 
for lack of run-producing despite a high average, to the No. 3 spot in the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three games Boggs has delivered one key hit after another. The Red 
Sox have won three in a row and Boggs is eight for 14. He has driven in six 
runs and scored three. 
</P>
<P>
He was three for five with an RBI in this game at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Brunansky and Tony Pena, came out of prolonged slumps in a four-run second 
inning that put the Red Sox in command. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky was zero for 34 before he got the first of three singles, while Pena 
was one for 23 before he singled. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Kiecker (4-1) allowed only one baserunner until one was out in the sixth, 
then was chased without retiring another batter. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 7, Oakland 2 -- Bill Swift blanked the Athletics for eight innings at 
Oakland to win his third start in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the defeat the A's remained three games ahead of Chicago in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (9-10), the former Mariner, is 0-2 with an ERA of 8.41 in four 
starts against Seattle. He didn't make it through the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 8, Cleveland 4 -- The Royals lost the hot-hitting Brett for a few 
days, but welcomed back another hitter, Danny Tartabull, at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull, just off the disabled list, hit two of the Royals' five doubles and 
drove in three runs to help young Kevin Appier improve his record to 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Brett suffered a bruised collarbone in a collision at first base in Monday's 
game. He was knocked flat by the Indians' Mitch Webster while catching a toss 
from pitcher Jeff Montgomery. Webster was out, but Brett was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
New York 10, Detroit 4 -- Mark Leiter, whose brother Al was a prize prospect 
for the Yankees a few years ago, won his first major league start in this game 
at New York. Leiter, 27, gave up eight hits in 7 1/3 innings in just his third 
major league game. 
</P>
<P>
Hot-hitting Roberto Kelly drove in two runs and scored two runs. Kelly also was 
the hitting star Sunday when the Yankees swept a doubleheader. DAN HAFNER

After five years of reinvigoration in the hands of a small group of investors, 
FAO Schwarz, the venerable purveyor of $4,500 life-sized stuffed giraffes and 
other luxury toys, said Tuesday that it had been sold to a Dutch retailing 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch firm, NV Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer (KBB), declined to disclose the 
purchase price. The selling group included Peter C. Morse, the chairman; Peter 
L. Harris, chief executive, and other investors and executives of the toy store 
who acquired it in 1985. FAO Schwarz said it expects its 1990 sales to exceed 
$50 million, up from $20 million in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is at least the fifth sale of FAO Schwarz and the second to 
European owners since the firm's founding family sold it in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Morse is expected to step down as chairman. But Harris and his management team 
are to remain, KBB said. In an interview, Harris refused to discuss terms of 
the sale. But, he said, "there would have been no reason to sell it if there 
wasn't a significant profit for the investors." 
</P>
<P>
Originally opened in Baltimore in 1862, FAO Schwarz, on Fifth Avenue, was for 
decades best known for being the most prestigious toy store in New York. It now 
also has a flagship store in San Francisco and 15 other outlets around the 
country, including one that opened less than two weeks ago in Beverly Hills and 
one in Orange County's South Coast Plaza. Additional stores are expected to 
open in Chicago, Boston and, eventually, Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's growth stagnated in the early 1980s, and its share of the toy retail 
market plummeted as it continued to concentrate on expensive luxury toys. 
Customers were intimidated by the high prices, and the toy market was 
increasingly dominated by mass retailers such as Toys R Us and discount outlets 
such as K mart Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But the group headed by Morse, a Philadelphia investment banker, and Harris, a 
Californian who is a former president of the Gemco retail chain, broadened FAO 
Schwarz's inventory to include a wider selection of lower-priced items, 
redesigned the stores, re-established a mail order catalogue and moved the New 
York store from its home of 50 years to roomier and more modern quarters in the 
General Motors building on Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The store's new home featured a one-minute shopping section -- where shoppers 
in a hurry could pick up already-wrapped gifts -- a hair salon for kids and 
plenty of display room for lower-priced, mass-market toys such as Barbie and GI 
Joe. There was room, as well, for FAO Schwarz's traditional fare -- life-sized 
stuffed animals, $500 rocking horses and toy sports cars that cost more than 
some real cars. The store also sought to provide an outlet for new, smaller 
entrepreneurial toy makers. 
</P>
<P>
KBB, a publicly traded company, had sales in 1989 of $1.67 billion and a profit 
of $43 million. KBB said FAO Schwarz is its first acquisition in the United 
States. It owns several retail chains made up of over 1,200 stores in Holland, 
Germany and Belgium, including the six-store upscale chain of De Bijenkorf 
department stores in Holland and M&amp;S Mode, a women's clothing retailer with 
more than 200 shops. 
</P>
<P>
Arie Maas, chairman of KBB, said in a written statement that "FAO Schwarz is 
the pre-eminent retailer of fine toys in the world, and we are committed to 
building on FAO's tradition of excellence." KBB said its strategy "is to 
acquire highly focused chains of specialty stores."

EX-ROCKWELL OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE MANAGER SET UP A PHONY MACHINE SHOP TO WIN A SUBCONTRACT. HE THEN 
DID BUSINESS IN A NON-APPROVED SHOP AND POCKETED THE DIFFERENCE.

A former Rockwell International Corp. purchasing supervisor pleaded guilty 
Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles to mail fraud and conspiracy to 
receive kickbacks in connection with a scheme to defraud the defense contractor 
on the B-1B bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Affinito, 49, of Rancho Palos Verdes, pleaded guilty to secretly setting 
up a sham machine shop in an effort to obtain subcontracts from Rockwell, where 
he was working as a supervisor in the parts purchasing department in El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Affinito admitted to U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. that he and a 
friend, Ward Finch, set up the phony machine shop, and Affinito provided Finch 
with information that enabled him to make successful bids for the 
subcontracting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Finch, in turn, subcontracted the actual work to unapproved machine shops. The 
scheme cost Rockwell more than $430,000, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. John 
F. Walsh III, who prosecuted the case with the help of investigators from the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Affinito is the 19th person to plead guilty to a felony uncovered during a 
multi-agency investigation of kickbacks in defense subcontracting. The probe is 
called DEFCON. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said Affinito set up the sham machine shop, called Draw Industries, with 
Finch, a real estate broker, in 1982. The prosecutor said Affinito doctored 
files to make it appear that a competitive bidding process had taken place 
when, in reality, the defendant had simply awarded the work to Draw at an 
inflated price. 
</P>
<P>
Affinito and Finch pocketed the difference between the inflated price paid by 
Rockwell and a cut-rate price charged by the real, though unapproved, machine 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
If the scheme had not been discovered, said Carlos Torres, an IRS investigator, 
it could have cost Rockwell "millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Dale Bibel said that, although no work was done by Draw Industries, a 
building was rented, machines obtained, time cards displayed, metal shavings 
strewn on a floor and temporary phony employees procured to deceive Rockwell 
officials when they came to examine Draw Industries. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the DEFCON cases were prosecuted in 1986 and 1987. The case against 
Affinito is only being resolved now, Walsh said, because it has a convoluted 
procedural history. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Affinito went to trial in 1987 on an indictment charging him with 
the Draw Industries scheme and a separate kickback scheme at Hughes Aircraft. 
He was acquitted on the Hughes charges but convicted of the Draw scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few weeks after the trial, however, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an 
opinion that struck down a number of mail-fraud convictions, including 
Affinito's.

owner of an independent Maryland Toyota distributorship. Weisman is suing 
Toyota, which is attempting to take over Weisman's Mid-Atlantic Toyota

Japanese Trimming Work Week: More Japanese companies have switched to a 
five-day work week as the country moves to erase its workaholic image, a Labor 
Ministry survey found. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide survey of 5,000 companies with more than 3,000 employees showed 
that 58.4% have switched to a five-day week, more than five percentage points 
higher than a year ago. The number of workers benefiting from the shorter work 
week increased 2.8 percentage points in the same period to 82.7%. According to 
the survey, an average Japanese worker spends 41 hours 12 minutes a week at his 
or her office, 16 minutes less than in 1989.

Color of Money: Color copying machines are the fastest-growing segment of the 
office copier market. By 1994, the number of color copiers installed nationwide 
is expected to grow to 178,000, compared to 16,000 at the end of last year. 
Companies that stand to benefit include Mead Corp., the paper-products 
manufacturer in Dayton, Ohio, and Colorocs Corp. of Georgia, which makes color 
copiers for engineering documents, real estate portfolios and advertising 
brochures. High costs remain a hindrance to the market's growth, but industry 
insiders are confident that the market will grow as companies become more 
reliant on graphics to present their best side. Cleveland Plain Dealer

Golden Screens: Despite a 10% increase in gross box office receipts -- $5 
billion last year, compared to $4.5 billion in 1988 -- competition among 
theaters is growing as the number of screens continues to soar. The United 
States alone has 23,132 first-run screens, up from 17,600 in 1980. What are 
theaters doing to make themselves stand out? Some are attracting families by 
offering morning movies in the summer and bargain rates before 6 p.m. Others 
are trying special promotions with local radio stations, sneak previews and 
special discounts to senior citizens and students. Special events, such as 
group rentals, also bring in good concession returns. Business First of Greater

The bank chose the new name to avoid confusion with Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan,

FUNDAMERICA LEGIONS CHEER NEW CHIEF RUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of FundAmerica members poured into a Costa Mesa hotel Tuesday night 
for what author and forecaster Howard Ruff called the "rebirth and the 
resurrection" of the Irvine-based firm, which securities regulators raided two 
weeks ago, calling it a pyramid scheme. 
</P>
<P>
In his nearly two-hour presentation, Ruff, who replaced Robert T. Edwards as 
president and CEO on Monday, said he had not ruled out taking the company into 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, though he felt confident that 
he could restore the firm and had plans to actually take it public in the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had decided to take over the company because "I had an obligation to 
protect my friends." Some 1,500 subscribers to Ruff's financial newsletter have 
joined FundAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was enthusiastic about Ruff's speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very positive," said Mark Guest, a 25-year-old FundAmerica member from 
Monarch Beach who said he has made a six-figure income with the company. "He 
(Ruff) has the vision of the power and the marketing and the membership of this 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Ruff was greeted with a standing ovation and whistles. His circus-barker-type 
presentation was transmitted via telephone lines to 15,000 FundAmerica members 
in eight states. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff told members that they were not permitted to talk to the media under any 
circumstances or they would lose their membership. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who founded the company in 1986, was arrested July 19 by Florida 
authorities on charges that he was running an illegal pyramid scheme. If he is 
convicted, he could receive more than 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Released on $1-million bond, Edwards has disputed the charges. He did not 
attend Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff is best known for his gloom and doom predictions of the 1970s. He wrote 
the 1978 bestseller "How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years," as well as 
"Famine and Survival in America." 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica is under investigation in at least three of the eight states where 
it does business. 
</P>
<P>
Florida officials charge that the company has no real product and exists solely 
as a pyramid scheme, using membership dues from new investors to pay bonuses to 
existing ones. The company has vehemently denied the charge, saying its 
principal business is obtaining cash rebates for its members. Because it has so 
many members -- about 100,000 -- the company says it can get major discounts by 
buying in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
But regulators say the rebate system is rigged because FundAmerica uses money 
from new investors to subsidize rebates offered by companies such as Citibank. 
Once the company failed to attract new investors, it would have collapsed, 
regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica's presentation Tuesday was similar to the revivalist-style 
get-togethers that the company has held at the Red Lion Inn twice a week for 
the last several years. Those meetings were effervescent, complete with glowing 
testimonials about how much money people had made recruiting new members. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a federal judge in San Francisco modified a total freeze on 
FundAmerica's assets, which was put into effect after a class-action suit was 
filed against the company. The suit seeks more than $150 million in damages on 
behalf of its 100,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Patel decided Tuesday that FundAmerica could 
spend more than $1 million of $17 million in several bank accounts so it could 
meet payroll and severance obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the people who work for FundAmerica deserve to get their back pay, 
obviously, but they may want to reconsider their employment, given the fact 
that the company's former president is under criminal prosecution for running 
the company," said Daniel C. Girard, one of the attorneys filing the 
class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of FundAmerica's employees were threatening to walk off the job Tuesday 
unless they were paid. 
</P>
<P>
Patel rejected a request by the company to pay some $5 million in commissions 
to its sales representatives. She did say, however, that it could pay each 
representative up to $3,000 in commissions. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica charges $140 for a basic membership but pays bonuses to members who 
recruit new people. Bringing in new blood is the principal way that people 
achieved overnight success through the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We opposed the $5-million request on the grounds most of that money was going 
to go to a small group of participants, because it's a pyramid scheme -- people 
like Edwards in particular," Girard said.

MIKE GLICKMAN'S NO. 1 CREDITOR: HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The bankrupt Mike Glickman Realty Inc. owes money for everything from valet 
parking to tropical fish to taxes. But of 157 creditors, Mike Glickman himself 
is the biggest, with $1.9 million owed to him by the failed real estate 
brokerage he founded and headed. 
</P>
<P>
According to papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles late Friday 
in connection with Glickman Realty's liquidation proceedings, the Los Angeles 
Times is Glickman Realty's second-largest creditor, with $137,103 owed for 
advertisements. The Daily News is owed $26,498. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman &amp; Glickman, a law firm run by Mike Glickman's father and brother, 
is also a big creditor, with $43,876 in debts. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman's highly criticized extravagance is also apparent in the filing. Among 
other company debts, $18,558 is owed to Bernard Valet Service, which provided 
valet parking at some of Glickman's offices. The Parties to Go catering service 
is owed $11,051, and several thousand dollars in florists' bills also are 
listed. 
</P>
<P>
The only secured creditor is Imperial Bank, with $500,000 in debts. 
</P>
<P>
The papers list total debts of $3.9 million and total assets of $2.8 million, 
including $1.76 million in unpaid commissions owed to the company. However, the 
debt total doesn't include claims that may be made by homeowners who listed 
their homes with Glickman or claims that may arise from dozens of lawsuits 
pending against the company. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Glickman, 30, founded Glickman Realty in 1983 and quickly rose to dominate 
San Fernando Valley housing sales. However, critics blame Glickman's poor 
management skills and overzealous expansion for the company's troubles, which 
culminated in Glickman's personal and corporate bankruptcy filings June 5. 
</P>
<P>
The papers filed with the bankruptcy court last Friday don't itemize Glickman's 
personal assets and liabilities. That information is expected to be filed with 
the bankruptcy court today. 
</P>
<P>
Among other large corporate creditors are Custom Treatment Inc., which laid the 
carpeting in two of Glickman's offices; Grabiner Hall, a graphic design company 
that furnished Glickman Realty with its well-known logo, and a company owned by 
the former chief operating officer and in-house counsel for Glickman Realty. 
Several thousand dollars is also owed to various sign companies. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman Realty also owes $125,199 in unpaid workers' compensation insurance 
premiums to the California State Compensation Insurance Fund, and more than 
$5,750 in federal and state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The filing also says the company had $728 in cash on hand at the time of the 
bankruptcy filing, not including $75,000 in uncashed checks. That would be 
enough to cover the company's $345 bill for tropical fish.

PHONE COMPANIES' CABLE PLANS PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Senate committee Tuesday effectively dashed any hopes that telephone 
companies had of gaining entry into the cable television business this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee sent a compromise bill to 
the Senate floor that allows phone companies to build cable systems and run 
them as common carriers but bars them from owning any of the programming. The 
compromise, which largely maintains the status quo, replaced a more expansive 
phone company entry provision. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the controversial provision is expected to all but guarantee that 
the Senate will pass legislation to reregulate cable TV this year. Similar 
legislation is pending in the House. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, engineered by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), did not 
completely dismiss the argument that phone companies need to have some 
involvement in television to help them build modern fiber-optic networks that 
can carry voice, data and video over one wire. Many believe that the technology 
will be crucial in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The bill grants phone companies the right to build plants capable of handling 
both voice and video communications without obtaining a local government cable 
franchise. Yet it leaves intact the current restrictions forbidding phone 
companies from owning the content that runs over their lines. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, including cable operators, broadcasters and newspaper publishers, 
argue that if the phone companies were allowed to own the programs as well as 
the cable lines, they would have an unfair competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also asks the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a one-year 
study of expanding the phone companies' role in television. 
</P>
<P>
"We would rather that phone companies, like anyone else, have to obtain 
franchises in order to build video transmission, but overall this (bill) would 
leave the phone companies in no better position as video providers than they 
are today," said James P. Mooney, president of the Cable Television Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Broadcasters also hailed the bill as a victory. The phone 
companies have vowed that they will press the issue of entry into cable next 
year.

PLAN TO CUT VEHICLE USE MOVES AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE COUNTY DECIDES TO SUBMIT AN EMPLOYEE RIDE-REDUCTION PLAN 
INCLUDING CAR POOLS AND DISCOUNT TRANSIT TICKETS TO THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL 
DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday decided to submit a plan to 
reduce its employees' use of cars to the Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
By launching the county plan, board members overrode a staff recommendation to 
delay filing the plan with the district for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be submitted today, is designed to fight air pollution by reducing 
the number of cars driven to work by the county's more than 6,000 employees. 
The district is expected to take two months to review the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The plan includes guaranteed rides home in case of emergency for those who 
commute by bus or car pool, discounted transit tickets, subsidized van pools 
and preferential parking for car-pool members. 
</P>
<P>
Some county agencies already are taking part in early stages of the program, 
such as a "9-80" compressed schedule that allows employees to work 80 hours 
over nine days every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing to turn down Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg's 
request for the postponement, the supervisors at least partially reversed their 
July 17 position to give businesses with 100 or more employees another three 
months to develop trip-reduction strategies. 
</P>
<P>
That delay, the second for private industry this year, was sought by APCD 
Manager Richard H. Baldwin on the grounds that his office needed more time to 
inform business executives of their responsibilities under the district's Rule 
210. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, large businesses were scheduled to begin taking part in the program 
Jan. 1. That date was first set back to Aug. 1, then to Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Rule 210, adopted to bring the county into compliance with state and federal 
clean-air laws, sets a first-year goal of 1.35 employees per car for vehicles 
arriving at work between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. By 1997, the goal is to be raised 
to 1.5 employees per car. 
</P>
<P>
"These will be difficult goals to achieve," Air Pollution Control District 
Planning Manager William Mount said. "According to a California Department of 
Transportation study, average ridership in the county is about 1.12 or 1.14 
persons per car. It won't be easy to reach the higher standards." 
</P>
<P>
In answer to Wittenberg's warning that county department heads, as well as 
officials at private firms, need more time to finalize plans, Supervisor James 
R. Dougherty asked: "Why not adopt it today? You're going to have problems 
today or any other time you get started." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, who along with fellow Supervisor Maggie H. Erickson 
was named to a committee to oversee the county's ride-reduction efforts, said 
the program should be launched immediately so it could serve as a model to 
other employers. 
</P>
<P>
Board members voted 4 to 0 to launch the plan, with Chairwoman Madge L. 
Schaefer voting yes despite reservations about the first year's cost of at 
least $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
The district will review the county's strategies at seven work sites in 
Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
At the largest of these, County Government Center in Ventura, only 20 of the 
2,398 employees now get to work by bus and only 167 by car pool, according to a 
county survey. 
</P>
<P>
The trip-reduction plan calls for bus riders to increase to 48 and car poolers 
to 337. It also calls for more people to walk, ride bicycles or join partially 
subsidized van pools. 
</P>
<P>
County government is the second-largest employer in the county. It ranks behind 
the Navy's Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, where 9,700 civilians and 
military personnel are on the payroll.

RECYCLING CENTER TO TAKE IN MUCH GREATER VOLUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura's recycling center will greatly expand operations today, two days after 
the Ventura City Council approved agreements with a recycling company and the 
city's two rubbish haulers. 
</P>
<P>
The city-sponsored Gold Coast Recycling Center has been receiving between 20 
and 25 tons per day from single-family residences since mid-June. Today, the 
center will begin receiving an estimated 100 tons a day from businesses, 
recycling coordinator Eric Werbalowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the center received permits from the California Integrated Waste 
Management Board, allowing it to receive commercial loads. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Terry Adelman, who oversees the city's recycling program, said 
the state permits were necessary because up to 30% of commercial loads consist 
of non-recyclable waste mixed with the recyclable materials. The permit allows 
the city to handle the non-recyclable solid waste left over. 
</P>
<P>
More than 98% of residential loads can be recycled and no state license is 
needed for that program. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments, condominiums and mobile homes will be added to the recycling 
program in two to three weeks, Werbalowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling program cleared its final hurdle Monday when the City Council 
licensed the city's two rubbish companies to continue trash-hauling operations 
and begin collecting commercial recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to approve six-month contracts with E.J. Harrison 
&amp; Sons Inc. and Ventura Rubbish Service. The city normally hands out 
one-year permits, but this year shorter-term agreements were granted on the 
expectation of working out a five- to 10-year franchise contract with the 
rubbish companies. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said a franchise agreement would make it easier to map out a 
city strategy for solid waste in the next decade. The city is under a state 
mandate to reduce solid waste by 25% before 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Both rubbish companies are owned by the Harrison family, which has been 
involved in the city's trash business for more than 30 years. The Gold Coast 
Recycling Center is also partly owned by members of the Harrison family and its 
president is Jim Harrison, the son of E.J. Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing before the vote, about a dozen business owners praised the 
Harrison companies for their services and asked the council to renew their 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone was happy with the council's decision. Morteza Yassani, 
president of Rubbish Control Inc., said the council was denying him the chance 
to compete with the Harrisons. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my perception that the council is not for the best interest of the 
consumer but for the best interest of the city hauler," he said. Rubbish 
Control has tried unsuccessfully for years to operate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Yassani submitted the results of two surveys of businesses 
affiliated with the Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce showing that about 80% 
of the respondents would like the Harrison companies to have a competitor. He 
submitted letters from 13 businesses asking for competition. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials and Jim Harrison countered that trash hauling should be 
regarded as a utility instead of a competitive business. 
</P>
<P>
More rubbish companies would add to the city's traffic congestion and cause the 
city to lose control over its long-term trash-hauling and recycling policies, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now more than ever, rubbish collection should be regarded as a partnership 
between the city and its franchise company," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John S. Baker added that Rubbish Control had not proven that the 
city needs another garbage hauler. He said the city would evaluate the survey 
results submitted at Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
City officials did not rule out that Rubbish Control or another trash company 
could be included in the franchise agreement now in the works. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to set aside a $500,000 recycling fund to help pay for 
start-up costs until the program becomes profitable, which would require a 
volume of between 125 and 250 tons per day -- depending on fluctuations in the 
volatile market for recyclable materials. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura officials are counting on the participation of neighboring cities to 
meet its daily tonnage quota. So far, Oxnard and Camarillo have expressed 
interest in using the Gold Coast Recycling Center, but no agreement has been 
reached.

THOUSAND OAKS ACTS TO PROTECT EQUESTRIAN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to preserve one of the last equestrian centers remaining in the 
Thousand Oaks area, the City Council on Tuesday told a developer to find a new 
way to widen the access road to his project. 
</P>
<P>
David H. Murdock, developer of the 1,900-acre Sherwood Country Club luxury 
housing community, needs to rebuild and widen Potrero Road, an access route to 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
He had asked the city to let him put a drainage ditch through a corner of the 
Foxfield Riding School. 
</P>
<P>
But more than 200 people, lamenting the gradual disappearance of places to ride 
around Thousand Oaks, appeared in support of the equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
"Every place that was a riding academy is now a shopping center," said Mike 
Higgins, a 25-year Newbury Park resident, before the meeting. "Everything is 
getting squeezed out and stuccoed over." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Cohen told the council that the equestrian center "is not a club for the 
few idle rich. This is a place for people. Keep it for them. Let them have it." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for county approval of the Sherwood development -- where homes 
reportedly will cost from $1 million to $2 million -- Murdock agreed a few 
years ago to widen Potrero from two to four lanes, said John Clement, public 
works director in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
But to do the widening, engineers must deal with two drainage channels that run 
beneath the road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock planned to build a bridge over one of the channels and wanted to divert 
the other channel through Foxfield property, Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan had been approved, the city would have had to acquire the property 
through eminent domain, Clement said, with the developer footing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Foxfield manager Bill Postel wanted Murdock to build a bridge over both 
channels -- a more expensive proposition but one that would not disrupt as much 
Foxfield land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the council's unanimous vote in support of the center, the president of 
Murdock Residential Development, Donald Trotter, said the company would work 
toward an agreement with Postel. 
</P>
<P>
The Murdock plan would have cut off the corner of one of two 2,000-square-foot 
lighted arenas, disrupted a half-mile exercise track and encroached on other 
training areas, Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-acre riding school has little room for expansion, Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
The rural area sits in a canyon bordered by land owned by the Conejo Open Space 
Conservation Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which is open every day but Christmas from 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., is 
used by about 1,000 people a week, said Jo Ann Postel, who started the school 
with her husband in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 horses are boarded there. 
</P>
<P>
The Postels keep another 90 horses for English-style riding lessons and 
instruction in hunter and jumper riding, Bill Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which offers a summer camp for 210 children between 12 and 15, is 
well-known nationwide, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic competitors Hilda Gurney and Mark Watring took lessons as children at 
Foxfield. 
</P>
<P>
Watring now works as a trainer there, Jo Ann Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast screening trials for the Olympic equestrian jumping team were 
held at Foxfield for five years. And the 16-member Foxfield Equestrian Drill 
Team, which rides without bridles or saddles, has performed twice at Madison 
Square Garden, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The wooded area also was the setting of the movie "The Adventures of Robin 
Hood," with Errol Flynn, and several John Wayne Westerns, Jo Ann Postel said.

CARLSBAD TO APPLY FOR LATINO LIBRARY AID GRANT, WITH 1 CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under pressure from Latinos, the Carlsbad City Council voted unanimously 
Tuesday night to make a last-minute application for a $157,000 federal grant to 
provide Spanish-speaking residents with special library service. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action appears to have mended fences after a city official's 
earlier refusal to put the grant application on the council agenda had angered 
some Latino activists. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 5-0 decision to apply for the grant by today's deadline includes a 
condition. The council, worried that the city will be stuck with paying for the 
library program after the first year, won't accept the grant until its 
potential fiscal impact is studied. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of Carlsbad's downtown barrio of 9,000 Latinos urged the council 
to give them a place to learn American laws, where to find tax information and 
how to seek a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
"We Hispanics are willing to obey all the rules of this country," said Luis 
Maldonado, who spoke through an interpreter. "But a lot of times we don't do it 
because we don't know the process." 
</P>
<P>
He said many Latinos "don't even know how to use a telephone directory." 
</P>
<P>
"Our knowledge is very limited, we need a trustworthy source of information," 
Maldonado said. "The place where we come from, there are not too many 
libraries." 
</P>
<P>
Clifford Lange, the city library director, told the council he has long been 
concerned with serving the city's Latino population. But he said a survey 
revealed that "the library is perceived as an Anglo institution largely 
irrelevant to Hispanic lives." 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's main library at the Civic Center is less than a mile from 
the barrio, Lange said, "the psychological difference between the library and 
the neighborhood is immense." 
</P>
<P>
As Lang envisions a temporary, "transitional" information and referral center 
to serve Latinos by, among other things, helping them get tax aid, find English 
classes and provide a children's library. 
</P>
<P>
It would have a bilingual staff consisting of a manager, an assistant and three 
part-time clerks. Lang believes a state grant will "lay the groundwork" leading 
to a permanent program funded by the library when the grant runs out. 
</P>
<P>
The grant became controversial last week when Assistant City Manager Frank 
Mannen, believing the grant's financial impact on the city wasn't fully known, 
didn't put the matter on the council agenda in time for the grant application 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Valencia-Cothran and other local activists called Mannen's decision a 
"slap" at the Latino community that showed how little regard City Hall has for 
Latino needs. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bud Lewis called a special meeting to consider the application, and 
council members, after asking a few questions, voted without comment. The 
action soothed injured feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia-Cothran thanked the council and said, "We see this as an opportunity 
for these young families in the barrio to participate in their children's 
education."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY PANEL GIVES TENTATIVE OK TO SHIPYARD 
LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee has tentatively approved a new lease with 
the largest commercial shipyard on Terminal Island, but not without harsh words 
for the Harbor Department's handling of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 10-year lease with Southwest Marine Inc. drew criticism from the 
council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee because the 
agreement has been in negotiations since 1986 and falls short of the 20-year 
lease sought by the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who chairs the committee, said she 
was particularly sensitive to Southwest Marine's position, because it is the 
last large shipyard in the harbor.

BINGO FUND-RAISERS LIMITED TO 1 A WEEK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Institute of Equestrian Therapy will be limited to one bingo game a week to 
raise funds, the Simi Valley City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, which offers therapeutic horseback riding for the physically 
and mentally handicapped, operated bingo games on Friday and Saturday nights at 
4241 Valley Fair. 
</P>
<P>
They will continue to hold games on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The bingo games are the only source of revenue for the $17,000 monthly 
operation, said Jacques Fouchaux, institute director. 
</P>
<P>
The city adopted an ordinance in February, 1989, to limit the number of bingo 
games held by charitable organizations so one would not gain a monopoly, 
Assistant City Manager Brian Gabler said. 
</P>
<P>
The law originally was to become effective in March, 1989, but the City Council 
delayed implementing it to allow the institute to find other funding sources. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed, although I have to accept the decision, but now our 
income is cut in half and expenses are still the same," Fouchaux said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the state subsidized much of the institute's operation, but now 
it gets no state funding. 
</P>
<P>
The group began bingo games six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gabler said the organization had ample time to find other funding sources.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEWER LINE BREAK SENDS SEWAGE INTO STORM 
DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A break in an aging sewer line beneath a Santa Monica street sent hundreds of 
thousands of gallons of raw sewage flowing down the Pico-Kenter storm drain 
toward Santa Monica Bay before the leak was fixed last month. 
</P>
<P>
The leak in a 15-inch sewer line at 20th Street and Colorado Avenue was 
discovered as city workers searched for the source of sewage contamination that 
showed up in tests taken in the storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica General Services Director Stan Scholl estimated that at its peak, 
120 to 150 gallons of sewage per minute flowed from the sewer line through a 
nearby collector pipe into the storm drain. "It appears that this has been 
leaking for at least four weeks," Scholl said. "During that time, there's been 
several hundred thousand gallons that has leaked into the storm drain."

2 PULL OUT OF RACE FOR CITY COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
Two candidates for the Oxnard City Council have withdrawn from the November 
race to support council candidate Eleanor Branthoover, the chairwoman of an 
Oxnard neighborhood group who announced her candidacy Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Tuesday, Paul K. Dolan and Scott Bollinger said they 
will withdraw and support Branthoover, who has announced her intentions to seek 
one of two council seats. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year council terms of Manuel Lopez and Ann Johs expire in November, as 
does the two-year mayoral term of Nao Takasugi. Johs has filed papers to seek 
reelection. Lopez and Takasugi have not announced their plans. 
</P>
<P>
Branthoover, who considers herself an advocate for controlled growth, has 
served three years on the steering committee of the Inter-Neighborhood Council, 
which oversees more than 30 neighborhood councils throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
A third-generation Oxnard resident, Branthoover has accused the council of 
violating the state open meetings law several times. 
</P>
<P>
She said in an interview that if elected she would work for more public access 
to the council's decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan and Bollinger said Tuesday that they will withdraw from the race because 
they believe that Branthoover has a better chance of unseating an incumbent if 
fewer candidates divide the vote. HUGO MARTIN

FAMILIES OFFER HOPE TO ADDICTED PARENTS

<P>
Six-year-old Alfred learned to ride a skateboard in the first week he spent 
with Greg and Valerie Hoffman, foster parents for Hope for Kids Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really good at it," Hoffman said, beaming. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred and his sisters, Alondra, 12, and Cassondra, 7, are staying with the 
Hoffmans for four weeks while their mother, Carol, is treated at Latina House 
in Oxnard, a center for women addicted to alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The three children have found a haven with the Hoffmans and their two children, 
Tyler, 11, and Genevieve, 8. 
</P>
<P>
Without a foster family such as the Hoffmans, Carol said, she could not have 
re-entered a treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the program I have peace of mind because I know my kids are in a safe 
place," the 31-year-old Oxnard mother said. 
</P>
<P>
The only temporary foster program in Ventura or Santa Barbara counties, Hope 
for Kids allows parents to voluntarily place children with other families while 
the parent receives treatment for drug or alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
'We're sort of last resort when all other resources have failed, when there is 
no grandma, aunts or uncles to care for the children," said Diana Vogelbaum, a 
teacher at Thacher School in Ojai, who runs the program from her Oak View home. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Martin, director of the Miracle House Inc. treatment centers in 
Ventura and Oxnard, helped start Hope for Kids three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Without such a program, she said, her clients would have to be declared unfit 
parents before their children would qualify for foster care through county 
Child Protective Services. 
</P>
<P>
"If the mother should relapse, she would stand the chance of losing permanent 
custody of the child," Martin said. "When informed of that option, moms simply 
refuse to go into treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Trenten, who licenses foster homes for the county, said the agency can 
put children into care only when they are in immediate danger. "This program 
provides a mechanism for those parents who recognize they need to change but 
are not being legally forced to." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit program, which has helped 30 children and 20 parents, received a 
boost this year when the County Board of Supervisors doubled its budget 
allocation to $54,000. Seven foster families are licensed in Ventura, Oxnard, 
Camarillo, Moorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, Trenten said. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Hoffman said she and her husband became foster parents to continue 
caring for two children whose mother, a nurse, entered a treatment program. 
"It's improved our marriage and been a blessing for our family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The things our kids have taken for granted are such a treat to the others," 
Greg Hoffman, a mechanical designer for the U.S. Navy, said. "It's nice to feel 
I'm making a difference." THIA BELL

DRIFTER IS SENTENCED TO DIE FOR KILLING GIRL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ROLAND COMTOIS FACES THE GAS CHAMBER FOR MURDER AND FOR ANOTHER ASSAULT. 
THE JUDGE SAID THE CRIMES ARE THE MOST BRUTAL HE'S SEEN.

<P>
A judge Tuesday sentenced a drifter to die in the gas chamber for murdering a 
14-year-old Chatsworth girl and sexually assaulting and then shooting her 
13-year-old friend after abducting them from a residential street in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen ordered Roland Norman Comtois, 
60, handed over to the warden of San Quentin, where he will be put to death 
unless the sentence is overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Comtois' sentence, like all death sentences in California, will be 
automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court. He may pursue further 
appeals in federal court if his efforts at the state level fail. 
</P>
<P>
Coen upheld a jury's recommendation on June 21 that Comtois be put to death for 
the Sept. 19, 1987, murder of Wendy Masuhara and the attempted murder and 
sexual assault of her best friend. 
</P>
<P>
Coen said the crimes were more brutal than any he had seen in 17 years as a 
prosecutor and judge. 
</P>
<P>
"In hearing these facts, this appears to be more atrocious, more violent and 
more heinous than any case I have argued as the trier of fact," Coen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the order of this court that you shall suffer the death penalty," Coen 
told Comtois, who showed no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Coen also based his ruling on Comtois' previous convictions for rape, attempted 
bank robbery and armed robbery. Comtois' criminal record dates back to 1941, 
when he was charged with petty theft and deemed incorrigible by juvenile 
authorities, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of the surviving victim said outside court Tuesday that she and her 
daughter were pleased with the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied," she said. "It has been a tremendous ordeal. It has been 
a nightmare for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any sympathy whatsoever" for Comtois, the woman said. "I do feel 
sorry for his family. I feel sorry for my daughter. I feel sorry for the 
Masuharas, and I feel sorry for myself." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Masuhara and her friend were walking in their Chatsworth neighborhood 
when Comtois' companion, Marsha Lynn Ramos, 36, allegedly lured them inside a 
camper by telling them that it had stalled and needed to be jump-started. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, Comtois held a gun to the girls, forced the younger one to orally 
copulate him and told Ramos to inject her with cocaine, according to testimony. 
He then drove them to remote Woolsey Canyon in Chatsworth, placed them in an 
abandoned station wagon and shot them from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Masuhara died instantly. The younger girl, now 16, survived because she held up 
her hand behind her neck and deflected the bullet. 
</P>
<P>
One of Comtois' two court-appointed attorneys, James D. Gregory, pleaded with 
Coen Tuesday for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of 
parole, the only other sentencing option besides death. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said Comtois suffers from numerous physical ailments, including 
angina and a hernia, and is "old and infirm beyond his . . . years." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe if he is executed, the killing will only go on in this case," 
Gregory said. "His life experiences are so rotten. I don't think the jury knows 
this man. This man has redeeming factors that are difficult to comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
But Coen disagreed, telling Comtois: "You have a record that goes back to 1941. 
Everybody has a business, sir. Your business is making victims." 
</P>
<P>
During Comtois' penalty hearing in June, family members testified that he had 
an unhappy childhood, much of which he spent in an orphanage after his mother 
died when he was 4. Theresa Webb, his sister, said her brother was beaten and 
locked in closets for wetting his bed at the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold S. Lynn said Gregory's characterization of Comtois as 
old and infirm belied the fact that the defendant ran from police and jumped a 
nine-foot wall before an officer shot him twice. 
</P>
<P>
The chase in the Elysian Park area came four days after the kidnapings when a 
man reported that he saw a camper matching the description of the vehicle in 
which the girls were abducted. 
</P>
<P>
Besides convicting Comtois of murder and attempted murder, a jury on June 6 
found him guilty of two counts of kidnaping, one count of attempted sodomy, one 
count of committing a lewd act on a child, one count of forcible oral 
copulation and a count of furnishing a controlled substance to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who also faces the death penalty if convicted, is expected to stand 
trial in September.

FAMILY IDENTIFIED IN FIERY FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A family of four taking its first trip in a motor home from a rural area of 
British Columbia to Disneyland was identified Tuesday as the victims of a fiery 
crash on a Burbank freeway that left the husband, his wife and stepdaughter 
dead and his stepson badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Bertsch, a milkman who lived in Killiney Beach, had recently inherited the 
35-foot camper after his father's death, said neighbors in the town of 300 
residents about 200 miles northeast of Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Bertsch, 45, his wife, Joanne, who was in her late 30s, and her children from 
an earlier marriage, Gavin Sweezie, 14, and Allison Sweezie, 10, set off 
Thursday in the motor home for Southern California, said neighbor Kim Redding. 
</P>
<P>
"They were so looking forward to this trip," Redding said tearfully. "The 
family had traveled often. But this was the first time in the motor home and 
the kids were so excited because they were going to Disneyland. They had never 
been there." 
</P>
<P>
But the trip ended in catastrophe Monday morning on the southbound Golden State 
Freeway when the motor home and a semi hauling 50,000 pounds of tomatoes 
collided and crashed into a concrete abutment at the Burbank Boulevard 
overpass. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck escaped with minor injuries but the motor home burst 
into flames. Rescuers were only able to pull Gavin from the fire. He was burned 
over 80% of his body and remained in serious condition Tuesday at Childrens 
Hospital of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Redding said Bertsch and his wife were married last summer. In addition to 
driving a milk truck on a route through the small towns around Okanagan Lake, 
Bertsch also was a dog breeder. Redding said the couple had recently bought a 
large parcel of land near the lake and planned to live on the site in the motor 
home while a house was being built. 
</P>
<P>
"This was to be their big trip to California before they settled down and 
started building," Redding said. "Doug inherited the motor home a couple months 
ago but didn't pick it up until last week. He went and got it and they left." 
</P>
<P>
The accident remained under investigation Tuesday by the California Highway 
Patrol. Authorities declined to released the names of the three victims who 
were killed because their identities had not been confirmed through medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
But officials confirmed that Bertsch was the registered owner of the motor home 
and that Gavin Sweezie had lost his mother, sister and stepfather in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Officer David Padgett said the CHP was still looking for a white pickup truck 
that might have triggered the accident with a dangerous lane change. A truck 
driver who witnessed the accident told investigators that the pickup cut in 
front of the motor home and struck its front side, knocking it into the truck 
that was hauling tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Padgett said a Honda Accord was also involved in the accident. The car's right 
side was damaged and a passenger slightly injured at some point when it 
collided with the motor home, but investigators are still attempting to 
reconstruct the accident and determine what part the Honda played. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Iacobo, a spokeswoman for Childrens Hospital, said Gavin Sweezie remained 
in the intensive care unit and would face weeks of care there. She said the 
boy's father flew to Los Angeles from Canada Monday night and has been 
constantly at his side. Hospital officials declined to allow the father to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Iacobo said numerous phone calls were received Tuesday at the hospital from as 
far as Canada from people who did not know Gavin but were inquiring about his 
condition.

RESIDENTS MAKE STAND AGAINST TRUCK TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Woodland Hills homeowners, sipping coffee and rubbing chilly morning goose 
bumps, revolted against thunderous truck noise early Tuesday by blocking 
passage of huge trucks that jar them awake most weekday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not supposed to be here until seven o'clock! Seven o'clock!" Wendy 
Brockman yelled at the driver of a construction truck that rumbled up Dardenne 
Street at 6:20 a.m. and screeched to a stop within inches of the protester. 
</P>
<P>
In a suburban street standoff, the trucker yanked the gearshift into reverse, 
then thundered toward Brockman again. The trim woman stood unwavering at her 
post. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid!" she yelled as gasping neighbors gathered on the quiet street. 
"He's coming up a grade and he knows his brakes work. I refuse to give in to 
it!" 
</P>
<P>
Again, the grille of the truck stopped inches from Brockman's face. The driver, 
who identified himself later only as Monte, said Brockman had no right to stop 
his heavy dump truck. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for these people to come up here and jump in front of my truck, I 
think they are infringing on my rights," he said, adding that his orders were 
to report at the work site by 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Brockman and 14 other protesters took to their neighborhood streets after 
notifying Watt Pacific Inc., the developer of 33 houses in Mulholland Heights, 
that a noise agreement the company made with the county was violated in 
February and again in the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The clause states that no deliveries or work should begin before 7 a.m., and 
vehicles should not enter the residential neighborhood off Mulholland Highway 
before that time. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Dee, vice president of Watt Pacific, said he was attempting to identify the 
trucker who used his truck to charge Brockman. The driver probably was 
independently dispatched through a subcontractor to haul dirt from the site, 
Dee said, but "every one of the subcontractors knows the rules." 
</P>
<P>
"This is totally unacceptable to us," Dee said of the trucker's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Dee said the company "made a deal with homeowners, which we are going to live 
up to" about early morning traffic noise. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess what has happened in the last week is that a few of the guys didn't 
get the word," Dee said. He added that he ordered a guard to be posted on 
Mulholland Highway to stop trucks from turning onto the residential hill, and 
that subcontractors would be fined if their workers violated the noise 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a year away from completion," Dee said. "We don't want a big old 
riot at this stage of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant project supervisor Rob Montgomery was stationed at the Mulholland 
Drive turnoff to the neighborhood by 6:15 a.m. Tuesday morning. But several 
trucks, including the one that Brockman turned back, took a different route up 
the hill, dodging him. 
</P>
<P>
As the second hand swept to 7 a.m., more than two dozen construction vehicles 
along Mulholland Highway revved up their engines and entered the subdivision as 
clusters of homeowners moved aside to make way for the noisy parade. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners said they don't like the trucks, but they especially resent 
waking up to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them out here at 5 in the morning," said resident Ruth Coudare, who 
complained that the construction trucks spew dust as they pass, and that one 
once pitted her new car with rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Other homeowners said that three years ago, during a previous project, 
construction vehicles often clanked and groaned up their hill at two, three, 
four o'clock in the morning, making deliveries and hauling earthmoving 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of murder when you're in your front bedroom," said homeowner Lillian 
Saroian, who also lives on Dardenne Street. 
</P>
<P>
The truckers were angry too. 
</P>
<P>
"We are supposed to be on the job at 7," fumed a truck driver who would 
identify himself only as Scott. "We've got families to feed too. How do they 
think their houses got built?" 
</P>
<P>
"Look at them," said carpenter Cliff Beattie, pointing at a line of cars 
emerging from the subdivision. "They're going to work. They're up! So what's 
the big deal?" 
</P>

COUNCIL POSTPONES DECISION ON STATUS OF FRYMAN CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to postpone for 60 days a decision 
on whether to declare rustic Fryman Canyon a cultural-historic landmark, with 
proponents saying the extra time is needed to forge a plan to buy the 63-acre 
site in Studio City for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
"We're buying time to complete the acquisition," said Councilman Michael Woo, 
who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
On a 10-4 vote, the council backed Woo's motion to delay until Oct. 2 further 
consideration of landmark status for Fryman Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Woo also said additional time is needed to determine if city officials erred in 
1986 in granting development approval to Fryman Canyon developer Fred Sahadi to 
build 26 luxury homes on the site, located in the hills above Studio City, 
before Sahadi had deeded half of the 63 acres to the state for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
If such an error were made, it would call into question the legality of a 
grading permit issued to Sahadi for the Fryman property, said Tim Taylor, 
assistant general manager of the city's Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency, 
voted to put up $8.7 million to help acquire Fryman Canyon, and urged the city 
of Los Angeles to appropriate any additional funds needed to complete sale of 
the land to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi has had the property appraised at $13.7 million, but state officials 
have estimated its value at $8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said Tuesday's council vote 
to delay provides a "quieting-down period while the city seeks money for 
acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston and the conservancy have proposed that the city's Department of Water 
and Power sell surplus land it owns in the Santa Monica Mountains to raise 
capital to buy Fryman. Selling two DWP parcels totaling less than 10 acres -- 
one in the Pacific Palisades, the other in Woodland Hills -- would raise $2 
million from developers, Edmiston has said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Waters, acting general manager of the DWP, said he and DWP Commission 
President Mike Gage have been asked by Mayor Tom Bradley to explore the 
proposal. A staff review is under way, Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
The "bottom line for us is to look at this from the ratepayer's standpoint," 
Waters said Tuesday. "Does it make sense to ratepayers? We can't just do 
something like this just because it might be a good thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
But Waters acknowledged that a legitimate question for the giant city-owned 
utility is whether it makes sense to retain ownership of properties that are 
now unused. 
</P>
<P>
Another consideration would be the reaction of adjoining property owners to the 
sale of the properties to developers, Waters said. "I don't want to get into 
more hot water" by selling parcels that people thought the city was "going to 
leave vacant forever," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
Gage said he was skeptical of Edmiston's land sale proposal. "There's a need 
for a lot more data before I could support it," Gage said. "I don't see how it 
benefits the DWP or ratepayers, and unless I see that I could not support it." 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision Tuesday to delay consideration of landmark status for 
the canyon appeared to be more a sign of support for Woo's efforts to purchase 
the site than support for declaring the canyon a cultural-historic monument. 
Such status would delay development of the property for at least one year. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Gloria Molina and Nate Holden, although voting with Woo for 
postponement, argued against landmark status, saying that declaring vacant land 
a monument would set an unusual precedent. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision was sharply criticized by Sahadi's attorney, Benjamin M. 
Reznik. Reznik said the delay is yet another attempt by the city to increase 
Sahadi's expenses in order to force him to accept a price for his land from the 
conservancy below its value. Quoting a U.S. Supreme Court justice's comment on 
a similar case, Reznik called the city's actions part of an "out-and-out plan 
of extortion." 
</P>
<P>
To finally develop his property, Sahadi still must secure approvals from the 
state Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Both 
agencies are looking at Fryman Canyon to determine if it is a unique habitat or 
a home to any plant or animal life in need of protection.

DRIVER ENTERS PLEA IN FATAL CRASH ON GRADUATION NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Justin Neff pleaded not guilty Tuesday to vehicular manslaughter in the 
drunk-driving accident that killed a former fellow Fillmore Senior High School 
student just five hours after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Neff, 20, of Garden Grove stood quietly in the jury box in Ventura County 
Municipal Court, dressed in prison uniform and leg irons, as his attorneys 
entered his plea in the June 15 accident that killed 18-year-old James Anderson 
of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
Neff, who graduated from Fillmore Senior High School in 1987, had driven from 
Garden Grove the morning of June 14 to attend graduation. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Anderson hitched a ride with Neff as they left a party, 
witnesses have said. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 a.m. Neff's Camaro veered off a winding road south of Fillmore and 
struck a power pole. The impact snapped the pole, crushed Anderson in the 
passenger seat and flung Neff from the vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have said beer cans were strewn around the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Neff's attorneys, Michael Norris and Richard Loy, made discovery 
requests for records and evidence, which included blood samples taken from Neff 
shortly after the accident, to be studied for alcohol content by an independent 
laboratory; and videotapes of Neff taken by a gas station surveillance camera 
shortly before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Norris also asked Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes to clarify the charges 
against Neff. Holmes explained that Neff is accused of gross vehicular 
manslaughter while intoxicated and drunk driving, the second of which included 
special allegations that Neff was speeding and failed to remain on the road. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Anderson's death, Neff was serving three years probation on a 
1988 drunk-driving conviction, and had pleaded guilty to another drunk-driving 
charge just two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
He remains in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail and faces up to 10 
years in prison if convicted of drunk driving and gross vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Aug. 27 in Municipal 
Court.

GORMAN MAN, 34, HELD ON SUSPICION OF ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Gorman-area man was being held on suspicion of arson Tuesday for setting a 
small grass fire on a neighbor's property after a dispute, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's arson investigators arrested Robert Jordan, 34, at 
his home Monday near 250th Street West and Avenue A in the sparsely populated 
northwest Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan allegedly used a cigarette lighter Saturday afternoon to set a fire that 
burned a quarter of an acre of grass on property containing a house and a feed 
store near 250th Street West and Avenue C-15, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which residents extinguished before firefighters arrived, bore little 
resemblance to a spate of suspicious brush fires this month in the Antelope and 
Santa Clarita valleys. Jordan is not a suspect in any other fires, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the house and feed store told firefighters that the fire was set 
by his neighbor after an argument, county Fire Capt. Michael Glosson said. 
Deputies acting on a tip later arrested Jordan, who was being held in lieu of 
$20,000 bail at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

Sugar Price Supports 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 150 to 271, the House rejected an amendment to lower from 18 cents 
to 16 cents per pound the level at which the government props up the price of 
domestic sugar. Although the program sets an artificially high price that works 
its way through to consumers, it operates at small cost to the Treasury. The 
vote occurred as the House debated a five-year extension of federal farm 
programs (HR 3950). 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Jim Moody (R-Wis.) said: "To vote against this amendment is to say, 
'Down with the consumers, up with the handful of producers that benefit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jerry Huckaby (D-La.) said the sugar program is a consumer program 
providing "stable supplies of sugar at a solid, reasonable, predictable price." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to lower federal price supports and thus the market price of 
sugar.

Farm Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 159 to 263, the House rejected a farm bill amendment to deny 
federal crop support payments to the nation's wealthiest farmers, those with 
adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or more. The amendment would have reduced 
spending for loans, direct payments and other subsidies by $700 million 
annually. About 20,000 individuals and 4,500 farm entities would have been 
denied payments under the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill Green (R-N.Y.) asked: "Is it such a harsh thing to ask that 
people who are above $100,000 a year in income come off the dole?" 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Neal Smith (D-Iowa) said the purpose of farm payments is not income 
maintenance but to stabilize supplies and prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to end taxpayer subsidies of the nation's wealthiest farmers.

Honey Program 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 178 for and 215 against, the House rejected an amendment to phase 
out the federal honey program over four years. This put the House treatment of 
honey in the new farm bill at odds with that of the Senate, which voted (below) 
to end the 51-year-old loan program that guarantees profits to about 2,000 
beekeepers regardless of market conditions. The program cost $385 million 
during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) called honey supports "the most ridiculous 
giveaway program to ever wriggle its way into the lawbooks." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Glenn English (D-Okla.) said the honey program "has provided great 
benefit to not only American agriculture but the American consumer." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to phase out the federal subsidy of beekeepers.

<P>
Geneva M. Brewster, who inspected airplane parts at Lockheed Corp. during World 
War II and later supervised the duplicating department, has died in Burbank. 
She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Brewster, who had lived in the same Burbank house since 1939, died Friday

<P>
Born Geneva Erwin on May 27, 1905, in Clinton, Ky., she came to California as a 
child. She graduated from Huntington Park High School and in 1942 went to work 
for Lockheed in Burbank. She was an assembly line worker and later inspected 
airplane rivets that were manufactured at the plant. After World War II ended, 
she supervised the duplicating department, making blueprints and copies of 
reports and memos. She retired in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Brewster was also active in the Burbank chapter of Church Women United and 
the Christian Women's Fellowship at the Little White Chapel Christian Church in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her husband of 63 years, Kenneth Brewster of Burbank; a son, 
Richard Brewster of Burbank; a daughter, Barbara Hoeke of Albuquerque, N.M.; a 
brother, Howard Erwin of Vancouver, Wash.; a sister, Ruth Chandler of 
Corvallis, Ore.; four grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at the Little White Chapel Christian 
Church. Burial will follow at Glen Haven Memorial Park, which is handling the 
arrangements. Donations can be made to the Geneva Brewster Memorial Fund, in 
care of the Little White Chapel Church, 1711 N. Avon St., Burbank, 91505.

FAMILY SETTLES WRONGFUL-DEATH SUIT OVER SON SHOT BY GEORGIA DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNA M. DE LA CRUZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An out-of-court settlement has been reached in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed 
on behalf of the family of a Mira Mesa man who was shot to death by an 
auxiliary sheriff's deputy on a Georgia freeway. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Anthony A. Alaimo of Brunswick, Ga., blocked release of 
the details of the settlement, which was reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed last October in U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Georgia and sought $12 million in damages for the death of Mark 
Charles Nanz, 29. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just glad that the civil courts were able to do what the local courts 
were unable to do, and that is impose punishment on the people involved," 
Nanz's father, Chuck Nanz of Chula Vista, said Tuesday. "We're hoping that the 
federal Justice Department will pursue the charges against the parties 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Nanz was shot and killed in April, 1989, when the trucker with whom he had 
hitched a ride led police on a four-county chase along Interstate 95 in 
southeast Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad it's over," said Nanz's mother, Leah M. Archibeque of Mira Mesa, 
who declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-mile chase began in Glynn County just before dusk and ended in Bryan 
County when an uncertified Liberty County auxiliary deputy fired several shots 
into the cab of the truck, injuring the driver, Klaus Kirk of Denver, and 
fatally wounding Nanz. 
</P>
<P>
The Nanz family alleged that, when the truck finally stopped, Kirk and Nanz 
were dragged from the cab and beaten by a McIntosh County deputy and a Liberty 
County deputy. The suit contended that Liberty County was negligent in allowing 
uncertified auxiliary deputies to carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty County Deputy Johnny Ryals and McIntosh County Deputy Charles Wallace 
were found guilty of beating Kirk and Nanz last year. Both deputies were given 
brief jail sentences, community service work and fines. 
</P>
<P>
The family was not satisfied with that punishment, according to Chuck Nanz. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty County Sheriff R. V. Sikes and Detective John Dasher also were named 
individually as defendants because "they're supposed to be responsible for 
their people" and what they do, said attorney Charles Ashman, who represented 
Nanz's family. 
</P>
<P>
Glynn and McIntosh counties were included in the suit because they failed to 
properly control the chase in their jurisdictions, Ashman said, adding that 
Bryan County was accused of "a failure to respond appropriately" to a medical 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy that some justice is being administered insofar as the way Mark 
was killed," Chuck Nanz said.

As Tuesday dawned, Bobby Beathard, the new general manager, had to be astounded 
that nine players were missing because of contractual disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
Nine players? 
</P>
<P>
This team must be coming off a pretty big year to cause such a large group of 
athletes to think their services are that much more valuable than what 
management was offering. 
</P>
<P>
Right? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it wasn't a Super Bowl team, but surely it made it to the AFC 
championship game . . . or at least the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
No? 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Chargers were 6-10 and finished last in their division? This franchise 
hasn't had a whiff of the playoffs since Ronald Reagan had his memory . . . or 
Roseanne Barr weighed less than an H-back? 
</P>
<P>
Did these guys actually believe the highlight film? Didn't any of them notice 
it was only six minutes long? 
</P>
<P>
Didn't any of these guys realize that 1989 season ticket sales were more than 
18,000 below 1984's high, and that attendance ran more than 13,000 below 
capacity? 
</P>
<P>
This surely was a franchise far below par in terms of artistic and financial 
success. Trying to squeeze this franchise for extra bucks has to be a little 
like a union striking the S&amp;L industry. 
</P>
<P>
And yet there were those nine empty beds in UCSD's dormitories and nine empty 
uniforms in the locker room. Beathard, the architect of four Super Bowl 
champions, had to be perplexed that so many players were missing from so 
pedestrian a club. 
</P>
<P>
Gill Byrd, the veteran of the bunch and perhaps the wisest, signed his contract 
later Tuesday and checked in to both his suite and uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Another holdout, Cedric Figaro, was expected today. 
</P>
<P>
So then there would be seven. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining seven, four were not exactly operating with safety nets. 
Defensive backs Sam Seale and Vencie Glenn and offensive linemen Broderick 
Thompson and David Richards all occupy areas feared to be weak, which obviously 
makes them vulnerable to takeovers by enthusiastic children or wily Plan 
B-style veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Their bargaining power is such that they should not consider backing Beathard 
into a corner, lest he trigger trap doors at their feet. 
</P>
<P>
The other three, however, are totally different and yet totally intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them, Leslie O'Neal and Lee Williams, were stalwarts in the one area in 
which the Chargers already are populated by Super Bowl-caliber players . . . 
the defensive front seven. The defense was No. 6 in the National Football 
League in 1989, and these guys were the heart of it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if the offense had merely been average (or slightly below), the 1989 
Chargers would have been in the playoffs, could have made the AFC championship 
game and might actually have stumbled into the Super Bowl. If the Chargers had 
scored a mere 21 points in each of those 10 losses, the regular-season record 
would have been 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't. The offense stunk. 
</P>
<P>
So O'Neal and Williams have leverage, though their circumstances are different. 
Whereas O'Neal is not under contract, Williams is scheduled to labor for 
$725,000, plus a possible $100,000 in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
It might have seemed Williams is being adequately remunerated, even given 
back-to-back Pro Bowl starts, except . . . 
</P>
<P>
Williams picks up the newspaper and sees that the Chargers and Junior Seau, 
their No. 1 pick in the college draft, are said to be $900,000 a year apart in 
their contractual conversations. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was already in camp, but this gets his attention. O'Neal, though 
unsigned and therefore not in camp, undoubtedly was already keeping a watchful 
eye on what an untried kid might command. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Junior Seau, who has never played a down in the NFL, is the key to 
financial comfort for the two key players in the one area in which the Chargers 
figured they didn't have a worry in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Seau, you understand, was drafted immediately after Keith McCants, whom Tampa 
Bay reportedly signed for five years at $1.2 million per. Not surprisingly, 
Seau's agent suggests his client get at least what McCants got. 
</P>
<P>
What we're talking here is a dominoes . . . solid gold dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
You think Leslie O'Neal will sign for less than Seau? 
</P>
<P>
Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, there is no way O'Neal will sign before Seau. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Lee Williams and his demand for renegotiation. That's a dirty 
word. No one does it . . . or admits they do. 
</P>
<P>
This little dilemma represents Bobby Beathard's first big test as Charger 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
If he makes Junior Seau happy, he has to make the unsigned O'Neal happier. And 
then he must find a way to salve the ego . . . read that bank account . . . of 
Lee Williams.

CHARGERS TRY TO GET 2 IN LINE

<P>
The Chargers have turned tough with two of their holdout players, telling 
starting offensive linemen David Richards and Broderick Thompson the team will 
reduce its contract offers if they do not report by today. 
</P>
<P>
The players were informed of the team's intent by letter, General Manager Bobby 
Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone as far as we can go with Richards and Broderick," Beathard said 
Tuesday. "We're at the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said Friday the team had made its final offers to the two players and 
linebacker Cedric Figaro. Figaro was expected to sign and report to training at 
UC San Diego today, Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
The agent for Thompson, Jeff Irwin of Scottsdale, Ariz., said Beathard wrote 
Thompson he will reduce the offer by $5,000 if Thompson does not report by 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin, who plans to speak with Beathard today, said he still considers the 
team's one-year contract proposal unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't make any difference at all," Irwin said of Beathard's approach. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the letter warned of further reductions if the players let 
today's deadline pass. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the threat came on the same day the Chargers announced they signed 
their first player in four days -- reducing to seven the number of unsigned 
players. Cornerback Gill Byrd reported to the afternoon practice after signing 
a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is valued at $2.2 million, including bonuses, a source said. That 
is a considerable raise from the $360,000 base salary Byrd reportedly made last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm comfortable," Byrd said. "This wasn't about looking around the league to 
see who got paid what. I knew what I wanted for my wife and my two children, 
what would make Gill Byrd and his family happy and satisfied. That is all that 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
The signing had been expected by Beathard since Saturday morning, but Byrd did 
not sign until Monday night. Byrd said the wait had nothing to do with further 
negotiations; he simply wanted to delay the rigors of camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the deal done," Byrd said. "It wasn't a matter of money at all. I 
really honestly was trying to stretch it out. They might be mad at me for 
saying that. But now I'm wishing I should have been here Saturday. I really 
need the work. I'm glad I didn't stretch it out any further." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd is coming off what might have been his best season in seven years in the 
league. He led NFL cornerbacks with seven interceptions, and his 14 
interceptions over the past two seasons rank first at his position. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Byrd, the Chargers still are without half of their starting 
secondary. Free safety Vencie Glenn and cornerback Sam Seale remain unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd said he felt a little strange on the field without two of his veteran 
teammates, but he did have a reminder with him. At practice, he wore two white 
towels from his belt. On one he wrote in black ink Glenn's number "25" and on 
the other Seale's number "30." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't forget them," Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard reported no significant progress in contract talks with Glenn and 
Seale or the team's two other unsigned players, linebackers Leslie O'Neal and 
Junior Seau, the Chargers' first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Lee Williams also is missing from camp. He walked out Saturday 
because the club said it will not renegotiate his contract. 
</P>
<P>
If Williams does not return to camp by Thursday, the team has notified him it 
will consider imposing daily fines and has the option of placing him on the the 
reserve/left camp list, which would make ineligible to play or be paid this 
season by any NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the team has not made a decision about what it might do if 
Williams does not report back by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Feldman, the Newport Beach-based agent who represents Williams, said 
Williams has returned to his home in Florida and has no intention of returning 
at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee is staying right where he is," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is upset, Feldman said, because Beathard will not honor what he said 
was an oral agreement by Beathard's predecessor, Steve Ortmayer, to renegotiate 
Williams' contract. Beathard has said he has found no evidence of such an 
agreement and that he is not bound by any oral promises Ortmayer made. 
</P>
<P>
Contract squabbles have become a part of training camp life, but Coach Dan 
Henning is trying to keep his good humor about it. 
</P>
<P>
Asked this week about the team's latest troubles with Williams, Henning wryly 
replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a player who has ever come back and said, 'I didn't have a good 
year last year and need to give (money) back.' Now when I was (coaching) in 
Atlanta one year, I mentioned that on a radio show and somebody called in to 
say, 'Did you offer to give anything back after the year you had last year?' I 
said, 'No, but I'm not holding out.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers leave Thursday morning for three days of practice with the Phoenix 
Cardinals at their training site in Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
But because of runway restrictions at the airport in Flagstaff, the team is 
using one plane to fly in and two to fly out. The Charger party is safe to land 
in one plane, but too large to be allowed to take off. 
</P>
<P>
And in a request that must do little to ease nervous passengers, everyone who 
intends to be on the plane is being asked to provide his or her weight. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had anybody ask me that in 20 years," Henning said. "It used to 
worry me puddle-jumping around going to different schools. But you have to 
understand, they're trying to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Ken Woodard said he has been cleared to practice after 
further tests revealed he did not have a heart ailment. Woodard was 
hospitialized early Friday morning after complaining of chest pains and 
shortness of breath. . . . Gill Byrd is not the only one keeping alive the 
memory of teammates missing from training camp. On Monday, one of the blocking 
sleds bore the No. 99 jersey of Lee Williams, the team's wayward defensive 
tackle, on Tuesday, it had been replaced by the No. 91 of Leslie O'Neal, the 
team's holdout veteran outside linebacker.

<P>
A whiff of mystery mingles with the aroma of chicken Florentine at the Imperial 
Restaurant in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
Will the private eye Rick, who likes to be known as Just Plain Rick, discover 
who killed the powerful tycoon Andrei Gauvreau? 
</P>
<P>
Will Just Plain Rick be distracted from his investigation of several shady 
characters by that sphinx of a minx, Sheila Wonderly? 
</P>
<P>
Will he be helped or hindered by the audience? Will dinner continue even if the 
actor who happens to be your waiter gets shot? 
</P>
<P>
And will novice producer Julia Holladay make a go of the latest branch of the 
Boston-based Murder Mystery Cafe here in San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
So far the answers are yes, yes, yes, yes and most emphatically yes. 
</P>
<P>
Holladay, former director and vice president of the Learning Annex, recently 
made back her investment after two months of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"First (in May), it sold out every night," reported Holladay on the phone from 
her office at the Imperial House. "Then, there was a lull in June. Then, I 
don't know what happened, but we've been selling out." 
</P>
<P>
What happened seems to be that San Diegans have discovered an appetite for 
murder mystery dinner theater -- a theatrical form that has never played this 
city on a weekly basis before. 
</P>
<P>
The waiters and waitresses double as the actors in "Murder at Cafe Noir." In 
between dishing out four courses, they dish up a farcically convoluted plot 
satirizing old detective films. Most of the action takes place in a performance 
area. 
</P>
<P>
One minute, the "waiters" are asking whether you want more coffee, the next, 
the same people, as actors, may be asking you whether they should burn a 
mysterious envelope without reading its contents. 
</P>
<P>
But, as charming as this fast and funny little satire is, the customers are not 
coming in for the play alone. 
</P>
<P>
That's no aspersion on the artful direction by Thomas Vegh and the colorful 
performances by John Rosen as Rick, Melissa Harte as the hot-to-trot Sheila 
Wonderly and Eileen Ivey as Madame Tourneau, the mysterious owner of Cafe Noir. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that, if this script were mounted on a stage without a 
dinner or audience interaction, it would not be playing this long. 
</P>
<P>
So do they come for the dinner, or for the opportunity to be teased by the 
actors who treat them as if they are customers in the bar that Rick frequents? 
Or to tell Rick whether he should burn or read the secret letter he finds, or 
to guess who the killer really is? 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons and more, they come. And they come back with friends. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the demand, Holladay, who had been offering two shows a week in 
her 120-seat house, said she will be offering three mystery dinners this month: 
one on Fridays at 8 p.m. and two on Saturdays, at 5 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
She is already examining new Mystery Cafe scripts she is thinking of 
introducing: 
</P>
<P>
* A Chris-Mystery script, also known as the Kris Kringle Capers, in December. 
</P>
<P>
* And "Last Chance in Death Valley," where the setting is a pump and grill in 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
David Goldstein, the president of the 2 1/2-year-old Murder Mystery Cafe, said 
on the phone from his Boston office that San Diego has proved to be his most 
successful market to date. That's compared to the nine other cities his company 
is playing in, including Chicago, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Washington, Dallas 
and Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein produced his first mystery at an 80-seat tavern in Cambridge, Mass. 
The show took off immediately, he said, and now he calculates that his company, 
which gets a royalty on each patron, brings in about 50,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
He has even been able to maintain simultaneous murder mystery theaters in 
Boston, Braintree and Cambridge, three cities relatively close to each other. 
</P>
<P>
But why the growing interest in interactive theaters? Goldstein will tell you 
simply that the shows are entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
They are that, but ask Goldstein's main scriptwriter, David Landau, the author 
of "Murder at Cafe Noir" the same question, and he will tell you that the 
growing interest in interactive mysteries -- an interest he shares with a 
passion -- is also a sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
Landau relates the growing popularity of the form to the increasing hunger 
people have for connection in an increasingly impersonal environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a very anti-social world," he said on the phone from his New York 
home, where he was working on his newest script. 
</P>
<P>
"People commute, they work on personal computers, they watch TV and VCRs -- 
where's the interaction? 
</P>
<P>
"Man is a herding animal. He's not meant to be isolated. . . . It's refreshing 
to have someone acknowledge you exist and make you feel part of a group 
experience. You're no longer a nameless, faceless watcher. The actor is talking 
to you."

WHEN RIO'S BAR WENT DRY, SO DID ITS WELL OF TALENT

When his liquor license was suspended two months ago, Cameron Moshtaghi, owner 
of Rio's nightclub in Loma Portal, cut back on the number of nights per week 
his club is open. Down from seven to as few as two or three. 
</P>
<P>
Since the June 7 suspension, the popular haven for local original-music bands 
-- and frequent site of concerts by national upstarts -- has been operating as 
an 18-and-up club, with no alcohol served. 
</P>
<P>
The dip in revenues, Moshtaghi said, has made it increasingly difficult to hire 
quality bands. Hence, the cutback. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we usually do it, the band gets the door and we keep the bar," 
Moshtaghi said. "Now there is no bar, so it's a pretty tough situation for 
original bands. They cannot make any money because we have to take most of the 
door money, just to cover our operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"And, without the benefit of liquor sales, we don't have many bands we can 
afford -- which is why we're only going to be open on a part-time basis, 
whenever we can get a good, affordable band." 
</P>
<P>
Moshtaghi's liquor license was suspended by the state Alcoholic Beverage 
Control Department because he doesn't serve food, required under his "Type 47" 
license. 
</P>
<P>
"They closed him down because he's supposed to be a bona fide public eating 
place and he's not," said Pete Case, district administrator of the ABC office 
in San Diego. "He went before an administrative law judge, and he threw the 
book at him, since this is the second time he's been up for the same charge." 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was for 40 days, "and an indefinite time thereafter until he 
either changes into a public eating place or gets a different type of license," 
Case said. 
</P>
<P>
Moshtaghi has already applied for a new "Type 48" license that doesn't require 
him to serve food, but his hopes for a quick transfer were dashed by protests 
from neighbors -- including the owner of another nightclub two doors down -- 
and police. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got a letter from the Sacramento (ABC) office, telling me they would 
let me know 'shortly' what the status is," Moshtaghi said. "They've got my 
application and all the protests, they're reviewing everything, and then 
they're either going to accept it, reject it, have a hearing, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, Rio's will continue to operate part time, as a teen club, 
with no alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
The Michelob Street Scene expands to two days this year, Sept. 7 and 8, and 
will feature performances by more than 40 pop acts on eight stages scattered 
throughout a 12-block area of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Rob Hagey said he's still negotiating with several big-name rock acts 
to headline the event, but most of the other bookings are already confirmed. 
Here is the almost-complete lineup for Michelob Street Scene '90 -- which, by 
the way, is the eighth in seven years: 
</P>

Richard, Pancho Sanchez, the Beat Farmers and Bulldozer (7th and L Street 
Stage). A main act will be announced later for the 91X Rock Stage, 3rd Avenue 
and K Street. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Sept. 8: Buckwheat Zydeco, C. J. Chenier and the Red Hot Louisiana 
Band, the Rebirth Brass Band (Cajun Stage, 5th and Island); Johnny Winter, Koko 
Taylor and Her Blues Machine, Five Blind Boys From Alabama and the Mighty

</P>
<P>

mariachi music both Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

Tickets go on sale Monday at 10 a.m. at all TicketMaster outlets. Cost is $15. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Buddy Blue's debut album for Rhino Records is all but complete, 
after a month of sessions at Hit Single Recording Services in the College Area. 
"All that's left to be done is a little (between-song) narration by Harvey 
Pekar," said Blue, formerly with local "blue-eyed" soul band the Jacks. Pekar 
is a comic-book author best known for a series of outrageous appearances on 
television's "Late Night With David Letterman." The album's cover art, Blue 
added, is being done by underground cartoonist Spain Rodriguez, part of the Zap 
Comix stable. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two veteran folkies will be joining the San Diego Symphony Aug. 14 for a 
special one-night-only "SummerPops EXTRA!" program at Hospitality Point on 
Mission Bay. They are Mason Williams, whose "Classical Gas" went all the way to 
No. 2 on the national pop charts in 1968, and John Hartford, whose "Gentle on 
My Mind" was a big hit for Glen Campbell that same year. Williams will be 
bringing along his own back-up band, featuring such respected bluegrass 
musicians as three-time national fiddle champion Byron Berline and mandolin 
player Jerry Mills, formerly with the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. for Tommy Page's Aug. 30 concert at the 
Civic Theatre. Sweet Sensation and Linear will open. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Al Green, tonight at Humphrey's on 
Shelter Island; the Ramones with Deborah Harry, Jerry Harrison and the Tom Tom 
Club, Saturday at San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre; Peter Murphy 
with the House of Love, Sunday at Symphony Hall downtown; and the Righteous 
Brothers, Monday at Humphrey's.

MYSTERY THEATERS ON THE WAY

<P>
The Murder Mystery Theatre -- a Los Angeles-based organization that has been in 
San Diego for one year -- will begin a weekly interactive murder mystery dinner 
series on Friday nights at the Horton Grand Hotel beginning Aug. 10. It plans 
to rotate scripts monthly. 
</P>
<P>
The group will continue what to now has been a monthly staging of murder 
mysteries on trains and cruises in San Diego, in which the patrons play a 
larger part in the action. The actors are trained to blend in with the guests. 
A patron doesn't know if the stranger he struck up a conversation with between 
the courses is another guest or a potential murder victim or suspect. The 
action has the effect of exploding around you. 
</P>
<P>
People may even look at you suspiciously, trying to gauge whether you are one 
of the planted actors. 
</P>
<P>
The shows will start with cocktails at 7 p.m. and continue through dinner for 
up to 110 patrons a night. 
</P>
<P>
Opening in September will be "The KPUG Talk Radio Murder Mystery" at the Town 
and Country Hotel in Mission Valley. The hotel is converting its Abilene saloon 
into a 170-seat theater for an open-ended run of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Written by San Diegans Bill McGaw, Hall Sprague and Garry Shirts, the show was 
a hit when it premiered at the Coronado Playhouse in January. Audiences are 
ushered into a simulated remote broadcast of a radio station and are given a 
chance to perform, be interviewed and help solve a crime. There are five 
endings, depending on the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The show will run Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. It is not 
a dinner show, but the seating is cabaret style, and waitresses and waiters 
serve drinks throughout the evening.

HEARINGS OKD ON INSURANCE RATE ROLLBACKS; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: JUDGE RULES THAT CHALLENGES TO A REBATE ORDER SHOULD ONLY COME 
AFTER A COMPANY IS TOLD BY THE COMMISSIONER TO GRANT THE REBATES.

<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled against the insurance industry Tuesday 
and gave Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie the go-ahead for an immediate 
start of company rate rollback hearings under terms of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that she had changed her mind after further study of the legal 
issues, Judge Dzintra Janavs said that the time for a legal challenge of 
Gillespie's standard for judging whether a company will have to grant rebates 
of 1989 premiums is after a company receives a specific rollback order, not 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gillespie's standard, any company found to have had profits exceeding 
11.2% in 1989 in auto, homeowner, commercial and other lines combined will be 
ordered to rebate the difference to its customers up to a maximum of 20% of the 
total premium. The companies will also be required to pay 10% interest on the 
sums owed since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Five leading insurance companies -- USAA, Progressive, Safeco, Allstate and the 
California State Auto Assn. -- had contended that they should be permitted to 
challenge Gillespie's 11.2% standard before any specific company hearings 
began, thus adding another lengthy round of litigation to what has already been 
a two-year industry fight against implementing Proposition 103 rollback 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
These insurers had been supported in court by scores of other insurers, and at 
first Janavs indicated she would go along. She delayed hearings that Gillespie 
had scheduled for the five companies on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
But at a lengthy hearing Monday and in her ruling Tuesday, Janavs said she had 
concluded that Gillespie's rollback rules were not final until she had directed 
companies to actually rebate some money. All such administrative proceedings 
must be complete before the companies can legally challenge them, she ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Janavs' decision, and two others she made Monday, indicated she might be more 
consumer-oriented and less industry-oriented than a prior judge assigned to 
hear Proposition 103 cases. That judge, Miriam Vogel, yielded the cases to 
Janavs when she was promoted by Gov. George Deukmejian from the Superior Court 
to the state Court of Appeal. On Monday, Janavs also dismissed company lawsuits 
aimed at overturning requirements that they sell assigned-risk auto policies at 
the current, relatively low rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie aides said that the commissioner will now go ahead with one or more 
company rollback hearings as soon as she can give proper legal notice. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's special counsel for Proposition 103 implementation, Karl 
Rubinstein, said he expects the companies that are first ordered to rebate 
money will challenge the order in court, and this will form a test case on 
Gillespie's standards. Once the courts ruled on it, he said, all other 
companies would be forced to comply in quick order with any rollback standards 
that had been upheld. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie had originally vowed to complete all rollback-rebate decisions by 
last November, but lengthy hearings and court challenges by the industry have 
held her up.

OPPOSITION PARTIES WIN PLACE IN MONGOLIA CABINET 
</P>

<P>
Elections in Communist-ruled Mongolia have given opposition parties nearly 40% 
of the seats in a key legislative body, according to results released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party chief Gombojavyn Ochirbat, speaking at a news conference in the 
Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, said opposition representatives will be 
invited to join the new government's Cabinet. This step is "vital for political 
stability and national unity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly all votes counted from Sunday's balloting, election officials 
announced that the Communists had captured 80% of the seats in the 430-member 
People's Great Hural, which elects the nation's president, and about 60% of the 
seats in the 53-member Small Hural, which is the regularly functioning 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The election results mark "the end of orthodox communism in Mongolia," 
Baterdeniyn Batbayar, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said 
at a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time our people were under the exploitation of communism," Batbayar 
said. "Now we are just coming from the darkness into a bright future." 
</P>
<P>
The election law requires seats in the Small Hural to be allocated according to 
a party preference poll that was on Sunday's ballot. This procedure helped 
Mongolia's fledgling opposition parties, which were legalized only a few months 
ago, to compete more effectively in the race for this legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, as the Communists are officially 
known, won 343 seats in the Great Hural, election officials said. The Mongolian 
Democratic Party won 23 seats, the National Progress Party won 7, the Social 
Democratic Party won 4 and independents or minor party candidates won 25 seats. 
New elections may be required in 28 districts, in most cases because no 
candidate won a majority. 
</P>
<P>
In the party preference poll for the Small Hural, the Mongolian Democratic 
Party took 24% of the votes, the National Progress Party had 6% and the Social 
Democratic Party had 5%. 
</P>
<P>
U.S., British and Soviet observers have said the elections seemed basically 
free and honest, despite some isolated problems. The voting system, however, 
was weighted in favor of rural residents, who supported the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The elections, the first free multi-party balloting in Mongolia's history, 
climaxed eight months of dramatic political change that began with dissident 
rallies in December. The Communists, influenced by the wave of political 
liberalization sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, responded with a 
conciliatory stance.

IRA CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR BRITON'S DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
CAR BOMBING: THE OUTLAWED IRISH GROUP SAYS THE LAWMAKER WAS TARGETED BECAUSE HE 
WAS THATCHER'S 'CLOSE CONFIDANT.' 
</P>

<P>
Vowing that it "will continue to strike whenever and wherever the opportunity 
arises," the Irish Republican Army on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the 
car bombing that killed senior British lawmaker Ian Gow and added that the 
vocal IRA critic was targeted because he was "a close confidant" of Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
As police reconstructed bomb fragments and combed hotels, chalets and 
campgrounds in search of witnesses and possible suspects, the IRA declared in a 
statement that it will continue the bombings until the British government 
"abandons its futile military campaign, ends partition (of Ireland) and 
recognizes the Irish people's right to self-determination and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
A grieving Thatcher announced, however, that the government will hold to its 
hard-line approach to the embattled Irish province. At the same time, Scotland 
Yard began an intensive review of security for all members of Parliament, who 
do not qualify for the 24-hour protection provided to British officials 
residing in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Gow, which occurred in the driveway of his modest country home 
Monday, was the 12th claimed by the IRA this year and the 17th since it 
launched its current round of violence last September. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier casualties have included police officers, soldiers and a Roman Catholic 
nun. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were charged Friday with last week's murder in Northern Ireland of that 
nun and three police officers in a land-mine explosion near the Irish border. 
Henry McCartney, 26, and Tarlac Connolly, 29, both of Armagh, were ordered held 
until Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the IRA's bombing sites have been major symbols of Thatcher's 
government, among them her Conservative Party's elite supper club in central 
London and the London Stock Exchange building. 
</P>
<P>
Gow, however, was the first ruling-party Parliament member killed since the 
IRA's bold 1984 bombing at the Brighton Hotel, where Thatcher was conducting a 
party conference. His murder unleashed a torrent of anger, shock and horror 
throughout British society Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that Gow's death was "a direct assault on parliamentary democracy," a 
prestigious London daily newspaper, The Independent, stressed, in its lead 
editorial, the futility of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"Like all such murders, yesterday's was not only repellently heartless but also 
profoundly stupid," it declared. 
</P>
<P>
The Times of London, in condemning the killing as part of an IRA "strategy of 
subversion by terror," strongly cautioned the government against overreacting. 
The IRA, the newspaper declared, "would like to see ministers encased in 
bulletproof armor, railings go up round public buildings, public engagements 
canceled, Irishmen and women martyred by hanging, free speech curtailed. . . . 
It wants a Britain consumed by hysterical reaction, a Britain on the run, 
publicly terrified." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, in an interview with Britain's Independent Television Network, 
indicated that the government already is providing as much security as it can. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not possible to protect everyone, all the time," she said, still visibly 
shaken by the killing of a man who had served not only as her private 
parliamentary secretary but also a close friend to whom she turned for solace. 
"But I assure you, we do as much as we possibly can -- and will continue to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
In its statement Tuesday, the IRA tried to blunt the onslaught of public 
outrage. "Republicans, all too familiar with suffering, will not rejoice or 
take pleasure from Ian Gow's death. We know all grief is the same," it 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
At Gow's home in Hankham, East Sussex, where dozens of floral bouquets were 
piled high just outside the gate, the victim's widow issued a statement of her 
own to the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
"You will never win," Jane Gow declared in a statement read by a policeman in 
front of the family home. "We have lost the dearest person in the world, but it 
will not diminish our resolve to be as strong as he was in fighting this 
terrible wickedness."

EDUCATION / STOPPING WHITE FLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
GROUP CAMPAIGNS TO IMPROVE IMAGE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLSAN EX-SCHOOLTEACHER JOINS THE 
MOVEMENT TO DISCOURAGE MIDDLE-CLASS PARENTS FROM RELYING ON PRIVATE ACADEMIES.

Maud DeLes Lancaster is a product of public schools in Jackson, Miss. In the 
early 1970s, she watched as more than two-thirds of her white classmates fled 
to the segregation academies that sprang up when Jackson was ordered to 
integrate its schools. 
</P>
<P>
And today, as she prepares her 3-year-old daughter to enter kindergarten at her 
neighborhood public school, she finds herself again bucking the trend among 
middle-class, white families like hers. But this time, she's hoping to bring 
many of those middle-class, white families along with her. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster is one of more than 300 people in Jackson with the same goal who have 
joined Parents for Public Schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people who have chosen not to attend public school have never 
stepped into the door," Lancaster said. "It's like a girl who gets a bad 
reputation. . . . It may not be true, but what can you do to stop it?" 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN GOALS: What the group is doing is staging a massive campaign to stress 
how good the schools are. They are using television commercials, newspaper ads 
and billboards featuring prominent citizens who send their children to public 
school and touting the financial wisdom of forsaking the city's expensive, 
all-white private schools. 
</P>
<P>
The effort was organized in March with the help of Mississippi Secretary of 
State Dick Molpus -- whose two children attend Jackson public schools -- and 
has raised more than $200,000 for its media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to tell whether the campaign will significantly alter the racial 
composition of the 33,000-student school district, which is almost 80% black. 
But more informal efforts have succeeded in increasing white enrollment at 
several schools in mostly white northeast Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
A former public schoolteacher, Lancaster took part in one of those efforts last 
year when she discovered that many of her neighbors planned to send their 
children to private schools. So she formed a group with others "who liked the 
idea of a neighborhood school" to support Boyd Elementary, the local public 
school, which is more than 65% black. 
</P>
<P>
Her group, and others like it, merged with Parents for Public Schools, which 
relies heavily on parent-to-parent networking -- arranging public school tours 
for preschool and private school families, hosting parties and play groups, and 
visiting local preschools to talk with parents. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster is quick to caution that the campaign is not about "saving" the city 
schools through an infusion of white students. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to bring in more white people for our own comfort level or to 
make the schools any better," she said. "The schools are already good. I just 
feel that all of us, children from all walks of life and experiences, should be 
able to go to school together." 
</P>
<P>
White flight -- or middle-class flight, as some call it -- is no new phenomenon 
in urban districts. In some cities, like Jackson and Los Angeles, the loss of 
families moving to suburbia was exacerbated by whites fleeing from cross-town 
busing used to desegregate schools. 
</P>
<P>
IMPACT: Efforts to stem that flight also are not new, although virtually all of 
them have been sponsored by school districts or business and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very much an issue that has come to be of concern nationally," said 
Barbara Probst, executive director of the New York Alliance for Public Schools, 
a coalition of business, education and community leaders that began its 
campaign to "raise awareness of public school as an option" in New York City in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Molpus said his office checked with "every major urban center in America" and 
found no similar parent-based effort under way anywhere. "But since we've 
started, we've gotten calls from all over the country -- New Jersey, New York, 
Louisiana -- from parents asking how to start their own groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in educational reform for all my career, but I've never 
seen anything with the power of this," Molpus said. "If this works, we think it 
can serve as a beacon for this nation. It really is a symbol of hope and unity 
for the public school system."

BREAK-IN HELD EFFORT TO HIDE NIXON'S MONEY LINK TO GREECE

Despite FBI investigations and the risk of deportation, Elias Demetracopoulos 
has tried to tell the world that Greece's former military dictatorship 
illegally contributed more than half a million dollars to Richard M. Nixon's 
1968 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after 20 years, a respected historian has joined Demetracopoulos in 
his lonely battle, publishing a book that suggests the Watergate break-in was 
likely intended to obliterate evidence of Nixon's Greek connection. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of exposure of the dictatorship's financial contribution "caused the 
most anxiety for the longest period of time for the Nixon Administration," 
concludes University of Wisconsin professor Stanley I. Kutler in "The Wars of 
Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
Kutler relates that in 1968, Demetracopoulos gave Democratic Party operative 
Lawrence F. O'Brien evidence that Greece's intelligence service, KYP, funneled 
$549,000 in cash into the Nixon campaign. Kutler says that the KYP used a 
Greek-American businessman, Thomas Pappas, as the conduit. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, then campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate Hubert H. 
Humphrey, made no use of the information in 1968. But in 1972, when he was 
Democratic Party national chairman, he presumably still had the evidence in his 
files. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy as saying the break-in "was to 
find out what O'Brien had of a derogatory nature about us," Kutler concludes 
that the burglars were probably after the 1968 Greek documents. 
</P>
<P>
"I find vindication in this book," said Demetracopoulos, a former journalist, 
in an interview. "Kutler is a respected academic." 
</P>
<P>
Although Demetracopoulos is credited as the primary source for the information 
in the Kutler book, the professor subjected the story to a rigorous examination 
and deemed it credible. 
</P>
<P>
Demetracopoulos said O'Brien never really tried to get the story out, even 
though it could have damaged Nixon and provided a major boost to Humphrey in 
1968 and George S. McGovern in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions to U.S. elections by foreign governments are illegal, and the 
Greek regime, supported by Nixon, was a military junta that had ousted a 
democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Brien denied suppressing the information, suggesting he lacked supporting 
evidence of Demetracopoulos' claims. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be sure that if we had any information of this nature that had been 
verified, we most certainly would have released it," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Demetracopoulos was a political editor and diplomatic correspondent in Greece 
before fleeing in 1967 following the military coup. In the United States, he 
became a leader and frequent spokesman for the democratic resistance. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1968, he offered Democrats a summary of the evidence by phone, 
even though he was afraid his line was tapped. 
</P>
<P>
It probably was, because the FBI said in 1984 that it had conducted six 
investigations of the Greek journalist, although they never provided evidence 
of wrongdoing. There are ample indications that Nixon aides learned quite early 
about Demetracopoulos' 1968 meeting with O'Brien, and threatened the Greek 
journalist with deportation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that O'Brien was excited about the information, but was unsure how to 
confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien eventually issued a cryptic press release during the final week of the 
campaign calling on Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew "to explain their relationships 
with Thomas A. Pappas, a wealthy Boston importer." It did not even hint at an 
illegal campaign contribution by the Greek colonels. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the issue had no impact on the 1968 election.

GALVESTON OIL SPILL WASHES ASHORE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: WILDLIFE OFFICIAL SAYS MARSHLANDS COULD BE DEVASTATED, BUT THE 
COAST GUARD CALLS THE SITUATION 'MANAGEABLE.'

<P>
Oil from a huge spill in Galveston Bay began washing ashore Tuesday, 
threatening an environmentally sensitive shoreline that is the nesting place 
for thousands of birds and also one of the prime fisheries along the Texas 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 gallons of oil have escaped into the bay since a tanker-barge 
collision Saturday, and one state parks and wildlife official said the danger 
was such that the marshlands could be devastated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heading toward worst case," said Larry McKinney, the director of the 
resource protection division of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Division. "What is 
happening is as bad as we could ever predict." 
</P>
<P>
However, others took exception to that gloomy outlook, including U.S. Coast 
Guard Rear Adm. James Loy, who flew over the bay Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Loy said the spill looked like a "very manageable situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a pretty good handle on the environmentally sensitive areas," 
he said at a midafternoon press conference. "My aerial observation did not give 
me that same sense of foreboding." 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup crews were using five skimmer vessels and a vacuum truck to suck up oil 
contained by thousands of feet of booms. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill is the second within the last two months to affect the Galveston 
Bay area. The first was an explosion aboard the tanker Mega Borg on June 9. The 
tanker burned out of control for days and almost 4 million gallons of oil were 
spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. For a time, it appeared the Mega Borg might 
eclipse the Valdez disaster because it carried three times more oil than the 
Exxon tanker that ran aground off the coast of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The accident Saturday occurred when two of three barges being pushed by a tug 
boat collided with a tanker in the Houston Ship Channel, a deep trench that 
cuts through Galveston Bay. First indications were that it was a relatively 
minor spill. But late Monday afternoon, the Coast Guard revised its estimate to 
500,000 gallons after divers discovered that damage to one of the barges was 
much more severe that originally believed. No oil has spilled since Monday 
evening, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
What worried environmental experts about the bay spill was that it was already 
so close to the shoreline. At midafternoon, the sheen from the spill was more 
than eight miles long and four to five miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Loy said Coast Guard Capt. Tom Greene, the federal on-site coordinator, 
said the oil had washed ashore in some portions of the bay and that there had 
been some reports of birds that were covered with oil. 
</P>
<P>
At least 100 bird species, including the endangered brown pelican, and at least 
75 kinds of fish inhabit the Galveston Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for state Lands Commissioner Garry Mauro said that Texas 
must improve its response time to these potentially disastrous spills. Mauro 
has been urging such preparations since the Exxon Valdez disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Garry has been hollering about a preparedness plan all this time, but it's not 
there," said spokesman Jeff Long. "No one has ever put it together. The 
response has been slow and we're real unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
David Hankla, the Houston-area field supervisor for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Department, said one of the problems is the proximity of wildlife to the heavy 
industry of the Houston Ship Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make all of it mix and match together, to maintain a 
productive system for the long term, but it's not easy," he said. "On this 
spill, we're just holding our breath." 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Loy also announced that the ship channel was to reopen 
Tuesday afternoon. The channel's closure was costing shippers about $1.5 
million a day.

Photo, Slick Trouble: Oil from a huge spill in Galveston Bay -- the second in 
two months in the area -- began washing ashore in Texas, threatening an 
environmentally sensitive shoreline that is the nesting place for thousands of 
birds. More than 500,000 gallons of oil have escaped into the bay since the 
tanker-barge collision on Saturday. Said one official about the possible 
damage: "What is happening is as bad as we could ever predict." Others, 
however, disagreed. Skimmer vessel, in background, continued its cleanup

FEARS OF N-WASTE TANK BLAST PROMPT TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
RADIOACTIVITY: SCIENTISTS PLAN TO TAKE SAMPLES FROM A VAST TANK AT HANFORD, 
WASH., THAT IS EXPERIENCING A BUILDUP OF FLAMMABLE HYDROGEN GAS.

<P>
Concerned over the potential for chemical explosions in tanks of liquid nuclear 
waste, scientists have laid plans to take crucial samples from a million-gallon 
container of radioactive brew buried at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear weapons 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
The operation comes in the wake of new warnings that the buildup of gas in 
steel waste tanks could cause explosions powerful enough to rupture them and 
cause disastrous releases of high-level radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that we know there is definitely a high risk, but there is 
potentially a high risk," said John Ahearne in testimony before the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday. Ahearne is chairman of the Energy 
Department's Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), the committee chairman, said that some Hanford tanks 
could have an explosive potential of 36 tons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
Ahearne and other independent experts told the committee that urgent priority 
should be given to fully understanding chemical reactions taking place in the 
waste tanks as a first step toward solving one of the country's most delicate 
refuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Westinghouse Hanford Co., which maintains the Department of 
Energy's huge radioactive tank farm, has assembled a team of experts to sample 
the contents of the most troublesome tank, the SY-101. 
</P>
<P>
The double-walled tank periodically "burps" as hydrogen gas builds up in the 
waste material and breaks through a solid crust that forms on the surface of 
the waste. It is then released through filtered vents. 
</P>
<P>
While numerous investigations over the years have concluded that the risk of 
tank explosions is low, Ahearne's committee told Energy Secretary James D. 
Watkins last week that the Hanford situation must be regarded as serious. 
</P>
<P>
The Ahearne panel report was followed Tuesday with one from the Energy 
Department's own Office of Nuclear Safety, which said that operating 
contractors at Hanford have been aware of the problem of gas generation in 
SY-101 for 13 years but have done nothing to alleviate the danger of 
combustion. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that DOE officials, as well as those from Westinghouse, 
Rockwell Hanford Operations and Atlantic Richfield Hanford Co., "failed to 
exercise appropriate safety oversight of tank operations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The deficiencies were attributed to many factors, including "a degree of 
complacency, lack of discipline in operations, poor management, primacy of 
production over safety . . . (and) inadequate training and staffing," said 
Steven M. Blush, director of the Nuclear Safety Office. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanford tank farm has 177 tanks holding some 200,000 cubic meters of waste 
generated in plutonium production operations going back to the early 1940s. 
Sixty-six of the tanks are known or suspected of leaking, and 23 are a source 
of concern over gas generation. 
</P>
<P>
Another vast quantity of similar waste is stored at another tank farm at the 
Energy Department's facility at Savannah River, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of the Hanford tank farm is far more serious because organic 
materials were added to its tanks, and the materials accelerated the production 
of hydrogen gas in the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Because the buried tanks have sat for decades, Ahearne told the Senate panel, 
there is great uncertainty about the chemical reactions taking place, and in 
many cases, about the kinds of material put into them in the first place.

SAFETY PANEL SPREADS BLAME IN EXXON SPILL 
</P>

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its first official finding of fault in last year's Exxon Valdez oil spill in 
Prince William Sound, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday 
that all parties involved share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, and his crew should have been less 
fatigued and more alert, Exxon Corp. should have monitored more closely the 
alcohol treatment program in which Hazelwood was enrolled. And the Coast 
Guard's Vessel Traffic Service was inadequate, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
Had any one of these parties been more vigilant, "we could have avoided this 
accident," said NTSB member John K. Lauber. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were unveiled in Washington as NTSB staff members and senior 
officials met to assess their research about the disaster, caused when the 
tanker ruptured on March 24, 1989, after colliding with a reef in the sound. 
The 11-million-gallon oil spill, which has cost $2 billion so far to clean up, 
is the nation's largest and costliest. 
</P>
<P>
The board recommended that all companies operating oil tankers in Prince 
William Sound start alcohol treatment programs for employees, discourage crew 
members from working excessively long hours and train and monitor employees who 
are alcoholics and drug addicts to prevent relapses. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate finding, the board said that Hazelwood's decision to leave his 
third mate in charge of the tanker the night of the spill "was contrary to 
federal regulations and Exxon policy and was improper, given the course of the 
vessel." The board concluded that the mate was impaired by fatigue, which 
contributed to the collision with the reef. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also concluded that the judgment of the ship's skipper "was 
impaired by alcohol" during the critical period when the vessel was stuck on 
the reef and starting to lose oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We had eyewitnesses" who saw the captain and smelled his breath the night of 
the disaster, said NTSB Chairman James L. Kolstad. 
</P>
<P>
The agency conducted its own tests and voice analyses to make sure that it did 
not accuse Hazelwood without hard evidence, Kolstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. Russo, Hazelwood's attorney, said that the board's efforts to prove 
his client was intoxicated were "feeble." 
</P>
<P>
"Their conclusions are not founded in the evidence," Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of 
oil. He was fined $50,000 and ordered to spend 1,000 hours cleaning Alaskan 
beaches. He has appealed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and misconduct 
against Hazelwood but suspended his license as a ship's master for nine months 
after he pleaded no contest to breaking Coast Guard rules. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Kolstad said the board hopes its report, which included 36 
safety recommendations, will help prevent future spills. Its analysis carries 
no force of law and, by statute, cannot be used in court cases.

LOW COCAINE SUPPLY CITED AS U.S. MURDER TOLL SOARS

America's murder toll may break a decade-old record this year, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee said Tuesday. It blamed rising stockpiles of assault 
weapons and shrinking supplies of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
If the pace of killing continues, the committee said, 23,220 people will be 
murdered this year. That figure would make it, in the words of the panel's 
chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), "the bloodiest year in American 
history." 
</P>
<P>
The panel said that murders are projected to top last year's total by 2,000 and 
exceed even the record of 23,040 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The current murder rate of 10.5 per 100,000 people makes the United States "the 
most murderous industrialized nation" in the world, the panel said. In Great 
Britain, the rate is 0.8 per 100,000; in Japan, 1.0, and in West Germany, 1.2. 
</P>
<P>
As reasons for the soaring murder toll, the committee cited: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dwindling supplies of cocaine in major cities, which it said has ignited 
drug turf wars. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A growing arsenal of assault weapons in the hands of drug dealers and other 
lawbreakers. "These firearms have become the weapons of choice for drug dealers 
and the weapons of doom for law enforcement personnel," the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A fresh wave of jobless, crime-prone teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that the murder toll "began to rise significantly in the late 
1960s and did not fall until the early 1980s. . . . This trend followed from an 
unusually large number of 18- to 24-year-olds in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
"This age group is the most violent one, and the murder toll often swells with 
its ranks." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's murder total fell 18% from 1980 to 1985, but it has risen 22% 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. J. Lawrence Cogan, chief medical examiner of Los Angeles County, said that, 
as drug wars sweep inner-city street corners, he is "seeing more cases of 
multiple gunshot wounds, and many of these involving high-velocity firearms." 
</P>
<P>
Biden urged swift House action on a Senate-passed bill that would ban nine 
semiautomatic assault weapons and impose the death penalty for 34 federal 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on FBI figures, the committee said that California led the nation in 
murders last year with 3,158. The panel projected violent deaths this year in 
the nation's most-populous state at 3,442, a 9% increase.

GOP AD ON S&amp;L CRISIS INFURIATES DEMOCRATS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS' CONFERENCE ENDS IN PARTISAN DISCORD. BUSH'S 
HANDLING OF PROBE IS CRITICIZED AS RIVAL PARTY VOWS RETALIATION.

<P>
The National Governors' Assn. conference concluded here Tuesday on a harsh note 
of partisan discord as Republicans and Democrats each sought to blame the other 
for the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP got in the first shot with an ad taking up nearly three-quarters of a 
page in the Mobile Register displaying photos of 12 present and former 
Democratic congressman and senators over the headline: "These are the guys who 
let the S&amp;L problem explode into a $325-billion national crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Infuriated Democratic governors, gathered at a breakfast meeting to discuss 
1990 campaign strategy, responded by adopting a resolution criticizing the Bush 
Administration's handling of the savings and loan investigation and calling for 
appointment of an independent prosecutor "to investigate charges of fraud, 
mismanagement and criminal activities associated with sick thrifts." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats vowed to retaliate more directly with countercharges of their own, 
some pointing out that the party's failure to rebut Republican attacks in the 
1988 presidential campaign contributed to the defeat of their standard-bearer, 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. "Let's not make the same mistake Mike 
Dukakis made in 1988," Dukakis himself told a reporter after the breakfast 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats specifically recalled 1988 GOP charges that the crimes committed 
by Massachusetts convict Willie Horton while he was on a weekend furlough were 
a sign of Dukakis' permissiveness. Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste, head of the 
Democratic Governors' Assn., said: "If there is a Willie Horton on S&amp;Ls, 
it's Neil Bush," a reference to the President's son, who has been accused of 
conflict of interest as a member of the board of directors of a Denver savings 
and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the three-day meeting, Democratic governors received approval from 
the association's executive committee for a resolution calling for creation of 
an independent commission to investigate the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican governors grumbled then that the Democrats were trying to shift 
the blame for the mess from Congress to the Administration and were also 
seeking to the give the impression that the Administration's handling of the 
affair was faulty. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a modified version of the proposal was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican governors seemed pleased with the latest attack on their 
Democratic counterparts. "The Democrats are the ones who are trying to make the 
most political hay out of this disaster for American taxpayers," Republican 
Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine said in an interview. "The Republicans want 
to make sure people know there's enough blame to go around."

GENE MAY INCREASE RISK OF LUNG CANCER; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE FINDING BY LOUISIANA RESEARCHERS SUPPORTS THE THEORY THAT THE 
DISEASE CAN RESULT FROM AN INTERACTION BETWEEN GENETICS AND LIFESTYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new examination of lung cancer within families suggests that an unidentified 
gene may increase a person's risk of the disease -- a finding that supports the 
theory that lung cancer, like other diseases, can result from an interaction of 
genetics and lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published todaywed in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 
suggests that people with the gene are more likely than others to develop lung 
cancer relatively early in life, particularly if they smoke or are exposed to 
certain other carcinogens. Traditionally, it was thought that lung cancer 
resulted solely from environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers emphasized Tuesday that the theory remains to be proven by 
pinpointing the gene and determining how it works. The current study was based 
solely on observation of lung cancer patterns in families, not on an analysis 
of genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
"It would mean that . . . it's a disease that has many different causes," said 
Dr. Henry Rothschild, a co-author of the paper. "(If) there is a group of 
people that have a gene that makes them more susceptible . . . preventive 
measures (such as anti-smoking programs) could be taken in those people." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also stressed that smoking and other environmental factors are 
more important than genetics in lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It has been known for several decades that lung cancer can "cluster" in 
families. It is also well known that smoking and exposure to workplace 
carcinogens can cause lung cancer, although some people are believed to be more 
susceptible than others. 
</P>
<P>
In the new study, researchers at Louisiana State University Medical Center 
studied 337 families of people who had died of cancer. Many of Louisiana's 
parishes have lung cancer death rates that rank among the highest in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers explored who in each family had developed cancer, at what age 
and under what conditions. Taking those factors into account, they say they 
found disease patterns consistent with accepted patterns of inheritance first 
identified by Gregor Mendel, founder of modern genetics. 
</P>
<P>
The group suggested that the gene accelerates the early onset of cancer. It 
appeared to play a significant role in cancers that developed in middle age. By 
contrast, most cancers occurring in old age were attributed to smoking alone. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how the gene might exert its effect. But epidemiologist Thomas 
A. Sellers, who headed the study, said the gene might affect the way people 
metabolize potentially carcinogenic material in cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance (of this) is that once you isolate one specific mechanism, you 
can see how that disease is caused," Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers acknowledged that it is possible his theory is wrong and that perhaps 
unidentified environmental factors are mimicking genetic patterns. But he said 
that seemed unlikely because "the genetic model fits the data so well." 
</P>
<P>
He said the group intends next to try to identify the gene through studies of 
DNA. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial accompanying the paper in the journal, George E. Bonney of 
Howard University Cancer Center said the paper provides some of "the first 
strong evidence for gene-environment-lifestyle interactions" in the development 
of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But Bonney added, "Finding (the gene) will provide the ultimate proof of its 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, a professor of medicine and genetics at the University of 
Washington , said the study adds new information to the field of so-called 
ecogenetics -- the study of the interaction of heredity and environment. 
</P>
<P>
"If one could find out that you, and not I, are highly susceptible to the 
carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoking, you might think twice about 
smoking," he said.

The Comanche Peak nuclear power plant experienced its third "unusual event" in 
four months with the release of non-radioactive steam into the atmosphere, 
utility officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Steam was released late Monday from the only operable reactor in the 
twin-reactor plant when a steam relief valve apparently malfunctioned and 
opened too wide. 
</P>
<P>
An "unusual event" is the lowest of four categories of emergencies defined by 
regulators. There never was a threat to the public, a plant spokesman said.

Landlady Dorothea Puente will stand trial March 13 on charges she murdered nine 
people. Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Jack Sapunor set the date based 
on when attorneys said they could begin. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last at least six months. Puente, 61, was arrested in 
November, 1988, after authorities unearthed the bodies of seven tenants from 
the yard of her downtown Sacramento boardinghouse. Prosecutors allege she 
poisoned the tenants and two others for their government benefit checks. The 
defense contends the victims died either of natural causes or, in one case, 
suicide. "There's been no credible evidence to show that these people died at 
the hands of another," Assistant Public Defender Peter Vlautin told reporters. 
"Dorothea Puente isn't guilty of the charges." Puente could face the death 
penalty if convicted. She remains jailed without bail.

Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, a San Francisco landmark for 67 years, 
will close and move to a new, $65-million hospital in Sacramento in 1993. 
There's been no discussions about the future of the 48-bed facility on 4.7 
acres in the Sunset District or how many of the 200 staff members might move to 
the state capital, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Shriners officials said they saw no indication that the annual East-West Shrine 
college football game would be moved from Stanford University. The fraternal 
and charitable organization, which operates 22 hospitals offering free medical 
care, plans to build its new, 80-bed pediatric hospital on 4.8 acres at UC 
Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The new hospital would be the first in the 
Shriners' system to treat under one roof children with spinal-cord injuries, 
orthopedic problems and burns.

A NEW BOSS FOR NEW YORK?;

YANKEES: STEINBRENNER WANTS TO TURN DAILY OPERATION OF THE TEAM OVER TO HIS 
SON, FRANK

Will the new Boss be the son of the old Boss? 
</P>
<P>
If George Steinbrenner turns over day-to-day operations of the New York Yankees 
to his 33-year-old son Hank, more than the names may remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Steinbrenner started in baseball as a 13-year-old recommending trades and 
second-guessing Yankee management -- including his father -- on player moves 
and manager selection. 
</P>
<P>
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
"I was a statistical freak," he once said. "Like most kids I studied the 
boxscores and the averages every day. And every so often, I'd make suggestions 
to George." 
</P>
<P>
He has been credited for the Yankees' 1976 acquisition of pitcher Doyle 
Alexander from Baltimore. In 1986, when the Yankees hired Lou Piniella as 
manager, Hank was also involved. 
</P>
<P>
And current Yankee manager Stump Merrill shouldn't feel a sudden surge of job 
security just because George was forced by baseball to give up day-to-day 
control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Though father Steinbrenner made 18 managerial changes in 18 years, little 
Steinbrenner spoke up in 1985 when dad was debating whether to fire Billy 
Martin after a barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to fire Billy, don't use the Baltimore fights as an excuse," Hank 
said at the time, according to a New York Times story. "Use the way he messed 
up the pitching staff and the moves he made late in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Greene, who was a team spokesman at the time, said that although the 
younger Steinbrenner never held an official capacity with the team, "he was 
involved in minor league operations." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else is known about him, Hank Steinbrenner has already shown a 
capacity for honesty. When he was asked a few years ago how to improve the 
team, he said: "Get rid of my father."

AIRPORT WARS: Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz 
(D-Panorama City) is announcing his support today for a monorail that would 
link L.A. and Palmdale, boosting plans to build an international airport there. 
. . . Orange County supervisors favor an airport at George Air Force Base in 
San Bernardino County. Katz's move "concerns me," says Orange County 
transportation chief Dana W. Reed, "because an airport in Palmdale does nothing 
to solve the serious airport congestion problem here." Jeffrey A. Perlman and

O.C. RENT FIRM IS ACCUSED OF DEPOSIT FRAUD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the most sweeping consumer actions ever mounted by the Orange County 
district attorney, prosecutors Tuesday filed suit against a Garden Grove 
property management firm accused of illegally withholding security deposits 
from hundreds of apartment renters. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein also issued a preliminary injunction 
against the firm, Elerding Properties, prohibiting its operators and employees 
from withholding refundable deposits, falsifying records, or inflating repair 
and cleaning bills sent to former tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that over the last four years, Elerding Properties has 
"engaged in and (is) still engaging in certain acts of unfair, unlawful and 
fraudulent business practices." It seeks restitution and at least $2,500 in 
penalties for each alleged violation, according to the complaint filed in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of affected renters is still being tallied, "This is one of 
the most widespread violations of consumer laws that our unit has had to deal 
with," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Chris Kralick of the office's consumer and 
environmental protection unit. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Elerding Properties have maintained that the firm is not guilty 
of any wrongdoing and that it will contest the lawsuit. The firm's lawyer, 
Arthur Morello, was unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Orange County Fair Housing Council say the failure of 
landlords to promptly refund security deposits is a significant problem that 
contributes to homelessness. During its last fiscal year, the agency received 
5,278 complaints of non-refunded security deposits valued at about $2.85 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these (renters) could not afford the loss of this money at a time that 
it was needed for relocation," fair housing officials wrote in a recent report 
to the Orange County Community Development Council. "Consequently, hundreds 
faced homelessness due to the wrongful taking of their deposits. . . . Many 
managers have virtually institutionalized their own process so as to be in a 
best position to take a helpless tenant's money." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported five weeks ago that at least 113 renters had filed small 
claims suits against Elerding and that the Marine Corps had taken the 
extraordinary step of removing the firm's 10 Orange County and two Los Angeles 
County complexes from its approved housing list. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred other former renters have not filed suit to recover their 
security deposits but have written letters of complaint to Elerding Properties, 
according to two company employees who asked not to be identified for fear of 
losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's complaint does not specify the number of alleged 
violations uncovered by investigators. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Kralick said 
several investigators have been working full-time during the last month to 
compile a complete list of the renters whose deposits were illegally withheld. 
</P>
<P>
"They are literally going through thousands of documents," Kralick said. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the list is completed, Kralick said he would file an amendment to 
the lawsuit along with a list of alleged building violations. The Orange County 
Environmental Health Division had received at least 43 complaints since January 
of 1989 of substandard housing conditions at some of the firm's apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names as defendants the estate of Dr. Charles E. Elerding Jr., his 
wife, Janet R. Elerding, two trusts held in each of their names, and their 
three sons -- Charles III, James and Joseph Elerding. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Elerding served as company president before he died of cancer last 
May. Two years ago, he was featured in Sports Illustrated when he and his wife 
provided a $1.75-million endowment to the USC football team -- the largest 
single contribution ever made to the school's athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also identifies 10 apartment complexes and 27 other properties 
owned and operated by the rental company. The Orange County complexes owned by 
Elerding include: Amberwood in Buena Park; Casa Madrid in Cypress; Mountain 
View Apartments and Villa Viejo Apartments in El Toro; City Park Plaza in 
Garden Grove; Huntington Apartments and Bahia Puerto in Huntington Beach; 
Tustin Arms Apartments in Orange, and Cerritos Apartments and Pine Tree 
Apartments in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Under the California Civil Code, a landlord is allowed to withhold all or part 
of a renter's security deposit to cover nonpayment of rent, clean the premises 
or repair "damages to the premises, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear." 
Within two weeks of the termination of a tenancy, the landlord is required to 
give every former renter an itemized statement listing the basis for any amount 
that is being withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Several renters' groups have charged that some landlords arbitrarily withhold 
the entire amount or a portion of the security deposit by claiming that the 
apartment needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the injunction specifically enjoins officials of Elerding Properties 
from "falsifying any 'vacating statements,' or inflating expenses listed on 
'vacating statements' when determining the cost of restoring a vacated unit to 
its original condition." 
</P>
<P>
As part of an agreement struck with the district attorney's office, Elerding 
Properties has agreed to make available to investigators copies of all written 
rental agreements for four years after the termination of each tenancy. The 
firm has also agreed to allow its employees and apartment managers to be 
interviewed by district attorney's investigators.

JUDGMENT CALL: Murder trials like the one of three men accused of the county's 
worst gang-related shooting, now being decided by two juries (B4), strain the 
county's Jury Services unit. Sometimes a single courtroom requires 250 
potential jurors a day. . . . Still, efficiency continues to rise (above). 
</P>
<P>
One key, says jury services manager Evelyn Valle, is the county's telephone 
alert system, which allows people to check in each morning to see whether they 
will be needed.

INDIGENT FEAR FOR THEIR HEALTH AS LOOMING BUDGET CUTBACKS THREATEN MEANS FOR 
CARE 
</P>

<P>
Poor people are plentiful in the 2000 block of West Walnut Street. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are homeless come to Center Park to spend the night. And those who 
are sick come to a nearby building that says "Community Clinic of Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, some of the poor at the clinic said they fear what will happen to 
them as a result of looming state and county budget cutbacks. The Indigent 
Medical Services program faces a serious slash. IMS is the safety net for the 
so-called "working poor," people not eligible for MediCal but who don't make 
enough to pay medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Obdulia Acosta, 36, of Santa Ana is one such person. As she left the clinic 
Tuesday afternoon, her eyes widened in fear when she heard people talking about 
possible reductions in medical aid to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago my son had an accident at school. He was taken to a hospital and 
they sent us a bill for $75 and one for $95, and we are not able to pay," she 
said. "So I know how expensive medical care is. We can't afford it. We rely on 
this clinic. I hope it is not true that they're cutting benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Reyna Gutierrez, 36, of Santa Ana said she had a special reason to be fearful 
of losing medical care. A doctor inside the clinic had just confirmed that she 
is pregnant, she said. It will be her fourth child. She relies on the clinic 
for prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried," she said, speaking softly in Spanish. "I've been coming here 
since 1986. This program helps a lot of people. I hope they don't take the 
program away." 
</P>
<P>
The poor who use IMS at the Santa Ana clinic, and at numerous other hospitals 
and clinics in Orange County, are all legal residents of the United States. 
They cannot get IMS eligibility cards unless they prove they are U.S. citizens 
or legal immigrants, medical officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials say that prompt medical checkups of new immigrants are 
critical to everyone's health. Tests can find communicable diseases and care 
can be given to prevent their spread. And immunization shots help keep the new 
immigrants healthy and self-supporting, the doctors point out. 
</P>
<P>
One family of new, legal immigrants came to the Community Clinic of Orange 
County on Tuesday. They said they were able to be there for medical checkups 
because of the IMS aid. 
</P>
<P>
The Ly family -- father, mother and three young-adult daughters -- arrived in 
Orange County only two weeks ago after a long journey from their native 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Our home was near Saigon," said the oldest daughter, Diem Ly, 22, speaking in 
fluent English. "We now live in Fullerton. We came here today for medical 
checkups." She said she hopes the IMS program cuts do not affect her family as 
it struggles to become self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
As the Vietnamese family left the clinic, a solitary man hobbled toward the 
entrance. Stratford Leonard, 40, of Santa Ana said his leg had gone bad. He was 
at the clinic for relief from the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard was philosophical about what would happen to him, and hundreds like 
him, if IMS cutbacks this year make it impossible for him to get care. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'd have to go the home remedy route," he said. "I guess I'd have to 
try Ace bandages and things like that." Then, thinking a minute, Leonard added: 
"Of course I couldn't operate on myself."

WATER SQUEEZE EASES; SO MAY BUILDING BAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With water conservation measures working and new sources of fresh water 
expected in August, the City Council will decide today whether to relax a 
7-month-old building moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by how the residents and homeowners associations have responded" 
to tough conservation laws passed by the council, said Greg Morehead, city 
water supervisor. "We feel that a sufficient amount of water is being conserved 
to allow a certain amount of growth." 
</P>
<P>
Water use in the city has dropped by about 600,000 gallons per day from last 
year, Morehead said. By mid-August, a new city well and a pipeline for 
reclaimed water are expected to begin operation and bring in an additional 
900,000 gallons daily. 
</P>
<P>
City staff is recommending that the council release a limited amount of 
building permits to developers whose projects have been on hold since the 
moratorium was imposed in January. 
</P>
<P>
The action would allow 250 homes to be built in addition to 35 acres of 
industrial and commercial development. Also, work could begin on 24 acres of 
new public parks on three sites in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's appropriate for city government to balance growth where 
water supplies are limited," Morehead said. "But when it's apparent that the 
supply is available, there is an obligation to relax the standards a little." 
</P>
<P>
The urgency ordinance was enacted after a near-crisis last summer when water 
levels at a reservoir serving the city sank from its 48-million-gallon capacity 
to an all-time low of 17.3 million gallons on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The council responded by passing a series of tough water conservation measures, 
including the building moratorium, restrictions on lawn watering and a 
surcharge for residents who use more than a city-alloted water quota. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a summer-long heat wave, area water officials say businesses and 
residents have learned to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
They point to the reservoir as a barometer. This week the reservoir held 40.5 
million gallons, compared to 25.3 million gallons on the same date last year, 
said Ray Woodside, general manager of the Tri-Cities Water District. 
</P>
<P>
"That's quite a difference," Woodside said. "We're holding on real good so 
far." FRANK MESSINA

A psychology student who says she spent two years and $12,000 to get a master's 
degree from Sierra University -- "A University Without Walls" in Costa Mesa, 
has sued that school, alleging fraud and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
Laurean Tahl, 30, of South Laguna goes to court Tuesday for a hearing in her 
suit, filed after state licensing officials told her the courses she took were 
inadequate and denied her a counseling license. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her graduation in 1987, the state granted Tahl a temporary counseling 
license and allowed her to work as a therapist for a year under supervision, 
she said. Then in 1988 state officials revoked the permit, explaining that 
whoever had processed the forms had been improperly trained, Tahl said. 
</P>
<P>
"It really shattered me. I've lost two years of my career." 
</P>
<P>
According to a catalogue from the correspondence school at 2900 Bristol St., 
Suite D-207, students meet weekly with tutors who review their progress and 
critique their written work. In addition to psychology, the school offers 
undergraduate and postgraduate programs in business, health, public 
administration, communications, computer science, criminal justice, education 
and human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra University is not accredited, but it is approved by the state to issue 
degrees in those fields, according to the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Tahl attended, she said, about 30 other students were enrolled in 
the clinical psychology program. The school was then headquartered in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bibeau, the university's president, could not be reached for comment. 
An answering service said he was out of town. The school door was locked and 
bore a note reading, "Please do not enter unless you have an appointment." 
</P>
<P>
Bibeau's attorney declined to comment on the case, but has said in papers filed 
in court that Tahl was adequately supervised and that the university had 
provided a program that met minimum standards set by the board of examiners, 
the state's licensing agency. 
</P>
<P>
Tahl said she will act as her own attorney at the hearing next week in Orange 
County Superior Court because she can't afford to hire counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Five similar complaints have been filed against the school with the Department 
of Education, said Mike Castro, a complaints coordinator the department. 
</P>
<P>
But Castro said the state is not investigating Sierra University because "five 
complaints is not an unusual number to receive against any private university." 
</P>
<P>
But aides at the office of state Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) 
said they are investigating Sierra, having found instructors with only 
community college experience teaching post-graduate classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sierra's administration has obviously gone beyond their responsibilities," 
Ferguson aide Mildred Murray said. "The question is why are these schools being 
approved or accredited?" 
</P>
<P>
Richard Leslie, an attorney for the California Assn. of Marriage and Family 
Therapists, said the association has received several complaints about Sierra 
University. He also is critical of the state approval process. 
</P>
<P>
"Many schools can't meet the strict requirements of accreditation, but some get 
state approval anyway," he said. CHERYLANNE BEALER

RIDGELINE PROTECTORS SAY PETITIONS FILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The organizers of a petition drive to support a proposed ordinance to protect 
undeveloped ridgelines in Laguna Niguel say they have gathered enough 
signatures to place the matter on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign received an unexpected boost from the controversy over the 
development of 96 acres of land that had been set aside for parks. That matter 
was disclosed in news reports of July 13, the day before the petition drive 
officially began. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are indeed angry about the parkland," said Paul Willems, a member 
of the Laguna Niguel Ridgeline Protection and Preservation Committee. "It's 
given impetus to our effort." 
</P>
<P>
By Friday afternoon, more than 4,300 signatures had been gathered, Willems 
said. About 3,600 signatures must be verified to qualify the ordinance for the 
ballot. The deadline for submitting the signatures is Aug. 10, and committee 
members say they will pursue the ballot measure if the City Council refuses to 
adopt the ordinance at its next meeting Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance calls for a 300-foot setback on both sides of ridgelines 
and would require that grading within 500 feet of hilltops be consistent with 
the slope of the land. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Willems said he asked Councilman James F. Krembas to place the 
matter on next Tuesday's council agenda, but interim City Manager Dan Miller 
said that request cannot be granted. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't anything specific to put on the agenda yet," he said. "The council 
has not had the benefit of staff analysis and legal analysis of the impacts of 
this initiative yet." 
</P>
<P>
A separate, city-prepared ridgeline protection ordinance is in the works and 
should be ready to present to the Planning Commission on Aug. 14, Miller said, 
adding: "We're moving on our own time line." 
</P>
<P>
If they do not get their initiative on the November ballot, committee members 
say, they will push for a special election. In signing the petition, committee 
chairman Richard Taylor said, many residents expressed sadness that it has 
taken so long to find a way to protect the hilltops, most of which are now 
dotted with development. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have stated they're sorry it didn't take place 10 years ago," 
he said. "And a lot of people are really disappointed there's so little to 
protect." 
</P>
<P>
The land-transaction controversy involves a 1988 deed that officials say gave 
Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. about 99 acres previously set aside for 
parkland. Krembas, then vice president of Laguna Niguel's Community Services 
District, signed the deed relinquishing the land where more than 100 homes have 
since been built. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas, who is under investigation by the Orange County district attorney, has 
denied any wrongdoing and said he mistakenly signed the public land deed, 
thinking it involved another transaction. LESLIE EARNEST

MAN, 70, KILLED AS CAR, TRUCK COLLIDE 
</P>

Royal Dean Fadely was trying to do his son a favor by taking a look at his 
dishwasher before the repairman came. When he left his son's condo Tuesday 
morning to return home, he was struck by a tractor-trailer and killed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Rialto resident Leanne Fargon, 30, was driving the truck carrying 
sand off a hill on Chapman Avenue just east of Crawford Canyon Road. Fadely, 
70, was driving south on Crawford Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said both vehicles were in the intersection when the truck struck the 
driver's side of Farley's white Thunderbird. Police could not determine who ran 
the red light. No traffic tickets were issued, and Fargon was released at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Fadely, a 17-year resident of Tustin and a retired advertising manager, was 
pronounced dead about 20 minutes after the accident while still pinned in his 
car. An official from the coroner's office said Fadely was wearing his seat 
belt but that it didn't help since the truck smashed directly into the door on 
the driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
Several area residents gathered around the scene and spoke about the frequent 
accidents that occur at the intersection, which is at the bottom of a hill 
outside Santiago Canyon, where a lot of construction work has taken place in 
the last few years, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Roper, a driver's education teacher at Santa Ana High School, has lived in 
a house about 100 feet from the intersection for about 10 years and said at 
least one serious accident happens there every six months. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have the green arrow at that intersection, you don't assume the other 
trucks are going to stop," he said, referring to facing traffic that is coming 
down the hill. He said he has often waited at a green turn signal while 
fast-moving vehicles, mostly trucks, ran red lights. He said that many car 
drivers also speed down Crawford Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
"No amount of engineering is going to stop an accident if someone runs a red 
light," said Chuck Glass, a traffic engineer with the city of Orange. He added 
that all city equipment in the area, including the lights, was working 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
Glass would not comment on the safety of the intersection compared to that of 
other intersections, but said that one fatal accident there every six months 
was possible. The speed limit on the hill just east of the intersection is 45 
m.p.h., he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city installed a traffic light about halfway down the hill several months 
ago, residents said, and the signal has helped slow traffic. Glass said the 
light was installed to accommodate traffic from new housing developments, not 
because of the truck traffic. LUCY CHABOT

CITY PROGRAMS ITSELF INTO COMPUTER ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach Utilities Director Bob Dixon would like to have every fire engine 
in the city equipped with a computer screen. When a 911 call comes in, a 
firefighter would use a laptop keyboard to enter the address into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
The machine would automatically map out the quickest route to the emergency, 
pinpointing the nearest hydrants and their current water pressure, marking the 
location of a nearby hazardous waste storage site and printing out the phone 
number of the building's owner. 
</P>
<P>
Just a wish list? Well, not in Newport Beach, where city planners are in the 
midst of putting together a comprehensive computer mapping and filing system. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the Geobase system, the 3-year-old project is a point of pride for 
Dixon, who argues that the data retrieval system will make city government more 
efficient and responsive. The system provides a way for city maps to be coded 
with layers and layers of information, ranging from the location of water mains 
to the typical traffic patterns during a weekend afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
With all that information in a central computer base, city planners, building 
inspectors and even residents will be able one day to plug into a single 
information network. The system would decrease the amount of time required to 
search maps or printouts and increase the level of accuracy and adherence to 
city standards, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The information has always been here, but there have been bits here and bits 
there," said utilities analyst Paul Malkemus. 
</P>
<P>
An advantage to the system is that the information retrieval will no longer be 
dependent on the department employees, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we had one gentleman who retired after 40 some years with the 
city," he said. "I realized that all that knowledge was retiring with him. In 
two years (with other retirements) we had something like 150 years of employee 
knowledge retire." 
</P>
<P>
Fiscal 1986 was the first year that the city spent money on the Geobase system. 
Since then, the average budget has set aside an average of $320,000 for the 
computer hardware, software and licensing agreements, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
But the department is still a long way from being finished. Dixon estimates 
that it will take another five to seven years for all the information to be 
keyed into the computer. And the project doesn't stop there, since the system 
will always have to be updated. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more important projects is converting maps, which for many years 
were drawn using the traditional grid system of the Spanish colonists. That 
method gave way to mapping through temporary landmarks such as trees or 
streets. The goal now is to generate maps digitally, using longitude and 
latitude as standard locaters. LAURA MICHAELIS

BANDIT BINDS CLERKS, ROBS JEWELRY STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man posing as a customer robbed a jewelry store at gunpoint Tuesday and 
escaped with an undetermined amount of merchandise, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The holdup occurred at 11 a.m. when the bandit entered Jewels by Mondonna at 
1280 Bison Ave. and ordered the two employees to the rear of the store, where 
he tied them up, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber then grabbed the jewels and fled through the back door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, one employee managed to free himself and activated the 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Police patrol units and a helicopter searched the area but were unable to 
locate the robber. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit was described as white with a tanned complexion, muscular build, 
about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. He has salt-and-pepper hair, a neatly trimmed 
beard and mustache and was wearing a gray sport coat and dark blue pants.

COUNTY'S MOST VIOLENT GANG-RELATED SHOOTING IN HANDS OF TWIN JURIES; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: DEFENDANTS DIDN'T CARE THAT 4-YEAR-OLD WAS KILLED, PROSECUTOR SAYS IN 
CLOSING ARGUMENT. 'THEY WANTED TO GET EVERYBODY.'

<P>
A 4-year-old boy was killed in the La Bonita Avenue shootings last September 
because the three defendants from the 5th Street gang didn't care whom they 
killed in an escalation of gang warfare in Orange County, a prosecutor told 
jurors this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It made no difference to them," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef. "They 
wanted to get everybody and they wanted to make an impression -- that they were 
macho." 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef, who completed his closing arguments Tuesday in a unique two-jury trial, 
argued that the county's worst shootings were a pay-back because a nephew of 
Louis P. Valadez, 28, one of the defendants, had been killed in an earlier gang 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
On trial with Valadez are Robert P. Figueroa, 20, and Roman G. Menchaca, 19. 
They are charged with the murders of Frankie Fernandez Jr., the little boy, and 
Miguel (Smokey) Navarro, 18, and the attempted murders of six other people who 
were wounded in the Sept. 16, 1989, shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that as a pickup truck moved slowly down the street just after 
dark, two young men in the back began firing at random toward the people on the 
sidewalk and in cars in the 13000 block of La Bonita Avenue, just north of 
Westminster Avenue in Garden Grove. The La Bonita address is considered turf 
for the 17th Street gang, a longtime rival of 5th Street's. 
</P>
<P>
Three young women who dodged bullets that night identified the three defendants 
and a juvenile, who is in custody and will be tried separately, as the 
assailants. The three women said they broke the gang code of silence and agreed 
to testify because of the little boy's death. Two of the women were his 
cousins. 
</P>
<P>
Several other victims said they could not identify the assailants but could 
identify the truck -- a red pickup with a unique rack of amber lights on the 
cab. Avdeef introduced evidence that Valadez owned a truck like the one 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Valadez was identified by one of the three young women as the driver; Figueroa 
by two of them as a passenger in the cab. All of them identified Menchaca as 
one of the two shooters riding in the back of the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
But the three defense lawyers hammered away at inconsistencies in the women's 
versions about what happened, calling them all liars. One lawyer argued that 
the three women only assumed it was Valadez and his two friends because they 
thought they recognized the truck. 
</P>
<P>
One of the young women said she saw Figueroa before the shooting began, then 
later said it was afterward, when the truck had passed. Figueroa's attorney, 
Julian W. Bailey, argued to the jurors Monday that "Superman couldn't have 
identified anybody in that truck" because the cab's back glass was black. All 
the defense lawyers argued it was too dark and the witnesses were all too busy 
dodging a hail of bullets for them to see anything. 
</P>
<P>
Valadez's attorney, David Zimmerman, argued that it was nonsense to believe 
Valadez would have used his own truck, with its unique front, if he were going 
to be involved in the shooting. Zimmerman asked his client to stand up. 
</P>
<P>
"Does Louis look naive? Does Louis look dumb to you?" Zimmerman asked the 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour ordered two juries to hear the trial -- a 
unique situation in Orange County, but already done elsewhere in California -- 
because of a last-minute decision to include Menchaca as a defendant. He was 
about to be granted a separate trial because his attorney, C. Thomas McDonald, 
had a scheduling conflict. When that was resolved, Seymour ordered a second 
jury to hear the trial and decide only on Menchaca's case. 
</P>
<P>
The two juries sat in on the trial together until the end. A split in strategy 
between McDonald and the other two defense attorneys led the Menchaca jury to 
hear evidence the other lawyers didn't want their jury to hear. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald boldly announced to jurors he would name the real killers, and put on 
evidence to show that a nephew of Valadez's and two of his friends had 
Valadez's truck that night. Valadez's attorney didn't want his jurors to hear 
that because that would be a tacit admission that his client's truck was indeed 
involved in the shooting.

TEAM TENNIS: UC IRVINE GRADUATE LOSES TWO OF HIS THREE SETS, AND NEWPORT BEACH 
DEFEATS CHARLOTTE HEAT, 29-17.

<TEXT>
<P>
Before the Charlotte Heat's Team Tennis match with the Newport Beach Dukes, 
Trevor Kronemann was excited about returning to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Dukes defeated the Heat, 29-17, and Kronemann, a four-time 
All-American at UC Irvine, lost two of his three sets, he was upset with more 
than just his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann had vocal supporters among the 578 people who watched the match at 
John Wayne Tennis Club Tuesday night, but he was upset that hecklers hounded 
him during his singles match. 
</P>
<P>
"Little kids down here were saying, 'choke, choke, choke,' " Kronemann said. "I 
come here and that's the greeting I get? It's unbelievable. It's just not 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) it's partly my fault because I let them get to me and that's the first 
time that's happened all year." 
</P>
<P>
The victory put the Dukes (7-4) into a tie for last place in the West Division 
with the Sacramento Capitals, who lost to the Los Angeles Strings Tuesday. The 
San Antonio Racquets, who play the Dukes Thursday in Newport Beach, are a 
half-match ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann, who graduated from UC Irvine this spring, is in his first summer of 
professional tennis. He was in Kansas playing in a month-long USTA event when 
the Heat asked him to replace injured Mark Dickson before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
He accepted and has become the Heat's top men's player, competing in singles, 
mixed and men's doubles. 
</P>
<P>
In mixed doubles, teaming with Ronni Reis, Kronemann showed the power of his 
fiery demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't make Trevor mad, because all of a sudden you start unleasing that 
nuclear power plant in him," said Dukes Coach Greg Patton, who coached 
Kronemann at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Sophie Amiach didn't anger Kronemann in the mixed doubles set Tuesday but she 
bore the brunt of his reaction to a line call. 
</P>
<P>
During the seventh game of the set, which was tied, 3-3, Kronemann disputed a 
line call that gave the Dukes a 40-30 lead. Amiach went to the net on the next 
point and paid for it. Kronemann hit two big forehands at her. The first she 
managed to return to Kronemann; the second knocked the racket from her hand. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dukes won the next point to take the game, Kronemann and Reis won 
the set, 6-5, when Kronemann won the final two points of the tie breaker -- one 
with an ace; the other with a service winner. 
</P>
<P>
In men's singles, the Dukes' Roger Smith cooled off Kronemann, 6-3, as 
Kronemann lost his final two serves. 
</P>
<P>
In the final set of the match, Marty Davis and Smith defeated Kronemann and 
Paul Koscielski, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes' women opened the match with two victories, which gave Newport Beach 
a 12-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier and Amiach took a 3-0 lead against Reis and Donna Faber, but the Heat 
closed the deficit to 4-3 when Frazier lost her serve. The Dukes then broke 
Faber's serve and Amiach won her serve and the set, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier then extended the Dukes' lead with a 6-1 victory in women's singles.

UCI NAMES COACH FOR WOMEN'S SOCCER

FUNDAMERICA FAITHFUL CHEER 'RESURRECTION';

Thousands of Fund-America members poured into a hotel here Tuesday night for 
what author and economic forecaster Howard Ruff called the "rebirth and the 
resurrection" of the controversial company that was raided by security 
regulators two weeks ago for allegedly being a pyramid scheme. 
</P>
<P>
In his nearly two-hour presentation, Ruff, who replaced Robert T. Edwards as 
president and CEO on Monday, said that he had not ruled out taking the company 
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, though he felt confident 
he could restore the firm and had plans to actually take it public in the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way I'm going to become sincerely rich," said Ruff, who disclosed 
that he has cancer. ". . . The company isn't dead; it's just in a coma." 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd decided to take over the company because "I had an obligation to 
protect my friends." Some 1,500 subscribers to Ruff's financial newsletter, the 
Ruff Times, have joined FundAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was enthusiastic about Ruff's speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very positive," said Mark Guest, a 25-year-old FundAmerica member from 
Monarch Beach, who says he has made a six-figure income with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff was greeted with a standing ovation and whistles. His circus barker-type 
presentation was transmitted via telephone lines to 15,000 FundAmerica members 
in eight states. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff told all members they were not permitted to talk to the media under any 
circumstances or they would lose their membership. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards -- who founded the company in 1986 -- was arrested July 19 by Florida 
authorities on charges he was running an illegal pyramid scheme. If he is 
convicted, he could face more than 30 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Released on a $1-million bond, Edwards has disputed the charges. He did not 
attend Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff disclosed that the company's cash crunch is even more severe than 
previously thought. First Interstate Bank, which FundAmerica entrusted with $11 
million in deposits, has seized those funds and is refusing to release them, 
according to Ruff. He called on members to register their outrage with the bank 
and said he would not hesitate to sue. "You cannot ambush us and not pay a 
price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though money is tight, Ruff said, the company will refund dues to any 
members who joined after May 15, if they want out of the company. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica released a statement earlier this week saying that Ruff and some of 
his associates intended to inject capital into the beleaguered company. 
However, on Tuesday, Ruff declined to reveal the identities of his 
"influential, wealthy friends" who were going to invest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
He did announce his intention to overhaul the company's sales force, tightening 
up some of its practices to ensure that they comply with state laws. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff is best known for predicting a period of economic distress in the 1980s, 
which turned out to be a prosperous period. He authored the 1978 bestseller 
"How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years " as well as "Famine and Survival 
in America." 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica -- which does business in eight states -- is under investigation in 
at least three of them. 
</P>
<P>
Florida officials charge the company has no real product and exists solely as a 
pyramid scheme, using membership dues from new investors to pay bonuses to 
existing ones. The company has vehemently denied the charge, saying its 
principal business is obtaining cash rebates for its members. Because it has so 
many members -- about 100,000 -- the company says it can get major discounts by 
buying in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
The entire rebate system is rigged -- according to regulators -- because 
FundAmerica subsidizes the rebates offered by companies such as Citibank with 
the money of new investors. Once the company failed to attract new investors, 
it would have collapsed, according to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a federal judge in San Francisco modified a total freeze on 
FundAmerica's assets, which was made following the filing of a class-action 
lawsuit against the company seeking more than $150 million in damages on behalf 
of its members. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel decided Tuesday that FundAmerica could spend 
more than $1 million of $17 million in several bank accounts so it could meet 
payroll and severance obligations. 
</P>
<P>
But Patel refused a request by the company to pay some $5 million in 
commissions to its sales representatives. She did say, however, that it could 
pay each representative up to $3,000 in commissions. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica charges $140 for a basic membership but pays bonuses to members 
recruiting new blood. Bringing in new people is the principal way people 
achieved overnight success through the company.

Rudolf J. Hanley had little trouble telling visiting Hungarian businessmen all 
about credit unions during their recent four-country tour. 
</P>
<P>
Hanley, president of the Orange County Teachers Federal Credit Union in Santa 
Ana, was born in Budapest and spoke in his native tongue as he told Hungarians 
about Western-style credit union services, operations and management. 
</P>
<P>
Hanley stayed with the group for three days of their nine-day visit, sponsored 
by the World Council of Credit Unions in Madison, Wis. The World Council 
represents credit unions in 80 countries. 
</P>
<P>
With the Communists ousted from the seat of power, Hungarians are reforming 
their economic system, and one of the financial institutions they might want to 
copy from the West is the credit union.

GOOD NEWS IS 14 S&amp;LS EXCEED CAPITAL LEVELS REQUIRED BY LATE '94 
</P>

One of the brighter notes in the dismal first-quarter earnings of Orange County 
savings and loans is that 14 of the still solvent, independently owned thrifts 
exceed all three levels of capital that the federal government will require of 
thrifts by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to recently released figures by thrift regulators, three 
others meet current requirements, which gradually increase to the fully 
phased-in levels in four years. 
</P>
<P>
For a capital-starved industry, that's good news. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators and legislators want S&amp;L owners to put more of their money at 
risk, figuring that owners won't be so reckless in investing other people's 
money if they they stand to lose their own. Capital is nothing more than what 
the owners put in to start and grow a business and what they rely on to absorb 
unforeseen losses. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 17 county S&amp;Ls that meet current or future requirements, four 
other thrifts failed only one test at the end of the first quarter. Guardian 
Savings in Huntington Beach failed two of the tests, and FarWest Savings in 
Newport Beach failed all three. Both are still solvent, however. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 23 solvent thrifts, seven failed thrifts and a special 
thrift set up by regulators to liquidate the bad assets from the old American 
Savings &amp; Loan called Orange County home at the end of March.

EECO SELLS OFF ITS MAXI-SWITCH DIVISION 
</P>

EECO Inc., the computer parts maker that filed for bankruptcy protection in 
May, said Tuesday it has sold the assets of its Maxi-Switch Keyboard Division 
to a Taiwanese electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
EECO said in a statement it sold the Tucson-based division to Silitek, 
exclusive of any liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Silitek will retain EECO's 100 employees in Tucson, where Taipei-based Silitek 
will establish its U.S. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
David Lin, president and chief executive officer of Silitek, said in a 
statement that the acquisition will advance the company's goal of becoming a 
worldwide supplier of computer input devices. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, EECO sold its keyboard plant in Caborca, Mexico, for an 
undisclosed sum to an investor group led by the plant's former management team. 
</P>
<P>
EECO also expects to sell its hotel computer systems business in Santa Ana in 
the coming months. The company retains its keyboard and switch manufacturing 
business in Scotland, and a keypad manufacturing plant in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
George B. DeHuff III, president and chief executive of EECO, said the company 
would use the proceeds of the sales to pay debt. 
</P>
<P>
After defaulting on a $10-million line of credit to Sanwa Bank in Los Angeles, 
EECO filed for bankruptcy protection on May 2. Before the filing, EECO 
officials said the company suffered losses because of heavy competition from 
the Far East as well as delays in its attempt to sell the Maxi-Switch division. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, EECO lost $10.3 million on revenue of $63 million.

Under The Stars 
</P>
<P>
The Grove Shakespeare Festival hosted a party and poetry reading at the 
Festival's Garden Grove amphitheater on Monday, raising an estimated $20,000 
through ticket sales and donations, according to managing director Barbara 
Hammerman. About 185 people paid $125 each for cocktails and a gourmet dinner 
served in a courtyard across from the theater, then moved across the park at 
dusk to hear selections from the Bard's rhymes and rages. An additional 220 
guests bought $50 tickets for the performance, dubbed "A Midsummer Night's Eve 
at the Grove." 
</P>
<P>
The Star 
</P>
<P>
Among the six actors who mingled with guests at dinner and then shared the 
starlit stage was local-girl-done-good Kelly McGillis, a Juilliard-trained 
actress as well as an above-the-title movie star. McGillis stuck by her 
husband, Fred Tillman, and Thomas F. Bradac, Grove's producing artistic 
director, for most of the party -- at least until she was called up to a podium 
to address the clearly smitten guests. She kept it brief. "I believe in the 
classics, and I believe in language," she said, praising the theater for giving 
"young people a chance to be exposed to Shakespeare." She called Bradac, who 
was her drama teacher at Newport Harbor High school, "the reason I became an 
actress -- much to my parents' dismay." And she said she hoped she'd be able to 
do a play at the Grove (that worked like an applause sign on her rapt 
audience). After a minute or two with all eyes on her, McGillis smiled and said 
she had to go get ready for the show. "I don't have much to do," she added, 
laughing, "but stop shaking." The other performers -- all of whom have acted in 
Grove productions -- were uniform in their praise of McGillis. "She's just been 
a real pleasure to work with," said actress Kamella Tate, who dined with her 
parents, Tom and Donna Tate, and date Paul Yeuell. "This isn't some movie 
person saying, 'Hey, I think I'll try this,"' said actor Daniel Bryan Cartmell. 
"She's a real Shakespearean actress. She knows what she's doing up there." Also 
taking part in the reading were John Frederick Jones, Gregory Itzin and Carl 
Reggiardo. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
While musicians played period pieces and Elizabethan-garbed merrymakers 
strolled the courtyard, guests lined up for buffet helpings of prime rib, 
shrimp scampi, pasta with pesto, marinara and clam sauces, Ceasar salad, fresh 
fruit and desserts. Among those alfresco-ing were proud papa Don McGillis, Leo 
and Virginia Zlaket, Donna Connelly, Kathryn and Paul McKee, Jean and Phil 
Darling, Jeanne Delp and Jeanette Justice, president of the theater's board of 
trustees. The party was chaired by David Krebs, whose committee included Greg 
Devereaux, Patricia Negrino, Jane Oglesby, Joan Peters, Alicia Dorman, Joe 
Bernhardt, Tom Moon, Carol Hoffman and Billur Wallerich. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief, thickly accented speech from the podium, French artist Jean Pol d. 
Franqueuil recounted how, when he decided to make a painting to donate to the 
party, he didn't know anything about Shakespeare "except what you learn in 
school." But he wanted to take part, so he went to the library and spend hours 
poring over texts and illustrations. "Now," Franqueuil said, "old William and I 
-- we are good buddies." PAMELA MARIN

Affiliations clarified -- Because of mistakes in biographical material supplied 
by KNBC Channel 4, articles in Calendar last Saturday and Monday incorrectly 
stated Dr. Bruce Hensel's affiliations with UCLA and Century City Hospital. 
Rather than a tenured professor, Hensel is an assistant clinical professor at 
the UCLA School of Medicine, an unpaid position that allows him participation 
in some areas of the teaching process. 
</P>
<P>
Hensel serves as co-director of the Century City Hospital Emergency Department, 
sharing the responsibility for overseeing the emergency ward on a part-time 
basis with two other doctors. A KNBC spokeswoman blamed the errors on the 
station's public relations department, which wrote Hensel's three-page 
biography. She said that Hensel, who has served as a medical reporter at 
Channel 4 since 1987, was hired by the station before he secured either the 
UCLA or Century City affiliations.

MINOR COMMISSION TAKES ON MAJOR ROLE AS NEA PEACEMAKER; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS GRANTS: THE PANEL MAY PROVIDE POLITICIANS WITH A REPORT THAT HAS THE LOOK

An obscure commission set up by Congress in October and given six months to 
evaluate the National Endowment for the Arts and its grant-making procedures is 
emerging as a key force in resolving the controversy over the federal arts 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
When the NEA's renewal seemed possible by the end of July, the 12-member 
Independent Commission appeared destined to become an irrelevant footnote to 
the whole controversy. 
</P>
<P>
But when attempts to reauthorize the NEA ground to a halt last week as a House 
floor vote on the matter was put off until September, the commission re-emerged 
as a means to provide valuable cover to politicians by delivering a report that 
is intended to have the appearance of bipartisan objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe not within the last week, but certainly within the last three weeks, the 
role of the commission has completely changed," said Anne Murphy, executive 
director of the American Arts Alliance and an influential arts policy observer 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is chaired by John Brademas, a former Democratic congressman and 
now New York University president, and Leonard Garment, a Washington lawyer and 
influential Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Delays in nominating and confirming the commission's members -- including one 
nominee proposed by President Bush but who reportedly failed an FBI background 
check -- kept the commission from being sworn in and beginning its 
investigation until June 6. With a budget of $250,000, the commission has only 
until Sept. 30 to deliver its report. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Wyzomirski, the commission director, said Tuesday the panel intends to 
deliver its report on schedule -- a place in time where the document and its 
recommendations could strongly influence the NEA's 1991 appropriation bill in 
Congress and the pending reauthorization legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalind Wyman, a former Los Angeles city councilwoman and a member of the 
Independent Commission, said Tuesday that the panel hopes to start internal 
debate on its recommendations next week. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the commission heard constitutional lawyers argue that last year's 
congressional attempts to write restrictions on the content of federally 
supported artworks had failed and raised serious questions about the 
preservation of artistic freedom of expression in the process. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorneys largely agreed that Congress can legally exert significant 
influence over the NEA's artistic choices -- for instance, by instructing the 
agency in legislation to pay more attention to visual arts and less to music. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kathleen Sullivan, a Harvard Law School professor and First Amendment 
authority, said that discrimination in NEA legislation against any specific 
artistic viewpoint -- which would be embodied in prohibitions on "homoerotic," 
"blasphemous" or "offensive" art -- would clearly run afoul of the 
Constitution, no matter how carefully they were written. 
</P>
<P>
"The very worst kind of restriction is viewpoint discrimination," Sullivan 
said. "There can be no hit lists of disfavored ideas in art." 
</P>
<P>
Michael McConnell, a University of Chicago Law School expert, suggested that a 
number of constitutionally acceptable reforms are possible at the NEA, 
including a provision under which panels of arts experts who make initial grant 
recommendations would offer NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer and the National 
Council on the Arts more choices than grants available. That would permit the 
council, which advises Frohnmayer on arts policy, and the chairman to make the 
final cut -- by standards different from strict tenets of artistic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Appearances by Sullivan and five other attorneys Tuesday also saw evidence of 
sharp ideological divisions on the Independent Commission. 
</P>
<P>
After the first panel of three lawyers had been seated for more than 90 
minutes, commission member David Connor, a Peoria, Ill., businessman and museum 
trustee, angrily told the lawyers their presentations were irrelevant: "The 
issue is what kind of restrictions (on the NEA) the political body can live 
with, not what lawyers can live with." 
</P>
<P>
The remark prompted a rebuke by Garment, who apologized for Connor's outburst, 
to applause by most of the other commission members. The commission has also 
heard persistently skeptical conservative questioning by John Agresto, 
president of St. John's College in Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Presentations by two panels of constitutional scholars came a day after 
Frohnmayer spent most of a morning with the Independent Commission. Also on 
Monday, Frohnmayer's predecessor at the endowment, Frank Hodsoll, met with the 
commission in private for more than an hour -- the first time Hodsoll, now an 
official at the Office of Management and Budget, has taken a direct role in the 
public NEA debate. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer suggested that different "standards" may govern what art is 
acceptable for public and private funding. As an example, he cited a photograph 
of Holocaust victims, which, he contended, "might be inappropriate for display 
in the entrance of a museum where all would have to confront it." 
</P>
<P>
"The NEA does, and in my view, should consider standards other than substantial 
artistic and cultural significance and the maintenance and encouragement of 
professional excellence," Frohnmayer said.

PICKING UP THE PIECES; 
</P>
<P>
UN-CANCELLATION SENDS 'LOVE'S' PRODUCERS SCRAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
"Anything but Love" got a happy surprise when ABC, after canceling the comedy 
May 21, decided a month later not to cancel and ordered nine new episodes as a 
backup series for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The only catch: Some staffers had already signed contracts to work on other 
shows. They were anything but pleased that ABC's delayed renewal canceled their 
chance to return to the series about workers at a Chicago magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited as long as we could. We were told it was dead, so we took other 
jobs," said Bruce Rasmussen, former co-producer of "Anything but Love." "This 
is not to say we're not happy where we are, but our first choice would have 
been to stay on the show we were on last year." 
</P>
<P>
Although ABC made its decision in time to keep stars Jamie Lee Curtis and 
Richard Lewis on board -- as well as executive producers Peter Noah and Robert 
Myman and co-executive producer Janis Hirsch -- Rasmussen and executive story 
consultants Michael Saltzman and Bill Diamond had already departed to join the 
staff of NBC's "Wings," and co-producer Alan Kirschenbaum had become 
co-executive producer of ABC's "Baby Talk." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Noah said that because "Anything but Love" was not renewed when 
other series were, it lost its chance to compete for the services of many 
established comedy writers, who are routinely snapped up by other shows as soon 
as the networks announce their fall schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little aggravating," Noah said when the renewal finally came. "Not only 
did we have a terrific staff, but 'Anything but Love' is a show that a lot of 
writers like. This is frustrating, I'll have to admit that. But when the dust 
settles, we're going to have terrific writers. To a certain extent, you are 
really at the mercy of the whims of the network, but we are really grateful to 
be given another chance." 
</P>
<P>
Since that conversation, the show has hired one new writer, Bill Bryan, who 
will join Bill Barol, a writer who signed on with "Anything but Love" at 
mid-season last year. Noah said that the production company may make a deal to 
add a creative consultant, but he considers the show fully staffed now. 
</P>
<P>
From his post at "Baby Talk," Kirschenbaum said that, while he is "a little 
sad" about not being part of "Anything but Love," he is "ecstatic that the show 
is picked up" and does not expect the loss of a few writers to change the show 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"Shows do go on," he said. "Peter (Noah) is enormously talented; the only three 
irreplaceable people on the show are Peter, Richard Lewis and Jamie Lee. People 
change shows in this business; it's very rare that somebody stays on a show for 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Harris Katleman, president and chief executive officer of Twentieth Television, 
which produces the series in association with Adam Productions (a partnership 
of Myman and John Ritter), said that he and Myman went to ABC to plead the 
show's case as soon as it was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The studio also sent memos to everyone "from (ABC chairman and chief executive 
Thomas) Murphy on down to the person who opens the door," Katleman said. The 
plea included copies of an indignant column by New York Newsday columnist 
Marvin Kitman, blasting ABC for canceling the "unique, innovative comedy." 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude was: I thought they (ABC) had made a major error and I just kept 
hammering at them," Katleman said. "I told them, 'You're going to need this 
show desperately,' and they concurred." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Harbert, ABC's executive vice president for prime time, denied that ABC 
needed the show "desperately." He added that ABC's initial decision to cancel 
was anything but a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"With the information we had on May 21, it was a reasonable decision," he said. 
"We had to give them a decision by then; they got their decision. We were torn 
about it; it came down to the very last second. It came down to, OK, 51 
(percent) against. If we had another day, it might just as easily have gone 51 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Though declining to offer specifics, Harbert said that ABC executives changed 
their minds because, after setting the fall lineup, they found that they didn't 
have enough backup shows immediately available to go into production. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned about the availability dates of some of our backup shows 
created a sort of window of opportunity for 'Anything but Love' to pop back in 
there," he said. While acknowledging that Kitman's "second coming of Christ" 
review -- as well as Myman and Katleman -- carried some pull, "If we hadn't 
been able to come up with that window of opportunity, all the good salesmanship 
in the world wouldn't have had much effect." 
</P>
<P>
The network has asked the producers to be ready to go back on the air in 
October, but "if nothing (on the fall schedule) fails, 'Anything but Love' will 
not get on the air until next March," Harbert said. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th-hour rescue represents another chapter in "Anything but Love's" quirky 
history. When it went on the air in March, 1989, it already had undergone an 
overhaul from the oiginal pilot. Hannah (Curtis) landed a job at Chicago Weekly 
Magazine, where she was helped by star reporter Marty Gold (Lewis). For the 
rest of the season, Hannah struggled as a researcher, shared a woodsy cabin 
with her father and developed her friendship with Marty. 
</P>
<P>
When the show returned last fall, Hannah had a better job at the magazine, a 
tough new boss (played by Ann Magnuson) and her own apartment. The friendship 
with Marty continued. (Summer reruns of last season's episodes air Wednesdays 
at 9:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Now more changes are in store. Bruce Weitz ("Hill Street Blues") will join the 
staff of the magazine next season, and John Ritter will play a photographer 
with designs on Hannah in the first few episodes. More importantly, the 
Hannah-Marty relationship will finally take a romantic turn. 
</P>
<P>
According to Harbert, test audiences have not warmed to their platonic 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the idea of these male-and-female friendships makes people 
uncomfortable," he said. "They don't really get it -- either you're lovers, or 
you're not. That's not true in life, but in a television show, the audience 
wants to know."

RADIO DEMOGRAPHICS: WHY NO. 2 IS NO. 1; 
</P>
<P>
RATINGS: KIIS-FM MAY HAVE FINISHED RUNNER-UP TO KOST-FM IN THE ARBITRON 
RANKINGS, BUT ENDED UP FIRST WITH THE PRIZED 18- TO 34-YEAR-OLD TARGET 
AUDIENCE. 
</P>

<P>
No. 2 is actually No. 1, and No. 1 is really No. 3. Move No. 3 to No. 4, take 
No. 4 off the Top 12, and bring up No. 5 to the No. 2 spot. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? 
</P>
<P>
Those are part of the maneuvers radio executives and advertisers go through 
every three months to determine the real meaning behind the Arbitron ratings. 
When it comes down to programming and advertising revenue, it's the 
demographics that really count, and who is listening to a particular station 
becomes as significant as how many are listening. 
</P>
<P>
That's why executives at Top 40 station KIIS-FM (102.7) were celebrating when 
the latest Arbitrons were released last month. Even though KIIS ranked No. 2 
behind "soft hits" KOST-FM (103.5) in terms of total audience, it was No. 1 
with people between the ages of 18 and 34, one of the most sought-after 
demographic groups for radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
KOST-FM was No. 3 with that age group, behind KIIS and rock station KLOS-FM 
(95.5). KLOS ranked No. 5 in the main Arbitron ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Coming in at No. 4 with 18- to 34-year-olds was "dance music" station KPWR-FM 
(105.9), which was ranked No. 2 among listeners 12 years old and older. KPWR 
had been No. 1 with the 18-34 group last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The drop that we experienced is reflective of how much No. 1 can go back and 
forth," said Duncan Payton, KPWR's promotion director. "I think it's because 
there's so much competition for that age group." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Anderson, president and general manager of KIIS, said that KIIS has been 
No. 1 with the 18-34 group for most of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a demographic that is almost impossible to reach except for radio," she 
said. "Television has a very difficult time reaching this audience. It's an 
active audience, so they're mobile." 
</P>
<P>
It's this mobility that makes them so attractive to advertisers, Anderson 
added. "Since they're moving more, they have to buy more," she said. "Whether 
they're in school or out of school, their buying needs are great." 
</P>
<P>
Carey Curelop, program director for KLOS-FM, said, "Years ago, all the stations 
wanted teens to listen to them, and all you heard were commercials about bubble 
gum and cereal. Now those teens have grown up, and no one wants a teen audience 
anymore. They want baby boomers, who need everything -- furniture, washing 
machines, cars." 
</P>
<P>
The 18-34 audience is on the low end of the 25-54 age group that advertisers 
feel is the most important. Many radio stations feel it's easier to target the 
lower age groups because the 25-54 audience is too broad. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising dollars for the 18-34 audience could account for about 20% of a 
station's revenue, Anderson said. But more importantly, if a station is 
successful in attracting those people, chances are good that it also will 
attract listeners on either side of that age spectrum. The combined audience 
could increase that revenue to 60%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"18-34 is really the core demographic for everything else," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Because several stations are competing for the key 18-34 audience, the 
individual ratings for the stations have declined, some station officials said. 
That has enabled "soft-hits" KOST-FM to top the overall local Arbitron ratings 
for the last two quarters, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken each other down," said Jeff Wyatt, vice president of programming 
for KPWR. "Because of that, KOST-FM has popped to the top of the Arbitrons. 
They play yesterday's hits, but the station has profited because everyone else 
is engaged in the battle of the contemporary hits." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Neal, general manager of KOST-FM, said that his station mainly targets 
listeners of 25 years old or older. 
</P>
<P>
Other stations use various strategies to get at the key demographic. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it's really important to find out what's happening in the streets and 
in the clubs," Wyatt said. "Our personalities are very concerned about their 
lifestyle. We particularly are interested in what female tastes are, and we 
target our approach to what 18-34 females find interesting. That can range from 
the abortion issue to who's on Mr. Blackwell's worst-dressed list." 
</P>
<P>
KIIS' Anderson said that her station does a lot of research into the wants and 
needs of 18- to 34-year-olds. "We really listen to our audience, and we make 
sure everything that comes out of our station is lifestyle-driven," she said. 
"We have high-profile promotions that have to fit their lifestyles. We give 
away Porsches or vacations to Puerto Vallarta. We have remote broadcasts from 
the site of the Grammys, or the hottest club." 
</P>
<P>
But according to Bill Summers, president and general manager of KLOS, it all 
comes down to the basics: the music. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always been dominant in the male demographic between 18-34, and I'm sure 
the music is a key," Summers said. "It's also the personalities like (morning 
drivetime deejays) Mark and Brian. The baby boomers grew up with us and they 
really enjoy us. We're always in the top three when it comes to that, and the 
difference between the top three is not that great."

ARTS COUNCIL MEETING OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

The National Endowment for the Arts said Tuesday that a series of meetings 
Friday through Sunday of its 24-member advisory board would be open to the 
public as a result of a court suit filed by four news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement that the meeting of the National Council on the Arts would be 
open for the first time in its 25-year history was made by NEA Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer said that the decision was made after a suit was filed Monday 
morning in U.S. District Court here by the Los Angeles Times, the Washington 
Post, the Philadelphia Inquirer and the New York Times seeking access to the 
meeting at which controversial grant applications are expected to be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is highly unusual for any agency of the federal government to conduct 
application review in the glare of public scrutiny," Frohnmayer said. "But I am 
convinced that there are significant advantages to having our citizens aware of 
how this small amount of their money is invested in cultural activities all 
Americans enjoy." ALLAN PARACHINI

Muslim militants surrendered today and began freeing their 40 hostages, ending 
a six-day coup attempt that seriously threatened the government and reportedly 
left at least 20 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
Hostages started leaving the government television station at midday and 
boarding an army bus after being searched by soldiers, state radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The live broadcast said 14 of the 25 hostages in the building had been freed by 
2:05 p.m. Many appeared haggard after their long ordeal. The heavily armed 
rebels remained inside while the evacuation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
The other rebels and hostages, who included government ministers, awaited 
evacuation from the Parliament building about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Gregory Shaw, said the militants, who began their coup attempt 
Friday, had agreed to free all their captives. 
</P>
<P>
"The process is beginning," Shaw said. "It's going to be slow." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was his understanding that the coup leader, Yasin abu Bakr, and his 
group of 100 Muslim extremists had surrendered unconditionally. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages initially included the prime minister, Arthur N. R. Robinson, but 
he was freed on Tuesday after offering to step down, call new elections and 
grant the rebels amnesty. It was not immediately clear whether the government 
would fulfill that pledge since it was made while Robinson was held captive. 
</P>
<P>
Details of how the rebel surrender came about were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Abu Bakr had described the coup attempt as a "small family 
squabble" and said that an accord had been reached to end the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. from the Caribbean 
nation, Abu Bakr had indicated that the hostages would be freed soon.

2 NORTHRIDGE TEENS ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF PACOIMA PASTOR

Two teen-agers were in jail this morning after their arrests in the shooting 
death of a Pacoima pastor who police said was gunned down in his Chatsworth 
home during a dispute over a minor traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Dana L. Singer, 18, and Philip J. Dimenno, 19, both of 
Northridge, were arrested on suspicion of murder Tuesday afternoon, two days 
after the body of Carl White, 54, was found on the floor of his home in the 
20100 block of Citronia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
White was pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church, a storefront church on Van 
Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima with a handful of members. White was also a house 
painter and a driver for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Michael Brandt said investigators found recent damage to the rear of 
White's car and learned from other evidence that he had been in a minor 
accident Friday night. Further investigation of the accident led to the 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all based on a minor traffic accident," Brandt said. "There is absolutely 
no rhyme or reason to it."

A pregnant Long Beach woman was killed by gang gunfire early today, but 
surgeons delivered her premature baby by emergency Cesarean section before she 
died early today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kentzie Pope, 31, was hit in the back by a shotgun blast fired from a passing 
car as she stood in front of an apartment building about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Pope and several gang members were standing in front of the building, a known 
hangout for gang members, as the car passed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics took Pope, who was eight months pregnant, to St. Mary Medical 
Center, where doctors delivered a premature baby girl by Cesarean section 
during emergency surgery, hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Cohen said. The baby 
weighed just over 4 pounds and is in critical condition, she said.

FLORIDA TO SET FREE AILING 'MERCY KILLER'

Florida officials signed clemency orders today for an 81-year-old man convicted 
of shooting his ailing wife in what he said was a mercy killing. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bob Martinez and three Cabinet members signed the order for health reasons 
with the conditions that Roswell Gilbert keep contact with probation officers 
and not possess any weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert could be released from prison as early as Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"A just society is one that tempers the need for punishment with the compassion 
that is our hallmark as a people," said Martinez, who three years ago rejected 
Gilbert's clemency request. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gilbert's declining health, and the likelihood that his condition will 
continue to deteriorate if he remains in prison, leads me to the conclusion 
that he should be granted clemency," Martinez said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert is serving a minimum mandatory sentence of life without chance of 
parole for 25 years for killing his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease 
and osteoporosis. He was the subject of a 1987 television movie that dramatized 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"O Lord, it's just such wonderful news," said Gilbert's daughter, Martha Moran, 
in Baltimore. "It's just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Dad last Thursday," she said. "He was doing OK considering the 
circumstances. I know he will be absolutely thrilled to death at getting out, 
of course." 
</P>
<P>
Moran said she will return to Florida immediately to help her father resettle. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the readjustment to life outside the prison won't be too difficult for 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was examined in January, and a medical report by Dr. Irene Cody showed 
that he suffered from heart and lung disease and was considered "at high risk 
of death at any time" because of his age and physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claimed that Gilbert, a retired engineer, killed his 
72-year-old wife, Emily, in March, 1985, after 51 years of marriage because she 
had become a burden to him.

SOVIET UNION: A COMMITTEE FORMED WITH YELTSIN SIGNALS THE LEADER'S WILLINGNESS 
TO MOVE FASTER TOWARD MARKET REFORMS.

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his main political rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, 
have formed a joint committee to revamp the Soviet economy, a sign that 
Gorbachev is willing to move faster toward market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member committee, which held its first meeting today, brought together 
moderate reformers loyal to Gorbachev and more radical reformers supporting 
Yeltsin, the president of the huge Russian republic who recently quit 
Gorbachev's Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat termed the move "rather important" because the national 
government was in danger of falling far behind economic changes introduced in 
Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't do something like this, they are going to be left behind," the 
diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Russia is going to move 
ahead fast." 
</P>
<P>
More rapid reform of the Soviet economy could also increase the chances for 
obtaining Western aid, which Gorbachev says is necessary to reform the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's top economic adviser, Nikolai Y. Petrakov, said in an interview 
that the decision to form the committee was "the most important information of 
1990" in Soviet domestic politics. He said Gorbachev and Yeltsin signed the 
agreement Saturday after several days of talks. 
</P>
<P>
The economists appointed to it will develop a common economic policy for the 
nation. Petrakov said it is too early to say what they might recommend, but 
their work should be done by Sept. 1 when the national and Russian parliaments 
reconvene. Economic reforms will be of top priority at the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The committee includes such proponents of reform as Petrakov, Deputy Premier 
Leonid A. Abalkin, Presidential Council member Stanislav Shatalin, economist 
and writer Nikolai Shmelev, Yeltsin deputy Grigory Yavlinsky and Russian 
Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov. 
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news service identified Yavlinsky as the author of Yeltsin's "500 
Days" economic program to move Russia to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Over Gorbachev's objections, Yeltsin was elected in May to head Russia, which 
contains three-fourths of the Soviet Union's land and more than half its 
people. Since then, he has slowly outlined plans to overhaul the republic's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
He has shown tolerance toward private property and in recent weeks indicated he 
intends to radically reform land ownership and seize control of banking. That 
brought a sharp response from Gorbachev, who on Sunday urged Soviet republics 
not to try to break away from the central money and banking system. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his premier, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, have moved more slowly on the 
economy and are facing sharp criticism for its failures. Yeltsin and other 
reformers have urged Ryzhkov to resign. Yeltsin also quit the Communist Party 
last month, starting an exodus of leading reformers.

SENATE VOTES TO BAN FEES FOR SPEECHES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ACCEPTING MONEY FOR OUTSIDE SPEAKING REDUCES LAWMAKERS TO 'THE LEVEL 
OF USED-CAR SALESMEN,' ONE SENATOR SAYS.

<P>
The Senate voted today to ban outside speaking fees, a custom Sen. Robert C. 
Byrd said puts lawmakers "at the level of used-car salesmen" in the public's 
esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-23 vote on an amendment by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) attached 
the honorarium ban to a campaign finance reform bill. The ban would take effect 
next January. Senators are now allowed to accept up to $27,337 a year in 
honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
"When a significant part of our salaries comes from hustling, and that's what 
it amounts to, we denigrate ourselves," Dodd said. "As public servants, our 
salaries should come from the public alone." 
</P>
<P>
The House voted last year to give up honorariums effective Jan. 1, 1991, but 
also boosted the salaries of its members from $98,400 to $124,000 then. 
Reluctant to vote themselves a 25% pay boost, the Senate had skirted the 
honorarium issue up until today. 
</P>
<P>
"The scandals of the past two years have put a black mark on public service and 
raised public cynicism to an all-time high," Byrd said, citing $9 million in 
honorariums senators have accepted over the last decade. "We're about at the 
level of used-car salesmen" in the public's esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd's amendment won the support of 53 of the Senate's 55 Democrats and 24 of 
it 45 Republicans. Both California senators voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, senators accepted nearly $3 million in honorariums and kept more than 
$2.1 million, with the balance donated to charity, according to their financial 
disclosure forms. Dodd, the sponsor of the ban, reported accepting $15,000 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, one of the largest recipients of honorariums, 
said he agreed with Dodd on the need to eliminate senators' honorarium income 
but not on the strategy of doing it without a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
"In January, House members will be getting paid about $22,000 more than 
senators . . . and we could be getting about $22,000 less for years to come," 
he said.

AMERICAN WHO MAILED SELF MARIJUANA FACES DEATH PENALTY IN MALAYSIA TRIAL

Malaysian officials testified today that an American man -- the first to stand 
trial under this nation's strict drug law -- apparently mailed himself a 
package containing marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Malaysian law carries a mandatory death sentence for those convicted of drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Lane Wiley, 38, of Sacramento is being tried on charges he had 16.85 
ounces of marijuana in his possession in November. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, prosecutors do not need to prove a sale occurred to win a 
trafficking conviction; the mere possession of 3.5 ounces or more of marijuana 
or half an ounce of heroin is deemed to constitute trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Malaysian officials testified today that the marijuana was in a package that 
Wiley apparently mailed to himself from Bangkok, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Zainad Daud, a customs officer, told the court that authorities became 
suspicious when they noticed that the sender and the recipient of the package 
were the same person. They inspected it and found the marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley was arrested after signing for the package when it was delivered to him. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials said Wiley, a lecturer in computers at a college in Hawaii, 
entered Malaysia from Bangkok and was staying at a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
Since Parliament allowed the death penalty for drug trafficking in 1975, 340 
people have been sentenced to death. Of these, 112 have been hanged, including 
about 30 foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled to run about three weeks. Drug trafficking suspects do 
not qualify for bail, and Wiley has been confined to Kuala Lumpur's Pudu 
Prison.

Crew members abandoned a Greek cargo ship battered off Cape Cod, Mass., by 
Hurricane Bertha today. At least one seaman died and six were unaccounted for 
as other merchant ships rushed to help, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen crew members were rescued from a lifeboat and a life raft after four 
or more hours in heavy seas. Three were in a lifeboat and one was still in the 
water this morning, Coast Guard Lt. (j.g.) Rodney Gadsden said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet, Hong Kong and Norwegian fishing and merchant ships joined in efforts to 
pluck the sailors from 10- to 15-foot seas. An Air Force communications plane 
was directing their efforts, and a Coast Guard ship was en route. 
</P>
<P>
The 593-foot Greek-registered freighter Corazon, with a crew of 29, lost part 
of its bow and its midsection buckled, Coast Guard Petty Officer Lionel Bryant 
said. The ship was about 340 miles east-southeast of Cape Cod, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members abandoned ship at 4:20 a.m., Coast Guard Petty Officer Anthony L. 
Whitehead said, and by midmorning the Corazon's bow was submerged and its stern 
was standing clear of the water. "You can see the screw," Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
One crew member apparently fell into the water as the crew members boarded the 
lifeboat and life raft, Whitehead said. That seaman was pulled from the water 
by the Soviet trawler Vympel shortly after 7 a.m., but he was dead.

Interferon is the first treatment to relieve and even cure lingering hepatitis 
B infections, the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and one of the 
world's biggest killers, researchers have found. 
</P>
<P>
A study to appear in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine found that 
injections of the natural protein can stop the hepatitis B virus from 
destroying the liver in almost half of the patients who are chronically 
infected. One in 10 is cured. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, there has been no treatment for the hepatitis B virus. While 
interferon clearly does not help everyone, having any therapy at all is 
considered to be an important step in controlling this infection.

BAKER NETS NEW FRIENDS BUT NO FISH IN SIBERIA

Secretary of State James A. Baker III netted new Siberian friends for America 
today with little more than a handshake, but fish from Lake Baikal refused to 
take his bait. 
</P>
<P>
Home advantage was apparent as Baker took to Lake Baikal with his Soviet 
counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in a break from two days of weighty 
superpower talks. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state came home empty-handed. But Shevardnadze landed two, 
restoring Soviet pride lost last year during a similar outing in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, an expert fisherman, took Shevardnadze fishing for trout in Jackson 
Hole, Wyo. The score on that occasion was three fish for the United States and 
none for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the dock, Baker and Shevardnadze plunged into a crowd of about 200 
people who pressed forward to shake hands with Baker and wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Siberia. I love Siberia," Baker told them. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd responded warmly and urged Baker to come back again, prompting 
Shevardnadze to comment that the secretary of state was a better-known 
personality in this part of Russia than most Soviet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze had promised Baker a glimpse of the scenic side of the Soviet 
Union after the Jackson Hole meeting last September. 
</P>
<P>
He did not disappoint, escorting his guest for a 90-minute ride up the Angara 
River to Lake Baikal. 
</P>
<P>
While the ministers and their wives peered out the front of the boat at wooded 
cliffs plunging down to the lake, Shevardnadze's 14-year-old granddaughter 
Sophie was making friends with Baker's aides. 
</P>
<P>
She was soon laughing and giggling with Baker's personal secretary and the two 
ended the trip testing their strength with a bout of arm wrestling -- another 
victory for the Soviet Union.

The European Community, seeking to trim a huge trade deficit with Japan that 
reached $19.8 billion in 1989, today launched a three-year program to boost the 
image of European products in the Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
The project includes a consultancy contract worth more than $5 million for the 
promotion of EC goods in Japan, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Touche Ross and Co. has been awarded the contract, the EC indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The program seeks to develop new sales opportunities in Japan for the 12-nation 
community. EC firms will also be advised on ways to better market their goods 
to Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
An initial image-building campaign will be followed by projects in five 
specific areas -- leisure goods, jewelry, home furniture, measuring equipment 
and health foods.

The government should give special help to workers who lose their jobs because 
of policies on clean air, protecting the spotted owl and cutting defense, 
lawmakers said today. 
</P>
<P>
"As important as it is to reduce defense expenditures and to increase our drive 
to protect the natural environment, it is also important that we make every 
effort not to do so at the expense of American workers and their families," 
said Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland). 
</P>
<P>
Stark, who spoke before the House Ways and Means human resources subcommittee, 
is co-sponsor with Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.) of a proposal to provide cash 
benefits to workers who lose their jobs due to new environmental or military 
spending policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration opposes the legislation, saying that unemployment 
benefits should be the same for everyone.

JUDAS MEMBER ONCE RECORDED HIDDEN MESSAGE

A member of the British rock group Judas Priest told a judge that he once 
recorded a hidden message in one of his songs but not in the album "Stained 
Class," which a lawsuit claims encouraged two young men to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Halford, 39, a member of the heavy metal group, testified Tuesday in Washoe 
District Court that he intentionally placed a hidden message in the song "Love 
Bites," which was recorded about seven years after "Stained Class." 
</P>
<P>
Halford said he had hoped that the message, which can be understood only when 
the record is played backwards, would "enhance its value." 
</P>
<P>
Judas Priest and CBS Records are defendants in a suit filed by the parents of 
Raymond Eugene Belknap, 20, and James Vance, 18, who shot themselves in 1985 
after an afternoon of drinking beer, smoking marijuana and listening to 
"Stained Class." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs, seeking at least $500,000 in damages, contend that the band and 
record company should be held liable for the two young men's deaths. The 
parents say the album contained the subliminal message "do it, do it," which 
prompted the two young men to kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But Halford told Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead, who is hearing the case without a 
jury, that Judas Priest did not put the words "do it, do it" into their 
"Stained Class" album, recorded in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
While on the stand, Halford sang portions of "Better by You, Better Than Me," 
adding that the sound some may believe is "do it" is just his inhaling his 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by plaintiffs' attorney Ken McKenna, Halford admitted 
placing a reversed message in "Love Bites." 
</P>
<P>
He said the phrase "in the dead of the night, love bites" was intentionally 
reversed on the recording. When played forward, the listener can only hear 
garble; but if played backwards, the phrase can be heard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys contend that Belknap and Vance were troubled youths and the 
Judas Priest album was not responsible for their suicides.

MAPPLETHORPE SHOW OPENS IN BOSTON;

ART: THE EXHIBIT HAS STIRRED A NATIONAL DEBATE OVER FEDERAL FUNDING OF WORK 
THAT IS DEEMED OFFENSIVE.

Dozens of supporters and a handful of protesters greeted patrons arriving today 
for the opening of an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs that incensed 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and got a museum director arrested in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of about 150 people, largely made up of those supporting the show, 
was orderly, and no incidents were reported. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200 visitors were lined up outside less than an hour after the 
museum opened its doors, said Denise Spencer, a marketing assistant at the 
Institute for Contemporary Art, which is showing the exhibit. The small museum 
is allowing just 75 people at a time to view the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a public television station that had broadcast the most sexually 
explicit, homoerotic photographs from the so-called "X Portfolio" on its 
newscast Tuesday night said this morning that it got about 100 calls in 
reaction to the newscast, most of them supportive. 
</P>
<P>
Producers of WGBH's 10 p.m. newscast said they aired the "X Portfolio" pictures 
Tuesday to let viewers decide for themselves how they feel about them. 
</P>
<P>
"The coverage thus far never shows you this. All you get is what is in the mind 
of the writer. And we want our coverage to let the viewer decide, with both 
sides presented," said John VanScoyoc, the station's managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
The photos have stirred a national debate over federal funding of work deemed 
offensive. The station, which like other public TV outlets receives federal 
funding, devoted 24 minutes of the half-hour newscast to the exhibit and the 
outcry over its explicit sexual images. 
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts by protesters to have the photos banned, support for the show 
has been strong in Boston, once known as a city of bluenoses for banning books 
and movies. 
</P>
<P>
A Mapplethorpe supporter was arrested Tuesday after disrupting the news 
conference of a coalition opposed to the showing. Artists and playwrights gave 
speeches in support of the exhibit, and marches and rallies were planned for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
David Ross, director of the art institute, said he was proud to have the show 
of 124 photographs taken by Mapplethorpe from 1969 until shortly before he died 
of AIDS last year in Boston at age 42.

The young actress who played Kate McArdle's daughter on the defunct "Kate &amp; 
Allie" TV sitcom is now an attractive adult actress, but she's still playing 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Ari Meyers is 21 now and co-starring in the new movie thriller "Shackma" with 
Chris Atkins and Roddy McDowall. 
</P>
<P>
Because she is tiny (5-foot-2) and looks a half-dozen years younger than she 
is, Meyers plays a 17-year-old in "Shackma," and a teenager in "My Name is 
Anna," playing the young Patty Duke in a TV film version of Duke's 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
She also is starring at Yale University, where she is in her senior year, 
following in the footsteps of such other academically minded actresses as 
Brooke Shields, Jody Foster and Jennifer Beals. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on "Kate &amp; Allie," Meyers says she enjoyed the experience, but 
is too busy to regret not having an acting job to report to five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved doing the show, but I also enjoy doing TV movies and feature films 
now," she said. "I'm able to attend classes full-time, which I wouldn't have 
been able to do if I had gone right into another series. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of 'Kate &amp; Allie' as one of the things I've done as an actress, 
not as THE highlight of my career. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful experience. It enabled me to go to high school in Manhattan 
and have a 9-to-5 job that didn't take me away from New York, where I was born 
and raised."

Joan Lunden says she is not leaving "Good Morning America," getting a divorce 
or even having an alien's baby.

<P>
Lunden told viewers of ABC's morning show all this Tuesday after she said 
National Enquirer reporters were asking her colleagues if she seems troubled 
lately.

"It was a preemptive strike," she said afterward. "I told them I could either 
do that or just be a wimp and sit back and let them make up whatever they want 
and print it." 
</P>
<P>
Ian Calder, editor of the tabloid in Lantana, Fla., said the queries about 
Lunden concerned problems her husband, a TV producer, has had with lawsuits 
over production bills for "Everyday," a syndicated program on which Lunden is 
host. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, this was just something we were checking out and we've no 
plans to run a story," Calder said.

Norway's Olympic committee approved a pared-down final budget of $1.1 billion 
for the 1994 Winter Games in an effort to meet state demands for cost cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic planners last week presented a final budget of $1.2 billion, but 
Culture Minister Eleonore Bjartveit said the costs had to be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the cuts, the proposed budget is more than triple the original cost 
projections of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic committee President Gerhard Heiberg said 7.5% was cut from last week's 
estimate to meet the $1.1-billion limit set by Norway's Parliament last 
December. He said the difference would be made up with increased revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The rising cost of the Lillehammer games, estimated at $322 million only two 
years ago, has stirred debate in this nation of 4.2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers have said the price cannot be cut if Norway is to adhere to its plan 
of staging all events near the town of Lillehammer in southeast Norway. The 
plan was a key factor in the city's bid.

Former Rams linebacker Carl Ekern was killed in a single-vehicle traffic 
accident in the Mojave Desert early today, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A passer-by found Ekern's vehicle overturned alongside U.S. 395 about 4 a.m., 
CHP Officer Chris Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern, 36, had been thrown from the car and apparently died of head injuries, 
Geiger added. 
</P>
<P>
The investigating officer said the northbound car had run off the highway at an 
unknown speed sometime during the night, then over-corrected across both lanes 
and struck a small dirt berm. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, the vehicle became airborne and rolled several times," Geiger 
said. "During that time, he (Ekern) was ejected and received what appeared to 
be fatal head injuries." 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 125 miles northeast of Los Angeles in Kern County, 
seven miles south of Ridgecrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern lived in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern was selected in the fifth-round of the 1976 draft and played for the Rams 
until retiring after the 1988 season. He became a starter in 1981 and was 
selected to the Pro Bowl in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter at San Jose State, Ekern was named the Pacific Coast 
Athletic Assn.'s player of the year as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern had been a Ram starter at inside linebacker from 1981 until his 
retirement last year. 
</P>
<P>
He led the team in tackles three times and was named to the Pro Bowl in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Although not blessed with great size and speed, Ekern proved durable in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not big, fast, strong and he's not a great athlete, Rams defensive 
coordinator Fritz Shurmer once said. "He's just a a gifted football player." 
</P>
<P>
And the smartest player he has ever known, Shurmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern made up for physical liabilities by succeeding in the classroom. He was 
methodical in his approach to the game, studying films astutely. 
</P>
<P>
"So many guys look at film and don't know what they're seeing," Shurmer said. 
"It's like they're watching like a fan." 
</P>
<P>
He said Ekern knew what to look for, how a back lined up so he could cheat in 
his alignment. 
</P>
<P>
The night before every game, Ekern wrote summary reports about his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern served as the Rams' elected representative to the NFL Players Assn.

<P>
Lakers star Earvin (Magic) Johnson, who led Michigan State University to the 
NCAA championship in 1979, wants to return to his alma mater as a member of the 
school's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Top Michigan Democratic Party officials confirmed that Johnson plans to run for 
a seat on the board in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
In order to run, Johnson would have to re-establish Michigan residency no later 
than Aug. 8 and then be nominated by the Democratic Party at its state 
convention Sept. 8-9 in Flint. 
</P>
<P>
If Johnson wins, he would fill the seat being vacated by MSU trustee Malcolm 
Dade, a Democrat who is retiring. The board has eight members, two of whom are 
elected every two years to staggered, eight-year terms. Democrats dominate the 
current board, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. James J. Blanchard, the leader of the Democratic Party, strongly supports 
Johnson's candidacy and helped recruit the two-time NBA most valuable player 
for the job, the governor's friends and aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party officials said Johnson's popularity would attract traditional 
Democratic and independent voters to the ticket, which would help Blanchard in 
his tough challenge from state Senate Majority Leader John Engler, the likely 
GOP candidate in November. 
</P>

Joel Ferguson, a Democratic Party activist and longtime Johnson friend, said 
the Lakers star is scheduled to return by early next week to his hometown, 
Lansing, to re-establish voter registration so he can legally be on the Nov. 6 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Earvin has agreed to do it. All we have to do is work out the logistics of the 
matter," Ferguson, a Lansing developer, told the Detroit News. "He'll be back 
very soon to take care of all the details." 
</P>
<P>
Through his agent, Johnson said from Los Angeles on Tuesday that he wants to 
serve MSU. "I would love to be part of it, yes, I would be interested," he 
said. "I would be very interested." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 30, starred in basketball at Lansing Everett High School and stayed 
home to play guard for MSU in 1978-79. He left MSU after his sophomore year to 
join the Lakers, where he has led the team to five world championships.

76ERS ACQUIRE 7-7 BOL FROM GOLDEN STATE; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: PHILADELPHIA SENDS A DRAFT CHOICE TO GOLDEN STATE FOR THE CENTER. IN 
ANOTHER DEAL, NUGGETS SEND SCHAYES TO BUCKS FOR ROOKIE FORWARD MILLS.

<P>
The Philadelphia 76ers today acquired 7-7 shot-blocking center Manute Bol from 
Golden State for a 1991 first-round pick in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
In another trade, the Milwaukee Bucks today sent their first-round draft pick, 
forward Terry Mills, to the Denver Nuggets for veteran center Danny Schayes. 
</P>
<P>
"Manute Bol is the premiere shot-blocker in the NBA today," said Harold Katz, 
76ers owner. "It is obvious to us that our biggest need last year was clogging 
the middle. We feel there is nobody in the game today that can do it better." 
</P>
<P>
The 225-pound Bol, 27, has been in the NBA five seasons, three with the 
Washington Bullets and two with Golden State. He played in 75 games last season 
with the Warriors and was the fourth-leading shot-blocker in the league with 
238, or 3.17 per game. He averaged only 1.9 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Bol's acquisition is the latest in the Sixers' moves to bolster their inside 
game, which suffered after the club traded center Moses Malone in 1986. 
Philadelphia last season acquired power forward Rick Mahorn, a move that helped 
them to the NBA Atlantic Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
Bol likely will be a backup to center Mike Gminski. 
</P>
<P>
Bol has blocked 300 or more shots in three seasons, including a career-high 397 
his rookie year to lead the league, and a league-leading 345 in the 1988-89 
season. 
</P>
<P>
His career shooting averages are 57.1% from the free-throw line and 42.5% from 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks had announced their intention to trade the 6-10 Mills right after 
making him 16th pick in the June draft. But the team had to wait for the 
league's salary cap to expand today before it could fit Schayes onto the 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny's rugged style of play will aide us tremendously in the physical Eastern 
Conference," Milwaukee Coach Del Harris said. "Our staff identified our No. 1 
need to be the acquisition of another center to relieve Jack Sikma of excessive 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Mills averaged 18.1 points and eight rebounds last season at Michigan. Schayes, 
a first-round draft pick of the Utah Jazz in 1981, has spent the last 7 1/2 
seasons with the Nuggets. He averaged 10.4 points and 6.5 rebounds for Denver 
last season.

HIALEAH PARK DENIED EXCLUSIVE DATES, WILL SKIP '90-'91 SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
RACING: A DECISION ON WHETHER TO PERMANENTLY CLOSE THE FINANCIALLY TROUBLED 
TRACK WILL BE MADE LATER.

HIALEAH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Financially troubled Hialeah Park, unable to obtain the exclusive racing dates 
it sought, has decided not to open during the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The historic thoroughbred track withdrew its racing application for the coming 
winter Tuesday, the deadline for making such a move. Hialeah retained its 
racing permit, and a decision on whether to close permanently will be made 
later, an attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Track officials ignored a proposal from the owner of nearby Gulfstream Park and 
Calder Race Course. Bertram Firestone said he was willing to sponsor a 
nonprofit organization to conduct an annual meeting of a month or less at 
Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah was forced to close last season's scheduled 158-day meet after just 25 
days because of poor attendance. This winter's schedule called for racing from 
Jan. 4 to March 10, which meant Hialeah would have gone head-to-head throughout 
its meet against Calder or Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
The schedules of Firestone's two tracks tie up virtually the entire calendar. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Monday involving attorneys from the three tracks, Hialeah 
requested 49 exclusive dates. Attorney Wilbur E. Brewton, special counsel for 
Calder and Gulfstream, rejected the request. 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah in recent years has had smaller attendance and handles than Calder and 
Gulfstream on comparable dates, Brewton said. Giving Hialeah so many exclusive 
dates would mean reduced purses and state tax revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah was once one of the nation's premier tracks, but shifting South Florida 
demographics have left it in a poor location. The track lost an estimated $1.5 
million during its short-circuited season last winter while running 
head-to-head against Calder, which is in the area's tourist and retirement 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
John Van Lindt, special counsel for Hialeah, said the track deserves exclusive 
dates because Calder and Gulfstream, both owned by Firestone, enjoy a monopoly, 
and horsemen across the nation say Hialeah "has an important place in American 
racing." 
</P>
<P>
Under Firestone's proposal to sponsor a nonprofit organization at Hialeah, he 
would take over the track's lease and supply management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some expense to him," Brewton said. "But he doesn't really care, 
if saving Hialeah is in the best interest of Florida." 
</P>
<P>
Van Lindt was less than enthusiastic about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose anything is possible," the Hialeah attorney said. "But it doesn't 
sound terribly economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah owner John Brunetti was out of town and unavailable for comment, an 
aide said. The Brunetti family and the Hialeah board of directors will meet 
"within the next few weeks" to discuss the track's future, Van Lindt said. 
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Rudy Garcia (R-Hialeah) said the Legislature might consider 
re-regulation of Florida's racing industry to preserve Hialeah.

DOWN AGAIN TOPS THE FIELD IN BELLES RACE

<P>
Six fillies and mares with serious turf portfolios will race at Del Mar 
Thursday afternoon in the $55,000 Belles for Mental Health purse. 
</P>
<P>
The race, which will be contested under allowance conditions, is scheduled to 
be run at a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the cast for the feature is Down Again, a 6-year-old mare by Encino who 
sports a hefty bankroll that now reads at $578,021. The bay Kentucky-bred was 
last out July 11 at Hollywood Park, where she was beaten by less than a length 
on the turf by the Argentinian mare Jablina Brown, who scored here last 
Saturday in the Grade II Palomar Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Black has the call on Down Again Thursday at top weight of 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the full field for the main event listed in post position order with 
their riders and weights: Triomphe, 116 pounds, Russell Baze the rider; Paper 
Princess, 118, Laffit Pincay Jr.; Formidable Lady, 120, Patrick Valenzuela; 
Down Again; Sonilla, 116, Eddie Delahoussaye, and Run To Jenny, 116, Gary 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Formidable Lady has four wins, five seconds and two thirds from 18 starts for 
an earnings mark that has reached $246,175. Her most recent outing was in the 
same allowance race July 11 at Hollywood that Jablina Brown won. 
</P>
<P>
Paper Princess won the $107,600 Valkyr Handicap at Hollywood June 23.

Following are the comments of Sunday Silence's trainer, Charlie Whittingham, 
who was preparing for Saturday's $600,000 Arlington Challenge Cup at Arlington 
International Racecourse. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's main competition for the race is Steinlen, who is trained by 
D. Wayne Lukas. Steinlen won the 1989 Arlington Million. Lukas and Whittingham 
are longtime rivals and don't always see eye-to-eye. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Were you a little surprised to see Lukas pull Criminal Type out of 
Saturday's race and replace him with a turf horse like Steinlen? 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham: No, not really. Wayne is a fan -- Wayne Lukas, he doesn't sit 
around and wait for them to come up. He takes his chances. He's a gambler. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Regarding gambling, you're gambling a little bit too by taking Steinlen on 
at this point of Sunday Silence's career. If Steinlen jumps up and runs as well 
on the dirt as he has on the grass, he may prove to be a spectacular horse. 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, that's possible, but he's 7 years old, so he's got age and he's 
seasoned well. But I'm not frightened of him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You've got a little age on Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yep. So we're trading each away. He's got an old horse and we've got an old 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is this the best horse you've ever trained? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. (He won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness), and he does everything 
and he ran with a very good horse when he won with Easy Goer. They were the two 
best 3-year-olds that year in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Lukas has commented that he's pretty certain his horse is going in the race 
to win. How do you feel about that? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I think everybody in there is going in to race to win because most 
people don't like to run for fourth money. We had a very good workout this 
morning (Tuesday), half a mile in 47.5. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you have any specific strategy going into the race on Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not really. You never know how a race will come up. Most jockeys forget what 
you tell them anyway.

</P>
<P>
STAGE: DECADES AGO, CHARLES PIERCE LEFT THE PASADENA PLAYHOUSE TO LAUNCH HIS 
CAREER. NOW HE'S BACK WITH HIS FAMED CABARET ACT, PORTRAYING LEGENDARY SCREEN 
ACTRESSES.

<P>
He arrived at the Pasadena Playhouse when he was 20 years old, wide-eyed and 
ready to conquer the world of stage and screen. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 44 years later, Charles Pierce has returned -- but his wide eyes are 
highlighted by shadow and mascara. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit eerie to be here," said the 64-year-old Pierce, who has made 
his mark impersonating Hollywood's most glamorous female celebrities. "It's 
exciting to be back where I started, but it's also a bit ghostly. It evokes a 
lot of memories." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who lives in North Hollywood, retired less than a year ago. But when 
Bette Davis, his trademark character, died last October, he was deluged with 
calls to tour once more. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he is tired of traveling around the country with suitcases, 
props and wardrobe, Pierce brought his famous act out of the closet, revamped 
it and gave it a new name: "The Legendary Ladies of the Silver Screen, All 
Talking, All Singing, All Dancing . . . All Dead." 
</P>
<P>
The show has received rave reviews in New York and San Francisco, with critics 
in the two cities calling Pierce "the best," "the dean of male actresses" and a 
"brilliant nightclub performer." 
</P>
<P>
His cabaret act, to open at the Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theater on Tuesday 
night, features such Pierce staples as Davis, Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead, Joan 
Crawford and Gloria Swanson. The show runs until Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Even off stage, Pierce constantly evokes the women in his act, shifting in and 
out of character. His blue-gray eyes light up when he tells a new joke or an 
old one: "I feel like a million. . . . But I'll take them 10 at a time," he 
quipped in his best Mae West, pretending with a touch of melodrama to brush 
aside a fallen strand from his closely cropped, slightly thinning hair. 
</P>
<P>
During the 36 years Pierce has been playing Hollywood leading ladies, little 
has changed in his act, save his audience, and the girdle he bought a few years 
back to hide a growing paunch. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting recently on the sun-splashed balcony of the Pasadena Playhouse, Pierce 
recalled the circuitous route that has taken him back this week to the 
Spanish-style theater. When he first thought of being an entertainer, he never 
imagined the job would be a drag -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 14 years old and saw an ad in Theater Arts Magazine," said Pierce, a 
native of Watertown, N.Y. "I wrote away and they sent me a brochure that showed 
students on this very balcony studying their scripts. It showed them in makeup 
class, in dance class. There was no doubt in my mind about what I was going to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
After working as a radio announcer during high school and for several years 
afterward, Pierce headed West to attend the Playhouse's acting school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absorbed in the thought of coming to the Pasadena Playhouse to become an 
actor," Pierce said. "For two years this playhouse was like an ivory tower. The 
world did not exist outside these walls." 
</P>
<P>
After acting school, Pierce bounced between his old radio job in Watertown, 
summer stock in Newport, R.I., and the Playhouse, where he played Marley's 
ghost in "A Christmas Carol" and gave solo readings in the Balcony Theater. 
</P>
<P>
By 1952 he was doing monologues and stand-up comedy at the Cabaret Concert on 
Sunset Boulevard. "We didn't get paid," Pierce said. "A lot of actors and 
actresses went there. They were waiting for that big break." 
</P>
<P>
It was in those early years that Pierce began to develop a style that critics 
say sets him apart from other impersonators. Rather than rely on costume to 
create the illusion, Pierce is a master of more subtle forms of mimicry, such 
as facial expressions, hand movements and inflections in the voices of the 
movie idols he has studied. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pierce never lets his audience forget that there is an actor 
behind the mask. Indeed, one of his trademarks is his ability to seamlessly 
weave out-of-character remarks into the campy tapestry of his act. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he found his way to the Club LaVie in Altadena, where he received 
his first paycheck for performing. At the time, he worked in a pantomime's 
black shirt and black pants, using props to realize his characters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd use a leopard stole, a boa, a hat, but I wasn't in drag," Pierce said, his 
hands moving in a welter as he pretended to don each prop again. "I didn't even 
think about wearing drag." 
</P>
<P>
It was at Club LaVie that Pierce started to perfect his voices, male and 
female: Katharine Hepburn, Marlon Brando, Jack Benny, Bette Davis and Eleanor 
Roosevelt. He wrote his own material, satirizing the actors and actresses who 
starred in the great movies of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"If you hadn't seen 'African Queen,' 'Sunset Boulevard' or 'Shane,' you 
wouldn't know what I was talking about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After doing the show in Altadena, Pierce packed up his bon mots and took them 
across the country to the Echo Club in Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was illegal in Florida to cross-dress in the early 1960s, Pierce 
continued doing his act using the props that simply suggested his characters. 
He would prowl the thrift shops for a cigarette holder or a glittery dress to 
slip into over his pants. "I did that camp wardrobe act for a long time," 
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in progressive San Francisco, where Pierce next took his act to the Gilded 
Cage, impersonating women in full costume was something that evolved over time. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until the mid '60s that I began to do full female impersonations," 
Pierce said. "High heels, falsies, makeup . . . it was considered much more 
outrageous at the time." 
</P>
<P>
His was a nightclub act, done mostly for gay audiences, and theater 
presentations were "few and far between." 
</P>
<P>
Although things have changed since he first began doing his act, Pierce said 
his show still shocks some people. "With 'Tootsie' and 'La Cage aux Folles,' 
it's been more accepted," he explained. "It's not considered outrageous like it 
used to be, but it can still outrage some people." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who has hung up his gowns for good several times since the mid-1980s in 
the hope of playing character roles in television and movies, said that while 
he is tired of traveling, he never tires of his ladies. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think when Bette Davis goes, there goes my act," Pierce said. "But 
she's larger than life. I'd like to do her on Broadway -- I'd like to play 
Broadway before everything is tucked away for good."

HISTORIC FEET AND A LOT OF SOLE

<P>
It was over beers with a friend after the late show at the State Theater in 
Waseca, Minn., that David Kunst hatched his audacious plan to walk around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
His marriage on the rocks, bored with his job as a Waseca County surveyor and 
looking for adventure, Kunst, 30, enlisted his 22-year-old brother, John, to 
join him on the adventure of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
On June 20, 1970, several thousand well-wishers gathered in front of the State 
Theater, where David moonlighted as a projectionist, to see the brothers off. 
And then, with a mule dubbed Willie Make It carrying their supplies and the 
high school band playing "King of the Road," the two brothers simply walked out 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
Four years, three months and 16 days later, David Kunst walked back into town 
and into the "Guinness Book of World Records" as the first person verified to 
have walked around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the Kunst brothers met with Princess Grace in Monaco's royal 
palace, had breakfast with Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl in his home in 
northern Italy and became the first people in 200 years to bring a mule into 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
They also endured subzero temperatures in eastern Turkey, 128-degree 
temperatures in the Desert of Death in Afghanistan, blistered feet and 
dysentery -- and they depended on the kindness of strangers, who frequently 
gave them free lodging and food (most memorably sheep's eyeball soup in 
Afghanistan). 
</P>
<P>
Then tragedy struck. 
</P>
<P>
While camping on an isolated mountain pass in Afghanistan one night two years 
into their walk, the brothers were attacked by bandits. John Kunst was killed 
instantly, a bullet piercing his heart. David Kunst was wounded in the chest 
and left for dead. 
</P>
<P>
After recuperating for four months back in Minnesota, Kunst returned to the 
exact spot where his brother had been murdered. With his other brother, Pete, 
accompanying him for a year, Kunst continued the walk that ended in Waseca on 
Oct. 5, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, David Kunst walked 14,500 miles, crossed four continents and 13 
countries and wore out 21 pairs of shoes. He also generated worldwide media 
coverage and, in 1979, co-authored a book, "The Man Who Walked Around the 
World." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years after taking the first of an estimated 20 million steps, Kunst, 
now a Newport Beach resident, is still getting a lot of mileage out of the 
global adventure that also landed him in "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a feat as dramatic as circumnavigating the earth on foot is not 
something you just walk away from. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 12 years, Kunst has been telling his globe-trotting tale at 
schools, women's clubs, PTA meetings and retirement and church groups 
throughout Southern California. And, more often than not, a reporter from the 
local newspaper will turn up to write yet another story about Kunst's dramatic 
adventure -- after Kunst has called to inform the paper of his upcoming 
speaking engagement. 
</P>
<P>
If there's one thing Kunst learned while circumnavigating the world, it's how 
to generate publicity. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in his Newport Beach townhouse shortly after the 20th 
anniversary of the start of his walk, Kunst flipped through a stack of 
newspaper clippings chronicling recent appearances in Glendale, Escondido, 
Poway, Ridgecrest and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly endless interest in his walk -- even two decades later -- is no 
surprise to Kunst, whom the press dubbed the "Earthwalker." 
</P>
<P>
As he says, the story of his walk is filled with "adventure, intrigue, romance 
and tragedy -- just about everything. Also, I think it's my excitement. Twenty 
years later, I still get excited when I start talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Turning to his parents, Al and Augusta Kunst, who were visiting from Clear 
Lake, Iowa, he said, "You've heard my programs. Do I get excited about it?" 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think he finished yesterday," his mother said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the start of Kunst's walk, the 1990 
edition of the "Guinness Book of Records" in England featured a color spread on 
Kunst in the section on "Endurance and Endeavour." Kunst also has received 
congratulatory letters from Sen. Pete Wilson, First Lady Barbara Bush and a 
deputy assistant to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
So how did the Earthwalker himself celebrate the 20th anniversary of his 
record-setting walk? 
</P>
<P>
"I went sailing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Kunst does more talking than walking. 
</P>
<P>
Now 50 and about 20 pounds heavier than when he was a "lean, mean walking 
machine" treading 40 miles a day, Kunst limits his walking to 30-minute strolls 
around Balboa Island in the evenings with his wife, Jenni Samuel, an Irvine 
elementary schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel is the "romance" part of Kunst's around-the-world walk: They met at a 
party in Australia during the walk. And after Kunst's mule died of a heart 
attack, Samuel hitched her car to the 200-year-old wooden Turkish wagon Kunst 
had acquired to carry his supplies. Driving in low gear alongside Kunst, she 
accompanied him for 1,000 miles of his walk across Australia. When his walk 
ended in 1974, Kunst returned to Australia and later married his "Australian 
schoolteacher." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Kunst celebrated the walk's anniversary by serving as honorary 
chairman of the Newport Beach Public Library's 70th Anniversary Celebration 
Walk two weeks earlier. He figured that was close enough in time to commemorate 
his own walk. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus," he said with a laugh, "I figured I could do that walk: It's 2.2 miles." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his globe-trotting reputation, Kunst seems to have settled into 
somewhat of the same kind of middle-class rut he abandoned back in Waseca 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving to Orange County in 1978, Kunst has managed a small apartment 
complex and delivers a newspaper from 3 to 6 every morning in Newport Beach, 
where, after flying from Australia in 1974, he struck out at water's edge and 
began the last leg of his walk. 
</P>
<P>
The early work schedule, he said, "leaves the days open to do my loves, my 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
Walking around the world is a story he never tires of telling. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it's hard to believe that the loquacious Kunst is the same man who 
froze up the first time he was interviewed on television. As one reporter 
wrote, Kunst speaks in capitals, the words just tumbling out. 
</P>
<P>
Once he begins talking about the walk, it's hard to stop him. He has no sooner 
begun recounting the crush of people that would swarm around his wagon while 
walking through India than he's reminded of the time that he and brother Pete 
were granted special permission to walk through the Khyber Pass between 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, thus becoming "the first non-Asians to officially 
walk through the Khyber Pass since Alexander the Great." 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," he said, "I always thought we should have gotten into 
the record book for having done that." 
</P>
<P>
The high point of the walk for Kunst was when he and John met Princess Grace. 
The princess kept their gift of one of Willie Make It II's shoes on her desk 
and later wrote a letter expressing her amazement that Kunst continued the walk 
after his brother was killed. "He showed," she wrote, "enormous courage and 
tenacity." 
</P>
<P>
John's death was unquestionably the low point of the walk and gave rise to the 
one time that the extensive press coverage backfired. 
</P>
<P>
During the walk, the two brothers had been urging people to donate to UNICEF, 
the international children's charity. But an Afghan newspaper incorrectly 
reported that they were carrying the donations with them. Kunst later learned 
that the bandits who attacked them had been following them for three days. 
</P>
<P>
Kunst, however, has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I never think that way, and John wouldn't either," he said. "The way we looked 
at life was that if you're going to die -- I mean, he would rather have died 
doing that than in an accident out on the freeway someplace. He told me more 
than once -- and I said the same thing to him: We loved walking around the 
world; it was a great adventure, and if we died walking around the world, tell 
mom and dad we died happy."

PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER EDITOR TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eugene L. Roberts Jr., one of the most honored newspaper editors in America, 
stunned his staff Tuesday by announcing that he will retire Sept. 1 as 
executive editor and president of the Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 58, made his name as a champion of hard investigative reporting, 
editorial independence and the idea that an aggressive, even antagonistic 
product would win readers and eventually financial success. His transformation 
of the beleaguered Inquirer in the 1970s and its ultimate victory over the 
rival Bulletin seemed to prove his theory. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he had anticipated early retirement as long as three years ago but 
stayed because of "family responsibilities that made it seem the wrong time." 
But many in the industry and at his newspaper believe that Roberts became 
disenchanted with changes at Knight-Ridder Inc., the paper's owner. The 
Miami-based company has recently emphasized strict profit targets and publicly 
stressed that journalists should see themselves as serving customers and not 
simply providing news and acting as watchdogs over government. 
</P>
<P>
"The corporate mentality at Knight-Ridder has changed," said one Inquirer 
reporter. "For the last few years, it has been us (the Inquirer) against them 
(Knight-Ridder), and it looks like 'them' won." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the comments of many staffers and outside observers, Knight-Ridder 
executives praised Roberts in statements issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Gene Roberts has brought great honor to The Inquirer, to Knight-Ridder and to 
the profession of newspaper editing in this country," Knight-Ridder Chairman 
and Chief Executive James K. Batten said. "His is a unique record that will 
long stand as an inspiration for others to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts will be replaced by Maxwell E. P. King, 46, a protege and longtime 
editor who for the past three years has been running the paper's circulation 
department. He will have the title of editor of the Inquirer and executive vice 
president of Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
King, who is the maternal grandson of legendary book editor Maxwell Perkins and 
the brother of actor Perry King, was picked by the publisher and 
Knight-Ridder's corporate staff, but Roberts said he was consulted at length 
about potential successors. Inquirer Managing Editor Gene Foreman will become 
executive editor, and Deputy Managing Editor James Naughton will become 
managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said in an interview that he will now travel and perhaps eventually 
take a teaching position. He will also serve as a consultant to Knight-Ridder. 
</P>
<P>
In his 18 years in Philadelphia, Roberts' paper won a startling 17 Pulitzer 
prizes, its circulation rose nearly 20% and it transformed itself from a paper 
"flat on its back journalistically to one with few peers," said Craig Ammerman, 
former editor of the rival Philadelphia Bulletin. The Inquirer eventually 
surpassed the Bulletin, which closed in 1982, and inspired a movement within 
the industry in which newspaper chains known for journalistic quality bought 
struggling papers and tried to outdo the local competition. 
</P>
<P>
None, however, was able to duplicate Roberts' achievement, including his own 
company, which failed to repeat that success in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Roberts has had sharp clashes with Knight-Ridder management 
over his budget, particularly since the rise of the company's current 
president, P. Anthony Ridder. Before that, Roberts was stung that he was not 
named publisher. Instead, the paper installed Robert Hall, a Knight-Ridder 
official from Detroit. On Tuesday, Ridder praised Roberts for creating 
"unquestionably one of the great newspapers in America." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts started in journalism as a farm reporter for the Goldsboro (N.C.) 
News-Argus. He also worked at the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, the News and 
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., and the Detroit Free Press before he joined the New 
York Times. Roberts covered the civil rights movement in the 1960s and the 
Vietnam War for the newspaper, later becoming its national editor. 
</P>
<P>
The tributes to Roberts were swift in coming. Bill Kovach, curator at the 
Nieman Foundation at Harvard and a former colleague at the New York Times, said 
Roberts is "one of the last of that generation for whom the separation of 
business and the editorial department was a complete and absolute principle. . 
. . I really do believe it was a person like Gene Roberts that Jefferson and 
Madison and (George) Mason had in mind when they crafted the First Amendment 
for the press in a self-governing society." 
</P>
<P>
"He has cast a hell of a shadow on journalism in his day," said Benjamin C. 
Bradlee, executive editor of the Washington Post and now one of the last of his 
generation's prominent editors. "It can't be that newspapers are better off 
without him." 
</P>
<P>
The news provoked tears among some of Roberts' staff and open anger among 
others, plus a lengthy standing ovation in the Inquirer newsroom. Before that, 
in a meeting with top editors, Roberts said he would never run another 
newspaper. Then, fighting tears, he was unable to continue and walked out.

REMEMBER WHEN; 
</P>
<P>
MANY OF THE HIGHS WERE LOWE'S WITH THE ORIGINAL CHARGERS

<P>
Even the most imaginative script writer couldn't have dreamed up a fantasy to 
top Paul Lowe's debut with the original Chargers 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As an undrafted free agent, Lowe seemingly had little chance to win a job, but 
he changed that in a matter of seconds. The first time he got his hands on the 
ball, on the opening kickoff of the Chargers' first exhibition game in 1960, he 
ran 105 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were based in Los Angeles only for that season, which marked the 
founding of the American Football League, and the game was played at the 
Coliseum. Lowe's theatrics laid the foundation for a 27-7 victory over the New 
York Titans, forerunners of the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
That first impression helped Lowe stick with the team, yet it only scratched 
the surface of what he was to accomplish. He went on to become one of the most 
honored players in Charger history. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that Lowe: 
</P>
<P>
* Led the AFL in rushing in 1965 with a then-record 1,121 yards and was voted 
the league's player of the year by The Sporting News and United Press 
International. 
</P>
<P>
* Tops Chargers career rushing list with 4,963 yards in seven seasons, having 
fallen short of 5,000 only because he missed the 1962 season with a broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
* Led the team in rushing five times, topping 1,000 yards twice. 
</P>
<P>
* Rushed for 100 yards or more in a game 16 times, hitting a high of 183 
against the Denver Broncos in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
* Gained 165 yards against the Houston Oilers in the AFL's first championship 
game in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
* Made his longest run from scrimmage, 87 yards for a touchdown against the 
Dallas Texans (now the Kansas City Chiefs) in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
* Returned a punt 81 yards for a touchdown against the Boston (now New England) 
Patriots in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
* Inducted into the Chargers' Hall of Fame in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Would all of this had happened if Lowe hadn't gone all the way with the 
Chargers' first-ever kickoff? 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, 53, still a San Diego resident, is now warehouse supervisor at the R.J. 
Donovan Correctional Institution in Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, that first kickoff return was a great thrill," he said. "I broke a 
couple of tackles and faked a couple of guys out, and I was gone. My father was 
in the stands, and he had never seen me play football before, so that gave me a 
great feeling. He said he didn't think I could run that fast. 
</P>
<P>
"But that didn't mean I had the team made. Sid (Coach Gillman) was still 
playing some guys ahead of me. There were Ron Waller, Luther Carr, Charlie 
Flowers, Royce Womble and Howie Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
"In a preseason game against Dallas, Waller and I were back on kickoff returns. 
Waller told me to take the ball wherever it was, like he didn't want to run a 
kickoff back. So I went out of my lane, and I fumbled the ball but still went 
30 or 40 yards. Sid asked why I went out of my lane. Waller told him the truth, 
so he cut Waller." 
</P>
<P>
Even after that, Lowe wasn't safe. There still were cuts to be made after the 
final exhibition game against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember talking to Esther, Sid Gillman's wife, before the game," Lowe said. 
"She said, 'Paul, this game will either make you or break you.' I knew there 
was a lot of pressure on me. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, I had a big day against Denver, and from that day on, I 
never looked back. I kept working harder and harder." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe was born in Homer, La., but grew up in Los Angeles and attended Centennial 
High School in Compton, where he was a star in track and basketball as well as 
football. He played college football at Oregon State, where he also was a 
hurdler, high jumper and sprint-relay runner in track. 
</P>
<P>
The tryout with the Chargers wasn't Lowe's first. In 1959, after being 
overlooked in the National Football League draft and with the AFL still on the 
drawing board, he had a free-agent fling with the San Francisco 49ers and came 
close to making it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I wasn't drafted," he said. "There are a lot of good athletes 
out there who never get a chance. But Pappy Waldorf was scouting talent for the 
49ers, and I had had so many good days against Cal when he was coaching there 
that he asked me if I wanted to try out. 
</P>
<P>
"I stuck with the 49ers until the last cut. But then I hurt my ankle, and a 
rookie can't afford to get hurt unless he's a No. 1 or No. 2 draft choice. So 
they cut me, and I came on home to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Lowe applied for two jobs -- with the Los Angeles Police Department 
and with the Carte Blanche credit service, owned by Barron Hilton. He took the 
latter, working in the mail room and studying computers. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton then became the owner of the new Chargers and hired Frank Leahy, the 
ex-Notre Dame coach, as his first general manager. Between them, they took a 
preliminary step in the discovery of Paul Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
"Leahy found out I was working for Carte Blanche and asked me if I would play 
football in the AFL," Lowe said. "I said yes. Well, he never got back to me, 
but Sid Gillman did, and by that time he had become general manager as well as 
coach (Leahy resigned because of illness). 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget that first training camp. We were at Chapman College, and it 
seemed like they had a thousand guys trying out. Everybody the Rams had cut in 
the five years before that was there." 
</P>
<P>
As tough as it was for Lowe to make the team, he started on opening day and had 
an outstanding rookie season, gaining 855 yards and averaging a career-high 6.3 
per carry. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Chargers played in virtual anonymity at the Coliseum, they moved to 
San Diego in 1961 and business picked up considerably at Balboa Stadium. They 
played there until San Diego Stadium opened in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mind relocating," Lowe said. "I bought a home in San Diego and got 
away from all that hustle and bustle in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Once established in San Diego, Lowe became a crowd favorite at Balboa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I played to the fans," he said. "We were so close to them, it was like being 
on stage. People would talk to us while the games were going on." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were a powerhouse in those early years, winning Western Division 
championships in five of their first six seasons and the league title in 1963. 
Their performance in their 51-10 victory over the Patriots in the 1963 
championship game was probably their best ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great coach in Gillman," Lowe said. "He was a master of a coach, a 
great improvisor. If some other team ran a play against us that he liked, he 
wasn't afraid to steal it. He would add a little to it, and it would work. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of offensive weapons, and we had an offensive line that got 
better every year. Ron Mix at tackle was one of the most intelligent 
ballplayers I ever saw. He was smarter than a quarterback, plus he had speed. 
</P>
<P>
"The year we won the championship, everybody thought we could have beaten the 
Bears, who won it in the NFL. We both had great defenses, but we were more 
explosive on offense and our quarterback, Tobin Rote, was a coach on the field. 
He could read defenses like a preacher could read the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famers Gillman and Mix put into words just how good Lowe was. 
</P>
<P>
Gillman, now retired, said, "Paul was the best running back over the 10 years 
of the AFL. He had speed like Gale Sayers, he could cut and he had a great 
change of pace. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked to use him on the quarterback toss with Mix in front of him, and he 
could go outside as well as anybody in football. He didn't have great hands, so 
we threw him short stuff he could handle, and he turned a lot of those little 
passes into big gains." 
</P>
<P>
Mix, now a San Diego attorney, gave Lowe some of the credit for his own 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul probably made us as well known as offensive linemen can get," Mix said. 
"Guys like him and Keith Lincoln and Lance Alworth made things happen. He was 
an explosive outside runner. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of being a great football player, he was a pleasant guy, fun to be 
around, with an impish personality." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe's one regret is that he didn't finish his career with the Chargers. They 
released him after the 1967 season, and he spent 1968 and 1969 with the Chiefs. 
He was only a spot player in Kansas City and wound up five yards shy of 5,000, 
but he bowed out fittingly by winning a Super Bowl ring with the 1969 Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 5,000 at one time," he said, "and then I lost five on a sweep and never 
carried again."
