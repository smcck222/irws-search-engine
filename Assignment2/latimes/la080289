Peace talks between Angola's government and UNITA rebels have been delayed and 
guerrillas have again broken a cease-fire, the official Angolan news agency 
Angop reported. The agency said a third round of talks scheduled for Zaire was 
postponed because Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, the mediator, was abroad. 
No new date was announced for negotiations centering on how to monitor the 
shaky, five-week-old cease-fire between Angolan government forces and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, led by Jonas Savimbi.

HIGH ISLAND, Tex.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Chantal roared ashore Tuesday on the upper Texas Gulf Coast with 80 
m.p.h. winds and driving rain, killing one person and leaving scattered power 
outages and flooding but apparently causing little serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
The storm was blamed for the death of a man who fell from an oil platform in 
the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans. No injuries were reported in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The hurricane's sustained wind speed never exceeded 80 m.p.h. and decreased to 
75 m.p.h. as it moved inland. About three hours after the storm made landfall 
Tuesday morning at High Island, it had weakened further and was downgraded to a 
tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people had been plucked from capsized fishing vessels in the stormy 
Gulf of Mexico by Coast Guard helicopter crews. The Coast Guard also sent a 
patrol boat and a jet into the storm Tuesday to take water pumps to two shrimp 
boats in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 15 inches of rain was forecast for parts of eastern Texas, where many 
areas remained saturated from a tropical storm six weeks ago. Meteorologists 
said that with rivers and creeks still high from the earlier rain, residents in 
low flood-prone areas should take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
A Galveston shelter housed some 1,000 people for the night, but it was closed 
by midday as the worst of the storm passed. Shelters in Port Arthur and 
Beaumont were vacant by mid-morning after only about an inch of rain fell. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people spent the night at the high school in High Island, a lightly 
populated fishing and resort community midway between Port Arthur and 
Galveston. 
</P>
<P>
"My house started to move and it's not a mobile home," said Jim Chaney, of 
nearby Crystal Beach. "That's about the time we decided we should be moving 
along." 
</P>
<P>
"We were real lucky," added Donny Jones, who lives near High Island. His home 
suffered minor damage when a 60-year-old pecan tree blew over. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, winds up to 40 m.p.h. caused downtown skyscrapers to sway and 
creak, but no damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
Roofs were blown off a few houses and some utility poles were blown down along 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
At High Island, barrels rolled along roads and the metal roof of a Veterans of 
Foreign Wars hall was shredded. Residents lost power although the few 
businesses in town remained open. 
</P>
<P>
"We get worse thunderstorms than this," said Betty Barrow, a 28-year resident 
of High Island. "People are always casual about these things here. The 
old-timers don't worry about these things; they just stay."

PAYZANT PRAISED BUT TRUSTEES STRESS FURTHER NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city schools Supt. Tom Payzant continues to have the strong support 
of school trustees, but board members want him to hold individual schools more 
accountable for carrying out new educational programs and innovations. 
</P>
<P>
That was the main message in a summary released Tuesday by the Board of 
Education after its annual evaluation of Payzant's performance. In other major 
action, trustees also indicated they will change the term black to African 
American in labeling black students when a vote on that proposal comes up early 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Susan Davis said the board applauds Payzant's encouragement to 
major innovations at schools, his successful agreement with the teachers union 
to begin cooperative decision-making and his high visibility in several 
national educational reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Referred to Dropouts 
</P>
<P>
But trustees also said that Payzant needs to hold the feet of his assistants 
and school principals more to the fire than in the past by setting specific 
goals, short- and long-range, that can be met if diligently pursued. They 
referred specifically to the plethora of dropout-prevention initiatives, some 
of which have been poorly coordinated during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
The board also said that Payzant should express his vision of San Diego's 
educational future more clearly, asking him "to dream a little, to articulate 
his vision of a better educational experience for all children." But they 
emphasize that Payzant continues to work candidly and honestly with trustees, 
despite the addition of two new board members this year. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the five-member board said Tuesday that they would approve the 
name change for black students recommended by Payzant and Assistant Supt. 
George Frey, head of the integration services and community relations division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
African American Backed 
</P>
<P>
A majority of black secondary school students surveyed earlier this year by 
Frey said they preferred the term black but the support for African American 
increased by grade. In addition, a parallel survey of black community leaders 
and parents showed support for the new term, which the Rev. Jesse Jackson first 
focused attention on earlier this year as a way to stress historical and 
cultural roots. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Shirley Weber, a professor of Afro-American studies at San Diego 
State University, said use of the new name is a more accurate description of 
black people and their origins. Colleague Jim Roache, while agreeing with the 
proposal, nevertheless dampened excitement of some speakers by saying the 
board's time could be better spent pushing the success of district programs to 
improve the dismal academic performance by many blacks.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 9 HOUSES WILL BE RAZED FOR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School officials, faced with overcrowded conditions in the area's elementary 
schools, are planning to raze nine houses in southwest Pomona to make way for a 
new campus, angering some homeowners who claim that they cannot afford to move 
out of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The school board has voted unanimously to acquire, through eminent domain, 10 
acres of residential land -- including one vacant four-acre lot -- on the 
southwest corner of White and Grand avenues and to offer the owners market 
value for the property. A private firm has appraised the land at a value of 
$3,035,000. 
</P>
<P>
The site will be used for a 20-classroom elementary school for about 600 
students. The school, which will cost from $5 million to $6 million to build, 
is expected to ease the crunch at Lexington, Madison and Mendoza elementary 
schools in south Pomona.

IVORY POACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your front page of July l9 displayed a full-color photo of this decade's 
supreme act of idiocy in the name of conservation -- the government of Kenya 
burning some 12 tons of contraband elephant tusks seized from poachers. 
</P>
<P>
If I was a poacher, I would like nothing better, aside from the profits on 
those tusks, than to see them destroyed. If the tusks had been dumped on the 
ivory market, it would have at least temporarily depressed the price of ivory, 
reducing the incentive for some poachers to kill elephants. 
</P>
<P>
And with the $3 million that went up in smoke, the Kenyan government could have 
hired and equipped a force of game wardens far better than the motley crew it 
now has. 
</P>
<P>
Selling the tusks to places where the ivory trade is legal could have meant 
that several hundred less elephants would be killed to supply the demand for 
ivory. The simple and obvious fact is that the tusk burning publicity stunt 
will insure the slaughter of more elephants.

ELECTION REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning the current discussion of campaign reforms, I would like to make a 
suggestion. Ban paid political advertising on television. These commercials are 
becoming increasingly less informative and more emotion-seeking. Isn't it 
better for voters to base their decisions based on facts, rather than emotions? 
Let's reduce the dependence on media consultants and advertising executives. 
</P>
<P>
Since television advertising is a major expense of a large campaign, its 
elimination would reduce the amount of money needed to enter a campaign and/or 
allow more money to be spent on campaign methods of more substance. Reducing 
the amount of money needed to run a campaign would also be a very effective way 
to limit political action committee influence, which seems to be what everyone 
wants nowadays.

AIRLINE CRASH IN SIOUX CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notwithstanding Capt. Haynes' admirable and extreme modesty, it would seem as 
if some credit for the extraordinary number of survivors of the crash is due to 
the safety regulations required by the FAA, and I'll be interested to learn 
what its investigation reveals. 
</P>
<P>
I think the media's reporting about this crash has improved over reporting 
about similar disasters of the past, but there remains too often, it seems to 
me, a tendency to think of design and maintenance as two distinct things. I 
know from personal experience that they are regarded in the aircraft industry 
as being so interrelated that the connection even has a name: maintainability. 
Unless I've missed it, I haven't even noticed the word being used. 
</P>
<P>
As I understand it, the maintainability of an airplane relates to the fact that 
for the plane to be maintained properly, it has to be engineered with its 
maintenance in mind.

AIRLINE CRASH IN SIOUX CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first heard, here in Los Angeles, the news of United Flight 232 crashing 
at the Sioux Gateway Airport, I was not sure whether it was scheduled to land 
there or only seeking a place to land. Then, my relief to learn that my 
hometown people were not killed was mingled with the sorrow for all those from 
Denver, Chicago, and beyond who were. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy of it all -- the feeling that if the wing of the DC-10 had not 
dipped into the ground for another 15 seconds they may have made it. 
</P>
<P>
The heroism of the passenger who heard a child crying in the smoke of the 
overturned fuselage, followed the sound of the crying through the smoke, and 
brought the child out to its parents. 
</P>
<P>
Pride that two years ago the people back home had staged just such an emergency 
so they would know better what to do if the real one came. The lives that were 
saved because they had taken the time and effort to do this. The many acts of 
kindness towards the victims and their families -- the acts that made the 
papers and presumably the hundreds that did not. 
</P>
<P>
The fragility of life, the preciousness of moments of life that God gives us, 
the consolation that life continues after death, hopefully a life better than 
the victims ever experienced here on earth. The realization that for more than 
100 human beings Flight 232 was a flight beyond this earthly life. Hopefully 
for them the Sioux Gateway Airport was the gateway to a better life. May they 
rest in peace.

The reason for this letter is to express my sorrow and grief for all the 
passengers and families of United Airlines Flight 232. I am presently a police 
officer for the city of Los Angeles, but I grew up and graduated high school in 
Sioux City, Iowa. When I heard about the residents of Sioux City lining up to 
donate blood, opening their homes to survivors, helping with the search for 
those unfortunate not to have made it and the many other tasks that needed to 
be done, a knot grew in my stomach. It made me proud to be from that city and 
state.

COUNTING ALIENS IN 1990 CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During my tenure as the vice chair of the Los Angeles City Task Force on 
Immigration that was created by the City Council in 1986, I took the 
opportunity to research the question of the indirect enfranchisement of aliens 
by counting them in the decennial U.S. census which determines the share of 
each state's seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. I found that the 
Constitutional Convention meeting in Philadelphia in 1787 determined that House 
representation be based on "one member for every forty thousand inhabitants." 
The Supreme Court has consistently maintained a definition that persons (such 
as in the "one person-one vote" decision of 1964) are to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the pronouncements of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), "alien" status was 
very much taken into consideration by the Founding Fathers. Alien status was no 
bar to voting privileges on state and national offices such as the President. 
During the 19th Century, 20 states permitted aliens to vote if they declared 
their intention to become citizens. During the 1890-1920 period alien suffrage 
was abolished as a reaction to the arrival of large numbers of non-Protestant 
immigrants. The last states to retain alien suffrage were Indiana (until 1921) 
and Arkansas (until the mid-1920s). 
</P>
<P>
Aliens, whether legal or illegal, pay taxes in the form of sales taxes and in 
the greater number of cases payroll and incomes taxes. By depriving them of 
representation, we as a nation would be reverting to the very thing that we 
rebelled against England for doing, that is, taxation without representation. 
</P>
<P>
All persons should be counted in the 1990 census. The requirement of singling 
out illegal aliens would deal a serious blow to the 1990 census. It may deprive 
the nation as a whole of the social and economic value and benefits that the 
$2.6-billion national people-counting effort can provide. Everybody is affected 
by the census and everyone should be counted.

I've read the articles and letters to the editor regarding the Supreme Court's

Give us all a break! There's a very easy way to stop all this nonsense and 
satisfy the pro- and anti-burners using laws that probably already are on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
If someone burns a flag he's arrested for either burning without a permit or 
polluting the air. In this way you can burn all the flags you want but you have 
to do it where there are no anti-open fire ordinances or no clean air 
regulations. Simple, everybody's satisfied.

FUTURE OF RAINBOW COALITION, NOT ETHICS PROBE, SHAPES TOM BRADLEY'S L.A. 
</P>

Los Angeles, which once was touted by city leaders as the "white spot of the 
nation" for its squeaky clean politics, now has earned the dubious distinction 
as the nation's "white-out" spot. Last week's allegation of a bungled cover-up 
by the city treasurer's office (the gang that couldn't white-out straight) to 
conceal Mayor Tom Bradley's alleged role in a controversial city bank deposit 
is only the latest in a litany of financial scandals rocking City Hall. The 
record over the past several years reveals an apparent ethical hemorrhaging -- 
charges of mismanagement and nepotism in the General Services Department, 
claims of influence-peddling by some former Bradley aides-turned-lobbyists, 
and, most serious of all, allegations of conflict of interest against Bradley 
himself in his dealings as a paid adviser to Far East National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Once dubbed the Teflon Mayor, Bradley finally appears to be losing his 
protective coating. The City Council, prodded by press revelations, is no 
longer automatically mayor-friendly. Council President John Ferraro and Finance 
and Revenue Committee Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky, both of whom have had their 
mayoral ambitions frustrated by Bradley's formidable re-election machine, have 
taken the lead on the council investigation into charges that Bradley sought 
special treatment for business associates. Even some staunch Bradley allies now 
concede the need for a full-fledged independent investigation of the mayor's 
troubled financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
With daily revelations of Bradley's mounting difficulties, Los Angeles may soon 
face the difficult political crossroads that insiders thought would be delayed 
until the 1993 election: the prospects of life in the post-Bradley era. The 
current controversy involves far more than the mayor's tangled financial 
relationships. Weighing in the balance are the larger accomplishments and 
failures of his 16-year Administration. 
</P>
<P>
First, the notable accomplishments. Under Bradley, Los Angeles has emerged as 
the nation's premier city for liberal, ethnic coalition politics. In 1973, a 
black/Jewish alliance elected Bradley, wresting power from the conservative Sam 
Yorty regime. Since then, Latinos and Asians have joined the Bradley alliance 
as junior partners. 
</P>
<P>
The city's long-lasting liberal rainbow coalition is remarkable in light of the 
experience of other big cities. In New York, Mayor Ed Koch has fractured the 
1960sliberal alliance of Jews, blacks and Latinos that killed efforts to 
maintain the corrupt Tammany Hall. That alliance elected reformer John Lindsay 
as mayor in 1965. In Chicago, the alliance of blacks, Latinos and white 
liberals that elected black reformer Harold Washington mayor in 1983 proved to 
be short-lived. This year, a victorious Richard M. Daley, son of the late 
mayor, drew disaffected white liberals and Latinos into his camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley achievement of ethnic inclusion is even more remarkable in light of 
Los Angeles' entrenched WASP power structure. A staunchly conservative downtown 
business Establishment firmly ruled the city from the late 19th Century into 
the 1960s, waging a successful century-long campaign against liberals, 
Democrats, minorities and organized labor. Like Daniel in the lions's den, 
Bradley soothed the skeptical business community with an ambitious plan for 
downtown redevelopment. Soon the Establishment applied for full partnership in 
the Bradley coalition. 
</P>
<P>
To succeed in liberalizing the city's politics, Bradley also had to combat Los 
Angeles' decentralized governmental structure that had placed an inordinate 
amount of power in the hands of conservative City Council members and unelected 
administrators. The mayor carefully placed his liberal proteges on the council, 
enlisting them as allies in an attack on the entrenched city bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
The fruits of Bradley's campaign to place power in the hands of elected 
officials were manifold -- an aggressive strategy to secure federal grants both 
to rebuild the decaying downtown area and to deliver needed social services to 
the city's minority groups; the appointment of minorities and women to top 
administrative posts; increased minority hiring in municipal employment and 
contracting, and greater civilian control over the police. Despite his 
impassive demeanor and seemingly cautious style, the mayor quietly yet 
courageously captured and transformed a hostile city government. Los Angeles 
will never be the same again because of Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
However, these impressive accomplishments have to be balanced against the 
arguable failures of the Bradley era. To many critics, the mayor's growth 
policies have produced class polarization and ethnic Balkanization. Developers 
have been pitted against neighborhood residents, rich pitted against poor and 
ethnic groups turned against one another as federal funding has dried up. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Bradley survives the current crisis, demographic and economic trends 
threaten Los Angeles' version of the rainbow coalition. The Latino and Asian 
populations, today's junior partners, are rapidly growing while the black and 
Jewish populations, its senior partners, have leveled off. At the same time, 
the city's class and ethnic dividing lines are hardening. Jews and Asians are 
riding the waves of Pacific Rim prosperity while many blacks and Latinos 
constitute a growing underclass trapped by a low-paying service economy. The 
game of ethnic musical chairs will accelerate as Latinos and Asians seek a 
greater voice in the city's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The financial scandal dominating today's local political headlines obscures 
these underlying fissures in the city's governing ethnic alliance, first 
revealed in the mayor's surprisingly narrow 1989 reelection victory. For 
Bradley, his possible successors and the city's voters, the big, long-term 
question is not so much about financial mismanagement in City Hall but the 
survivability of the rainbow coalition that brought the city its most 
noteworthy success.

COMMUNITY ALLOTTED AN OFFICIAL 3RD WORD 
</P>

<P>
Is the community above Hansen Dam known as Lakeview Terrace or Lake View 
Terrace? 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council ended the confusion Tuesday. The name, which often 
appears on city reports and correspondence, is now officially Lake View Terrace 
-- that's three words, all beginning with capital letters. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the community, said in a motion that 
city records and maps show that the community is three words, not two, and 
ordered that all further references be accurate.

BURBANK AIRPORT CLEARED TO APPLY FOR NOISE-RELIEF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has given Burbank Airport approval to apply 
for funds to soundproof nearby homes and schools as part of a long-range 
noise-relief program, airport officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a significant accomplishment," said Thomas Greer, director of 
airport services. "We feel real good that we've gotten to this point." 
</P>
<P>
Some area residents, however, said that they oppose the noise-relief plan 
altogether because they believe it will encourage airport officials to expand 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Solution' 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely not a solution" to the noise problems, said Wally Berns, 
leader of the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA notified the airport Monday of its eligibility for the federal funds, 
Greer said. The FAA's decision was based on a noise study that concluded that 
the airport should spend about $50 million to soundproof 2,300 homes and four 
schools in the surrounding area, Greer said. The money also could be used to 
buy some or all of 54 homes adjacent to the airport, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Victor Gill said the airport will apply for federal money for 
specific projects on a year-to-year basis over the next 10 years to implement 
the noise-relief program. He cautioned homeowners to be patient, saying Burbank 
Airport must compete with 185 other airports across the country for the same 
money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encourage Expansion 
</P>
<P>
Berns said such a plan would encourage future expansion of the airport. "All 
this is a ploy by the airport to take away any threat of future lawsuits," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would rather see the airport limit the number of flights and change 
its flight patterns to share the noise with other area residents. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials maintain that they cannot legally restrict the number of 
airlines using the airport. They said pilots oppose changing flight patterns 
for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This fight is just starting," Berns said. "It's going to be a never-ending 
battle."

VOTE DELAYED ON ANTONOVICH PLAN TO ENFORCE LIMITS ON LOPEZ DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with defeat, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Tuesday 
postponed a vote on his proposal to pressure the city of Los Angeles to close 
Lopez Canyon Landfill within 30 days if violations are not corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's motion to force Los Angeles to reduce dumping at its Lake View 
Terrace landfill was enthusiastically endorsed by the area's homeowner groups. 
But two supervisors, Kenneth Hahn and Deane Dana, said they would vote against 
the measure, and Ed Edelman said he was leaning against it too. The remaining 
supervisor, Pete Schabarum, who was not at the board meeting, has indicated 
that he opposes the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, who postponed the vote until next Tuesday's meeting, wants the 
county to enforce a state order that instructs the city to decrease the number 
of trash trucks entering the landfill to no more than 400 daily and to restrict 
dumping to 140 acres at the 392-acre site. The California Waste Management 
Board claims that the city is violating its landfill permit by processing more 
waste than authorized. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the county Department of Health Services, which acts as the state's 
local enforcement arm, gave the city until mid-September to either close the 
dump, issue a plan detailing how it would comply with the new restrictions or 
apply for a new permit. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're asking the city of Los Angeles to do is abide by the law," 
Antonovich said. "We can't become a partner to the city by turning a blind 
eye." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Oppose Crackdown 
</P>
<P>
But some supervisors said they oppose a crackdown because Lopez, which receives 
two-thirds of the city's residential trash, is the only city dump within Los 
Angeles. They fear that a closure would divert Los Angeles' trash to landfills 
elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a dilemma here in Los Angeles," Hahn said. "Trash is piling up. We 
have trash to dispose of; we have to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn. representative claimed 
that Antonovich's colleagues were motivated by parochial concerns. He said the 
county has not closed the city dump because it fears that landfills in the 
county would fill up quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sorry to see this indication that the board doesn't want to take a 
leadership position," said Lewis Snow, the group's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
But Ralph Lopez, county deputy director of environmental health, said the 
county is not guilty of foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem as of now is there is no significant public health threat," Lopez 
said. Therefore, he said, "we're not willing to come in and close it down 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
The dump's fate most likely will be decided in court. On Sept. 26, a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge will hold a hearing on the city's lawsuit opposing 
the state's restrictions.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BROTHER-IN-LAW SOUGHT IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Val Verde man opened fire from a stopped car Tuesday and fatally shot his 
brother-in-law, who was in a parked pickup truck next to the car, the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Arnulfo Herrera, 50, of Val Verde died at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital 
in Valencia several hours after the 5 p.m. shooting, Sgt. Jim Curtis said. 
Herrera was shot three times in the upper body, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were searching for Juan Jose Sanchez Luviano, 23, the suspected 
gunman. Sanchez is believed to have fired at least five rounds at the pickup 
truck parked at San Martinez Road and Concorse Drive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told authorities that Sanchez walked across the street to the Val 
Verde General Store, where he collapsed. Curtis said the shooting grew out of 
an unspecified family dispute.8/02/89

BLUE CROSS, REALTY FIRM AGREE TO DEVELOP 32-ACRE WARNER SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blue Cross of California said Tuesday that it has reached a tentative agreement 
to join with a Chicago real estate concern to jointly develop the 32 acres 
surrounding Blue Cross' headquarters in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The land, which has grassy open space, trees and parking lots in addition to 
Blue Cross' 14-story headquarters, is in the Warner Center area and is bordered 
by Oxnard Street, Canoga Avenue, Erwin Street and Owensmouth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross, one of the state's largest health insurers, plans to develop the 
land with an affiliate of JMB Realty Corp., a major real estate investment firm 
that already owns Blue Cross' headquarters building and eight surrounding 
acres. Blue Cross owns the remaining 24 acres of land. 
</P>
<P>
The companies did not release terms of their agreement and said that plans for 
developing the property are still being decided. But they indicated that their 
plans would extend the office, residential and retail development that already 
distinguishes Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross' announcement came after the company spent nearly a year mulling 
proposals from 19 companies seeking to develop the property, said spokeswoman 
Jeannette M. Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Density Concerns 
</P>
<P>
When Blue Cross said last year that it would entertain bids, some local 
homeowners expressed concern about increased density and traffic in Warner 
Center. In a statement Tuesday, Blue Cross President Leonard D. Schaeffer said 
any Blue Cross/JMB development would occur after "thorough consideration of the 
impact on the neighborhood as well as the company." 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross' decision to help develop the land underscored how the company's 
recent financial problems have been abating, allowing the company to avoid 
having to sell the land quickly to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Blue Cross lost $9.1 million, contrasted with a $56-million loss the 
previous year. And in this year's first quarter, Blue Cross earned a $700,000 
profit, compared to a loss of $31.1 million over the same period in 1988.

COUNTY AGREES TO END SANTA CLARITA FIRE FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita and Los Angeles County ended a year of haggling by settling a 
dispute over fire protection fees that the young city claimed were unnecessary 
and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp said Tuesday that county officials have 
decided that they will no longer charge Santa Clarita $408,000 a year to fight 
fires in brush and open areas of the city. The county halted the fees as of 
July 1, Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The city had maintained that the fees were unnecessary because the county's 
Consolidated Fire District already collects millions of dollars in property 
taxes from Santa Clarita. Last year, for example, the taxes generated $6.5 
million for the fire district, Pulskamp said. "We were concerned we were paying 
too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, unhappy with the fees, explored forming its own fire 
department this year to save money. But with the dispute resolved, there are no 
plans to create one, Pulskamp said. Council members have said they are pleased 
with the service that the Consolidated Fire District provides Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Conflict 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the fees was the tail end of an earlier financial conflict 
between Santa Clarita and the county. In that dispute, the City Council balked 
at reimbursing the county for about $2.7 million in services that the county 
provided after the city incorporated on Dec. 15, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood proponents had promised to pay the $2.7 million, but members of the 
City Council later questioned whether they were bound by the promises of the 
incorporation committee. 
</P>
<P>
That decision prompted county supervisors to lambaste one council member at a 
public hearing. The supervisors sternly warned Councilman Dennis Koontz that 
Santa Clarita would have a hard time winning favors from the county in the 
future if it did not pay the fees. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county finally settled that dispute in June, 1988, when Santa 
Clarita agreed to reimburse the $2.7 million. As part of that agreement, the 
county reduced the wild land fire fees to $560,000, about half of what the city 
had been charged. The fee was later reduced to $408,000.

BURBANK HATCHET JOB? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Burbank's Rancho area said a private tree-trimming company hired 
by the city butchered neighborhood trees to make room for a power line. 
</P>
<P>
Trees were cut into flat-top and V-shaped forms, Burbank electric services 
manager Greg Simay said. Most of the trimmed trees are along a four-block 
stretch of Parkside Avenue, with some trees along Mariposa Street and 
Morningside Drive also cut. 
</P>
<P>
Simay said two people have complained to the city about the trimming. In 
response, City Councilman Michael Hastings has proposed that the city review 
its tree-trimming policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much that the job needs to be done, it's how it's being done," 
said Jim Vorhees, a Mariposa Street resident who also is a member of the 
Burbank Civic Pride Committee. "It's just a hatchet job." 
</P>
<P>
The trimming was needed to create a five-foot clearance for a 4,000-volt power 
line along Parkside Avenue, Simay said.

SPITTIN' IMAGE;

<P>
IF GAYLORD PERRY WAS ALL WET, WHY THE CY YOUNGS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems safe to say that Gaylord Perry threw an occasional spitter when he was 
mesmerizing rival batters, but so what? 
</P>
<P>
Those who dwell on the question of whether Perry moistened the baseball ignore 
the fact that he was a pitcher who someday might be in the Hall of Fame. Also, 
he was never caught with an illegal substance. 
</P>
<P>
Spitter or no spitter, Perry won 314 games in 22 years with eight clubs in the 
major leagues, and he had one of his greatest seasons with the Padres in 1978. 
At the age of 40, he became the only pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Six years earlier, when he was with the Cleveland Indians, Perry earned the 
award in the American League. He did it with a career-high 24 victories -- 
against 16 defeats -- and a career-low earned-run average of 1.92. 
</P>
<P>
With the Padres, in his first of two seasons here after coming over from the 
Texas Rangers, Perry did a rerun in the National League with a won-lost record 
of 21-6 and an ERA of 2.72. 
</P>
<P>
Perry never again won more than 12 games in a season -- he was 12-11 with the 
Padres in 1979 -- before finally retiring at the age of 45. But in that one 
last big year, he was dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched all season on just three days' rest, which almost nobody does today, 
but got stronger as he went along. He finished with a six-game winning streak 
and topped off the season by joining the 3,000-strikeout club on the last day. 
He was only the third pitcher to reach that milestone, following Walter Johnson 
and Bob Gibson, and when he got there, the fans cheered until he made a curtain 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Now 50 -- he will turn 51 on Sept. 15 -- Perry is the baseball coach at 
Limestone College in Gaffney, S.C. One of his players is his son, Jack, a 
6-foot-8 left-hander with a dream of following in his father's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
Perry looked back to his second Cy Young season after the recent Equitable 
Old-Timers game in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the first one in a way," he said. "In '72, I had just been traded 
from San Francisco to Cleveland. In '78, I had just been traded from Texas to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was really a great experience in San Diego. The fact that I was still 
able to pitch that well when I was 40 was very satisfying. Probably the 
greatest thing I had going for me was having Rollie Fingers in the bullpen. I 
think he saved 14 or 15 of my 21 wins." 
</P>
<P>
Fingers, who lives in El Cajon, actually earned only 10 of his league-leading 
37 saves on behalf of Perry. John D'Aquisto saved three, Bob Shirley and Mickey 
Lolich one each. 
</P>
<P>
Fingers also finished an 11th game for Perry, but didn't get a save in that 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Note, then, that Perry pitched only five complete games in 37 starts. In his 
other Cy Young season, he completed a career-high 29 of 40 starts. 
</P>
<P>
But times changed in the interim. By 1978, relief specialists were being relied 
on to the extent that managers sent for them at the first sign of trouble in 
the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
As Perry put it during that season, "It's hard for our starters to pitch 
complete games, because we have such a good bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Perry's five complete games were shutouts. Three of his six defeats were 
by scores of 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2. In five of the six consecutive victories with 
which he ended the season, he gave up just six runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had a big September," he said. "I always had a good September. I 
wound it up the right way, and that put me up front in the (Cy Young) voting. I 
figured if I had a good September, I had a good chance to win it. There was 
nobody right behind me to sneak up on me." 
</P>
<P>
Perry had pitched a no-hit game for San Francisco in 1968, but another Cy Young 
Award was more appealing to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning a second Cy Young," he said after the 1978 finale, "would mean even 
more to me than my no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, he won in a landslide. He received 22 of 24 first-place votes 
from a panel of sportswriters, the two others going to Burt Hooton of the 
Dodgers. He totaled 116 points to Hooton's 38. 
</P>
<P>
Perry was the oldest winner and when he got the good news, he said, "I'm 
dedicating this to all the people 40 or over. It was exciting when I won the 
first time, but this has more power and pleasure in it. This time I was 40, and 
it was the first time the Padres had played .500 ball or better (84-78)." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had used his much-publicized spitter, Perry dodged the issue by 
saying, "I kept the slippery pitch ready all season, thinking they would 
probably legalize it sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
Perry added, "I hope I'll be part of the San Diego franchise for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
But he was gone less than a year later. He abruptly left the Padres on Sept. 5, 
1979, drew a suspension for the remainder of the season and subsequently was 
traded back to the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in Anaheim why he had jumped the club, Perry said, "I went home." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to elaborate, he said, "For personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of September, Perry had been told by Manager Roger Craig, now 
manager of the Giants, that the Padres wanted to start rookies called up from 
the minor leagues in the final month. Perry didn't relish sitting and watching, 
so he packed up and left. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery, the Padres' veteran utility infielder, recalled that he reached 
San Diego just as Perry was departing. 
</P>
<P>
"The last game he pitched was my first game," Flannery said. "I was just up 
from the minors, and I played second base. To me, it was an honor to play 
behind such a great pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys said at that time that if you made an error behind him, he would turn 
around and scream at you. Fortunately, I had just one fielding chance, a popup 
for the last out, and I'm sure he had something to do with that. Ozzie Smith 
was our shortstop, and Perry had such great control that he made practically 
everybody hit to the left side. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, he left to work on his peanut farm." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, now with St. Louis, confirmed Flannery's testimony about Perry's 
impeccable control. Smith was a rookie, just a year out of Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, when Perry won his second Cy Young award. 
</P>
<P>
"Perry had the uncanny ability of getting them to hit the ball to me," Smith 
said. "He would turn around to me and motion to go into the hole because he was 
going to pitch a guy a different way from what our scouting report said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just phenomenal. The man was a master tactician. He was like a surgeon. 
He definitely helped my career. He knew how to utilize his infielders to the 
best of their ability, and that allowed me to utilize what had gotten me here." 
</P>
<P>
Padre broadcaster Jerry Coleman said of Perry, "He was the only pitcher who 
could be behind a hitter three-oh and actually be ahead in the count. He'd 
throw a fastball down the middle, and it would be three-one. On the next one, 
the guy would be looking for another fastball, and he'd get a curve that made 
it three-two. Now it was one on one, and Perry would throw one of his other 
pitches and the hitter was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman added that as fine a pitcher as Perry was, he was never fully 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserves to be in the Hall of Fame," Coleman said. "He was one of the great 
pitchers of our generation. He was smart, and that's better than good. Smart 
people find a way to win. Good people find a way to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"But he was not a lovable person, so I don't think he was a fan favorite. He 
didn't have charisma." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Nelson, a Chicago Cubs broadcaster, recalled Perry as first a rival and 
then a teammate in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"Gaylord was one of the fiercest competitors I ever played with or against," 
Nelson said. "One time I bunted on him and stole a base, so the next time he 
threw at my head and hit me in the elbow. I went to first base and stole second 
again, and he stared at me. 
</P>
<P>
"The next year, he was with me in Texas. I said, 'Welcome aboard,' and he said 
to me, 'I've got to give you credit. You're a spunky little guy.' 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that I didn't like the guy. I just didn't like what he did." 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson of the Cubs, who played against Perry the Padre as a member of the 
Montreal Expos, recalled that he had more trouble with Perry's breaking pitches 
-- his legitimate ones -- than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw me a lot of off-speed stuff," Dawson said. "He got ahead of you and 
made you hit his pitch. I guess he only threw in the low 80s, but he spotted 
his fastball very cleverly, and he complemented it with his off-speed pitches. 
He kept me off balance most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Perry's pitching repertoire included just about everything: a fastball, a hard 
slider, a forkball, a changeup, curves thrown at different speeds. Then there 
was the spitter, alleged or otherwise, which over the years came to be known as 
a greaseball. 
</P>
<P>
One instance in which he was punished still did not prove conclusively that he 
was throwing spitters. He was suspended for 10 days and fined $250 in August 
1982 after umpire Dave Phillips ruled that he had doctored baseballs he threw 
against Boston while with the Seattle Mariners. American League President Lee 
MacPhail upheld the suspension, but no foreign substance was found. 
</P>
<P>
And so the question remained: Did he or didn't he? Remarks by Padre broadcaster 
Rick Monday, who played against Perry as an outfielder with the Dodgers, seem 
typical. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no controversy," Monday said. "He threw a spitter. I know exactly 
how he did it: very well. He didn't throw me many, because a spitter breaks 
down, and I was a low-ball hitter, but he didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
"All he had to do was put doubt in the hitters' minds. He seemed to take great 
delight in watching people's reactions to whether he might or might not be 
altering the baseball." 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of other comments: 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton, who played against Perry as a Cardinal before being traded to 
the Padres for Smith: "I know he wetted it up, because he threw some pitches 
that did weird stuff. If he was in a critical situation, you knew you were 
going to get the wet one. It would knuckle up there and fall down. He used it 
at least twice in every at-bat, and he knew he could get you out with it. But 
I'll say this: He was the best I've ever seen at disguising it." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson: "Lord knows where he got the wet stuff from, but he was an expert at 
loading up. He would get it off his hair, his neck, wherever. In his later 
years, he went to it more and more often. It got to the point where he messed 
up everybody's minds." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman: "He spotted the spitter very cleverly. He loved to tease hitters with 
it, and he used it as a psychological ploy. It was the specter of it that 
really made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager: "Everybody knew he was throwing it, but he was too 
slick for anybody to catch him. I think his other talents were diminished in 
people's minds by all the talk about his spitter." 
</P>
<P>
Two other managers, Jack McKeon of the Padres and Don Zimmer of the Cubs, said 
they played down the subject to their players when their clubs faced Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Said McKeon: "I told my players (in Kansas City), 'If you start going up there 
looking for that stuff, you'll get yourself out.' " 
</P>
<P>
And Zimmer: "Why bother? They don't do nothing about it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, Monday and Templeton called attention to the fact that, on occasion, 
Perry also threw what could best be described as a puff ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pitch you don't hear much about," Monday said. "He would hold the 
resin bag in his hand for what seemed like forever, and when he threw the ball, 
you'd see what looked like a big puff of smoke." 
</P>
<P>
But the spitter was Perry's trademark, and he traded on his reputation to the 
fullest. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept them guessing every chance I got," he said. "I made them believe I 
threw a spitter. Making them think I did was a big advantage to me."

AGASSI BREEZES; NOAH STRUGGLES AND TALKS RETIREMENT 
</P>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Defending champion Andre Agassi defeated Glenn Michibata of Canada, 6-2, 6-2, 
and Yannick Noah survived a match point before downing Jeremy Bates of Britain, 
4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2, in the opening round of the Volvo International tennis 
tournament Tuesday at Stratton Mountain, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
After his match, Noah said he may retire after the U.S. Open in September. Noah 
was ranked as high as No. 3 in the world in 1986, but has been plagued by 
injuries since then and fallen to 25th. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to play some semifinals and finals, but struggling in the first round 
isn't much fun," said Noah, who hasn't won a title this year. 
</P>
<P>
When he does stop playing, Noah said he plans to sail around the world for 
several years and then return to school. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly what I'm going to learn, but I'm definitely going to go 
back and spend some time learning more about philosophy or some religions," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Noah rallied after falling behind 4-2 in the second-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just had it, and then came back and won," he said. "In a tiebreaker 
anything can happen and I was happy I won it." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, 19, spent more time talking about his reputation than his victory over 
Michibata. Agassi, of Las Vegas, has failed to win a tournament this year after 
capturing six titles last year, and his flamboyant style has been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said reporters have taken his comments out of context and made him look 
like "I'm some sort of egotistical maniac." 
</P>
<P>
"It really made you question whether it was really worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bettina Bunge, once ranked sixth in the world, returned to singles play for the 
first time since 1987 and defeated No. 5-seeded Lori McNeil, 6-2, 6-0, in the 
$200,000 Great American Bank tournament at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Bunge outplayed McNeil in making her comeback from the knee and foot injuries 
that sidelined her for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
While McNeil became the third seeded player to fall in the opening round, No. 
2-seeded Zina Garrison prevailed over Jenny Byrne, 6-1, 7-5, in another first 
round match. 
</P>
<P>
In a second-round match, top-ranked Steffi Graf defeated Betsy Nagelsen, 6-1, 
6-1, in 43 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bunge, who had her top ranking in 1983, returned to doubles competition in 
March before trying singles against McNeil, who is ranked 24th. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly a nice surprise, but one match isn't enough to tell you 'yes 
or no,' " said Bunge, who lives in Monaco. "It is a period of tests. It would 
be naive to say otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Kent Carlsson of Sweden overcame a second-set lapse to 
defeat Diego Perez of Uruguay, 7-5, 1-6, 6-2, and move into the second round of 
the $350,000 Austrian Open tennis tournament at Kitzbuhel, Austria.

MORNING BRIEFING: THESE FANTASY CAMPS PROVIDE MUCH GLITTER, LITTLE SUBSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have you signed up for one of those summer sports camps at which you get to 
meet and learn from great athletes? There's still time, and Tony Kornheiser of 
the Washington Post has made up a list. Here are a few: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Andre Agassi's Ultimate Garbo Camp: Achieve a top-five ranking without 
ever playing a tournament. You'll have all the free time you need to do your 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Sugar Ray Leonard Camp: For adults 50 and up. Box with people at least 20 
years older than you until ultimately you go 10 rounds (or less) with Irving 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Ralph Sampson Fantasy Basketball Camp: A highly specialized camp open only 
to 7-footers who want to be point guards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Ben Johnson Sprint Camp: Do whatever you want. Nobody will check up on 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Only in Hollywood: Dallas running back Herschel Walker has a role in the HBO 
series "First and Ten," scheduled for fall release. In one scene, Walker is 
involved in a barroom brawl. Walker doesn't drink. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was asked once if he wasn't even curious about taking a drink. He said, 
"I'm curious about jumping off a cliff, and I don't do that either." 
</P>
<P>
Add Cowboys: In the August edition of Esquire, Coach Buddy Ryan of the 
Philadelphia Eagles takes a dim view of Jimmy Johnson's chances to make Dallas 
a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan: "You want to win in this man's league, you find yourself a good NFL 
assistant." 
</P>
<P>
And he relayed a message to Johnson through Cowboy linebacker Garry Cobb, a 
former Eagle: "Tell your coach there ain't no University of Cincinnati up here 
in this league. Ain't no East Carolina, either." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What two Olympic middleweight boxing champions went on to win 
world heavyweight titles? 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it-Dept. The men who hold the major league records for most 
home runs, triples and doubles in a season never approached those totals before 
or after those seasons. Roger Maris' next-best total after his 61 homers was 
39. Owen Wilson's next best after 36 triples was 14. Earl Webb's next best 
after 67 doubles was 30. Wilson set his mark for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 
1912, Webb for the Boston Red Sox in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's record looks to be the toughest to break. The marks of Maris and Webb 
have been approached, but the closest to Wilson is 26 triples, by three men, 
one of them Shoeless Joe Jackson. Last year's leaders were Andy Van Slyke of 
Pittsburgh (15) in the National League and Harold Reynolds of Seattle, Willie 
Wilson of Kansas City and Robin Yount of Milwaukee (11) in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Anchors aweigh: After a San Antonio Spurs' intra-squad game, in which David 
Robinson had 31 points, 17 rebounds and 11 blocked shots, General Manager Bob 
Bass told Jan Hubbard of Newsday: "No big man has ever been like this. Nobody. 
Name even a 6-9 guy with that quickness. I tell you, James Worthy can't run 
like David." 
</P>
<P>
Said Spur guard Willie Anderson: "Right now he could step into the league and 
be the best center except two, Akeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing. And that's 
only because they have more experience. Given time, he'll be the best there's 
ever been." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Floyd Patterson, 1952, and Michael Spinks, 1976.Quotebook: 
Reggie Williams, Cincinnati Bengal linebacker, asked his attributes: "Speed, 
strength and the ability to recognize pain immediately."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ORIOLE LEAD DOWN TO ONE AFTER A DOUBLE DEFEAT BY RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 7 1/2-game lead the Baltimore Orioles had in the American League East when 
they headed West less than two weeks ago is almost gone. 
</P>
<P>
The margin fell to a game Tuesday at Boston when they lost a day-night 
doubleheader. In the first game Ellis Burks, just off the disabled list, 
snapped a seventh-inning tie with a double and the Red Sox won, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Esasky hit a three-run home run in the second game to lead the Red Sox to 
a 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Since July 20, when the Orioles opened a 14-game trip in Oakland, the Red Sox 
are only 8-6. However, they have gained seven games to pull within a game 
because the Orioles are 1-13 in their last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who lost their last home game before the trip, play the Red Sox 
again tonight, so they could be out of the lead when they head home. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone has closed in on the collapsing Orioles. The Yankees, who have lost 11 
of their last 14, are in sixth place, but only five games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
In the last nine games, the Orioles' starting pitchers have an earned-run 
average of 7.60. The hitters went into a slump even earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't happen overnight, " Manager Frank Robinson said, "but it's been in a 
very short period of time. It's tough to believe we're playing the way we've 
been playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Every game I think we're going back to the way we're capable of playing. Then 
after each game we come back and say, 'Well maybe the next one.' It's not going 
to go away until we make it go away." 
</P>
<P>
Burks, who had shoulder surgery in mid-June, learned Monday night in Toledo, 
where he was undergoing rehabilitation, that he had been activated. He was 
elated to get back. 
</P>
<P>
"I arrived a couple of hours before the day game," he said. "But I was ready. 
I'm a little tired, but I'm excited about being in a pennant race." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Rob Murphy won the opener, and Wes Gardner gave up five hits in 7 2/3 
innings in the second game to improve his record to 3-6. Lee Smith got a save 
in each game. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 2, Chicago 0 -- With the Angels losing again at Seattle, the Athletics 
moved back into first place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Young, who had failed in seven consecutive starts, and three relievers 
combined for a six-hitter at Oakland. Young (3-8) gave up four hits in six 
innings to win for the first time since May 28. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Eckersley pitched the ninth for his 19th save in 21 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Jose doubled in a run in the second inning off Greg Hibbard. In the 
eighth, Carney Lansford singled in the other run as the Athletics won for the 
10th time in the last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Cleveland 2 -- Robin Yount continues to carry the Brewers into the 
thick of the Eastern Division race. 
</P>
<P>
With the Brewers trailing, 2-1, in the eighth inning at Milwaukee, Yount, who 
has hit safely in 21 of his last 22 games, rammed a two-run double and the 
Brewers won for the 10th time in 13 games. From 12 games back they have closed 
to within 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter, snapping out of a three-for-29 slump, hit his 21st homer in the 
seventh to give the Indians their 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 2, Toronto 1 -- Count right-hander Bret Saberhagen as one who 
thinks Toronto's SkyDome is out of this universe. 
</P>
<P>
After pitching a three-hitter for his eighth win in his last nine decisions, 
Saberhagen (11-5) said: "This place is great. It's like something out of 2001." 
</P>
<P>
In his last five games at the old park Saberhagen was a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, New York 4 -- The pitching problems continue for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Terrell had another rough outing at New York. One of the many pitchers the 
Yankees have acquired from the San Diego Padres, the veteran right-hander was 
out after 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell gave up a two-run home run to Randy Bush that put the Twins ahead to 
stay. It was the Yankees' 11th loss in the last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly provided most of the Yankee offense. He hit his 14th home run, 
singled twice and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 4, Detroit 3 -- When the Rangers acquired Harold Baines they were 
criticized for adding a hitter instead needed pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Bobby Valentine's answer was that the Rangers needed a designated 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Their new designated hitter came through with a flourish at Detroit. With one 
out in the ninth inning and the Tigers leading, 3-2, Cecil Espy fouled off nine 
pitches, then hammered a double off the right-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
Baines hit the next pitch into the second deck for his 14th home run, his first 
as a Ranger, to win the game. DAN HAFNER

DE LA MAZA SUPPLIES A LAST LAUGH IN LAST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Elling 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though Panorama City lost a doubleheader Saturday -- including a lopsided 
15-7 loss to Santa Monica in the second game -- and was eliminated from the 
Area 6 playoffs, there were more than a few laughs coming from the Panorama 
City dugout as the season came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them were directed at catcher Roland De La Maza. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher? 
</P>
<P>
 De La Maza, regarded as one of the best right-handed pitchers and outfielders 
in District 20, caught the top of the ninth inning, and it fast became a 
season's worth of adventure rolled into three outs. There was a stolen base. 
There were three wild pitches. Three runs scored to give Santa Monica the final 
margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the highlight, if you will, came when Panorama City pitcher Carlos Concha 
fired a high fastball that landed squarely in the middle of De La Maza's glove 
-- and bounced straight up, almost like a popup. 
</P>
<P>
Like a true pro, De La Maza instantly whipped off the mask. He looked left. He 
looked right. And the ball came straight down and hit him in the backside as 
his teammates roared. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't exactly turn out as he had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"When he went in, he was saying how nobody was going to run on him and how we 
were going to shut them down," teammate Sean Henson said. "He said he wanted to 
let somebody get on base just so he could throw them out." 
</P>
<P>
A better way: The father of Woodland Hills West pitcher Lance Gibson has 
invented a new verb to describe his son's summertime recovery from a March 
shoulder operation. Gary Gibson, also the West coach, calls it "rehabing." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, after improving to 9-1 this season with his win over Santa Monica, Lance 
said that what began as rehabilitation has turned into something more 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really going to use Legion as a time to rehabilitate my arm, but I got 
lucky when I got on a team that loves to win as much as this one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With two wins in the Area 6 playoffs, the 6-foot-4 right-hander raised his 
three-year Legion record to 22-3. In his past three starts, spanning 25 
innings, Gibson has allowed two earned runs. In his two Area 6 victories, 
Gibson struck out 17, walked four and allowed 12 hits in 17 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Instant boon: West's Del Marine can attest to the fact that batting behind Ryan 
McGuire has its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, the state sophomore player of the year in 1988, was five for 13 and 
drove in four runs in four games in the Area 6 playoffs. Marine, batting fourth 
behind McGuire, was seven for 15 with six runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, however, walked seven times in the tournament. In Sunday's win over 
Santa Monica, McGuire twice was walked intentionally with first base open. On 
the first occasion, a West baserunner was thrown out to end the inning. The 
second time, Marine singled to right -- on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
And this after Santa Monica had ample opportunity to scout West during the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe they walked Ryan to get to Del," Gary Gibson said. "Del's 
definitely our best hitter right now." 
</P>
<P>
He may be right. Overall, Marine is 44 for 97 (.453) with a team-high 34 RBIs. 
McGuire is 35 for 84 (.417) with 30 RBIs. Of course, with all the walks McGuire 
has received, there's usually somebody aboard when Marine bats. 
</P>
<P>
One-upsmanship: Before West's championship game against Santa Monica, Gibson, 
the starting pitcher, approached catcher Bobby Kim and placed an order. Kim 
made a counteroffer. As it turns out, both got more than they asked for. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a bet going before the game," Kim said. "Lance said, 'Give me four runs 
and I'll win it.' So I said, 'Give me 10 strikeouts and one walk, and we will.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The team scored nine runs. Gibson struck out 11 and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Up in smoke: Even though he coaches a West team that is 27-3, baseball is still 
a nervous proposition for Gary Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll walk out to the mound every once in a while just to ask if everything's 
OK," said Lance Gibson, the coach's son. "I just say, 'Relax, we'll come 
through.' I think all of the coaches will probably have ulcers before we're 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Back up the antacid delivery truck. West opens play in the state playoffs, a 
six-team, double-elimination tournament, Saturday at 9:30 a.m. in Yountville, 
Calif. If West wins the state title, it will open play in a regional tournament 
starting Aug. 16 in Union City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place team in the state tournament advances to a runner-up regional, 
which begins Aug. 16 in Lewiston, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
Mother knows best?: When Panorama City outfielder Sean Henson stepped to the 
plate in a 15-7 loss to Santa Monica in an Area 6 elimination game Saturday, 
his mom, Toni, nearly fell out of her lawn chair. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she questioned aloud why Sean -- normally a starting pitcher -- was in 
the lineup at all, since hitting has never been his bread and butter. Three 
hours later, she ate her words. 
</P>
<P>
Henson went four for four, and the only time he didn't hit safely he walked 
with the bases loaded to force in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Hot and cold: District 16 champion Westlake-Agoura (28-5-4) was eliminated from 
the Area 6 playoffs in short order, losing to Woodland Hills West, 10-0, and 
Panorama City, 12-3. Infielder Mike Suarez, however, went down kicking and 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez, who entered the playoffs batting a team-high .416, was four for seven 
and reached base six times in eight plate appearances as the leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Mike Lieberthal, Brian Smith and Todd Preston -- the Nos. 3, 4, 5 
hitters -- were a combined three for 20 with one RBI. Lieberthal, who entered 
the playoffs with 12 home runs and 51 RBIs, was hitless in seven at-bats, 
struck out three times and grounded into a double play.

<P>
LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR HART FOOTBALL JOB DWINDLES TO 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of candidates for the vacant Hart High football job was narrowed to 
two Tuesday after interim Coach Tim Azevedo and Bill Redell, a former coach at 
Crespi, withdrew as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Left in the hunt to replace Dave Carson, who was forced to resign July 20, are 
Bellflower Coach Mike Herrington, a former Hart assistant, and Chuck Lyon, an 
assistant at Pasadena City College. Hart Principal Laurence Strauss said that 
he wants to select a coach by Thursday, the last day of the team's summer 
schedule. Southern Section teams can begin two-a-day drills Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Timing is the reason Azevedo, 31, has withdrawn as a candidate, he said. He was 
the team's defensive coordinator last season and will serve as interim coach 
until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good school and the job is a great opportunity, but the time crunch 
doesn't make it a good career move for me," Azevedo said. "I don't want my ego 
of wanting to be a head coach to get in the way of making a smart decision." 
</P>
<P>
Redell, who coached at Crespi for five seasons through last fall, said that 
conflicts with his job as an insurance salesman prohibited him from taking the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to do it because it's one of the top two or three programs 
in the San Fernando Valley," he said. "With me commuting an hour there and back 
and devoting time to my business, I wouldn't be fair to the program. They need 
a coach on a full-time basis who will be on campus." 
</P>
<P>
It might be difficult for Hart to find an on-campus coach. Strauss said the 
school has no openings for a physical education teacher and that he might hire 
a walk-on coach. Carson, who teaches physical education and health classes, 
will be retained by the school for at least one year. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington and Lyon both have connections with Hart. Lyon lives in the Santa 
Clarita Valley and Herrington has worked with his brothers Dean and Rick as 
Hart assistant coaches. Dean applied for the job last year after Rick Scott 
resigned to take the job at Buena High, but Herrington left the school after 
Strauss chose Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington, with his two brothers working as assistants, led Bellflower to an 
8-3 record and a third-place finish in the Suburban League. The Buccaneers lost 
in the first round of the playoffs, but 1988 marked their first postseason 
appearance in six years.

AFTER SOME DETOURS, ERIC ANTHONY MAY FULFILL HIS PROMISE WITH THE ASTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Anthony stepped back into the batter's box at the Houston Astrodome 
Saturday facing a zero-and-two count and San Francisco's Rick Reuschel, the 
National League's starting pitcher in this year's All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, 21, a left-handed hitting outfielder from San Diego, had just been 
called up from Houston's double-A team in Columbus, Ga. It was hoped he could 
add some muscle to an outfield that had produced just five home runs all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Some 420 feet away sat a soon-to-be-lucky fan about 20 rows up the right-center 
field pavilion. Seconds later, he became the owner of Anthony's first major 
league hit -- a total that exceeded his high school varsity production by 100%. 
</P>
<P>
A few innings later, Anthony connected with a Rich Gossage pitch for a double 
that hit just inches below the yellow line that marks the top of the outfield 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
In front of a national television audience, Anthony displayed the kind of swing 
that made him a minor league star and "untouchable" prospect in the Astros 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 with Class A Asheville, N.C., Anthony led all minor leaguers in home 
runs (29), while driving in 89 runs and hitting .273, despite missing the first 
month of the season. This season in Columbus, he had 28 home runs, 79 RBIs and 
a .300 average before he was called up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
With Glenn Davis supplying 23 of the Astros' 59 home runs this season, Anthony 
could provide an added punch the team needs to overtake the Giants in the 
National League West. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the organization figured he was ready for the jump," said Art Howe, 
Houston's manager. "It's hard to say how he will do. He's only played three 
ballgames. But he's hit the ball well. He's got a quick bat with a lot of pop. 
</P>
<P>
"His attitude is outstanding. He's all business . . . (And at least) for the 
time being, he's in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
A little more than three years ago, Anthony could not have dreamed of such a 
scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony was born in San Diego and grew up in Rancho Penasquitos. For three 
years, he attended Mt. Carmel High School, a perennial power in San Diego 
County baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel's baseball coach, Sam Blalock, said Anthony hit six or seven home 
runs for the freshman team and that he probably would have started on the 
varsity his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
But he was academically ineligible and forced to sit out as a sophomore. As a 
junior, he regained his eligibility and started as a running back for the 
Sundevil football team. 
</P>
<P>
When baseball season arrived, Anthony remained eligible under CIF standards but 
not his mother's. Again, he sat out. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't getting after it in school," Anthony said. "It was one of those 
things that happened. Being young and blind, I didn't realize the consequences. 
I wasn't performing up to my mom's standards. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I really didn't have any desire to play baseball. I was into 
football. I loved it. I think I was a good running back, and I probably could 
have played somewhere after high school." 
</P>
<P>
That came sooner than he expected. Instead of going to Mt. Carmel for his 
senior year in the fall of 1985, he dropped out and moved to Oakland to live 
with his brother, William. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Anthony moved again, this time to Houston to live with 
another brother, Mike. His parents are divorced; his mother, Jo Krole Phillips, 
and younger brother, Bernard, live in Cardiff by the Sea, his father somewhere 
in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
While in Houston, Anthony took classes at Sharpstown High and eventually passed 
a test to receive the equivalent of a diploma. He was also working to support 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a learning experience," he said. "Definitely. If I had the maturity I 
have now, I would not have done some of the things I did." 
</P>
<P>
In May 1986, Anthony was mature enough to call Reggie Waller, an Astro scout 
and minor league manager who had shown interest in him in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, a San Diego resident and part owner of the San Diego School of 
Baseball, said he remembers going to watch a North County Palomino League game 
in the summer of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strange thing," Waller said. "A fellow was talking with me and some 
of the other scouts. I've known (him) for a long time and he said, 'I don't 
know why you're watching these other kids. The best guy around is Eric 
Anthony.' I tried to act like I didn't hear him and just walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Waller contacted Anthony and set him up to play with a summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a pudgy little kid, about 5-11 (he is now 6-feet-2), 195 pounds," 
Waller said. "He was a mess in the field. He couldn't field the ball. He would 
run the wrong way. To say the least, he wasn't that overwhelming, until he 
stepped in the batter's box. His first time up, he hit one out. Way out." 
</P>
<P>
A few more plate appearances, and Waller was convinced of Anthony's talent, raw 
as it was. He sent a recommendation to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
But then, said Waller, "About two weeks later, he disappeared. Nobody knew 
where he went. It wasn't until he called me from Houston in 1986 that I knew 
what had happened to him. All my counterparts claim I hid him out in Houston 
(until the draft)." 
</P>
<P>
Houston drafted Anthony in the 34th round, but the Astros were not sure they 
were going to sign him . . . until they saw him take batting practice for the 
first time in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out just as he was finishing taking his cuts," said Chuck Pool, 
Houston's assistant director of public relations. "All the coaches and scouts 
had gathered around the cage, and I saw these big smiles. I was wondering what 
was going on. He had hit about three or four home runs, and I think it was the 
first time he had used a wood bat." 
</P>
<P>
The Astros signed Anthony and sent him to their rookie team in Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
His first season was full of frustration. He played in just 13 games and had 
three hits and five strikeouts in 12 at-bats (strikeouts continue to be a 
problem, 127 in his last 403 minor league at-bats). Because of his 
inexperience, he spent that first season the way a rookie quarterback might, 
holding a clipboard on the sidelines, trying to learn the game and its 
intricacies. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dan O'Brien, the Astros' director of scouting: "Eric was about as raw and 
crude a player as you can be. Plus, he had been working, and he was nowhere 
near in shape to play. It took him about six to eight weeks just to get into 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"The evaluation by Mr. Waller was that he had excellent physical tools, and he 
was very good athlete. We drafted him in the 34th round but that's only because 
we felt that none of the other 25 teams knew about him. If he had played in 
high school or given a different set of circumstances, he would have been a 
much higher draft choice." 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Anthony: "I was a little raw, like I still am. But at that point, I 
was just excited to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'd be talking with the guys. And they would all be talking about 
their glory days in high school or wherever. They would ask me about mine, and 
there were none. I didn't play. They were excited for me when they heard that." 
</P>
<P>
The next year, he was back in rookie ball, but he was given a chance to play 
every day. And he produced. He led the Gulf Coast League in home runs (10) and 
RBIs (46) while batting .264. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he was promoted to Class A, where he continued to hit and improved 
dramatically on defense. He was fast becoming the talk of the organization and 
this year was invited to the big league camp in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pool: "He hit only one home run in spring training, but it was a mammoth 
shot at Orlando . . . Whenever he took batting practice in spring, he became 
the feature attraction. The media and the fans all wanted to know when he was 
hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony batted .348 for the spring, but was cut with two weeks left. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I wasn't going to make the team," he said last Wednesday, a little more 
than 24 hours before receiving word from assistant general manager Bob Watson 
that he was being called up. "I figured they'd send me down and let me play 
every day. And hopefully . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, like so many others in the organization, had thought the Astros would 
bring him up when rosters are expanded from 24 to 40 players on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Astros in the thick of the divisional race, Anthony is being given 
an early but deserved shot. 
</P>
<P>
Said Blalock, his would-have-been high school coach: "I don't know what made it 
for Eric. Maybe he had already gone through enough hard times. It doesn't 
surprise me, but it certainly makes me think well of him."

Viacom Inc.: The New York-based entertainment concern posted a net loss of 
$34.7 million for the second quarter, compared to a $44.7-million loss a year 
ago. A non-cash charge of $32.8 million related to incentive compensation 
contributed to the loss, the company said. Viacom reported second-quarter 
revenue of $364 million, 22% higher than in the 1988 period; syndication of 
"The Cosby Show" and increased advertising and affiliate income from MTV were 
cited.

Eastman Kodak Co.: The Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic equipment and 
chemicals firm posted second-quarter net income of $60 million, down 85% from 
the record $390 million of a year ago, due to restructuring costs. Without 
those costs, the firm said earnings would have amounted to $287 million, down 
26%. Profit was further depressed by higher costs, including greater interest 
expense, and the unfavorable impact of exchange rate changes. Sales totaled 
$4.5 billion, up 9%.

Safeway Stores: The Oakland-based supermarket chain said second-quarter net 
income plunged 82% to $7.6 million while revenue rose 4.4% to $3.3 billion. 
Results reflect after-tax gains of $27.2 million on the sale of hundreds of 
Safeway stores. Since a $4.2-billion leveraged buyout in late 1986, the chain 
has sold more than half its stores that once numbered 2,325 and now stand at 
1,125. Safeway said operating profits from its remaining stores rose 8.9% to 
$105.9 million.

THE BLOOM IS OFF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

Superconductivity: The New Alchemy by John Langone (Contemporary Books: $19.95; 
218 pages) 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, superconductivity was all the rage. You could hardly open a 
newspaper or popular magazine without reading about this miracle of science, 
which enabled electricity to be transmitted over special wires without any 
resistance -- and therefore without any loss. This development was said to 
presage a revolution in the way we live. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the press was duped, mind you. (Perish the thought.) The press merely 
repeated what scientists said and predicted. Not just any scientists, either. 
Reputable scientists. A Nobel Prize was awarded for this development. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there were warnings that it would take a while -- perhaps quite a 
while -- before this laboratory achievement would be translated into practical 
applications, but they were overwhelmed by pictures of levitating magnetic 
trains and visions of new medical technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Though scientific journals continue to publish papers on superconductivity and 
how it works, the bloom is somewhat off the rose in the popular press. Having 
greeted the discovery with great fanfare, the public now appears to be waiting 
for real-world applications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Written From Clippings 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, John Langone has written a book that does little more than repeat 
the initial enthusiasm without carrying the story much further. 
"Superconductivity" is largely written from old newspaper clippings, so if you 
followed the story at the time, you won't learn much that you don't already 
know. 
</P>
<P>
Langone repeats the warning that putting this technology to practical use will 
require patience and a commitment to the long term, which, he says, the 
Japanese are better prepared for than we are. But even that part of his book is 
based on previously published material. 
</P>
<P>
If there's anything new in Langone's book, I couldn't find it. Perhaps it would 
make good reading for someone who missed the superconductivity fad and needs to 
catch up. Others should wait for a better book, one that tells more about 
contemporary work and, incidentally, is less breathless about the great changes 
that superconductivity has in store.

The House on Tuesday voted, 399-18, to give an antitrust exemption to the TV 
industry so it can try to adopt voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing violent 
programming. The bill would give television networks, local stations, producers 
and the cable TV industry a three-year antitrust exemption to work up 
guidelines for depicting non-news violence on television. At present, such 
discussions would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, which caused the demise of 
previous industry self-regulation under the Television Code of the National 
Assn. of Broadcasters. A Senate version of the bill was approved May 31 with an 
amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) that also would allow the TV industry to 
discuss ways to curb scenes that glorify drug use and portray sexually explicit 
material. A House-Senate conference committee will have to work out differences 
in the two bills, which probably won't take place until after the August 
congressional recess. Broadcasters, aware that Congress could impose mandatory 
restraints, have supported the legislation but are concerned that they would be 
vulnerable to lawsuits from anyone they did not include in the talks on curbing 
violence. Broadcasters instituted a "family viewing hour" in the 1970s but 
abandoned it in 1976 when the TV industry was sued by the Directors Guild of 
America on First Amendment grounds.

Despite announcing last month that it was suspending operations following 
anti-Semitic remarks by a group associate, the New York rap unit Public Enemy 
has continued to perform live and is now expected to resume full operations -- 
including recording. Spokesmen for the group said Tuesday that Public Enemy's 
Chuck D., who denounced the anti-Semitic statements by the group's since-fired 
"minister of information" Prof. Griff, is expected to clarify the band's plans 
in a press conference sometime this month. Sources confirmed that the group has 
appeared at several concerts since the "suspension" announcement, but only to 
fulfill contractual obligations and without Griff. Public Enemy's latest 
single, "Fight the Power," is featured prominently in the movie "Do the Right 
Thing."

MURDER SUSPECT'S 'OBSESSION' FORETOLD IN STUDIO VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carrying a huge teddy bear and a bouquet of flowers, the man accused of killing 
actress Rebecca Schaeffer appeared at the studio where she was taping a 
television show two years ago and begged to see her. 
</P>
<P>
But security guards, one of whom would later describe "something haywire" about 
Robert John Bardo, removed him from the lot and talked him into returning home 
to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, recalled this week by Jack Egger, chief of security for The 
Burbank Studios, provided one more glimpse into what authorities maintain 
became Bardo's fatal obsession with the 21-year-old actress, who was shot to 
death July 18 when she opened the security door of the Fairfax District 
apartment building where she lived. 
</P>
<P>
Egger, a former Beverly Hills police captain, said he followed standard 
procedure in informing Schaeffer's production unit of what happened that June 
afternoon in 1987. But whether anyone alerted Schaeffer to Bardo's appearance 
remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
People who were present remember hearing about a persistent fan trying to gain 
access to the set but are unsure whether Schaeffer was told. Two producers of 
the television series segment Schaeffer was taping, thought to be the people 
most likely to have advised her, did not return The Times' phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that it may not have made much difference whether she was 
notified. The young actress already had received apparently normal fan letters 
from Bardo. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, it seems that she should have been warned; in reality, few gave 
a second thought to the lovesick youth with the teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
"So a fan tried to get on the lot. So what? Who's going to think he's a 
potential murderer?" asked Mimi Weber, vice president of the production company 
for "My Sister Sam," the 1986-88 sitcom that featured Schaeffer. "It would have 
seemed harmless: another young kid who's star-struck. We have tons of those. 
Lots are lovable; some are crazy. But who's to know?" 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Schaeffer shooting, security is being tightened at the 
studio lot where Warner Bros. Television, co-producer of "My Sister Sam," 
operates, according to spokesmen. They declined to provide details, but said 
part of the reenforced security will focus on audiences that attend live 
tapings. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. Television says its policy has always been to inform actors of 
potential threats from fans or other people who stalk sets, make provocative 
phone calls or are otherwise perceived as being dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
But studio executives concede that the incident involving Bardo two years ago 
may have seemed too insignificant, too run-of-the-mill to have aroused unusual 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
"Actors are apprised when the situation is considered threatening," Warner 
spokesman Doug Duitsman said, adding that he did not recall the Bardo studio 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Tucson, Bardo's hometown, where he was arrested July 19 and charged 
with Schaeffer's murder, said interviews with the suspect's family confirmed 
his trip to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
And, Tucson Police Capt. Michael Ulichny said, Bardo over the last five years 
also traveled to Maine, apparently to seek out Samantha Smith, the schoolgirl 
who became pen pal to then-Soviet Premier Yuri Andropov, and to New York as 
part of a fascination with pop music stars Tiffany and Debbie Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obsessed' Youth 
</P>
<P>
In describing his meeting with Bardo, then 17, Egger recalled that the 
"obsessed" youth first made numerous telephone calls to the production office, 
asking to speak to Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on June 2, Bardo arrived at the lot, a facility known as The Ranch, where 
"My Sister Sam" was taping and insisted on seeing the actress to give her the 
flowers and teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was just lovesick, which I think he was," said Egger, 62. "He was 
terribly insistent on being let in. 'Rebecca Schaeffer' was every other word. 
'I gotta see her. I love her. If I could just see her for a minute.' " 
</P>
<P>
Egger said his security guards escorted Bardo from The Ranch to Egger's office 
so the two could chat. The security chief told the youth that he could not 
interrupt the taping of the television show. He said he finally persuaded Bardo 
to give up and go home. 
</P>
<P>
Egger said he drove Bardo to the run-down motel in Hollywood where the youth 
was staying. He said Bardo promised to return to Tucson soon. And Bardo called 
Egger the next day, saying he was about to board the bus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Raving Lunatic' 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to be an intelligent kid, no raving lunatic, no dumbbell, but 
something was definitely wrong, mentally," Egger said. "There was something 
haywire going on, but I didn't perceive it as potentially violent." 
</P>
<P>
Egger, the studio's security chief for 10 years, said that his staff is always 
in tune to potentially dangerous fans and that he felt the Bardo problem had 
been taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
After sending Bardo home, he informed the production company of what had 
happened and alerted his staff to be on the lookout in case the man returned. 
He said he could not have had Bardo arrested because he had not committed a 
crime; he had not even trespassed. 
</P>
<P>
"We get 100 (cases) in a year, people trying to get in, fans writing letters," 
the security chief said. "What more could I have done?" 
</P>
<P>
Bardo's appearance at the studio came at a time that Schaeffer's co-star, 
actress Pam Dawber, had been receiving threatening telegrams, Egger recalled. 
Those were reported to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notification 
</P>
<P>
Sue Cameron, Schaeffer's agent at the time, said she felt sure the young 
actress had been notified that an overly persistent fan had tried to get onto 
the lot. But security had "taken care of it," the incident had passed and it 
was forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Such casualness is changing, the agent said. She now urges all of her clients 
to obtain post office boxes as a way to remain more anonymous and less 
accessible and to take extra precautions when answering their doorbells. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, she said, "we have treated these things too cavalierly." 
</P>
<P>
In response to the Schaeffer slaying, a state legislator Tuesday announced 
legislation to restrict public access to information held by the Department of 
Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo was allegedly able to locate Schaeffer through a private investigator's 
routine check with the DMV, which makes home addresses available to any state 
resident for a small fee. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said he will introduce a bill that will 
allow drivers to list a business or agent's address or a post office box. 
Access to home addresses would be restricted to law enforcement agencies, 
insurance companies and others deemed "appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with $1 to $5 can fill out (a DMV form) . . . and in a short time, get 
the home address of their favorite anchor person, favorite movie star, favorite 
Dodger or favorite politician," Roos told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said the DMV received 16 million such inquiries last year.

CITY COUNCIL BACKS OFF ON MAYOR PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL and FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lacking a political consensus on how to proceed, the Los Angeles City Council 
balked Tuesday at a proposal to take a lead role in investigations of Mayor Tom 
Bradley and his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
On a sharply divided vote, the council sent to committee and almost certain 
defeat a motion by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores to form a interagency "super 
committee" -- led by council members -- that would coordinate the various city 
investigations of Bradley's affairs and related allegations of mismanagement in 
city departments. 
</P>
<P>
The action represented a victory for the beleaguered mayor, who has opposed 
expanding the investigations, and City Atty. James K. Hahn, who some council 
members have criticized for moving too slowly in his 4-month-old investigation 
of Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it was necessary," Hahn said of the consolidation effort. 
</P>
<P>
Also praising the council action was Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who said the 
creation of a major new council committee would be premature. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department and other agencies involved in the investigation have not 
completed their work, Gates said, and "whenever there's a lot of people 
involved, it's difficult." LAPD officials this week persuaded City Controller 
Rick Tuttle to delay an audit of the city treasurer's office and other city 
agencies because "we found we were working at cross purposes," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' motion followed revelations last week of bungled attempts in the city 
treasurer's office to cover up irregularities in the awarding of city deposits 
to Far East National Bank, which paid Bradley in 1988 as an adviser. It was 
disclosed that someone in the treasurer's office had "whited-out" a notation on 
a document that a $2-million Far East deposit had been made "per the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, whose business dealings and personal finances are under investigation 
by city, state and federal agencies, denied influencing the decision to deposit 
with Far East -- an account endorsed by city Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations prompted a flurry of indignant reactions from City Council 
members, some of whom expressed frustration with the pace and thoroughness of 
the city attorney's investigation. Such sentiments seemed to have faded 
perceptibly by Tuesday, and the Flores proposal was effectively killed after 
less than five minutes of debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote Falls Short 
</P>
<P>
Seven members voted to discuss the matter and six were opposed. A vote of 10 
was needed to launch a debate. 
</P>
<P>
Council President John Ferraro, who was among those last week clamoring for a 
more aggressive council role in the inquiries, said Tuesday that Flores' 
proposal was unnecessary. He also said he was satisfied with Hahn's recent 
statements that the investigation is on track and may be completed by 
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Even Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a frequent Bradley critic whose Finance and 
Revenue Committee hearings last week provided a stage for the latest 
revelations, voted against debating the Flores proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, Bradley's leading ally on the council, said: "What 
the council did was reaffirm that the city attorney and the Police Department 
should do their work and not be impeded by hearings and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said that the proposal died because some of her colleagues, whom she 
declined to name, have their own plans to "keep their fingers on this 
news-making item." She said that without a single committee coordinating the 
investigations they will proceed in a haphazard and inefficient manner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees 'Grandstanding' 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who failed to win support for a separate motion to 
have various investigating agencies brief the council on their inquiries, also 
accused some of her colleagues of "grandstanding" on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he opposed the Flores motion because the council "shouldn't go 
off half-cocked." He said, "There was not a consensus for anything. Therefore 
there was a danger that nothing would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he believes that the council's ad hoc committee on ethics and 
investigations should begin a comprehensive examination of the allegations 
lodged against Bradley. "It is (the committee's) responsibility; they should 
take it seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Woo, who chairs the ethics committee, may have come out a winner in the 
maneuvering Tuesday. It appears any council investigation of Bradley's affairs 
may revert to Woo's ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
And Woo entered a motion Tuesday to beef up his panel staff in preparation for 
public hearings on the various investigative reports expected to begin being 
released next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council More Willing 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Woo said he believes that the council will be more willing to 
hire its own investigative staff and hold hearings if the city attorney's 
investigation and others result in no charges. 
</P>
<P>
"If the outcome is ambiguous, it would be appropriate for the council to step 
in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in marked contrast to the tumultuous hearings held last week, the 
council's Finance and Revenue Committee quietly wrapped up its inquiry into the 
treasurer's office on Tuesday, offering a list of recommendations on new 
policies and procedures for the troubled city agency. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he is recommending that office adopt strict policies requiring 
competitive bids for deposits, that bid sheets be time-stamped and numbered, 
that bank eligibility for deposits be reviewed twice annually and that a firm 
policy on doing business with minority institutions be written and submitted to 
the council for approval.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PEGGY BUCKEY MAKES CAMEO APPEARANCE IN 
RADER TRIAL

The marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation trial was interrupted most of 
Tuesday afternoon when defendant Peggy McMartin Buckey was summoned by an 
agitated judge in the adjacent courtroom, where jurors have been deliberating 
the fate of accused murderer Harvey Rader for nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 62, was asked about a report the judge had received that she had 
discussed the Rader case in the presence of a juror during a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and her son, Ray, who are charged with molesting 11 children who 
attended their Manhattan Beach nursery school, are in their third year of 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, a one-time Reseda auto dealer from England, has been on trial since last 
March for the murder of a Northridge family -- Israeli immigrant businessman 
Sol Salomon, his wife, Elaine, and their two children, Michalle, 15, and 
Mitchell, 9. The four disappeared in October, 1982, but their bodies have never 
been found. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lorna Parnell, Buckey 
said she had simply commented that she felt "very sorry" for the family of one 
of Rader's alleged victims. The conversation, Buckey said, took place in an 
elevator, and her comments were directed to an attorney friend. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to them," she quoted herself as saying of the victim's 
parents. At that point, she said, a juror also in the elevator identified 
herself and the conversation stopped. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the afternoon hearing conducted outside the presence of the full 
Rader jury, the juror told the judge that Buckey had said more, referring to 
Salomon as "Sol." 
</P>
<P>
The juror also volunteered that in a previous conversation she once told Buckey 
that "you're a strong lady." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the defense nor prosecutors asked for a mistrial, and Parnell ordered 
the jury to resume its deliberations today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, next door, Superior Court Judge William Pounders admonished the 
McMartin jury to speak up if they hear anyone discussing their case, and to 
avoid watching television or reading about either case. 
</P>
<P>
"As always happens in this courthouse, with such limited space and so many 
people," he said, "conversations about the case even by non-participants can 
have an effect on the jurors." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Buckey said she had come to know the Rader juror and the victim's 
parents during hallway conversations in the crowded downtown criminal courts 
building. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a friendly person," she said. "I speak to everyone." LOIS TIMNICK

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWSUIT OVER TAIWAN PROTEST SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwanese human rights group and the city of Monterey Park have settled a 
suit filed after that city's police prohibited protesters from wearing masks 
during a May, 1984, demonstration protesting Taiwanese government policies. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was staged to show opposition to martial law in Taiwan, which 
was lifted in 1987. Protesters wanted to wear masks because they feared that, 
if identified, their families in Taiwan might suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Police told the 50 marchers that their permit would be revoked if they wore 
masks. In addition, police photographed and videotaped the group. 
</P>
<P>
According to the settlement, the city agreed to destroy any evidence, including 
photographs, gathered during the demonstration. The plaintiffs have been 
invited to a ceremonial shredding and burning of the evidence Aug. 14 at 
Monterey Park City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. City Atty. Stephanie Scher said Tuesday that the city agreed not to take 
pictures of people in masks unless police have specific information that 
serious criminal activities or violence would be likely to occur during a 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely pleased with the settlement, which affirms the constitutional 
rights of Taiwanese residents of the U.S. to demonstrate freely," said Paul 
Hoffman, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. 
The ACLU represented the Taiwanese Human Rights and Cultural Assn.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-LAPD OFFICER LOSES BID FOR PAROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Board of Prison Terms on Tuesday denied convicted murderer Paul 
Perveler parole for the third time after a hearing that featured testimony from 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials rescheduled Perveler's hearing for August, 1990, and set the 
condition that the former LAPD officer undergo a psychiatric evaluation before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying was Perveler's first wife, Lela Halverson of Glendale, who said 
her ex-husband vowed to kill her for testifying against him. Nolan became 
involved with the case after being contacted by Halverson and eventually 
authored legislation that forced prison officials to consider public outcry in 
deciding parole cases. 
</P>
<P>
Perveler, convicted of murdering his second wife and the husband of his 
girlfriend in the late 1960s, originally had been sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was commuted to life when California outlawed the death penalty, 
and in 1978 he was given a parole date of 1985, which was eventually denied 
after protests from the public.

BLAZE LEAVES DOZENS OF APARTMENT HOUSE RESIDENTS HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fourteen-year-old Zulma Partida's school became her temporary home Tuesday 
after an early morning fire swept through a two-story apartment building in 
South-Central Los Angeles, leaving her and about 45 others homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought this would happen," the eighth-grader said, sitting with her 
family under the basketball hoop in the gymnasium of George Washington Carver 
Junior High. "I play here. . . . I never thought I would have to sleep here." 
</P>
<P>
About two hours after a 1 a.m. fire struck the apartment house, Red Cross 
officials relocated the tenants, including 10 children, into the gymnasium less 
than a block away. The fire at 632 Vernon Ave. caused an estimated $280,000 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they have not determined the cause of the blaze, but most 
of the residents said it began shortly after a fight broke out among occupants 
of a first-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"There was screaming and fighting and the sound of windows breaking after a 
fight (broke out). . . . The next thing you know there was smoke and fire all 
over the place," said Jesus Mandonado, 51, who shares a small one-bedroom 
apartment on the first floor with his brother and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire officials rushed to the scene and began evacuating the 
residents, most of whom were asleep when the fire started. There were no 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Zulma's mother, Leovigilda Castillo, 33, who is expecting a baby within days, 
said she did not believe her family would escape from the flames. 
</P>
<P>
"The smoke and fire was all over. I thought we were going to get trapped. I was 
feeling the pains of my baby," Castillo said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters less than an hour to contain the blaze. When it was over, 
six apartments on the first floor were destroyed and the remaining units were 
left uninhabitable by smoke and water damage. 
</P>
<P>
There are 18 cramped one-bedroom apartments in the building. Some measure a 
mere 8 feet by 8 feet. On the second story, the ceilings are only four feet 
high in some places. Zulma, her two brothers, her mother and her stepfather 
paid $225 a month rent for the apartment they moved into three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents said they lost all their belongings in the fire. "The 
only thing we have is the clothes we are wearing," said Guadeloupe Rodriguez, 
28, cuddling her 2-year-old son, Pedro. "We have nothing left."

BOOKSELLER SAYS POLICE INTIMIDATE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO-COMMUNIST OUTLET ASKS PROBE BY COMMISSION

<P>
Saying its staff has been harassed, intimidated and spied on by police, a 
bilingual revolutionary bookstore Tuesday asked the Los Angeles Police 
Commission to investigate a series of alleged abuses that threaten to 
permanently disrupt the store's activities. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed by the Southern California branch of the American Civil 
Liberties Union on behalf of Libros Revolucion, a pro-Communist bookstore that 
caters to Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Libros Revolucion in the complaint claims that its workers have been detained 
by police for political reasons and its patrons have been threatened and 
discouraged from entering the store. Further, officers have followed people 
leaving the store and mounted a stakeout in front of the building on 8th 
Street, the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Cited 
</P>
<P>
"These acts taken together raise serious concerns about an LAPD campaign to 
undermine the bookstore's ability to operate freely, if not to operate at all, 
and to prevent bookstore personnel from engaging in protected political 
activity," the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorney Paul L. Hoffman, in a press conference, called on the Board of 
Police Commissioners to investigate the allegations, punish any officers guilty 
of abuse and disclose whether the Police Department is acting out an 
orchestrated plan to make it difficult for the store to function. 
</P>
<P>
"Police should not be engaged in harassment of this bookstore, or any 
bookstore, or any individual engaged in political activity," Hoffman said. 
"It's very important that a bookstore be protected in its ability to distribute 
literature, free from harassment by the LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
The case takes on significance because it represents the first formal complaint 
the ACLU has filed to suggest that the Police Department may be violating a 
1984 agreement that ended years of litigation and set guidelines to regulate 
police intelligence gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, the police cannot gather intelligence on political groups 
unless there is evidence the group is breaking the law. The agreement settled a 
lawsuit by 131 plaintiffs who accused the police of illegal political spying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assertions Denied 
</P>
<P>
Police Department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth denied that the department 
engages in "institutional" harassment, adding that all specific allegations 
made by the ACLU will be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the bookstore, who uses the pseudonym Lucas Martinez, said he 
believes that Los Angeles police are collaborating with federal agencies or 
private groups to thwart political activity by bookstore workers.

EVANS WINS U.S. TITLE IN 400 IM; 
</P>
<P>
TWO OTHER TEENS -- BLANCHARD, KOLE -- ALSO VICTORIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After breezing to another national title in the women's 400-meter individual 
medley Tuesday night in the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Long Course National 
Championships, 17-year-old Janet Evans said that she was starting to feel old. 
</P>
<P>
Not that she was aching in her bones or gasping for breath. But it's not the 
same as it was in the old days, when she swam in her first long course national 
meet at age 13. When she was a new kid and hung around with the other new kids, 
gawking at the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Now when she walks from the awards stand to the interview room, little girls 
follow along to peek in the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's the star. 
</P>
<P>
The down side to stardom is that there is no one to push her. 
</P>
<P>
She had some competition when she won the gold medal in the 400 IM during the 
Olympic Games in Seoul, enough to push her to a U.S. record of 4 minutes 37.76 
seconds. Tuesday, she won in 4:39.36 with Michelle Griglione almost eight 
seconds behind her. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, her first of this meet, puts her on the U.S. team that will 
compete at the Pan Pacific Games in Tokyo and then in a dual meet against the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard racing against the clock," Evans said. "I like to have 
competition. But what can you do? . . . I want to go faster at Tokyo. But there 
probably won't be anyone there, either. I'll have to do it myself." 
</P>
<P>
When it was suggested that she might get some competition when she meets the 
Soviets in Atlanta, she brightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," she said. "There is a Soviet girl who has a really fast 400 IM. I 
hadn't thought about that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the excitement and the competition of the Olympic Games made 
everything else seem like a letdown, Evans answered with her trademark smile 
and shrug: "The Olympics only come around every four years, and there are a lot 
of other meets in between that." 
</P>
<P>
Two 16-year-olds won the other women's events Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Blanchard (granddaughter of 1945 Heisman Trophy winner Doc 
Blanchard) won the women's 200-meter breaststroke in 2:31.59, and Julie Kole 
(who had won the 1,500-meter freestyle Monday) won the women's 200-meter 
freestyle in 2:00.95. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Schroeder, 27, a swimmer who could tell Evans what it is to feel old on 
the deck, won the men's 100-meter breaststroke. Schroeder, who won a gold medal 
with the 400-meter medley relay team in Seoul, has left his job as an 
accountant with Price Waterhouse to become a carpenter. He prefers the physical 
work to the hours behind the desk. But his hours for weightlifting and training 
are still limited. 
</P>
<P>
Why does he continue to swim? 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to do it because I thrive on competition," Schroeder said. 
"Physically, I don't think I was ready to go 1:02.4, but, boy, I don't like to 
get beat, so I did it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (the younger guys) like me hanging around, but I want to keep 
them honest. They'll pass me eventually, but they'll have to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gjertsen, 22, who won two gold medals on relay teams in Seoul, has 
completed a suspension for his limited involvement in the mask-napping caper in 
Korea, and is again competing for Longhorn Aquatics. Gjertsen beat fellow 
Olympian Melvin Stewart in the men's 200-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Wade King, who won the men's 100-meter butterfly, heard Evans saying that she 
felt old and commented: "How does she think I feel?" King is 22 and is just now 
starting to make his mark. 
</P>
<P>
He was thrilled with his national title and the prospect of competing for the 
U.S. in Tokyo. So far, the highlight of his career has been competing for the 
U.S. in the Pan Am Games in 1987 -- while Evans and company were competing at 
the Pan Pacific Games in Brisbane, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
King, who swam for the University of South Carolina, explains that swimming 
there is not as "intense" as swimming in California or Texas or Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he planned to retire soon, he said: "Not now. Placing the way I did, 
I'll get a lot more financial support. I'll definitely be able to stay in 
swimming another year." 
</P>
<P>
Wade's time (53.72 seconds) was better than the 54.58 recorded in the 
consolation final by 1988 Olympic gold medalist Anthony Nesty. Because he is 
from Suriname and is not a U.S. citizen, Nesty, a University of Florida 
swimmer, was not seeded into the final of this U.S. championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
Competition will continue here through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
This meet is the selection meet for the Pan Pacific Championships in Tokyo Aug. 
17-20 and most of the swimmers will go directly from Tokyo to Atlanta for the 
Aug. 24-26 meet (the Alamo Cup) against the Soviet team. The Soviet swimmers 
will be coming from the European championships in Bonn, West Germany. . . . 
Mike Bottom, 33, who won the 1974 men's national title in the 100-meter 
butterfly with a time of 55.5 seconds and went on to a berth on the 1980 U.S. 
Olympic team, made the consolation final of the 100-meter butterfly Tuesday 
night swimming for the Walnut Creek Aquabears. He finished 15th in 55.44 -- a 
tick faster than his '74 time. . . . Olympian Dan Jorgensen of Blue Fin Swim 
Team (and USC) was fourth in the men's 200-meter freestyle.

The IAAF declared that athletes who admit under oath to using banned drugs will

"I have some reservations with respect to some of the proposals being made and

NEWSWIRE: LEMOND WANTS TO JOIN CYCLING TEAM IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tour de France winner Greg LeMond wants to leave the Belgian ADR cycling team 
after receiving a "phenomenal" offer from the 7-Eleven team in the United 
States, his team director said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jose De Cauwer said LeMond wanted to break his contract -- which does not 
expire until the end of next year -- but ADR had yet to decide whether to allow 
him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"If he desperately wants to go, there are two possibilities," De Cauwer said. 
"Either we tell him to stay and we start quarreling or we agree to let him go 
by mutual agreement." 
</P>
<P>
De Cauwer said that 7-Eleven had made LeMond an unprecedented offer, one ADR 
could never match. 
</P>
<P>
"They are ready to pay him a phenomenal sum and they are prepared to go to the 
bitter end," De Cauwer said. He would not specify details of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond and his lawyers have visited Hein Verbruggen, president of the 
International Professional Cycling Federation, to discuss ways of terminating 
the contract but Verbruggen said it would not be possible, according to De 
Cauwer.

DEPLETED RAIDERS CALL OFF SCRIMMAGES

<P>
With his team depleted by injuries, Raider Coach Mike Shanahan decided Tuesday 
to cancel all preseason scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, who has a dozen or more players on limited duty because of injuries, 
already had scaled back morning practices at Oxnard to no-pads workouts and 
decreased running drills. 
</P>
<P>
"In most scrimmages, you lose three or four players to injuries," he said. "I'd 
rather see them in game situations working against another team." 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan said it is the first training camp he has been involved with, college 
or pro, where no scrimmages were played. 
</P>
<P>
Starting left offensive tackle Rory Graves became the latest in a group of six 
Raiders to suffer pulled hamstrings. Linebacker Jerry Robinson was held out of 
practice with a groin pull, and tight end Mike Dyal suffered a hip injury. 
Cornerback Mike Richardson, a Plan B free agent from the Chicago Bears, was 
given a day off because of sore knees.

Another McKenzie boat drifts by and its oarsman hails Barry White, who is 
guiding two novice fly fishermen down the Bow River this day. 
</P>
<P>
"What'd ya do with those buggers?" the oarsman asks. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing personal. Translated, the oarsman is asking White how successful his 
clients have been using woolly buggers -- a big, black, furry artificial fly -- 
for lures. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," White replies. "We're putting the Adams (artificial flies) on now." 
</P>
<P>
He lies. 
</P>
<P>
"The caddis flies are starting to swarm on the surface, but the only fish 
rising are small," White confides to his clients. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, they'll stay with White's embellished version of the universally 
popular San Juan worm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so gaudy they call it the Las Vegas worm," he says. "I know a couple of 
other places." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no one knows them better. White, the proprietor of Bow River Anglers, 
has been guiding on the Bow since 1977, but only in about the last five years 
has the river come to be appreciated as a premier fly fishery -- some say, the 
best fly stream in North America, for the consistently large size of its brown 
and rainbow trout. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen inches is common, 24 a reasonable goal. As evidence, three No. 5/6, 
average-weight rods will snap under the strain of the fish this day. 
</P>
<P>
"Two things people say about the Bow are it's real pretty, and the fish are 
real tough fighters," White said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bow -- pronounced as in Elbow, a tributary that joins it amid Calgary's 
city streets -- flows from glaciers in Banff National Park 100 miles northwest 
of the city, winds through town and then rolls east to join the Saskatchewan 
River and eventually to dump into Hudson Bay. 
</P>
<P>
It follows a changing montage of scenery from mountains to metropolis to 
prairie. Floating the length of the Bow you will hear the buzz of a big city 
and the cries of waterfowl. Skyscrapers drift past, then "buffalo jump" cliffs, 
which show the bleached bones of animals driven to their deaths by Blackfoot 
Indians in the 19th Century, and now the mud nests of swallows under the 
overhangs. 
</P>
<P>
Merganser ducklings skitter across the surface, unable to fly but determined to 
flee from the intruders. A great blue heron flaps ponderously away. 
</P>
<P>
White knows his river, which averages about 400 feet in width and has the 
individual features of some of the famous Montana fly streams. 
</P>
<P>
White said: "It has runs with the riffles and rocks of the Madison, and other 
places that are slow and flat, with a uniform depth and lots of grass, like the 
Henry's Fork, and others with steady flows and pockets of fish, like the 
Bighorn." 
</P>
<P>
The best stretch -- the part worked by the guides -- is the 41 miles of the 
lower Bow south of Calgary. North of the city, anglers may use live bait and 
keep two fish of any size, but the swifter water makes the fish difficult to 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
South of town, angling is restricted to artificial lures, and only two fish 
smaller than 40 centimeters (15 3/4 inches) may be kept. That assures that the 
larger, breeding-age fish are kept in the river. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, White exercises his own restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the fish live in a river that has just flowed through a city 
of 670,000, he said, "I wouldn't recommend eating any of them, or else you 
might glow in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, "I fish barbless hooks all the time and my customers think I'm a 
hell of a nice guy. Actually, it's for self-preservation." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, especially when working with novices, as he is this day, his floppy 
hat will catch a back-cast or two. 
</P>
<P>
A river guide has been described as a combination of fisherman, teacher, 
comedian, philosopher, historian and, when circumstances demand, marriage 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Because it's a competitive business, some would prefer not to deal with novices 
because it requires considerable patience and the catch counts are nothing to 
advertise. White seems not to care. 
</P>
<P>
"The fishing is as intense as the fishermen want to make it," he says. "Today 
I'm doing a lot of teaching, so it's kind of laid back." 
</P>
<P>
A mix of terrific fishing and his teaching soon pays off. 
</P>
<P>
"Fish the 'nervous' water," White advises. "It's blue, where the currents 
converge. The nervous water offers more protection. See that brown water? 
That's shallow, with a gravel bottom, (where the fish are) more vulnerable to 
bag-billed critters." 
</P>
<P>
White means the white pelicans, a rival to anglers on most Western waters. 
</P>
<P>
The party shoves off from a roadside beach launch at 10 a.m. White has the 
novice's wife fishing a Brooks stonefly, the novice a Marabou leech pattern 
near the grassy bank. White, sitting in the middle, guides the boat downstream 
with the oars. 
</P>
<P>
"This is called nymph fishing from a boat," White says, "the laziest way you 
can do it." 
</P>
<P>
The action beneath the surface is slow. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:45 he notices hatching caddis flies buzzing around the banks and switches 
the lures to dry flies, for surface fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Some time later the party is passing some anglers who have stopped for lunch on 
the shore. To her delight, the novice's wife hooks a 19-inch rainbow, right in 
front of them, and plays it well into White's net. 
</P>
<P>
White rows into shore for lunch. One of the other anglers wades out to try the 
spot where the fish was caught. 
</P>
<P>
Spreading out a picnic buffet, White says, "I call these 'Barry's Bow River 
Dagwoods.' " 
</P>
<P>
Being on a diet, though, he has only a morsel for himself. White has lost 70 
pounds since March. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to release the Hulk under the bulk," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The party will be on the river for 10 1/2 hours, floating 15 miles, but it 
doesn't seem like that long a day. Not only the scenery but the fishing is 
constantly changing, and twilight doesn't arrive until 10:30 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually the fish are holding out in the deep pools during the day," White 
says. "Along about twilight, they'll move into the shallows to feed, (although) 
with clouds and shadows, they'll start moving in earlier." 
</P>
<P>
Downstream, he sees tiny specks flitting on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"Yellow duns," White says. "What we'll look for is the fish to come up to feed. 
It's pretty easy to catch 'em if you hit 'em (with a cast) coming up on 
(feeding) rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30, the mosquitoes show up, and by 8:15 a few fish are jumping. White 
switches lures from light Cahills to Adams and grabs a rod for himself. A 
beaver swims across the river. A fish steals White's fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I'm fishing this light -- three-pound test (line) -- but I 
need a light tippet so the fly will float," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A few more casts and it's time to leave the river. The visitors wonder if 
they'll see it the same again. 
</P>
<P>
Management of the fishery is minimal, besides the basic regulations. The 
nearest government fisheries biologist is based 100 miles north, in Red Deer. 
</P>
<P>
Some dams already have upset certain other fisheries in the area, and White 
says there is talk of another that would flood all of the prime Bow below 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be under 50 feet of water here," he says. "The threat is there. The 
announcement hasn't been made yet." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, White will hope for the best and continue guiding anglers down his 
river -- a mystique, he suggests, that may be over-rated. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started, I'd go to all the (fly fishermen's) conclaves and talk to the 
experts and ask all the questions," he says. "Then one day I realized that 
people were asking me the same questions. I figured I must have arrived."

ALABAMA TOWNS SHAKEN BY CHARGES OF FIXING;

INVESTIGATION RESULTS IN CONTROVERSY, CONCERN IN PREP FOOTBALL-HAPPY AREA

<P>
High School football is important to the tiny farm towns of northwest Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
"When Town Creek High School is out of town, you could not get enough people 
around here to put out a grass fire," said Robert Terry, a local aficionado. 
</P>
<P>
But this summer, football talk is not only about playing. It is about fixing. 
And if allegations are true, these towns and their football games may never be 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naive enough to believe that there hasn't been gambling going on," 
said Roger Gargis, owner of the Leighton Grocery &amp; Deli. "But to say that 
games are being fixed, that's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Such talk began after the FBI had seized more than $1 million in alleged 
gambling cash and property as part of an investigation into bookmaking in 
several north Alabama cities. 
</P>
<P>
When the two-year investigation became public, Florence Police Chief Rick 
Thompson said it had uncovered allegations -- not hard evidence -- that some 
high school coaches and officials conspired to fix games, perhaps altering yard 
sticks and game clocks. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed, and Thompson has not named names or schools. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was on vacation last week and could not be reached. A secretary in his 
office said he left word that there would be no further comment on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick bit off a little more than he could chew," Robert Terry said. "He likes 
to get his name on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is difficult to overstate the stir Thompson's remarks caused. 
</P>
<P>
Friday nights are football nights and if your local team is part of 
"championship row," it is all the more reason to eat early and head for the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert County High in Leighton, about 10 miles southeast of Florence, won the 
Class 5-A state title in 1985 and has reached the semifinals the last two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a losing season if we don't go to the playoffs," said Shorty Ford, owner 
of the Leighton Cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't find a seat over there on Friday night," he said, alluding to C. T. 
Manley Stadium, the 4,000-seat home of the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"Football . . . means virtually everything," said Gargis, the deli owner. "The 
school has been very successful, winning its share of championships. The 
community takes a lot of pride in that." 
</P>
<P>
Travel east about 10 miles to Town Creek, home of the Hazlewood High Golden 
Bears. Their resume is impressive, too: Class 2-A champions in 1988 and winners 
of four state titles this decade, more than any other school. 
</P>
<P>
Drive east another five or so miles and there's Courtland, with fewer than 500 
residents and a high school team that won the Class 1-A state title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
To the players who will defend that title this year, the possibility that games 
were fixed is unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody asked me (to fix a game), I wouldn't do it," said Johnathan Orr, a 
junior who hopes to start at quarterback or free safety this season. "I like to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Terry, who said his life consists of "attending sports and fishing," is 
convinced that no high school games have been fixed, at least not in Town 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the state's prep athletic world, including Herman Scott, director of 
the Alabama High School Athletic Assn., are concerned that the image of prep 
sports in the state will be marred by the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be the most surprised man in the country if it comes up that they were 
fixing high school football," Terry said. "I'm not saying it can't happen. I'm 
just saying that there's not enough money bet on high school football for it to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
But what if Thompson's investigation reveals games were fixed? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like the death of somebody's parents," Terry said.

PATTISUE PLUMER ESCAPES SHADOW OF SISTER, ENDS LONELINESS OF LONG-DISTANCE 
RUNNER

<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, PattiSue Plumer lay in the medical tent at the U.S. Olympic trials 
in Indianapolis, trying to recover from the severe dehydration and heat 
exhaustion she had suffered in one of the most painful races of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for the third and final spot in the women's 3,000 meters, Plumer had 
overcome the heat -- 95 degrees and 60% humidity -- and some tremendous 
competition -- to stagger across the finish line with an Olympic berth in her 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, after recovering, Plumer left the medical tent to resounding 
cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many of the well-wishers, like so many well-wishers before, said 
the wrong thing: 
</P>
<P>
"Way to go, Polly! You're tough, Polly Sue!" 
</P>
<P>
Once again, PattiSue Plumer was being confused with her younger sister, Polly, 
formerly a track star at Irvine's University High School and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to scream at them, 'Her name is PattiSue! Give the woman some 
respect," said her fiance, Steve Levere. 
</P>
<P>
"But PattiSue just said, 'Forget it, Steve. It always happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
If making the Olympic team last year wasn't enough to establish PattiSue's 
identity, perhaps her performance July 3 at Stockholm, Sweden was. 
</P>
<P>
At Stockholm, Plumer ran second to East Germany's Kathrin Ullrich in the 5,000 
meters and set a U.S. record of 14 minutes 59.99 seconds, more than six seconds 
better than the record of 15:06.53 set in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The former record-holder? Mary Decker Slaney, who until Plumer's race held 
American records in every distance from the 800 to the 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, whose time of 14:59.99 ranks as the fifth-fastest women's 5,000 meters 
of all time, said the race was almost as tough as last year's Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real hard, the pain side of it I mean," said Plumer by phone from 
Stockholm the next day. "Plus the conditions were tough. It was 75 degrees, 
there was bright sun on half of the field, and the other half was in the 
shadows, so it was tricky to see. There was a lot of bumping, too." 
</P>
<P>
But the field, which also included Olympians Liz McColgan of Great Britain, 
Lynn Williams of Canada and Elly Van Hulst of the Netherlands, helped pull 
Plumer to a 20-second improvement over her previous best. 
</P>
<P>
And the crowd, as are most on the European circuit, was large -- about 35,000 
according to Plumer -- loud and supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"With three laps to go, there were four of us left," said Plumer, 27. 
</P>
<P>
"And with two laps to go, there were just three -- me, the East German 
(Ullrich) and the Canadian (Williams). With one lap to go, somehow I had a 
burst of energy and then it was just me and (Ullrich). 
</P>
<P>
"She passed me with 200 (meters) to go, I passed her back, she passed me and 
that was it for me. I was a little amazed I even made it to the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
Many were surprised by Plumer's performance, considering her race schedule in 
the few weeks before the Stockholm race. 
</P>
<P>
On June 24, Plumer won a 3,000-meter race in Birmingham, England, by outkicking 
McColgan. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, her flight was delayed 10 hours, her clothes were stolen and she 
lost the lucky pearl earrings she had received for her 16th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Plumer won another 3,000, at Villeneuve D'Asq, France. 
</P>
<P>
On June 26, Plumer flew to Lausanne, Switzerland, to try to get into a meet -- 
one in which the meet director, believing Plumer had little drawing power, had 
refused her entry. After much argument, Plumer was entered. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer not only won the race, but outran 1988 Olympic gold medalist Paula Ivan 
of Romania for the victory. Plumer's time of 8:42.12 was the fastest in the 
world this year, although she has since dropped to sixth in that event. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt great during the race," Plumer said. "I kept expecting that heavy 
fatigue to set in, but I felt fine. People kept asking me, 'Aren't you worried 
you're racing too much? Aren't you tired?' But the fatigue never came. All of a 
sudden it was me and Paula with a lap to go. I just went for it." 
</P>
<P>
Tenacity has become a trademark for Plumer, who, despite spending the last 
three years in law school, has managed to run on a consistently high level. She 
won the 3,000 at The Athletics Congress championships in June by out-kicking 
former Missouri star Sabrina Dornhoefer in the final 20 meters. Only 0.18 
seconds separated the two at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
At last year's Olympic trials, it was Dornhoefer who battled Plumer to the 
finish. Dornhoefer collapsed 10 meters before the finish line, and like Plumer, 
had to be carried from the track. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Plumer and Dornhoefer will meet again in the women's mile at the Jack 
in the Box Invitational at UCLA. The race, which starts at 5:40 p.m., will also 
include Suzy Favor, the three-time NCAA defending champion at 1,500 meters, and 
Cal State Northridge star Darcy Arreola. 
</P>
<P>
Slaney, the U.S. record-holder in the event at 4:16.71, was originally 
scheduled to compete, but had to drop out because of a chronic Achilles' tendon 
injury. Plumer said she is disappointed that Slaney will not be competing 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"What I learned in Europe is I can compete with anyone," Plumer said. "I may 
not be able to beat them (every time), but I know I can really compete with 
them. And if I have a good day, I feel I can beat anyone in the world right now 
-- including Mary. It's the first time I've ever felt that way." 
</P>
<P>
According to Plumer's college coach, Stanford's Brooks Johnson, Plumer wasn't 
always the most courageous runner. 
</P>
<P>
"During her freshman year, she was just going through the motions," Johnson 
said. "In that year, the qualifying standard for nationals in the 3,000 was 
9:40. She ran 9:39.9 to qualify and 9:39.9 (actually, 9:42.02) at the 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat her down and said 'Look, I brought you here because you're a freshman. 
If all you're gonna do is run the minimum, then you're just running on the 
recreational level. I want to see how much you want out of yourself.' That was 
a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, chosen by TAC as the women's 3,000-meter entrant to represent the 
United States in the International Amateur Athletic Federation World Cup meet 
Sept. 8-10 in Barcelona, ran almost a minute faster -- 8:55.98 -- the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer grew up in Newport Beach, but moved in junior high with her father to 
Ridgeway, Colo., a tiny town on the western slopes of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Plumer competed in track and cross-country, placing third as a 
senior in the mile with a time of 5:10, and the two-mile, 11:20, in the 
Colorado state meet. 
</P>
<P>
But at about the same time, about 1,000 miles west, Polly Plumer was making 
national news at University High. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Polly, who because of persistent injuries is now in semi-retirement at 
24, set the current national record for the high school girls' 1,600 meters -- 
4:35.24. 
</P>
<P>
Even when PattiSue went to Stanford, where she became a three-time All-American 
in track, placing second in the 3,000 meters for three consecutive years, 
people still confused her with her sister. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always Polly Sue Plumer to some people," Johnson said. "I can remember 
her running a race in L.A. and San Diego . . . through the whole race they 
announced her as Polly Sue Plumer. 
</P>
<P>
"She was clearly under her sister's shadow. There wasn't any sibling rivalry, 
but PattiSue would say, 'If I'm working my . . . off, the least they could do 
is get my name right.' " 
</P>
<P>
An understandable request -- perhaps now more than ever.

If you own lake- or pond-front property, there's a new underwater vegetation 
harvester called Water-Weeder, which can make quick work of those pesky 
submerged weeds. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which can be used from a dock, shoreline or boat, works like a 
below-the-water hedge trimmer or sickle. It uses four-foot stainless steel 
blades to cut most types of aquatic vegetation. It is lightweight -- about 8 
pounds -- and has an 8-foot aluminum shaft, with an optional four-foot section 
that can extend its cutting depth to 12 feet. The tool, with plastic and 
fiberglass handles and connections, is powered by a 12-volt motor that can run 
off a boat battery or a portable battery pack. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now, the only way to combat underwater weeds was with a large 
commercial harvesting machine" or with chemicals that could cause environmental 
problems, said Water-Weeder inventor Michael Schmidt of Waterside Products 
Corp. in Mahopac, N.Y., a lakefront community about 50 miles north of 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Water-Weeder, which took him three years to develop, is virtually 
tangle-free in operation, because its blades are mounted on special swivel 
joints that pivot in all directions. The blades can be reversed in motion, 
easily freeing snags. The harvester also comes with a special net to collect 
cut weeds when they float to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Water-Weeder costs $300, "about the price of a good lawn mower," said Schmidt. 
It can be purchased by calling the company's toll-free number, (800) 552-1217 
or writing to Waterside Products Corp. P.O. Box 876, Lake Mahopac, N.Y. 10541. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Flowers 
</P>
<P>
There's a new San Francisco company that specializes in sending fresh cut 
flowers anywhere by mail. But Calyx &amp; Corolla doesn't ship through your 
local florist; it mails flowers directly from growers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"This concept has never been tried before," said Calyx &amp; Corolla President 
Ruth Owades."I think it's the right idea for today, with upscale Americans 
spending more time at home, entertaining more, and demanding new levels of 
quality and service in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Calyx &amp; Corolla puts out four seasonal catalogues each year, which can be 
ordered through the company's toll-free line, (800) 877-7836. Owades' previous 
venture into catalogue selling was Gardener's Eden, a mail-order catalogue for 
garden items. She sold that venture to Williams-Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
Because her new company eliminates middlemen, Owades said it can offer flowers 
at "a good price," and deliver them fresher to customers because most varieties 
can be shipped via Federal Express the day they are ordered. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the firm can send 25 long-stemmed roses to a home, office, friend 
or relative for $88, which includes air delivery. Vases cost extra. Or, for 
$495, you can order a year of roses -- 12 long-stemmed, 18 classic or 24 
sweetheart -- to be delivered the first week of each month. 
</P>
<P>
The Calyx &amp; Corolla catalogue carries an excellent selection of floral 
varieties, including tropical, and will even offer Christmas trees, greens and 
wreaths in its fall holiday issue. All prices include air delivery charges. 
</P>
<P>
Owades explained that a small "apartment size" tree, 3-4 feet, from a tree farm 
in Michigan will cost $50; a 6 1/2-foot Frazier fur from North Carolina, $95. 
</P>
<P>
Step-by-Step Patios 
</P>
<P>
Do-it-yourselfers will be interested in Patio Pal, new plastic brick-laying 
guides that keep bricks permanently in place and weeds from growing in between. 
</P>
<P>
Each plastic form holds eight modular bricks so they will be spaced properly as 
you lay your patio or walkway. Designed by San Diego engineer Bob Goldman, 
Patio Pals come 10 to a package. The forms interlock and each space where the 
brick is to be placed has a drainage hole in the bottom of the plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have put your 2x4 edging around the space where you're building the 
brick patio, fill it with sand and smooth so it's level. Place the guides atop 
the sand and put a brick in each space in the form. Fill the joints between the 
bricks and mist. 
</P>
<P>
"The plastic doesn't slip once the bricks are in it, so you can't make a 
mistake and the bricks all sit in place neatly," said a spokeswoman for Argee 
Corp., Patio Pal manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Patio Pals can be ordered for $8.95 per package, plus shipping and handling, 
from Argee Corp., 9550 Pathway St., P.O. Box 222, Santee, Calif. 92071; phone, 
(619) 449-5050. Company representatives can tell you how many of the forms 
you'll need and the number of bricks, depending on the square footage of the 
patio or walk you're building. 
</P>
<P>
By late August, Patio Pals will be available in building supply stores, garden 
shops and home improvement centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Ties That Bind 
</P>
<P>
General Binding Corp. of Northbrook, Ill., recently introduced a new system to 
bind up to 30 pages of documents in their own folders. 
</P>
<P>
The GBC 1-Step can turn out permanently bound reports, contracts or 
presentations in 60 seconds, once you've placed them in special covers used 
with the machine. The 1-Step is compact -- only 12 inches square, 1 inch thick 
and weighing less than two pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Company representatives say the system works akin to a car's rear-window 
defogging system. Just as an electric current goes through the grid on the car 
window to defrost it, the 1-Step uses contact points to transmit electric 
current through the cover to melt adhesive and bind loose pages to the folder. 
</P>
<P>
The special covers, which come in six colors and two spine widths, are 
available in packages of 25 for $24. Suggested retail for the 1-Step binder is 
$99 and it can be found in office supply or stationery stores nationwide. To 
locate stores in your area, call the company's toll-free number, (800)

CONSUMER VIEWS: HUGE LOTTERY PAYOUT RAISES SOME QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: The recent California Lottery that was worth more than $60 million 
has raised a question in my mind. Winners are paid over a 20-year span. Suppose 
a winner dies after only five years. Will all California Lottery payments stop 
immediately, or will the winner's heirs continue to receive them for another 15 
years? -- R.B. 
</P>
<P>
Question No. 2: This trend in the lottery toward "pooling" money interests me. 
Doesn't this greatly magnify the work -- the payout -- for the state when, 
instead of a single winner, they have 10, 20 or 30 winners? -- K.F. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: First question first -- a million dollars is a million dollars is a 
million dollars. If you hold a lottery ticket worth a million dollars, to be 
paid out over 20 years, then that's what you, or someone, is going to receive. 
Yes, if you don't make it the full 20 years, then your heirs will pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
Players have been "pooling" tickets since the lottery began. How popular this 
practice has become, though, didn't really attract much attention until the 
giant pay-out of $60 million, which involved two pools -- one of about 25 
players and the other of about 16. 
</P>
<P>
Because the average American moves about once every four years (there's another 
average for you), and because during the next 20 years a few of the winners 
will probably die, who's going to keep the records straight in making sure that 
all pool members get their fair share every time the annual pay-out comes 
around? 
</P>
<P>
"We make only a single pay-out each year (to the person whose name is on the 
ticket)," the Lottery's assistant director of public affairs, John Schade, 
says. "The pools have to make their own arrangements about the division of it." 
</P>
<P>
The lottery's advice for pool players: "They should definitely have a written 
agreement spelling out the division and how the records will be kept. Our 
lawyers say it probably isn't necessary to have it drawn up by a lawyer, or 
even have it notarized, but everyone definitely must sign it." 
</P>
<P>
Once a big win has been scored, of course, it might be a good idea to have the 
agreement looked over by a lawyer, and it is definitely advisable to retain a 
third party -- a trust company, bank or some other intermediary who will be in 
business for a good 20 years -- which, for a fee, will keep the books, keep 
track of address changes, keep track of the heirs of deceased winners and, once 
a year, will make the actual disbursements. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose," Schade adds, "that in the case of out-and-out fraud, or someone 
absconding with the money, or something like that, we, at the lottery -- since 
it's spread over 20 years -- would probably step in and get a judgment to 
protect the others. But, other than that, it's up to the players themselves."

ALICE KAHN: THEY STILL ASK: WHO WAS THAT GIRL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in Ohio, Judy Cohen O'Brien is still worried about a bad rep. So 
worried that she called Helena Feldman Erlich in Los Angeles for a consult. And 
this is the only way I can tell her: Relax, Judy, it wasn't you. 
</P>
<P>
Judy's been worried about her reputation for 25 years, since she graduated from 
my high school in Chicago. To me, she'll always be a cool "older" girl -- older 
than me -- with a brush cut and a bucket bag. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently she's also an Ohio housewife whose deepest fears were triggered 
when she got hold of a book I wrote several years ago. The first story in the 
book described what life was like for adolescent girls in the bad old days 
before the birth control pill. It was about the one girl who broke the rules. 
</P>
<P>
After reading the book, Judy sent a letter to me via Ten Speed Press, the 
publisher. "It was with absolute horror that I turned to the first story, 'High 
School Nympho,' " Cohen O'Brien wrote. "Did she have a brush cut? Did she 
always carry a big purse? Would she be described as learning how to smoke at 
age 13 at Harry's? Was she me?" 
</P>
<P>
There were several funny things about this letter. One was that I had a brush 
cut, carried a big purse and learned to smoke at age 13 at Harry's school 
store. So that killed the fantasy of my own uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>
The other funny thing was how the letter punctured my theory of the high school 
nympho (HSN). Judy offered the names of several potential nymphos from our 
past. I thought each school was issued just one. 
</P>
<P>
See, back then most of us were willing to go "some of the way" but lived in 
terror of the complications of taking things to the limit. My story, in 
addition to describing the seemingly charmed life of our HSN, also described 
the tragic life of the Girl Who Got Pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Judy wanted to set the record straight. She explained that her best friend, 
Helena Feldman (now Erlich), "kept me virginal by swearing she wasn't doing 
anything -- and I didn't want to be the one they talked about." 
</P>
<P>
Then she offered the names of two girls who could have been the HSN. 
Interestingly, neither candidate was the girl I had in mind, the one about whom 
everyone said: She had to have it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Judy and Helena are worried that I might have meant them, and I have 
no way to relieve their anxiety. "Our breaths are bated for your answer," Judy 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But the final funny thing is that Ten Speed Press lost the envelope with the 
return address, and all I have is Judy's description of her Ohio town as "like 
being at a giant casting call for 'Deliverance.' " 
</P>
<P>
So, Mrs. O'Brien of Deliverance, Ohio, here's the whole story. While you were 
trying to go no further than Helena (who was gorgeous and had half the boys in 
the school running after her), I was trying to go no further than my best 
friend, Penny (who wasn't even dating). I fell in love my junior year with a 
boy who finally left me because I wouldn't "prove" my love. He was a chemist 
and demanded proof. All I ever asked of him was a hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
After we split up, I sat home and cried every night for six months because I 
was heartbroken. But I could never forget the Girl Who Got Pregnant. You knew 
exactly who she was, Judy, as you said in your letter. Who could forget what 
happened to her. Remember how she was kicked off the cheerleading squad and 
then kicked out of school? Remember how everyone stopped talking to her? Do you 
remember people wiping off the desk after she sat there? 
</P>
<P>
No, Judy, it wasn't you, and it wasn't Helena, and it wasn't me. 
</P>
<P>
I guess there must be a lot of fearful readers out there.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: SIMULATION AND COLD REALITY: THE TWAIN MEET IN TV NEWS; 
</P>
<P>
HANGING VIDEO: WHAT IS TV'S ROLE IN TERROR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The videotape was shadowy and grainy. Yet clearly visible was the body of a 
man, swirling slowly while dangling from a gallows. 
</P>
<P>
This time no one could accuse television of sanitizing or glamorizing violence. 
On the contrary, by showing gruesome footage of a man purported to be executed 
American hostage Lt. Col. Williams R. Higgins, newscast after newscast had 
raised another issue. 
</P>
<P>
This time did TV go too far? 
</P>
<P>
Was outrage over Higgins' apparent murder escalating to hysteria, prodded by 
TV? Would these grisly pictures -- supplied by his Shiite Moslem captors in an 
orchestrated media spectacle as macabre as anyone could imagine -- dangerously 
inflame public emotions, thereby pushing President Bush into an ill-advised, 
hasty response? 
</P>
<P>
Television's ability to intensify experiences is unique. It repeats events -- 
actually replays them on the screen -- that newspapers can only refer to in the 
past tense. The result can be devastating: a psychological conditioning, a 
shaping or changing of perceptions by constant repetition. 
</P>
<P>
So the purported Higgins death tape can be rerun again and again, with 
reporters, government officials and terrorism experts weighing in with analysis 
and speculation, jolting our consciousness and leaving an indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
Or would the death pictures have the opposite effect, desensitizing viewers to 
the horror of the apparent execution? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the ultimate answer, there was something ghoulish in the way the tape 
was used on much of American TV Monday, a body displayed like a piece of meat, 
as if the apparent death of Higgins at the hands of pro-Iranian terrorists was 
to be prime time for gawkers. 
</P>
<P>
The captors control our memories of their hostages from across the seas. As a 
nation, sadly, we recall them only when their captors wish us to recall them. 
"They have the power to impale millions of us on powerful images," Peter 
Jennings said of the terrorists in leading off Monday's "World News Tonight" on 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
There are times, however, when the media assist with the impaling. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, it was necessary for the public to see at least a portion of the 
so-called Higgins tape, in some form, if only to understand the brutality of 
the crime. A still shot of the body and a mention of its resemblance to Higgins 
would have sufficed. But TV news producers thought differently. 
</P>
<P>
How much was too much? This much. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all newscasts aired not only footage of the body twisting at the end of 
the rope, but also a closeup of the victim's face. It was grotesque. It was 
obscene. It was unnecessary. And it was dangerous, inviting hysterical reaction 
and potentially making it harder for the Administration to proceed with quiet 
diplomacy. By whipping up public opinion, such coverage can perilously 
accelerate the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bush, protesting the apparent murder of Higgins: "Somehow there has got to 
be a return to decency and honor, even in matters of this nature." And in media 
coverage of matters of this nature, too. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's edition of "The CBS Evening News" aired a still picture of the hanging 
body followed by tape of the body and also that ghastly closeup. The "NBC 
Nightly News" showed a still of the body, followed by tape, followed later by a 
replay of the still. 
</P>
<P>
CNN and "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS showed the tape of the body 
swinging and the closeup. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "World News Tonight" showed only stills of the body from various angles, 
including the closeup of the head. "No need for us to demean Col. Higgins by 
showing him swinging," said Jennings, sounding sanctimonious while appearing to 
take a swipe at his competition. But the swinging body was no more demeaning 
than the stationary closeup that ABC showed, a closeup that resembled a death 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
On the local front, KCBS-TV Channel 2 used footage of only the swaying body's 
legs and stills of the head on its 5 p.m. newscast, followed by only the stills 
on the 6 p.m. newscast. KABC-TV Channel 7 used stills of the body and face. 
Other local stations used the body/face tape footage, staging a mini-horror 
show. 
</P>
<P>
So much of TV is a show. The same box that brings you the chilling spectacle of 
a murdered American also brings you entertainment. Not long after after 
watching the Higgins footage with Jennings or Dan Rather or Tom Brokaw, much of 
the news audience was probably emersed in "MacGyver" or "Kate &amp; Allie" or 
"Alf." 
</P>
<P>
This is a medium where CNN's "Larry King Live" opened Monday night with a sober 
discussion of the Higgins case and closed with Vanna White, a medium where 
everyone sits at the same lunch counter and inevitably uses the same menu. 
</P>
<P>
So, naturally, KNBC's opening footage of Higgins came shortly after a funny 
news promo starring sportcaster Fred Roggin and weathercaster Fritz Coleman as 
synchronized swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, KCBS followed the Higgins story with a commercial break that 
included a "Channel 2 Action News at 5" promo grouping its broadly smiling 
anchors for a family portrait. Most of the news is bad. Why are they smiling? 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, KABC, prior to giving way to "World News Tonight" at 7 p.m., teased 
its 11 p.m. newscast by again showing a closeup of the apparent hanging 
victim's face. In some ways, then, the story had already been bent to the needs 
of TV promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Thomas Friedman of the New York Times charged 
on "Nightline" Monday that Higgins had been exploited in this tragedy by both 
his terrorist captors and the Israelis. Add TV, too, with results yet to be 
determined.

PLANS UNVEILED FOR NEWPORT MUSEUM'S NEW BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preliminary drawings and a model of the Newport Harbor Art Museum's new 
$25-million building in Newport Beach were unveiled Tuesday by museum 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Genoese architect Renzo Piano said the design for the 10-acre site would create 
"a place of discovery, a microcosm protected by an organic shelter which 
invites visitors to wander and explore." The new structure, at the intersection 
of East Coast Highway and MacArthur Boulevard, is scheduled to open in late 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the expansion is necessary because the museum's present 
23,000-square-foot building about a mile away is too small to show the 
permanent collection and temporary exhibits simultaneously. Triple the size of 
the current facility, the new space will eliminate the museum's "down time" 
periods when it has nothing on view because a temporary exhibit is being 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
The interior space of the one-story, 87,129-square-foot museum will be defined 
by a series of longitudinal walls parallel to Coast Highway. Carving the 
low-lying (approximately 26 feet high) building into the hill was Piano's 
response to the site's 32-foot view plane limitation. Construction may not 
block views of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Piano said the design "acknowledges the primacy of the automobile as a means of 
transportation in Southern California" and establishes "a private, 'secret' 
entry, away from the noise of the traffic at the busy intersection." 
</P>
<P>
The barrel-vaulted roof, which Piano calls a "flying carpet," will be the first 
room of the museum that a visitor will encounter, Piano said. It will merge 
with the surrounding vegetation of the hillside and serve as the entrance to 
the museum. Entering from Avocado Avenue, visitors will park on a lot level 
with the roof and traverse a rooftop sculpture garden. Entry to the museum will 
be a 15-second glide downward into the museum's lobby on an escalator. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a pedestrian "street" running through the center of the building will 
connect the "fingers" that house the various departments and functions of the 
museum: the two permanent collection galleries, the temporary exhibit gallery, 
auditorium, restaurant, bookstore, education and staff support areas. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the museum, interior space will be penetrated by nature. The two 
permanent collection galleries will be lit by natural light (directed through 
the roof as well as laterally) and visitors will have multiple views of the 
surrounding gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Building materials have not yet been fully determined, but Piano said the 
vaulting will be concrete, connected with cast iron elements. He said he would 
like the walls to be a natural material, preferably stone. 
</P>
<P>
Although Piano acknowledged the "low-key, modest" aspects of the building and 
his desire that it not dominate the works of art, he maintained that the 
simplicity and clarity of the design and the "emotional experience" of 
discovering the interior space were "monumental" qualities in the best sense. 
</P>
<P>
Museum board member Rogue Hemley said that a $50-million capital campaign (for 
the building, furnishings and endowment) is "above the first 20%" of its goal. 
Earlier estimated as $40 million, the new figure is due in part to a $5-million 
increase in the projected cost of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Board member David Carroll said the six-month design development phase of the 
project would begin later this month. Ground breaking is set for late 1990 on 
the site, valued at $10 million by the Irvine Co., which donated it to the 
museum.

He's actually singing these days instead of shouting. What's more, he even 
seems to care about what he's singing. 
</P>
<P>
His sold-out show at Hollywood Bowl on Monday night was one of his best in 
recent years. Right now, the gravel-voiced singer, backed as usual by an 
excellent band, has one of the liveliest shows in rock. 
</P>
<P>
His most recent album, the year-old, 2-million-selling "Out of Order," has not 
only rejuvenated his sagging career, it seems to have rejuvenated him too. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's shows this decade have mostly been all frolicking and little serious 
singing. Fun's fun, but his casual attitude was getting to be a bit much. He'd 
sing off-key or blow lyrics and didn't seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Stewart seemed like an over-the-hill rocker having his last 
fling. In those days, when he sang ballads such as Otis Redding's "Dock of the 
Bay" and "Try a Little Tenderness," he appeared to be resting up from his 
relentless, pointless prancing. But at the Bowl, he put some feeling into those 
songs. You felt his conviction -- his genuine effort to interpret the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
These days, he's striking a balance between rollicking rowdiness and vocalizing 
with conviction. On Monday, he very carefully sang the material from his 
current album and had rip-roaring fun with oldies such as "Twistin' the Night 
Away," "Every Picture Tells a Story" and "Hot Legs" -- songs that he can by now 
sing with a minimum of effort. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart still does some of his signature preening, prancing and fanny-wiggling 
-- but not nearly as much as he used to. Maybe he thinks it's too undignified 
for a 44-year-old man to spend a whole show cavorting like a Chippendale's 
dancer. 
</P>
<P>
When he did some leaping and prancing (he's amazingly limber for an old-timer), 
it seemed to have more of a purpose. Maybe he just wanted to show that he can 
still do it -- that's he's one rocker who's not yet ready for the rocking 
chair.

A MELDING OF FORM, CONTENT IN FORNES' 'FEFU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Irene Fornes' elusive "Fefu and Her Friends" is many things, but soap 
opera is not one of them. Yet even the most eager ear for Rhonda Gelfand's 
staging at the Los Angeles Theatre Collective can't ignore a certain hothouse 
quality that has you looking around for the TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, our eyes provide the camera angles -- more so than in most plays. 
That is because some of the action of Fornes' tongue-in-cheek drama takes place 
in four rooms of Fefu's house, which we wander around, following the hostess 
and her female guests (Jon Cohen did the "environmental/art design" and Steve 
Morgan Haskell the lights, which include a bedroom illuminated by lights placed 
under the bed). 
</P>
<P>
In one room, Fefu and Emma (Sarah Dacey and Rachel Boring) talk about female 
fear of body parts while exercising. In the living room, Cindy and Christina 
(Carrie Madsen and Wendy Wood) talk about getting swept off their feet. In the 
kitchen, Sue tells Paula (Donna Babbin and Krista Keim) that she's figured out 
that relationships last seven years and three months -- then Sue's former 
lover, Cecilia (Elizabeth Mehditach), walks in. In the bedroom, a paralyzed 
Julia (Maria Hayden) comes out with it: Women are evil, men are human. 
</P>
<P>
This last is the ingrained assumption that Fornes' women try to unburden 
themselves of. But the intimately viewed scenes, plus the group interplay in 
the living room, suggest that it's a yoke not easily removed. "Maybe," Sue says 
about breaking up, "it never really ends." 
</P>
<P>
The world of Fornes' people never seems quite real, if you insist on a linear 
sense of reality. Even the reason why they're over at Fefu's, to prepare a 
pitch for a progressive-sounding educational project, feels inserted. 
</P>
<P>
The late, masterly fiction writer, Donald Barthelme, once noted that collage is 
the guiding principle of modern art -- a principle that undergirds everything 
Fornes does. Think of a collage work, done on a globular surface, which can be 
seen only by rolling the globe around, and you get a sense of what it is to 
watch "Fefu and Her Friends." 
</P>
<P>
It may be part of the reason why Fornes' work is infrequently staged here 
(except at the current Padua Hills Playwrights' Festival, of which she is a 
fixture). This kind of largely successful experiment in melding form and 
content can both dazzle and puzzle actors and directors accustomed to more 
conventional dramaturgy. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to the soap opera problem. While Gelfand's cast has a firm 
grasp on such subtleties as the idea that we may be seeing, in the central 
room-to-room scenes, various stages in a woman's life, the line deliveries too 
often stress a melodramatic accent outside of Fornes' poetic dialect. 
</P>
<P>
The approach requires a slightly clinical stance, in the way Pirandello does, 
otherwise you end up with actors going one way, the playwright going the other. 
Dacey and Hayden understand this, but their colleagues are still learning. 
</P>
<P>
 At 712 Grandview Ave., on Fridays and Saturdays, 8:30 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m., 
through Aug. 20. Tickets: $10; (213) 386-4901.

PROMOTER BRISTLES OVER EVERLY BROTHERS' 'DISDAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Everly Brothers' 11th-hour cancellation of their Aug. 17 double-header at 
Humphrey's on Shelter Island has left promoter Kenny Weissberg angrily vowing, 
"I'm never going to deal with them again." 
</P>
<P>
Weissberg's anger is understandable. For one thing, the no-show is costing him 
money. Since the date was booked last March, he's spent nearly $3,000 on 
advertising and promotion (primarily on radio) -- all for nothing, it turns 
out. 
</P>
<P>
For another, the no-show is costing ticket-holders money. As of July 17, when 
the Humphrey's date was abruptly canceled, more than 1,100 local Everly 
Brothers fans had already purchased tickets to the two shows, mostly through 
Ticketmaster outlets. And while the ticket price is refundable, the 
$2.50-per-ticket "service charge" ($3.50 if ordered by phone) tacked on by 
Ticketmaster is not. 
</P>
<P>
What angers Weissberg even more than the actual cancellation is the runaround 
he was given while trying to discern the reason for the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's standard practice in the concert business for every act to have a 30-day 
cancellation clause in their contract," Weissberg said, "which means they can 
cancel any show, for whatever reason, as long as they notify the promoter at 
least 30 days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"So when the Everly Brothers' agent called me on July 17, 31 days before their 
scheduled appearance at Humphrey's, to tell me the date was off, there was 
nothing I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Weissberg wanted to know why. And when the agent told him "it was 
because Phil Everly doesn't like Humphrey's," he said, "my reaction was one of 
surprise, of disbelief, because the Everly Brothers had played for me in 1986 
and again in 1987 and I had never sensed for a minute that Phil was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
"So I tracked down the band on the road -- leaving messages at every hotel 
where they were staying, in every city they were playing -- until finally I 
woke up their tour manager three days later," Weissberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The Everly Brothers' tour manager, he said, told him the cancellation "had 
nothing to do with Phil having anything against Humphrey's." Instead, he said, 
he was told that on the duo's spring concert tour of Europe, they had played 
several double-headers and each time "Phil's voice had faltered during the 
second show." 
</P>
<P>
"So when they came back to the United States in mid-June," Weissberg said, 
"they decided to cancel every upcoming two-show-per-night engagement, including 
the one at Humphrey's." 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, had he not been informed of this decision at the time, Weissberg 
wanted to know. He could have saved a month's worth of needless advertising and 
promotional expenditures; he could have put an early halt to ticket sales for a 
pair of shows that never were to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask the agent," the tour manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Weissberg promptly did ask the Everly Brothers' agent, who swore he knew 
nothing of their dislike for playing two shows a night. 
</P>
<P>
"He pointed out that there are several big-paying fair dates that are two-show 
situations that the Everly Brothers are still doing," Weissberg said. 
</P>
<P>
After he put the phone down, Weissberg said, he did a little thinking and 
eventually concluded that "what the whole thing boils down to is that I wasn't 
offering the Everly Brothers enough money to make it worth their effort." 
</P>
<P>
"My only question is, why did they accept my offer in the first place? 
Ninety-nine percent of the artists I contract with honor their commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"And by failing to honor their commitment, the Everly Brothers have not only 
slapped me in the face, they've shown total disdain for their fans." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: The recently reunited Doobie Brothers will appear Oct. 1 at Balboa 
Park's Starlight Bowl. Fans of the group's original country-boogie sound can 
rest easy: Current members are all from the early 1970s, pre-Michael McDonald 
incarnation that produced such hits as "Listen to the Music," 'Long Train 
Runnin' " and "China Grove." 
</P>
<P>
At last week's spectacular concert by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers at San 
Diego State University's Open Air Theater, the Replacements had just finished 
the opening set when Country Dick Montana of the Beat Farmers, walking up the 
center aisle, was tackled by a flashlight-waving bouncer. No, the burly 
"yellow-jacket" didn't demand to see Montana's ticket; he merely asked for, and 
got, an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's the Jacks have officially severed ties with Rounder Records, the 
small East Coast label that last year released, with virtually no promotional 
support, their delightful debut album of "blue-eyed soul" originals, "Jacks are 
Wild." "So we're free agents once again," writes singer-guitarist Buddy Blue in 
the group's latest newsletter, "and can shop around for a new, hopefully more 
aggressive label to release our sacred noise." . . . Local upstarts Bad Radio, 
meanwhile, are setting up a showcase performance at Club Lingerie in Los 
Angeles to audition for interested MCA Records execs. . . . A brief interview 
with Mojo Nixon appears in the September issue of Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. for Dwight Yoakam's Sept. 17 appearance 
at the Starlight Bowl. Opening for the rootsy twangster will be the Desert Rose 
Band, fronted by Chris Hillman, a former member of such venerable country-rock 
outfits as the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers and the Souther-Hillman-Furay 
Band.

HORMONES MAY INCREASE CANCER RISK, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long-term use of a popular hormone therapy given to millions of older women to 
reduce the symptoms of menopause and prevent osteoporosis may quadruple their 
risk of developing breast cancer, a startling new study by Swedish and U.S. 
researchers suggests. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, announced Tuesday in Sweden and to be published Thursday in the 
New England Journal of Medicine, found that women who took a combination of 
estrogen and progestin for more than six years were 4.4 times more likely than 
others to develop cancer of the breast. 
</P>
<P>
The study "could change the way we think about post-menopausal hormone 
replacement," Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of UC San Diego wrote in an 
editorial accompanying the study. Yet she and others said the findings are too 
preliminary to recommend a change in practice. 
</P>
<P>
A significant percentage of all menopausal and post-menopausal women -- some 
experts estimate one-third to one-half -- receive estrogen replacement therapy. 
Production of natural estrogen hormones in the ovaries slows down during and 
after menopause. 
</P>
<P>
The hormone therapy is used in the short run to minimize symptoms of menopause, 
such as hot flashes, sweating and other physical changes. In the long run, 
physicians use it to prevent the bone-thinning, or osteoporosis, that afflicts 
many older women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Combined Therapy 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, most of those women also receive progestin, a synthetic 
form of the female hormone progesterone. Progestin is used to counteract an 
unintended side effect of estrogen therapy discovered in the 1970s -- its 
tendency to increase a woman's risk of uterine cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"This article hits at the heart of our philosophy that patients should be on 
estrogen and progestin," said Dr. Jonathan S. Berek, director of gynecologic 
oncology at UCLA School of Medicine. "This questions the assumption that it is 
entirely safe, at least from the standpoint of the breast." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied 23,244 Swedish women age 35 or older who received 
various types of estrogen therapy. They then compared their rate of new cases 
of breast cancer to that of women in the same region who did not receive 
estrogen replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The women on estrogen were on average 10% more likely to come down with breast 
cancer during the six-year study, the researchers found. The longer the women 
received estrogen, the greater their risk: women who were on estrogen nine 
years or more were 70% more likely to come down with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly potent form of estrogen, called estradiol, which is not used 
widely the United States, was associated with a nearly 200% increase in risk. 
Other types of estrogens appeared to result in no increased risk of breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Experts said Tuesday that the study's most provocative finding was the fourfold 
increase in risk of breast cancer among women on combined estrogen and 
progestin therapy, the approach that has grown increasingly popular in the 
United States in the past 10 years and is the therapy of choice for women who 
have not had a hysterectomy. 
</P>
<P>
"This paper says (the addition of progestin) may actually increase the amount 
of breast cancer you get from estrogen alone," said Dr. Brian E. Henderson, a 
cancer specialist at USC. "You don't want that effect. But it's a worry we've 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Experts stressed that the Swedish findings must be confirmed in further studies 
before any change in medical practice can be recommended. They said any 
suspected drawbacks of the combination therapy must be weighed against its 
proven benefits. 
</P>
<P>
For example, estrogen therapy is believed by some to reduce a woman's risk of 
heart disease and stroke, in addition to its other benefits. Some also noted 
that progestin is being prescribed in lower and lower doses, perhaps reducing 
any risk. 
</P>
<P>
"To a woman on estrogen replacement therapy, the message we all want her to get 
is 'Don't change what you're doing,' " said Henderson. " 'You're doing the 
right thing. We're just trying to understand better how to maximize the benefit 
to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risks and Benefits 
</P>
<P>
Barrett-Connor said the study "might draw attention to how little we really 
know about the best possible combinations or single drugs that would have the 
best risk-benefit ratio. We really don't have that information yet and we're 
scrambling to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. S. B. Gusberg, a past president of the American Cancer Society, said it may 
prove necessary to make estrogen therapy a short-term, rather than a long-term 
therapy. Studies suggest there is no added risk in taking the hormones up to 
five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take the combination for relatively short periods . . . up to four or 
five years," said Gusberg, an emeritus professor of gynecology at Mt. Sinai 
School of Medicine in New York. "The message is, don't take any powerful 
substance, like estrogenic hormone, forever." 
</P>
<P>
The authors were Dr. Leif Bergvist and others at University Hospital in 
Uppsala, Sweden. Also involved were researchers from the U.S. National Cancer 
Institute.

7 INSURANCE FIRMS TOLD TO RETURN $305 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
COMMISSIONER'S TENTATIVE ORDER APPLIES MAINLY TO NON-AUTOMOBILE POLICIES; 
APPEALS POSSIBLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie Tuesday tentatively ordered seven 
leading insurance sellers to give $305.3 million in rate rollbacks to their 
California policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning the long process of compelling companies to roll back premiums in 
accord with Proposition 103, Gillespie's biggest rollback orders, for the most 
part, applied to homeowner and earthquake, not automobile, policies. 
</P>
<P>
Finding earthquake insurance rates excessive, she ordered rollbacks as large as 
92% in those premiums. The homeowners rollback orders ranged up to 9% and most 
of the auto insurance rollbacks were relatively minuscule, although one 
company, USAA, was ordered to roll back its auto premiums 16%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fair Rate of Return' 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 originally called for uniform rollbacks of 20% from 1987 levels 
for most lines of property and casualty insurance. But the state Supreme Court 
ruled in May that the rollbacks had to be adjusted by the insurance 
commissioner to assure the companies a "fair rate of return." 
</P>
<P>
In most of these initial decisions, Gillespie ordered rollbacks well under 20% 
and in some lines no rollbacks at all, although in a few she ordered rollbacks 
well in excess of the 20% standard. 
</P>
<P>
The rollback figures she released Tuesday are also keyed to present prices, not 
to the often much lower 1987 prices Proposition 103 said should be used as the 
base from which the cuts would be figured. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the orders can be contested by the individual companies at a series of 
hearings that will begin in September, and final rollback orders can be 
appealed by the companies to the courts. So it could be months or even years 
before refund checks are in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
The seven companies subject to the initial orders Tuesday are Allstate, ordered 
to roll back premiums by an overall $85.7 million (6%); State Farm Fire &amp; 
Casualty, by $83 million (7.9%); USAA, by $56.7 million (17.3%); California 
State Automobile Assn., by $44.8 million (4%); Safeco, by $19.5 million (7.9%); 
20th Century, by $14 million (2.4%) and Progressive Casualty, by $1.6 million 
(1%). 
</P>
<P>
The State Farm company listed is not the main State Farm Mutual company, the 
largest seller of auto and homeowners insurance in California. That larger 
company, and hundreds of others, will be subject to rollback orders in coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of significant statements that gave the first solid indication of 
Gillespie's approach to rollback and other impending rate decisions, the 
commissioner: 
</P>
<P>
* Declared that she is setting the "fair rate of return" standard at an annual 
11.2%. This, she said, was the average rate of return for all U.S. property 
casualty insurers during the years 1973 through 1987. By comparison, she 
estimated that the insurers have recently been realizing about a 15% annual 
rate of return in California. 
</P>
<P>
* Said she had found most of 4,000 separate insurer filings for exemptions from 
Proposition 103-mandated rollbacks "very much biased in favor of the insurance 
companies." Having determined that she could not rely on them, she said, she 
based her first rollback orders on figures developed through examinations of 
1988 company records conducted by her staff. 
</P>
<P>
* Concluded, based on industry profitability figures for 1987 compiled by the 
National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners, that California insurance sellers 
had earned a 29.2%, or $150 million, return on homeowners policies that year, 
while losing 7.5%, or $227 million, on automobile insurance. She said this 
indicates that homeowner policies are subsidizing auto policies in California, 
although the subsidy is not enough. Other lucrative lines of insurance offset 
the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
* Said she hopes, over a period of several years, to make each line of 
insurance in the state self-sustaining, with the insurers earning close to the 
11.2% rate of return, but that this could not be done in automobile insurance 
without legal reforms that would reduce costly litigation. Proposition 103 is 
bringing to the surface much information about insurance pricing that the 
Legislature will not be able to ignore, she said. 
</P>
<P>
* Vowed that, in making rollback decisions, she will not award any company a 
higher rate than it is charging now. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's tentative rollback orders and her statements Tuesday drew a frosty 
reaction from insurance firm spokesmen who insisted that the commissioner was 
being too hard on the companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaction Is Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from consumer groups was mixed, with some compliments from 
representatives of the Consumers Union and the Insurance Consumer Action 
Network on grounds that Gillespie has toughened her attitude toward the 
companies, and strong criticism from Proposition 103 chairman Harvey Rosenfield 
and his favored candidate for insurance commissioner, Conway H. Collis, who 
both said she was not nearly tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty promptly said it will resist giving any 
rollbacks. "We feel our rates are fully justified and we'll be able to 
demonstrate that at the hearing," said Judith Mintel, a company lawyer and rate 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reaction is one of disappointment," said Rick Dinon, a spokesman for 20th 
Century. He said his company has always sought to be an efficient, low-cost 
provider and does not think rollbacks of its premiums would be justified. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Murphy, a spokesman for Allstate, said Gillespie's orders represent only 
the start of a long process and that his company is convinced that hearing 
officers will uphold Allstate's present rates. 
</P>
<P>
On the consumer side, Rosenfield called the commissioner's pronouncements "all 
bogus" and insisted that Gillespie was, in fact, accepting most of the "phony" 
financial figures submitted by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Justified' 
</P>
<P>
Collis said, "The ordering of such minimal rollbacks is not justified by either 
the facts or the law. . . . She has placed the burden on consumer 
representatives to fight in the hearings for greater rollbacks. . . . She has 
prejudged the process in favor of insurers. The insurers may act unhappy, but, 
in fact, they must be ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
But Judith Bell of the Consumers Union gave credit to Gillespie for "stepping 
out front and taking on some of the larger companies," and Steven Miller of the 
Insurance Consumer Action Network said he found "a lot of promise" for 
consumers in what the commissioner had done. 
</P>
<P>
Bell cautioned, however, that in setting "a fairly low rate of return" standard 
for the companies, Gillespie may have paradoxically ushered in a new, 
protracted period of insurer litigation, thus delaying refund checks 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, for his part, expressed concern that in setting one standard for fair 
return Gillespie might be favoring less efficient companies while penalizing 
the more efficient. He noted, for example, that she had directed a 17.3% 
overall rollback for one of the most efficient companies, USAA, while ordering 
only a 1% rollback for Progressive Casualty, which he said is viewed as a less 
efficient one.

<P>
One sidelight of interest in Gillespie's statements Tuesday related to 
earthquake insurance, where she ordered the largest rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner noted that federal tax laws prohibit companies from reserving 
premiums against the possibly distant time of a damaging earthquake. So there 
are huge profits being made in this line of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But, she also noted, since the reserves are held down, it is unlikely that many 
companies would have the wherewithal at the time to cope with paying for the 
damages caused by a truly major quake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TENTATIVE ROLLBACK ORDERS 
</P>
<P>
 The following figures represent the state Department of Insurance's assessment 
of what rate rollbacks for individual insurance companies should be under Prop. 
103. Figures focus on four primary areas of coverage. Percentage figures 
indicate the percentage of premiums that would be returned based on present 
prices. Money figures in millions of dollars. The figures are subject to being 
contested by the companies in hearings that will begin in September. Final 
orders could be appealed to the courts.

LIFE INSIDE L.A.'S SLUMS: A WINDOW ON DESPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Figueroa has bought cans of Black Flag to fight cockroaches, and set 
traps to catch mice. She has nailed boards across one screenless window -- so 
the children won't fall out. She has put a large piece of plywood over another 
window -- to prevent stray bullets from fights in the street from shattering 
the glass above her bed. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Salvadoran immigrant -- one of perhaps 450,000 people who the 
city estimates live in slum conditions in Los Angeles -- so far has refused to 
surrender to the challenges of living in a little square box of a room at the 
Cameo Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her time is spent confined to this 12-by-12-foot space, which she 
shares with her two little girls and her two brothers, who recently fled El 
Salvador. She, Claudia, 1 1/2, and Yaritsa, 3, share the double bed while the 
brothers sleep on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We find ourselves under these circumstances," she says without a trace of 
self-pity, "but we can't afford to get a better place." 
</P>
<P>
When officials speak of slums in Los Angeles, they talk about supply and 
demand, tax laws, city task forces and the demographics of immigration. But the 
tenants tell a more basic, and tragic, story about the ugliness of these 
buildings, with their broken fixtures and leaky pipes, rats and maggots, 
endless noise, crime and fear. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the Cameo, just west of downtown at 504 South Bonnie Brae St., was a 
decent place. Made of solid brick and decorative trim, it was built in 1925 for 
tourists, who at the time considered nearby MacArthur Park a prime Los Angeles 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the carved relief "cameo" sculptures on the facade are gone or covered 
with graffiti. A fire escape climbs the front, ruining whatever grace was lent 
by the original design. A steel gate slices the lobby in two, making the place 
look more like a prison than the entrance to an apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, as the surrounding Westlake neighborhood deteriorated, 
transients, prostitutes and drug addicts moved into the Cameo. By the early 
1980s, Cubans from the Mariel boat lift were there. They were so rough, one 
former owner claimed, he had "to pay them off" just to get inside. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most of the 700 or more tenants living in the 174-unit building are, 
like Figueroa, from El Salvador. The majority are families with children, 
paying $250 to $275 a month. No deposit is required and utilities are included. 
</P>
<P>
This is about the cheapest possible rent in Los Angeles, but even so, people 
don't stay long. They move as soon as they can do better. Figueroa, there two 
years, is considered a longtime resident. 
</P>
<P>
The building has been a subject of several city prosecutions in the last 
decade, for unchecked vermin, defective plumbing, gaping holes in walls and 
ceilings or unsafe conditions in the event of fire. 
</P>
<P>
It is also among 11 properties named in City Atty. James K. Hahn's suit against 
142 property owners and their lending institutions, charging that they milked 
the buildings for profit and failed to maintain them. 
</P>
<P>
The suit calls the Cameo a "transitional slum" because the current owner, 
Mordehai Ben-Horin of Encino, has been fixing it up. Even so, he is a defendant 
along with his lender, Bengal Discount Corp. of Inglewood. He is accused by the 
city attorney of being a "straw man" for other hidden owners, an allegation he 
denies. Bengal is one of a cluster of affiliated lending companies that have 
financed slum properties throughout Los Angeles for several years. Bengal 
recently settled a portion of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Figueroa and other tenants say the building is a much better place than 
it was a few months ago. The rats and maggots that fed on human excrement and 
garbage in the halls and stairwells are gone. So are the winos and addicts who 
crept in at night to sleep in the passageways. 
</P>
<P>
There are other buildings that appear much worse. The front of 521 S. Union 
Drive a few blocks away, for example, is full of graffiti. Garbage spills out 
of dumpsters by the front steps. 
</P>
<P>
Herminio Ruiz, a 28-year-old cook who pays $280 for a "single" that includes 
three small rooms, shows holes where plaster has crumbled away and mice have 
come in, worn screens, warped windows and ceiling stains from leaks. 
</P>
<P>
This building is not included in the city attorney's suit, but the Department 
of Building and Safety has proposed that it be one of the first three 
properties in the city placed in a new "rent escrow account program." This 
would enable the city to place tenant rentals in special bank accounts; owners 
cannot retrieve the money until they make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Another building, at 4020 S. San Pedro Ave., southeast of the Coliseum, is part 
of the suit and has "the look" common to Los Angeles slums: long, dark, narrow 
hallways, institutional brown paint and walls and ceilings full of bulging 
lumps, left from years of patching holes. The common bathrooms at the end of 
the halls smell, and their walls are mildewed. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in Luz Ruiz's one-room unit, she shows holes in the walls, a door that 
cannot close properly or be locked and a window that won't close. But the 
toughest part about living in this building, she says, is the waiting in line 
every night, either to use the common toilets or bathtubs at the end of the 
hall or the one four-burner gas stove downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are definite effects on the psyche and physical well-being on people 
that are forced to live like this," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy 
for disease control for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
Serious and even life-threatening health conditions can result from rat 
infestations, lack of adequate water supplies and extreme hot or cold 
temperatures, particularly for infants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cheerless and Ugly' 
</P>
<P>
But slums are also "a depression-inducing environment," Fannin noted. "Much of 
the hopelessness you see among poor people has a lot to do with their 
environmental situation, which is so cheerless and ugly." 
</P>
<P>
The effect can be "very long-lasting to a child or to an adult's self-esteem," 
she added. When children play in dark hallways because it is too dangerous to 
play in the street, she asked, "What kind of distorted image of life comes out 
of an early childhood experience based on fear of other people, or fear of the 
streets or of being outside?" 
</P>
<P>
Several buildings named in the city's suit have been recently cleaned up, and 
like the Cameo, have fresh coats of paint in the halls and new lighting. But 
physical improvements alone don't turn a building around if the people and the 
neighborhood remain the same. So the Cameo is still a slum. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Figueroa still battles cockroaches and persistent ceiling leaks at the 
Cameo, the small 22-year-old with a heart-shaped face and short, curly dark 
hair must also deal with the street where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three buildings on Bonnie Brae that are closest to the Cameo are 
vacant. The street has a "narcotics problem," according to police, and nearly 
every night men furtively gather in small groups, or stagger along the sidewalk 
by themselves. If a stranger pauses near the billiards joint on the corner, 
someone approaches moving his arm up and down as if shaking dice -- a signal 
there is rock cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't let you sleep," Figueroa said. "In the morning I wake up, I'm very 
tired. They yell and they throw bottles. They break bottles fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Noise is ceaseless inside, too. There is loud music in other rooms, the sound 
of people walking on the floor above and the shrill cries of children playing 
in the halls because there is nowhere else for them to go. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Police Officer Phil Michaelson, the senior patrol 
officer in the area, the Cameo no longer has much of a drug problem, but it is 
a place where tenants argue a lot with each other. When police are dispatched 
to the building, he said, "most are dispute-type calls." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa doesn't spend much time outside, except to go to the store for food in 
daylight hours. She spends most of her time watching the children or cleaning 
her unit, which like most slum apartments, seems oppressively overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep Bad Spirits Away' 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is very little here: an old refrigerator, a particle-board 
dresser and two metal chairs. A wall shelf holds a small black-and-white TV, a 
clock radio, stuffed animals and plastic flowers. 
</P>
<P>
A small Central American herb called a ruda sits on the window sill. She mixes 
its pungent leaves in a drink "when the children are afraid," she explained, 
"and I use it to keep bad spirits away." 
</P>
<P>
A corner of the room has become her "kitchen," which she has tried to spruce up 
by sticking blue contact paper unevenly to the wall. Here she has a hot plate, 
two pots, a frying pan, a strainer and two forks in a glass. 
</P>
<P>
Her $250 rent takes half her monthly welfare money. She has worked, she said, 
as a maid, for $60 a week, and in a garment factory for $90. She stopped four 
years ago when she met the father of her children. He is no longer there. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what happens to all the women," she said, in a matter-of-fact tone. 
"They just leave the women with the children and you have to fend for yourself. 
That's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
On the first of every month she takes the rent money in cash to the lobby. She 
gives it to Adolfo Estrada, a 34-year-old who sits in an office with bars 
facing the lobby, like a cage. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants tend to say he is "malo," the Spanish word for bad, and "mean." Some 
seem genuinely afraid of him. They talk of fights they have had with him, or 
the angry way he reacts when they say something needs repairing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he won't give us the mail," Maria Melgas said. "I ask for the mail 
and he says there's no mail if you don't pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to always pick on the women," added another tenant, Aidee Alcantara. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, for his part, doesn't try to hide his contempt for tenants at the 
Cameo. "I was in one building before in Echo Park," he said vehemently one day. 
"The people were nice. This area is different. Different people. It's more 
difficult." The worst part, he said, is that they are "not clean." 
</P>
<P>
Melgas and Alcantara are friends of Figueroa, visiting back and forth every 
day. When these two attend English classes to meet their amnesty requirements, 
Figueroa takes care of Melgas' baby and Alcantara's 4-year-old. Because she 
came illegally in 1983, fleeing the war after guerrillas wiped out her family's 
crops, Figueroa does not qualify for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
One day, as often happens when they get together, they talk about the building. 
</P>
<P>
"The ceiling is down again," said Melgas, a 30-year-old with five children. 
"Pieces of it are falling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jailed for Wife-Beating 
</P>

Alcantara commented that one of her neighbors was jailed for beating up his 
wife. "But he's getting out today." 
</P>
<P>
They snort derisively at the boric acid the owner has had placed along the 
floorboards to fight cockroaches. They do not believe it works, but Melgas said 
she doesn't buy spray and fight the bugs as Figueroa does. "What can you do? We 
just let them run. They're everywhere. They crawl all over me." 
</P>
<P>
She wonders if this is why "one of my little boys, he's got rashes all over and 
he's losing his hair." 
</P>
<P>
The women call Ben-Horin "Senor Ben" and say they see him around often. He 
tends to wear jeans, an old shirt and work shoes when he's there. His gleaming 
white Mercedes convertible is parked outside. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Horin, 59, bought the building in December, 1987. It was one of 12 Los 
Angeles properties previously owned by Vijaynand Sharma, who had defaulted on 
his loans. 
</P>
<P>
Sharma was convicted in 1987 of the largest number of slum violations in city 
history. He is now a fugitive and has not served any of his 20-month jail 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Horin said most of the properties, including the Cameo, were in bad shape 
when he got them. The former manufacturer, by his estimate, has spent more than 
$300,000 on the Cameo alone, putting in new boilers and a fire sprinkler 
system, relighting the halls and repainting. He needs to spend another $150,000 
to finish repairs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Trial 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the city attorney's civil suit, he still faces trial this summer on 
criminal charges for code violations that were also filed by the city attorney. 
Stephanie Sautner, head of the city's slum housing task force, said the agency 
took the action because "work was proceeding too slowly." 
</P>
<P>
"Too slow by whose standard of measure?" Ben-Horin responded, saying he 
believes that he is being unfairly targeted because he took over buildings 
owned by Sharma, whose case was highly publicized. Given the poor condition of 
the Cameo when he bought it, he believes that he is going as fast as he can. 
</P>
<P>
"There is God and there is the city," he said, exasperated. 
</P>
<P>
City officials often fail to take into account the damage tenants can cause, he 
said, explaining that slum conditions come from both "tenant habits and the 
accumulated failure on the part of the owner to keep up with repairs." 
</P>
<P>
Once repairs are done, he continued, "what it will be in a year's time depends 
on what kind of tenant is there." 
</P>
<P>
In one building he finished repairing last year, several panels of the new 
solar heating system on the roof were smashed and several of the newly 
installed carpets badly stained. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cameo tenants say a lot depends on how well the repairs are done. Some 
of the work in their old building seems purely cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
"It leaks here," Figueroa said, taking a metal rod to poke at her bathroom 
ceiling, which routinely breaks down from leaks. It had been recently repaired, 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"They come, they put a board up there," she said. "It collapses and they come 
and put another board."

POLISH COMMUNISTS' MAIN ALLIES BALK ON NEW LEADER

<P>
The nomination of Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for premier ran into serious trouble in 
the Polish National Assembly on Tuesday as the Communist Party's key coalition 
partners rebelled, expressing no support for him. 
</P>
<P>
A vote on Kiszczak's candidacy had been expected Tuesday but was put off to 
today after the United Peasants' Party, for years a reliable Communist ally, 
emerged from a meeting with no announcement on how the party would cast its 76 
votes, which are essential if Kiszczak, now interior minister, is to be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist parliamentary group, and its newly rebellious allies, were 
meeting late into the night Tuesday in an attempt either to salvage Kiszczak's 
candidacy or come up with an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the outgoing premier, left a 
hospital bed to join the meeting. He was taken to the hospital, aides said, 
after feeling faint Tuesday morning at an anniversary observance of the Warsaw 
Uprising in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing fracas of Polish politics has brought a steady battering to the 
Communists, who had hoped that bringing the Solidarity opposition into the 
National Assembly, through partially free elections, would buy time to shore 
itself up and deal with the country's crisis-ridden economy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Communists have taken on several down-to-the-wire battles, 
including a one-vote margin in Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's election as president 
by the National Assembly, and now the apparent rejection of Jaruzelski's choice 
for premier -- possibly the most blatant parliamentary defiance of a Communist 
leader in East Bloc history. 
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that much of the recent Communist embarrassment has stemmed 
not directly from the opposition, but from within the once tightly controlled 
ranks of Communist allies. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, controlling 161 votes in the Sejm, as the lower house is known, has 
said it will vote against Kiszczak. That decision seemed to be sealed Tuesday 
with a one-line statement issued by Lech Walesa saying: "I am against Gen. 
Kiszczak's candidacy for premier." 
</P>
<P>
The Communists hold 173 seats in the Sejm and must rely on their coalition 
partners, the Peasants, the Democratic Party and a small group of pro-Communist 
Catholics, if they are to put their candidate across. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gasping for Air 
</P>
<P>
Both the Peasants and Democrats have roots going back to prewar Poland. Both 
parties were leftist in their original orientation and, after being first 
suppressed by the Communists after World War II, they were re-formed and 
essentially subsumed by the Communists, who wanted a pliant illusion of a 
multi-party "national front" system. Now, as the Communists gasp for air like 
beached fish, both parties have been eager to distance themselves from their 
domineering partners in order to stake out a future for in the rapidly shifting 
political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Aleksander Benkowski, the Peasants' parliamentary leader, told reporters that 
perhaps as many as 60 members of his own party were rebelling against Kiszczak. 
Other sources said up to 12 Communists had decided to vote against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Peasants' rebellion suggests the possibility of a Solidarity-Peasant Party 
alliance, which would give Solidarity a 237-223 margin in the Sejm -- and 
possibly 28 votes more if the Democratic Party joined in, which seems likely. 
Solidarity already controls the Senate, the upper house of the National 
Assembly, 99 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Such an alliance would lead to increased pressure for a Solidarity government, 
although some key Solidarity leaders have resisted the idea in the past and the 
Communist authorities could be thrown into an even deeper crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upset Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski told Solidarity lawmakers last week that Poland's Communist 
neighbors -- the Soviet Union, East Germany and Czechoslovakia -- would be 
deeply upset with a non-Communist, opposition government running Poland. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Solidarity lawmakers, convened while the Communist coalition 
went into its closed-door emergency session, longtime union activist Jan 
Litynski said the Peasants Party leadership was about to propose a 
Solidarity-led government, with parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek as 
premier and Kazimierz Olesiak as first deputy premier. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist coalition has collapsed after 40 years in power," Litynski said, 
adding that the Peasants Party already had proposed a coalition with 
Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a coalition would have a majority in Parliament," Litynski said, "so the 
last argument against a Solidarity-led government -- that we lack a majority -- 
falls." 
</P>
<P>
While the vote on Kiszczak was delayed, the National Assembly continued debate 
on the Polish economy, and the nation's shoppers gazed with dismay at newly 
raised food prices -- that is, in the few shops where food had not been cleaned 
out in anticipation of the government's "marketization" plan. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to replenish food store shelves by paying more to farm producers, the 
government's plan sent meat prices skyrocketing. A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of ham 
went from 1,600 zlotys ($1.92) to 6,000 ($7.22), an increase of 275%. Pork went 
up 288%. Prices of sugar, flour and butter increased by up to 56%. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers reported that sugar, salt, flour, butter and cheese were unavailable 
in large cities such as Wroclaw, Krakow, Lodz and Poznan. 
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary debate on the economy was triggered by a vote to accept 
Rakowski's resignation as premier. While Rakowski was resting in the hospital, 
his marketization plan was defended by his deputy, Ireneusz Sekula, who claimed 
that "the ship of the Polish economy is right on course." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the situation is exactly the opposite," countered 
Solidarity deputy Ryszard Bugaj. "This ship is sinking." 
</P>
<P>
Another Solidarity deputy, Jan Furtak, said the price rises were "another sign 
of the authorities' arrogance" and argued that state claims of launching a free 
market are contradicted by government procurers who dominate the meat 
processing industry and are free to set any price they choose.

Drug czar William J. Bennett called on parents and churches to spearhead the 
fight against drug addiction and urged tough punishments for casual drug users. 
Bennett, in a taping of television's "Oprah Winfrey Show," said the public 
cannot wait for the federal government to solve the drug problem. Bennett 
called on corporations to fire drug-using employees and he chastised casual 
drug users. "The yuppie taking drugs is part of an international conspiracy," 
Bennett said. "He helps keep drugs on the street. One thing that might cure him 
is to lose that BMW fast." In urging more parental and church involvement, 
Bennett said that although police are able to clear an area of drug dealers, 
the community must step in and reclaim the streets.

Florida state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen won the Republican primary while two 
Democrats headed into a runoff in contests to choose nominees to succeed the 
late Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) in an election that could produce the first 
Cuban-American member of Congress. With all the Republican votes counted, 
Cuban-born Ros-Lehtinen swept to an easy victory with 16,952 votes, or 82.7% of 
the total ballots cast. Her closest challenger was businessman Carlos Perez 
with 2,261, or 11%. In the Democratic contest, former Miami City Commissioner 
Rosario Kennedy and former Florida Bar president Gerald Richman qualified for 
an Aug. 15 runoff. With 98% of the votes counted, Richman had 5,595 votes, or 
28.1%. Kennedy had 5,438 votes, or 27.3%. Federal probation officer Jo Ann 
Pepper, the late congressman's niece, missed the runoff with 4,772 votes, or 
24%.

A special grand jury was impaneled to hear numerous allegations of safety 
violations at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, including the 
illegal dumping of hazardous wastes. Chief U.S. District Judge Sherman G. 
Finesilver told the 23 grand jurors their only task during the 18-month term 
would be "to determine what criminal acts, if any, were committed at Rocky 
Flats nuclear weapons plant." The plant, which manufactures plutonium 
detonators for nuclear weapons, is 16 miles northwest of Denver. About 75 FBI 
agents and special officers from the Environmental Protection Agency raided the 
plant on June 6 after a search warrant was issued on an affidavit containing 
more than 100 pages of allegations. The affidavit accused officials and 
employees of illegally dumping hazardous wastes into streams and altering 
documents.

Argentina announced that it has decided to lift financial and trade 
restrictions on imports from Britain that were imposed during the 1982 Falkland 
Islands War. "As of this date, trade between the two nations will be given the 
same general treatment as trade between any other two nations," a statement 
from the Foreign Ministry said. The decision removed a major stumbling block 
toward re-establishing diplomatic relations between the nations, broken during 
the conflict over the islands. Britain had informed the recently inaugurated 
government of President Carlos Saul Menem that it welcomed concrete steps in 
the area of trade to reflect good faith in an eventual restoration of 
diplomatic relations. Britain ended its trade curbs on Argentina in 1985.

A federal judge in Fresno, who ruled in favor of wine makers Ernest and Julio 
Gallo in a trademark dispute with their brother, Joseph, has been accused by 
Joseph Gallo's lawyer of a conflict of interest in the case. U.S. District 
Judge Robert Coyle ruled June 20 that Joseph Gallo's use of his name on cheese 
he was selling misled the public, because many assumed the brand was connected 
with his brothers' E &amp; J Gallo Winery. Attorney Josph A. Yanny has demanded 
a new trial, saying Coyle was with the law firm that represented the winery 
during settlement of a trademark dispute with Gallo Salami of San Francisco in 
1983, before Coyle became a judge. Coyle denied any conflict, saying he was not 
involved in the Gallo Salami case.

said a group of skinheads is believed to have abducted and beaten Lynn Griffis 
after threatening to kill her. The FBI said it is entering the case because of 
probable violations of federal civil rights statutes. Griffis, a minister in 
the Metropolitan Community Church who has been active in the battle against 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, was also attacked June 12 by an intruder

Colombia, where more than 50 judges have been killed in the last decade, said 
it will increase its protection of the judiciary. Police Gen. Miguel Maza 
Marquez told reporters in Bogota, the capital, that judges handling sensitive 
cases will be given offices inside bases of the national police and the elite 
state security department. His pledge came after about 18,000 judges and 
judicial officials went on strike to press for more protection after the recent 
gangland-style slaying of a colleague.

MICHAEL HARRINGTON, SOCIALIST ACTIVIST AND AUTHOR, DIES AT 61 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Harrington, the salty, irreverent Socialist activist and author who 
inspired the federal government's "War on Poverty" in the mid-1960s, has died 
at his suburban Westchester County (N.Y.) home, it was reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, who lost a four-year battle with cancer of the esophagus, was 61 
when he died Monday in Larchmont. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the classic "The Other America" had gamely continued his work to 
improve the plight of the poor even after surgery and chemotherapy for the 
throat cancer in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
With typical humor, he said that his primary complaint was that doctors 
insisted that he dilute his wine with water and limit himself to three or four 
beers a day. 
</P>
<P>
"As my wife always says," he told the Los Angeles Times in a 1987 interview, 
"beer is one of the few really fine products society has ever produced that's 
within the price range of the working man." 
</P>
<P>
In the last half of his life, Harrington was a prolific writer and lecturer, 
turning out several books and hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles, and 
commanding $2,000 speaking fees throughout the country. He taught political 
science at Queens College in New York, and served as chairman of the party of 
the Old Left, the Democratic Socialists of America. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever his accomplishments in later life, he conceded that his greatest 
fame occurred when he was only 34 and published a book called "The Other 
America" describing the nation's "invisible poor." Its pages at first awakened 
a nation's leaders and then a nation. 
</P>
<P>
A. H. Raskin evaluated the momentous 1962 volume in the New York Times Book 
Review as "a scream of rage, a call to conscience." 
</P>
<P>
Hobart Rowan later observed in the Washington Post: "By writing a book, he 
pricked the conscience of the men in power sufficiently to change the course of 
events." 
</P>
<P>
President John F. Kennedy, greatly moved by the book, proposed that the federal 
government come to the aid of the nation's poor. After Kennedy was 
assassinated, President Lyndon B. Johnson shepherded the proposal, launching 
the War on Poverty in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington was enlisted as a paid consultant in the $1-billion anti-poverty 
program, which fell by the wayside in the midst of military expenditures during 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Kennedy's brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
said: "Michael Harrington never believed that we could not do better and never 
stopped urging us to try harder. My memories of Michael are kaleidoscopic -- a 
charming Irish politician working the floor at a Democratic convention, a 
thundering Old Testament prophet demanding that our country honor its promise 
to the poor and the weak, a worldly intellectual. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Our nation is immensely richer because of his work," Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Michael Harrington was born in St. Louis, Mo., the only child of 
well-to-do Irish Catholic parents, Edward M. Harrington Sr., a patent lawyer, 
and Catherine Fitzgibbon Harrington, a former schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Taft Conservative' 
</P>
<P>
When he attended Holy Cross College, a Jesuit institution in Worcester, Mass., 
Harrington described himself as a "Taft conservative." His political move to 
the left began with a summer job assisting sharecroppers and continued at Yale, 
where he attended a year of law school. 
</P>
<P>
Switching to the University of Chicago, Harrington reveled in philosophical 
discussions at Reader's Drugstore and the University Tavern, later recalling 
that his colleagues there "had been talking and reading for years. I read like 
a madman to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
He earned his master's degree in English literature in 1949, horrifying his 
family by announcing that he wanted to become a poet rather than a lawyer like 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington's initiation to the underclass of poor that he was to write about 
included jobs in the 1950s as a social worker in St. Louis, and in New York as 
associate editor of the Catholic Worker, and staff member of St. Joseph's House 
of Hospitality, a settlement house aiding Bowery derelicts. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington also began his political work in the early 1950s, as an organizer 
and speaker for the Young Socialist League on college campuses and as a regular 
at bohemian gathering places in Greenwich Village where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Became an Atheist 
</P>
<P>
The more he saw of poverty, the further he moved away from his Catholicism, 
later declaring himself an atheist. 
</P>
<P>
"Why else would most people on this Earth be born to a life less than human?" 
he explained in 1987. "What kind of God is that?" 
</P>
<P>
After publishing "The Other America," Harrington produced more than a dozen 
other works, including "The Accidental Century" (1965), "Toward a Democratic 
Left" (1968), "Socialism" (1972), "Fragments of the Century" (1974), "Twilight 
of Capitalism" (1976), "The Vast Majority: A Journey to the World's Poor" 
(1977), "Decade of Decision: The Crisis of the American System" (1980), "The 
Next America: The Decline and Rise of the United States" (1981), "The New 
American Poverty" (1984), and "Taking Sides: The Education of a Militant Mind" 
(1985). 
</P>
<P>
His most recent books include "Socialism: Past and Future" this year and a 
second volume of memoirs, "The Long-Distance Runner," published in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He was a key leader and spokesman for the Democratic Socialists of America and 
a respected intellectual who spent several weeks a year traveling abroad as 
America's representative at global conferences of the Socialist International. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 alone he was in West Germany, Spain, Botswana, Peru and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout a prolific career, even his critics were repeatedly struck by 
Harrington's regular-guy demeanor and reasoned approach to radical political 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Journalist and author Alden Whitman described him as "an articulate and 
astonishingly readable watered-down Marxist. . . . Unlike many of the 
soothsayers around, Harrington makes sense most of the time. . . ." Writer 
Marion Magid marveled that "the oddest thing . . . was that he was not at all . 
. . eccentric." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington clearly enjoyed taking his critics by surprise, telling the Times 
interviewer two years ago: "I am also very conscious of the fact that what most 
people, and the media especially, expects a Socialist to be is a wild man. They 
want a real nut, some screwball who'll stand up and shout, 'Hell with 
everything! Let's tear this joint down! . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Can Convince Them' 
</P>
<P>
"Give me half an hour with damned near anybody," he continued, "and I can 
convince them that I am in the real world, a serious person with some smart 
answers to plenty of practical problems plaguing this society -- not just some 
wild-eyed dreamer." 
</P>
<P>
Although he championed the poor, Harrington was not among them, born to comfort 
and in his later years earning more than $80,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Socialist Leader Flees to Westchester," twitted one New York newspaper when he 
moved his wife, free-lance writer Stephanie Gervis whom he married in 1963, and 
their two sons to Larchmont, in affluent Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to being called everything from a hare-brained hypocrite to a pinko 
traitor, Harrington said: 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of people who think that, if you've written books on 
poverty, then you should be poor too. And that's garbage! Friedrich Engels was 
a businessman, for crissake! And Karl Marx lived in poverty for part of his 
life, but eventually moved out, in effect, to the suburbs so that his daughters 
could meet some eligible guys to marry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poverty Actually Stinks' 
</P>
<P>
"My point is, I don't want to be Jesus, or even Gandhi. I am not a Franciscan. 
Even when I was at the Catholic Worker, I hated the lousy food, the bedbugs, 
the smells -- poverty actually stinks, did you know that? 
</P>
<P>
"Closed-off buildings, reeking with the odors of food, urine. . . . Anyway, 
you'd have to be an absolute nut to want to live like that. I'm willing to put 
up with it, if necessary, but I happen to like nice food, good wine. . . . And 
I've never made any secret of it." 
</P>
<P>
Dismissed by many as a utopian dreamer, Harrington wrote candidly in his 
collection of essays "Taking Sides" that: "I see no possibility that socialists 
will play a major role in leading a mass movement in the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he remained optimistic as well as pragmatic, telling The Times in 1987: 
"Yeah, maybe we're dreamers -- but if human beings can only begin to just 
imagine total perfection today, then they will at least be that much closer to 
achieving it tomorrow. If I go to bed tonight, for instance, dreaming my 
utopian dreams, then maybe I will be just that much closer to having some very 
good, practical ideas on how to design a health or housing program at 9 a.m. 
tomorrow morning, which might at least benefit those most in need, those at the 
very bottom of our society."

ENERGY DEPT. WANTS TO SPEND $19.5 BILLION BY 1995 TO CLEAN UP ITS NUCLEAR 
FACILITIES 
</P>

<P>
The Energy Department, in an effort to address years of neglect at the nation's 
atomic weapons plants, called Tuesday for spending $19.5 billion by 1995 to 
clean up environmental problems and safety hazards at production facilities 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The clean-up plan would have a significant impact on the federal budget. 
Currently, less than $2 billion a year is spent on such efforts. Under the 
department's proposal, spending would escalate to $4 billion in fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job to Take 30 Years 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said that the "imaginative and unusual plan" 
ultimately would cost far more than $19.5 billion because it would take 30 
years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
But he provided no estimate of the total cost. He said only that previous 
forecasts of $150 billion over 50 years involved "too much money and too much 
time." 
</P>
<P>
In remarks at the National Press Club, Watkins said that his 30-year plan "will 
seem like too long to some people and unattainable to others. But we believe 
that it is as close to being realistic as we can get." 
</P>
<P>
The secretary, preparing for what is sure to be a lively debate in Congress 
over the proposed funding levels, said that the nuclear weapons system's 
problems are so severe and have been neglected for so long that high costs are 
unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, the (Energy Department) suffers from a lack of investment in the 
infrastructure and facilities that any good business must make to stay 
healthy," Watkins said. "If we were graded for quality control, we would not 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
A number of facilities, including major weapons plants in Colorado and Ohio, 
have been the subject of investigations by both the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the FBI. Operations at some key plants have been shut down because 
of safety and environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $19.5 billion would be used at 17 nuclear weapons plants in a dozen 
states, but some money would be allocated for clean-up efforts at more than 70 
other government nuclear facilities, most of which have long been shut down, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Among heavily contaminated sites targeted by the clean-up plan are the Rocky 
Flats plutonium processing plant near Denver, the Savannah River weapons plant 
in South Carolina, the Hanford Reservation in eastern Washington state, the 
Fernald uranium processing plant in Ohio, the Oak Ridge Reservation in 
Tennessee and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated that about $1 billion would be devoted over the next five 
years to repairing equipment and correcting conditions to bring the facilities 
into compliance with federal and state environment and health laws. An 
additional $9 billion would be earmarked for cleaning contaminated sites of 
radioactive or otherwise hazardous wastes. And another $9 billion would be used 
to develop future waste management operations. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins called for states to work with the Energy Department in reaching 
compromise agreements to clean up hazardous waste at weapons plants that are 
not in compliance with environmental and safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do it in a fiscally responsible way and not put everybody in jail 
because we're out of compliance today with the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He hailed recent compliance agreements that the Energy Department has reached 
with top officials in Washington state and Colorado to clean up the Hanford and 
Rocky Flats facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Energy Department is developing plans to move nuclear waste to new 
sites in Nevada and New Mexico for storage, Watkins said he hopes that 
eventually most of the waste could be stored at production sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to do everything scientifically feasible to solve (waste) problems 
in place and not transfer problems from one hole in the ground to another hole 
in the ground," he said. "Previously, the principal waste management strategy 
has been to leave contaminants in the ground until the money or muscle could be 
found to dig them up in one place and then move them somewhere else . . . . 
This is very expensive and only postpones the long-term storage of these 
toxics." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said that his "highest waste technology priority, one I am challenging 
our national labs to solve, is how to treat such contamination without moving 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins disclosed that the controversial Rocky Flats plant came within hours 
last Friday of being forced to shut down because radioactive wastes were found 
stored in violation of EPA regulations. But an agreement was reached on how to 
deal with the drums.

CLAIMED HE WAS 'POLITICAL PRISONER' IN BEIJING, SOURCES SAY;

<P>
REP. SAVAGE REPORTEDLY DISRUPTED TRIP TO CHINA

Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.), who has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman 
Peace Corps volunteer on a trip to Zaire, also disrupted a congressional trip 
to China in 1986 by declaring that he was being held "a political prisoner" in 
Beijing, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Savage, 64, a five-term congressman from Chicago, caused such a ruckus during 
the trip to China that officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing later dubbed it 
"Codel FUBAR" for "congressional delegation (fouled) up beyond all 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met Women in Disco 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Savage clashed with Chinese security personnel at the 
prestigious Diaoyutai State Guest House by trying to bring two women he 
reportedly had met at a Beijing disco back to his room one night. 
</P>
<P>
Savage, whose activities in Zaire are under investigation by the House Ethics 
Committee, could not be reached for comment on the accounts of his behavior in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me.), ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs 
subcommittee on international operations, has asked the State Department to 
provide the Ethics Committee with cable messages relating to any incidents 
involving Savage on any official international trip. She said that she had 
acted on information that the incident in Zaire was not an isolated case. 
</P>
<P>
Savage was one of eight members of Congress who went to China in November, 
1986, on a trip sponsored by the National People's Congress, the legislature of 
China. He and other House members were scheduled to meet with many top-level 
Chinese government officials in Beijing before touring several other Chinese 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't Attend Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Sources who witnessed Savage's behavior said that the congressman apparently 
became disappointed with the trip's itinerary shortly after arriving in Beijing 
and refused to attend many of the meetings with Chinese officials. 
</P>
<P>
One night, according to witnesses, Savage returned to his guest house about 
midnight with two women he had met in a disco. He identified them as 
"constituents" from his South Side Chicago district and demanded that he be 
permitted to take them to his room. 
</P>
<P>
Savage protested loudly when Chinese security officials sought to bar the women 
from entering the tightly guarded complex. One source recalls seeing him 
"raising hell at the guard station." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tomsen, then deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Beijing, eventually 
convinced Savage that the women could not stay at the guest house, and they 
were driven back to their hotels in an official car about 3 a.m., sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the congressional delegation left Beijing to fly to Xian, one source 
said, Savage demanded assurances that, if he went along to Xian, he could then 
leave the country, missing all of the other stops that were planned for the 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
When he did not receive such assurances, sources said, he declared that he was 
being held "a political prisoner" and threatened to disrupt a meeting of the 
delegation with Chinese State Councilor Song Jian by protesting his treatment. 
Sources said that Savage was dissuaded from making a scene at the meeting by 
two of his congressional colleagues, Reps. Jim Moody (D-Wis.) and Edolphus (Ed) 
Towns (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
One witness recalls seeing Savage "ranting and raving" about his complaints 
while standing outside the Great Hall of the People just before the meeting 
with Song. Later that day, after other members of the delegation had flown on 
to Xian without him, sources said, Savage "barricaded" himself in his room and 
refused to come out. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, sources said, Savage was persuaded by Tomsen to leave the guest 
house, and U.S. officials arranged to get him on a plane to Hong Kong that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Tomsen refused to comment on the story. 
</P>
<P>
Savage's behavior did not go unnoticed by his Chinese hosts. After he left the 
country, sources said, a very senior Chinese official told a U.S. Embassy 
official: "No Chinese official would ever do anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Congress traveling with Savage were former Rep. Manuel Lujan 
Jr. (D-N. M.), now secretary of the Interior, and Reps. Peter H. Kostmayer 
(D-Pa.), Thomas M. Foglietta (D-Pa.), James H. Scheuer (D-N.Y.) and Jim Bates 
(D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
One source who has gone on many congressional overseas junkets said that 
Savage's behavior in China was the worst that he has ever seen.

OIL TANKERS WOULD HAVE TWO ESCORTS UNDER NEW SAFETY PLAN

Loaded oil tankers leaving Alaska will be accompanied by oil spill response 
vessels under a plan submitted by the industry Tuesday to meet state demands 
for a spill response following the Exxon Valdez disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The new Tanker Spill Prevention and Response Plan for Prince William Sound will 
guarantee that spill response vessels and equipment will be ready to respond 
immediately to a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez, said Nick Mitchell, a BP 
Shipping Co. official who coordinated development of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is expected to cost the oil industry $45 million annually, was 
developed for the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which operates the trans-Alaska 
oil pipeline and Valdez terminal for its seven oil company owners. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska is obligated to mount the initial response to any tanker spill and has 
come under attack for its response to the Exxon spill before the company 
initiated its own effort. 
</P>
<P>
But while promising to be ready to fight the next spill, Alyeska stopped short 
of promising any better results. 
</P>
<P>
"If the question is, can we guarantee that we can pick up an 11-million-gallon 
spill, the answer is no, we can't guarantee it," Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan 
said.

SOVIET RAILWAYS RUN NORMALLY DESPITE EARLIER STRIKE THREATS

The Soviet Railroad Ministry said trains were running normally Tuesday -- an 
apparent victory for officials and radical reformers who had urged railroad 
workers not to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no interruptions in the work of the railways. They are all working 
according to schedule," said a spokesman for the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 1 was first mentioned as a date for a rail strike more than a week ago, 
and it took on extra weight over the weekend when leading Soviet newspapers 
warned that such a strike could bring chaos and catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
But checks with other regional centers that had figured in the reports of 
possible labor trouble -- including the Armenian capital of Yerevan and the 
Byelorussian industrial center of Vitebsk -- showed business as normal. 
</P>
<P>
"There were rumors but all trains are working," said a spokeswoman for the 
Armenian news agency Armenpress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev Appeal Noted 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial reports reaching Moscow said Ukrainian workers had been holding 
informal strike meetings and that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had appealed 
to them through the Railroad Ministry. These reports could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily Pravda said Sunday that reporters in Leningrad had 
been told of "debates going on for several days . . . and calls for a rail 
strike" along the giant Oktyabr rail network covering the northwest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Radicals Call for Restraint 
</P>
<P>
Radical deputies in the Soviet Parliament, meeting over the weekend, joined in 
the call for restraint, saying that a rail stoppage on top of a miners' strike 
just settled could be used as a pretext to halt reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The nightly television news broadcast Monday devoted 10 full minutes to a 
report on measures taken by outgoing Railroad Minister Nikolai S. Konarev to 
forestall a strike. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat who monitors the Soviet economy said the media campaign was 
aimed at reassuring the country that everything was being done to prevent a 
strike, which could cripple an economy already reeling from enormous deficits, 
wide-spread inefficiency and sluggish growth.

They said Bae Yoon A, 7, was flying to visit her father, a Samsung Construction 
Co. official based in Tripoli, when the plane crashed on landing. Airline 
officials said Bae died while receiving treatment for severe burns. Bae's

Is this a symbol of resurgent protest, a grim reminder of the bloody night of 
June 3-4, when martial law troops shot their way into the capital, killing 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy protesters who sought to block 
their path? Are authorities now hunting down whoever dared to create this 
design? 
</P>
<P>
No. Quite the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
As authorities try to rewrite the history of what happened that June night, the 
design of an AK-47 in front of Tian An Men has literally become a badge of 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presented to Soldiers 
</P>
<P>
The design is on a new medal presented to the soldiers who now occupy Beijing. 
It was issued under the direct authority of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and 
bears characters in Deng's calligraphy: "Guardian of the capital." Over the 
past few days, pictures of the badge have appeared in all the major media. 
</P>
<P>
The new badge is one more tool in an intense propaganda campaign that has been 
building for more than a month, reaching a new peak with Army Day celebrations 
marking the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
"During the brave struggle to quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion, 
relations between the army and the people that are as close as the relation of 
fish and water were fully displayed," declared an editorial Tuesday in the 
official newspaper People's Daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they were facing cruel thugs, our soldiers, in order not to 
accidentally injure onlookers, restrained themselves again and again," the 
editorial continued. "Some soldiers, in order to avoid even greater bloodshed, 
got beaten or even gave their lives. By their acts they have proven that the 
People's Liberation Army is really a benevolent, just and civilized army." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newspaper Promotes Theme 
</P>
<P>
A half page of photographs and drawings in the People's Daily promoted the same 
theme, with cheerful soldiers greeting children, chatting with Beijing 
residents or sprucing up the landscaping around Tian An Men. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the television news has shown soldiers being entertained by 
performers and receiving flowers from children or gifts of food from peasants. 
An exhibition presenting the government's view of this spring's protests and 
the events of early June opened Monday at the military museum. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, every major newspaper ran editorials praising the army. 
</P>
<P>
"The guns of the People's Liberation Army point only at enemies at home and 
abroad, and will never be directed at the people," declared the Economic Daily 
in an editorial entitled, "Glory Belongs to the People's Soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Had No Choice but to Fire' 
</P>
<P>
"In suppressing the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army had no choice but 
to open fire on the counterrevolutionary rioters," the editorial added. "The 
army was carrying out its duties. In short, it was done to cherish and protect 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
The combination of force and propaganda has brought a surface calm to Beijing, 
but the city is far from normal. Two months after the crackdown, young soldiers 
still stand at intersections, bridges and outside embassy compounds with AK-47 
semiautomatic assault rifles and shorter, black machine pistols. Some look 
nervous, others hot and bored, while the lucky ones are in groups where they 
can chat with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Vehicular traffic, including bicycles, can pass by Tian An Men Square. But 
anyone trying to walk past the square -- which was the center of last spring's 
seven-week pro-democracy movement -- is still stopped by soldiers with the 
ubiquitous AK-47. Only specially approved groups can enter the square to view 
the monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Late at night vehicles, including those of diplomats, are still stopped at 
military roadblocks. Soldiers demand identification of passengers and often 
check trunks for weapons or fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Resentful 
</P>
<P>
Chinese residents of Beijing, when they think it is safe to do so, still 
privately express deep resentment of military control in their city. But the 
show of military strength and the propaganda barrage have put effective limits 
on public discourse by Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
A large segment of Beijing's diplomatic community, however, managed to make a 
quiet protest when diplomats from the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia 
and Western Europe boycotted a reception held at the Great Hall of the People 
to honor the army. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from many African, South American, Eastern Bloc and Asian nations 
attended the event. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese press Tuesday made no mention of the boycott. But Defense Minister 
Qin Jiwei, in a toast, declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to state solemnly here that the Chinese people and the People's 
Liberation Army have never yielded to outside pressure, nor will they in the 
future. We advise those who remain hostile to China to take a long view and not 
to do anything that would again hurt the national feelings of the Chinese 
people and harm their normal relations with China."

SOARING OPIUM OUTPUT, PURITY OF PRODUCT COULD SPAWN A NEW CRISIS

Spurred by a worldwide "explosion" in opium production, heroin of unprecedented 
purity has started to show up on the streets of some East Coast cities, 
prompting growing fears that the nation may be on the verge of a new wave of 
heroin abuse that could rival the crack epidemic, federal officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
David Westrate, assistant administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
said a study of street samples in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Newark, 
N.J., found that bags of Southeast Asian heroin were being sold at average 
purities of between 48% and 51% -- more than five times the potency 
traditionally injected by heroin addicts. 
</P>
<P>
The high purities are particularly frightening because they make it much easier 
to smoke heroin -- a practice being reported with increasing frequency among 
crack addicts seeking to modulate the intense highs of their crack use, 
Westrate told the House Select Committee on Narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Westrate said the "driving stimulus" behind the heroin revival has been a 
global glut caused by dramatic surges in opium production in Southeast Asia, 
Southwest Asia and Mexico. "All three growing areas are going full blast," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is further complicated because the United States has little or no 
influence in most of the countries where the increases are occurring -- Laos, 
Myanmar (formerly Burma), Afghanistan and Iran, said Melvyn Levitksy, assistant 
secretary for state for international narcotics matters.

NEW TACTIC AGAINST SLUMS: TAKING THE RENT MONEY AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attacking what Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called "the mother's milk of 
slumlordism, the rent check," a new Los Angeles ordinance allows the city to 
take rent money away from landlords who refuse to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Passed last November at the urging of Yaroslavsky and Councilwoman Gloria 
Molina, the ordinance gives the City Council the right to place either certain 
apartments or whole buildings into a "rent escrow account program." It is 
similar to laws already enacted in New York and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants then pay their monthly rents into a special bank account maintained by 
the city, rather than to their landlords. Landlords get the money only after 
they make repairs, minus a $50-per-apartment fee to the city. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the city's Community Development Department, which administers the 
program, is considering three buildings as candidates for the rent escrow 
program -- at 521 S. Union Drive, 5426 Virginia Ave. and 1040 Westlake Ave.

FRANCES WOODWORTH WRIGHT; INSTRUCTOR IN CELESTIAL NAVIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frances Woodworth Wright, 92, a Harvard University astronomer who taught 
celestial navigation to Navy officers. During more than half a century of 
research and teaching, Miss Wright's studies ranged from investigating specks 
of cosmic dust called spherules to calculating the brightness of galaxies and 
developing efforts to observe comets and meteors. Her special interest was 
celestial navigation, the guiding of ships by the stars. Among her students 
were Army engineers and Navy officers enrolled in special courses during World 
War II. She also taught Harvard undergraduates and weekend sailors and wrote 
three books on sailing by the stars. Miss Wright taught astronomy and 
mathematics at Elmira College in New York before going to Harvard in 1928 to 
serve as an assistant to a succession of prominent astronomers, including 
Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, Harlow Shapley and Fred Whipple. In Cambridge, Mass.,

2 TREASURER CANDIDATES RAISE MORE THAN $1 MILLION 
</P>

The two leading candidates for the office of state treasurer, Republican 
incumbent Thomas W. Hayes and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown, raised a 
total of more than $1 million in campaign funds during the first half of 1989, 
contribution reports showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In another statewide race, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner collected 
$616,000 in his quest to become attorney general -- nearly four times the 
$156,000 raised by his closest opponent, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, 
the reports showed. Both are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for the newly elective post of insurance commissioner got off to a 
modest start with Democratic television commentator Bill Press raising $104,000 
and Roxani Gillespie, the current appointed insurance commissioner, collecting 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, fund-raising reports filed this week indicated that the 
campaign restrictions of Proposition 73 have done little to reduce the ability 
of politicians to raise money. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
for example, reported collecting $696,000 during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of fund-raising in the treasurer's race demonstrates that the 1990 
campaign is certain to be a hard-fought contest for what was once considered a 
relatively minor state office. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., raised $676,000 for her 
campaign during the six-month period -- more than any candidate seeking a 
statewide office other than governor. But in an interview, Brown still 
portrayed her campaign as an uphill battle against Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
"I still see my candidacy as being one of an underdog, given the fact there is 
someone sitting in that office," she said. "I really am going to have a 
formidable challenge but I am working hard to equalize (Hayes') advantage by 
raising enough money to run a very credible and viable campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who was appointed treasurer last year by Gov. George Deukmejian, 
collected $383,000 during the same period for his first campaign for elective 
office. But a spokeswoman said Hayes is not worried about Brown's early 
fund-raising edge. 
</P>
<P>
"We will raise what it takes to get the message out there, to show the 
difference between the candidates," said Donna Lucas, a spokeswoman for Hayes. 
"We're happy with the amount of money that we've raised." 
</P>
<P>
Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine, a second Republican candidate in the race, 
trails Hayes with contributions of $156,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the attorney general campaign, Republican Daniel E. Lungren lags far behind 
both Democrats in fund-raising. Lungren, a former congressman from Long Beach 
whose appointment to the treasurer's post was rejected by the Legislature 
before Hayes got the job, raised only $29,000 in his bid to become the state's 
top law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for lieutenant governor, two Orange County Republican state 
senators, John Seymour and Marian Bergeson, each raised more than incumbent Lt. 
Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who is seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, of Anaheim, reported $354,000 while Bergeson, of Newport Beach, raised 
$363,000. However, $225,000 of the sum Bergeson reported was actually money she 
raised before 1989 for her state Senate campaign and transferred this year into 
her lieutenant governor account. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, a Democrat who was defeated in his attempt to oust U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson last year, has raised $222,000 for his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In the state Senate, both President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) 
and Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno reported raising substantial sums. 
Roberti reported raising $308,000, while Maddy collected $353,000 during the 
first half of the year.

REPORT DOWNPLAYS THE IMPORTANCE OF HDTV TO INDUSTRY 
</P>

<P>
High-definition television, touted as the next wave in electronics, might not 
be a big enough breakthrough to restore competitiveness to the American 
industry, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The findings triggered immediate criticism from an industry trade group and 
congressmen who support increased federal funding to develop the new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
HDTV, which produces a picture as sharp as movies and has many potential 
applications, has become an international issue, with the 12-nation European 
Community asking the United States to help head off any Japanese effort to 
control the field. 
</P>
<P>
But the CBO study questioned HDTV's potential impact on consumer electronics 
and said any federal support should have other justifications, such as job 
creation, national prestige and scientific advancement. 
</P>
<P>
CBO Director Robert Reichauer told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on 
Tuesday that private estimates of HDTV sales were based largely on the premiums 
consumers were willing to pay in the past for color television over 
black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
But he questioned whether consumers would pay the price for a high-definition 
television -- in excess of $2,000, some experts say -- when the picture quality 
of standard televisions still is improving. 
</P>
<P>
Reichauer also questioned whether HDTV would be the instant success some 
predict, saying even such successful products as videocassette recorders and 
microwave ovens caught on slowly. 
</P>
<P>
He told the committee that even the optimistic predictions for HDTV sales were 
small in relation to the overall electronics market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Direct Route 
</P>
<P>
"It is unlikely that HDTV will pay a pivotal role in the competitiveness and 
technology development of the sector as a whole," Reichauer said. "Exactly how 
the HDTV market would change the competitiveness of U.S. producers on the whole 
is unclear." 
</P>
<P>
Reichauer said it was laudable to try to cut the U.S. trade deficit by 
fostering HDTV but that reducing the budget deficit and thereby raising 
national savings was a more direct route toward ending the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) and Don Ritter (R-Pa.), co-chairmen of the 
congressional HDTV caucus, called the CBO report "dangerous nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said the United States already lagged behind its top competitors in HDTV 
development, with foreign countries spending billions of dollars to develop 
their industries. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the CBO really know something that has escaped Japan, Europe and the vast 
majority of American experts, all of whom say that HDTV is critical?" Levine 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
The American Electronics Assn., which represents 3,500 high-technology 
companies, said the report contained erroneous assumptions and flawed 
conclusions.

ECONOMY WILL SKIRT RECESSION THIS YEAR, GREENSPAN PREDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite fresh signs of a weakening economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on 
Tuesday that he is still confident the economy can be brought in for a "soft 
landing" in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The information we have to date is favorable," Greenspan said. "I think we 
will make it." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan confirmed that the Federal Reserve had eased its credit reins last 
week for the third time since early June. The Fed injected funds into the 
banking system to encourage a key interest rate to dip a quarter of a 
percentage point to 9%. The "federal funds" rate -- the interest that banks 
charge each other on overnight loans -- hit a peak of about 9.8% in late May. 
</P>
<P>
Under the "soft landing" scenario that a number of Wall Street analysts believe 
is unfolding this year, the Fed's 16-month credit tightening campaign, which 
lasted through May, should help curb rising inflation without plunging the 
nation into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts expect a downturn to begin later this year or early in 1990. 
They contend that the economy is on the verge of a "hard landing" that will 
sharply boost unemployment and make it impossible for the government to cut 
next year's budget deficit substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to such fears were two reports issued Tuesday, one showing that 
construction spending fell by 0.8% in June and another showing that for the 
third straight month, an index calculated by the National Assn. of Purchasing 
Agents fell in July below the 50% threshold that signals whether industrial 
activity is growing or contracting. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, however, reiterated the Fed's consensus that the economy will skirt 
a recession during the next year, stating that central bankers are aiming at 
modest growth of about 2% to 2.5% this year, followed by an anemic 1.5% to 2% 
gain in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, who had testified on monetary policy to a House subcommittee in 
July, said the Fed's policy "is on the right track," contending that the 
decision to begin pushing up interest rates last year has "succeeded in 
defusing inflationary pressures." 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that it is too early to tell whether the Fed's recent "backing 
off" from its tight credit stance will achieve "an ideal configuration for the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, who has repeatedly warned that the nation's chief economic problem 
is its low savings rate, disclosed that the Fed has launched a study of 
possible policy initiatives to help encourage higher levels of U.S. savings and 
investment. The Bush Administration is working on similar studies, but 
Greenspan warned lawmakers not to expect easy solutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes Funding Plan 
</P>
<P>
With the Fed moving to lower interest rates over the past two months, most 
senators were less interested in challenging Greenspan on monetary policy than 
in soliciting his views on recent legislative controversies. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman repeated his opposition to funding provisions contained in the 
savings and loan bailout plan adopted by a House-Senate conference committee, 
which agreed last week to exempt the initial $50 billion in borrowing costs 
from the deficit ceiling imposed by the Gramm-Rudman budget law. 
</P>
<P>
The financing scheme -- also opposed by the Bush Administration on the grounds 
that it would open the door to future efforts to avoid Gramm-Rudman limits -- 
is expected to be debated in the House and Senate this week. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan termed the $1 billion to $1.5 billion in extra up-front costs needed 
to generate the funds for the bailout through an alternative off-budget 
financing scheme a "very small insurance policy" that is worth paying to keep 
Gramm-Rudman intact. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, asked by Sen. Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.) whether the S&amp;L bill 
threatened to turn Gramm-Rudman from a "steel band" into a "rubber band," 
Greenspan replied: "I'm concerned it may be no band."

The first grand jury indictments will be returned today in the government's 
extraordinary three-year-long undercover investigation of alleged fraud at the 
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two

</P>
<P>
Dozens of traders and brokers at the two exchanges will be charged with 
offenses ranging from racketeering to fraud, defense lawyers said. The 
indictments are the result of one of the most elaborate FBI stings and one of 
the most wide-ranging federal probes ever of white-collar crime.

To penetrate the little-policed and widely utilized Chicago futures markets, 
FBI agents with fabricated identities worked for months as traders in the 
noisy, frenetic trading pits. The undercover agents not only traded but also 
befriended traders, socializing with them and surreptitiously making electronic 
recordings documenting alleged illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the significance of the indictments, top federal officials are 
scheduled to join Chicago's U.S. attorney, Anton R. Valukas, in announcing the 
charges, the first government acknowledgement of the investigation. Sources 
close to the investigation said they will include Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, 
FBI Director William S. Sessions and Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
Chairwoman Wendy L. Gramm. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives you an idea of the magnitude of these cases," said veteran 
commodities lawyer James A. McGurk, a former federal prosecutor and former CFTC 
Midwest regional senior trial counsel. "It's unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
Traders and brokers are expected to be charged with a wide range of offenses, 
including making illegal trades to reduce their income tax liability, making 
prearranged trades at non-market prices, and "front running," or executing 
trades for their own accounts in advance of trading for their customers' 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Targets of the investigation are traders and brokers working in the soybean and 
Treasury bond pits at the Chicago Board of Trade and in the Japanese yen and 
Swiss franc pits at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The soybean and Treasury 
bond pits are two of the three busiest at the Board of Trade, while the 
currency pits at the Mercantile Exchange are two of the most volatile. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that, in addition to the indictments, a small number of other 
traders will be accused of felonies and misdemeanors in criminal informations, 
a sign that these persons have cooperated with federal investigators and have 
negotiated plea agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"There have not been widespread defections to the government side," said a 
defense lawyer familiar with the investigation. Other sources said the 
government has been frustrated by the large number of traders who invoked the 
Fifth Amendment when questioned by the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Several other traders are expected to be barred from participating in 
commodities trading for years under terms of an agreement they have worked out 
with the CFTC as part of a negotiated settlement of violations of that agency's 
rules. The extent of the CFTC's role in the investigation has been a mystery 
since word of the probe became public in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Facing Quadruple Jeopardy' 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Justice Department and CFTC, brokers and traders implicated 
in the federal investigation also face disciplinary action by the exchanges 
themselves and by the National Futures Assn., which registers brokers and 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
"Those implicated are facing quadruple jeopardy," McGurk said. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of what awaits those implicated in the federal investigation came 
Tuesday when the Wall Street Journal disclosed that four traders in the 
Mercantile Exchange's yen pit who traded with undercover FBI agents have been 
charged in an internal investigation by the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the investigation said Brian E. Sledz, his younger 
brother James, James Cali and Thomas A. Crouch have all been charged with 
engaging in prearranged trading. Cali and Crouch have also been accused of 
failing to cooperate with the exchange's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Mercantile Exchange refused to confirm or comment on the 
pending cases. But other sources said the investigation of the four began Jan. 
20, the same day that the federal undercover investigation surfaced in news 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Sledz, who sold his exchange membership for $350,000 in January, sued the 
Mercantile Exchange earlier this year after the proceeds were frozen pending 
the internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, federal investigators reportedly asked the exchanges not to 
conduct their own internal investigation until the government probe was 
concluded. Federal authorities had no comment on the Mercantile Exchange's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation has been controversial from the moment it surfaced in 
a Chicago newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both exchanges criticized the government for using undercover 
agents to penetrate their arcane world. Defense lawyers criticized the late 
night and early morning visits by Justice Department lawyers and FBI agents to 
subpoena witnesses who were often threatened with Draconian charges if they did 
not agree to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
The government was also criticized for threatening to use the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, against commodities traders. 
Conviction on RICO charges can result in government seizure of assets, 
including cars, homes and bank accounts. The first successful prosecution under 
the law in a securities case came Monday in New York with the conviction of six 
persons in the Princeton/Newport Limited Partnership case. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling by a federal judge last week allowing the government to use tape 
recordings made surreptitiously in the trading pits by undercover FBI agents 
cleared the way for this week's indictments. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John Grady turned back a challenge by defense lawyers who 
claimed the tapes were made illegally because they violated the privacy rights 
of some traders who were overheard in the tapes. The judge rejected the 
argument.

Ford Motor Co., acknowledging that U.S. vehicle sales would "hit the skids" 
without buyer lures, announced Tuesday yet another incentive program designed 
to clear its remaining inventories of 1989 models. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which replaces one that expired July 31, raises the cash rebates 
on several car and truck lines, with $1,000 or more offered on 21 models and 
between $300 to $750 back on 13 others. 
</P>
<P>
The rebates are paid directly from Ford to car buyers, with no dealer 
participation required, the No. 2 car maker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Incentives are a way of life. . . . Everybody's in the game," said Thomas 
Wagner, general manager of the Ford division. "Nobody can figure out how to get 
away from them without the market hitting the skids for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Estimates Lowered 
</P>
<P>
Ford follows industry leader General Motors Corp. and third-ranked Chrysler 
Corp. in sweetening buyer promotions that were last changed in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the better deals -- which have cut heavily into auto makers' 
profits -- U.S. car and truck sales have been declining this year, forcing 
industry executives to lower earlier estimates from more than 15 million units 
to about 14.7 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of bet on the market earlier this year, but it has not jumped as we 
thought it would," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 15.8 million cars and trucks, including imports, were sold in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ford announced that its Atlanta assembly plant will be idled from 
Aug. 7 through Aug. 16 because of slow dealer orders.

MAI HIKES BID FOR PRIME UNIT TO $525 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MAI Basic Four, hoping to keep alive its chances of acquiring Prime Computer's 
minicomputer business, on Tuesday revised its offer for the operation to $525 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, MAI offered $450 million in cash and notes with a face value of 
$150 million for the unit. Analysts said the new all-cash offer probably will 
be more attractive to Prime's lenders, however, because of the uncertain market 
value of the securities that MAI had offered. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a Tustin computer maker controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, 
recently dropped its nine-month effort to buy all of Prime. Instead, it is 
seeking to purchase only Prime's minicomputer business, which accounts for 
one-third of the Natick, Mass., computer company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whitney Offer Snagged 
</P>
<P>
Prime has rebuffed all of MAI's previous overtures, and on June 23 it agreed to 
be acquired by J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New York venture capital firm, in a 
deal valued at $1.4 billion. The Whitney buyout hit a snag last week, however, 
when Chemical Bank in New York and First National Bank of Boston asked Whitney 
to raise more financing because of Prime's deteriorating financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's request came one day before Prime reported a $19-million loss for 
the quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney has said it is negotiating with potential lenders to try to raise the 
additional financing. Donald Ackerman, a Whitney general partner, declined to 
comment Tuesday on efforts to secure that financing. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have said that Whitney's financing difficulties could help MAI's 
chances of buying the minicomputer business. 
</P>
<P>
MAI said in a prepared statement that it amended its offer, which expires Aug. 
9, "with a view to simplifying the choices available" to Prime's directors and 
shareholders. A company spokeswoman declined further comment, 
</P>
<P>
Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said the company's board would meet to review 
MAI's new offer.

SIMMONS ADDS TO HOLDINGS IN LOCKHEED; 
</P>
<P>
TELLS SEC HIS 9.46% STAKE IS FOR INVESTMENT ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons disclosed Tuesday that he has again increased 
his stake in Lockheed Corp. -- to 9.46% from 8.03%. 
</P>
<P>
The additional purchases, bringing Simmons' holdings to about 6 million common 
shares, renewed questions about the intent of his investment in the 
Calabasas-based aerospace giant. 
</P>
<P>
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tuesday, Simmons referred to 
previous statements that he is buying the stock for long-term investment 
purposes although he may change his mind and seek control. 
</P>
<P>
"I take him at his word that he is an investor," said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an 
analyst with UBS Securities in New York. Simmons' intentions may become clearer 
if he acquires substantially more stock, Demisch added. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts say Simmons, who has raised and lowered his Lockheed stake in 
the past year, realizes that his chances of taking over Lockheed are slim and 
speculate that he may be attempting to force the company to seek a friendly 
buyout by someone else. If that happens, Simmons' investment could dramatically 
increase in value, said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache 
Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
However, Nisbet added, "I don't think he can do that without a much larger 
stake." Moreover, the analyst said, there is little reason for Lockheed's 
management to feel pressured to take any action because of Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they recognize that they've got a lot of power behind them in the U.S. 
government," Nisbet said. Because Lockheed is a prime defense contractor, he 
explained, the Pentagon has an interest in seeing that the company's operations 
are not disrupted and would exert extreme pressure against a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed spokesman said Tuesday that the company had no comment on the 
Simmons filing. Simmons could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Simmons' purchases of Lockheed shares has had the effect of keeping 
their price up, according to analysts. In composite trading Tuesday on the New 
York Stock Exchange, Lockheed stock closed at $48.125, up 12.5 cents. Simmons, 
through two companies he controls -- NL Chemicals and NL Industries -- bought 
909,100 Lockheed shares between July 18 and July 31 for $47.50 to $49 each, for 
a total of about $43.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Valhi Corp., Simmons' major investment vehicle, controls 3.4 million shares -- 
5.49% -- of Lockheed, according to the latest SEC filing. Valhi also controls 
NL Industries, which holds 2.04%, and NL Chemicals, which controls 1.93% of the 
aerospace firm.

Disney Studio Expansion: Heavy crowds and unexpectedly long waiting lines will 
soon force Walt Disney World to double the size of the entertainment portion of 
its new Disney-MGM Studios theme park, company Chairman Michael D. Eisner said. 
Specific plans for the expansion, which would be carried out in three years, 
will be announced in six weeks, Eisner told the Orlando Sentinel. Because many 
of the existing attractions are geared toward adults, the studio expansion 
would add more features for younger children, he said.

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING AT LOWEST LEVEL IN 8 MONTHS 
</P>

<P>
A persistent housing slump helped push construction spending in June to the 
lowest level in eight months, the government said Tuesday, but economists are 
expecting at least a modest rebound as interest rates decline. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government 
construction activity fell 0.8% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$414.7 billion, the lowest level since October. The decline followed a 0.6% 
gain in May and a 0.8% drop in April. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of new housing units dropped 1.2% to an annual rate of $136.6 
billion, the lowest level in three years. It was the fifth consecutive monthly 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
A yearlong campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to fight inflation with higher 
interest rates ended this spring. Starting in early June, the central bank 
reversed course and has eased short-term rates three times, once in June and 
twice last month. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term rates, over which the Fed has less influence, are also down. 
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.81% last week, the lowest in two 
years, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Economists expect rates to continue falling gradually and, as a result, 
construction activity to pick up. But, softness in economic growth overall will 
prevent a strong surge, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a big rebound. . . . At least in the housing sector, I think we 
have several more slow months to come while people wait to see whether we're 
going to have a recession or not," said economist James Christian of the U.S. 
League of Savings Institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't sell them, you shouldn't build them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Activity for the first six months of the year was only 2.9% above the same 
period in 1988, an increase that doesn't even make up for inflation in 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
The weakness in June included a 4.8% drop in public construction, which 
accounts for about one-fifth of construction activity, to an annual rate of 
$80.6 billion. The decline included a 3.6% drop in spending for highways and 
streets, the biggest government category. 
</P>
<P>
Spending on single-family homes fell 1.3% to an annual rate of $113.6 billion, 
while multifamily construction was down 0.9% to $23 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Non-residential construction rose 2.8% to a rate of $100.3 billion. That 
reflected strength in industrial projects, up 4.3%; hotels and motels, up 6.8%; 
office building, up 1.8%, and other commercial projects such as shopping 
centers, up 2.5%.

In another sign of widespread weakness in the economy, the nation's purchasing 
agents said Tuesday that their closely watched index of buying activity fell 
below the critical 50% level in July for the third straight month. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said in its monthly report on 
business that the index, compiled from purchasing executives at more than 250 
industrial companies, fell to 46% from 48.8% in June and 49.7% in May. 
</P>
<P>
A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing segment of the economy is 
expanding, while one below 50% suggests that it is contracting. 
</P>
<P>
The July reading was the lowest since January, 1983, when the index was also 
46%, the association said. It was the third consecutive reading below 50%, 
following 33 consecutive months above that level. 
</P>
<P>
The report comes after a string of recent government reports indicating that 
economic growth in the United States is slowing and may be grinding to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that construction spending fell 0.8% 
in June, a sharper decline than the 0.3% decline that had been expected by 
economists. On Friday, the department said growth in personal spending 
practically came to a halt last month. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the purchasing agents' report was strong in the bond market, which 
took it to mean that a recession was imminent and that interest rates were 
headed lower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar Declines 
</P>
<P>
In the stock market, the report initially had little effect as stocks rose 
modestly. But by the close, the Dow Jones industrial index dropped 19.54 to 
2,641.12, apparently on recession fears bolstered by the report. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell, trading at 1.8570 West German marks after closing Monday 
at 1.86.50. Against the Japanese yen, it was at 136.45, down from 136.92, on 
expectations of lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing agents said their index has averaged 50.6% for the first seven 
months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Past experience indicates that if this average were to continue for the 
balance of 1989, it would be consistent with real (economic) growth of about 
2.1%," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Bretz said the index's average for the past four months, 49.4%, appears to 
be more consistent with real growth in gross national product of about 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The index would have to fall below 44% before indicating a real decline in the 
nation's total output of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
The association said production declined in July, snapping a string of 35 
consecutive months of expansion. The production index slid to 48.3% in July 
from 52.4% the month before. The index last month was at its lowest level since 
July, 1985, when it was 48.2%. 
</P>
<P>
New orders fell for the second consecutive month, following 48 continuous 
months of growth. The new order index fell to 44.8% last month, its lowest 
level since November, 1982, when the economic recovery began. 
</P>
<P>
The group also said prices fell for the second straight month after 34 
consecutive months of increase. The price index slipped to its lowest level 
since April, 1986. Corrugated shipping containers, considered an economic 
bellwether, fell in price after many years of increases. 
</P>
<P>
PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX 
</P>
<P>
The index, based on a survey of 250 purchasing executives, is a composite of 
five separate indicators: new orders, production, vendor deliveries, 
inventories and employment.

INDONESIA CRACKS DOWN ON PIRATED COMPUTER SOFTWARE

Pirated copies of computer software were pulled off store shelves Tuesday as a 
copyright protection agreement took effect between the United States and 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
The price of an edition of Lotus Development Corp. software shot up overnight 
from $1.50 for a bogus copy to $422 for the Cambridge, Mass., manufacturer's 
original version. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the change, last-minute shoppers packed a central Jakarta 
computer store Saturday and Monday, snapping up all pirated software manuals in 
stock at unadvertised discounts, the store manager said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were packed. You could not move in here. The expatriates were more panicked 
than the local people on this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The store was deserted Tuesday. Master copies of pirated software were locked 
away "for our collection," the store manager said. Legitimate versions of 
WordStar 5 and Lotus 1-2-3, third release, were displayed for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Several store managers contacted Tuesday said they had no software for sale, 
only hardware. 
</P>
<P>
"Bigger stores that sell software as a sideline do not want to take the risk," 
one store manager said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether small shops that specialize exclusively in pirated 
software would continue operating somehow. Spokesmen for the police and the 
Attorney General's Office were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent computer dealer suggested that U.S. software producers drop their 
prices to match the spending power of people in developing nations.

20 YEARS LATER, SPAN IS LOVED AND LOATHED

You see it from a distance, and it's like the most beautiful thing you've ever 
seen. It's like this gorgeous woman -- mysterious, alluring, powerful. It gives 
me such a great feeling when I see it on the way back from visiting my mom near 
Long Beach. It makes me feel at home, like I'm part of something special. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phillip Needham, tow truck driver, San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, it was a symbol of devastation. A lot of people feel it 
ruined Barrio Logan. When it first opened, it had a terrible, terrific impact. 
But now it's a piece of living art. It has a melodic effect on my life, my 
vision. It's a strange thing to say, but I love the bridge. -- Salvador Torres, 
artist in Barrio Logan 
</P>
<P>
I think it stinks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Donald P. Murphy, Coronado resident 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, in the same summer as Woodstock and man's walk on the moon, a 
bridge was opened, linking the sleepy peninsula of Coronado with one of the 
country's fastest-growing cities. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would change the nature of two neighborhoods forever. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would alter political fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would serve as an avenue of suicide for the nearly 150 people who 
leaped to their deaths from its tallest point, and as a way to sustain life for 
an endangered species, the peregrine falcon. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would inspire envy, resentment, awe and avarice. This bridge would 
serve as an easel for a new form of urban art. This bridge would end one method 
of transportation and give rise to another. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would, in the summer of peace and love, inspire anything but. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago today, on Aug. 2, 1969, when the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge 
was officially opened, Robert L. Wynn, then city manager of Coronado, remembers 
riding across the majestic span in a 1918 Duesenberg, thinking, "I don't 
believe it -- it's happened!" 
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, Wynn has been city manager of Newport Beach. He has no problem 
recalling the conflict that preceded and followed the building of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was voted on three times in advisory elections and defeated every time," 
Wynn said. "Truth is, the people of Coronado never wanted the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
But Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown did. Wynn said it was the partnership of Brown 
and John Alessio, then owner of the Hotel del Coronado and Brown's wealthiest 
backer, that eventually linked San Diego to Coronado by a method other than 
ferry. 
</P>
<P>
No special ceremony will mark today's anniversary. As Mary Kay Forsyth, 
executive vice president of the Coronado Chamber of Commerce, put it: "A lot of 
factions here still deeply resent the bridge. Some drive to San Diego by way of 
Imperial Beach, just to avoid taking it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admirals Were Reassured 
</P>
<P>
Forsyth, who has lived in Coronado for 40 years, said opposition to the bridge 
crumbled when the Navy gave in. 
</P>
<P>
"For years the Navy was afraid of war, afraid that a bridge would bottle up the 
entire fleet in the South Bay," she said. "When the admirals were finally 
assured that a bridge could be built high enough to prevent that from 
happening, they said OK." 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the state considered a two-lane truss bridge in the early 
part of the century, an idea the Navy scuttled. In 1929, the San Francisco 
Bridge &amp; Tunnel Co. launched a proposal to build a bridge and commissioned 
a feasibility study -- but the stock market crash killed that idea. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, the Coronado City Council proposed building a four-lane bridge with 
6-foot walkways on either side. Again, the Navy reared its head, saying, in the 
words of one official, "Collapsed bridges sink ships." More measures came and 
went before pro-bridge forces proved unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Brown dubbed the bridge "my baby," a catch phrase he said he invoked "to 
anger the editors of the San Diego Union. They were always so mean to me. And 
they never wanted the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the bridge got built only because he and the three other members of 
the Toll Bridge Authority decided they would build it. Once bonds were sold, it 
was, in Brown's words, "a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
Now a Los Angeles lawyer, Brown called the Coronado Bridge "one of the great 
accomplishments of my tenure as governor. I realized I could facilitate 
thousands of people reaching the peninsula of Coronado, one of the loveliest 
bodies of land in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was and is," he said, "a provincial place. A lot of retired Navy people 
didn't want (the bridge) then and will tell you they don't want it now. The 
growth of the area superseded their wishes. That's the reason I wanted it built 
-- I could foresee the growth of California and particularly of San Diego 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his alliance with Alessio had "nothing to do with the bridge being 
built. He was and is a friend of mine. I wanted the bridge because it had to be 
built. Can you imagine Coronado now without the bridge? It's absurd to even 
try." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is 2.23 miles long. The design incorporating its 27 girders -- once 
likened to flamingo legs joined by a strand -- is orthotropic, meaning the 
structural support units also form the road surface, keeping weight and costs 
down. Because the configuration provides support in different directions, the 
bridge is able to support staggering loads -- and to withstand ships striking 
the girders. 
</P>
<P>
That's happened once, said Tom Nipper, a spokesman for the California 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A commercial shipping boat "knocked some of the timbers off but did no damage 
to the concrete pilings," he said. "There's never been substantial damage to 
the bridge. The bridge was built at a height (246 feet) where even the tallest 
aircraft carriers can pass underneath it. There's no way anything can strike 
the top." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge was built without lights. The designers felt those would be 
aesthetically unappealing. A series of head-on traffic accidents changed their 
minds about that, and now many credit lights as the reason for its nickname, 
"the Jewel." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge cost $48 million and was financed through the sale of construction 
bonds. Work began in February, 1967, and the bridge opened 2 1/2 years later. 
The bill was paid off in 1986, 17 years ahead of schedule. The west-bound only 
toll was $1.20 until last year, when it was reduced to $1. Officials for 
Caltrans, which owns and operates the bridge, say they don't know when, or if, 
the toll will be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the lingering controversies surrounding the bridge is its lack of a 
thoroughfare for bicyclists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge is a state highway," California 75, Nipper noted. "It's too 
dangerous for bicyclists and pedestrians." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his only regret about the bridge is that it ignores bicyclists and 
walkers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a mistake," he said. "One of the sweetest sights in the world is the 
hundreds of walkers and bicyclists who use the Golden Gate Bridge. I wish 
something could be done. . . . That would make the bridge just about perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Donald P. Murphy, 63, who was born in Coronado and moved back in 1968 after 25 
years in the Army, said scores of retirees resent the bridge, and thought they 
had given up conflict when the wars were over. Now, he says, they're locked in 
another battle -- developers versus residents, cars versus people. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a prisoner in my own home," said Murphy, who lives three blocks from 
the bridge at 4th and C streets, which, depending on the time, can become 
gridlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said traffic in Coronado is almost intolerable. In a few years, he said, 
the town will be reduced to "total chaos, and then the Navy will have to do 
something, because none of its personnel will be able to reach North Island due 
to the volume of traffic coming off the bridge. Until that happens, we'll all 
have to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Larson, a Caltrans spokesman, said 50,000 cars a day cross the bridge and 
half that many enter through Imperial Beach the Silver Strand. The city of 
Coronado claims a population of 23,603. Officials at North Island say they 
employ between 8,000 and 9,000 civilians and 4,200 Navy personnel. Tourism is a 
no-holds-barred industry. The bridge recorded a 6.3% increase in traffic last 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Toll bridge Lt. R. D. Thomas said the bridge averaged 15,000 cars a day when it 
opened. The total number of vehicles crossing the bridge in all of 1970 was 7.8 
million, he said, but the annual number now is close to 25 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increases Every Year 
</P>
<P>
He said the bridge is likely to record a peak of 72,000 cars a day this summer 
(it saw 69,000 on Monday alone), and about 55,000 a day on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Toll bridge Capt. Dennis Poirier said the bridge has averaged a 6% to 10% 
increase in traffic every year since it opened. Part of the revenue collected 
at the toll booth is used to commission studies on Coronado's traffic, he said, 
and the rest is allocated for maintenance and road repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's a bad problem," Poirier said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor R. H. Dorman favored a tunnel that would transport cars from the 
toll plaza to a gateway near the naval base. It was defeated, and Dorman's 
fortunes sank with it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Mary Herron, who ousted Dorman in last year's election, said the tunnel 
would have cost more than $100 million; a road around the perimeter of 
Coronado, which some favor, would cost three times that amount. She has 
proposed what she calls "the $28-million solution" to the traffic imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
Herron's plan is being evaluated by the California Transportation Commission, 
which hopes to reach a decision on it by next month. Herron predicts that a 
sophisticated system of new bus lines and signal lights will alleviate the 
crunch, but some people are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"The buses we have now operate at less than 20% capacity," said resident 
Murphy. "I'd say the best idea is to move." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is not without grisly traffic accidents or suicides. Mary Ann 
Tamburello, clerical supervisor for the San Diego County coroner, said 145 
people have killed themselves by leaping from the bridge. Most were men in 
their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Three signs in each direction now offer would-be victims the phone number of a 
suicide hot line. Two signs are near the center of the bridge, where the span 
reaches its greatest height from the water. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Needham, 51, works as a tow truck driver for Caltrans. He said he has 
tried to stop 48 people from jumping and credits himself, like a proud relief 
pitcher, with 25 "saves." 
</P>
<P>
"They're up there, they're confused, somebody doesn't love 'em or they've just 
given up," he said. "What do I say? Each one is different. Sometimes I'm nice. 
Sometimes I'm firm. I try to snap them out of their mood, whatever that is. And 
when I don't succeed . . . it's just a horrible thing to witness." 
</P>
<P>
Four peregrine falcons have, at various times, nested under the bridge, above 
Salvador Torres' murals in Chicano Park. Jim Larson of Caltrans believes the 
birds picked the bridge because it's isolated, and they can feed on the pigeons 
beneath its arches. 
</P>
<P>
Peregrine falcons are an endangered species. For a long time after the bridge 
was built, Torres said the neighborhood nearby was endangered, too. Like the 
falcons, it learned to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
The communities most affected by the bridge -- Coronado and Barrio Logan -- are 
alarmingly different, a graphic illustration of America as a land of haves and 
have-nots. The burden each shares is having been irrevocably altered by the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
A cluster of chichi shops greets visitors off the new passenger ferry, which 
first docked in Coronado in 1987. Peohe's, the restaurant nearest the landing, 
offers lobster for $34.95. Just a few miles away in the barrio, Cuatro Milpas 
sells five rolled tacos for $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the streets in the barrio are dark and mean, and a few people have 
spent years trying to undo the damage inflicted by the bridge and Interstate 5, 
which cut a swath through the neighborhood a few years before. 
</P>
<P>
Rachael Ortiz, executive director of Barrio Station, a social-service agency, 
said the worst aspect of the bridge was the neighborhood being converted to 
"mixed use and seedy light industry," not to mention the havoc wreaked on homes 
and families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Split the Community 
</P>
<P>
After the bridge was built, "dozens of these creepy businesses moved in," she 
said. "There were shipbuilding shops, welders, sandblasters. . . . The 
employees, and there were hundreds of 'em, parked wherever they could, even if 
it meant your front yard. Children were crossing streets in front of giant 
trucks, and right over our heads was this great big bridge, casting its shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, it split the community, and we were enraged. The area was 
raped by anyone wanting to make money. Overnight, we became their whores -- the 
junkyard empire of San Diego. But now, slowly, it's changing. We've targeted 23 
junkyards, and, except for one, all have adopted enclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody cared about building a bridge over us -- in the beginning, we didn't 
matter -- but we made them care. The lesson is, one person's treasure can be 
another's demise." 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Al Ducheny said the opening of the freeway severed the 
barrio from Logan Heights, and the bridge bisected the barrio, "completing the 
devastation." The neighborhood's takeover of what became Chicano Park and the 
murals that followed "turned a bad thing into a good thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the survivors in Barrio Logan speak of their concrete ceiling in tones far 
more loving than those muttered in Coronado. Torres, the artist, is one of 
those who views the bridge with a feeling approaching reverence. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look into the depth of the columns, as the arches flow toward the 
waterfront, I hear a sound, a mystical sound, like that of a living creature," 
he said. "To me, the bridge is life -- reassurance, reaffirmation . . . love. I 
know what the birds must feel when they fly over. They feel pride, in a 
fortress of beauty and strength."

FOUNTAIN VALLEY GROUP TRIES TO RAISE $28,000 FOR SALARY; 
</P>
<P>
PARENTS BATTLE TO KEEP A 'GOOD' TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual effort to save the job of a popular high school music teacher, a 
group of Fountain Valley parents is rushing to raise $28,000 to pay his salary 
and keep his music program alive at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and students have staged a sing-a-thon at a pizza parlor, persuaded a 
yogurt shop to pitch in part of its profits and solicited donations outside 
supermarkets in the effort to keep Ted Reid, 34, teaching at Fountain Valley 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, widely praised for his ability to inspire students to excel and embrace 
the love of music, has taught at the school for the last three years but was 
among 32 teachers who were told that they would not be rehired for the fall 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a steadily declining enrollment in the Huntington Beach Union High 
School District, officials said, there will be 2,200 fewer students in the 
district's six high schools this fall, compared to figures two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But parents, who rave about Reid's program and how it has turned their children 
on to music and the arts, have vowed to raise enough money to retain him as the 
music teacher and director of the school's three choirs. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of teacher who can pass on his enthusiasm and knowledge of music is 
rare," said Pat Harney, whose three children have studied under Reid. "A lot of 
artists aren't necessarily good teachers. They can't convey their feelings and 
their expertise to kids. But Ted Reid is really good at that. He turns the kids 
on to music." 
</P>
<P>
While parent groups in Huntington Beach and other districts have raised money 
to supplement teacher salaries or augment special programs, directors of other 
education groups in Irvine and Huntington Beach say it is rare for a group to 
take on the task of raising money to save one teacher's job. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the group formed to keep Reid on the payroll -- the Vocal Music 
Foundation with about 100 parent members -- was prepared to raise $43,000 to 
pay Reid's full-time salary, his compensation for teaching three periods of 
music and two English classes. In addition, the school district had told the 
group that in order to put Reid on the fall schedule, it would have to come up 
with the entire amount by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But after hearing of the parents' determination and of the difficulties the 
group was having in raising the money, the district said it would require only 
$28,000, or enough to pay Reid for the three periods of music. The district 
said it needed only a portion of the total amount -- $12,000 -- by Aug. 15, 
with the rest due later. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to other fund-raising activities, the group also appealed to real 
estate agencies in the Huntington Beach area for help, saying that if a school 
doesn't have a good music program, home sales could drop. 
</P>
<P>
All this attention, frankly, makes Reid a little uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gratifying and a little bit flattering," he said. "It's also a little bit 
uncomfortable to have people spending so much of their free time and free 
energy on your behalf. But I know ultimately that it's on behalf of their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Parents say special programs such as Reid's choirs make the school a special 
place for students. But they say that in these times of scarce school funds, 
such programs are fast becoming luxuries that parents are having to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Music Programs Fading 
</P>
<P>
"Fountain Valley doesn't have any music in its elementary schools anymore," 
said Susan Pike, the mother of two students in the music program. "I feel like 
a lot of people don't realize what's happening. By the time they get to high 
school, a lot of programs that we have known in years past will not be around 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Einstein, a former Reid student who will become a music major at Ithaca 
College in New York this fall, praised Reid for his commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot speak highly enough about this program," she said. "The best part of 
my high school experience was the choir." 
</P>
<P>
The school has three choirs; each puts on several performances a year and the 
groups also appear in some out-of-town concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes hours and hours of rehearsal and planning the tours and planning 
different performances," Einstein said. "Mr. Reid happens to be the type of 
teacher who puts his entire person into it." 
</P>
<P>
Parents and students say that Reid has become more than just a teacher. Because 
the choirs, like many other extracurricular activities, take up so much of 
Reid's time, he has become a friend, mentor and role model for their children. 
He, in turn, said that the music program at Fountain Valley was successful 
because of parent support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indicative of Quality Students 
</P>
<P>
"Their support is indicative of quality of students we have," Reid said. "The 
support we get from parents makes it possible for us to reach higher and higher 
and higher goals." 
</P>
<P>
Reid said there have been a few other jobs he has heard about that he might 
qualify for, but "some of the jobs I heard about, I wasn't interested in. 
Fountain Valley has a wonderful program. The job conditions are really 
excellent. Once you've been in that situation, it's harder to take any old job 
just to have a job." 
</P>
<P>
Married and the father of a 2-month-old child, Reid said the uncertainty over 
his future had been "a point of tremendous concern for my wife and me. We are 
renters, and we wanted to buy a home." 
</P>
<P>
Because he did not know his status with the Huntington Beach school district, 
he has found two other part-time jobs: one directing a 100-voice adult choir 
called the Masterworks Chorale at Orange Coast College and the other a 
part-time job as music director at a Huntington Beach church. 
</P>
<P>
The district was not going to do away with the music program entirely at 
Fountain Valley High. But administrators were going to ask a music teacher at 
another school to take on the programs at both schools. 
</P>
<P>
That will kill the quality of the program, parents and students contend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compares It to Coach 
</P>
<P>
"That is comparable to asking a football coach to take over at two schools," 
Reid said. "(The other teacher) has a big program, and I have a big program." 
</P>
<P>
"It's do-able, but both programs are going to suffer," he said. "It has nothing 
to do with his ability but with the nature of the job." 
</P>
<P>
Reid's story illustrates how one school district's financial crisis affects the 
lives of students, teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Union's enrollment has been on the decline for several years, 
choking off school revenues. For every student lost, the district must give up 
$3,219 in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the district has been hiring teachers on one-year 
temporary contracts as the number of students has declined. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't give permanent contracts anymore (at Huntington Beach)," said 
Jim Harlan, executive director of West Orange County United Teachers, which 
represents five school districts. "They hire everyone as temporaries." 
</P>
<P>
In December, the district announced that it would not lay off tenured teachers 
even if it was over-staffed. Instead, it would place "surplus" tenured teachers 
into a substitute pool and would use them on an as-needed basis but would 
continue paying them a full-time salary. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers on year-to-year contracts like Reid, however, would be laid off, it 
was decided. 
</P>
<P>
So far, many of those in the substitute pool have found jobs with other 
districts, according to Assistant Supt. Susan Roper, who is in charge of 
teacher hiring. Others were absorbed into the regular schedule because of 
attrition and retirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question System 
</P>
<P>
Some of Reid's students and their parents suggest that there is something wrong 
with a system that puts more weight on a teacher's longevity than on his or her 
teaching qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of sad," said student Joel Williams, who graduated last year. "The 
system that we have in California today doesn't recognize good teachers versus 
bad teachers. It just recognizes seniority. You have teachers that have been in 
the district a long time and have seniority, but they don't have the good ideas 
of a new teacher just coming out of college. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying every new teacher is better than every old teacher," he said. 
"But there are some teachers whose time is just up."

U.S. FOCUSING HOSTAGE EFFORTS ON IRAN, SYRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration worked delicately Tuesday to encourage third-party 
negotiations seeking the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, while trying to 
reduce pressure at home for a quick response to the apparent murder of Marine 
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's "preferred outcome," as one senior counterterrorism 
official put it, is an exchange of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel, including 
a militant Shiite Muslim clergyman seized last week, for Israeli and American 
captives held by Lebanese radicals. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, U.S. efforts are concentrated on Iran and Syria, 
with diplomats trying to open channels of communications with Tehran and 
pushing Damascus to intervene with radical Islamic groups in regions of Lebanon 
it controls. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran and Syria are the two countries there that would have the most impact on 
the situation, so it is natural that our diplomatic efforts are centered 
largely on those two countries," a State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's obviously some kind of disagreement in Iran about what has happened," 
the official added, noting that Iran's foreign minister had condemned the 
Higgins killing while the interior minister appeared to condone it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Iran, 
American diplomats have passed messages to that nation's new government through 
numerous channels, including the government of Syria as well as the embassies 
of Japan, West Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Administration is hopeful that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze may have been able to elicit Iranian help during meetings in 
Tehran on Tuesday. Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Shevardnadze 
in Paris on Monday, after the Shiite group had threatened to hang Higgins but 
before a videotape of the purported act was released, and discussed the hostage 
issue with him, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, repeated efforts to enlist Iranian and Syrian help in 
freeing hostages have proven futile. And so far "we have not had a single 
positive signal," a State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials repeatedly insist that the one group they have not sought to 
talk with directly is the captors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy has been very clear that we do not negotiate for the release of 
hostages," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. But what U.S. officials 
are unable to do directly might be accomplished indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is a sovereign nation," Fitzwater noted. "They have a different policy 
with regard to hostages than we have." In the past, Israel has been able to 
engineer hostage exchanges that have freed U.S. captives while avoiding direct 
U.S. negotiations with hostage takers. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli officials proposed swapping U.S. and Israeli hostages for 
Shiite detainees in Israeli prisons and Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Lebanese 
Shiite clergyman and radical leader seized by Israeli troops in Lebanon last 
week. Prospects for such a swap dimmed when it was rejected by Lebanon's 
fundamentalist Hezbollah organization. 
</P>
<P>
If that deal could be brought about, it could lead to freedom for some or all 
of the remaining U.S. hostages in Lebanon. If it does not succeed, however, 
"the options are not good in a situation like this," a senior U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. hopes riding on Israeli success in negotiating some sort of swap, 
both the White House and the State Department moved quickly to repair any rift 
between the two nations stemming from Obeid's kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several days, several members of Congress, including Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), had expressed irritation with Israel, saying 
that seizing Obeid had endangered American lives. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about those criticisms, Fitzwater repeatedly emphasized the close nature 
of U.S.-Israeli ties. Israel, he said, is "a strong ally," and the two nations 
have a "vibrant relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Congress, including Orange County Reps. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton) and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), called on the President to 
stage a military strike against the terrorists -- if they can be located. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is whether we can establish who is responsible and where they are," 
Dannemeyer said. He said another alternative would be to rally European leaders 
behind the United States to collectively deny commercial airline landings at 
countries where terrorists are believed operating. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said Bush should warn the terrorists that "the next hostage they kill, 
we will act as if they've killed all eight. We cannot let them kill them one at 
a time." 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent a good part of the day meeting with key advisers to assess the 
situation, conducting one 90-minute session with Baker, Vice President Dan 
Quayle, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Deputy National 
Security Adviser Robert M. Gates, CIA Director William H. Webster, Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Adm. William J. 
Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Bush telephoned Pope John Paul II to ask for help in getting 
Higgins' body returned, although White House aides cautioned that the 
government is still not entirely sure Higgins is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Such doubts underscored the tremendous uncertainty facing Administration 
policy-makers. The Administration cannot say for sure when Higgins was killed 
-- assuming that he is dead -- who killed him, where he had been held or where 
the remaining hostages are being held. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. forensic experts, who have obtained a copy of the videotape that purports 
to show Higgins' hanging, are examining the tape in an attempt to find clues 
that would indicate whether the victim was already dead when it was made and 
whether it is Higgins, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As conflicting reports poured into Washington, White House aides sought to 
coordinate information from the Situation Room in the White House basement. At 
the State Department, officials reactivated a special hostage task force, 
placing its members in a room down the corridor from the seventh-floor office 
of the secretary of state. The atmosphere, a task force official said, was 
"bedlam." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's extensive involvement in monitoring the Lebanese crisis, aides 
took pains to insist that he was not preoccupied with it. The situation at the 
White House was "not business as usual," said spokesman Fitzwater. But, he 
added, "we're still conducting the day's business here." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to fall into the Carter trap," said a senior White House 
official, referring to then-President Jimmy Carter's high-profile preoccupation 
with U.S. hostages in Iran during 1980. "You paralyze your own government and 
the hostage takers get some of what they want, which is the preoccupation of 
the world's pre-eminent power. . . . It's important to deprive them of that." 
</P>
<P>
Bush pointedly stuck to his plans to host a White House barbecue for members of 
Congress on Tuesday evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
One man was seriously injured and another was charged with drunk driving as the 
result of the crash early Tuesday of their four-wheel drive vehicle into a 
large construction dumpster beside Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Henson, 28, of Arcata, was trapped in the 2 a.m. wreck, and emergency crews 
had to use a hydraulic prying device to free him, said Newport Beach police 
spokesman Robert Oakley. Henson was taken by helicopter to United Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he underwent surgery Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle, James Andrew Svetz, 25, of Newport Beach, was 
charged with drunk driving and was released on his own recognizance, Oakley 
said.

ORANGE COAST COLLEGE PRESIDENT RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Coast College President Donald R. Bronsard resigned his post in a letter 
to district board members Tuesday, and requested a one-year leave of absence 
"to break out of the bureaucracy" and test his entrepreneurial skills. 
</P>
<P>
Bronsard, 50, was named president in 1985. He is credited with reversing a 
decline and building enrollment to 26,419 students, making the Costa Mesa 
college the largest single-campus community college in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Community College District trustees accepted Bronsard's resignation 
Tuesday night, and are expected to consider an interim replacement at the Aug. 
16 board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Bronsard said Tuesday that the unpaid leave, begining Aug. 11, will allow him 
to investigate business opportunities with little risk, since he will return to 
a teaching post in language arts and literature at one of three colleges in the 
district. He said he has no specific plans and will look into his own business 
or a partnership in educational consulting, manufacturing, retail or research. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a mild heart attack last summer, and that reminds one of one's 
mortality," Bronsard said. "You don't have all the time in the world to do what 
you want to do, so you better do it. I'm recovered fully and very healthy, so I 
decided now's the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point is to establish a beachhead in the entrepreneurial economy of 
the area and then manage it while I teach." 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Orange Coast, Bronsard was vice president and academic dean at 
Concord College, a four-year college in Athens, W. Va. His 20-year career in 
education includes seven years in teaching and 13 years in administration.

FIREFIGHTERS RETREAT IN FAKE BOMB SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters mopping up after a blaze in an apartment made a hasty exit Tuesday 
evening when they sighted what appeared to be a bomb resting on a coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
A police bomb squad was called to the scene in the 200 block of 17th Street to 
detonate the device, which turned out to be a fake that neighbors had said the 
owner kept around as a joke, according to authorities. Nonetheless, it caused a 
few anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
"The fireman was on the nozzle in front of me, and he tried to climb right 
through me" after sighting the phony bomb, Fire Capt. Mick Terich said. The 
device, he said, resembled six road flares wrapped in wires and a timing 
device. 
</P>
<P>
In another twist, a hysterical woman burst past fire lines in the apparent 
mistaken belief that her own apartment was ablaze, officials said. Tackled by 
several firefighters, she bit one on the hand so severely that he was taken for 
treatment at a local hospital. The unidentified woman was released when the 
firefighter declined to press criminal charges, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated $165,000 damage, and its cause remains under 
investigation.

KRAFT'S NIECE BREAKS DOWN, UNABLE TO FINISH PLEA FOR HER UNCLE'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A niece of Randy Steven Kraft had to leave the witness stand Tuesday after 
breaking into tears when she asked jurors to spare her uncle's life. 
</P>
<P>
Mindy Lane was helped from the courtroom by her mother, Doris Lane, Kraft's 
sister. The young woman was so upset she reportedly refused to return to the 
courtroom, even though she had not yet been cross-examined by the prosecutor in 
the death penalty hearing. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day of contrasts for jurors. They also heard Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan 
F. Brown express incredulity to a minister on the witness stand that Kraft has 
never shown remorse for the 24 murder victims included in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, a Long Beach computer consultant, was convicted at his Santa Ana 
trial in May of 16 murders of young men in Orange County. Though prosecutors 
have linked him to 45 murders in all, they have added only eight to the penalty 
phase of his trial in Superior Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ignatio Castuera of the Hollywood United Methodist Church was the 
fourth minister during the penalty phase to ask jurors to spare Kraft's life. 
He said he had come to like Kraft so much that it reinforced his own view that 
the death of anyone in the gas chamber "diminishes us all." 
</P>
<P>
Brown asked if the minister had talked to Kraft about the 24 victims. Only in 
passing, the minister said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown moved closer to the witness stand and asked: "Help us out here, sir. Did 
Mr. Kraft show any remorse whatsoever for these kids?" 
</P>
<P>
The minister answered that Kraft had not really had an opportunity to show 
remorse in their conversations because they talked about religion and 
philosophy, not about killings. 
</P>
<P>
"So I would guess the answer would be he didn't show any remorse," Brown said, 
bringing a storm of protest from Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the witnesses Tuesday were sheriff's deputies or deputy marshals who 
have been around Kraft since his arrival at the Orange County Jail six years 
ago. They all said he had not been a problem for them. One deputy marshal said 
he even went to Kraft when he was having a problem on a program in a computer 
class he was taking. Kraft solved the problem in five seconds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the most dramatic moment of the day came when Lane told the court that she 
couldn't continue as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Lane had testified at the Kraft trial previously, during the guilt phase. It 
was Lane who had gone with Kraft to pick up a birthday cake for his father for 
a large family gathering the same weekend prosecutors say he killed two young 
Buena Park men. Kraft's attorneys tried to show jurors through Lane's testimony 
that he was carrying on routine family activities that weekend and showed no 
signs that anything was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Lane's task was different Tuesday. Kraft lawyer McDonald asked her to speak 
directly to jurors and tell them why Kraft should be given a sentence of life 
without parole instead of death, the jury's only two choices. 
</P>
<P>
Lane told them how good Kraft had always been to her. 
</P>
<P>
"He could be very good for helping other people, and I think you should look 
into that very deeply and strongly, because . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Lane then began to choke on tears as she tried to add, "I don't think that 
should go to waste." 
</P>
<P>
When it was clear she would not be able to return, prosecutor Brown said he did 
not need to cross-examine her. 
</P>
<P>
Today is scheduled to be the final day of defense testimony in the Kraft trial, 
which began with jury selection slightly over a year ago. McDonald told the 
court that he also might have to use Thursday morning for his last witness. 
Brown is expected to complete his rebuttal by Friday.

DONATIONS WILL PAY FOR BOY'S FUNERAL COSTS.; 
</P>
<P>
HELP FOR A BEREAVED FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Enough donations have been received by the bereaved family of Omar Jimenez, an 
8-year-old Santa Ana boy who died tragically trying to enter his home through a 
window, to pay for the $3,000 in funeral expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to thank the people who contributed. We want to tell them we love 
them," Omar's mother, Maria Elena Jimenez, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Omar died last Wednesday in a freak accident when he was crushed by a falling 
window at the couple's Santa Ana home. A latchkey child who attended year-round 
school, he came home from school but forgot his key. He was trying to crawl 
through the window when it fell on him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
More than $1,000 in cash was contributed from Jimenez's friends and co-workers 
at TDK Electronics in Irvine after she told them they did not have the money to 
pay for her son's burial costs. The rest of the contributions came from other 
people, including Times readers, who pitched in to help pay for funeral and 
burial costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Que grande personas, (what great people) que grande," declared a relieved 
Roberto Escalante, who has fathered Jimenez's two other children. "With this 
amount, we now have enough to pay the mortuary." 
</P>
<P>
Donations, some with kind sentiments written on them, accompanied checks of 
$20, $30 and one for $200, written to Escalante on behalf of Omar. 
</P>
<P>
Many contributors were emotionally struck by the tragedy that befell the 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
One Irvine family wrote that after reading about the tragedy, the father asked 
each family member, "How would you like to help another human being?" 
</P>
<P>
The letter then said: "Enclosed please find $40 from Dianne and myself, $10 
each from our working teen-age daughters, Wendy and Heidi, and $2 from our 
youngest child, Tamme." It was signed Ron Eroh. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez, whose son was buried Saturday in Orange County, said the act of 
kindness from strangers had been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, please tell whoever helped us, 'Thank you,' " she said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of the boy's death has prompted the couple to look for a new home. 
They have two other children, Mayra, 3, and Hector, 3 months. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Brown, owner of Brown Colonial Mortuary in Santa Ana, had offered the 
family two alternatives. They could have the boy buried in the United States 
for about $3,000 or have him transported to Mexico, where Jimenez's family 
lives, for half that cost. 
</P>
<P>
"After the story appeared in the newspaper, we ended up having to turn away 
people. The response was really amazing," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the family and investigators continue to piece together how the 
accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante said he and Jimenez have examined the window repeatedly. It is an 
older, heavy double-hung window about 29 inches wide. Usually, it would be 
stuck most of the time, so family members would prop it open with a wooden 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a man's strength to open it. Maria couldn't do it by herself," 
Escalante said. "It was a heavy window. We think Omar jumped up about 18 inches 
and somehow managed to open it but couldn't keep it open, and it slammed down 
on him." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman from the coroner's office agreed with Escalante's scenario and 
added that as the boy climbed up and in, his body movement could have caused 
the window to come down. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried the window several times, and it was tough to get open. You really 
had to push to get it open. It would stick once it was open, but with a little 
jiggle, it would come slamming down," said Cherry Van Stee, a senior deputy 
coroner. 
</P>
<P>
With a window ledge 47 inches from the ground, and since the boy stood 53 
inches, "he would have had to have jumped up there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office will conduct more tests before the death certificate is 
signed with the exact cause, she said. Based on a preliminary autopsy, the boy 
died of asphyxiation due to compression of the chest, she said.

ANAHEIM VOTES OPPOSITION TO TOUGH AQMD REGIONAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim on Tuesday became the first city in Orange County to oppose a stringent 
regional plan for air quality management now under consideration by state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, voting 5 to 0, approved a resolution protesting the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District plan because it amounts to "usurpation of 
local control," said Kristine Thalman, Anaheim's intergovernmental relations 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD plan is intended to reduce pollution in a region that is among the 
worst in the country and includes Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. Both the public and private sectors must take steps to 
comply with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
For Anaheim, where the cost of compliance is expected to be from $2 million to 
$3 million, one of the most expensive changes will be converting the fuel used 
by city-owned vehicles from gasoline to methanol, Thalman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Methanol Safety Questioned 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even sure if that's safe for the environment,"' Thalman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things where we've got to do something, but we're not sure 
if the strategies listed in the plan will actually benefit our city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Miriam Kaywood added, "We all want clean air, but we can't be 
bankrupting the city in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's opposition vote is only a statement of protest; the city has no 
authority to affect the air quality plan, which has been approved by the AQMD 
and is now in the hands of the state Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Council Opposed 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Keith, a spokeswoman for the AQMD, said the only other city council in 
Southern California to oppose the plan was that of Westlake Village in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"It does matter to us" that Anaheim opposes the plan, Keith said, adding, 
"cities have their local concerns." 
</P>
<P>
But she noted that the AQMD solicited comments on the plan for about two years 
before forwarding the document to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Thalman said Anaheim representatives objected to the plan during hearings 
before the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
An AQMD representative at Tuesday night's meeting told the council that the 
agency wants to cooperate with the city and will hold a workshop in the next 
few months to address the concerns of local government officials.

AFTER BATTLE WITH ALCOHOLISM, ORIGINAL ANGEL ELI GRBA GETS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eli Grba fidgets with the ring on his finger. That same finger, at times, has 
been occupied by wedding bands -- three of them. 
</P>
<P>
In their place is a cherished memory. He earned the ring as a member of the 
1960 New York Yankees and on it reads, "1960 American League Champions." 
</P>
<P>
Although he spent only two years pitching with the Yankees, Grba talks with 
pride about playing with Mickey, Whitey and Yogi. He also speaks in glowing 
terms about becoming the first Angel, the team's No. 1 selection in the 1960 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
"They can never take that away from me," he says. "Think about it. The (pause) 
first (pause) person (pause) selected. It was quite an honor." 
</P>
<P>
Honor is also something Grba says he has retrieved after years of fighting 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
As he talks, a gold chain dangles from his neck. On it reads, "365 Happy Days." 
</P>
<P>
It's not exactly a cherished memory. It's a matter of perception. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, Eli Grba has been sober for eight years. That might be Grba's 
best stat. 
</P>
<P>
"I had five DUIs (driving under the influence), six alcoholic seizures and 
numerous fights in bars," he says. "I was in the hospital four different times 
and once they had to pump a pint of blood into me. Never once, in all those 
years, did I think I had a problem. I had a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Grba, 54, is in Riverside with the Reno Silver Sox, a Class-A independent team 
that he manages. It's his first attempt at managing after seven years as a 
minor league coach. 
</P>
<P>
The previous night against the Riverside Red Wave, there was a fight that 
resulted in a broken nose for one of the Reno players. 
</P>
<P>
It took more than 20 minutes to restore order and four players were ejected. 
Yet Grba believes there will be no more trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"It was blown way out of proportion," he says. "These are young kids, they're 
emotional. It's forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Grba that "would knock a batter down if he had to," according 
to former Angel teammate, Lee Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
The same man who was called the "Serbian Strongman," a nickname that was only 
in part for his 6-foot-2, 205-pound menacing appearance on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
But this is also a different Grba. The one with 2,921 happy days behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcoholics are the most cunning . . . you'll ever meet," Grba said. "We can 
get drinks out of people without them even knowing it. We're very cunning." 
</P>
<P>
It took Grba almost 20 years to realize he fit that description. 
</P>
<P>
Grba was released by the Angels in 1963 and washed up as a player in 1967 after 
three failed comeback attempts. His career was over, but the excessive 
drinking, which began as a minor league player during the 1950s, continued. 
</P>
<P>
Grba spent the next 14 years working in odd jobs, shuttling between Southern 
California and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, the only baseball team that employed him was the Oakland 
Athletics. Grba worked as a scout from 1969-71 before being fired. 
</P>
<P>
His drinking steadily increased to the point where he was spending more time in 
bars than at home. His first wife, Bonnie, left him in 1970, taking their two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"The drinking was getting worse and worse," he said. "My wife couldn't take it 
and I don't blame her. It was slowly and surely downhill from then on. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal of an alcoholic is death. And it's a horrible death." 
</P>
<P>
Grba was on that path. 
</P>
<P>
His health was deteriorating rapidly during the mid-1970s. He began having 
alcohol-related seizures and one time had to be hospitalized for internal 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
After a second marriage failed, Grba returned to Chicago. He stayed there for 
two years, finding jobs in factories, then returned to California in 1979 for 
yet another fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back here and immediately got arrested for drunk driving," Grba said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Grba didn't see that he had a problem. But his friends did. 
</P>
<P>
Former Angel and longtime friend Ken Hunt owned a bar in Westchester, a place 
Grba frequented when in California. Although they had been close through the 
years and even rented a house together in 1961, Hunt wanted nothing more to do 
with Grba. 
</P>
<P>
"He would come down and more or less embarrass himself, which was embarrassing 
to me," Hunt said. "People knew who he was and they knew he was my friend. He 
was out of control. I finally had enough." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt and Grba had a fight, after which Grba stopped coming to the bar. 
</P>
<P>
He moved in with a friend who lived in Temple City. The friend also had a 
drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement lasted two months before his friend's wife kicked Grba out of 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me she could treat only one alcoholic in that house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Grba slept in his car. He awoke early the next morning, needing a 
drink. He wandered into a bar at 6 a.m. with $90 in his wallet, which at the 
time was his life savings. 
</P>
<P>
"I put that money on the bar and started drinking," he said. "I had five beers, 
but beer didn't taste good to me anymore. It didn't get me high quick enough." 
</P>
<P>
Grba switched to hard liquor. He also bought some rounds for the few people who 
were in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked down and there was only $40 left," he said. "I thought, this is 
getting to be a $200-a-day habit.' I got up and walked down the street to a 
detox center and checked in. They took a blood sample and my alcohol content 
was two-point-something and it wasn't even 9 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
It would have been a perfect movie ending if Grba stopped drinking at that 
moment. But this was El Monte, not Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Grba also needed a place to stay and felt the Wayne Fanning Alcohol Education 
Center was as good a place as any. 
</P>
<P>
Grba continued to drink on the side. He worked during the day and slipped out 
at night to go to bars. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a pretty stiff house, but it wasn't unusual for someone to sneak out at 
night," said Jim Goodwin, who was the center's executive director. "I had a 
pretty good idea Eli was drinking, but I saw something in him. He had a lot of 
humility and seemed to really want sobriety. You make allowances for people 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Rock bottom came on July 31, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
As was his habit after a night of drinking, Grba slipped into his room through 
a window. Only this time, his foot got caught and he fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I just started laughing," Grba said. "I said, 'God, it's time. Take me now, I 
ain't worth nothing to anybody.' 
</P>
<P>
"I had contemplated suicide before, but the thing that always stopped me was I 
didn't have enough guts to do it. That night, I really didn't want to live 
anymore. All of a sudden, I started to sob and couldn't stop. Then a feeling 
came over me, something I can't describe. . . . It was the first good night 
sleep I'd had in many moons." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Grba met with Goodwin's assistant, Brownie Bellmeaur. She 
told him they knew about his drinking, but, to his surprise, she didn't kick 
him out of the center. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bellmeaur offered him a job on the night desk, where he would help 
check people into the center. Grba accepted and began working the midnight-to-7 
a.m. shift. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when all the dudes came in for help," Grba said. "I saw Eli Grba walk 
in night after night. I got an education; I got a real good education. I 
haven't had a drink since." 
</P>
<P>
Grba once had a fastball that blew past batters and a curve that left them 
swinging at air. He also had a mean streak that was 60 feet 6 inches long and a 
stretched from one batter's box to the other. Or so many of his former 
teammates said. 
</P>
<P>
"Eli had a psychological effect on hitters," said Thomas, now general manager 
for the Philadelphia Phillies. "They didn't dig in too often. He'd knock them 
down if they did." 
</P>
<P>
Grba also had a quick temper. It got him into trouble in bars and sometimes on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's most vivid memory of Grba was on a swing through New York in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were in town for a four-game series, but it rained the first three 
days. The weather cleared on Sunday and Grba was to pitch the first game of a 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hunt, word reached the Angels that Mickey Mantle had a huge 
hangover. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see Eli thinking, 'All I have to do is get past (Roger) Maris and I 
got it made,' " Hunt said. "Well, we were winning, 1-0, and Mantle comes up and 
hits a two-run homer off Eli. He was just fuming on the mound. We battled back 
and were leading, 4-2, late in the game. Mantle comes up with two runners on 
and hits a tremendous home run into the second deck. 
</P>
<P>
"Eli ran to the edge of the infield and chased Mickey around the bases, 
shouting obscenities at him all the way. I was in the outfield with my glove 
over my face. I didn't want anyone to see me laughing, especially Eli. Mantle 
hit home plate, with Eli right behind him, stumbled into the dugout and fell 
down on all fours, laughing. I've never seen Eli so angry." 
</P>
<P>
That competitive fire was one of the things the Los Angeles Angels liked about 
Grba when they made him their No. 1 selection, according to Bill Rigney, the 
team's manager. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago, Grba was a three-sport star at Bowen High School. He signed 
with the Boston Red Sox in 1952 and spent three years in the minors and two in 
the service before being traded to the Yankees in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Grba was 2-5 in 1959 and 6-4 with one save in 1960. He was used as a short man, 
middle man, a long man and, occasionally, as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
The 1960 draft was done by position and pitching was the first category. Rigney 
and general manager Fred Haney decided to pick Grba. 
</P>
<P>
"Haney had some information on Grba," Rigney said. "Fred was a great friend of 
Casey Stengel and Stengel told him that this guy was going to be a good 
starting pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Grba won the Angels' first game, a 7-2 complete-game victory over Baltimore. He 
finished the season with an 11-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
"Eli liked to win, especially against the Yankees," Thomas said. "He wanted to 
show them that they may have made a mistake. He had that kind of burning 
desire." 
</P>
<P>
Grba also liked to have a drink or two -- or three or four. He and Hunt rented 
a house in Inglewood that became a watering hole for many of the Angels and 
other professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"Eli enjoyed the life style of a rich and famous baseball player," said Jim 
Fregosi, who roomed with Grba in 1962. "We had a lot of fun in those days." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, as a team, quickly gained a reputation for their after-hours 
activity. This was, after all, a team that included Ryne Duran, another 
self-confessed alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew what happened off the field, but I knew I could find a team 
meeting going on in some bar if I looked hard enough," Rigney said. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one night in Baltimore, 16 of us went to dinner together," Grba 
said. "When the bill came, the bar tab was more than the food." In 1962 the 
Angels challenged for the pennant, staying in the race until September and 
finishing with an 86-76 record. 
</P>
<P>
Grba was 8-9 that season, but he said his drinking was starting to affect his 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, Grba pitched in only 12 games and had an 0-1 record. The Angels tried 
to trade him twice, but there were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
Grba was sold to Hawaii and never returned to the major leagues, although he 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched with Toronto in 1964 and Hawaii in 1965. In 1967, he tried to make 
it with the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"I was drinking heavy and I didn't care about anything," he said. "My 
priorities were all gone. Bob Lemon saw me one day and said, 'I've never seen a 
pitcher lose his stuff as fast as you did.' It was the booze. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always remember those years with the Angels. The closeness, the 
friendship, the foolishness. I'll also remember the deterioration of a damn 
good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Grba spent 10 months at the Wayne Fanning Alcohol Education Center -- the last 
five of which he was sober. 
</P>
<P>
He kept in touch with Hunt and the two patched up their differences. 
</P>
<P>
That December, Dick Phillips, an old friend, dropped into Hunt's bar. He had 
just been hired as the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers' triple-A team in 
Vancouver and was waiting for a flight. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt and Phillips talked for a while over drinks and then Grba's name came up. 
Hunt told him that Grba was sober and Phillips mentioned that he was looking 
for a pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
One thing led to another and Grba had a job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that I got back into baseball because of a conversation in a bar," 
Grba said. 
</P>
<P>
Grba was coaching in Vancouver on Aug. 1, 1982, when a man approached him. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wanted to do an interview, so we talked for a while," Grba said. 
"When it was over, he handed me this little box. Inside was my medallion. He 
said, 'Happy birthday, Eli.' " 
</P>
<P>
The medallion was to mark his first year of sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm never without it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grba spent seven years as a minor league coach with four organizations from 
1982-88. He also married for the third time, during a second stint with 
Vancouver in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Neither marriage nor the job lasted. He left Vancouver last winter after 
repeated problems on both fronts. Problems that he prefers not to talk about in 
great detail. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't handle some things very well," Grba said. "I let people get to me and 
I was acting like my old self." 
</P>
<P>
Grba's old temper was returning and he was worried that other former habits 
also might come back. So he went to Palm Springs to collect his thoughts and 
regain his perspective. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that Jack Patton, one of Reno's three owners, found him. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me and asked if I wanted the job. I asked what it paid," Grba said. 
"Jack said, 'Not much.' and I said I'd get back to him. I started thinking 
about how I always wanted to manage. I called him back and took the job." 
</P>
<P>
Grba is the manager, pitching coach and hitting instructor. He does it all with 
a calmness that even he says is a complete reversal from his former self. 
</P>
<P>
Against Riverside, a Reno player was called out on a close play at first base. 
Grba, from the third-base coaching box, extended his arms to show he thought 
the runner was safe and then shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played, nobody yelled more, no one jumped on umpires more or yakked 
more than me," Grba said. "It wasn't an act, it was my personality. I had to 
learn to overcome those things." 
</P>
<P>
Most of his players have little chance of making it in baseball. As an 
independent franchise, Reno gets mostly leftovers, players that major league 
organizations already have cut. 
</P>
<P>
Grba has tried to pass along what he has learned. He has even had one-to-one 
talks with certain players, whom he believes might have an alcohol problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell these guys to be prepared for when it's over," Grba said. "After this 
glorious life of baseball, there is still a lot of life left. It took me a long 
time to grow up. I don't want these kids to make my mistakes."

David Bretoi, one of the first thrift executives tapped to help regulators run 
failed savings and loans, has co-founded the Lighthouse Management Group in 
Brea to advise regulators and financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Bretoi is president of the Lighthouse group and John L. Carr, now running 
Gibraltar Savings for regulators, is chairman. The two men recently bought the 
firm, called FN Venture Corp., from its parent, First Nationwide Savings Bank 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Bretoi had been president of FN Venture since April, 1985, when he led a First 
Nationwide management team hired by federal regulators to operate Beverly Hills 
Savings &amp; Loan in Mission Viejo. Beverly Hills Savings was the first 
S&amp;L seized and kept open by regulators under its so-called management 
consignment program, and Bretoi stayed until the S&amp;L was sold at the end of 
last year to Michigan National Corp., a bank holding company outside Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
During his absence, First Nationwide was bought by Ford Motor Co. and his boss, 
Anthony M. Frank, left to become the U.S. postmaster general.

MAI CHANGES OFFER FOR PRIME TO CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MAI Basic Four Inc., hoping to keep alive its chances of acquiring Prime 
Computer's minicomputer business, revised its offer Tuesday to $525 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
MAI had offered $450 million in cash and notes with a face value of $150 
million. Analysts expect the new all-cash offer to be more attractive to 
Prime's lenders because of uncertain market value of the securities that MAI 
had offered. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a Tustin computer maker controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, 
recently dropped its nine-month effort to buy all of Prime. It now seeks to buy 
only Prime's minicomputer business, which accounts for one-third of sales at 
the computer company based in Natick, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Prime has rebuffed all of MAI's previous overtures. On June 23, it agreed to be 
acquired by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New York venture-capital firm, in a deal 
valued at $1.4 billion. The Whitney buyout hit a snag last week, however, when 
Chemical Bank in New York and First National Bank of Boston asked Whitney to 
raise more financing because of Prime's deteriorating financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's request came one day before Prime reported a $19-million loss for 
the quarter ended June 30. In the same quarter last year, it posted a 
$7.2-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney has said it is negotiating with potential lenders to try to raise more 
money. Donald Ackerman, a Whitney general partner, declined to comment Tuesday 
on efforts to get that financing. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have said Whitney's financing difficulties could help MAI's 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
MAI said in a prepared statement that it had amended its offer, which expires 
Aug. 9, "with a view to simplifying the choices available" to Prime's directors 
and shareholders. A company spokeswoman declined further comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said the company's board would meet to review 
MAI's new offer. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaghan said sales representatives, engineers and other workers have defected 
as the battle has dragged on, and customers have withheld orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attrition rates were and are greater than they normally are, and that is 
largely due to the uncertainty, not knowing what the future of the company is 
going to be," Gavaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's stock traded Tuesday at $15.75 a share, down from a high of $21 earlier 
this year and $4 a share below the estimated value of Whitney's offer. 
</P>
<P>
MAI posted net income of $7.9 million for the six months, ended March 31, in 
contrast with $11.9 million in earnings in the same period last year. The 
company, which will not make its next earnings report until Aug. 14, said it 
has been hurt by "adverse publicity generated as a result of Prime's efforts to 
resist" its offer. 
</P>
<P>
MAI's stock, which traded as high as $21 a share before the November takeover 
bid, has wallowed in the $5-a-share range. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street arbitragers and investors were hard-pressed to name a takeover 
battle that has dragged on as long and as publicly as the fight for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a general feeling of disgust out there," said Joseph Sheer, 
manager of risk arbitrage for McKinley Allsopp Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"This unending saga isn't good for customers, it isn't good for employees," 
said David Wu, an analyst with S.G. Warburg Inc. "This unending saga only makes 
lawyers rich."

O'LEARY WILL HEAD NATIONWIDE HOSPITAL NETWORK; 
</P>
<P>
ST. JOSEPH HEALTH PRESIDENT TO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Robert W. O'Leary will resign as chief executive of the St. Joseph Health 
System in Orange to become president and chief executive of Voluntary Hospitals 
of America Inc., a Dallas organization that provides services to a nationwide 
network of hospitals, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary, 45, has served as president and chief executive at St. Joseph Health 
System since 1983. The health-care organization, owned by the Sisters of St. 
Joseph of Orange, operates eight hospitals in California and Texas as well as 
Health Plan of America, a statewide health-care company composed of 60 
hospitals and 7,000 physicians. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary's selection was made early last week by VHA's board of directors. As of 
Tuesday, St. Joseph had not named his replacement. VHA spokesman Mack Haning 
said O'Leary's new appointment will become effective in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1977, VHA is a for-profit company owned by 100 of its 669 member 
hospitals. VHA's members in Southern California include Hoag Hospital in 
Newport Beach, Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Saddleback Hospital and Health 
Center in Laguna Hills and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Haning said the organization has undergone a major restructuring since 
September when its senior management resigned. He said the company had grown 
unwieldy from rapid expansion and one of its major for-profit subsidiaries, VHA 
Enterprises, was losing money. 
</P>
<P>
VHA Enterprises is developing a national health-care provider system in a 
venture with the Aetna Life Insurance Co. and will benefit from O'Leary's 
experience at developing a health-maintenance organization for St. Joseph of 
Orange, Haning said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary also will be in charge of managing the highly profitable VHA Supply 
Inc., which sells more than $2 billion in discounted products a year to member 
hospitals.

BRIEFCASE: CENTENNIAL BENEFICIAL CORP. CHANGES NAME, PARTLY OVER PUBLICITY 
FALLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's largest banking firm, Centennial Beneficial Corp. in Orange, 
has changed its name to West Coast Bancorp, partly because of unfavorable 
publicity involving its two major shareholder-founders. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial Beneficial is a profitable, publicly held holding company for 
financial institutions, including Sunwest Bank in Tustin, which it acquired in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
John B. Joseph and Ronald R. White, who own a total of about 20% of the banking 
firm, also started the publicly held Centennial Group two years ago to handle 
the six real estate limited partnerships they had formed. They own about 26% of 
the real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial Group has had cash-flow problems, and White and Joseph have been 
sued by investors. The company has come under critical news coverage in several 
publications, including Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial Group's problems have damaged Centennial Beneficial's success, said 
Frank E. Smith, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the 
banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend half my time explaining to people that Centennial Beneficial is not 
part of Centennial Group," he said. "If you track the time when Centennial 
Group was starting to make public disclosures about its condition and you track 
the two companies' stock prices, you'd see the prices went in tandem -- and it 
sure wasn't up." 
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading Tuesday, the real estate firm's stock was $1.75 a 
share, down 12.5 cents a share from Monday's close, while the banking firm's 
stock was $1.9375 a share, up 6.25 cents a share from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, Joseph and White insist, however, that the main reason for changing 
Centennial Beneficial's name is to identify the firm more closely with what it 
is and does. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast Bancorp, with $452 million in assets, owns Sunwest Bank, Sacramento 
First National Bank, Heritage Thrift &amp; Loan Assn. of Brea and West Coast 
Realty Finance in Orange, formerly Centennial Beneficial Mortgage Co.

46 INDICTED IN FUTURES FRAUD PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
CHICAGO CHARGES INCLUDE RACKETEERING, FALSE TAX RETURNS

<P>
A federal grand jury today indicted 46 commodity traders and brokers in the 
government's 2 1/2-year investigation into alleged fraud in Chicago's futures 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh announced at a news conference that charges include 
racketeering, mail fraud, commodities fraud and the filing of false tax returns 
and lying to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
The charges follow an undercover investigation by the FBI of traders at the 
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two 
largest futures exchanges. The landmark investigation first came to light in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, as many as 20 traders have agreed to plead 
guilty to fraud charges and will testify for the government against their 
colleagues to avoid stiffer penalties and long, expensive trials. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation centered on various alleged trading violations at the 
exchanges, including conspiracy to skim customer accounts and hide the profits 
from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents impersonated traders in several trading pits, including the soybean 
and Treasury bond trading pits at the CBT and the CME's Japanese yen, Swiss 
franc and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures pits. Agents secretly tape-recorded 
conversations and participated in illegal trades. 
</P>
<P>
Those charged were 19 traders from the soybean pit, three in the bond pit, 
three in the Swiss franc pit and 21 in the yen pit. 
</P>
<P>
Also present for the announcement of the indictments were FBI Director William 
S. Sessions, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Wendy Gramm and U.S. 
Atty. Anton Valukas, whose office led the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Valukas said traders broke the law and the rules of the exchange by arranging 
deals with one another before and after the pits opened for trading. 
</P>
<P>
He said the federal investigation will continue beyond the current indictments. 
"This is an ongoing investigation. It is not a concluded investigation. This is 
the first step in what we will be doing in connection with these matters," 
Valukas said.

Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan was under investigation by the Justice 
Department over allegations of involvement in Nazi persecution, but the case 
against him was dropped when he died last month, a government lawyer said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Had he lived, "there might have been a question of the watch list" -- putting 
the famed musician on a list of people banned from the United States for their 
Nazi pasts -- said Neal M. Sher who heads the Justice Department's Office of 
Special Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations were that Karajan might have worked for the Nazi security 
police and might have had a role in ridding German orchestras of Jews and other 
"non-Aryans," Sher said.

RECALL AGAINST FOUNTAIN VALLEY COUNCILMAN QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT 
</P>

<P>
The campaign to recall Fountain Valley City Councilman Fred Voss, convicted in 
March of soliciting sex, has succeeded in qualifying for the November ballot, 
the city clerk said today. 
</P>
<P>
The county registrar's office has verified at least 6,174 signatures on recall 
petitions, which contained 7,028 signatures, said City Clerk J. E. de Sevren 
Jacquet. 
</P>
<P>
The petition is expected to be certified by the registrar, and Jacquet will 
present it to the City Council at a special meeting at 12:15 p.m. Friday. The 
council is expected to order that the recall be placed on the November ballot, 
Jacquet said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Moss, a spokesman for the Fred Voss Recall Committee, said today, "We 
were expecting it, but it's still good news to hear that we did it." 
</P>
<P>
The group of Fountain Valley residents launched the recall drive against Voss, 
52, after he was convicted of trying to solicit sex from a Santa Ana 
policewoman posing as a prostitute. Voss stepped down as mayor but has 
continued as a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75 volunteers worked for weeks to obtain the needed signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Jacquet said at least 6,154 signatures -- 20% of the registered voters in the 
city -- were required to qualify the petition for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Voss, who could not be reached for comment, has decided to fight the recall and 
has formed a No on Recall of Fred Voss Committee to raise funds.

U.S. ENVOY MAKES PERSONAL PLEA TO SOVIETS ON HOSTAGES; 
</P>
<P>
APPEAL SEEN AS DRAMATIC TEST OF TIES

<P>
In a dramatic test of new Soviet-American contacts aimed at combating 
terrorism, the United States has asked the Kremlin for its help in determining 
the status of American and other Western hostages held by militant Muslims in 
Lebanon, informed sources said here today. 
</P>
<P>
The request, which follows the reported killing of an American hostage Monday 
and a threat to kill another Thursday, was made at a hastily called meeting 
today between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and U.S. 
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass press agency reported the meeting in a three-line announcement this 
afternoon. A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy, confirming that the meeting had 
taken place, said it had come at Matlock's request, lasted for "less than an 
hour" and was intended "to convey the deep concern of the U.S. government 
regarding the hostages being held in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Neither side provided any further details, but an informed source said Matlock 
had sought Soviet assistance "in the new spirit of cooperation the two 
countries have declared in the battle against terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
The hostage situation was discussed last January by American and Soviet 
civilian experts at an unprecedented bilateral symposium on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details Lacking 
</P>
<P>
Another source termed the contact useful but refused to provide any details of 
the Soviet response. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place only hours after Shevardnadze returned from what Tass 
said was "a brief working visit to Tehran," where he met with the new Iranian 
president, Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said, "Shevardnadze touched on the exacerbation of the situation in 
Lebanon, including in connection with the abduction of Sheik (Abdel Karim) 
Obeid, a Shiite leader, and the execution of U.S. citizen William Higgins, who 
was taken hostage." 
</P>
<P>
According to Tass, Rafsanjani "voiced deep regret over what has happened and 
confirmed that Iran does not have relation to the tragedy which broke out in 
Lebanon." It said the two sides "denounced any actions of a terrorist nature 
and favored the adoption of urgent measures to prevent a further sharpening of 
the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli commandos seized Obeid, a leading pro-Iranian Muslim militant, in a 
raid into south Lebanon last Friday, reportedly hoping to exchange him for 
three Israeli servicemen held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Issues Demands 
</P>
<P>
A Shiite group known as the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth demanded 
that Obeid be freed by Monday, but the Israelis refused. On Monday the group 
announced that it had hanged Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 44, the Marine Corps 
officer seized in February, 1988, while serving as a U.N. truce observer in 
southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of Higgins' reported death have not been confirmed. A special 
U.N. envoy, Marrack Goulding, arrived in Beirut today to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Another pro-Iranian Shiite group, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, has 
said it will kill another American hostage, Joseph J. Cicippio, 58, if Obeid is 
not released by Thursday.

The smog over western Montana valleys today was so unusual that the National

the crud was.

<P>
Visibility in Helena was only six miles this morning, virtually opaque by 
Montana standards. Tuesday afternoon, the visibility was 40 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service explained that the dirty air was "a weather phenomenon 
usually seen in the industrial Eastern United States." 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, high humidity, high pressure at the surface and a high 
concentration of industrial pollutants combine in the populated Eastern United 
States to produce a milky dirty sky during the day along with reduced 
visibilities," the weather service said in an advisory that goes to radio 
stations and newspapers.

KNEW RISKS IN KIDNAPING, RABIN ASSERTS;

DANGER FOR HOSTAGES 'AND WORSE' WEIGHED, ISRAELI MINISTER SAYS

<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today that Israel's abduction of a Muslim 
clergyman was carried out in the knowledge that pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon 
might kill Western hostages "and worse." 
</P>
<P>
Answering three leftist no-confidence motions in Parliament, Rabin also 
disclosed that the Cabinet approved Friday's capture of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He said final approval was delayed until "every grain of possibility for 
dialogue" had been exhausted on winning the release of three Israeli soldiers 
believed held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Countries Not Informed 
</P>
<P>
Rabin said Israel did not inform any other country of its intentions to abduct 
Obeid. "We didn't include any other country before the action and did not even 
offer information about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin told Parliament that Israel has rejected an International Red Cross 
appeal to visit Obeid, who was abducted along with two associates from the 
south Lebanon village of Jibchit. 
</P>
<P>
He said Israel will agree only if the Red Cross is able to visit Israeli 
captives. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin defended the Obeid kidnaping against criticism that Israel did not 
consider the dangers to foreign hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"We took into consideration all the possible reactions," he said. "We saw them 
all, including the actions that already took place, and ones even worse." 
</P>
<P>
A Shiite group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said 
it killed Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on Monday after Israel refused to 
free Obeid. A second group said another American hostage, Joseph J. Cicippio, 
will be killed Thursday unless the cleric is freed. 
</P>
<P>
Israel maintains that Higgins was killed several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin said the Cabinet approved the abduction of Obeid, a spiritual leader of 
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement that is believed an umbrella group for 
hostage-takers in Lebanon, after extensive efforts to gain freedom for its 
captured soldiers. He did not detail those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Successful' 
</P>
<P>
He described the abduction of Obeid, whom he accused of involvement in Higgins 
kidnap and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers, as "very successful." 
</P>
<P>
The defense minister was interrupted at one point by an Arab member of 
Parliament, Mohammed Miari, who chided Rabin for announcing his hostage swap 
offer 30 minutes after the deadline set for Higgins' purported hanging. 
</P>
<P>
Communist and Arab legislators accused the government of kidnaping Obeid to 
divert attention from efforts to resolve the Palestinian problem and end the 
uprising against Israeli occupation.

President Bush reached a compromise with key senators from both parties today 
on legislation extending the nation's civil rights laws to protect the disabled 
from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The accord was announced by the White House shortly before the Senate Labor 
Committee revised and approved the measure on a 16-0 vote, sending it to the 
full chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would prohibit discrimination in the workplace or in public 
accommodations based on a physical disability, paralleling the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act that bans bias based on race, sex, national origin or religion. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching the compromise, the senators basically went along with the 
Administration on penalties for violations, while the White House went along 
with them on the scope of coverage, officials said.

A former education minister who served a reform-minded government in the 1970s 
emerged today as front-runner in the race to become Japan's next prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiki Kaifu became the leading choice to replace Sosuke Uno, who has been in 
power only two months, after 78-year-old Toshio Komoto said he would not run 
for president of the deeply troubled Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu acknowledged receiving about $110,000 in political funds from the Recruit 
Co., at the center of the influence-buying scandal that has rocked Japan's 
political Establishment. But he said that all the donations had been reported, 
and that he had stopped receiving money from the company after the scandal 
burst last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats are to choose a new leader on Tuesday to replace Uno who 
was forced to resign in a sex scandal.

20 HUD CONSULTANTS PAID $5.7 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
FUNNELING OF FUNDS TO STATES WITHOUT STRONG NEEDS REPORTED

<P>
Twenty consultants earned more than $5.7 million by helping funnel much of the 
money in a federal housing program to developers in a handful of states that 
did not need it, a Senate committee was told today. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 20 consultants were former employees of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development or well-connected Republicans, HUD Inspector General Paul 
Adams said in a report to the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants were paid by developers to help them get about one-fifth of the 
money from a HUD program to repair housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so lucrative now that you're going to get some people doing some pretty 
unsavory things to feed at that trough," Donald Terner, president of the 
nonprofit Bridge Housing Corp. in San Francisco, told the Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Adams said the well is starting to run dry for the outside consultants and 
some billings have not been paid in full because of the recent media attention. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on Capitol Hill today, the House Government Operations subcommittee 
on housing voted 6 to 0 to subpoena Lance Wilson, a former aide to former HUD 
Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. Wilson had been scheduled to voluntarily testify 
last week, but did not appear, saying that he was not prepared with legal 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Leaders Spar 
</P>
<P>
And on the Senate floor, the two party leaders sparred over the HUD scandal, 
with Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) saying the department was "used 
as a political slush fund where political appointees gave favors . . . to 
politically well-connected individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also criticized the leadership of HUD in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration for not heeding the warnings of the inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) then complained that appointments to several 
HUD posts have been bottled up awaiting confirmation by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's make certain we understand that Congress hasn't been very cooperative," 
Dole said. "Now we've got a situation where Secretary (Jack) Kemp is trying to 
do the right thing, and he doesn't have anybody on board." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Banking Committee voted 17 to 0 today to approve one of those 
appointees, C. Austin Fitts, as an assistant HUD secretary. The nomination of 
Fitts, who would replace Thomas Demery, one of the central figures in the HUD 
scandal, now goes to the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"During our survey, five developers informed us that because of all the recent 
media attention, some billings were not paid in full" to them, Adams wrote in 
his report. 
</P>
<P>
One of those consultants was Fred Bush, ambassador-designate to Luxembourg, who 
has had $45,000 in payments withheld since April, the report said. Bush is no 
relation to the President but was the chief fund-raiser for his 1988 campaign.

Female security forces dragged a dozen praying women from Judaism's holiest 
shrine, the Wailing Wall, when disturbances erupted during a service today. 
</P>
<P>
A group called Women at the Wall aroused anger among ultra-orthodox Jews by 
holding collective prayers on the women's side of the wall. The ultra-orthodox 
believe women's voices should not be heard during prayer. 
</P>
<P>
One woman screamed at the group, throwing water and gravel at them. Others 
yelled for quiet, creating a din above the prayers. About 50 of the women sat 
with linked arms to avoid being carted off.

West Germany's largest publishing chain today ended a practice that has irked 
authorities in East Germany for 40 years -- placing quotation marks around 
every reference to West Germany's socialist sibling state. 
</P>
<P>
The quotation marks have cost Axel Springer newspapers and magazines 
journalistic accreditation in East Germany and readership among much of West 
Germany's left-leaning populace. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to East Germany as "DDR," the German abbreviation for Deutsche 
Demokratische Republik (German Democratic Republic), was the protest of the 
publishing chain's founder, Axel Springer, who died nearly four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's division after World War II weighed heavily on Springer, who moved 
his prospering business from his native Hamburg to West Berlin in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
After construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, he put up a lighted reader board 
to flash news from the West across the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope for reunification is unshaken," Manfred Schell, editor in chief of 
the conservative daily Die Welt, wrote today. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the light of changes in East-West relations, the barriers to improving 
the flow of information between the political blocs must fall, Schell added. 
</P>
<P>
The giant Springer publishing network includes Europe's largest-circulation 
daily, Hamburg-based Bild Zeitung, which sells nearly 5 million copies daily. 
It also includes the influential Berliner Morgenpost and Bonn's Die Welt. 
</P>
<P>
Circulation of Springer's main dailies has fallen as much as 10% in the last 
few years, and many attribute the drop to shifts within the West German 
populace toward detente with nations of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.

The Coca-Cola Co. announced a television advertising campaign today targeting 
Hispanics but drew immediate criticism from some Spanish-lanugage newspapers 
because they are being excluded from the effort. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, called "Discovery 92: Heritage and Future," includes English, 
Spanish and bilingual commercials featuring actress Rita Moreno and regional 
Hispanic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, representatives of Coke told disgruntled Spanish-language 
newspaper publishers they would consider expanding the campaign to include 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disturbed that there is no allocation for Spanish-language print 
advertising," said Aaron G. Lopez, the publisher of El Directorio Hispano, a 
bilingual newspaper based in Reading, Pa.

Sales of new homes, propelled by falling mortgage rates, rose 5.5% in June, the 
third consecutive monthly increase, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes rose to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000 units in June as the housing 
industry continued to rebound from a sluggish period earlier in the year when 
sales fell to their lowest level since the 1981-82 recession. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed mortgage rates dipped last week to 9.81%, their lowest point since April, 
1987. Fixed-rate mortgages peaked in March at 11.22%.

U.S. PROBES CLAIM OF BOEING OVERCHARGES AND DOUBLE BILLING

<P>
The federal government is investigating allegations that the Boeing Co. 
overcharged and double-billed the Department of Defense millions of dollars for 
repairs of buildings leased for secret military work. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation by two defense agencies, a congressional panel, and 
reportedly, the Department of Justice's criminal division, was sparked by a 
Boeing electrical engineer and inspector, Kevin G. Kelly, who was fired Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But it has gone beyond his allegations, said an investigator for a congressman 
looking into the case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation appears to have started with Boeing's lease of buildings 
under government contract from millionaire Seattle developer David Sabey, 
according to an internal Boeing memorandum obtained by Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings were built to Boeing's specifications by Sabey, but Kelly said 
three buildings at one office park were substandard and required $3 million in 
electrical and other repairs and improvements, and that Boeing billed the 
government for the work, rather than Sabey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder confirmed Tuesday that an investigation is under 
way and read a statement: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kelly noted some items that he concluded did not meet building and 
electrical codes. The items he noted were thoroughly investigated by Boeing and 
corrective actions were taken where appropriate. Additionally, the buildings 
were inspected and approved by the appropriate local government agencies." 
</P>
<P>
Binder, Boeing's director of public relations, declined further comment on the 
investigation and Kelly's firing. 
</P>
<P>
Sabey was unavailable, his secretary said. Sabey Corp. attorney Don Berdick 
said the firm would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
The leases with Sabey include buildings at two office parks used by Boeing 
Advanced Systems for military work. The Boeing division has defense contracts 
and subcontracts that range from work on the B-2 Stealth bomber to guided 
missile systems and avionic research. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly contends he was fired for alerting federal officials to Boeing billing 
the Defense Department for the repairs at the Oxbow office park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Boeing Ignored Warnings 
</P>
<P>
He said Boeing ignored his early warnings that electrical work in the buildings 
was substandard. In a July 18 letter to Boeing Chief Executive Officer Frank 
Schrontz, Kelly contended he was "effectively quieted by Boeing management" and 
"I have not been able to intelligently and satisfactorily discuss with 
supervisors the substandard workmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Schrontz's secretary said her boss would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
"People in management have been covering up," Kelly asserted Tuesday. "Not one 
man in that whole group had the courage to stand up and tell Sabey the 
buildings were substandard. Instead, they said 'Let the taxpayer pay for it.' "

The Boston Celtics, taking the view that 6-foot-10 Dino Radja was an amateur 
with his former Yugoslavian basketball club, have signed him to a one-year 
contract in the very professional National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very nice now," said Radja after his first official NBA workout with 
the Celtics at Brandeis University on Tuesday, but he admitted that he felt bad 
that his Yugoslavian team, Jugoplastika, had been unsupportive and 
uncooperative in his pursuit of a basketball career in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavian club maintains that Radja signed a four-year pact and is 
committed to it through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Celtics General Manager Jan Volk disagrees. "Their contract is an equivalent of 
an amateur contract," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of his contract were not made public, but Radja said he feels like "the 
richest man in the world."

Pressure is building to postpone the debut of a new international football 
league for a year, with American television applying the latest squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
No decision on a start-up date for the World League of American Football has 
been made, sources said today as Commissioner Tex Schramm and other league 
officials met with prospective owners and visited possible stadiums for its 
flagship London franchise. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, however, NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol said his 
network would not be interested in a 1990 start for the spring league, and 
football officials indicated that 1991 is looking more and more likely for the 
first season. 
</P>
<P>
"1991 seems to be the choice of the majority of WLAF board of directors," NFL 
spokesman Joe Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm was unavailable for comment today. He is scheduled to hold a press 
conference here Thursday, but sources said no announcement on a start-up date 
is expected. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, who asked not to be identified, also said reports in some British 
newspapers today that a decision has been made to postpone the start for one 
year were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said NBC might bid for TV rights to a league beginning in 1991, "but 
under no circumstance will we bid in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The NBC executive said next year is "too soon (for the league) to have a real, 
honest chance to make money." 
</P>
<P>
CBS hasn't shown much interest in the new league because it would conflict with 
the network's coverage of the NBA and, beginning next year, major league 
baseball. That leaves ABC as the only possible network outlet in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL owners voted last month to go ahead with the international league and 
will help to stock the teams -- four in Europe, six in North America -- with 
players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The league is supposed to start with European franchises in London; Frankfurt, 
West Germany; Milan, Italy, and either Paris or Barcelona, Spain. There would 
be North American franchises in Canada, Mexico and in four U.S. cities.

SOVIET OLYMPIC GYMNAST DROPPED OVER HIS BOOZING

Olympic triple gold medalist Dimitry Bilozerchev has been dropped from the 
Soviet team for the World Gymnastics Championships because he went on a two-day 
drinking binge, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Bilozerchev, 22, and teammate Vladimir Gogoladze "had a corrupting influence on 
other members of the team," top Soviet gymnastics official Leonid Arkayev told 
Sovietsky Sport. Gogoladze was also dropped, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Bilozerchev was known to have an alcohol problem. He was in an auto accident in 
1985 while driving drunk and broke his leg but recovered to compete again. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he made a spectacular comeback, scoring six perfect marks and 
winning gold medals in the pommel horse and rings and as part of the Soviet 
men's team at the Seoul Olympics. He also took the bronze medal in the men's 
all-around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbor's Warning 
</P>
<P>
The World Gymnastics Championships are scheduled for Stuttgart, West Germany, 
Oct. 15 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
Sovietsky Sport said a neighbor of Bilozerchev's had warned the newspaper 
before the 1985 accident that the gymnast was drinking too much vodka. He was 
almost expelled from the Soviet team just before the Seoul Olympics for his 
drinking, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Sovietsky Sport said his latest problems started when Bilozerchev and Gogoladze 
failed to show up at a sports training center during a drinking binge. 
</P>
<P>
Bilozerchev had announced at the beginning of the year that he would give up 
gymnastics.

Gene Murphy has signed a three-year contract extension to continue as Cal State 
Fullerton's head football coach through the 1992 season, the school announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 49, is about to begin his 10th season with the Titans, who have 
finished first or second in the Big West Conference in five of the last six 
seasons. He signed a five-year contract after the 1984 season, when Fullerton 
was credited with an unbeaten season after Nevada-Las Vegas was forced to 
forfeit the only loss on the Titans' 11-1 on-the-field record. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's nine-season record at Fullerton is 48-56 (50-54, including two 
opponent forfeits), even though the Titans played 70 of those 104 games on the 
road. Murphy had previously been 15-7 in two seasons at North Dakota.

The International Motor Sports Assn. ruled today that Price Cobb of Evergreen, 
Colo., won Sunday's G. I. Joe's Camel Gran Prix because he was leading when the 
starter mistakenly waved the checkered flag three laps too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"While the starter could give no reason for doing it and it was definitely 
erroneous, it still was a checkered flag," association spokesman Adam Saal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Starter David Long waved the flag at the end of the 94th lap of what was 
supposed to be a 97-lap race at Portland International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb said he backed off slightly after he saw the flag, then started racing 
again. Australian Geoff Brabham took the lead from Cobb on the final turn of 
lap 96, finished first and was declared the provisional winner. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb filed a protest, and it was upheld by acting race director Cameron 
Argetsinger.
