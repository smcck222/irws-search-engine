Many Americans remain fat because they refuse to exercise while they diet, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control. CDC researchers reported that 
43.6% of overweight men and 63.9% of women tried to lose weight only by eating 
fewer calories, and 24.3% of heavy men and 34.7% of the overweight women 
increased their physical activity but did not diet. "We need to incorporate 
physical activity along with caloric restriction," said Eddas M. Bennett, a CDC 
epidemiologist. "One is not better without the other. You really need both." 
The CDC survey found that 34 million Americans -- about one in four adults -- 
are overweight by 20% or more. Bennett blamed the unwillingness to exercise on 
the preoccupation with fad diets and a "more sedentary" life style.

South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae Jung said that a 22-hour interrogation 
by security agents failed to implicate him in an unauthorized trip last year to 
Communist North Korea by National Assembly member Suh Kyung Won, who was 
arrested June 28 and charged with espionage. Kim told a news conference at the 
headquarters of his Party for Peace and Democracy that he was cleared of any 
suspicion, and he charged that his questioning by authorities was an effort to 
undermine his party's image. Suh was expelled from Kim's party after his 
arrest. Government security officials said that since questioning was legally 
limited to 24 hours and Kim issued "adamant denials," they simply ran out of 
time.

It's a vintage Boy Scout gag, but he fell for it. "They gave me a rucksack and 
put me out in the mountains," Steven Spielberg told some 400 Scouts chosen as 
hometown correspondents at the 12th National Scout Jamboree at Ft. A. P. Hill, 
Va. "(They) told me to bring some snipe home." The boys laughed as he told the 
story of spending 2 1/2 hours hunting the legendary bird. "Mercifully, I saw 
flashlights and heard someone calling out my name. The Scout leaders got me out 
and said: 'Welcome to the Boy Scouts of America.' " Later, the movie producer 
addressed about 70,000 Scouts, leaders and visitors who had gathered for the 
evening ceremony in an amphitheater and to see him awarded the Distinguished 
Eagle Scout award for his work in films and his involvement in scouting. "I 
think the proudest moment of my entire life was when I became an Eagle Scout," 
he said. And, although he said being a Scout "taught me how to speak out," 
Spielberg, 41, confessed that being in the public eye makes him uncomfortable. 
"Believe it or not, this is not exactly the easiest thing for me, getting out 
in front of people to talk," he said. "But I like talking to you guys. You're 
the best. You're the Scouts. We're brothers."

 -- Six Southeast Asian leaders joined Sultan Hassanai Bolkiah of Brunei to 
mark the coming of age of the sultan's 15-year-old son, Prince Al-Muhtadee 
Billah. The snooker-loving prince sat impassively on a throne in the sprawling 
palace of one of the world's richest men as the 400-year-old ceremony unfolded, 
replete with gongs, cymbals and attendants carrying lances, swords, shields, 
candles and personal regalia. Indonesian President Suharto, Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Philippine President Corazon Aquino, Singapore Prime 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan sprinkled 
scented water on the prince to bless him. The ceremony was televised live 
Wednesday night and Thursday.

 -- What does it take to get your name affixed to medical buildings at the 
University of Utah Medical School? Apparently a gift of $16.3 million won't 
make the grade. J.L. Sorenson, 68, who built a fortune estimated at $360 
million in the medical equipment business, made the donation in June and 
officials at the state-supported university at Salt Lake City agreed to name 
the medical facility for him. But faculty, students and Utah lawmakers 
protested that such a step is generally restricted to business and private 
colleges. Sorenson told university officials in a letter that he would 
understand if they decided the name change was not feasible. And he said they 
could keep the money. LARRY PRYOR

The new baby weighs in at 100 pounds, measures 7 feet long, has electric blue 
hair, and is nicknamed Stuffee. 
</P>
<P>
Stuffee is the brain child of Kidspace Museum in Pasadena, which created the 
bigger-than-life doll to teach kids about good health. Stuffee has a zipper in 
its chest, which when opened reveals internal organs -- stomach, lungs, heart 
-- sculpted from soft fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
The doll even has its own house and mailbox where children can write and ask 
health-related questions. The staff at Huntington Memorial Hospital will help 
him with the answers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite an expensive doll -- $6,000" conceded museum spokeswoman Elaine 
Fleming, noting that Stuffee was paid for by a grant from the Pasadena 
Foundation. "But, he's custom-made, has a heartbeat and pulse, and most 
important, the kids love him."

L.A.'s superstar Michael Jackson is giving the California Raisin Advisory Board 
a hand -- the silver lame-gloved one -- plus lending his face to those famous 
dancing raisins. 
</P>
<P>
The California Raisin Advisory Board is spending $11 million on this year's 
campaign, which will include commercials featuring a dancing raisin, called 
"Michael Raisin" complete with silver glove, and a character that looks like 
Jackson. The commercials are debuting now in movie theaters and will move to 
television this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a big fan of the sculptures created by Will Vinton of Portland, used a 
Claymation "Speed Demon" figure in his Moonwalker music video. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us wanted a commercial where Michael just dances for a product," says 
Robert Phinney of the raisin board. "In this spot, Michael actually becomes the 
product -- Michael Raisin." 
</P>
<P>
There's good news for rodent lovers. There are enough in Los Angeles for 
everyone. County health officials say that what's good for Los Angeles tourists 
-- sunny skies and warm temperatures -- is also good for the city's rat 
population. Seems the little creatures really enjoy the warm climate and 
abundance of fruit and berries. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that this summer, like others, there is a rodent population 
explosion. The county hasn't gone out personally and counted them, but it 
estimates there are probably about 8 million rats out there, one for every 
person in the county, according to Ray Honda of the county Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't want yours, you can call County Vector Control for help. But they 
get about 10,000 calls a year, so you'll have to get in line to ask for an 
inspector to come out and take care of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
It might be simpler to adopt them. One can choose from the Norway rat, the 
urban dweller, which grows to be 10 inches long with an 8-inch tail and weighs 
a pound; or there's the more compact variety called the roof rat, which weighs 
only half a pound and likes climbing avocado trees in the suburbs. They aren't 
picky eaters. Both eat about an ounce of food per day, and will drink out of 
sprinklers or even lick the sweat off pipes.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL LAYS OFF 20, CUTS WORK HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, as expected, has laid off 12 full-time employees 
and eight part-time workers, and reduced the hours of 19 other people, said 
hospital President John Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, five unfilled jobs were eliminated and four people were 
transferred to other positions. The actions, which will save the hospital $1.1 
million, are part of a previously announced plan to eliminate the equivalent of 
100 full-time jobs by Oct. 1. Wilson said the actions accounted for 36 of those 
job equivalents and affected 13 hospital departments. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he hopes further reductions can be achieved "through attrition and 
normal turnover" without the necessity of more layoffs or reduced hours. The 
hospital is trying to overcome a $9-million loss in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since launching a program earlier this year to streamline the hospital and stem 
financial losses, San Pedro Peninsula has laid off 129 people and reduced the 
hours of 45 others.

The Miramar Naval Air Station has extended its airfield hours past the normal 
midnight curfew to accommodate extra nighttime training, the Navy reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Squadrons of E-2 Sea Hawkeyes and F-14 Tomcats last week began a refresher 
course in nighttime maneuvers such as takeoffs and landings, said Chief Petty 
Officer Bobbie Carleton. Because of the large number of air crews and aircraft 
involved, the training sessions are ending as late as 2 or 3 a.m., Carleton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Daylight savings time also pushes back the start time for the training 
sessions, Carleton said. The late night training is expected to continue until 
Aug. 17.

YOUTHS PLAY WITH GUN; CHULA VISTA GIRL, 13, IS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old girl was fatally wounded Wednesday in Chula Vista when she was 
shot with a gun belonging to a U. S. Border Patrol agent that the agent's son 
and the girl's younger brother had been playing with, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal Ray Ross, 13, of the 700 block of Date Avenue, was pronounced dead 
about 1 a.m. Thursday at UCSD Medical Center, according to Deputy Coroner Jerry 
Hillbrand. 
</P>
<P>
She was shot once in the head about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, said Chula Vista 
Police Sgt. Richard Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal and her 11-year-old brother were at an apartment in the 200 block of 
Quintard Street where her 14-year-old boyfriend lived with his parents, 
Strickland said. The names of the Border Patrol officer and the boys were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The youths had been at the apartment for about an hour when the shooting 
occurred. The boyfriend's parents were at work. 
</P>
<P>
The youths found a .357 Magnum and bullets in a bedroom, Strickland said. 
Knives and ammunition were found in a box in a closet and the gun was found 
under a floorboard, Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons belonged to the boyfriend's father, a Border Patrol agent, 
Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old boy loaded a "wad cutter" -- a bullet used for target shooting 
-- into the gun, Strickland said. The gun was left on the floor, where 
Crystal's boyfriend picked it up a short while later, thinking it was empty, 
Strickland said.

ESCONDIDO, RINCON REACH ACCORD ON FIRE, PARAMEDIC PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warring factions in a battle over fire and paramedic services have approved a 
pact that will give about 13,500 Escondido-area residents uninterrupted 
emergency services from now on. 
</P>
<P>
The rural residents who live outside Escondido city limits faced the loss of 
city fire services after the Rincon Del Diablo Municipal Water District 
requested, and the Escondido City Council approved, cancellation of a five-year 
pact under which the city provided the emergency services along the city's 
southern boundaries and in unincorporated residential pockets to the north of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The water district's board and council members unanimously approved the new 
agreement Wednesday night after residents in the outlying areas had told both 
bodies in angry terms that it was time to forget their differences and strike a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Both the City Council, which last week had voted to cancel the fire services 
contract, and the Rincon board, which earlier had requested the contract 
cancellation, expressed satisfaction with the new pact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voice in the Operation 
</P>
<P>
Fred Adjarian, water district general manager, said the agreement will allow 
water board members to have a say in the operation of the city's fire-paramedic 
services to their rural customers and to arbitrate any major problems that may 
arise. 
</P>
<P>
Without that, Adjarian explained, the rural residents would be subjected to 
"taxation without representation." Rural customers pay $72 a year for city 
emergency services, but have no vote in city elections. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue that had separated the two agencies was settled when Rincon 
agreed to withdraw from an automatic aid agreement with several other fire 
departments, including Deer Springs. Escondido fire officials had requested the 
cancellation of all automatic aid pacts because it requires city firefighters 
to respond to distant rural fires, leaving urban areas of the city unprotected.

INTELLIGENCE IGNORANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At almost the same moment that the Senate was voting for a $305-billion 
military budget in 1990, President Bush was candidly acknowledging to reporters 
that "we're dealing with less than a full deck" when it comes to knowing what's 
going on in Lebanon. The Senate's action and Bush's lament again underscore one 
of the harsher truths about the limits and possibilities of national security 
efforts. Hundreds of billions are each year devoted to defense and billions 
more to the intelligence services, but for all this mighty endeavor the United 
States still finds itself baffled and frustrated as it tries to respond to the 
barbarism of a handful of fanatics. Those who remember the Iran hostage crisis 
of a decade ago will recognize the bleak familiarity of those feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Ignorance about the adversaries the United States now faces in Lebanon -- about 
who they are and how they can best be dealt with -- may well be irremediable, 
given the seemingly impenetrable clannishness of the most extreme of Lebanon's 
anti-American factions. The broader shortage of good tactical intelligence 
about Lebanon and other Third World countries is less excusable. For decades, 
the focus of U.S. intelligence efforts has been on technical 
information-gathering, especially with regard to the Soviet Union and its 
allies. The results have been impressive, in some cases remarkable. But one 
consequence of this heavy emphasis -- which disturbed many intelligence 
specialists even as it was occurring -- has been that human intelligence 
efforts in areas of lesser importance, like Lebanon, have been slighted. 
</P>
<P>
The United States used to be able to count on informers within the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and on close cooperation with Israeli intelligence to 
keep up with who was who and what was what in Lebanon. But Iran's revolution in 
1979 and Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 changed the picture greatly by 
encouraging the emergence of the long-neglected Lebanese Shiite minority as a 
major political force. The Hezbollah, the most pro-Iran and anti-Western of the 
Shiite groups, is composed mainly of people who are related to or otherwise 
know each other. Organizations can often be penetrated by intelligence 
services; families and cliques are another matter. It is the solidarity and 
secretiveness of Hezbollah that now make intelligence-gathering in Lebanon so 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
The outrages that have been committed in Lebanon -- the original seizure of 
hostages and the apparent murder of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins -- cry out for 
an effective response. The key word here remains effective. Everyone wishes 
something could be done. What is still lacking, as the President conceded this 
week, are the essential facts to decide what should be done. Ignorance adds to 
the frustration. It also points up the need to fill existing political 
intelligence gaps -- and by no means in Lebanon only -- as quickly and to the 
fullest extent possible.

STEALTH BOMBER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column by Gen. John T. Chain Jr., commander in chief of the Strategic Air 
Command, who argues for development of the B-2 bomber, is a disturbing one ("A 
Bomber for the 21st Century, Today," Op-Ed Page, July 24). After nearly a 
decade of keeping the B-2 budget under secret wraps he and the Air Force have 
brought it out of the "black program" closet so that the U.S. may "reap the 
benefits of long years of effort, expense and bipartisan support." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it curious that once the price tag and intended mission for the plane 
were opened to public scrutiny, the bipartisan support faded, the price tag 
showed we can ill-afford the bomber and the "long years of effort" depicted a 
nearly two-year delay in a program that is managed by a contractor under 
federal indictment for fraud, waste and abuse of taxpayers' money? 
</P>
<P>
We don't need a manned Stealth bomber. Gen. Chain notes the bomber is favored 
because we can recall it, making it a more stabilizing threat than the ICBM. 
True, but existing bombers equipped with low-cost unmanned cruise missiles can 
be recalled, and if unleashed can strike their targets from standoff ranges of 
several thousand miles. The Soviets have admitted that they are fearful of the 
cruise missiles which can be launched in droves and are hard to detect, track 
and shoot down. Carrying a new stealth cruise missile sounds like a good role 
for the $28 billion worth of B-1Bs that we just finished paying for. 
</P>
<P>
Even with stealth capabilities, it's unlikely that the B-2 will be able to 
penetrate the Soviet motherland without the crew being overcome by radiation, 
heat and nuclear pulses. And even if they made it there, who is going to be 
around to tell them which targets to strike after the first wave of an ICBM 
attack? As a nation we are preoccupied with posturing ourselves to fight a 
nuclear war with the Soviets, a highly unlikely scenario, when we should focus 
our attention on beefing up conventional forces and countering Third-World 
belligerents.

While the B-2 is a neat looking plane with the latest technology, it's no 
bargain for the nation at some $500 million per plane and adds nothing to the 
triad of bombers, ICBMs and sea-launched ballistic missiles. With SLBMs and 
ICBMs we can strike hardened Soviet targets -- including command and control 
centers -- with pinpoint accuracy. Putting a fleet of 132 B-2 insurance 
policies costing $70 billion on the Tarmac will not buy us more deterrence, it 
will just buy us more debt. We should be spending our defense dollars on 
building up our conventional forces and weapons and in capabilities to counter 
terrorism and regional wars. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago an Air Force colonel involved in policy and planning at the 
Pentagon told me, after a series of highly classified meetings on strategic 
systems, "The B-2 is dead, you heard it here first." If that's the case, and it 
should be, may we let the Spruce Goose of the Reagan years rest in peace.

COOL AUTOS AND WARM DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times reported (Part I, July 18) that Assemblyman John Vasconcellos 
(D-Santa Clara) will introduce legislation to ban the sale of automotive air 
conditioners within two years. He feels such a law would force the development 
of a cooling method not dependent upon chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which harm 
the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
I have been an automotive engineer for many years, and share Vasconcellos' 
concern for the environment. While his objective is noble, I feel that an 
outright ban on air conditioners is too extreme. What is really at issue is the 
careless release of CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, when automobiles are scrapped, the air-conditioning Freon is simply 
released to the atmosphere. Last year, in correcting a manufacturing defect in 
one of its models, a Japanese car maker released more than 20 tons of Freon in 
the air, rather than purchasing available recovery equipment. 
</P>
<P>
With laws to penalize irresponsible release of CFCs, air conditioners can 
continue to serve their intended purpose without harm to the ozone layer.

STEALTH BOMBER CONTROVERSY

<P>
The Times has shown a lowly bias against the Stealth bomber. Conrad's cartoon 
on July 21 is the latest case in point. The cartoon degrades the superb 
technological achievement of the B-2 by comparing it with the hokey Batman. 
</P>
<P>
The text of Conrad's cartoon slammed the cost of the B-2. 
</P>
<P>
Why does The Times insist on showing the B-2 expense as a negative? Surely The 
Times knows that most of this expense will provide income for thousands of its 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
One would think if The Times feels it has to take a biased position it would be 
in favor of building the B-2 according to the original production plan, if not 
because the B-2 will provide a powerful defensive weapon then because it will 
assure the continued flow of aerospace/defense dollars to the benefit of 
Southern California citizens.

LET THE FORCES OF RELIGION EXPEL TERRORISTS

Today, the leaders of Hezbollah have every reason to claim victory in their 
latest encounter with the West. This, despite the fact that the radical Muslim 
fundamentalist organization has been forced to seek ways to limit the damage to 
the movement brought about by Israel's abduction of Hezbollah's spiritual and 
military mastermind, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid. 
</P>
<P>
They celebrate as surely as civilized people mourn the brutal murder of Marine 
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. They celebrate the confluence of opinion of 
European leaders, some media pundits and self-proclaimed terrorism experts who 
have conveniently placed the blame for the murder and plight of Western 
hostages squarely on Israel's shoulders. They surely revel at the videotapes 
showing Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole lambasting Israel for recklessly 
"free-lancing" the Obeid operation without apparent consideration for its chief 
ally, the United States. And Hezbollah's patrons in Iran and Syria must take 
special satisfaction at the spectacle of President Bush's statements, so 
carefully crafted to distance his Administration from the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Let us be unmistakably clear: The actions and ideology of Obeid mean to impact 
far beyond the confines of the current Arab-Israel conflict. He said it best 
himself: "We're not worried about Lebanon . . . Hezbollah doesn't believe in 
Lebanon; it doesn't recognize borders . . . What Hezbollah wants is a world 
Islamic republic. What we're trying to do now is convert the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
It is the civilized world itself that is being held hostage in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called war against terrorism has been virtually ground to a halt. We 
know it, and so do the terrorists. The most powerful offices in the world have 
seen their role in this "war" reduced to little more than writing condolence 
letters to the next of kin and public bemoaning of the difficulties of pursuing 
the elusive enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The current operative "rule of engagement" is to never put the lives of Western 
hostages at risk. In reality, our leaders have opted to heed the counsel of 
some prominent former hostages. In simple language, this means no war shall be 
waged on terrorists unless and until all innocents are out of danger! An 
admirable approach, perhaps, but one that clearly plays right into the hands of 
terrorist groups that, by their nature, will always hold hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, recent history has proven that an anti-terrorist policy based on 
rhetoric rather than action merely ensures repeat performances by terrorists on 
the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
Have all but the bereaved families of the victims forgotten the pledge of the 
United States and Britain to bring the bombers of Pan Am flight 103 before the 
bar of justice? Officials correctly asked for time to pinpoint the identity and 
whereabouts of the international criminals. But can anyone take that commitment 
seriously in wake of the Hezbollah leader's capture? Here we have a case where 
an ally, Israel, has pinpointed the man who planned every aspect of the 
kidnaping of an American citizen. Yet not one senior U.S. official has stepped 
forward to endorse the call of Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to extradite Obeid 
for trial. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of public hypocrisy cannot be a substitute for policy. Indeed, the 
current course of action will only guarantee that there will be many more men 
and women likely to suffer the horrible fate of Col. Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
To finally stem the tide of terrorism, President Bush should immediately ask 
Congress to formally declare war against terrorist groups that have engaged in 
violence against American citizens and interests. He should encourage his 
allies to do the same. Such a declaration would give the President immediate 
power and political backbone to order surgical strikes and covert operations 
against those who mock international law and morality. 
</P>
<P>
The world cannot rely exclusively on political leaders to solve this problem 
when the murderers are speaking in the name of religion. It is time for 
religious leaders of Christianity, Islam and Judaism to speak out in one voice 
and immediately publicly renounce adherents who justify hostage-taking, 
terrorism and murder in the name of God. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are many who believe that if the Roman Catholic Church had 
excommunicated Adolf Hitler and his followers in the 1930s, the Nazi terrorist 
state might have been stopped before it dragged the whole world into the abyss. 
Recent events make it incumbent that the spiritual leaders of Islam consider 
such an option.

JAPANESE-AMERICANS: A WRONG ISN'T RIGHTED IF THE PROMISE IS BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN NISHIO, Alan Nishio is co-chair of the Southern California chapter of 
the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, Congress sought to redress one of the most egregious wrongs in our 
nation's history. This year, it seems, the market for such noble aspirations 
has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Liberties Act of 1988, signed into law by President Reagan one year 
ago this week, acknowledged that the World War II incarceration of loyal 
Americans of Japanese ancestry was motivated by "racial prejudice, wartime 
hysteria and a failure of political leadership." The legislation recognized the 
"fundamental injustice of the evacuation, relocation and internment," 
apologized "on behalf of the people of the United States," and authorized 
restitution. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were shipped off to desert 
barracks solely because of their race, about half had died when the bill was 
signed. Only those internees alive as of the date of enactment are eligible to 
receive the $20,000 compensation provided in the law. 
</P>
<P>
One year after the law's passage, not a dollar of reparations has been paid. 
Congress did not fund redress payments for 1989. No funds have been 
appropriated yet for 1990. The figure that one House committee recently 
recommended is so trivial as to recall the internment decision itself: a 
betrayal of the government's promise, and again, a failure of political 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
As deplorable as the relocation of Japanese Americans was, one can argue that 
the hysteria of war and pressure from organized racists distorted the judgment 
of our democratic institutions. There are no excuses for today's pathetic 
situation. Congress is authorized to appropriate $500 million in redress for 
1990. To compensate just those survivors over the age of 70 -- a target 
Congress set in this year's budget -- would take $350 million. The House 
Appropriations Committee has recommended $50 million. That is one-half of what 
President Bush just promised to private businesses in Poland. Compared to the 
stealth bomber and the savings-and-loan bailout, of course, it is pocket 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Liberties Act is a strong and sweeping declaration of America's 
commitment to justice. Its passage was remarkable because the 60,000 surviving 
internees are not a powerful special interest. Lawyers and lobbyists did not 
win redress. The long, grass-roots efforts of the Japanese-American community 
to confront its 40 years of sorrow and anger, and to persuade Congress to 
redress this historical outrage, yielded an extraordinary, if long-delayed, 
victory of constitutional healing. The remedial effects benefit more than the 
concentration camp survivors. The law recognizes that individual freedoms 
restrict government action even during war. Among the legislation's purposes 
are to discourage similar injustices in the future and "make more credible" 
U.S. statements of concern over other nations' human-rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as countries around the world struggle with their pasts in order to 
bring change, America's commitment to remedy this sorry chapter can increase 
credibility that has been in short supply. The question now is whether this 
commitment will be fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 was passed, more than 2,000 Japanese 
American concentration camp survivors have died. Some were veterans who, on 
returning from battle on behalf of the United States, had to visit their 
families behind barbed wire. Some were mothers who had lost sons in the war. 
All had lost their property, their freedom and their dignity. Without full 
funding of redress payments, many more will be denied their government's 
recognition of the injustice inflicted upon them. 
</P>
<P>
Our commitment to justice -- and to these survivors -- must not rise in an 
election year and fall when the debt comes due. If the grudging funding levels 
now being proposed are adopted, Congress and the Administration will have 
failed to heed the Civil Liberties Act's purposes and broken its promise.

ACROBATIC INMATE PROVES JAIL ESCAPABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials who designed the newest maximum security jail at the Peter J. 
Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic said it was virtually escape proof. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, Rodolfo Corona, a 22-year-old inmate awaiting a preliminary 
hearing on robbery and kidnaping charges, proved that the structure, known as 
the North Facility, is not the inescapable fortress that planners hoped when it 
opened in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
His escape -- the first from the facility -- also demonstrated an acrobatic 
talent not found among most other inmates, or, for that matter, among most 
mortals, jail officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Other inmates told officials after the escape that Corona, who stood 5 feet, 8 
inches tall, had the agility of a circus performer or professional gymnast. 
During recreation breaks, he would mount a set of handlebars secured 5 feet 
above the ground, balancing his body in the air by the strength of his arms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Almost a Human Fly' 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is an acrobat and a half," said Capt. John Thurman, commander of 
North Facility. "He's almost a human fly." 
</P>
<P>
Corona, who remained at large, displayed a knack for trickery long before his 
escape, said Los Angeles Police Detective Lou Gutierrez, who was in charge of 
the criminal investigation that led to Corona's arrest in Panorama City on June 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said that on at least 20 occasions, Corona robbed undocumented aliens 
living in Hollywood and the Rampart area near downtown Los Angeles of a total 
of more than $10,000. Showing a security badge and saying he was a police 
officer, Corona allegedly told the victims that they were suspected of 
narcotics trafficking and then drove them in his car to their apartments or 
houses, where he ordered them to give him jewelry and cash that he claimed 
would be used as "evidence," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he made off with their possessions while they remained locked inside 
a room, Gutierrez said. On other occasions, he used a handgun or threatened to 
turn in victims to immigration officials, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Cool' 
</P>
<P>
"He's got experience beyond his years," Gutierrez said. "He's real cool. The 
victims would say, 'God, I thought he was a policeman, just the way he acted." 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials say Corona, who was exercising with other inmates in a courtyard 
recreation area about 3:30 p.m., first climbed atop the frame of an observation 
window that extends from a 20-foot wall about eight feet from the ground. 
Guards periodically look out the window to monitor inmates in the recreation 
yard, but none were looking while Corona struggled to keep his balance on the 
sloping window ledge, Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
From his perch on the window, Corona apparently used a pin from a weightlifting 
device to pry a hole into the wire mesh that covers the courtyard, Thurman 
said. He repeatedly twisted the wire links until they broke, cutting a 
two-foot-long hole through which he escaped onto the roof, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After the escape, officials installed metal plating to replace the wire mesh, 
Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the roof, Corona walked to the north side of the facility and jumped to 
the ground. Thurman speculated that Corona may have first jumped onto an 
overhang above a loading area, then jumped another 15 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
His escape had already taken him farther than any inmate in the facility's 
history, but another, perhaps greater challenge, lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow eluding a guard who routinely patrols the grounds, Corona walked 
another 100 yards to the 20-foot-high main fence enclosing the facility. He 
scaled the one section of the fence that does not have escape-deterrent screen 
wire along the top three feet. 
</P>
<P>
Then he slipped through a loop in the razor wire, leaving behind part of his 
orange jail shirt and some blood from a cut. At that point, he had just one 
small barbed-wire fence to scale at the edge of the jail compound. Once over 
it, Corona probably headed north toward Tapia Canyon Road and freedom, Thurman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The escape is the third in less than a month from the Pitchess Honor Rancho. 
The others were from a lightly guarded minimum-security jail in the three-jail 
Pitchess compound. The other two escapees were caught July 21, one day after 
they fled. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman said he believes that Corona mapped his escape route while sitting on 
sheriff's buses that on three occasions took him from the jail to downtown Los 
Angeles for court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew what he was doing," Thurman said. "There's no doubt in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said he was not surprised that Corona tried to escape. He faced more 
than 30 years in prison if convicted on all 17 counts against him, Gutierrez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that Corona, himself an undocumented alien, may have fled 
to his native Mexico. If Corona is ever captured, Thurman joked, he secretly 
hopes that the inmate will not be returned to the North Facility: He wants 
Sunday's escape to be the only one. 
</P>
<P>
"You see in the movies where people scale walls and you say, 'that's nonsense,' 
" Thurman said. "I'm a true believer now."

PROBE FOCUSED ON SLAIN MAKER OF PORN FILMS; 
</P>
<P>
AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN LOOKING AT TIES TO ORGANIZED CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Snyder, a virtual Jack-of-all-trades in the adult-film industry before he 
was shot to death on a Northridge street this week, had been under 
investigation because of his ties to alleged organized crime figures, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities considered him a "low-level dirty movie man," Snyder, 47, 
of Woodland Hills, was a principal in several video firms during the last 
decade, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, whose roles during a 20-year career in the adult-film industry included 
distributor, producer, cameraman and film editor, was also believed to be a 
heavy cocaine user, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the 
case. Los Angeles police said Snyder had a vial of the drug in his hand when 
his body was found near a curb Tuesday night at Blackhawk Street and Wilbur 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of drugs and Snyder's ties to organized crime may have led to 
his death, said the source, who asked not to be identified. But the 
investigation is still in its early stages and no clear motive for the slaying 
has surfaced, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it is wide open," said Lt. Ron Lewis, who is in charge of the 
investigation. "There are so many facets at this point to follow. We don't know 
if it was business, personal or dope-related." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reports Not Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
Lewis declined to confirm reports of Snyder's ties to organized crime figures 
and would not say if the victim was under investigation at the time of his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Snyder was vice president of Video Cassette Recordings Inc., 
also known as VCR Inc. The firm is based in a Chatsworth warehouse and has 
produced and distributed dozens of soft-core pornographic videos since 1980. 
Robert D. Genova, president of VCR, was Snyder's partner in other video 
ventures based at the same warehouse in the 19700 block of Bahama Street, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement source said Genova is associated with an organized crime 
network believed headed by Martin Taccetta, who is purported to have links to 
Eastern mobsters involved in the distribution of adult films. 
</P>
<P>
Genova and Taccetta could not be located for comment Thursday, and a man who 
answered the phone at VCR Inc. declined to discuss the business, its alleged 
ties to organized crime or Snyder's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
VCR Inc. filed for reorganization under U.S. bankruptcy laws Aug. 11, 1988, 
according to court records. A year earlier, another Genova/Snyder company, Mark 
V Productions, also filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Records Subpoenaed 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents relating to the VCR bankruptcy, Snyder and Genova 
were under investigation by federal authorities at the time the company filed 
for reorganization. Financial records from the company and its accounting firm 
were subpoenaed by investigators, the court records said. 
</P>
<P>
"Several suppliers of VCR Inc. were apparently suspected by government agencies 
as dealing in major crime activities," according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Fred Reagan declined to comment on the investigation or whether 
it was continuing when Snyder was killed. But a source familiar with the case 
said VCR is part of the focus of an ongoing organized crime investigation. 
</P>
<P>
VCR Inc. listed more than $600,000 in debts to creditors after filing for 
reorganization. Among the listed debts was $49,500 owed to Hustler magazine. 
But attorneys for Hustler charged in court documents that the magazine was owed 
more than $500,000 and that the operators of VCR Inc. fraudulently attempted to 
hide assets from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be noted that Genova and Snyder are currently under criminal 
investigation," Hustler attorneys wrote Aug. 17, 1988, in a request to a 
federal judge for appointment of a trustee to oversee reorganization of the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reorganization Continuing 
</P>
<P>
Keith S. Dobbins, an attorney representing VCR Inc. in the bankruptcy, could 
not be reached for comment. Byron Z. Moldo, an attorney who was appointed 
trustee in the bankruptcy case, said reorganization of VCR Inc. is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has made only two or three adult films during the reorganization, 
Moldo said. Because of the drop in production, Moldo said he was forced to 
temporarily suspend Snyder as a cost-cutting measure June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't happy," Moldo said of Snyder. "We had several conversations about 
it. He didn't understand why." 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement source said that following Snyder's suspension, his drug use 
may have been seen by his killer as a weakness that could be exploited by 
investigators of organized crime's alleged ties to the adult film business. 
</P>
<P>
"If you got a guy snorting cocaine, then he is usually shooting his mouth off," 
said the source. "That's what cocaine does. The cops hear that, they come 
around, see what's going on. He becomes a danger. Loose lips sink ships. So he 
gets dumped. And the ship doesn't sink." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder was killed in what appeared to be "a classic organized crime hit" when 
he showed up for a prearranged meeting on the residential street where he did 
not live or know anyone, the source said. It was unknown whether he was using 
cocaine at the time of his death, whether he had just bought the vial 
containing a small amount of the drug or if the vial was placed in his hand by 
his killer.

CHINESE CUISINE ARRIVES BY THE WAY OF DES MOINES 
</P>

Although not quite an internationally acclaimed capital of good eating, San 
Diego can boast chefs and cooks from Paris, Brooklyn, Rome, Hong Kong, 
Florence, Tokyo, Athens, Oaxaca, New Orleans and hundreds of other large and 
middling dots on the globe. 
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the new Pei's of La Jolla, the city's roster of restaurant 
origins has expanded to include Des Moines, Iowa, where restaurateur James Pei 
has operated a Chinese restaurant since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
An employee at Pei's (pronounced pies, as in a la mode) who previously worked 
at the Des Moines establishment said that restaurant has 300 seats, enjoys 
enormous popularity and is "packed all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The question that naturally arises is, can 200,000 Des Moinesians be wrong? 
</P>
<P>
The answer would seem to be, on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of Pei's opening, word flew around the restaurant community that a 
Chinese restaurant of unusual and even extraordinary elegance had arrived to 
challenge not only other Chinese houses, but also La Jolla restaurants 
generally. And, with its marble entry, crisp linens, fresh flowers and graceful 
decor, Pei's is handsome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Exotic Touches 
</P>
<P>
Pei's menu announces that the restaurant serves "distinctive Mandarin cuisine." 
This claim aside, the employee shared the information that, in Des Moines, the 
two overwhelmingly popular dishes are garlic chicken and Mongolian beef. After 
sampling both of these over the course of three visits, the impression was 
gained that Pei's speaks Chinese with a twang more distinctively Middle 
American than Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
Both dishes were, in fact, quite good, if not exotic or particularly 
sophisticated. There was good authority to the garlic chicken, the flavor 
breathy but not overpowering, the diced chicken demurely mated with mushrooms 
and water chestnuts. The Mongolian beef, teamed not only with the usual 
scallions but also with savory chunks of onion, was succulent in the real sense 
of the word, and seemed not unlike a good steak smothered in onions. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, a sort of Sunday supper calmness characterizes much of the 
cooking, which sometimes is sedate to the point of seeming sedated. The food is 
served abundantly and with some style, but the addition of a little verve would 
make it better. 
</P>
<P>
The page of specialties that opens the menu, for example, sometimes promises 
more than it delivers. This is true with dishes designated as spicy and hot, 
which are sometimes incendiary and sometimes bland, a situation that robs the 
designation of reliability. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the "princess" prawns, described as "deep-fried large prawns 
blended with our special hot sauce." The fact of this description was a plate 
of greasy, batter-fried shrimp, served with a bowl of sweetish, sticky sauce. 
</P>
<P>
There are good dishes on the specials list, though, most notably a pair made 
with beef. The orange-flavored beef, which many local restaurants prepare with 
varying success, consisted of crisply fried shreds of meat coated with a deeply 
pungent sauce based on dried tangerine peel. The dish, called "Pei's beef," 
consisted of thin slices of very tender meat that seemed to have been lightly 
breaded in minced garlic, and the finished product had a deep, fine flavor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homemade Touch 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list amounts to a roll call of old acquaintances, some of them 
friendlier than others. There are acceptable won ton, for example, and the 
dubious but delightful crab Rangoon pastries (because they contain cream 
cheese, they seem Chinese only by virtue of their won ton skins, but they are 
delicious), as well as barbecued pork and spareribs and rather tasty teriyaki 
beef. Egg rolls had the virtue of being homemade, and were likable for the 
fresh cabbage in the filling; too many eateries these days resort to the frozen 
commercial variety, which fry up mushy and awful. Pot stickers are plump and 
juicy, but served simply with soy sauce, another example of Pei's Midwestern 
bent. Dumpling aficionados know that these tasty packages must be accompanied 
by soy sauce enlivened with gingered vinegar and chili oil. The special won 
tons billed "spicy hot" were exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen also turned in a mixed performance with the more standard entrees 
listed under meat, fowl, seafood and vegetable headings. The pork moo shu 
filling is light and savory and the pancakes tender and tasty. Snow white 
chicken is a similarly satisfying dish, a simple combination of sliced chicken 
breasts, Chinese forest mushrooms and vegetables that have great delicacy and 
are a wonderful prelude to something hot. 
</P>
<P>
The hot dishes can disappoint, however, because they often are heated with red 
pepper flakes, which rasp the throat and provide heat without flavor. Szechuan 
"black paper" peppers perform the job much more subtly and would be preferable 
in such dishes as the ma la chicken, or slivered breast meat with mushrooms, 
and in the "fish-flavored" scallops, which added water chestnuts to the 
mushroom garnish but were less fishy than flavorless. The usual sweet-sours, 
soft noodle (lo mein) dishes and fried rices round out the entree selections. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most Chinese restaurants, Pei's actually offers a wine list, and one of 
respectable length, although selections under $20 are in the minority. There 
are several light Chardonnays on the list that seem comfortable with Pei's 
cuisine.

WORKER FINDS BABY NEXT TO TRACTOR TIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction worker Elias Ortiz arrived at a Palmdale work site Thursday 
morning and discovered a newborn infant -- naked, cold, covered with blood and 
dirt but alive -- on the ground by his tractor. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boy was in good condition at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center 
Thursday, said Sgt. Ron Shreves of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The infant was about seven hours old when Ortiz found him in the vacant lot 
about 7 a.m., wrapped him in a jacket and with co-worker Rafael Godinez tended 
him until paramedics arrived, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was described as 19 inches long, weighing nearly 5 pounds and of 
indeterminate race. His umbilical cord was still attached. He was unclothed, 
and his body temperature had fallen to 78 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Otherwise Healthy 
</P>
<P>
But the infant was otherwise healthy and had been transferred from the 
emergency room to the pediatric ward by afternoon, Shreves said. Hospital 
officials refused to comment on the baby's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said he noticed the infant because he was checking his tractor for flat 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw something moving next to the tire, I thought it was a dog or something; 
you don't expect a baby," Ortiz said. "It's hard to see how people can treat 
their own flesh like that, throw away their child like an animal." 
</P>
<P>
The infant's mother apparently gave birth at or near the lot at Avenue Q-14 and 
17th Street East where the construction vehicles were parked, then abandoned 
the infant next to the tractor, sheriff's officials said. A trail of blood led 
from the lot for about a block to the 38000 block of 17th Street East, leading 
investigators to believe that the mother had walked away from the scene. 
Investigators were checking the neighborhood Thursday for information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Sought 
</P>
<P>
The mother is sought in what investigators are treating as a case of felony 
child endangerment, Shreves said. He urged the mother or anyone else who may 
know about the incident to contact authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who is in protective custody of county Department of Children's 
Services, will be placed in a foster home if no one claims him, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the construction site, Ortiz and Godinez said they were glad to hear the 
baby was alive. 
</P>
<P>
"There were rocks and dirt and blood all over his face, he was making a little 
noise kind of like he was in pain," Godinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, who both have young children of their own, grimaced as they 
speculated in Spanish and English about the worst that could have happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have run him over," Ortiz said. "It was lucky."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN DIES AFTER CAR HITS PARKED TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Palmdale woman was killed Thursday when her car drifted off the 
Antelope Valley Freeway and struck a trailer-truck parked on the shoulder, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the victim in the 12:05 a.m. accident just south of San Fernando 
Road in Newhall was not released pending notification of her family, the CHP 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was driving south on the freeway when her car swerved for an unknown 
reason, left the road and hit the rear of the parked trailer truck, the CHP 
reported. Benito Turrubirtes of Los Angeles, the truck's driver, was not 
injured. He told investigators he had parked along the side of the road because 
of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
The accident is under investigation.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLAST DAMAGES DOOR OF ATTORNEY'S HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An explosion damaged the front door of an attorney's house in Van Nuys, Los 
Angeles police reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred near midnight Wednesday at the home of Robert Klein in the 
15900 block of Haynes Street, police said. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown explosive material was used, and the force of the blast heavily 
damaged the door and shattered a window in the door, Detective Robert Muldrew 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The case is being investigated by the bomb squad and the department's Criminal 
Conspiracy Unit. Police said that there were no suspects and the explosion may 
have been a prank.

FAIR TO THE FAIR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must take exception to the negative tone of your article on the San Fernando 
Valley Fair ("Fair Directors Undaunted by Losses, Plunge in Attendance," July 
23). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the reporter's preconceived notion that the event was a "failure" got 
in the way of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
When fair officials first met with our community, they estimated no more than 
15,000 would attend the fair . . . but that no matter what, it was important to 
maintain the continuity of the fair, and "the show must go on." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that, as even the reporter states, the fair drew over 29,000 attendees 
must surely indicate success, especially when the fair ran only three days this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Our area is one of the last in the Valley where you still find farms, livestock 
and farm animals. This is an important part of our heritage, as Los Angeles 
County was once known as the most prosperous agricultural area in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
I look forward to next year's fair at Hansen Dam with more days, a carnival and 
midway and even bigger crowds. I urge your reporter to come back next year. 
Perhaps then the glass will not have been half empty, but half full.

FAIR TO THE FAIR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you very much for your coverage of the 1989 San Fernando Valley Fair! 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of my Future Farmers of America students, I also wish to express our 
deepest thanks to the members of the 51st Fair District. 
</P>
<P>
The directors made a commitment and a promise to the students that a fair would 
be held in 1989. How easy it would have been to let this year go without a fair 
with all the uncertainties and obstacles that had to be overcome. Yet, to my 
students, not having a fair would have been a financial disaster. Many of their 
large livestock bank loans would have defaulted, and the students would have 
literally "eaten" their project loans. 
</P>
<P>
To the critics of the fair, I ask how nearsighted can one be! Although 
agriculture production is rapidly disappearing from the Valley, agricultural 
sales and services, veterinary services and the nursery industry are alive and 
well in the Valley and Los Angeles. Los Angeles County is still among the top 
20 counties in the state in agricultural receipts and growing stronger due to 
the boom in the nursery and landscape industries. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest attractions at the fair was the Horticulture Exhibit, where 
not only veterans were able to display their produce, but budding 
horticulturists displayed their talents by designing and constructing landscape 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The fair was an educational bonanza to each and every visitor. It still amazes 
me the number of high school students who firmly believe that eggs, milk and 
produce come from the local supermarket, prepackaged and ready to eat. The 
bottom line is that the fair allows the opportunity to educate our youth in the 
realities of the real world.

WALK-A-THON MONEY AND SALVATION ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Young's fine letter "In Behalf of the Salvation Army" (July 20) quite 
rightly reminds readers of the loving, steadfast and effective efforts that 
"army" conducts for those in need. 
</P>
<P>
One comment however, may call for clarification. It's the rueful mention that 
the Salvation Army is not on the receiving list for sharing proceeds of the San 
Fernando Valley Board of Realtors' annual Walk-a-thon for the Valley Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
These proceeds go to the Valley Mayors' Fund for the Homeless, which selects 
those service-providers it deems appropriate to help, and decides how large a 
portion of the money raised should go to each agency. It's a heavy 
responsibility, and one of the Valley Mayors' Fund takes seriously. Most 
homeless-helping groups in the San Fernando Valley were formed in the last few 
years, to cope with this recent social phenomenon's needs. Few if any are 
soundly funded, and all spend much of their needed energies on raising funds 
just to stay open, to meet their mortgage or rent payments, their utility bills 
and payrolls, in order to keep on serving the dispossessed among us in whatever 
ways they can. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army is easily the longest established and best known of all such 
agencies, and as such, (besides being one branch of a nationwide organization), 
can expect reliable funding for its work, since the general public knows, 
admires and trusts it, with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
And so, at decision time, Valley Mayors' Fund chooses to disburse Walk-a-thon 
proceeds among those other agencies in far greater need of funds. The wonderful 
Walk-a-thon walkers and all their sponsors, whose pledged donations amount to 
the total raised, can be proud that their exertions and dollars have literally 
saved some of these service-providers from having to close their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, there is very little competing among these groups. Instead, they 
meet regularly, exchange their progress and problems, network and help each 
other however they can. And where does this Valley-wide Coalition on the 
Homeless meet? Why, at Salvation Army's Community Center! 
</P>
<P>
In wintertime, Valley Mayors' Fund collects and buys blankets for Valley people 
without any kind of shelter, and each year has turned over blankets beyond 
counting, to the Salvation Army and other groups, for direct distribution. We 
are all caring private citizens and co-workers who have become fond friends, 
toiling together toward a Valley where no one need suffer.

NOT AMUSED BY ANIMAL RIGHTS COLUMN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was Jim Quinn trying to be clever with his "Around the Valley" effort (July 5)? 
</P>
<P>
His snide attempt at belittling the animal rights movement by sneering at a 
fund-raiser attended by a group of well-off animal rights proponents succeeded 
only in demonstrating that he is limited, insensitive and, worst of all, 
ignorant. If only more of the minds so tightly closed to the serious and very 
real issue of animal rights were as easy to dismiss as that of James Quinn! As 
it is, he and The Times may be assured that no such pathetic excuse for humor 
as Quinn's unworthy, low-blow write-up will undermine the animal rights 
movement a whit.

The announcement about a fashion collection with Tammy Faye Bakker's name on it 
prompted us to call the Designer Boutique in Orlando, Fla., the one shop in the 
world that carries the label. Shop owner Ken Coppersmith told us that he and 
Bakker are friends and have been talking about this for some time. But, he 
explained, she doesn't actually design the clothes. She gives them her OK, once 
they're ready for the shop, he explained. The actual work is done by a local 
talent whose name Coppersmith will not reveal. He says the first Tammy Faye 
collection has been in his store for several weeks and includes a cloak and 
some casual outfits in pastel colors, priced from $70 to $160. "There's a 
jumpsuit on the drawing board now," he adds. Next is a cosmetics line with 
Bakker's name on it, Coppersmith says. It will replace the one that was 
discontinued when Tammy Faye's husband, Jim, resigned amid controversy from his 
post as the head of the PTL (Praise the Lord) television ministry and theme 
park.

After-Hours Shopping 
</P>
<P>
There was a tap at the door. It was 6:25 p.m., and the store was already 
closed. Valerie Seres, manager of Fred Hayman's women's department, peered 
through the glass and recognized Meryl Streep. "Are you closed?" Streep asked. 
Seres replied in the affirmative, as she opened the double French doors. The 
actress was in search of a bottle of 273, the store's signature perfume, which 
her mother had requested as a birthday gift. At the same time, Streep, who is 
in town making a movie version of Carrie Fisher's novel, "Post Cards From the 
Edge," treated herself to a bottle of spray cologne.

Smile While You Work Out

Apparently the Soviets get a kick out of aerobics. And they want everybody to 
know it. So this week at the new Mezzeplex sports complex in West Los Angeles, 
Soviet officials signed an agreement to participate in the International 
Competitive Aerobics Federation Championship in 1990. Oleg Belik, deputy head 
of international relations for the Soviet state sports department, was 
accompanied by a team of Soviet aerobicizers clad in red Reebok leotards. The 
kids did a rousing round of one-armed push-ups and leapfrogs, and then Belik 
told the audience that "Aerobics has a big future in our country, because it's 
a very optimistic and democratic sport." He referred to it as being in the 
spirit of the Soviet Union and added: "We are tired of gymnasts and acrobats 
without smiles." Then he introduced the members of his smiling team, including 
perky, blond Svetlana Rozhkova, the only TV star in the group. She brought 
"Jane Fonda's Workout" to Soviet television.

Eyewitness News

In the movie "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," leading lady Meg Ryan grows older 
and wiser. We know, because she starts wearing glasses. Her romantic interest, 
played by Billy Crystal, is smitten by the look. And so are at least 322 
moviegoers across the country. As of last week, that's the number of phone 
messages left for the woman who supplied the frames. Cheryl Shuman, owner of 
Starry Eyes in Burbank, says potential buyers cared enough to track her down 
through Castle Rock Entertainment, the film's production company. As for Ryan, 
she turned out to be as picky in person as she is in the movie. She looked at 
more than 600 frames and didn't see anything she liked until she looked at 
Shuman herself, who was wearing a pair of vintage glasses by Robert La Roche. 
Now these $195 Austrian imports, with an enameled, marble-gray temple and an 
adjustable bridge, stand a good chance of becoming the Sally Spectacles.

Penney for Your Togs

Latino teen-agers making their social debut, their Quinceanera, might want to 
take a look at a special catalogue just out from JC Penney. It's filled with 
clothes that meet the dress code at these lavish events -- voluminous white 
gowns lavished with lace for the honoree, and pastel-colored bridesmaid-style 
dresses for attendants. The catalogue is written in both Spanish and English 
and represents one of the first attempts by the industry to accommodate the 
Latino market directly, says Patricia Asip, national segment marketing manager 
for JC Penney. Items offered range from $10 for a pair of finger-less gloves to 
$100 for a lace gown.

In and Out the Door 
</P>
<P>
David Hayes tells us "a funny thing" happened to him as he was on his way out 
the door at Bullocks Wilshire earlier this week. Candy Spelling, wife of 
producer Aaron, was on her way in and up to see his fall collection. She was 
simply dressed in blue jeans, wore no makeup and was trying to look incognito, 
Hayes was told later. The ever-shy designer didn't dash back to say hello, and 
he doesn't know what she bought. If asked, he says, he would have advised her 
to get the silk-rayon ("Rayon's not a dirty word anymore.") little black dress 
with a jewel neckline and a dramatic hip drape. Why this particular dress? 
Well, for one thing, "She could wear beautiful jewelry with it."

Wondering what to buy the kids next? How about a bottle of shampoo? A slew of 
hair-care companies have introduced baby-grooming products lately, with 
no-tears guarantees. Paul Mitchell has Baby No More Tears, found in beauty 
supply stores, while Redmond Products, available in drug and grocery stores, 
offers tear-less Gramma Redmond's Aussie Natural Baby Shampoo. But the most 
exclusive and extensive of the lot is San Francisco-based William &amp; 
Clarissa's product line, sold here at I Magnin. Bubble bath, soap oil, lotion, 
powder, sunscreen, lip balm and after-bath splash are available, along with the 
shampoo. Prices are up there -- from $2.50 for the lip balm to $15.50 for a 
gift pack with 2-ounce splash, 2-ounce lotion and 2-ounce shampoo. But at least 
some parents are prepared to spring for the kiddie-luxe line. "With two-income 
families, most parents can afford good products for their children," explains 
Karen Mann, a company spokeswoman. "Because they can't spend the time they 
might like with them, they will buy them something nice instead."

CLOTHESLINES: HANDLING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM 
</P>

Question: I know that Fergie caused quite a stir last fall when a stiff wind 
blew her skirt up, revealing the royal knickers. The Duchess blushed, Prince 
Andrew was said to be furious and later I read that he wanted to know why she 
had not weighted her hems to prevent such incidents. Is that what the Princess 
of Wales uses to keep her skirts in place? Do any American designers offer 
sheer summer dresses with similar weights? -- K.R. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I took your question to London's Bruce Oldfield, who designs many of 
the clothes worn by Princess Di. Oldfield, who designed the satin jacket and 
chiffon skirt illustrated here for Her Royal Highness, said he placed lead 
weights at strategic points around the hem, usually at the seams, to prevent 
the skirt from showing too much royal leg. He says he buys nickel-size weights 
at Harrod's in London, but assumes they would be available at most American 
drapery shops because weighting draperies was their original use. I don't know 
of an American designer who uses such devices to weight skirts, but if you are 
worried about keeping your skirts down in the wind, why not follow Oldfield's 
lead and sew in your own weights?

A COMPELLING CATALOGUE OF 'SEX, LIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With enviable single-mindedness, the two handsome couples in Steven 
Soderbergh's electrifying psycho-sexual comedy occupy themselves with sex, with 
lies and with videotape, in a film of exactly that name. It's the funniest and 
saddest American movie since Jim Jarmusch landed straight in the middle of our 
consciousness, and it's possibly the most compelling. ("sex, lies and 
videotape" is at selected theaters.) 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in a therapy session, with the deceptively offhanded remark by a 
beautiful young wife (Andie MacDowell) that everything is fine in her marriage, 
except that she's, well, "kinda going through this thing where I don't want him 
to touch me," the secrets that tumble out are commonplace enough. They're the 
stuff that Dear Abby readers drink in with their morning coffee; they are also 
a catalog of upscale affliction: infidelity, obsession, jealousy, impotence, 
sexual repression and a large dollop of voyeurism. 
</P>
<P>
It's Soderbergh's elegant manner of revealing these . . . contemporary 
inconveniences, and of pushing his characters into deeper and deeper 
psychological water, that creates the film's tranquil spell. As writer, 
director and editor, his control is mesmerizing. It's also more than a little 
creepy; as though Soderbergh were drawing us, a step at a time, into a warm 
pool where intimate secrets flowed back and forth as simply as currents of 
water. Feel uneasy about what you may hear? Lie back and float, everything will 
be all right. 
</P>
<P>
Well, although this isn't Brian De Palma voyeurism or David Lynch creepiness, 
sometimes it feels as though nothing will be all right. With brilliant economy, 
Soderbergh lets us see that MacDowell's husband (Peter Gallagher) is a creep in 
a three-piece suit, that her perfect marriage is a hollow disaster and that she 
is sleepwalking to keep from knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
And that's before Gallagher's old college buddy (James Spader) arrives for a 
visit. The men make unlikely friends today. The ultimate yuppie puppy, 
Gallagher has the arrogance that comes with being a law partner at 30, and the 
sexual combativeness that's led him into a volcanic affair with an 
artist-cum-bartender (Laura San Giacomo), who happens to be his wife's younger 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
Blond and quiet-spoken, Spader is open, disingenuously inquiring, almost a '60s 
throwback -- the sort who takes pride in his lack of possessions. Although 
there is every reason to believe that he is a trust-fund bum, he has blown into 
Baton Rouge with little more than a change of clothes, a beater convertible, 
his video camera and a couple of boxes of personal videotapes. If there is 
something intense about him that puts people off-balance, there is an equal 
quality that makes them trust him. Especially women. 
</P>
<P>
He intrigues MacDowell, volunteered by her husband to help Spader find an 
apartment. It might be a classic setup, except that, as Spader explains to her 
over a delicately probing lunch, he is impotent. Or at least he can't get an 
erection in the presence of another person, which is as good as impotence. If 
this disclosure widens her lovely eyes, wait until she asks him idly what's on 
all his tapes, each with a girl's name? And to what use he puts them? 
</P>
<P>
And that is Soderbergh's setup. What is not apparent from a thumbnail 
description is the film's lacerating wit, its beautiful look and sound, and the 
bravura quality to each performance. Or the terrible vein of melancholy that 
Soderbergh touches. 
</P>
<P>
It's also worth mentioning that only one character in four (MacDowell) could be 
called sympathetic. The perfectly matched Gallagher and San Giacomo deserve one 
another, and isn't Spader's helpless voyeurism pathetic? Weird? Bizarro? 
Perhaps, but that will become the fulcrum of the story. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that "sex, lies and videotape," as well as Spader, took the 
Golden Palm at Cannes this spring, although it's sad that MacDowell's supple, 
shaded brilliance went unrewarded. This is an American movie that feels French. 
All this low-key unburdening of sexual trauma. All this talk, punctuated by all 
these bedroom gymnastics, and not a lethal weapon in sight. (Actually, not a 
lot of nudity, either, for a film as drenched in sex as this one, MPAA-rated R. 
It's Gallagher's character who is crass; his creator is discreet.) 
</P>
<P>
If "sex, lies" did not go on to crash through a pair of long-standing 
psychological barriers as definitively as it does, it would be as creepy as 
Spader appears to be, as impotently teasing and as uselessly intimate. It's 
Soderbergh's ability to push his story to its furthest limits that makes it so 
arresting. Before it burst on Cannes, "sex, lies and videotape" knocked 
filmgoers into the snowbanks at the U.S. Film Festival in Park City, Utah, 
coincidentally with a complete retrospective of John Cassavetes' career. It 
might seem that, in his own distinct way, Soderbergh is the young American 
director most clearly in the vein of the dark, deeply missed Cassavetes. Both 
men, from the very first films of their careers, have demanded that we take a 
real look at our lives behind the "Shadows," or insulated by "sex, lies and 
videotape."

A MOCK-CHINESE OPERA STAGED IN AMBITIOUS SANTA FE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA FE, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is business as usual in Santa Fe. Unusual business. 
</P>
<P>
As one drives the highway toward the most popular mirage in the local desert, 
the familiar road sign still offers helpful advice: "OPERA TRAFFIC KEEP LEFT." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the open proscenium of the opera house that masquerades as an adobe, the 
lights of Los Alamos twinkle innocently in the distance. They provide a 
naturally magical cyclorama for the unnatural acts on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The Sangre de Cristo Mountains, visible from every seat in this semi-alfresco 
theater, serenely haunt the horizon. The lowest stars in the universe -- when 
left undisturbed by clouds or rain -- serve as an otherworldly yet emphatically 
dramatic ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
One would cheerfully come back, and back, to a setting like this even if it 
meant enduring yet another automatic-pilot "Carmen" or one more 
"Boheme"-by-the-numbers. But Santa Fe doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
John Crosby's idealistic company concentrates, much of the time, on unhackneyed 
repertory. Employing essentially youthful casts and imaginative directors, 
Santa Fe tries to take opera, the most irrational of art forms, seriously as 
musical drama. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe may not always succeed. At least it tries. 
</P>
<P>
It is trying this summer with five new productions. Only two of them -- Richard 
Strauss' "Rosenkavalier" and Verdi's "Traviata" -- can be classified as 
conventional. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the unconventional, the current agenda includes the first 
professional staging in America of a long-forgotten example of perfumed Gallic 
trivia, Massenet's "Cherubin" (1905), not to mention an ambitious exhumation of 
an ultra-Baroque extravaganza, Cavalli's "La Calisto" (1651). Even more 
newsworthy, however, is the U.S. premiere of Judith Weir's "A Night at the 
Chinese Opera."(1987). 
</P>
<P>
A new-wave-chic entry from Britain, it was commissioned by the BBC and much 
praised when first performed by the Kent Opera in Cheltenham. Serving as her 
own librettist, Weir has concocted a fascinatingly complex musico-theatrical 
package that wants desperately to seem simple. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1954, raised in Scotland, trained mostly in London (briefly, in the 
States), influenced, to a degree, by the likes of Stravinsky, Britten and 
Messiaen, she has dropped an imposing calling card with this, her first 
full-scale grown-up opera. Los Angeles, incidentally, made her acquaintance in 
March, 1988, when the Monday Evening Concerts mustered the American premiere of 
"The Consolations of Scholarship," a 25-minute scena for soprano and nine 
players predicated on 13th-Century Yuan dramas. 
</P>
<P>
"A Night at the Chinese Opera," seen here Wednesday, shares a similar 
inspiration. Weir has, for some time, been preoccupied with the stark rituals 
of Asian narrative, although she filters the ancient impulses through 
distinctly modern sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In this opus, she introduces herself as a virtuoso juggler. In an hour and 40 
minutes (the timing excludes two mood-shattering intermissions), she manages to 
juxtapose farce and tragedy, realism and stylization, symbolism and fantasy, 
vaudeville and political satire, always with creative strokes that are 
extraordinarily bold, economical, swift and deft. 
</P>
<P>
The outer acts focus, with mock-Brechtian objectivity, on the plight of Chao 
Lin, an innocent canal builder oppressed by Mongolian rule in the era of Marco 
Polo. The central act, a startling opera within the opera, concentrates on the 
parodistic parallel of an actual Yuan play, "The Orphan of the Chao Family." 
</P>
<P>
Weir tells her multilayered tale in bleak Western tones cleverly ornamented 
with colorful imitation-Eastern accents. She speaks a fragile, concise, 
inventive musical language enhanced by subtle dynamic effects reliant on 
primitive harmonic constructions. 
</P>
<P>
The vocal lines, craftily stressed and supported by a percussive 
chamber-orchestra, span formal speech, expressive parlando, expanded 
declamation, agitated recitative and, occasionally, poignant lyricism. The 
composer even interpolates a caricature Italian-tenor aria for Marco Polo, who 
makes an irreverently amusing cameo appearance in the third act. 
</P>
<P>
For all its gutsy, extrovert trappings, the opera remains a fragile, 
introspective creation that seems to demand an intimate hall and a sensitive 
directorial touch. Unfortunately, Santa Fe couldn't provide the former and 
didn't provide the latter. 
</P>
<P>
The crafty words and muted emotional climaxes tended to get blurred in the wide 
open spaces. The dramatic affect tended to get blunted in the heavy-handed, 
gag-oriented staging of Robert Carsen (remembered for his ersatz-Sellars 
"Marriage of Figaro" this season in Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Ever resourceful when it comes to trendy cliches, Carsen interpolated tai-chi 
exercises for the cast before the music began, sent his protagonists into the 
auditorium in quest of false immediacy, and eventually blinded the audience 
with flashing searchlights, all for no apparent reason. Not content with such 
extra-operatic distractions, he reduced the Yuan play to a plodding burlesque 
that even dishonored the Marx Brothers allusion of the title. 
</P>
<P>
He did elicit neatly focused performances, however, from such hard-working, 
versatile singing actors as John David de Haan, Drew Minter, John Kuether, 
Philip Zawisza, Judith Christin, Kathryn Gamberoni, Douglas Perry, James 
Busterud, Joyce Castle and Anthony Laciura. Michael Levine designed witty, 
minimalist-cartoon decors, brashly lit by Craig Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps next time. . . .

Roasted by critics for its news re-creations, NBC News' "Yesterday, Today and 
Tomorrow" won its time period in its debut Wednesday night, according to 
NBC-provided estimates. Facing only reruns, "Yesterday" averaged a 12.0 
overnight rating and a 23% share of audience. ABC's "China Beach" had an 8.2 
and a 16 share, while CBS's "Wiseguy" had a 7.1 and 14% share. Each ratings 
point represents 904,000 homes. "Yesterday" has two more shows (on Aug. 23 and 
Sept. 13), after which NBC will look at the ratings and decide whether it will 
become a series, a spokesman said Thursday. ALEENE MacMINN

Pianist Van Cliburn, 55, finally has a platinum record for his album that 
became the first classical LP to sell a million copies. RCA Records Wednesday 
presented Cliburn with the award for his 1958 recording of Tchaikovsky's Piano 
Concerto No. 1, which he made with conductor Kiril Kondrashin and the RCA 
Symphony. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, sales reached 1 
million by 1961, passed 2 million in 1967 and 2.5 million in 1970. RCA would 
not disclose the number of copies that have been sold, and a company 
spokeswoman said she was uncertain why a platinum record had not been bestowed 
earlier. ALEENE MacMINN

Theatergoers who want to observe "Tradition," the opening number of "Fiddler on 
the Roof," at the Music Center should allow a few extra minutes to get to their 
seats. At least 200 patrons were left waiting in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
lobby Wednesday night when the curtain went up precisely at 8 p.m. They were 
ushered to their seats after "Tradition" had been performed. Sandra Kimberling, 
Music Center Operating Co. president, had no explanation for the unusually 
large number of latecomers Wednesday, but she noted that the show must begin 
promptly in order to avoid union charges for overtime, which begin after three 
hours. The show is timed to end at 10:59 p.m., one minute shy of the allotted 
three hours. "Fiddler" will be at the Music Center through Sunday, then moves 
to the Orange County Performing Arts Center for a week.

MORE MUSCULAR MADNESS FROM STALLONE IN 'LOCK UP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Lock Up" (citywide) is yet another Sylvester Stallone macho fantasy in which 
he plays an underdog of superhuman endurance. Once again, his ability to 
survive extreme brutality is used to justify equally savage acts of revenge. As 
experienced a rabble-rouser as Stallone is, he by now defies credibility to the 
point of inviting unintended laughter. 
</P>
<P>
As a convict at the mercy of Donald Sutherland's crazy prison warden and his 
equally sadistic goons, Stallone survives one horrific physical and 
psychological assault after another, yet emerges after each hideous session as 
smiling and relaxed as if he had spent a weekend in Palm Springs. Increasingly, 
Stallone has become the hero of live-action cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
In his own view, Stallone's Frank Leone ought never have gone to prison in the 
first place. He was only avenging his foster father, an auto mechanic, after 
the old man had been attacked by thugs with "connections" that enabled them to 
get Leone sent up. When Sutherland's hateful Warden Drumgoole refuses to allow 
Leone a deathbed visit to his foster father, he breaks out, even though his 
sentence has only two weeks to run. The incident draws Leone additional time at 
a "country club" facility, but it also generates bad publicity for the warden, 
who is transferred to the notorious old Gateway penitentiary, a vast pile with 
an immense copper Beaux Arts dome. (All this has happened before the picture 
starts -- and thus requires a heavy dose of exposition.) 
</P>
<P>
In the darkness of night, the warden somehow manages to have Leone moved to 
Gateway, where he will have six months in which to destroy the convict. The 
warden may be a man obsessed, but Stallone's writers make sure their star has 
plenty of scenes in which he can display his good-natured camaraderie with the 
nicer convicts. Consequently, "Lock Up" veers constantly between unabashed 
sentimentality and unspeakable violence, all of it underlined broadly by Bill 
Conti's score. 
</P>
<P>
As supremely silly as "Lock Up" (rated R) essentially is, it is the work of 
film makers who know exactly what they want and how to get it. Lean and tough, 
Stallone looks great, and so does this film. Although at 108 minutes it's 
overly long, it moves well under John Flynn's slam-bam, pumped-up direction. 
Much of the time Stallone is laid-back and humorous, confident enough in his 
star power to allow his supporting players showy turns: John Amos (as the 
warden's adamantine but reflective second-in-command), Sonny Landham (as a 
looming, vicious con who does the warden's bidding), Tom Sizemore (as the 
garrulous prisoner Dallas), Frank McCrae (the hulking, kindly Eclipse) and 
Larry Romano (as the doomed, 20-year-old First Base). 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland seems to have tongue firmly in cheek, and Darlanne Fluegel has 
precious few moments as Leone's rather dim-seeming fiancee. (Why doesn't she 
get the press to investigate Leone's transfer, for example?). As for Stallone, 
he's overdue in stretching his talent, not just his muscles. KEVIN THOMAS

DELICATE CULTURAL FLAVOR IN 'BOWL OF TEA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Wang gets shadows and a honey-soft glow into the images of his fine new 
film "Eat a Bowl of Tea" (Music Hall). Pinned down in darkness, the flesh tones 
gleam like peach-skin pearls. Like his last movie, the vacuous but gaudily shot 
thriller "Slamdance," "Tea" resembles a sort of film noir under glass. But it's 
a delicate, rummy little film noir that doesn't heave murder and cliches at us. 
The melodramatic plot points are buried within a naturalistic, nostalgic story, 
set in an era and place -- the late '40s in New York's Chinatown -- that begins 
to seem stylized as a Czech puppet film. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Louis Chu's 1961 novel, "Tea" is about a young Chinatown couple 
pressured so outrageously to produce children that, finally, they can't even 
make love. This is no smutty joke. The Exclusion Laws, in effect for 60 years 
until they were repealed in the mid-'40s, had banned women and new immigrants 
from entering the country. Chinatown, in the late '40s, was a community of 
aging virtual bachelors. 
</P>
<P>
So, swarming around the movie's young couple -- Army vet Wang Ben Loy (Russell 
Wong) and his immigrant bride Mei Oi (Cora Miao, the wife of director Wang) -- 
are an enclave of grinning old voyeurs who can barely contain their lascivious 
curiosity. Deprived of marital sex and family, they turn the wedding pair into 
both heroes and butts. Worst of all is Ben Loy's father, Wang Wah Gay (Victor 
Wong), who's seen his prestige rise as a result of the marriage and fears it 
will topple if they can't produce. The joker in this randy deck is a wily, 
chubby Lothario named Ah Song, played with beaming panache by Hong Kong comedy 
star Eric Tsang Chi Wai. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, in turn, are drowned in romantic fantasy: the plush, moonstruck 
images they've flushed out of movies and pop songs. Wang stages the action 
against creamy '40s pop ballads -- a Chinese chanteuse, languorously crooning 
"Slow Boat to China" -- scat songs and standards. And he surrounds his lovers 
with great lustrous images out of movies. When Ben Loy woos Mei Oi in her 
village, they're before a huge screen showing Capra's "Lost Horizon." Later on, 
the couple get hot with Orson and Rita in Welles' "Lady From Shanghai," and, 
still later, the romanticism has shriveled to pint-size: a scene from Cukor's 
"Holiday" on a tiny TV, which they all but ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Wang's major subject is the fusion of Chinese and American cultures. In "Eat a 
Bowl of Tea" -- a vernacular phrase that roughly means "Take your medicine" -- 
he's again examining it with irony and affection. One of his funniest insights 
is in the way he replaces cliched images of smiling, remote, somewhat sinister 
Sino-Americans with earthy and pragmatic urban wise guys, more realistic 
cousins of the slangy, extroverted hipsters Keye Luke played in the '40s. 
Indeed, one flaw in the film may be that Mei Oi is too Americanized, acclimated 
too rapidly. This Chinese girl, fresh from the countryside, in the end, cops 
attitudes that seem more compatible with post-'70s liberation. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters are good but sometimes facile. The oldsters around them shine. 
As Wah Gay, Wong gives another eccentric and endearing comic performance. He is 
a great oddball camera subject: His face looks like a withered fruit split down 
the middle and pasted back together slightly askew, with a crooked, slithery 
grin and the eyes popping frenziedly in either direction. His character here 
isn't like the warmhearted "uncle" he played in Wang's "Dim Sum." This is a 
warm-hearted, patriarchal nut-case and Wong acts him with the unabashed comic 
fervor of Charley Grapewin's Grampaw Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Rascoe's screenplay is so briskly compressed, the movie feels almost 
distilled. Shot in Hong Kong, in sets that are like a dollhouse vision, the 
characters are seen flailing around in their little rituals of love, cultural 
adjustment, betrayal, shame and violence, just as trapped in the plot as they 
are in conventions and culture. But there's nothing stifling or ragged about 
the imagery in "Eat a Bowl of Tea" (MPAA-rated PG-13, despite sexual content). 
It's like a photo album with the pages being precisely turned, one after the 
other. That's the key to the movie: a mixture of love and sarcasm. Like those 
medicinal herb teas, it's steeped in bitterness and warmth, soaked in tradition 
and life. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

'KNICKKNACK': GIMMICK WORTH WAITING FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Knickknack," the latest film from Pixar's award-winning computer animation 
team of John Lasseter, William Reeves and Eben Ostby, made its belated debut in 
"The Second Animation Celebration: The Movie!" earlier this week at selected 
theaters. It was worth waiting for: "Knickknack" is even better than "Luxo Jr." 
and the Oscar-winning "Tin Toy." 
</P>
<P>
The film centers on the little snowman inside one of those tacky souvenir 
paperweights filled with plastic snow. His elaborate but unsuccessful attempts 
to escape from his tiny prison are reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote's baroque 
schemes. The slightly artificial movements of computer animation are well 
suited to these plastic characters. There are no distorted humans, like the 
monstrous baby in "Tin Toy," and the swirling snow inside the paperweight would 
be a nightmare to animate by hand. 
</P>
<P>
A sure crowd-pleader, "Knickknack" may well earn Pixar its third Oscar 
nomination.CHARLES SOLOMON

THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Drawings have always been the closest link to the working process of an 
artist's mind. Small, portable and made with relatively cheap materials, they 
traditionally have served as a means of "thinking out loud" about images and 
issues. But the rise of conceptual art has made the activity of drawing seem 
less private and preliminary. Today, a drawing is often simply an alternative 
method of making finished art. 
</P>
<P>
A stunning exhibit of 117 drawings by 112 different hands, "A Decade of 
American Drawing 1980-1989," includes work by just about every major artist 
working in two-dimensional media in the United States as well as many 
lesser-known names. What the show doesn't include, unfortunately, is a 
catalogue with an essay to put all this work into some sort of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Drawing" in this show embraces not only pencil, ink, or charcoal on paper but 
a host of other materials as bizarre -- in this context -- as fabric paint on 
flannel (Robert Gober's "Untitled -- Sleepers"). Richmond Burton paints elegant 
arrangements of lines on canvas and mounts them on paper in "Brooklyn Bridge." 
In "Triangle," Barbara Bloom scribbles triangles and equations (perhaps 
relating to the Greek "golden mean") on the mat surrounding a photograph of 
people looking at antique sculpture in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, the familiar artists offer few surprises; rather, their drawings 
encapsulate in miniature -- or, considering the substantial size of some of 
these works -- in humbler materials, the kind of work for which they are 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
Given the absence of dates of similar works in other media by the show's 
artists, however (here's where that essay would come in handy), it's impossible 
to know when -- in the development of an artist's particular line of thought -- 
a drawing came into being. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been intended to greet the world as a drawing -- regardless of the 
continuing dominance of painting in the hierarchy of art media. But it might 
have been a dry run for a series of similar works on canvas or a method of 
plotting out an installation. Or it might have been an afterthought, a pause to 
reflect before moving on to other themes. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, few of the works on view actually suggest the process of 
thinking out a problem. (The exceptions include James Rosenquist's "Study for 
Skull Snap," an image of a skull with an attached dripping spigot and 
mousetrap, Brice Marden's knotted, rhythmic "Cold Mountain Study" and Susan 
Rothenberg's hauntingly ambiguous untitled drawing of a hand and peculiarly 
shaped foot supported by long bamboo splints.) 
</P>
<P>
The sampling of realist imagery in the exhibit includes nudes by Alfred Leslie 
and Eric Fischl and portraits by William Bailey, David Hockney, David Salle, 
Robert Longo, Alice Neel, Malcolm Morley, Wayne Thiebaud and Larry Rivers. 
Their rationales and working methods, of course, vary wildly. One looks at the 
Salle, for example -- an untitled charcoal drawing of a topless young woman 
pinching her underarm -- and tries to imagine the source from which it was 
probably copied. 
</P>
<P>
The abstract entries -- by Sean Scully, Agnes Martin, Bill Jensen, Ellsworth 
Kelly, Alan Saret, Elizabeth Murray and a few others -- are relatively few. But 
their ranks do include such unexpected delights as John Chamberlain's tiny 
"Howling Excess," a squirming mass of gold, silver, purple and orange squiggles 
and Cy Twombly's "Untitled (Proteus)," a jagged gasp of irregular strokes of 
oil stick that seems to metamorphose (like the Greek sea god) from vegetable to 
animal form. 
</P>
<P>
Yet (although a roll call of names may not bear this out) conceptual work in 
its various guises gives the show its most pronounced flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Halley's road sign words ("Maintain Speed," "Road Ends") cut out of 
pieces of Kodalith, Richard Prince's pairings of New Yorker-style cartoons with 
John Cheever-style anecdotes, John Baldessari's fragmentary images sketched on 
plastic for the 1984 Summer Olympics poster -- these and other works at once 
confound and enlarge one's notion of what a drawing can be. (Daniel Weinberg 
Gallery, 619 and 625 N. Almont Drive, to Aug. 26.) CATHY CURTIS

New York's Museum of Modern Art Thursday placed on view Vincent Van Gogh's 
"Portrait of Joseph Roulin," which it recently acquired from a private Swiss 
collection. The painting, the fourth of a series of portraits of the postmaster 
of Arles, France, was completed early in 1889, a year before Van Gogh's death, 
and is considered one of the expressionist's finest works from the French 
countryside. ALEENE MacMINN

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: RECOMMENDATION FOR EL TORITO GRILL -- WITH RESERVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You should probably know that although they will gladly take your reservation 
when you call, and although the sign at the desk loudly proclaims "reservations 
taken," they do not really take reservations at the new El Torito Grill, 9595 
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, (213) 550-1599. What they do is put you at the 
head of the waiting list when you arrive. And although the restaurant has been 
open barely a week, is the size of a small airport and is densely filled with 
tables, that list is bound to be sizable by the time you get there. Already the 
place is packed. 
</P>
<P>
When you finally get a table you will discover that it is in a room so loud 
that you won't be able to hear the baby at the next table crying. Once the 
waiter has brought exotic drinks like Pink Cadillac Margaritas and mixed 
guacamole at your table, you may not care. So you'll go on to various 
combinations of tacos, taquitos, enchiladas and the like (all very reasonably 
priced), or a rather ornate series of Southwestern specials. "It's a Hasidic 
quesadilla," a man at one table was saying as we passed, contemplating a 
concoction filled with smoked salmon, jicama, apples and toasted pinenuts with 
cilantro and green chile pesto. 
</P>
<P>
As for dessert -- are you ready for banana-filled chocolate enchiladas? RUTH

MALIBU SET NOW HAS LA SCALA-BY-THE-CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Discreet, very discreet. Maybe the new La Scala is a little self-conscious 
about being in a shopping center, though a shopping center in Malibu is not 
just a shopping center. Anyway, there's nothing on the street to give it away. 
Even in the parking lot there is only a discreet wrought-iron sign between two 
shops indicating the path to the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But I can trust you with the secret. It's around the back, behind the Wells 
Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
The original La Scala in Beverly Hills is known for attracting Beautiful 
People. Malibu people are just as Beautiful, only more casual. Something about 
La Scala Malibu's spaciousness and comfortable booths and the odd homeyness of 
having mismatched table lamps along with miniature orange trees really seems to 
agree with people around here. The place is always packed for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is even more casual, almost beachy. Around the margin of the lunch menu 
are reminders that they serve beer, wine, coffee and milk, and the dessert 
tirami su is helpfully spelled out ti-ra-mi-su. However, lunch is also the 
prettiest time to eat, when you have a view of the tree-lined bed of Malibu 
Creek. As somebody pointed out, it should be a particularly interesting view 
next time the creek floods. (La Scala does look water-tight.) 
</P>
<P>
The food certainly attracts people in its own right: genuine Westside Italian 
stuff like carpaccio and penne arrabbiate way out here in Malibu. It's marked 
by a curious schizophrenia, though. Some appetizers are of the exquisite, 
infinitesimal sort where you can estimate the price of each mouthful in the $2 
range. For instance, the remarkably good smoked salmon in truffle sauce (an 
almost undetectably discreet sauce). 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some items come in very generous portions, like the calamari 
salad stacked high with calamari, tomatoes and two colors of olives, all in a 
very garlicky dressing. And the bean soup is a meal: a big bowl of stewed white 
beans with some salt pork and virgin olive oil for flavoring. 
</P>
<P>
The trademark of the menu on the entree side is a fascination with eggplant. 
There are two pasta dishes with eggplant, one an interesting tortelloni stuffed 
with eggplant and cheese in cream sauce (the eggplant tastes a little sweet and 
rather like some kind of squash). The other is rigatoni Malibu, where a cream 
sauce colored with tomato and dosed with Parmesan includes little well-cooked 
pieces of eggplant, which here taste almost meaty. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, you can almost feel you're back in Beverly Hills. Tagliatelle with 
ham and peas, including mushrooms and nice sweet onions. Swordfish marinated in 
herbs and grilled. Roast chicken marinated in rosemary and garlic, the skin 
nice and brown. And at the end, rather cakey zuppa inglese with a thick whipped 
cream layer, and very good chocolate mousse, dense and a little bitter, very 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
 La Scala Malibu, 3874 Cross Creek Road, Malibu; (213) 456-1979. Open for lunch 
Monday through Friday, for dinner daily. Full bar. Parking lot. American 
Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $50-$90.

'THE NERD,' AND 'EVITA' AT PCPA THEATERFEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOLVANG, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual Theaterfest of the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts is in 
the middle of one of its more modest seasons. Three of its six shows have been 
seen before at PCPA, and two of the others have been seen often in Southern 
California, though not at PCPA. 
</P>
<P>
However, in its sixth slot, the Theaterfest is introducing Larry Shue's "The 
Nerd" to, well, northern Southern California (it was seen last year at the 
Gaslamp Quarter Theatre in San Diego). This production is particularly 
noteworthy for hiring James Pickering -- who portrayed "The Nerd" at Milwaukee 
Repertory Theatre in 1981 in the first full-length production of any of Shue's 
plays -- to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's Shue season right now. The West Coast premiere of the late 
writer's final play, "Wenceslas Square," occurred Saturday at the Matrix in Los 
Angeles. If "Wenceslas Square" was Shue's most serious effort, then "The Nerd" 
was surely his most frivolous. His most famous play, a strained farce called 
"The Foreigner," is relatively profound compared to "The Nerd." 
</P>
<P>
We're in the Terre Haute home of architect Willum Cubbert (Frederic Barbour), 
who's down in the dumps on his 34th birthday. Suddenly, his life is interrupted 
by the unexpected arrival of someone even dumpier, Rick Steadman (Pickering). 
Though Willum has never seen Rick, he believes that he owes Rick his life. It 
was Rick who carried the unconscious Willum to safety after he was wounded in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion is not what Willum had in mind. Rick is thoroughly unlikable -- and 
not only from the cosmetic perspective that inspired the title of the play. 
Rick attempts to dominate every conversation with heedless remarks and inane 
games, he moves into Willum's home without an invitation, he spoils Willum's 
work. After one of Willum's clients walks out in disgust, Rick even has the 
gall to run after the client, offering his own pipe-dream architectural talents 
in place of Willum's real ones. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sophomoric quality of many of the jokes, the play perks along for a 
while on the basis of some strong comic set-ups and our expectation that Shue 
will take us deeper than it appears at first glance. Surely he's gradually 
making a statement about co-dependency, or else he'll show us the kernel of 
humanity underneath the unkempt facade of the title character, or else it's all 
a metaphor for Vietnam -- or something. Anything. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but no. The play gets sillier, more manipulative, and less credible as 
it goes on. It features one of those annoying endings in which the rules 
suddenly change -- for no worthwhile reason. It leaves the impression that 
we're supposed to chuckle tolerantly over behavior that's really quite 
reprehensible, when you think about it. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering is a no-holds-barred nerd, ungainly in voice as well as posture, 
never for a moment begging for sympathy. It's Willum who's supposed to be the 
audience surrogate -- yet Barbour is too bland and detached for the task. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Dignon's performance as Willum's chum, a cynical drama critic, is loud, if 
nothing else. In the outdoor amphitheater in Solvang, he shouted his sour 
wisecracks as if the entire audience were hard of hearing. Maybe he tones it 
down for the indoor performances in Santa Maria. James Pickering's wife Rose 
Pickering plays the wife of Willum's client with comic panache; she, too, 
re-creates her role from the original production. 
</P>
<P>
Theaterfest managing artistic director Jack Shouse has selected "Evita" as his 
personally staged production this summer, and it's a dynamic piece of work. It 
proves that it wasn't just Harold Prince's blistering proscenium staging that 
made "Evita" such a show. 
</P>
<P>
Here, on a thrust stage, "Evita" still blazes. Perhaps composer Andrew Lloyd 
Webber, if not lyricist Tim Rice, deserves more credit than we realized when 
"Evita" first emerged a decade ago (the American premiere was at the Music 
Center, part of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera season -- another indication 
of how far that organization has fallen). 
</P>
<P>
The only problem with this production is the vocal range of Christina Munoz in 
the title role -- she's light in the upper registers, and some of her words up 
there are garbled. But she acts the transitions in the character with ease. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the cast is in Actors' Equity, so it really isn't a professional 
production, but you'd never know it from looking at it. Sam Fontana is a short, 
cocky Che, and Steve Irish's Peron is a big, cold fish with a beautiful voice. 
</P>
<P>
There are no filmed projections in Shouse's staging. But the angles of the 
thrust stage create their own drama in conjunction with Michael Barnard's 
dances and Michael A. Peterson's lighting. Brad Carroll is the musical 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The Theaterfest is at the Festival Theatre, 420 2nd St., Solvang, and the 
Marian Theatre at Allan Hancock College, 800 S. College Drive, Santa Maria. 
</P>

DRUG IS FOUND TO DELAY PROGRESSION OF PARKINSON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have demonstrated for the first time that a drug treatment can delay 
the brain-destroying progression of Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
In a California trial involving 54 patients, the drug, called deprenyl, nearly 
doubled the time that elapsed between the onset of Parkinson's and the need for 
therapy with the most commonly used drug, L-dopa, researchers from the 
California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose report in today's issue of the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
L-dopa does not slow the normally fatal disease, which usually strikes people 
over the age of 50, but it does alleviate its symptoms, which include disabling 
tremors and rigidity of the limbs and, in at least 30% of the cases, mental 
impairment. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with earlier anecdotal reports suggesting that deprenyl prolongs the 
lives of Parkinson's victims, the research suggests that powerful relief will 
soon be available for Parkinson's victims, who number over 1 million in the 
United States alone. Deprenyl is scheduled to be marketed as a prescription 
drug next month. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery has implications even beyond that. Two other conditions 
associated with aging, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(Lou Gehrig's disease), also involve inexorable degeneration of brain cells, 
and physicians have not been able to slow their progression either. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that disease progression has been slowed in Parkinson's "raises the 
hope that you can do it with the others as well," said neurologist J. William 
Langston, the principal investigator of the new study. 
</P>
<P>
The new results are "very important," said neurologist Stanley Fahn of the 
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, co-chairman of a larger 
study of deprenyl -- called DATATOP -- that is now under way at 28 clinical 
centers throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's study served as a pilot program for DATATOP. Results from the larger 
study are not expected until late 1990 at the earliest, and Fahn refused to 
comment on them. But rumors circulating in the neurological community suggest 
that those results will support Langston's findings. 
</P>
<P>
And Langston's results could have an immediate impact on treatment of 
Parkinson's in this country. Six weeks ago, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approved marketing of deprenyl for use in combination with 
L-dopa for treating patients late in the course of Parkinson's. Somerset 
Pharmaceuticals of Denville, N.J., will begin marketing the drug as Eldepryl in 
mid-September, and once they do, physicians -- as they may with any drug -- 
will be free to prescribe it for any use they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
Fahn noted that it is "inevitable" that large numbers of neurologists will 
"jump on it (deprenyl)" for their patients in the early stages of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease results from the death of cells in the substantia nigra 
portion of the brain that secrete the neural transmitter dopamine, which plays 
a key role in the control of muscle movement. The disease's cause is unknown, 
but growing numbers of neurologists believe that it is produced by chemicals in 
the environment that poison the dopamine-secreting cells. 
</P>
<P>
As production of dopamine is slowed, the victims lose control of their limbs 
until they eventually become completely disabled. L-dopa is used in therapy 
because it is converted into dopamine in the brain, increasing the brain's 
dopamine supply. But it is effective, on average, for only about six years, 
after which symptoms worsen. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers have attempted to cure Parkinson's by transplanting 
dopamine-secreting cells from the adrenal glands or from fetuses into the 
brains of victims. But those procedures have been attempted on only about 300 
patients and there is still no consensus on their value. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, deprenyl could be used with virtually every Parkinson's patient. 
</P>
<P>
For their study, Langston and neurologist James W. Tetrud recruited 54 patients 
who had recently been found to have Parkinson's disease. Half were given 
twice-daily doses of deprenyl and half were given a placebo -- a sugar pill 
with no effect. The patients were monitored until either they had been in the 
study for three years or their condition became severe enough to require 
L-dopa. 
</P>
<P>
They found that the average time before L-dopa was required was 312 days in the 
placebo group and 549 days in the deprenyl group. 
</P>
<P>
Langston and Tetrud also rated the patients' neurological condition on five 
separate scales. They found that, based on these scales, disease progression 
was slowed by 40% to 83% per year. 
</P>
<P>
"The clinical observations suggest that the disease is progressing more slowly 
. . . and that's compelling evidence, but it is not proof," Langston said in an 
interview. "To prove it, we would have to demonstrate that nerve cells are 
surviving over time, (a procedure) that is not currently possible in living 
humans." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the study, the patients were taken off deprenyl for a month to 
ensure that the apparent slowdown in disease progression was due to the 
preservation of nerve cells and not simply to relief of symptoms. The drug 
therapy was then restarted and the researchers will continue to monitor the 
patients to determine whether the drug continues its effects for longer 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, deprenyl has been used in Europe for about 15 years to treat 
patients who have begun to develop tolerance for the effects of L-dopa. In one 
key study, pharmacologist Moussa B.H. Youdim of the Technion-Israel Institute 
of Technology found that combined use of L-dopa and deprenyl substantially 
increased the survival of Parkinson's victims. 
</P>
<P>
But that study was viewed with "a great deal of skepticism," according to UCLA 
neurologist Charles H. Markham, because it was an uncontrolled study on an 
unusual group of Parkinson's patients. Langston's results, however, would seem 
to provide strong support for Youdim's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million DATATOP study has a design similar to Langston and Tetrud's but 
involves 800 patients. Some of those patients are also receiving Vitamin E as 
well as deprenyl, however, to determine whether Vitamin E can also slow the 
disease, as animal experiments have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
If the DATATOP results confirm Langston and Tetrud's, Fahn said, researchers 
will almost certainly begin studying the long-term combined effects of L-dopa 
and deprenyl to determine if people will in fact live longer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PARKINSON'S DRUG 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease is caused by the death of cells in the substantia nigra at 
the base of the brain that release a hormone necessary for controlling muscle 
movements. Mounting evidence indicates that metabolites of environmental 
chemicals, such as pesticides, can kill the cells, causing the disease. The 
drug deprenyl delays the progression of Parkinson's by blocking conversion of 
the chemicals into their toxic form.

<P>
OPTIONS FADING FAST FOR L.A. COUNTY BURN VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-year-old boy was taken to a downtown Los Angeles hospital several weeks ago 
after a street vendor's cart tipped over, drenching him with boiling water. The 
burns on his chest, genitals and hands were so severe he needed to be 
transferred immediately to a burn center for skin grafts and other special 
care. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no beds available in any of Los Angeles County's three burn 
centers. Or in Orange County. Or at the UC San Diego burn unit in Hillcrest, 
the only burn unit in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Seven hours after the accident, a burn center in Fresno finally agreed to take 
him, said Dr. Cheryl Lee, an emergency physician at White Memorial Medical 
Center who arranged the transfer. A helicopter finally whisked the boy away, 
leaving his parents behind because there was no room for them on board. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County's three burn centers have a total of 12 intensive-care beds 
that are currently staffed, down from 34 two years ago, according to a tally by 
officials at the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, all these beds are occupied, forcing local burn victims to be 
flown to other counties or even out of the state for care. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a lot of calls from major institutions in Los Angeles to transfer 
very major burn cases," said Dr. Steve Zumiga at Valley Medical Center's burn 
unit in Fresno. "I find it unbelievable that the hospitals there can't handle 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William D. Davies, founder of the burn center at Torrance Memorial Medical 
Center, said, "It's a daily occurrence that people here in Los Angeles have 
trouble getting placed in a burn center in this county." 
</P>
<P>
Burn centers throughout the country are in financial trouble, mainly because 
the patients they treat tend to be poor and often lack health insurance. At the 
same time, medical advances have enabled doctors to save patients that only 10 
years ago would have had no chance of survival -- but such highly specialized 
treatment is costly. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is especially acute in Los Angeles County, where the number of 
uninsured residents -- many newly arrived immigrants -- is growing fast and 
public funding for mental health, trauma care and other health services has 
been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Torrance Totters 
</P>
<P>
In what threatens to make a bad situation even worse, officials at Torrance 
Memorial, a nonprofit community hospital, are considering closing their burn 
unit because of financial losses from treating burn victims who do not have 
health insurance or who have inadequate coverage. These patients, hospital 
officials said, have put the five-bed burn unit in the red, costing the 
hospital about $200,000 during the first five months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, another private hospital, Brotman Medical Center, closed its 
Michael Jackson Burn Center in Culver City because of financial problems. And 
this year, County-USC Medical Center, which is Los Angeles County's only public 
resource for indigent burn patients, drastically reduced service. Three of its 
seven intensive-care burn beds were eliminated, due largely to the 
unavailability of nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, patients burned in car accidents, household injuries, assaults, 
or on the job cannot get a bed in a local burn center. 
</P>
<P>
One family involved in a fiery traffic accident was split up when the husband 
was sent to County-USC for care, the wife was sent to Las Vegas and their 
4-year old child was sent to San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that an awful way to have to deal with the biggest tragedy in a family's 
life?" said Audrey Bahr, chief of the contract program office of the Los 
Angeles County Department of Health Services. "How would you like to be a 
grandmother trying to figure out who to visit?" 
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, county health officials said there 
was no room at local burn centers for 13% of the patients seeking care there. 
They had to be treated either at non-burn centers or at hospitals outside Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals routinely treat burns, but only specially equipped burn centers are 
capable of performing the delicate skin grafts and plastic surgery required in 
the most severe cases. In Los Angeles County, it can take as long as 10 hours 
and require phone calls to more than six hospitals before a patient is placed, 
according to county health emergency care official Darlene Isbell. 
</P>
<P>
Because so many of the patients needing to be transferred out of Los Angeles 
have little or no medical insurance coverage, the UC Irvine Medical Center burn 
unit will not take them, said Bahr. "We have trouble getting San Diego to take 
them, too." 
</P>
<P>
"We have received an increasing number of calls from Los Angeles," said Dr. 
John Hansbrough, medical director of the UCSD burn unit. "But we have never had 
to turn away a funded patient" when an out-of-county hospital has requested a 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's unit, which includes six intensive-care unit beds and eight special care 
beds, has been able to meet the demand generated by San Diego County, according 
to hospital spokeswoman Sheri Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The worst burn cases end up in the ICU beds. Less-severe burn cases and 
patients who are recovering are treated in the special care beds, Smith said. 
The burn unit on occasion has been used to handle other types of seriously 
injured patients, especially when the UCSD hospital is swamped by trauma 
patients, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Davies recalled a recent accident in which two children were burned over half 
their bodies when a pickup truck and car collided. 
</P>
<P>
"One kid had insurance," Davies said, and he was accepted at the Southern 
California Burn Center, a private facility at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, 
the county's third operating burn center with three beds. "The other kid had 
none, and nobody (at any Los Angeles burn center) was able to take care of 
him." Eventually, a bed was found for him at San Bernardino County Medical 
Center's burn unit, Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr said that over the July 4 weekend, four burn patients were transferred out 
of Los Angeles County, including a 5-month-old infant burned in a crib fire and 
a 29-year-old man who tried to swallow a firecracker while high on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Airlifting burn victims is not medically unsound in most circumstances, doctors 
say. For example, the Army for years has transported burned servicemen to 
specialized centers thousands of miles away. And in many rural areas of the 
country and small cities, patients are commonly helicoptered to regional burn 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
But it is preferable to avoid helicopter trips. They're not only expensive, but 
separate patients from their families and friends whose support is usually 
vital to their recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I grieve the most for the indigent child," who gets shuttled 
around without his parents, said Davies at Torrance Memorial. He pointed out 
that a 5-year-old girl from Los Angeles, now under his care, was sent to San 
Francisco for initial burn treatment because there were no beds available in 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a crime that a county like Los Angeles" has so few intensive-care burn 
beds that patients have to be sent as far away as Dallas for treatment, said 
David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Los Angeles, other major metropolitan areas usually have enough beds to 
accommodate their burn victims. 
</P>
<P>
"New York City seems to be pretty well served by the available burn beds," said 
Dr. Cleon W. Goodwin, director of the burn center at New York Hospital-Cornell 
University Medical Center in Manhattan. Rather than flying patients out of town 
for care, he said patients are often flown into New York for treatment at one 
of the three burn centers. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, the city's single burn center at Jackson Memorial Hospital is big 
enough to accommodate the vast majority of Dade County's burn victims, said Dr. 
Charles G. Ward, director of the hospital's burn center and immediate past 
president of the American Burn Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Is Money 
</P>
<P>
Despite financial strains, the nationwide network of about 120 burn centers 
that sprung up during the late 1960s and early '70s is not collapsing, 
according to Ward. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has the same problem -- funding," he said. "But we haven't seen any 
collapse yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Most burn centers . . . are aware that you aren't going to balance the books 
by taking care of burn patients. . . . They continue the care as part of their 
obligation to serve the community," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the country's biggest burn centers, especially in large urban areas, 
are located in teaching institutions or public hospitals where patient care is 
subsidized. In Miami and New York City, for example, all the critical burn care 
is provided by such institutions. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, the burn center at County-USC has lost beds as the number 
of patients seeking care there has grown. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving backwards," said Dr. Bruce Zawocki, director of the County-USC 
burn center, which is plagued by a shortage of critical-care nurses. "My fear 
is that we're turning back the clock about 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials estimate a 75% yearly turnover of nurses at County-USC. 
Without nurses, the unit's critical-care beds cannot be filled. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, County-USC concentrates on providing care for the county's poorest 
burn victims, allowing the county's two privately operated burn centers to care 
for those who have insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But when County-USC is full, the private hospitals are called upon to accept 
indigents, as well as privately insured patients. 
</P>
<P>
"We shudder when we get a call," said Ray Alan Rahn, senior vice president at 
Torrance Memorial. "Every time we get a call, it could be a half-million-dollar 
exposure for us. It's really frightening." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profit Wiped Out 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 31 patients treated at Torrance Memorial's burn center during the 
first five months of 1989, he said, were sent there because County-USC was 
full. The cost of caring for them -- about $200,000 -- wiped out the burn 
center's overall profit, provoking serious consideration of closing the unit 
down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, Rahn said, the burn center has by and large broken even. But 
this year, he said, the center has been hit by increasing numbers of patients 
with little or no insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
He provided a list of 10 instances during 1988 in which the hospital wrote off 
between $18,000 and $200,000 in medical charges incurred by patients with no 
medical insurance or limited coverage through Medi-Cal or Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them lived in parts of the county outside of the hospital's general 
service area, Rahn pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$134,000 Bill 
</P>
<P>
One woman lived as far away as Tacoma, Wash. She was driving on a freeway near 
Bakersfield when she was hit by a truck, severely burned, and helicoptered to 
Torrance Memorial. Before she died, Rahn said, she spent 22 days in the 
hospital and ran up a bill of $134,000. She had no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Patients insured through Medi-Cal and Medicare also leave behind staggering 
unpaid bills, Rahn said. Torrance Memorial is reimbursed about $900 a day for 
Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
"That formula is a disaster for us," Rahn said, because the hospital charges 
$4,300 a day for care. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials are now lobbying state health officials for an increase, 
which Rahn described as critical to the burn center's survival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BURN CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
Rising medical costs and an increase in uninsured patients have led to cutbacks 
in care at special burn centers. Los Angeles County officials say the number of 
staffed intensive care unit beds in the county's three burn centers has dropped 
to 12, from 34 two years ago. There are 12 other burn centers in the state, as 
well as one in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Three staffed, intensive-care-unit beds for burn patients are located in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>

"I'm as American as apple pie," says Angel Ferreira, adding after a pause, "or 
a burrito." 
</P>
<P>
Born in the East Los Angeles barrio, a drug-addicted high school dropout at age 
17, Ferreira is now a professional dancer, choreographer and recording artist. 
His music video -- "Wet Jam," a hybrid of home-boy rap and "Singing in the 
Rain" -- elicited bags full of adoring fan mail when it aired recently on the 
Spanish-language cable TV program MTV Internacionale. And eight major record 
companies have been trying to sign him up. 
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, 27, represents the latest evolution in American pop music, one that 
reflects the country's changing demographics and cultural mix. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Create New Market 
</P>
<P>
Having grown up listening to Top 40 radio while hearing their parents and 
grandparents speak Spanish at home, a generation of Latino kids is creating a 
market for a new kind of pop music -- born in the U.S.A., but with roots in the 
Caribbean and Central and South America. What is more, the record companies are 
gearing up to serve this new market, figuring that millions of dollars can be 
made there. 
</P>
<P>
Since the success of the movie and sound track album "La Bamba" two years ago, 
the American pop music charts have become populated by young Hispanic 
performers -- Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine, Sa-fire, Lisa Lisa 
and Cult Jam, Sweet Sensation, Expose and Martika. The latter is a 20-year-old 
Cuban-American whose single, "Toy Soldiers," recently reached the top of 
Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Ronstadt's most recent album, "Canciones de mi Padre" (Songs of My 
Father), sung entirely in Spanish, has sold more than 1 million copies. The 
group Los Lobos followed the commercial success of their "La Bamba" sound track 
with an album of traditional Mexican music. And the debut album by the Gipsy 
Kings, a band of authentic Gypsies from Southern France who play flamenco-style 
guitar and sing in an obscure French-Spanish dialect called Gitane, has been 
the most surprising hit of 1989, selling more than 500,000 copies in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's suddenly becoming cool to like Latin music," said Jose Behar, vice 
president of the Latin music division of Capitol-EMI Music. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are seeing the influence of the Hispanic community," said Luis 
Pisterman, managing director of WEA Latina, the Latin music division of Warner 
Communications' overseas record operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right at the birth of a whole new evolution in music," said Edward Sax, 
an American-born, Mexico City-based businessman who is pumping several million 
dollars into two new Los Angeles-based companies, Outpost Records and Latin 
Sound Network. 
</P>
<P>
"Latin music is right where black music was just before Motown exploded in the 
early 1960s," Sax said. "It's coming. It's in the kids' blood. And it's not 
only happening here in Los Angeles but also in Texas, Chicago, Miami and New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
The major U.S. record companies have been expecting it to happen for some time. 
They can read the census figures as well as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the Latino population of the United States has increased from 14.6 
million to an estimated 21 million, a growth rate of about 44%, six times 
greater than that of the total population. In fact, the United States now ranks 
as the fifth-largest "Hispanic country" in the world, trailing only Mexico, 
Spain, Argentina and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, it is a young population -- 68% of Latino Americans are under 35; 
their median age is 23. And they are rapidly becoming more affluent. The total 
household income of Latino Americans is about $170 billion, which represents a 
larger purchasing power than is possessed by the populations of Mexico, Central 
America, Venezuela and Colombia combined. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ignore that market; every instinct says I have to be in it," said 
Joe Smith, president of Capitol-EMI Music Inc., who has greatly expanded his 
company's Latin music division in the last few years "because I want to be 
there when it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he "got a real lesson" recently when he took one of Capitol's Latin 
artists, singer Daniella Romo, to dinner at trendy Spago restaurant. "The 
people who work there are used to seeing all kinds of stars and they don't 
react," he said. "But when she got out of the car in the parking lot, they all 
went crazy. They came out of the woodwork asking for her autograph. So you know 
it's there." 
</P>
<P>
For the big record companies, the problem has always been getting a handle on 
the Latino marketplace and making it profitable. Traditionally, the Latin music 
business has been seen as divided into five primary markets -- California, 
Texas, Chicago, Florida and New York/Puerto Rico -- individual "little 
countries" with different and mutually exclusive musical tastes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in New York and Miami, where the Latino population is mostly of 
Cuban, Puerto Rican or Dominican ancestry, the "tropical" Caribbean dance beat 
of salsa and meringue is popular. In Texas, with its large Mexican-immigrant 
population, the preferred sound is called Tejano, or Tex-Mex, a bouncy blend of 
traditional Mexican and American country and Western music. The conventional 
wisdom has always been that you can't give away Tex-Mex music in New York City 
or Miami, and salsa won't play in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
This regional segmentation is one reason the big record companies have not 
invested more heavily in the Latin music business before now, since it has 
meant that no one record or performer would likely sell on a mass scale. There 
has also been a perception that young Latinos won't listen to Latin music. 
</P>
<P>
"The young Latin population is much more interested in American music," said 
one record company president. "They're buying Bobby Brown and Madonna. They're 
here to assimilate or they would have stayed in Guadalajara." 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. "The regional thing is breaking down," said Mike Missile, a 
marketing executive for Bertelsmann Music Group, which operates RCA Records. 
"This year, salsa is selling on the West Coast and in Texas. And in New York 
City, some distributors report that over 50% of their business is Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
"Those false barriers are starting to tumble," said Missile. "Now you can 
market to the entire country." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the force of change has been the young people -- first-, 
second- and third-generation Americans with a shared "bicultural," big-city 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not illegal aliens. They've lived here all their lives. They are not 
going to return home; they are home," businessman Sax said. "They've grown up 
rooting for the Dodgers and the Lakers and listening to American Top 40 radio. 
So what you have is a burst of new music that is basically American in origin 
-- it's from the streets -- but Latin in its ancestry. It's American rock 'n' 
roll with a Hispanic flavor." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, even if these kids speak English as their first language, they 
are hearing Spanish at home," said Greta Nodar, vice president of the Los 
Angeles-based advertising agency The Hispanic Group. "Yes, they are 
assimilated, but their soul remains Hispanic. Their family does not let them 
forget they're Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Want Their Own Madonna' 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, they're listening to Madonna and Prince, but they also want their own 
Madonna," said WEA Latina's Luis Pisterman. "There has been a misconception 
that the young people won't listen to Latin music." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the big American record companies have focused their energies on 
signing up Spanish-speaking international stars such as Julio Iglesias, Jose 
Jose and Emmanuel -- singers of romantic ballads whose appeal is mostly to the 
over-40 Latino consumer. Now, however, the search is on for young, home-grown 
heroes from the streets of Los Angeles, New York and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barbara Corcoran, the producer of MTV Internacionale, the 
up-and-coming Latino stars more accurately reflect the attitudes and concerns 
of their peers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The lyrics to their songs have to do with what they are going though in these 
big urban centers, not what they left behind in some other country. Sa-fire's 
song, 'Thinking of You,' is about her uncle who died of AIDS in the Bronx. Her 
real name is Wilma Cosme." 
</P>
<P>
And the audience is responding with what appears to be pent-up enthusiasm. "We 
hosted a dance at a Houston club with a group called Pajama Party, which is 
what I call a Miami girl group," Corcoran said. "Usually, we expect about 600 
people at these shows. But 4,000 kids showed up, and they went crazy!" 
</P>
<P>
According to Corcoran and others, while most of the young Latino performers 
currently on the pop charts sing in English, the audience is equally receptive 
to Spanish. "I'll tell you something, we have done very well with Spanish 
rock," she said. "We don't believe that the only good rock music is in English. 
There's some great Latin rock 'n' roll. It has swept all of Central America. 
Rock is very political, and Central America is a very politically charged place 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
"It's really happening," Corcoran said. "We haven't gotten that one huge global 
artist yet, but there are lots of stories in the works." 
</P>
<P>
The stories are Latino versions of chasing the rock 'n' roll dream: 
</P>
<P>
"We're from Texas; 'La Bamba' made us move here," said Reuben Cruz, the leader 
of a Tex-Mex rock band called the Street Boys that recently relocated to Los 
Angeles in hopes of landing a recording contract. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cruz, before seeing the movie, the four band members -- age 20 to 
27 -- were unfamiliar with the story of Richie Valens, the East Los Angeles 
barrio kid who changed his name from Valenzuela and reached the top of the pop 
music charts with "La Bamba" and "Donna" before dying in a plane crash in 1959 
at the age of 17. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Street Boys play rock, their musical influences include childhood 
memories of "parties at our houses when we heard our parents' music," Cruz 
said. "It was so lively and you saw the whole family dancing together when they 
put that music on; it's very inspiring. Our music has that Latin feeling." 
</P>
<P>
"We sing about our experiences," he said. "Our song 'Door of Glory' is about 
leaving home, and how hard it is to step through that door of glory to find 
what it is you're looking for, whether it's in a different city, state or 
country. That's what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
At hard rock clubs such as Madam Wong's in West Los Angeles, the Street Boys 
take the stage with Mexican flags emblazoned on their jackets. "We're not 
embarrassed at being Mexican-Americans," Cruz said. "We're definitely proud of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
It took Austin-based singer-songwriter Tish Hinajosa nine years to land a 
recording contract with a major record company. "No one knew how to market me. 
I always wore my Hispanic heritage; it's a big part of my performing and 
writing," said the 33-year-old mother of two whose debut album, "Homeland," was 
just released by A&amp;M Records. 
</P>
<P>
Born in San Antonio, the youngest of 13 children of Mexican immigrant parents, 
Hinajosa's music -- like her name -- reflects the almost schizophrenic 
experience of one who was "raised listening to the Beatles and hearing Spanish 
being spoken at home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted to Be American 
</P>
<P>
Growing up, "everyone wanted to be so American. We were supposed to grow out of 
the Hispanic culture. We had to prove that we were American. We were not 
encouraged to be Hispanic. We had Hispanic surnames but only spoke English." 
</P>
<P>
Three songs on her new album are sung entirely in Spanish, and several others 
contain Spanish verses. They tell of life on both sides of the border: 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin loves his homeland, but it can't give him enough. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants a good life, a job and a wife 
</P>
<P>
 and some children with dreams that come true. 
</P>
<P>
One song is clearly autobiographical, about Felipe and Maria, who crossed the 
Rio Grande to raise a family of 13 on the west side of San Antonio: 
</P>
<P>
 Days were good and days were bad, 
</P>
<P>
 but mostly they were lean. 
</P>
<P>
 School and shoes and food and books 
</P>
<P>
 believin' in a prayer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They were pilgrims that made 
</P>
<P>
 a good life the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
"The message I want to get across to younger Hispanic-Americans is that it's OK 
to be part of both cultures," Hinajosa said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most remarkable story of all is that of Angel Ferreira, whose 
ticket out of poverty and drugs in East L.A. was a scholarship to the famed 
Joffrey Ballet in New York City. From there he landed a role in the movie, "A 
Chorus Line," and wound up as the principal dancer on Madonna's 1987 world 
concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
Now a resident of Los Angeles again, Ferreira has carved a niche for himself as 
a choreographer of music videos, working with such groups as Pretty Poison and 
Milli Vanilli. His own heroes range from soul singer James Brown to Fred 
Astaire and Gene Kelly. And he admits that he was stunned by the thousands of 
fan letters responding to his "Wet Jam" video on MTV Internacionale. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't 'I think you're cute, marry me' stuff. It was more 'I think you are 
a great representative of our culture. You made me proud.' It obviously 
inspired them," he said, slipping into the vernacular of his barrio roots. 
"They're saying, 'Hey, this brother came from the neighborhood. Check it out; 
he's really cutting it up.' "

PALOMAR OBSERVATORY IS SPARED AS FIRE SHIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palomar Observatory was shut down Thursday as a stubborn wilderness fire 
that has charred thousands of acres burned within 3 miles of its grounds, but a 
nature sanctuary at Eagle Crag that is home for endangered eagles was spared. 
</P>
<P>
Observatory spokesman Bob Thicksten announced the closure as hundreds of 
firefighters began setting up a bivouac around the two domes that house four 
telescopes, including one with a 200-inch mirror that is the world's second 
largest and most famous. At 4 p.m., U. S. Forest Service officials announced 
that erratic winds had shifted the fire away from the observatory, in a 
westerly direction. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thicksten said the observatory will be closed to the public until 
further notice. The telescopes have not been used since Saturday because of ash 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Happy Scientists 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to close to the public because of all the forestry personnel on our 
grounds. . . . But the telescopes have not been available to astronomers since 
last Saturday because of the ash," Thicksten said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists usually reserve the telescopes months or years in advance. Thicksten 
said scientists who were unlucky enough to have reservations while the 
observatory is closed "will just lose their time." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have happy campers or scientists around here. They will just have to 
reschedule for next year. It's frustrating," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said Thursday that the fire had burned about 10,270 acres in 
rugged, mostly inaccessible terrain in the Cleveland National Forest. Manzanita 
bushes that had not burned in more than a century were feeding the flames. 
According to Forestry Service officials, about 400 acres of rare Douglas big 
cones, which grow to 100 feet, also burned. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began Saturday at 11:30 a.m., south of Vail Lake, in Riverside County, 
by a recreational shooter who was in a legal shooting area, said U. S. Forestry 
spokesman Bill Bruggema. The fire quickly jumped into San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day cost of fighting the fire, which officials said was 57% contained, 
was put at $2.3 million on Thursday. Bruggema estimated that it will cost $5 
million before the fire is brought under control. The fire line was manned by 
about 1,800 firefighters, who were helped by 11 air tankers from the California 
National Guard and the Forest Service, six helicopters and almost 100 pieces of 
equipment on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighting crews from as far away as Alaska and Pennsylvania have been 
committed to the fire line. Several California prison inmates were also being 
used to fight the fire, officials said. Several minor injuries were reported, 
including one to a firefighter who was hospitalized with a broken collarbone 
Wednesday when a rock landed on him. Three structures have been reported 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, officials were concerned that high winds, accompanied by 
temperatures in the 90s and low humidity, would push the fire toward the Eagle 
Crag Sanctuary, which is in the Agua Tibia Wilderness. The sanctuary is home to 
golden eagles and, in the winter, to bald eagles. Phil Unit, an ornithologist 
with the Natural History Museum at Balboa Park, said the sanctuary is also home 
to spotted owls. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctuary was saved by a ring of firefighters that was thrown 
around its boundary. Backfires were lighted to keep the flames away. 
</P>
<P>
By the afternoon, flames were licking the northeast corner of the Pala Indian 
Reservation. Reservation Fire Capt. Robert Smith said about 100 acres had 
burned at the reservation's Mission Reserve, an area of 3,000 acres of timber. 
Forestry Service officials had asked tribal leaders for permission to light 
backfires to stop the fire, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Several areas and isolated settlements have been evacuated since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The unpredictable fire suddenly changed direction again Thursday and headed 
northwest, toward its point of origin. The Butterfield Campground in Riverside 
County, which was one of the first areas evacuated on Saturday, was suddenly in 
the fire's path again. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Hotchkiss, 56, who lives about a quarter of a mile southeast of the 
campground, was evacuated, along with a son and daughter who live in separate 
trailers. Hotchkiss and her family watched in horror Thursday as the fire got 
as close as 200 yards from their homes before it was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"The firefighters are doing a good job fighting it. It's just the wind whipping 
them," Hotchkiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Denise White, 29, said she lost her bookkeeping job in Temecula 
because she has not been able to get to work all week. She stayed home to guard 
her property against the fire. Her employer did not believe the fire posed a 
danger to her family's homes and property, she said.

The House ignored a veto threat by President Bush and voted to ease 
restrictions on public financing of abortions in the District of Columbia, 
halting nine straight years of House votes tightening control over government 
abortion aid. The 238-189 vote sent the measure to the Senate, where its fate 
is uncertain. The legislation is the first containing abortion language that 
Congress has considered since the Supreme Court granted states the rights to 
impose new limitations on abortion last month. Currently, public assistance is 
available in the district only when the mother's life is threatened.

TEXAS ENACTS FLAG LAW TO COUNTER COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Gov. Bill Clements signed a bill establishing a new state flag 
desecration law to replace the one thrown out by the Supreme Court. The 
measure, similar to one pending in Congress, makes it a crime to desecrate the 
American flag and does not include language that the Supreme Court found 
objectionable when it ruled in June that flag burning was a protected form of 
free speech. The new Texas law also makes it a crime to desecrate the state 
flag. President Bush has argued that the court's ruling cannot be overturned 
with a simple bill, either at the state or federal level, contending that a 
constitutional amendment is needed to give the states and the Congress the 
power to draft bills against flag desecration. The Texas Legislature has also 
passed a resolution urging Congress to approve the constitutional change.

AF PILOT GETS JAIL FOR BIGAMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Air Force officer panel in San Francisco sentenced a veteran pilot to three 
months in a military jail and dismissal from the service for his conviction on 
bigamy charges. The panel ruled that Capt. Neil Clark must also give up three 
months' pay, amounting to $8,600. In addition, because his dismissal will come 
nine months shy of 20 years' service, Clark will lose his retirement benefits 
and pension. Clark's attorneys contend that he was so driven by lust that he 
entered into a bigamous marriage with an English woman in order to have sex 
with her. Testimony indicated that the woman wanted to marry a U.S. citizen to 
remain in this country.

SRI LANKA RADICALS KILL 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sinhalese radicals shot and killed 18 people, including a high-ranking Buddhist 
priest, in a series of attacks in southern Sri Lanka, officials said. Gunmen 
from the People's Liberation Front stormed a Buddhist temple in Colombo, the 
capital, and killed the Rev. Kotikawatte Saddhatissa Thera, who had endorsed an 
offer by President Ranasinghe Premadasa to negotiate with the Sinhalese radical 
group. The other killings included nine people slain by Sinhalese gunmen at the 
home of United National Party legislator P. D. Abeyaratna, who was not at home. 
The nation's Sinhalese majority feel Premadasa has made too many concessions to 
Tamil rebels seeking autonomy. The bloodshed came as India and Sri Lanka held 
talks for a sixth day on a timetable for withdrawing Indian peacekeeping 
troops.

The San Francisco Police Commission has voted unanimously to hold a hearing 
into the case of four officers accused of improper conduct, including the 
police chief's brother. The commission took the action on the recommendation of 
Deputy Police Chief Willis Casey, who was picked by the commission to replace 
Chief Frank Jordan in dealing with the charges. The chief's brother, Deputy 
Chief John Jordan, and the others allegedly removed a document from the file of 
an officer accused of beating farm labor leader Dolores Huerta during a 
demonstration last fall.

A man assembling a bomb in a West London hotel blew himself up, police said. 
The explosion tore through the small five-story Beverley House hotel in 
Paddington, blasting a hole in the roof and starting a fire but causing no 
other casualties. Anti-terrorist squad Commander George Churchill-Coleman told 
reporters, "It (the blast) was caused by some form of improvised explosive 
device." Churchill-Coleman ruled out an Irish connection after detectives 
established that the dead man was from the Middle East. Security forces are on 
the alert ahead of the 20th anniversary of the dispatch of British troops to 
Northern Ireland, where guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army are fighting to 
end British rule.

Legislation that prohibits ex-felons from owning or possessing all firearms, 
including rifles and shotguns, has been signed by Gov. George Deukmejian. The 
measure by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco) conforms state 
law to federal law, which prohibits people convicted of a felony from owning or 
possessing a firearm. California law had barred ex-felons from having 
concealable weapons -- handguns -- but did not outlaw rifles and shotguns. 
"It's been a criminally absurd exclusion for years, and it's costing us human 
lives," Speier said. The new law makes it a crime that could be charged as a 
misdemeanor or felony, depending on the circumstances. Speier's bill was backed 
by a number of law enforcement agencies including police departments, sheriff's 
departments and district attorneys' offices throughout the state.

underground group, the Chinese League for Justice and Democracy, calls in the 
manifesto for the removal from office of the current Communist leadership. The 
statement -- being distributed over a worldwide network of facsimile machines 
-- describes the league as "a nonviolent organization" seeking "the

SCRAPPING OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The state's system for financing political campaigns is now in such disarray 
that it should be scrapped and replaced by a comprehensive new program to 
regulate fund-raising, the sponsor of one of two voter-approved election 
financing initiatives said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a negotiated solution to the campaign finance dispute, 
California Common Cause would be willing to give up some provisions of its 
initiative that were upheld this week by the state Court of Appeal, said Walter 
Zelman, the organization's director. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad we won, but we're not zealots," said Zelman, spokesman for the 
sponsors of Proposition 68. "We recognize that it would be healthier if we 
could all get together and try to craft a comprehensive program where the 
pieces all fit together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Assessments 
</P>
<P>
If the ruling stands as is, several lawmakers and political consultants said in 
interviews, it would handicap challengers to such an extent that incumbents 
would be virtually guaranteed reelection unless they committed some heinous 
act. 
</P>
<P>
"We could effectively abolish elections and save ourselves the expense," said 
Sal Russo, a consultant who works for Republican candidates. "I think this is a 
disaster for representative democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic strategist David Townsend said the new restrictions will keep most 
challengers from raising enough money to mail more than a single campaign 
pamphlet to each voter in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
"The incumbents ought to be dancing in the streets," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
The object of the criticism was a ruling by a panel of three judges -- two 
appointed by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian -- upholding several provisions 
of Proposition 68, which was approved by the voters in June, 1988. Most of the 
initiative had been put on hold by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission because another campaign finance measure, Proposition 73, received 
more votes in the same election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect of Decision 
</P>
<P>
The court decision reinstated three parts of Proposition 68: a ban on campaign 
fund-raising in non-election years, a limit on the amount of money candidates 
can accept from corporations, labor unions and political action committees, and 
a cap on the total amount that those groups can contribute to campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
These regulations, the court held, should take effect alongside Proposition 
73's restrictions, which banned transfers of campaign money from one politician 
to another and limited contributions to $1,000 from individuals and 
corporations and $5,000 from broad-based political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling did not allow enactment of Proposition 68's provisions calling for 
partial taxpayer financing of legislative campaigns. Zelman said he still holds 
out hope that the Legislature will approve a plan for public financing and 
submit it to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said he believes that the law as it now stands will not help incumbents. 
But he said Proposition 68's provision limiting Assembly candidates to a total 
of $50,000 from corporations, labor unions and political action committees 
might be "too tough" a standard without public financing. Senate candidates 
would be limited to $75,000 from those groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiate Changes 
</P>
<P>
He said Common Cause might be willing to negotiate changes in those limits as 
well as the ban on fund-raising in non-election years if lawmakers will agree 
to public financing. The entire package would be submitted to the voters in 
1990, Zelman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), one of three legislative authors of 
the competing Proposition 73, said such a deal is not in the works. Asked when 
legislators could be expected to adopt taxpayer financing for campaigns, he 
replied: "Never." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not there is an agreement, the court decision is scheduled to go 
into effectOct. 1 unless it is delayed by an appeal to the California Supreme 
Court. The FPPC, the loser in the case, is considering an appeal but is also 
preparing regulations to implement the decision, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra and a San Francisco law 
firm that has represented Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) are 
also considering asking the Supreme Court to review the case along with several 
others that are pending on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruling Called 'Bizarre' 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who termed the ruling "bizarre," has already raised nearly $600,000 this 
year and plans a major fund-raiser at a Sacramento sports arena on Aug. 23. 
Together, members of the Assembly collected nearly $7 million in the first six 
months of the year -- $1 million more than they raised in 1987, the last 
non-election year. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman and others predicted that companies and lobbyists who have interests 
before the Legislature can expect a "barrage" of invitations to fund-raisers 
before the Oct. 1 deadline set by the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd sure hate to be a lobbyist next week," Townsend said.

SWEEPING ECOLOGY INITIATIVE PROMISED BY VAN DE KAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Van de Kamp pledged Thursday that a cornerstone of his campaign for 
governor will be to present voters with one of the most sweeping environmental 
ballot propositions in state history -- a measure to protect the coast from oil 
spills, food from pesticides and the atmosphere from ozone-gobbling chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second give-'em-hell ballot initiative that the 1990 Democratic 
candidate for governor has proposed this summer, both part of a novel and 
emerging strategy designed to give Californians the opportunity to vote for his 
platform, not his promises. The first measure dealt with ethics in government 
and terms of offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favorite Targets 
</P>
<P>
At news conferences around the state on Thursday, Van de Kamp said he hoped his 
new initiative would rally environmentalists to join together and take on some 
of their favorite targets: oil companies, pesticide manufacturers and those who 
produce chemicals that break down ozone. 
</P>
<P>
He borrowed from many diverse sources for elements of the plan -- everyone from 
liberal Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) to the Bush Administration: 
</P>
<P>
Major provisions that were outlined only in general terms: 
</P>
<P>
* Establishment of a $500-million trust fund for oil spill prevention and 
cleanup. Van de Kamp said there was a 94% probability of Southern California 
enduring a "Valdez-class oil spill" in the next 30 years. The fund would be 
established over a five-year period through a 25-cent-per-barrel "fee" on oil 
moving through the state. 
</P>
<P>
* Strict but thus-far unspecified "regulations to stop the discharge of 
dangerous toxins into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
* A crash effort to make California the first state in the nation to formally 
commit to the goal set internationally at a Helsinki conference earlier this 
year -- the phasing out of all use of chemicals which destroy ozone by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
* The phasing out of "the use of those pesticides that we already know to cause 
cancer," and "more stringent regulation of pesticides in general." 
</P>
<P>
* Institution of a new requirement for planting trees in conjunction with all 
future development, and a $200-million bond issue for forest planting and 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environment Issue 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said the precise language of each provision would be drafted by his 
campaign in consultation with environmental groups during the weeks ahead. The 
measure will be submitted for signature gathering this fall and is aimed for 
the November, 1990, general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment of this state has suffered tremendous damage during a decade 
in which extraordinary growth has been accompanied by extraordinary neglect at 
the highest levels in Washington and Sacramento," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an indicator of the power of the environment as an issue, Van de Kamp's 
leading Republican rival in the far-off governor's race, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, 
did not object to the tax on oil and creation of a trust fund. Rather, Wilson 
said Van de Kamp was being too modest. 
</P>
<P>
"The Alaska spill has already cost $800 million. His fund would have been 
depleted," said Wilson, who currently is backing $1-billion federal trust fund 
legislation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson went further and grumped about Van de Kamp's timing -- which indeed was 
known to have been rushed. "He must have some pretty good intelligence about 
what I'm up to," the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
More critical was the campaign of Democratic rival Dianne Feinstein, former 
mayor of San Francisco. Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers noted that Van de 
Kamp has spent more than a full week denouncing still another initiative 
because of what the attorney general said is a two-word flaw. She was referring 
to the "Speedy Trials Initiative" sponsored by Wilson, which Van de Kamp says 
contains a two-word constitutional change regarding privacy rights that could 
inadvertently jeopardize a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"All we've seen of Van de Kamp's two initiatives are slick press releases 
fashioned after public opinion polls. How do we know that his initiatives when 
they are drafted won't contain the same kind of flaws?" she demanded. 
</P>
<P>
But politicians are in an awkward spot in challenging ideas that have already 
received wide discussion and support. Take another would-be candidate in the 
field, for instance, Democratic state Controller Gray Davis. Davis is the 
originator of the idea for the $500-million oil-spill trust fund. Van de Kamp 
credited him for the proposal but did not consult with him. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he was "pleased" that Van de Kamp endorsed the idea, but said he 
hoped the Legislature would enact the fund first. 
</P>
<P>
As for the other elements? "I don't think the attorney general thought up any 
of them. They represent the best thoughts of many groups," Davis said. Then 
Davis added his own endorsement, "I support all of those individual concepts. 
And I would be willing to support them as a package." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said he had little faith that the Legislature could tackle such a 
major reform as this. It was the same argument he used with his proposal last 
month to limit terms of office for state officials and impose new ethics 
standards. There is no choice because the Legislature is "paralyzed" by 
special-interest money. 
</P>
<P>
The merits of the two proposals aside, Van de Kamp's initiatives -- and his 
pro-abortion attack on rival Wilson's initiative -- have accomplished two goals 
that his campaign believes essential: 
</P>
<P>
First, it has given Van de Kamp, the Establishment politician with the 
patrician name and genteel breeding, a slight Populist cast. The initiatives 
are supposed to say, Van de Kamp will fight against them for you. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he has quieted those doubters, including friendly doubters, who 
believed Van de Kamp deep in his bones is too cautious and pale for the 
challenge. "For the first time this year, Van de Kamp has begun to engage 
Wilson in a debate," said one Democrat who has been quietly critical of the 
attorney general's campaign. "But these last couple of weeks give us 
encouragement and dispel the myth that Wilson is the inevitable victor."

PANEL TO REVIEW DESIGN OF WIDE-BODY JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration, citing last month's DC-10 crash in Sioux 
City, Iowa, and two other jumbo jet accidents, called Thursday for a design 
review and a possible redesign of wide-body aircraft to improve their ability 
to survive in-flight damage. 
</P>
<P>
While investigators continued to comb the Sioux City cornfields for clues to 
explain the unprecedented explosion of the tail engine on the United Airlines 
jet, the FAA announced the formation of a task force to explore ways to better 
protect the control systems of DC-10s, Boeing 747s, Lockheed L-1011s, Airbus 
300s and other wide-body jets. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are not questioning the safety of the jumbo jets but are 
looking for ways to improve the margin of safety in unusual in-flight 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jets Termed Safe to Fly 
</P>
<P>
"All jumbo jets that fly today and are certified by the FAA are safe to fly and 
provide the safest form of transportation available," said Anthony J. 
Broderick, FAA deputy administrator for regulation and certification. "The task 
force will be charged with improving them even further." 
</P>
<P>
The task force, modeled on another panel formed to study aging aircraft, will 
include representatives of airlines, aircraft manufacturers and domestic and 
foreign government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The group will look at ways to protect the control lines by providing more, 
different or better backup systems and devices. That could mean more valves to 
prevent the loss of hydraulic fluid, or different placement of the valves and 
hydraulic lines or stronger materials. 
</P>
<P>
A subgroup already has scheduled a meeting for Monday. Results will be reported 
as they are determined, with conclusions expected in two to four months, 
Broderick said. Although the task force does not have the power to order design 
changes, its recommendations would have significant weight with the FAA in any 
decision to formulate new design regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Design changes could affect the 2,030 wide-bodies in service worldwide, said 
Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm. The changes, which could cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars, also would affect future aircraft such as the 
MD-11, the successor to the DC-10 planned by McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp. "supports the action of the FAA in setting up the task 
force," spokesman Don Hanson said. "We are confident the results would benefit 
the entire commercial transportation industry." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing said it would participate in the task force but issued a statement 
suggesting that it already has accomplished what the task force seeks to do: 
"By design, the Boeing fleet is protected so that sufficient flight control 
power would be available to vital functions in the event of any uncontained 
engine or auxiliary power unit burst." 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed spokesman said it would be premature to comment on the task force. 
He noted that Lockheed stopped producing commercial aircraft in 1983 but could 
be affected by any ordered retrofit. 
</P>
<P>
FAA officials cited the July 19 crash in Iowa as the third accident in which 
major in-flight damage caused, or nearly caused, the total loss of control of 
an aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In the Iowa accident, the tail engine blew apart, spraying shrapnel that 
ruptured the three hydraulic systems that provide the pressure to control the 
flaps, slats, rudder and other parts that steer the plane. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 lost all four hydraulic systems after the 
aft bulkhead ruptured and a rush of air from the cabin knocked off part of the 
jet's rudder and vertical stabilizer. After that accident, the FAA ordered 
Boeing to better separate the hydraulic lines in the tail. 
</P>
<P>
In the third incident cited, an Eastern Air Lines L-1011 landed safely at John 
F. Kennedy International Airport in New York after part of the center engine 
broke in flight. The engine shaft broke, allowing the fan section to move into 
the fuselage.

RABIN SEES NEW DEMAND PAVING WAY FOR PRISONER SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin thinks that a new demand made by Muslim 
militants in Lebanon has paved the way for a prisoner exchange, Rabin's 
spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Eitan Haber, referred to a statement issued earlier Thursday in 
Lebanon announcing the lifting of a threat to kill American hostage Joseph J. 
Cicippio and demanding freedom for the Muslim leader seized by Israeli 
commandos plus other Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Haber said the Muslim militants appeared to hint at an exchange, saying they 
would provide the Red Cross with a list of prisoners they want freed by the 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to prepare a list of prisoners," he said. "We do, too." 
</P>
<P>
Haber went on to say: "The purpose of our action in Lebanon (in seizing Sheik 
Abdel Karim Obeid last week) was to bring back our prisoners and missing 
soldiers home to Israel. If the information coming from Beirut is correct, we 
shall look at their suggestion with interest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rabin Developed Plan 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Rabin is considered the key figure in Israel's strategy to 
recover its soldiers. He formulated the plan to abduct Obeid, a Muslim 
clergyman, in order to improve the chances for a prisoner exchange. 
Traditionally, the Defense Ministry negotiates for the return of missing 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Israel would include American and other foreign 
hostages on the list of people it wants liberated. Earlier in the day, a senior 
Foreign Ministry official said that Israel now considers Western hostages and 
Israel's captives to be part of the same "pie" and that no exchange would be 
complete without all being freed or accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Obeid's abduction touched off an international crisis as followers of 
Hezbollah, the Muslim terrorist group to which Obeid belongs, threatened to 
kill Western hostages in retaliation unless Obeid were released. 
</P>
<P>
A group that called itself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth announced 
Monday that it had hanged one of the hostage Americans, Marine Lt. Col. William 
R. Higgins. Another group, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, threatened 
to kill Cicippio. Both groups are believed to be factions of Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the Revolutionary Justice Organization announced that it had 
suspended the death threat against Cicippio and set forth a new demand. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the release of Obeid, the group demanded freedom for Lebanese 
prisoners held by Israel and freedom for Palestinians held for involvement in 
the Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Israel holds scores of Lebanese prisoners in southern Lebanon and thousands of 
Palestinian prisoners in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
An official at the Foreign Ministry, in response to reporters' questions, said, 
"We are saying exactly nothing." He added, however, that he was relieved that 
Cicippio had not been killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ex-Prisoners Tied to Uprising 
</P>
<P>
Addition of the Palestinian prisoners to the earlier demands could create 
resistance in Israel. Four years ago, Israel freed 1,200 Palestinians in return 
for the liberation of three soldiers held by Palestinian groups in Lebanon, and 
analysts here say the freed prisoners became the core organizing force of the 
Arab uprising in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the Palestinians could be included in an exchange only 
if they were expelled to Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the death sentence against Cicippio led Israeli officials to 
think that the crisis may have crested. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the immediate passion is gone, it is less likely the threats will be 
renewed," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials also expressed confidence that after days of strain in 
relations with the United States, Washington is now committed to Israel's view 
of how to deal with the hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The officials appeared pleased at what they considered a reduction of pressure 
on Israel to free Obeid. They viewed the combination of having Obeid in their 
hands and getting U.S. support as offering the best chance for the release of 
the Muslim militants' hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past 48 hours, we have been in close coordination with the United 
States," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure should be applied mainly to Iran, Israeli officials said. They said 
the movement of U.S. warships in the Mediterranean was a step in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that Israel and the United States embrace the same guiding 
principles: to refuse to free Obeid unless Hezbollah agrees to a prisoner 
exchange; to place sole responsibility on the Muslim extremists for endangering 
American hostages; to threaten to retaliate if the hostages are harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Adherence to these principles, the officials said, will encourage the militants 
to accept Israel's offer to exchange Obeid and other prisoners for the hostages 
-- barring something unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the crazies up in Lebanon could defy all this," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel was stunned by the early negative reaction to its abduction of Obeid and 
two associates. It had hoped to use Obeid to make a deal for the release of 
Israeli captives and perhaps other foreigners held in Lebanon. Criticism that 
Israel's unilateral act had put the hostages in danger prompted Israel to 
undertake a public relations campaign to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was put in charge of monitoring the 
political fallout. An official in the Foreign Ministry said that the public 
opinion score card looked better than it did a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Our consulate in New York was getting three negative phone calls for every two 
in our favor," he said. "Now, it's 5 to 1 for us! There were phone calls to the 
BBC in Britain -- 75% like our stand." 
</P>
<P>
Besides keeping the Bush Administration in its corner, Israel is counting on 
the value of Obeid to Hezbollah. Israeli officials insist that Obeid is going 
to be an important source of intelligence -- unless Hezbollah agrees soon to an 
exchange and gets him away from Israeli interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
"He's talking," a high-ranking Israeli official said. "He'll talk more. And 
they know it. He's giving names -- and addresses." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials blame Obeid for many acts of violence dating back to 1983, 
including car bombings, attacks on Israeli soldiers and the abduction of 
Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
But some observers are not so sure. A foreign security official in Lebanon 
said, "If I were to name the 50 Hezbollah leaders who make decisions in south 
Lebanon, he would not be on the list." 
</P>
<P>
Up until his abduction, Obeid was considered less than an important leader in 
Hezbollah's southern Lebanon operations. Rather, it was a Hezbollah leader 
named Abbas Musawi who ran guerrillas against Israel in the south. Obeid was 
described as a cheerleader and dispenser of money to needy Shiite Muslim 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The loud and threatening reaction to his abduction, experts here say, is based 
not so much on what he knows as on what he stands for. The abduction of a 
Muslim clergyman is an affront to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicions that Obeid might not be a top-rank figure emerged quickly because of 
the ease with which he was captured. Israeli commandos blew in the door of his 
house in Jibchit village and took him away without much difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Netanyahu, asked about these suspicions, said: "Obeid 
thought he was in Hezbollah heaven -- a place where he was immune. So he didn't 
need any guards."

'NO GOING BACK' ON BATTLE AGAINST ISRAEL, ARAFAT SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
PLO leader Yasser Arafat defended the principle of armed struggle Thursday, 
calling it a "legitimate weapon" against Israeli occupation and a stepping 
stone toward the creation of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no going back on the course which it (the Palestinian people) has 
taken," Arafat told a general congress of Fatah, the largest group in the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day congress is Fatah's first since 1980; its main tasks will be to 
elect new leaders and review overall strategy. The meeting opened under tight 
security in central Tunis with Tunisian President Zine Abidine ben Ali as guest 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, under pressure to approve violence outside the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, said the PLO has condemned terrorism because it believes in justice 
and does not want to adopt the same methods Israel uses against Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renounced Terrorism 
</P>
<P>
Arafat renounced terrorism last December as part of a PLO peace initiative 
based on the idea of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories, alongside 
Israel within its pre-1967 borders. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO leader, in green military uniform and traditional black-and-white 
headdress, defended the principle of armed struggle, however, saying it had 
laid the foundation for Fatah's political achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"As the legitimate weapon against the Israeli occupation, it gave us a 
distinguished position in the forefront of the struggle of the world's 
liberation movements and won us international support," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But the intifada -- the Palestinian uprising now in its 20th month -- has 
opened new chances of peace, Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
"With it, a new stage began. . . . It has brought realistic possibilities that 
the Palestinian people might achieve what they have been deprived of since the 
partition (of Palestine) in 1948 -- a Palestinian state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticizes U.S. Response 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader criticized Washington for what he called a half-hearted 
response to the PLO initiative and reluctance to make political concessions to 
the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Washington opened a dialogue with the PLO in December, but it has bogged down 
in argument over the Palestinian response to Israel's plan for elections in the 
occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat again rejected the Israeli election plan in its present form, saying the 
Israeli government's real motives were to sabotage the peace process, 
legitimize its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and delude international 
public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages elections for local councilors who would eventually 
negotiate on the final status of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
"The PLO has said any temporary measures must be linked . . . with a final 
settlement based on ending the Israeli occupation, self-determination, national 
independence and a just settlement of the refugee problem," he said.

RAFSANJANI SWORN IN BUT FACES CRISIS ON FIRST DAY 
</P>

Hashemi Rafsanjani was sworn in Thursday as Iran's president and pledged to 
continue the 10-year-old Islamic revolution. But he faced a crisis on his first 
day in office: the threat of U.S. retaliation over hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in a mosque attached to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
home in north Tehran, Rafsanjani's voice shook with emotion as he promised to 
follow in the footsteps of the revolutionary patriarch, who died June 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the propaganda coming from the arrogant world powers, our people will 
not accept anything but the continuation of this path, which is the path of 
Islam and the Koran," he told religious and government leaders in a speech 
carried by Tehran Radio. 
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the hostage issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won 94.5% of Vote 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, 54, a middle-ranking clergyman from a wealthy pistachio-growing 
family in southern Iran, captured 94.5% of the vote in the July 28 election to 
become the Islamic republic's fifth head of state. 
</P>
<P>
He will wield considerably more power than did his predecessors under 
constitutional reforms approved by 97% of voters in a referendum. The reforms 
abolish the post of prime minister, currently held by Hussein Moussavi, and 
allow the president to appoint and fire Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
But Rafsanjani, said to be eager to improve ties with the West, is being tested 
almost immediately by the hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese terrorists, who said they hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. 
Higgins this week, threatened to execute another American hostage, Joseph J. 
Cicippio, if Israel does not release a kidnaped Muslim clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said he is using every possible diplomatic channel to resolve 
the hostage crisis, while "prudently planning" for military action if Cicippio 
is killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Message to Iran 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official said a message sent indirectly to Iran had said in 
substance, "If anything happens to the hostages, we hold you responsible." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United States was 
pleased with a statement Tuesday by Rafsanjani condemning the killing of 
Higgins and all acts of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is believed to want to erase Iran's image as a sponsor of 
international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his sweeping victory, Rafsanjani may have to proceed carefully, 
particularly in dealing with the West, to avoid an open break with powerful 
radicals dedicated to preserving the ideological purity of Khomeini's 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times said Thursday that the West should follow the example of the 
French, who "succeeded in winning release of their hostages in Beirut because 
they made an honorable deal." 
</P>
<P>
All French hostages in Lebanon were released in 1987. Rafsanjani has previously 
linked using Iran's influence to free American hostages to release of Iranian 
assets frozen by the United States.

REV. JACKSON REGISTERS AS VOTER IN CAPITAL

The Rev. Jesse Jackson registered to vote in the District of Columbia on 
Thursday, but shed no new light on a possible run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has previously said he is "not running" for mayor in the nation's 
capital. "I have no plans to run for mayor and there is no office for mayor or 
any other office in D.C. open in 1989," Jackson said Thursday. But he has 
refused to rule out entering the race later. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Jacqueline, spent about 10 minutes filling out a series of 
forms and registered as Democrats, according to city elections officials. 
</P>
<P>
After registering, Jackson said Washington would be the focal point of his 
national political agenda, which includes improving education, fighting drugs 
and gaining statehood for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Be of Service' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be of service to the people of the nation and Washington, D.C.," 
Jackson said. "Washington, D.C., is the point of challenge today for an urban 
policy for the nation." 
</P>
<P>
City law requires that mayoral candidates be registered to vote in the district 
at least one year before the general election. The next election is scheduled 
for Nov. 6, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has said he would never run against Mayor Marion Barry Jr., an ally 
from the civil rights movement, but after Barry declared he would seek a fourth 
term, Jackson refused to take himself out of consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Democratic presidential hopeful has said he was moving to the 
nation's capital to be closer to the legislative process. The national offices 
of the Rainbow Coalition, a poor people's advocacy group Jackson founded, is 
scheduled to open offices here in September. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's Chicago office said Thursday that he has moved into a three-bedroom 
apartment, where he will live until a house he has bought has been renovated. 
</P>
<P>
While the law does not require that a mayor also be a registered voter, only 
registered voters can compete in primary elections, said William H. Lewis, 
general counsel to the elections board. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has said he has no plans to sell his Chicago home.

MYSTERY DEEPENS OVER WOMAN'S DEATH; NO DRUGS FOUND IN BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mystery surrounding the death of a Compton College honors student found in 
the trunk of a car parked in downtown San Diego deepened Thursday as a 
coroner's investigation determined that she did not die of a cocaine overdose, 
as San Diego police initially reported. 
</P>
<P>
But court records in Los Angeles County show that Lina Dolores Aldridge, 19, 
was undergoing drug rehabilitation counseling in connection with a cocaine 
possession case in the year leading up to her death. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and relatives have maintained all along that Aldridge, a student leader 
at Compton College, did not die of a drug overdose. On Thursday, her aunt, 
Julia Aldridge, said the family "knew in the first place" that police were 
wrong in concluding that she had died from cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery that Aldridge had no cocaine in her body left police without any 
explanation for her death and without any proof of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County coroner's office has already ruled out other common street 
drugs, such as methamphetamine and PCP. Further toxicology tests for 
prescription and over-the-counter drugs will be completed by Monday, according 
to chief toxicologist Richard Shaw, but officials said it is possible that 
those tests will be inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Aldridge's body, which authorities believe had been in the car trunk for as 
long as 18 hours before it was found last Friday, had partially decomposed, 
hindering pathologists in their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police said Aldridge had last been seen in the company of Roy 
Williams, a star center on the Compton College basketball team, who told San 
Diego authorities that Aldridge overdosed after she inhaled cocaine at the home 
of an unidentified drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 24, was taken into custody in Compton last Friday, then released 
after one day. Compton and San Diego police have said that he is no longer a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Williams could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they based their original statements about Aldridge's possible 
cocaine overdose on statements made to them by Williams and other unidentified 
sources. Williams told police that the two had driven to San Diego but that he 
had left Aldridge at an unidentified drug dealer's house. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't make up this assumption," San Diego Police Detective Bill 
Nulton said. "The possibility of a cocaine overdose didn't just come out of the 
clear blue sky." 
</P>
<P>
Nulton stressed that the cocaine overdose report was offered to the news media 
only as a theory and was never intended as a formal conclusion in the case. 
</P>
<P>
However, records in Inglewood Municipal Court show that Aldridge had been 
receiving drug counseling since last September. 
</P>
<P>
Aldridge and a companion -- identified only as Dexter Johnson -- were arrested 
outside the Comfort Inn motel in Lennox last September, the court documents 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been stopped by police in the motel parking lot, and a quarter 
of a gram of cocaine was discovered inside Johnson's car. Aldridge told 
officers that she was unaware of the cocaine, but probation officers 
recommended counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Aldridge was placed in a one-year drug-diversion program as part of a 
plea-bargain agreement. Court records show that she attended her last session 
four days before her death. 
</P>
<P>
In a hand-written report to the court, the popular college sophomore said she 
had stopped associating with troublesome people. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as my future is concerned, I intend on keeping my present job and 
staying in school," Aldridge wrote to her counselor. "This is my second year at 
Compton College. . . . I work and go to school every day. I plan on . . . one 
day becoming a successful lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
In her hometown of Compton, meanwhile, Mayor Walter Tucker, a family neighbor 
who employed Aldridge as a part-time receptionist in his dental office, said he 
never detected any signs of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not denying anything that may be brought out," Tucker said. "I'm just 
saying that I wasn't aware of it. . . . She was always neat and courteous and 
on time." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker added that he found the circumstances of her death particularly galling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she deserved to be placed in a trunk," he said. "I wouldn't have 
done that to a dog." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's son, Walter Tucker Jr., who has been hired as the family's attorney, 
said he is acting as a liaison between the family and the police to ensure that 
the case is fairly resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that she didn't lock herself in that 
car," Tucker said. "So how did she get there? We're just encouraging the police 
to do their job." 
</P>
<P>
One question still unanswered is the nature of the relationship between 
Aldridge and Williams. Aldridge's friends and relatives said Williams refused 
to accept Aldridge's rejections. But Williams' friends tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
They say Williams, who recently won a basketball scholarship at Idaho State 
University, was a popular athlete who had no trouble attracting women. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a whole gang of girls," teammate Andre Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
William Thomas, Compton College sports information director, said Williams was 
serious about his future. 
</P>
<P>
"Roy is a victim too," Thomas said. "Both of these people are Compton's 
children. Both were young adults on their way through college, and both were 
trying to make something of themselves."

WILDFIRES IN 5 STATES FUEL FEAR OF DESTRUCTIVE SEASON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 220,000 acres have burned in five Western states since last week in 
what fire officials say is rapidly becoming one of the most destructive 
wildfire seasons of the century. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, more than 39,400 fires have blackened close to 1.4 million 
acres, according to Allan West, a U.S. Forest Service deputy chief in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's continuing to get worse," West said Thursday. "Long-range weather 
forecasts indicate continuing severe fire conditions, leaving this fire season 
with the potential to be as severe as last year's." 
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million acres burned across the nation in 1988 in what West 
described as the worst fire season since 1910. 
</P>
<P>
In California, firefighters bombed flames with fire retardant chemicals and lit 
backfires Thursday in an attempt to halt a 10,300-acre blaze in the Cleveland 
National Forest before it reaches the Eagle Crag nature sanctuary in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was burning rapidly through brush untouched by flames in more than 
100 years as it advanced toward the canyon sanctuary for bald eagles, spotted 
owls and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service officials said the Cleveland fire was 60% contained.

CITY IN COLORADO OKS NOISE-LEVEL CURBS ON ICE CREAM TRUCKS

The city has imposed decibel limits on amplified music-makers used by ice cream 
trucks to advertise their wares, saying noise is noise no matter what its 
cause, tune and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members voted, 7 to 2, this week for an ordinance that orders ice 
cream trucks to keep their music below 55 decibels, a limit also applied to 
parties and dirt bikes. The jingles have registered from 70 to 90 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
"Without music, we're not going to get any business," said Ice Cream Truck Inc. 
owner Joe Saurini, 52, who has three trucks playing amplified jingles. The 
tunes "have got to be so loud that people can hear you at least a block away, 
so that people can get ready to buy." 
</P>
<P>
"Citizens decided some time ago that (noise) is one of the things we are going 
to regulate heavily," city spokesman David Grimm said.

SKEPTICS OF RIVER ROAD BAIL OUT AT STORM DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is rush hour, 1995, and you are stuck in traffic on a new, limited access 
expressway in the Los Angeles River bed. It starts to rain, hard. Water begins 
to trickle down from the lip of a storm drain notched in the concrete river 
bank above you. You have five miles to go before the next exit. 
</P>
<P>
Relax, says Assemblyman Richard Katz. The rain will stay mainly in the drain. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, a Panorama City Democrat, has become the champion of the river-bottom 
expressway, one of the more novel approaches to traffic congestion to come down 
the pike in recent years. At a river's-edge press conference Thursday, Katz 
pictured a 30-mile road that would relieve adjacent freeways of 15% to 25% of 
their traffic load. 
</P>
<P>
As Katz envisions it, the expressway would operate in two segments -- a stretch 
reserved for buses, vans and car-poolers between the West San Fernando Valley 
and downtown, and a length running from downtown south to Long Beach for 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference near Griffith Park, Katz spoke with his back to the 
river which, even now in one of the driest months of the year, has enough flow 
to cover the bottom with a foot of water. Katz unveiled a detailed chart that 
showed three lanes of traffic capable of carrying 6,000 cars an hour. Below 
him, in the river channel, islands of pampas grass and willows stretched out of 
sight, around the bend north of the Fletcher Drive overpass. 
</P>
<P>
First, Katz talked about driver safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Flash-flooding has never been a problem in Los Angeles," Katz said. "We know 
enough about storms ahead of time to be able to avoid danger." Katz predicted 
that only during the wettest two weeks of the year would the expressway have to 
be closed. The rest of the time, water from storm drains or side channels would 
be sluiced through a trough that would run down the center of the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
Three lanes of traffic would pass on one side of the trough, protected by a 
10-foot wall. On the other side, a greenbelt would be planted, assuring that 
the plants and birds now living in the river bottom would be protected. Katz 
estimates the project would cost about $30 million a mile, a figure he said 
looks pretty good compared to the $300-million-a-mile cost projected for the 
first segment of the city's Metro Rail system. One reason the expressway would 
be comparatively cheap to build is that much of the riverbed already is paved. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said people could be driving down the riverbed by 1992 or 1993. He pointed 
out that driving already is permitted on portions of the riverbed -- bus 
companies teach new drivers and the California Highway Patrol trains 
motorcyclists there. 
</P>
<P>
The expressway proposal, which is under study by the L.A. County Transportation 
Commission, already is running into stiff opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Over Our Dead Bodies' 
</P>
<P>
"He'll build it over our dead bodies. The L.A. River is not a freeway," said 
Lewis MacAdams, co-founder of Friends of the Los Angeles River. MacAdams says 
the river's wildlife, including mallards, great blue herons and red-winged 
blackbirds, would be imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
MacAdams prefers Mayor Tom Bradley's plan for the river, which calls for 
turning it into a greenbelt complete with bike paths and riding trails. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said the riverbed freeway would create "havoc and 
mayhem." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think would happen on those rainy days when you couldn't drive in 
the riverbed? All that traffic dumped back on the freeways. I think you would 
shut them down," said Gage, a one-time white-water river guide. 
</P>
<P>
Katz is prepared for such hostility: "I know what people will say. 'There they 
go again in Southern California.' " 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman admitted that the idea is a bit "rough" at the moment, but he 
said it is an example of the kind of creative thinking needed to solve the 
region's transportation problems. And he encouraged people to write to him with 
any ideas they might have. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Skepticism 
</P>
<P>
Some of the skepticism over the expressway plan comes from people who are quite 
familiar with the river. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nichols, chief of the water conservation division of the Los Angeles County 
Public Works Department, said he is not sure how quickly or accurately experts 
can predict flash-flood conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We read the same forecasts you do. We do have a consultant in Goleta. Maybe, 
that gives us an edge," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are dozens and dozens of storm drains all along the river, as well as 
major channels. All of them spit water into the river," he said.

<P>
Added Nichols: "I don't see how you could do it (build the expressway) without 
major modifications that would somehow take the flows and reroute them." 
</P>
<P>
Before Katz spoke Thursday, Arthur Stuart, who works at a Department of Water 
and Power receiving station beside the river, made his skepticism known. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do with all that water?" Stuart asked. "I've seen it get 
10 feet high," he said, pointing out a water mark on the concrete bank. "I've 
seen cars floating down it."

7-YEAR-OLD SHOT DOWN IN WATTS; 
</P>
<P>
GIRL CRITICALLY WOUNDED BY BULLETS FIRED FROM CAR 
</P>

<P>
It was 7-year-old Kanita Haley's turn at bat. 
</P>
<P>
As the second-grader from Watts bent down to pick up a baseball bat, a car sped 
around a nearby corner, according to witnesses. A man pointed a gun out the 
passenger-side window, and the shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
Other children instinctively dove to the ground Wednesday night on the stretch 
of dirt and grass just inside the Imperial Courts housing project. But Kanita, 
just five days shy of her eighth birthday, panicked and ran. A bullet tore into 
her right temple. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center said Thursday that the 
girl was critically wounded and was being kept alive by life-support machines. 
Police believe she is yet another innocent victim of gang warfare and its 
savage toll of children and teen-agers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a 14-year-old boy was shot to death as he sat on a park picnic 
table in an unincorporated area of the city. And a 13-year-old in an unrelated 
incident was wounded as he stood on a street near Fremont High School. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning in Juvenile Court, a 13-year-old girl was convicted of the 
June 2 shooting death in South-Central Los Angeles of a 14-year-old girl. Two 
teen-age boys were convicted of the same charge in the slaying last February of 
an 11-year-old who had been walking from a store in the Pico-Union area with 
her aunt and sister. 
</P>
<P>
Last year 70 people 17 years of age or younger were the victims of homicide in 
Los Angeles alone. Police say most of the deaths appear to stem from animosity 
between warring gang factions. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, however, the intended targets go unscathed and the innocent 
die. And many of the innocent are young people like Kanita Haley, who happened 
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
In Kanita's case, the wrong place was a fenced yard within earshot of her own 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the gunman was traveling in a late-model 
beige-colored compact car with one other person, but no one had been arrested 
by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 8:30 p.m. near the corner of Mona Boulevard and 
115th Street, just as some Imperial Courts parents were getting ready to call 
their children in from the communal yard that separates the rows of two-story 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Coleman, 46, a longtime resident of the project, said that the impromptu 
baseball game had been going strong just outside her kitchen window for some 
time. She had just decided to turn off her porch light and end the game when at 
least six shots rang out. She hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman said the shooting continued the whole time she ran from her front 
door to her back door to admit her son, who was frantically trying to get 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old man said Thursday that the gunman appeared to have been shooting 
at him and a group of friends who had been standing outside the yard. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who did not want his name made public, said he turned and ran into the 
yard and dove to the ground. As bullets ricocheted off metal poles in the yard, 
he said, Kanita ran by. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into Line of Fire 
</P>
<P>
The man said he and another man tried to pull her to safety but the girl ran 
toward her own apartment. Her route took her into the middle of the yard and 
straight into the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kanita's mother, 26-year-old Myrtle Murray, spent most of the day 
keeping a grim vigil at the hospital. When she returned home, she spoke only 
briefly to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Kanita's 9-year-old sister, Sharrale, said that Murray brought her four 
children to California four years ago, but was planning to return to Indiana 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Kanita attended Grape Street Elementary School and brought home mostly A's and 
B's, her sister said. 
</P>
<P>
As Sharrale spoke to reporters, scores of other children and their parents 
stood nearby. Mothers shuddered and held toddlers close to them. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't even let them play in the yard. That's a shame," said one parent. 
"You can't even sit in a chair some nights when you're in your own house. The 
shooting gets so bad, you have to sit on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Fearful 
</P>
<P>
Most of the women said they will never let their children play outside at night 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Sutton, a longtime community activist, said later, however, that people 
cannot hide in their homes in fear. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great need for concern about the level of the violence that is 
permeating our cities," said Sutton, who works primarily with the Brotherhood 
Crusade, a support group for community-based agencies. "There appears to be a 
tolerance that stems from inertia, insensitivity or fear." 
</P>
<P>
Sutton said the only solution is for people to take to the streets and reclaim 
their neighborhoods. Such an action is planned this month and next in a 
110-square-block area of South-Central. It is being sponsored by the 
Brotherhood Crusade, which has enlisted the support of churches, grass-roots 
community groups and scores of individuals.

JURY ACQUITS EX-ASSISTANT CITY ATTY. OF LYING TO DMV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Assistant City Atty. Betsy Mogul, wife of an ex-Los Angeles police 
officer charged with two contract murders, was acquitted Thursday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court of a charge of lying on a Department of Motor Vehicle 
form to cheat the state out of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated for about four hours before finding Mogul, 41, not guilty of 
a single perjury count -- a charge that led to her dismissal from her 
$78,000-a-year post. She had been accused of falsely claiming on a DMV form in 
1983 that she bought a Mercedes-Benz car from her father to save about $600 in 
sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Mogul testified that she signed the form without reading it at the urging of 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say thank God for the jury system," Mogul said after the 
verdict. "Because of the experience I've had since my husband was arrested in 
1986, I have learned that the police and the prosecutors are petty, corrupt and 
venal politicians." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Husband Investigated 
</P>
<P>
The charge against Mogul, filed by the district attorney's office in February, 
1987, grew out of an investigation into alleged criminal activities by her 
husband, William Leasure, 42. The LAPD veteran of 18 years is charged with 
arranging two murders in 1980 and 1981 and with being involved in a statewide 
yacht theft ring. Mogul's lawyer, Robert Horner, contended after Thursday's 
verdict that police had sought the perjury charge against Mogul to pressure her 
into testifying against Leasure. 
</P>
<P>
"The police abuse is staggering," Horner said. "They threatened people. They 
tried to use any kind of force they could to get her terminated, and it worked 
because (City Atty.) Jim (James K.) Hahn is terrified of bad publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn fired Mogul in January, 1988. Mike Qualls, a city attorney spokesman, said 
at the time that Mogul was discharged "for conduct unbecoming an employee of 
this office" after she had been ordered to stand trial on a perjury charge. 
</P>
<P>
Horner, now in private practice in Beverly Hills, said he quit a $95,000-a-year 
post as Hahn's chief assistant to defend Mogul, whom he once supervised in the 
city attorney's office. He said Mogul has been virtually unemployed as a lawyer 
since she was fired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Called Error 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the city attorney would not force her into litigation about 
the job they took away for no reason," Horner said. "I hope that after this 
nightmare Mr. Hahn would rectify the error and give her her job back." 
</P>
<P>
City attorney's office officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Now that she has been acquitted, Mogul said, she plans to "turn my prayers and 
my efforts to seeing that my husband also gets justice. I believe he's 
innocent."

BRADLEY CALLS ON HIS ALLIES; 
</P>
<P>
LONGTIME ADVISERS INVITED TO DISCUSS PAYING LEGAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SAPPELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has summoned a select group of longtime advisers and expert 
fund-raisers for a Saturday morning summit at the mayoral mansion to discuss, 
among other things, how to pay the mounting legal bills generated by the 
biggest crisis of his political career. 
</P>
<P>
A top Bradley aide acknowledged Thursday that the mayor had called the rare 
meeting in Hancock Park and that the agenda would center on how to raise money 
for the newly formed Bradley Officeholder Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to confirm reports circulating through City Hall that the committee is 
simply a thinly disguised legal defense fund, Bradley's in-house lawyer, Mark 
Fabiani, would say only: "I think the possibility of using part of the 
officeholder account funds for legal services will be discussed on Saturday, as 
well as the means of raising funds." 
</P>
<P>
During the last four months, at least six public agencies have initiated 
inquiries into Bradley's personal stock dealings and whether he used his 
official position to steer taxpayer money to business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has employed three prestigious law firms to represent him in the 
inquiries -- experts in securities law, trial work and political strategy. 
Fabiani declined to say how much the defense team has billed the mayor, calling 
such information a "private matter." 
</P>
<P>
But one veteran supporter who is knowledgeable about attorney fees said: "I 
would guess that his legal fees are astronomical. They probably are already in 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the guest list, it appears that the five-term mayor has decided to 
tap his substantial pool of political alliances to see him through a 
controversy that he has for the most part endured alone and that has tarnished 
his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Among those invited to Getty House are advisers who in previous terms helped 
make Bradley one of the nation's most influential Democratic politicians. Some 
clearly were under the impression that they were being called upon for their 
judgment, not their money. Those contacted Thursday evening said they had not 
been told specifically of the meeting's purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Dan Garcia, formerly Bradley's head of the city Planning Commission, 
said he was told simply that it is going to be "a meeting of supporters of the 
mayor. I have no idea what it is about." 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Nikolas Patsaouras, a Bradley-appointed zoning commissioner and 
prominent Democratic Party fund-raiser, said the message he got from the 
mayor's office indicated only that a few people were being brought together for 
a "briefing on the present situation." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a genius to figure out what the present situation is," he said 
with a sense of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others on List 
</P>
<P>
The entire guest list could not be determined by late Thursday. But a few of 
the others said to be on it include former public works Commissioner Maureen 
Kindel, a lobbyist who is one of Bradley's closest advisers; Recreation and 
Parks Commissioner Dick Riordan, a developer with key links to the business 
community; Joseph Cerrell, a veteran political consultant; airport Commissioner 
Johnnie L. Cochran, a politically connected attorney, and longtime fund-raiser 
Bruce Corwin, treasurer of the new committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley Officeholder Committee was formed July 19 -- the day before an 
explosive city audit was made public, leading to an extraordinary week of 
public hearings by a City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
In the report and in public testimony it was revealed that someone in the city 
treasurer's office had "whited out" a notation that indicated a $2-million 
deposit in Far East National Bank had been made "per the mayor." Bradley had 
been a paid adviser to the bank. It was also disclosed that the document was 
doctored to create the false impression that a required competitive bidding 
procedure had been followed. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani, the mayor's counsel, said the committee can spend the funds not only 
on legal bills but on "any expenses" the mayor has incurred "in connection with 
his public service." Under the law, they cannot be used to pay off campaign 
debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such committees are a new phenomenon in the city and have "sort of slipped 
through" without any public scrutiny, said Walter Zelman, executive director of 
California Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hahn's Opinion Sought 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said he is concerned about their legality and has asked City Atty. James 
K. Hahn for an opinion. The mayor's office noted Thursday that Hahn himself has 
such a committee. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bradley has missed a mid-July deadline set by the California Fair 
Political Practices Commission to provide greater detail in his 1984 through 
1988 financial disclosure statements, FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC notified Bradley on June 23 that he had 20 days to revise the 
statements, which contain errors and omissions. 
</P>
<P>
But Fabiani said the FPPC has agreed to give the mayor's office more time 
because of the complexity of the undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say," he added, "is that the statements will be filed when they are 
ready."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LA FOLLETTE PROMISES SCHOOL DISTRICT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette said she will privately create a plan to 
break up the Los Angeles school district that she hopes to present to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Her strategy would bypass the state Legislature, where she has repeatedly been 
stymied on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette (R-Northridge) announced that she has created a five-member panel 
that will hold hearings in the summer and fall on how to accomplish the 
breakup. Called the Los Angeles Task Force for Better Education, it will hear 
from parents, students, educators and community leaders and will develop a plan 
to create as many as 15 districts out of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. The first hearing is scheduled for Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Such a reorganization plan would have to be endorsed by the State Board of 
Education and the Los Angeles County Committee on School District Organization. 
It would then have to be approved by voters.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY BEGINS DELIVERY OF RECYCLING BINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City of Los Angeles workers are delivering free yellow trash bins to thousands 
of homes over the next two weeks to expand its pilot recycling programs to all 
15 Los Angeles City Council districts. 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase of the program, called Recycle L.A., the containers will be 
dropped off in portions of eight council districts in Northeast Los Angeles and 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Special recycling trucks will begin weekly pickups a week after the initial 
delivery, said Gyl Elliott, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Sanitation. Residents 
will be asked to use the city containers for aluminum and steel cans, glass 
bottles and jars and clear plastic soda bottles. Newspapers, either tied or in 
shopping bags, can also be placed beside the containers at curbside. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion raises the number of homes participating in the city's voluntary 
recycling pilot program to 90,000. Elliott said the bureau plans to propose 
citywide mandatory recycling within 30 days.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOARD FOR POLICE REVIEW ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ballot proposal that would create a citizen review board to deal with 
complaints of police brutality and misconduct was approved this week by a key 
Long Beach City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
The action clears the way for the proposal to go before the full council, which 
must vote to put it on next April's ballot for a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which requires a change in the City Charter, would for the first 
time take the authority to investigate complaints of police brutality away from 
the Police Department and put it in the hands of an 11-member citizen board 
appointed by the mayor and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
By a 6-3 vote, the Charter Amendment Committee, on which all members of the 
council sit, approved a final version of the plan.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RENAMING OF STREET FOR KING DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynwood Mayor Pro Tem Paul Richards endeavored Thursday to deflect charges of 
racism leveled at black City Council members who approved the renaming of a 
major boulevard after Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Richards insisted that the decision to rename Century Boulevard after the slain 
civil rights leader was made according to proper governmental procedure. He 
said the five-member City Council, made up of three blacks and two whites, was 
unanimous in its decision to honor King by renaming a street. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the thinking of (the City Council) that this Nobel Peace Prize winner 
and American hero would be the perfect banner-carrier for unity in our city," 
Richards said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
In April, after the council voted 3 to 2 to rename the boulevard, a number of 
residents protested the decision. Lynwood, a predominantly black suburb 
southeast of Los Angeles, has been accused in the past of discriminating 
against whites and others in favor of blacks.

ROBERTS HELPS CARRY PADRES TO .500, NEARER CONTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Padres appear to slowly be creeping into this phenomenon called a 
pennant race, a peculiar thing is happening right before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The man they keep telling themselves is nothing more than a utility player, 
bringing in Chris James to take his spot in left field and Mike Pagliarulo to 
boot him out of third base, refuses to go away. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Leon Roberts. His friends call him "Bip." And it's becoming more 
apparent by the day that he just may be causing a snarl in the Padres' trade 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at shortstop once again ahead of Garry Templeton, Roberts was the 
catalyst behind the Padre offense Thursday in their 6-5 victory over the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who has not been a starting shortstop since high school, reached base 
four times -- two walks, a single and a double -- scored two runs, caused a 
throwing error and is as responsible as anyone for the Padres' victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeping the Braves for the first time at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium since 
Jimmy Carter was president (Sept. 7-9, 1979), the Padres reached the .500 mark 
(54-54) for the first time since June 7. They have won seven of their past nine 
and are within eight games of the NL West-leading Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the Braves are 43-65; all of a sudden, the Padres believe that 
they're back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the last three series is the best we've played in a long, long time," 
said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn, who went three for five with two RBIs. "At 
last, we're at .500. It looked like the climb we'd never make. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to make a move, this is the time." 
</P>
<P>
And who would have figured that the Padres would be making their move with 
Roberts at shortstop, leaving Templeton on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
When Roberts pulled a rib-cage muscle in the first series after the All-Star 
break against the Cubs, he was forced out of the lineup for 10 days. When he 
was ready to play, he found Pagliarulo at third and went back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get another shot until July 28, after Templeton suffered a strained 
tendon behind his left knee. Six days later, it doesn't appear he's about to 
give it up. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels strange," Roberts said. "I keep coming here looking to see my name 
with the extras, but there I am in the lineup. I've always been ready for that 
chance, and now it looks like I've got one. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I still don't consider myself a starting shortstop. There's a lot of 
things I don't know. I need experience, and that takes time. You just don't 
come out and be a Garry Templeton or Ozzie Smith." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is why the Padres have been adamant in their determination to 
acquire a shortstop. With Templeton's aging knees and Roberts' inexperience, 
they have spent an awful lot of hours on the telephone these past few months 
looking for one. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres in fact have had discussions right here with Braves General Manager 
Bobby Cox in an attempt to work out a three-team trade with the Cubs. They've 
talked about a deal that would send triple-A catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. to the 
Braves for infielder Jeff Blauser and an outfielder, and in turn would send 
Blauser to the Cubs for shortstop Shawon Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
It appears unlikely that the deal could be made until the Cubs drop out of the 
National League East race, but when the Cubs say the word, sources say, the 
deal could be consummated. 
</P>
<P>
That is unless the Padres suddenly change their minds. And the way Roberts is 
playing -- five for 13 in this series with four runs, raising his on-base 
percentage to .392 -- the Padres might be a little hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Jack (McKeon) just today," Templeton said, "if I had a couple of years 
to work with him, I think he could be one of the outstanding shortstops in this 
league. All he needs is experience, and he'll be a good one. There's no doubt 
in my mind that he can play." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is Garry Templeton talking. The man who for the time-being has lost 
his job. The man who tries to familiarize Roberts with the shortstop position, 
whether it's at lunch, on the field, on the bench, in the clubhouse or back at 
the team hotel at night. 
</P>
<P>
"Who am I to complain?" Templeton said. "The guy's doing a hell of a job. If we 
keep winning, he should stay right there. Why mess with a winning combination? 
</P>
<P>
"Sometime or another, you hit one one point in your career where you've got to 
help somebody out. Don Kessinger did it for me when I knew I was going to take 
his place, and now I'm doing it for Bip." 
</P>
<P>
Funny how winning spawns team unity. There was Carmelo Martinez getting two 
more hits while playing for injured Chris James (hip flexor), finishing the 
series five for 10 with five RBIs, and saying afterwards that if James is ready 
to play today, he'll gladly step aside. 
</P>
<P>
There was backup catcher Mark Parent going two for four with an RBI, and 
starter Benito Santiago patting him on the back in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
There was Mark Grant, retiring 11 of 12 batters he faced in relief of Don 
Schulze (2-0), and Mark Davis standing in the bullpen cheering for Grant to get 
the final out for his first save since 1987. Instead, Grant gave up three 
consecutive singles, and with the tying run on second, Davis was called upon to 
face Jeff Treadway. Davis struck him out on three pitches, recording his 
major-league high 28th save, extending his consecutive scoreless streak to 18 
innings and feeling disappointed about doing so. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing like a team again," Gwynn said, "and everyone's pulling their 
load. This is the first time I can say we're back in this thing, we're in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can just keep playing like we are, and get to within five or or four 
games by Sept. 1, look out." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Eric Show's back surgery Wednesday night, according to surgeon 
Dr. Roger Thorne, "could not have gone any better." Show had the fifth disk in 
the lumbar region of his back removed, along with three fragments that were 
pressing against the nerves. Show is expected to be released out of Scripps 
Clinic this weekend, and begin rehabilitation in 10 days. Show, who was placed 
on the 60-day emergency list, should be completely recovered in eight weeks, 
Thorne said.

MCCASKILL FINALLY GETS HELP IN ANGELS' 6-0 WIN AT SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1989 Angels may not make anyone forget Murderers' Row, but they certainly 
have been into some serious baseball-bashing this season. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while most of the Angel pitchers have had to worry more about getting 
stiff while their teammates slammed balls over the fence than about holding 
opponents at bay, Kirk McCaskill has frequently been victimized by a lack of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have scored a total of just 10 runs in his six losses. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night in the Kingdome, however, Angel batters provided plenty of 
offense, and McCaskill took care of the rest, throwing a seven-hit shutout to 
beat the Mariners, 6-0, before 12,584 fans. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, on the heels of Bert Blyleven's 7-0 win Wednesday night, marked 
the third time this season that Angel pitchers have had consecutive shutouts. 
It was also McCaskill's third shutout of the year, tying him with Blyleven and 
Boston's Roger Clemens for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
The win vaulted the Angels back into first place in the American League West, 
one-half game ahead of Oakland, which lost to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also got two more home runs, from somewhat unexpected sources -- 
Johnny Ray and Devon White, who each hit his first homer since June 24. The 
Angels have six players with nine or more home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think much of what you do in this game revolves around expectations," 
Manager Doug Rader said. "Whenever there are positive expectations, whether 
it's doing a good job on the mound or being able to score quickly from anywhere 
in the lineup, there's probably going to be success." 
</P>
<P>
During the first month of the season, there was nothing but great expectation 
regarding McCaskill (11-6). It seemed as if a run a game would be plenty for 
him as he jumped out to the best start of his career. 
</P>
<P>
In his first eight starts this season, he averaged almost eight innings per 
outing and was allowing fewer than one run a start. As a result, he was 5-1 
with a 1.06 earned-run average in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
However, he lost three starts in a row in June and has been somewhat 
inconsistent ever since. He even missed one start because of a tired arm, but 
he was the model of consistency after the first few innings Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making good pitches until I needed to get an out and then I made some 
real bonehead pitches," McCaskill said. "I was lucky to get out of a couple of 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill said the cortisone shot he received after coming out of a game in 
Baltimore on July 14 because of soreness in his elbow has made a world of 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known my arm would feel this good after the treatment," he said, "I 
would have done it two weeks earlier." 
</P>
<P>
Since receiving the injection, McCaskill has been more effective with each 
game. And he was getting better with each inning Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He was getting stronger as the game went on," catcher Bill Schroeder said. "He 
had really good control. He didn't throw hardly any pitches out over the plate. 
Blyleven was great last (Wednesday) night, but I think they hit more balls hard 
last night than tonight." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill worked the first five innings with no more than a 1-0 lead before the 
Angels scored three times in the sixth, when they sent nine batters to the 
plate and left the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield led off with a walk, and Ray lined a home run to left field, his 
third homer of the season and first away from Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, Tony Armas tripled to right-center, missing his ninth home run 
by just a few feet. Chili Davis lined a single to left to score Armas and give 
the Angels a 4-0 advantage. Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre decided that 6-foot-10 
starter Randy Johnson wasn't standing so tall anymore and summoned Bill Swift. 
</P>
<P>
Swift surrendered a double down the right-field line by Lance Parrish and 
walked Jack Howell intentionally to load the bases. But Schroeder grounded into 
a force-out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
White followed Schofield's second hit of the night with a home run to right 
field in the ninth, and the Angels were coasting. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirk should be very pleased with the way he pitched tonight," Rader said. 
"We're all aware of his tired-arm situation, and every time he demonstrates 
this kind of arm strength, he re-establishes that in his own mind, which is 
most important." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners had two doubles and a single in the first three innings, and came 
away without a run after getting three singles in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Davis led off the inning with a single to right. Jeffrey Leonard followed 
with single up the middle, and one out later, Mike Kingery lined a shot to left 
to load the bases. But McCaskill struck out Jim Presley and got David Valle to 
pop up to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
After that, McCaskill kept gaining momentum and retired the last 11 Mariners in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who blew a 5-0 lead Monday night and rolled over in an 8-1 defeat 
Tuesday night, have two lopsided victories in a row and seem to be back on a 
roll again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our resiliency can be attributed to strong people who can perform when 
things get tough," Rader said. "And there are a lot of people contributing, not 
just the guys throwing the shutouts." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when you're trying to rebound from a couple of very disheartening 
losses, there's nothing like a bunch of zeros going up on the scoreboard for 
the oher team, inning after inning, to make you feel a whole lot better. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish, who missed Wednesday night's game because of a slightly 
hyperextended left knee, was back in the lineup as the designated hitter 
Thursday. "I'm going to go out there and put on a base-stealing exhibition like 
you've never seen, just to show you I can do it," Parrish said, when asked how 
his knee felt. "Seriously, you never know how well it is until you test it, but 
not having to squat should help. I just want to give it a break, so hopefully 
it will come around a little quicker." . . . Claudell Washington, who has been 
hampered by a sore shoulder blade lately, got the night off. "It's been 
bothering me for about four days," Washington said, "but it's nothing that 
would keep me out of the game. (Manager Doug Rader) just decided to give me a 
day off. It's a little knot in the muscle that bothers me when I swing the bat 
and when I throw off-balance." 
</P>
<P>
Broadcaster Bob Starr, who does the play-by-play of Angel games for KTLA 
(Channel 5), will miss three games during the next trip because of a commitment 
to do Ram radio broadcasts. Joe Torre, who normally does the commentary, will 
do the play-by-play, and two former Angels will do the color. On Aug. 21, Bobby 
Grich will join Torre for the telecast from Kansas City. And on Aug. 26, Reggie 
Jackson will do the commentary for the game in Texas. A substitute for the 
Sept. 2 game in New York has not yet been named. . . . Catcher Bill Schroeder 
is anxious to get to Milwaukee, where his daughter, Lindsey, remains in a 
suburban hospital with a severe ear infection. "She's not getting better as 
fast as they thought she would," Schroeder said before the game. "I just wish 
we could get this game over with and get on that plane." . . . The Angels flew 
to Milwaukee directly after the game and were due to arrive about 6 a.m. 
Pitchers Chuck Finley, who starts tonight, and Mike Witt, who will pitch 
Saturday night, left Thursday, ahead of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the Angels traded their 1986 No. 1 draft pick, Roberto Hernandez, and 
outfielder Mark Doran, the No. 1 pick in 1983, to the Chicago White Sox for 
center-fielder Mark Davis and a player to be named. Davis was hitting .259 at 
Birmingham, a White Sox double-A affiliate. Hernandez was with the Angels' 
Class A Palm Springs team and Doran was at Class A Quad City.

DODGERS' 6-3 VICTORY CAPS OFF A ROUGH DAY FOR GIANT ROOKIE SWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was not in rookie pitcher Russ Swan's dreams. Not even his bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled from triple-A Phoenix to help rescue the sickly San Francisco Giants 
pitching staff, Swan was racing to catch a morning plane to Los Angeles 
Thursday when he was pulled over by a policeman. He was handed a speeding 
ticket for going 57 m.p.h. in a 45-m.p.h. zone. When he finally reached the 
airplane, his seat had been filled. 
</P>
<P>
"It was insane," Swan said. "I get called up to the big leagues, and I can't 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Swan caught the next flight, reassured by a television report that said he 
wouldn't start for the Giants until Saturday. He arrived at Dodger Stadium for 
Thursday night's game at 5:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants met him with a smile, then told him not to believe everything he 
heard on television. They told him he was starting in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk in the dugout, and (Manager) Roger (Craig) says, 'Hurry up,' and I 
said, 'What?' " Swan recalled. "When they called me up, I didn't even know 
whether I would be a starter or a reliever. And now I'm starting. It was a 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
His shock, not to mention his problems with speed, were just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Staked to a 3-0 lead on Kevin Mitchell's 34th homer in the first inning, Swan's 
major league debut was bombed by Dodger feet and bats in a 6-3 Los Angeles 
victory before a crowd of 43,516 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Swan gave up an unearned run in the third inning when Jose Gonzalez sprinted 
all the way home from first base on a five-foot bunt and an error. 
</P>
<P>
Swan was hit for four more runs in the fourth on Eddie Murray's first triple of 
the season, a two-run shot, and Mike Marshall's seventh homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the adrenaline going, but it was a weird day," said Swan, 25. "I don't 
know what I was thinking." 
</P>
<P>
His uncertainty was all the Dodgers needed to win their second straight game 
from the National League West leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers moved within 11 1/2 games of first place. Athough they are still 
tied with Cincinnati for fourth, this is closer than they've been since July 
14. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like our chances, but I think there's still a chance," said winning 
pitcher Orel Hershiser, noting there are still nine games remaining between the 
Dodgers and Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if we can take two out of three from them in two more series, and then 
sweep another one, we could get back in it. But then you never know what 
Houston and San Diego are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser was coming off a bout with the flu that caused him to miss 
Wednesday's game. Interestingly, the last time he missed a day with the flu, 
July 17, he pitched a four-hitter against Chicago the next night. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Giants, he scattered seven hits over seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
After the first inning, during which Mitchell's homer followed singles by Ken 
Oberkfell and Will Clark, Hershiser retired 17 of his final 21 batters. He 
improved his record to 13-8, and he is on a second-half roll. In six starts 
since the All-Star break, Hershiser has gone 5-1 with a 2.25 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The losing pitcher was Swan. He had started the season at double-A Shreveport 
before being recalled to Phoenix, where he went 3-3 with a 2.49 ERA. He was 
hurried to the big leagues Thursday because of disabling injuries to starters 
Rick Reuschel and Atlee Hammaker. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't allow a hit in the first two innings. But he gave up his first major 
league single to Gonzalez leading off the third. Then he got his first taste of 
major league trouble. 
</P>
<P>
One out after Gonzalez's hit, Hershiser successfully bunted him to second base. 
But Gonzalez, perhaps the fastest Dodger, was not content with just second. He 
crossed the bag and headed for an uncovered third base without breaking stride. 
</P>
<P>
Flustered second baseman Oberkfell threw the ball to an equally flustered 
shortstop Jose Uribe, who was trying to beat Gonzalez to the bag. The race 
didn't matter when Oberkfell threw the ball into left field. Gonzalez scored 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
Such speed is uncommon around these parts, considering that the Dodgers entered 
the night ranked 10th in the league in stolen bases and 11th in triples. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to pick it up, to get people going," Gonzalez said. "Sometimes the 
other team sleeps, you never know. I see nobody on third and look at the guy 
covering second and I think, I can beat him to third." 
</P>
<P>
Murray also showed some of that speed in the fourth inning, stealing his third 
base of the year. However, Murray has been most overwhelming with his hitting 
lately. He has eight hits in his last 23 at-bats (.348) with three homers and 
11 RBIs, putting him among league leaders with 64 RBIS. 
</P>
<P>
Thurday's win was nailed down, as usual, by Jay Howell, who gained his second 
save in two nights and 22nd save of the season with two scoreless innings. He 
has allowed one run in his last 26 1/3 innings and overall has yielded just 
five runs in 57 1/3 innings for an 0.78 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels missed his second straight start in left field and will undergo a 
testing today on his right knee, which was surgically repaired in May. Losing 
Daniels would be a big blow to the Dodgers, as he has hit in nine of 11 games 
since joining the team from Cincinnati, going 13 for 38 (.342) with two homers 
and eight RBIs. . . . San Francisco starter Atlee Hammaker, who was carried 
from the field on a stretcher Wednesday after spraining his knee on a slide at 
second base, will undergo arthroscopic surgery this weekend. He will miss at 
least four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos visited Dodger Stadium Thursday night to research 
ideas for a new downtown stadium, which he formally proposed last week to 
replace Candlestick Park. "We have talked about a 30-year stadium lease, and 
some people think that 30 years is the life expectancy of a stadium, but look 
at this place," Agnos said of Dodger Stadium. "This place is 28 years old and 
it's so nice, you can eat off the aisles. The Giants wanted me to see this 
place so I could speak with authority and passion about what a baseball stadium 
should be like." Agnos said that his idea for a stadium, which will be brought 
to a public vote in November, includes a right-field fence bordering San 
Francisco Bay. Home runs could land in the water. "I told Will Clark we would 
change his nickname to 'Will the Spill,' " Agnos said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, reflecting on his 2,000th game as the Dodgers' manager Wednesday, 
said: "I could hardly believe it when somebody mentioned it to me," Lasorda 
said. "To be around that long, I could not have done it without a good boss. 
Thank God for the O'Malleys."

ABBOTT HELPS KIDS EXPLORE POTENTIAL OF INNER STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember, our handicaps are only problems in the eyes of others. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JIM ABBOTT, in a letter to Laura Small 
</P>
<P>
Born without a right hand, he proved the naysayers wrong and has already won 
nine games as a major league pitcher in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Mauled by a mountain lion near San Juan Capistrano when she was 5, she is still 
struggling to overcome the partial paralysis and facial scarring that resulted 
from the 1987 attack and hopes someday to become an eye doctor. 
</P>
<P>
As far apart as they now stand in their aspirations, Angel pitcher Jim Abbott 
and El Toro schoolgirl Laura Small share several traits: A gritty determination 
to conquer what others term disabilities and an intense desire not to be 
considered special. 
</P>
<P>
It was this bond of understanding that brought the two together through 
correspondence in June, when Laura, 8, sent a handwritten note to her baseball 
hero, and he quickly reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 5, I got attacked by a mountain lion here in Orange conty," Laura 
wrote in large, printed letters to the man who had displaced Wally Joyner as 
her favorite ballplayer. "I can't use my right hand and most of my right side 
is paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I think you're a great baseball Player. My brother David is 12 and is in 
love with baseball. He will turn green if you write back. I want to become a 
doctor, and seeing you makes me think I can be what I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
The response came only days later. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember hearing about your terrible accident from my home in Michigan," 
Abbott wrote. "I can also recall hearing some tremendous stories of how you 
have handled things since. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me when I say it's a tremendous privilege having someone look up to 
you at such a young age. You said in your letter you'd like to become a doctor. 
If you believe that now and work on it in the years to come, there's no reason 
you can't. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play baseball when I was growing up. The only people who may have 
doubted that possibility were those who couldn't accept that my handicap was 
not a hindrance. Remember, our handicaps are only problems in the eyes of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
When Abbott earned a spot on the Angels' pitching staff this year, he was 
thrust into the national spotlight, in large part because of his physical 
condition. But he has shunned that attention, seeking fame only for his 
pitching abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, Abbott has met and corresponded with handicapped children across the 
country who look to him for inspiration in breaking through what can appear to 
be insurmountable limits. It is a part of his life that he prefers not to 
discuss publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mead, the Angels' director of public relations, said: "It's incredible the 
number of letters he gets from handicapped kids; easily over a hundred (this 
season). And he's met with probably 45 or so of them when the team's on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"But he really wants to downplay it. He's not doing it for the publicity. He's 
doing it to help these kids." 
</P>
<P>
As eager as she is to meet Abbott, Laura said the words of his letter alone 
were enough to boost her occasionally sagging spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a lot in common," she said at her El Toro home. 
</P>
<P>
Laura said she felt bad for Abbott because of all the attention given in sports 
pages across the country to his physical condition and the unique way in which 
he throws the ball with his left hand, then quickly prepares to field by 
slipping his fingers into a glove tucked under his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I really understood," Laura said of the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
As difficult as some of the challenges ahead appear, Laura and her family said 
it is her continual identification as "the little girl attacked by the mountain 
lion" that can be most frustrating for her. 
</P>
<P>
Having undergone 13 operations in the last three years, Laura has made a 
remarkably speedy recovery since the attack, her parents said. Undergoing 
regular physical therapy, she now takes ballet classes, participates almost 
fully in physical education at school and sports a potent, one-handed swing at 
wiffleball. 
</P>
<P>
However, Laura said some schoolchildren tease her about her condition. Comments 
from well-meaning people drawing attention to the attack can upset her. 
</P>
<P>
And she was vehemently opposed at first to the idea of talking to a reporter 
for yet another account of her story. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of being special!" she screamed at her mother. "I just want to be 
ordinary! 
</P>
<P>
And she said later: "It's like Jim said. You're not really handicapped, but 
other people think you are."

MORNING BRIEFING: HE TOLD NEW BOSS TO START BOSSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Finks, general manager of the New Orleans Saints and the man some owners 
would have as next commissioner of the National Football League, has been 
characterized as likable but direct. 
</P>
<P>
Finks was general manager of the Chicago Bears when owner George Halas died. 
The chairman of the board was Ed McCaskey, Halas' son-in-law. According to 
Brian Schmitz of the Orlando Sentinel, the two had a meeting a few days after 
the funeral and the conversation went like this: 
</P>
<P>
McCaskey: "What are we going to do now?" 
</P>
<P>
Finks: "You're an owner. Own." 
</P>
<P>
Add Bears: Said punter Maury Buford after being reacquired by the Bears when he 
was released by the Green Bay Packers: "To quote a saying from my all-time 
favorite TV show, 'Andy Griffith,' I'm as happy as a gopher in soft dirt to be 
back with the Bears and be able to see these guys again." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the first commissioner of the National Football League? 
</P>
<P>
You figure it: According to Jayson Stark of the Philadelphia Inquirer, 
Baltimore reliever Kevin Hickey switched from No. 23 to No. 45 after the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
"It's closer to my age," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Hickey is 33. So 23 is closer. 
</P>
<P>
"It is?" Hickey said. "Maybe that's why I got an F in math." 
</P>
<P>
Bengal blues: How bad is it for the Detroit Tigers? "I doubt even my mother is 
still reading the box scores," Manager Sparky Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
Add Sparky: Some observers believe he's lost some of his ebullience since 
taking an enforced rest, but Tiger General Manager Bill Lajoie said we might be 
seeing the real Sparky. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling when he and Anderson roomed together in the Venezuela winter league 
in the 1960s, Lajoie told the New York Times: "Back then, Sparky was a quiet 
man. Over the course of time, with all the winning, he developed a style that 
wasn't really him. I don't want this to come out wrong, but what I mean is with 
all his success and attention, he developed as an actor to fit the times. He 
went along with all the hype. Now, I think you're seeing Sparky closer to what 
he used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Holding out: Patrick Reusse of the Star Tribune in Minneapolis concedes that Bo 
Jackson has become a force in baseball but says of his footballing, "Take away 
one spectacular game on national television and Jackson has been a complete 
flop with the Raiders. Jackson has shown the same tendency with the Raiders 
that he had at Auburn. When the going is particularly tough, when a team is 
geared to pound him, Bo will develop a convenient muscle pull." 
</P>
<P>
Identity crisis: David Raymond, who plays the Phillie Phanatic at Veterans 
Stadium in Philadelphia, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that when Steve Sax was 
with the Dodgers they became such good friends that Sax would call him by his 
real name. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve would come up to me and say, 'Hey, Dave, what's going on? How's the 
family?' " said Raymond. "Then one time I came up to him in street clothes and 
he didn't know who the hell I was." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jim Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Manager Roger Craig of the San Francisco Giants on first baseman 
Will Clark: "I once was careful about comparing him to Stan Musial. I'm not 
anymore."

AUSTIN REQUIRES STITCHES IN HER ARMS, LEGS AFTER CAR IS STRUCK IN NEW JERSEY

<P>
Two-time U.S. Open singles champion Tracy Austin, who plays for the New Jersey 
Stars of TeamTennis, suffered minor injuries Thursday morning when her car was 
struck by another car at an intersection in Short Hills, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jeff Austin, her brother, the accident occurred when she was 
attempting to make a left turn on a green light and was struck by the other 
car. She was the only person in her car and had her seat belt fastened, he 
said. The accident took place close to the hotel where the Stars were staying. 
</P>
<P>
Austin, 26, was brought to the emergency room of Overlook Hospital in Summit, 
N.J., at 11 a.m., EDT, hospital President Michael Sniffen said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Austin, who also is her agent, said that several stitches were needed to 
close cuts on his sister's arms and legs but that she suffered no broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Schreck said that she would remain hospitalized overnight for 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, at 16, Austin became the youngest player ever to win the U.S. Open. 
She has limited herself to doubles play in recent months because of a foot 
injury suffered last April.

SAN DIEGO TENNIS TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN GRAF IS SURPRISED BY EASE OF 6-0, 6-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shock was not that top-ranked Steffi Graf won another match, 6-0, 6-0. The 
shock was whom she did it against. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a first-round opponent. This was Claudia Kohde-Kilsch, once ranked 
as high as fourth in the world and, until Graf came along, the leading woman 
tennis player in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, in the quarterfinals Thursday of the Great American Bank 
tournament at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club, was quick and 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Kohde-Kilsch could not hide her disbelief. Never in her 10-year career, she 
said, had she been shut out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not embarrassing," she said. "People who saw the match know how 
unbelievably she played. It's just hard for myself. It is not possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good feeling about the match. I had two good matches (in the 
tournament). I had practiced very well. It's not that I am off or something. I 
tried until the last ball. I really never thought I would lose 6-love, 6-love. 
But she played without any mistakes and so powerful." 
</P>
<P>
Even Graf was surprised by the ease with which she eliminated seventh-seeded 
Kohde-Kilsch, whose ranking has dropped to 30th after she took 2 1/2 months off 
for a rest earlier this spring. "She is a very good serve-and-volley player and 
also is someone who can play from the back," Graf said. "She has been in the 
top 10 for a long time. She always has had a very good ranking. I expected a 
much more difficult match." 
</P>
<P>
The match lasted 42 minutes. Graf allowed Kohde-Kilsch only 22 points in the 
match, eight in a first set that took 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In winning three matches to advance to the semifinals Saturday against the 
winner of today's Ann Grossman-Bettina Bunge match, Graf has lost two games (to 
Betsy Nagelsen in the second round) and her matches have averaged 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it fast again?" Graf said after being told of the match time. "Oh, no. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Graf's 10th in a row over Kohde-Kilsch since she dropped their 
first two matches in 1984. At the time, Graf was a 14-year-old, second-year 
professional, and Kohde-Kilsch, then 20, was ranked in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
The last time they played, in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 
January, Graf at least surrendered five games in a 6-2, 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I had more chances to come in and do something that time," Kohde-Kilsch said. 
"I got her to miss a few forehands. (This time) she was just so confident. She 
didn't miss anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what else I could have done. Maybe hit two or three more volleys, 
but she is so quick. . . . There was nothing much else I could do." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling of helplessness is something many sense against Graf. Her 
first-round opponent, Rene Simpson of Toronto, said after her 6-0, 6-0 loss 
Monday that she entered the match without hope of winning. But Simpson is 
ranked 80th in the world; Kohde-Kilsch has won $1.9 million as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see she was nervous," Graf said. "I know she can play much better. She 
is making double faults, sometimes at inappropriate points. You don't want to 
win 6-0, 6-0 against someone you know so well. It is difficult to know how to 
react afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kohde-Kilsch: "If you think about it yourself, you don't know what you did 
wrong and what you did right. But my family is here, and they told me, 'You 
couldn't do more. She played unbelievable. You are still a good player. If she 
plays this great, just forget about it. Think of the next match.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is Graf's first since her Wimbledon victory July 9. It is part 
of her hardcourt warmup for the U.S. Open at the end of the month. She is 
skipping the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles next week and will play in Mahwah, 
N.J., after that. But her first three matches in San Diego have given her 
little chance to test her skills.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: KABC TO BRING BACK BIELER AFTER FIRING HIM 13 YEARS 
AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed (Superfan) Bieler, fired by KABC radio in 1976, is returning to the station. 
And the man who fired him, George Green, the station's general manager, is the 
man bringing him back. 
</P>
<P>
Bieler will start in October, and his contract calls for him to be on the air 
20 hours a week. Details have yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Program director John Rook said: "We don't want to say too much because we 
don't want to let our competitors know what we're planning. But Ed is going to 
be a major player." 
</P>
<P>
Bieler says he works alone. So what will become of current "Sportstalk" host 
Fred Wallin? 
</P>
<P>
Green would say only: "Fred will continue to be a part of the KABC team." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so long ago that Green was saying he would never hire Bieler back, 
that Bieler was entertaining but irresponsible. Bieler essentially was fired by 
Green because of too many threatened lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
But the almighty ratings changed Green's thinking. The station's experiment 
with a general talk show done by Wink Martindale and Bill Smith hasn't gone 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the franchise on sports talk for years, and we want to go back to it," 
Green said. "Of the parade of people who have hosted that show, Bieler got the 
best ratings. I was the sales manager here when Ed first started (in 1973) and 
he was an easy sale. He had widespread appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Green's interest in Bieler was rekindled about two months ago when he heard 
that the ABC radio station in Chicago, WLS, was trying to lure Bieler from 
Kansas City's KCMO. 
</P>
<P>
Green contacted Bieler, who was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I had written a lot of letters to George Green, hoping someday 
to return," Bieler said from Kansas City, where he will continue to work until 
Sept. 1. "Finally, I gave up, figuring it would never happen." 
</P>
<P>
It's a strange business. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a little less of Brent Musburger on CBS this fall. Musburger, 
cutting back on his schedule because he will be his network's lead play-by-play 
man on baseball next season, is giving up college football. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Nantz will move out of the studio to replace Musburger and work with Pat 
Haden. Greg Gumbel will move into Nantz's studio role. 
</P>
<P>
The latest on Joel Meyers' move to NBC-TV as a pro football announcer is that 
KMPC probably, but reluctantly, will let him out of the two-year contract he 
signed three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers has told KMPC management he would like to continue as the host of the 
weeknight "Sportsline" talk show, but it's unlikely he will be allowed to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Costas and Dick Enberg were instrumental in getting Meyers the NBC offer. 
It's a good sign for Meyers that NBC wants to pair him with Paul Maguire, a 
very good commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire was received well by the public when he worked for NBC in the 1970s but 
was fired by then-executive producer Don Ohlmeyer, who said he simply needed to 
make room for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire spent six years with ESPN before returning to NBC three seasons ago to 
work on the pro football pregame show. Now he is going back to commentating. 
</P>
<P>
If, as expected, Meyers does go to NBC, KMPC will have to scramble to find a 
new UCLA play-by-play announcer. A top candidate is Chris Roberts, who has done 
Cal State Long Beach football and basketball the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket and Tom Kelly are reportedly close to making a deal, meaning KNX 
is in the market for a new USC play-by-play man. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Marotta, a solid all-around announcer, is one candidate. Pete Arbogast, 
who works for KNX and is the backup Clipper play-by-play man, is another 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said it was going to streamline its "NFL Live" pregame show by cutting back 
on the cast. But the network has added Bobby Beathard, former general manager 
of the Washington Redskins, and writer Ralph Wiley of Sports Illustrated to do 
a weekly "Insiders" report, and "Today" correspondent Mike Leonard to file a 
weekly off-beat feature. 
</P>
<P>
Things are starting to get congested again. Who's next, Vanna White? 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sports packager Roy Englebrecht and King announcer Bob Miller are 
putting on their annual week-long sportscasters camp at Loyola Marymount, 
beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 130 or so campers will be Loyola basketball star Hank Gathers, who 
already is looking ahead to his post-playing days. 
</P>
<P>
Englebrecht said there are still a few spots open. The cost is $695. For 
further information call (714) 760-3131. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC hired Englebrecht and Miller to work with Angel announcer Ken Brett during 
the last two off-seasons. One thing they did was take Brett to a Clipper game 
so he could announce it for practice and work on showing enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing like a Clipper game to stir one's enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
It was good to hear Don Drysdale back on the air Thursday. The Dodger announcer 
had been out for a couple of weeks after undergoing surgery to correct an 
artery blockage. . . . During the NBC telecast of the 5:15 Dodger-San Francisco 
Giant game Tuesday night, a graphic showed that Eddie Murray is a far better 
hitter in day games than night games. Taking note of the graphic, Vin Scully 
asked Tom Seaver: "Since this is a twilight game, what will Eddie do?" Replied 
Seaver: "That means he'll play well for 4 1/2 innings, then bad for 4 1/2." . . 
. KFI is dropping its weekend sports talk show and will have sports talk only 
on Sundays, from 8 p.m. to midnight. Joe McDonnell will be the host. Chris 
Roberts, who had been the host of the weeknight show, will stay on with KFI and 
sister station KOST as a sports anchor and reporter. . . . Word is the Raiders 
aren't pleased that KFI, their flagship station, is cutting back on sports 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel has made a deal with the Rams to carry their three home 
exhibition games on a one-day tape delay and also to carry a Ram highlight show 
for 20 weeks. Prime Ticket, according to spokeswoman Lori Gutknecht, passed on 
the package. . . . The Rams' first exhibition game, to be played in Toyko 
against the San Francisco 49ers, will be televised on both ESPN and Channel 11 
Saturday night at 7, with ESPN announcers Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Starr, Ram radio play-by-play announcer, didn't make the trip to Tokyo 
because of Angel TV commitments. Joel Meyers will fill in, working on the KMPC 
broadcast with Jack Youngblood, now the lone Ram radio commentator. Dick Bass, 
after 12 seasons, did not have his contract renewed. . . . Channel 11 will have 
a special Ram pregame show Saturday night at 6:30 with sports anchor Rick 
Garcia. Speaking of Garcia, he is often overlooked, but he's solid and can be 
clever. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5's weekend sports wrap- up shows, anchored by Ed Arnold and produced 
by Chris Lee, have been getting impressive ratings lately. Last Saturday 
night's Channel 5 wrap-up show drew a 4.7 Nielsen rating, Channel 7's a 3.9 and 
Channel 2's a 3.3. Channel 4 does not have a Saturday night sports wrap-up 
show. . . . The Sunday night Nielsens: Channel 4, 6.5; Channel 5, 3.7; Channel 
7, 2.2, and Channel 2, also a 2.2. Of course Channel 5 has the advantage of 
having its wrap-up shows on earlier than the network stations. 
</P>
<P>
Look-a-likes: Channel 4's Fred Roggin and actor Bob Saget, star of the hit ABC 
sitcom, "Full House." In fact, Saget used to play a sportscaster, but he said 
his role was changed because a lot of people noticed the similarity between him 
and Roggin. Saget now plays a TV talk-show host. . . . Bill MacDonald, who has 
been working for Prime Ticket as a free-lancer the past three years, has signed 
a contract with the the cable network that calls for him to serve in both host 
and play-by-play capacities. . . . Channel 9, the Laker station, will televise 
a one-hour Dodger special Sunday night at 6. But this show is about the Greats 
Falls (Mont.) Dodgers. It was produced by Channel 9's news department.

NEWSWIRE: ROSE'S LAWYERS WILL APPEAL RULING KEEPING LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose's lawyers said Thursday in Cincinnati that they will appeal the 
decision to keep Rose's suit against baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers want the case returned to Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in 
Cincinnati, where Judge Norbert A. Nadel issued a temporary restraining order 
June 25. The order prevented Giamatti from conducting a hearing on gambling 
allegations involving the Cincinnati Reds' manager. 
</P>
<P>
The case was transferred to federal court July 5 at the request of baseball's 
lawyers. On Monday, U.S. District Judge John Holschuh of Columbus denied Rose's 
motion to return the case to the state court system.

Rose's lawyers said they will appeal Holschuh's order next week in the 6th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Holschuh said there was "substantial 
ground for difference of opinion" on the jurisdiction questions and allowed for 
immediate appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball agreed that no action will be taken against Rose until an issue of 
jurisdiction is decided. On Monday, Holschuh extended that agreement until Aug. 
14, when he has scheduled a hearing on Rose's request for a preliminary 
injunction against Giamatti.

GREEN SEES RED BEFORE YANKEES' WIN OVER TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Dallas Green of the New York Yankees, responding to a published report, 
defended himself and his coaches against criticism from owner George 
Steinbrenner Thursday in New York before the Yankees defeated the Minnesota 
Twins, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
"My boss chooses to use the newspapers instead of a face-to-face confrontation, 
and I don't think that's fair," Green said in a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's the owner and he can say whatever he wants. I may not like it. But I 
don't have to like it. I just have to do the best that I can as long as I can." 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's editions of the New York Daily News, a day after the Yankees 
split a doubleheader with the Twins, Steinbrenner was quoted as saying, "From 
what I saw tonight, the managers and coaches are going to have to do a better 
job for us to win." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner criticized Green's placement of Yankee outfielders and offensive 
strategy in the team's 4-3 loss in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
"What manager George made was a logical second guess," Green said. "But 
hindsight is always 20-20, and is also what gives managers gray hair. I guess 
you could say, 'Consider the source,' and take it from there. If he's using 
this as a motivational tool, he's wasting his time. No one on this team can 
work any harder." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Chuck Cary pitched a five-hitter for his second consecutive complete 
game, and the Yankees hammered Rick Aguilera in his debut with the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilera, acquired from the New York Mets in the Frank Viola trade Monday, gave 
up 10 hits and six runs in four-plus innings. It was his first start since July 
9, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Cary, who pitched 16 consecutive scoreless innings before Greg Gagne homered in 
the ninth, struck out five and walked none. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia drove in three runs and Mel Hall had three of the Yankees' 15 
hits. Hall hit an RBI single in the first inning and made it 2-0 in third when 
he and Jesse Barfield hit consecutive doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Oakland 4 -- Ron Karkovice's first triple in 418 career at-bats 
broke a sixth-inning tie, and the Chicago White Sox ended Oakland's four-game 
winning streak at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs in the sixth, Karkovice's drive off the fence in right-center 
scored Dan Pasqua to give the White Sox a 5-4 lead. Pasqua started the inning 
with a walk off Bob Welch. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox scored in the seventh when Ivan Calderon singled, stole second 
and scored as Greg Walker beat out an infield hit. He knocked the ball out of 
catcher Terry Steinbach's glove for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Toronto 0 -- Tom Gordon pitched a three-hitter for his first 
career shutout and complete game, and Danny Tartabull went 3 for 4 with an RBI 
single at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon (12-5), a rookie, struck out eight and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff singled in the second and doubled in the eighth, and Kelly Gruber 
singled in the seventh for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Key (7-13) lost his seventh consecutive decision, giving up three runs, 
three hits and four walks in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, Boston 2 -- Rod Nichols beat the Red Sox for the second time in a 
week, and Cory Snyder drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, who edged the Red Sox, 2-1, in Cleveland Friday, gave up 10 hits in 
seven-plus innings, including Nick Esasky's two-run homer in the eighth. 
Nichols earned his third major league victory when Doug Jones got the last six 
outs for his 25th save. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 9, Texas 6 -- Alan Trammell's second RBI single broke a tie in the 
eighth inning, and the Tigers won at Detroit in a game with 16 walks. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Henneman (8-4) worked the last 2 2/3 innings to win. Cecilio Guante, the 
fourth of five Texas pitchers, lost. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Heath opened the eighth with a single and Gary Pettis walked. After Kenny 
Rogers relieved Guante with a 2-0 count on Trammell, the count went to 3-2 
before Trammell singled, scoring Heath with the go-ahead run.

BARROWMAN REVIVES WITH A WORLD RECORD IN 200 BREASTSTROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer

<P>
Mike Barrowman was disappointed with his performance in the 1988 Olympic Games 
at Seoul. So disappointed, in fact, that he couldn't bring himself to look at 
the videotape of his swim until April. His fourth-place finish, out of medal 
contention, looked as bad as he remembered it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw that, and I saw the man that I had trained with every day being 
that disappointed, I said, 'I've got to do something about that,' " Barrowman 
said Thursday morning after breaking the world record in a preliminary heat of 
the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming long course national championships. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman's world mark of 2 minutes 12.90 seconds in the 200-meter breaststroke 
was the first in this meet, the premier U.S. event of the season. It was also 
the first world record set this year. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman, 20, will be a junior this fall at the University of Michigan. He is 
swimming here for the Curl-Burke Swim Club near his home in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Although Barrowman had set a U.S. record, 2:13.74, in the University of Texas 
pool last summer during the Olympic trials and had tied it in the finals, he 
had never held a world record. 
</P>
<P>
The record that he broke Thursday morning of 2:13.34 was set by Victor Davis of 
Canada when he won the Olympic gold medal in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Barrowman broke the record in the same lane of the pool on the USC 
campus that Davis had used in setting it. 
</P>
<P>
There was no one near him during his morning swim. It was Barrowman against the 
clock, doing exactly what he had set out to do when he started his long-course 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman was the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion in the 200-yard 
breaststroke for Michigan. And he placed second in the 100-yard breaststroke. 
But he chose not to swim the 100-meter event in this meet because his coach, 
Joseph Nagy, wanted him to concentrate on the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Nagy, who is from Hungary, but is in the United States because his wife is on 
temporary duty with World Bank in Washington, D.C., also prepared Barrowman for 
the Olympic trials and the Olympic Games.

Fresno State, which won the Big West football title last season by going 
undefeated against conference teams, was chosen unanimously to repeat as 
champion in a poll of coaches Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State went 10-2 overall last season, losing only to Colorado and Oregon 
State. The Bulldogs defeated Western Michigan in the postseason California 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State, which went undefeated in the conference while winning titles in 
1986 and 1987 but fell to 4-3 in conference games and 4-8 overall last year, 
was predicted to finish second.

KNEE INJURY IN TRAINING CAMP MIGHT END DORSETT'S CAREER

<P>
Running back Tony Dorsett of the Denver Broncos is scheduled for further tests 
today to determine the extent of a knee injury that team officials fear could 
be career-ending. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett's left knee gave way while running a pass pattern during a Thursday 
morning workout in shorts. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old veteran was examined by trainer Steve Antonopulos and a team 
orthopedic surgeon. They indicated that Dorsett may have suffered ligament or 
cartilage damage, but they are reserving judgment until Dorsett undergoes a 
magnetic resonance imaging test in Denver today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit vague," Coach Dan Reeves said. "Until we do more tests, we 
won't know exactly the status of his knee. The knee is pretty stable and that's 
encouraging. But we do believe there is some damage in there. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we could be talking about his career, so we're being very careful." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett, entering his 13th National Football League season, returned to 
practice Wednesday after missing several days of workouts with a pulled 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's No. 2 all-time rusher with 12,739 yards, Dorsett gained 703 yards 
last season in his first year in Denver after being acquired in a trade from 
the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Only Walter Payton, with 16,726 yards, has more. Dorsett passed Franco Harris 
and Jim Brown though he was something of a disappointment last season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his age, Dorsett showed explosive bursts on occasion. But Reeves warned 
Dorsett that he needed to improve his pass-catching skills if he expected to 
have a job in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett spent most of the off-season in Dallas and made only occasional 
appearances at spring conditioning drills in Denver.

TORI ROMEO JOINS BIG SISTER ON PROFESSIONAL BOWLING STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REGINA ANDERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victoria Romeo started bowling as a youngster, a 9-year-old tagging along 
behind an older sister who was in a junior league in Mamaroneck, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years later, she is still following in the footsteps of that big 
sister, Robin, but now it's on the Ladies Professional Bowling Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a pretty good team," Tori said. "It is fun and very comfortable. She 
doesn't expect a ton out of me and I don't expect a ton out of her. Whatever 
happens, happens." 
</P>
<P>
Robin had established herself as one of the Tour's most successful bowlers long 
before Tori, as she is known to family and friends, rolled her first ball in a 
pro tournament in February. In 11 years on the Tour, Robin, 32, has won five 
national titles and more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tori, 27, had been content to watch her sister from the sidelines until this 
year when she decided to make a commitment to pro bowling, giving the tour its 
only team of sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"I let it (bowling) go for awhile, but this year I decided to do it," Tori 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Romeo family moved to Beverly Hills 10 years ago, Robin was already on 
the pro circuit. Tori, then 17, bypassed the local junior leagues and joined an 
adult league but soon found herself overwhelmed by the competition. So while 
Robin was on the road, Tori was bowling in monthly and regional tournaments 
trying to regain her confidence. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, three years after moving again -- this time to Van Nuys -- Tori's 
ego got a major boost when she won the West Coast Mixed Elimination tournament 
at Canoga Park Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with only six months' experience on the Tour, Tori believes she possesses 
the skills to compete with the pros. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tori, who has won $3,800 on the Tour thus far, is so confident that 
she has designs on the LPBT Rookie of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be cocky," she said. "It is all a part of the mental attitude. If 
you don't think you are good enough to win, then you don't need to be out 
there. I feel I belong out there." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tori says that she enjoys bowling professionally, she also says it has 
its drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the kind of sport where you like it or you don't," she said. "There is 
no in between. It is a very frustrating sport. It is something where you have 
to be mentally strong instead of physically. If you don't have it mentally it 
can be really hard." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the drawbacks, Tori contends she will continue bowling. "The money 
isn't that great, but I will stick it out as long as I can," she said.

THE SPORT OF HANG GLIDING CONTINUES TO WIN CONVERTS DESPITE CONCERNS OVER 
SAFETY AND A LACK OF OPEN SPACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myron Newman deftly hoisted the triangular-shaped hang glider to his shoulder 
and paused to catch his breath before trotting down the hill. A smooth breeze 
lifted the hang glider a few inches off the ground, giving Newman a brief, 
exhilarating thrill he had never expected. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Newman landed at the base of the hill, the most difficult part of 
his first hang-gliding experience was still to come. For the 68-year-old 
retired switchboard operator, telling his wife he has taken up hang gliding was 
to be the toughest part of the adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife doesn't know I'm doing this," Newman said. "She's very old-fashioned 
and I didn't think she would understand." 
</P>
<P>
Newman, of Sherman Oaks, never imagined himself hang gliding before he signed 
up for a class with Windsports International, a Van Nuys hang-gliding school 
and store. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw hang gliders I thought it was completely impractical for 
me," Newman said. "But when you're taking a class, it's not like you are just 
running to the end of a cliff and jumping off." 
</P>
<P>
Three times a week, a Windsports instructor teaches a group of six students the 
basics of hang gliding. They meet in the rolling foothills above Simi Valley, 
one of a dwindling number of hang-gliding areas in Southern California that 
have not been encroached on by housing projects or other developments. 
</P>
<P>
Most students, like Newman, had never seen a hang glider up close before taking 
their first lesson. Others, such as Jenise Collins, 31, of Los Angeles, are 
getting back into the sport after a long layoff. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Collins was strapped into a hang glider, 10 years ago, she 
crashed while landing, injuring three vertebrae and almost breaking her back. 
Collins couldn't shake the memory of her accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really afraid on my first flight in the class," Collins said. "I waited 
a long time to try this again, but it was still like getting back on a horse 
after falling off." 
</P>
<P>
After instructor Andy Beem shows his students how to assemble a hang glider, he 
runs downhill alongside the student, holding one of the glider's two steering 
lines. He shouts instructions throughout the brief flight as the student tries 
to get accustomed to dangling from a 30-foot wing. 
</P>
<P>
If a student advances past the introductory lesson, tandem flights with an 
instructor are conducted at either Kagel Mountain in Sylmar or in the desert 
surrounding Palmdale. High-altitude hang-glider flights began at Kagel Mountain 
in the early 1970s, soon after the sport took root at Dockweiler State Beach in 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is still considered one of the best places in the world for 
hang gliding, according to Gil Dodgen, editor of Hang Gliding magazine, a 
monthly publication of the U. S. Hang Gliding Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is still considered to be the mecca for hang gliding," 
Dodgen said. "In the 1970s, Southern California was a place where people were 
always doing new and bizarre things, so hang gliding was a natural sport for 
the area. People from all over the world come here to fly." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of California, hang gliding was still an obscure sport when Dodgen, 38, 
taught himself to hang glide in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big thrill in those early days to go out on a hill and find another 
hang glider," Dodgen said. 
</P>
<P>
Hang gliders are far from lonely today, however, especially in Southern 
California. While the sport's popularity has grown in the past 20 years, 
landing sites have become increasingly scarce. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, Windsports was forced to move from Moorpark to Simi Valley 
after a housing development crowded its training site. 
</P>
<P>
"Hang gliders still have their share of troubles in terms of places to go," 
said Joe Greblo, vice president of Windsports. "Houses are just going in 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Windsports now holds its introductory classes in an isolated area southwest of 
Simi Valley. But even that site is owned by a private developer and could soon 
be targeted for a housing project. 
</P>
<P>
"Availability of landing sites is one of the biggest problems in the sport 
today," Dodgen said. "The problem is that everybody is afraid of being sued if 
a hang glider gets hurt on their property. There are also environmental 
concerns and housing projects to contend with." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of injury is well-founded. Jerry Bruning, executive director of the 
USHGA, says 29 hang-glider pilots have died during the past two years and that 
he blames many of the deaths on pilot error. 
</P>
<P>
The USHGA and glider manufacturers organized in 1978 to improve safety 
conditions in hang gliding after a record 48 deaths were reported nationwide in 
1977. In addition to advances in the manufacturing of hang gliders, flight 
controls were imposed by groups, such as the Sylmar Hang Gliding Assn., to 
regulate some of the more dangerous launch sites throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of hang-gliding schools in the past 10 years also has helped to 
improve the safety record of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon the percentage of flights compared to the number of incidents, I 
would say hang gliding is a safe sport," Bruning said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodgen, who has not had a mishap in more than 1,500 flights and 16 years of 
flying, agrees -- to a point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a high-risk sport," he said. "How dangerous it is depends on how careful 
you are. You have to play the game by the rules and not take chances."

The fans at California Lutheran University Thursday were watching and comparing 
the arms of Troy Aikman, Steve Walsh and Billy Joe Tolliver. But the passer the 
football people were talking about was Steve Pelluer, the Cowboys' unsigned 
veteran quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman and Walsh are Dallas' highly paid rookies. Tolliver is the 
second-rounder from Texas Tech the Chargers hope will soon lead them into the 
playoffs. The three will be on display twice more today and again Saturday when 
the two teams conduct a live scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson said this week it was his understanding that the 
Chargers will pursue Pelluer in a trade if they are dissatisfied with 
Tolliver's progress through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, was downright 
testy when asked about Pelluer. "No," Ortmayer said of Pelluer, "we're not 
pursuing that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Charger staff will evaluate Tolliver after Saturday, Ortmayer 
said, "Not only Tolliver. But Mark Malone, David Archer and Mark Vlasic." The 
latter three are also Charger quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve Pelluer is a very good quarterback and ought to be playing for 
somebody," said Jerry Rhome, the Dallas quarterback coach who spent last year 
as the Chargers' offensive coordinator. "I think he and his agent made a 
mistake playing hardball on his contract." 
</P>
<P>
Rhome also said Pelluer doesn't fit into Dallas' plans anymore. The Cowboys' 
other two quarterbacks are Scott Secules and ex-Charger Babe Laufenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just the high man on the totem pole," said 29-year-old Laufenberg, 
referring to his age. Laufenberg was the Charger starting quarterback last year 
before the coaches replaced him with Malone. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Center Don Macek has a sprained ankle and didn't practice Thursday. Rookie 
center Courtney Hall strained an Achilles' tendon early in practice and 
couldn't finish practice. . . . The most impressive Charger unit was the 
defensive line, led by Lee Williams and Leslie O'Neal. It dominated the Cowboy 
offensive line in one-on-one drills. . . . Former Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer, 
accompanied by his daughter, watched practice from the sidelines.

LOCAL TEAM MISSING IN WATER POLO EVENT

<P>
It's like losing your voice on opening night or missing a surprise party in 
your honor. 
</P>
<P>
For six of the past eight years, San Diego Sunset, the county's top water polo 
club, has qualified for the U.S. Senior Men's National Water Polo 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the tournament will be held at UC San Diego's Canyon View Pool, 
beginning today and ending Sunday. It took years of finagling by Pacific 
Southwest Water Polo to bring the event here for the first time. But Sunset, 
the two-time defending senior indoor champion, won't be competing. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's zone qualifying, from which five of the 12 teams advanced, San 
Diego was knocked out by Santa Barbara and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely depressing," said Denny Harper, Sunset and UCSD coach. 
"Qualifying for this tournament is not an easy process at all. Summer after 
summer we've worked so hard to get it here, and now we're not playing in our 
hometown. It just didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Harper has had to completely change his goals for this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"At this very minute, I'm trying to adjust our goals," he said. "When I wanted 
to host it, the motivation was being able to play in a national tournament 
without having to travel." 
</P>
<P>
But with his team not competing, Harper is focusing on putting on an impressive 
event instead of his usual coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
"This have been a community effort," he said. "Everyone's worked . . . to get 
this thing done right." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first year the event, which ranks right behind the NCAA 
championship in importance, has been held outside the Los Angeles or San 
Francisco Bay areas. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Alberstein, PSWP district chairman and tournament director, said that 
outside of those areas, water polo awareness is low at best. 
</P>
<P>
"The real reason (it was moved here)," Alberstein said, "is there is a growing 
realization that if this is to grow across the county, they need to start 
putting the sport on display in other cities. Here, it's not as advanced as it 
is in L.A. or San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Next year's championship will be in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to obtain national sponsorship if (sponsors) don't feel they'll 
get national exposure," Alberstein said. "Putting water polo on display in 
other cities is one way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Water Polo Notes 
</P>
<P>
While the absence of San Diego Sunset is disappointing, the tournament is not 
totally without San Diego representation. Valhalla graduate James Fletcher 
plays for Newport B (UC Irvine's varsity) and University graduate Eric 
Bockstahler plays for Bruin Polo (UCLA's top team). . . . The top four seeded 
teams of the 12 in the tournament are Newport A, with three 1988 Olympians on 
the roster, Beach, affiliated with Long Beach State, Golden Bear of Berkeley 
and Bruin Polo.

BARRETT STAYS WITHIN RANGE IN COUNTY GOLF

Bill Barrett needed a great finish as he teed off on the par-five 18th hole at 
Torrey Pines South Thursday afternoon. A par would leave him in also-ran 
territory in the $40,000 Buie San Diego County Open, but anything better would 
keep him within range of the $4,500 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, from Spring Valley, finished with an eagle three and is one of eight 
golfers three shots behind Brad Bell and Mike Swartz, who are at six-under 138 
after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, from Sacramento, shot a 69 and Swartz, of Phoenix, shot 70 to tie for the 
lead entering today's final round. Seventy golfers made the cut of 149. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, like many toiling on the mini-tours, knows what a key shot or round 
can do for a golfer. 
</P>
<P>
There was that 63 he shot Saturday on the Golden State Tour stop at Rancho San 
Diego. It put him in a playoff that he eventually won on the 10th extra hole. 
</P>
<P>
Then there have been his last two attempts at the PGA Tour qualifying school. 
Both times, Barrett made it through the sectionals, only to finish one shot 
away from advancing to the final qualifying tournament in the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett is between qualifying schools. He hits the mini-tour trail to keep 
sharp and perhaps make a little money to help keep the drive alive. When he's 
not on the course, he's giving between 30 and 40 lessons a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I just do that to make me some money and keep playing," said Barrett, whose 
sister, Sharon, is on the LPGA Tour. "You have to try to make enough money to 
keep out of the gutter." 
</P>
<P>
After a couple more tournaments, Barrett will prepare for PGA qualifying school 
sectionals in October. This will be his ninth try. Once he made it to the final 
rounds but did not get his card. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these guys could do well on the tour if they could just get out 
there," Barrett said. "A lot of these guys on the (PGA) tour now made it when 
it wasn't as tough to get out there. Then they would have a qualifying school 
every six months. Now if you miss, it's like putting your life on hold for 
another year." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, 29, is not sure how many more years he has to qualify, but he's buoyed 
by a recent trend. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reading that the average age for guys getting their (PGA) card is 31," 
Barrett said. "The average age keeps going up because there are so many good 
players out there and they don't make it and keep going back."

DESPITE PAIN, FATIGUE, WAITE FEELS GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOLD

<P>
He had only two days rest after the nationals. He couldn't move his right arm 
over his shoulder, and he was just coming off two 200-meter heats. 
</P>
<P>
It sounded as if 24-year-old John Waite of Huntington Beach was making excuses. 
But this was after winning the gold medal in the kilometer event at the San 
Diego Velodrome during the opening day of the California State Games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a piercing pain shooting through his right shoulder on the start, Waite 
got out to the early lead an maintained it. He won in 1:14.61, nearly two 
seconds ahead of San Diego's Arnie Baker (1:16.03). Peter McCurdy, Baker's 
teammate at Cyclo West, placed third at 1:16.60. 
</P>
<P>
And about those excuses? Turns out Waite claimed the gold in the same event one 
year ago in 1:10.03 -- more than four seconds quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"My start was slower than I would have liked because of my shoulder," Waite 
said. "I tried to ignore it and tell myself to go all out for three laps and 
let it hurt later, but that first pedal stroke, it felt like my arm was coming 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Waite, who builds racing bikes, also qualified first in the 200-meter time 
trial and 200-meter quarterfinals, putting him in today's semis. 
</P>
<P>
At the nationals last weekend in Seattle, he placed among the top 12 before he 
was knocked out in the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun because the program itself is a little more relaxed," Waite said. 
"It's just that the way they promote the thing is conducive to going fast 
because you have a relaxed state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Mount Helix Cycling Club swept first through fifth in the junior 
omnium for 13-16-year olds. The order of finish: Marc Valencia, Richard Ludiam, 
Jeremy Chappell, Tony Cariola and Mark Caporale.

the Middle Atlantic region.

In boys' 16s, Brandon Halm, who was voted most-improved at Coronado High School 
each of the past two years, defeated Siri Appa, 7-5, 6-3. JOHN GEIS

NISEI WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At a fashion show to help launch Nisei Week, the annual celebration of the 
Japanese community in Los Angeles, Shirley Sakamoto attracted special 
attention. She is a third-generation Japanese-American who makes 
custom-designed clothes for private customers. And she was chosen as the only 
Asian designer to participate in this year's show. 
</P>
<P>
Other fashion entrees were selected from popular shops in the Montebello, Santa 
Ana, San Marino and Whittier areas. Among them were outfits from the Great 
American Short Story, Gap Kids and Units. Randi Tahara, a committee member for 
this year's show, explained that the theme of the show was the L.A. look. And 
the clothes that best seemed to fit were either ultra-casual or ultra-glitzy. 
In past years, she added, there have been more Japanese designers represented. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Sakamoto, age 34, is based in West Los Angeles and said she has never 
seen her clothes on a fashion runway until now. 
</P>
<P>
"Because so much of my work is custom-made, I never get to show the designs I 
create," she explained. "This show gave me a chance to show people what I like 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
Her style, rich but not really glitzy, is reminiscent of leading Japanese 
designers based in Paris, who prefer asymmetrical shapes and multilayered 
hemlines. She said she has never thought of her design shapes as having Asiatic 
influences, but her inspiration for colors derives from Indonesia, Turkey and 
Japan. The fall styles she presented at the show, sponsored by the Los 
Angeles-Nagoya Sister City Affiliation, were fitted gabardine suits and beaded 
silk organza or chiffon outfits for evening. They range in price from $100 for 
a blouse to $1,000 for an evening ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamoto is a graduate of L.A. Trade Technical Institute and worked for 
Tadashi, the Japanese transplant whose fashion company is based here now, 
before starting her own custom business more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tadashi has long been associated with Nisei Week, which officially begins on 
Saturday, as the designer of the pageant clothes for the Nisei Queen Court, a 
traditional part of the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to see more Asian designers who are just starting out," 
Sakamato said of the fashion show. "It is a great opportunity for us to 
approach an audience that is receptive to our creative expression and point of 
view."

DRAG OUT WELCOME MAT FOR 'EDEN COURT'

<P>
Welcome to Eden Court, a terribly ordinary trailer park on the border of 
Virginia and Maryland where the beers are plentiful and so are the mice, 
marijuana and marital disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
"Eden Court," by Murphy Guyer, debuted at the Humanas Festival at the Actors 
Theatre of Louisville six years ago. The touching comedy now comes to the Hahn 
Cosmopolitan by way of the Tamarind Theatre in Los Angeles, which is 
co-producing it with the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company, Fat Boy &amp; Sticks 
Productions and Kate Axelrod. 
</P>
<P>
Throw out the welcome mat. 
</P>
<P>
Guyer's first and perhaps greatest stroke of genius here is his name for the 
park and play. "Eden Court," a poignant reference to life before the fall from 
paradise, expresses longing for the perfect existence, in harmony with people, 
nature and God. 
</P>
<P>
If the rest is not genius, it does penetrate both the heart and head, with 
humor saving the pathos from descending into bathos. 
</P>
<P>
Paradise is a dream that Schroeder (Scott Allan Campbell) has all but given up 
as he approaches his 30th birthday. If most people are living lives of quiet 
desperation, as Thoreau said, then the eerily quiet Schroeder is among the most 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
He labors at a job he hates to make money. Then he goes to a bar after work 
where he spends the money to forget the job. He has lost whatever faith in God 
he might once have had; he figures that Moses came up with the Ten Commandments 
to keep the Jews from killing one another in the desert, and God -- if He does 
exist -- has probably created creatures so much superior that man is no better 
than a bacterium in a universe where his intelligence is far outstripped by 
that of the creatures in the UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
Don't have a clue as to what Schroeder is complaining about? Neither does his 
wife, Bonnie (Deborah Scott). But she has her suspicions. If he's tuning her 
out, and continues to refuse to have a baby with her, it must be because he's 
seeing another woman. So she cries and escapes into a world loaded with Elvis 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
It's fitting that Elvis Presley himself was an addict, hooked on pills, liquor 
and food. Everyone in Eden Court escapes into some kind of addiction to blot 
out the fear that their lives are pointless. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie divides her worship between Elvis and the church. A cross rests on her 
doorpost. Cluttering every other space in Barry Frost's funny/sad set design 
are likenesses of the King, from guitar lamps to towels, ash trays, throw 
pillows, photographs and, of course, the omnipresent music, which plays during 
and between the acts. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's drugs of choice are grass and beer. Bonnie's best friend, Barb 
(Stephanie Shroyer), a single mother who sports leg-hugging leopard tights, 
prefers hard liquor. Ditto Schroeder's friend, Carl (Tim deZarn), who divides 
his energy between drinking and chasing women. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble runs too deeply in stories like these for happy endings; the one false 
note here is that Guyer tries to tack one on. If there were an epilogue, it 
seems certain the solution that ends the play would prove painfully fleeting as 
the lies used to build the truce collapse under the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Guyer proves that even sad lives can, from moment to moment, 
be very funny. "It's high time women started taking care of themselves," Bonnie 
tells Schroeder as she hands him a jelly jar to open. "You got no standards," 
Schroeder says to Carl when Carl admits that he'll sleep with anybody. "Sure I 
do," Carl says. "They're low, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
The cast clings to the frequent one-liners -- as people so often do in life -- 
as lifesavers in turbulent, emotional waters. But, under Robert Spera's 
sensitive direction, they never forget that the water is cold, the current is 
strong and we are all so close to drowning. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's pain and confusion as Schroeder seem genuinely overwhelming. Scott 
is tall, vulnerable and never more piquant than when she dresses up in a baby 
doll nightie to surprise her husband and wears it with knee-length sweat socks. 
And deZarn is perfect as the bowlegged, pot-bellied Carl who can keep you 
laughing until you push him too far -- then you realize that, on a deeper 
level, he's smoldering too. 
</P>
<P>
Only Shroyer's Barb seems off the mark. She looks every inch the brassy broad 
in Miki Kim's gaudy costume design, but her quiet, modulated voice seems out of 
sync with the flashy presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Faul's light design gets lost in making the transition from Eden Court's 
long day's journey into night. And that reflects some of Guyer's own missteps 
in both deepening and resolving some of the intriguing questions and conflicts 
he poses here. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie's and Schroeder's families are alluded to, without being talked about. 
Bonnie's obsession with Elvis is not really explored (although she should be 
happy to learn that, on opening night, the Gaslamp reserved two seats for Elvis 
-- just in case). 
</P>

MCANALLY, MATLIN AND 'RAISIN' AT TOP OF THE EMMY OMISSIONS

<P>
Debating the prime-time Emmy nominations is half the fun of hearing about them. 
Maybe all the fun. 
</P>
<P>
So here is wisdom from the mount. 
</P>
<P>
It's encouraging to see so many TV achievements -- from ABC's landmark "War and 
Remembrance" to Robert Duvall's aging cowboy in the blockbuster CBS miniseries 
"Lonesome Dove" to the writing of ABC's "The Wonder Years" -- get the 
recognition they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
And it's interesting to contemplate the meaning of other inclusions: Do 
information-series nominations for the syndicated "A Current Affair" and the 
newly racy "Entertainment Tonight" confer legitimization on tabloid TV? 
</P>
<P>
Yet stunning omissions abound, beginning with the exclusion of Ray McAnally 
from the category honoring lead actors in a miniseries or special. 
</P>
<P>
If either Duvall or John Gielgud ("War and Remembrance") aren't victorious 
here, it will be the biggest upset since David and Goliath. Each was 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
However, McAnally, who died recently, arguably gave the season's best single 
performance as the charming, manipulative rogue of a father in the PBS 
novelization of John Le Carre's "A Perfect Spy." 
</P>
<P>
Nominees James Woods (ABC's "Bill W."), Ben Kingsley (HBO's "Murderers Among 
Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story") and Duvall's "Lonesome Dove" co-star Tommy Lee 
Jones also were very good, but not in a class with McAnally. An Emmy nomination 
would have been a nice way to celebrate him posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a case could also be made in this category for Danny Glover, who got 
a supporting actor nomination for his routine work in "Lonesome Dove," but 
nothing for his overpowering performance in the "American Playhouse" production 
of "Raisin in the Sun" on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable omissions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marlee Matlin as the troubled young mother of "A Bridge to Silence" on CBS; 
Esther Rolle, so memorable as the mother in "A Raisin in the Sun," and Oprah 
Winfrey, whose excellent work as a suffering matriarch was easily the best part 
of ABC's largely undistinguished "The Women of Brewster Place." The show got 
nominated; Winfrey didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Seymour ("War and Remembrance") is the class of this category for lead 
actresses in a miniseries or special. But a strong case could be made for 
Matlin, Rolle and Winfrey over of NBC's "Roe vs. Wade" nominees Amy Madigan and 
Holly Hunter and "Lonesome Dove" nominees Diane Lane and Anjelica Huston (who 
had a supporting, not a lead, role). 
</P>
<P>
 -- "A Raisin in the Sun," scintillating by any criteria, except those used by 
the Emmy nominators, whose choices for best drama or comedy special include the 
infinitely less deserving, but better publicized "My Name Is Bill W." and "Roe 
vs. Wade." 
</P>
<P>
 -- HBO's satirical "Tanner '88," which fittingly earned a director's 
nomination for Robert Altman, but was slighted in the dramatic series category 
despite providing TV's most biting and incisive political commentary of the 
presidential campaign. Brilliantly written by "Doonesbury" creator Garry 
Trudeau (who was also ignored in the nominations), it was bold and exiting TV. 
</P>
<P>
HBO's other fine entry in this category, "Vietnam War Story," also went 
unnominated, as did two of its highly worthy entries in the miniseries 
category: "A Dangerous Life" was an utterly captivating account of the the 
Marcoses' fall from power in the Philippines, and "Glory, Glory" was a musical 
satire of dishonest TV evangelists that was appealingly outrageous -- perhaps 
too outrageous for the Emmy crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," as charmingly enigmatic on cable's 
Lifetime network as it was on NBC, and "It's Garry Shandling's Show," the 
Showtime comedy (with repeats on Fox) that remains as daring and funny as 
anything on TV. Yes, no comedy deserves an Emmy over last year's winner from 
ABC, the wondrous "Wonder Years," which is also nominated this year. But none 
of the other nominees -- "Cheers" and "The Golden Girls" from NBC and 
"Designing Women" and newcomer "Murphy Brown" from CBS -- is as consistently 
funny and full of creative jolts as the Shandling show. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ken Olin and Mel Harris of ABC's "thirtysomething," overlooked in the 
category citing drama series leads. They're the very heart of this special 
show.

CBS IS A STRONG NO. 2 TO NBC IN EMMY NOMINATIONS

CBS may have ended last season in third place, but its surprise hit, the 
Western miniseries "Lonesome Dove," not-so-surprisingly netted the most 
nominations Thursday for the 41st annual nighttime Emmy Awards, topping by one 
the most nominated show of the last two seasons, "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
"Lonesome Dove," the critically acclaimed, eight-hour adaptation of Larry 
McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, garnered 18 nominations -- including 
one as best miniseries and others for stars Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Duvall, 
Diane Lane and Anjelica Huston. 
</P>
<P>
Its showing pushed CBS to a strong second place among the nomination leaders. 
Ratings king NBC, which has dominated the Emmy nominations for the last six 
years, collected 103 of the 364 nominations, with CBS getting 95 and ABC 85. 
PBS programs netted 32, and syndicated programs got 21 nominations. Fox 
Broadcasting shows got 12. Cable programs, which became eligible for nomination 
for the first time last year, received 16 nominations, only one more than last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne de Passe, co-executive producer of "Lonesome Dove" and president of 
Motown Productions, said Thursday that when she got the 6 a.m. call from the 
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences informing her of the 18 nominations, 
"I immediately burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the most satisfying moment I think I've ever had. . . ," she 
said. "I'm so thrilled -- not just for the actors and what they call the major 
categories, but for our costumer, all of the people who really gave it all of 
that look, the photography, the music. For me as a producer and as part of the 
producing team, it really means we selected great people." 
</P>
<P>
De Passe added that the multiple nominations will not affect Motown's decision 
on whether to produce a sequel to what was the highest rated miniseries of the 
last five years. That depends, she said, on whether author McMurtry endorses 
it. "It's the only way I would be happy (doing a sequel)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's best series winners -- ABC's "thirtysomething" in drama and ABC's 
"The Wonder Years" in comedy -- were nominated in those categories again and 
also picked up more total nominations than in their first year on the air. 
"thirtysomething" got 13, compared to its 1988 total of 10, while "The Wonder 
Years," which received only two nominations in 1988 -- in the series and 
writing categories -- garnered 14 this time out. 
</P>
<P>
CBS newcomer "Murphy Brown," starring Candice Bergen as a hard-driving TV 
newswoman, became the most-nominated new series of last season with 11 
nominations. But the series faces stiff competition in the best comedy 
category: Other nominees include previous Emmy-winners "The Wonder Years," 
NBC's "Golden Girls" and NBC's "Cheers," along with CBS' "Designing Women." 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled, we're just thrilled," said Diane English, co-executive 
producer of "Murphy Brown" with husband Joel Shukovsky. "A part of me would 
like to be the kind of person who says, 'It means nothing; I don't care,' but 
let's be honest: This is pretty great -- especially since we're such a new 
show." 
</P>
<P>
English acknowledged that the thrill of being nominated is tempered by the 
waiting period between now and the Emmy Awards ceremony, which will be held 
Sept. 17 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the part when it's not so much fun, where people try to involve you in 
that competition, and it really shouldn't be that," she said. "It would be 
great if it didn't come down to one winner, because the stuff that gets 
nominated is all so good. It would be great if it just ended here -- that these 
are the five best shows in each category." 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy Brown" has been only a marginal ratings success for CBS -- but ratings 
don't necessarily translate into Emmy nominations. The three top-rated series 
of last season received only six nominations among them -- four for ABC's 
"Roseanne" and one each for NBC's Thursday-night tandem of "The Cosby Show" and 
"A Diffent World" -- and none was nominated as best comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
The star of "Roseanne," former stand-up comedian Roseanne Barr, also failed to 
win nomination as best actress in a comedy series, although John Goodman, who 
plays her husband, was nominated as best actor. Also notably absent among the 
comedy nominees was John Larroquette of "Night Court," who has won the Emmy as 
best supporting actor for four years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But while Barr was an entrant in the competition, Larroquette was not: The 
actor took advantage of a new Emmy rule that requires actors to enter 
themselves in the competition, as do producers, writers and entrants in all 
other categories. In previous years, the producers of the shows were allowed to 
enter their cast members in the acting categories. 
</P>
<P>
Larroquette said Thursday that he chose not to enter. "I think my thought 
process was that the generosity of the Academy toward me has been magnanimous, 
and I just felt that I didn't want to overstay my welcome," he said. "I don't 
think there was any real devious thought about it, such as, 'I've never lost 
and I don't want to lose now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Along with the "Murphy Brown" nomination as best comedy, CBS scored another 
coup in the best drama category with its second-season series "Wiseguy," the 
story of undercover agent Vinnie Terranova (Ken Wahl). Other best drama 
nominees were ABC's "China Beach," CBS' "Beauty and the Beast," NBC's "L.A. 
Law" and ABC's "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
Wahl also found a place among the nominated lead actors in a drama series, 
along with Ron Perlman of "Beauty and the Beast," Edward Woodward of "The 
Equalizer," Carroll O'Connor of "In The Heat of the Night" and Michael Tucker 
of "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
Lead actresses nominated in the drama category were Linda Hamilton of "Beauty 
and the Beast," Dana Delany of "China Beach," Susan Dey and Jill Eikenberry of 
"L.A. Law," and Angela Lansbury of "Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
Several special programs and movies received multiple nominations. "My Name Is 
Bill W.," ABC's dramatization of the life of the man who started Alcoholics 
Anonymous, got 7, including an acting nomination for James Woods. NBC's 
controversial "Roe vs. Wade," the story of the landmark abortion case, got 6 
nominations, among them nods for outstanding lead actress in a miniseries or 
special for Holly Hunter and Amy Madigan. 
</P>
<P>
The PBS "Great Performances" installment "Dance In America: Gregory Hines Tap 
Dance in America" won five nominations; HBO's "Murderers Among Us: The Simon 
Wiesenthal Story" got three. 
</P>
<P>
On the late-night front, newcomer Arsenio Hall may not be beating competitors 
Johnny Carson and David Letterman in the ratings yet, but he got more Emmy 
nominations: "The Arsenio Hall Show" got three, and Carson and Letterman got 
only two.

TRADITION TRIUMPHS AT GAETANO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can still go into almost any trattoria in Italy and expect to be served a 
meal that's in keeping with that country's traditionally high culinary 
standards. This isn't true of Italian restaurants outside of Italy. There seems 
to be an almost uniform willingness to adapt the cooking to local expectations, 
traditional standards be damned. 
</P>
<P>
So, when at Gaetano's Bistro in Woodland Hills, I ordered for tasting purposes 
an obviously inappropriate combination of pasta -- with duck, with sausage, 
with seafood -- I was amazed that the chef (who, of course, didn't know that I 
wasn't a typical diner) cared enough to try to protect his work -- and my 
palate -- by suggesting that the seafood pasta be replaced by another. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to respecting his craft and tradition, he turned out to be 
uncommonly talented. Fusilli with smoked duck breast and sun-dried tomatoes was 
superb. The duck was moist and flavorsome, the ensemble wisely balanced. 
Rigatoni benefited from savory sausage and wild mushrooms while the gnocchi 
(with pesto and mascarpone), the most challenging of pastas, had the 
unmistakeable -- and rare -- texture of the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Shitake mushrooms are hardly part of the Italian tradition, but vinegared and 
topped with melted Scamorza cheese, you could have fooled me. I was sure that 
the smokiness of this hearty cheese would overpower the mushrooms. But the 
marinade made them not only stand up to it but complement it as well. 
</P>
<P>
Cold shrimp are rarely served freshly cooked. Not so here. Shrimp with the 
crispest, thinnest green beans and a drizzle of olive oil had been cooked so 
little and so recently that they were still tender and full-flavored. Less 
successful was the carpaccio, which, though of excellent quality, was 
overpowered by a mustard sauce, even though the meat was too thickly sliced. 
Calamaretti fritti were uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
There are no fixed fish dishes at Gaetano's: All the menu says is "Today's 
Fresh Fish." The only indication of the seriousness with which the restaurant 
takes this tricky aspect of any menu are the fish dishes themselves -- 
perfectly grilled whole bronzino (striped bass), filleted at table side, for 
instance. But, wait a minute, is the waiter tainting it with some dark sauce 
(even if he's decent enough to spoon it next to the fillets)? Happens all the 
time. What doesn't happen all the time is that the sauce turns out to be 
exquisite and appropriate. It didn't have a name, but I'd call it forestiere, 
because it seemed to be made of melted wild mushrooms smelling of a dark moist 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult for other entrees to shine in comparison. Slices of lamb loin 
with a cream of roasted garlic sauce were enjoyable, as was chicken with 
Mediterranean vegetables. Halibut with a light cream sauce and fennel was 
slightly overcooked. The side vegetables and potatoes, notably spinach and 
herbed roasted new potatoes, were uniformly excellent. 
</P>
<P>
There is a more than adequate list of Italian, French and California wines. The 
Cortese di Gavi was crisp and dry with a flowery Sauvignon Blanc finish. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are professional. They are not, however, made with a fine Italian 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Gaetano's is in a new office building complex whose name, Trillium, and marble 
surfacing speak of its pretensions. There is, however, nothing pretentious 
about the restaurant. Maybe it's the affable reception you receive, the decor, 
or more likely, a combination of both that make it an unexpectedly comfortable 
place. The comfort is unexpected because the polished metal and pastel fabric 
interior by rights should be insipid but isn't. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints are minimal. On one occasion there was too long a wait between 
courses. Air-conditioning draughts in the booths near the windows can be 
disturbing. But these are small things. The big thing is that this is a 
restaurant so good you will want to reserve a table. And when you do, you will 
probably get it on time. I am happy to report that it doesn't overbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaetano's Bistro, 6336 Canoga Ave., Woodland Hills, (818) 596-5900. Open for 
lunch, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Monday-Friday; for dinner 5:30-10:30 p.m. 
Monday-Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking. American Express, MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $35-$50.

CALARTS SJJUMMER STUDENTS LEARN PRICE OF DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tamar Shavit sacrificed a trip to the Soviet Union. Heather Ross sacrificed a 
trip to the television set. 
</P>
<P>
And Aaron Bonnell gave up a chance to fatten his thin teen-age wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby summer of vacation and vegetating. Hello summer of discipline and 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
These three, along with about 350 other talented teen-agers from throughout the 
state, are wrapping up their studies at the third annual California State 
Summer School for the Arts in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
The intense, four-week session, funded by state and private donations, forces 
students to match their dreams with dedication. For many, it's their first 
glimpse of Life After High School. Do they have enough desire to become a 
professional artist? Do they have enough talent? 
</P>
<P>
They arrive with some talent, having passed an audition at one of 19 locations 
throughout the state. The California Legislature established the $1.2-million 
program in 1985, and Gov. George Deukmejian allocated $580,000 as the state's 
present share. 
</P>
<P>
At CalArts, students attend all-day classes in the discipline of their choice 
-- music, dance, film, video, creative writing and visual arts -- and, if they 
want, go to sessions outside their main interest. 
</P>
<P>
Classes are held six days a week, and most students use the day off to polish 
their skills. About 150 instructors take part in the program, which is designed 
to develop the potential of the state's young artists. Robert Jaffe, the deputy 
director, said the program tries to maintain a ratio of nine students per 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, students attend films, concerts and lectures. Among the 
summer's well-known guest speakers: Charles Haid, formerly of "Hill Street 
Blues"; James Edward Olmos of "Stand and Deliver," and John Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
The $1,000 fee includes room, board and tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnell assumed that he would spend the summer in his native Yuba City in 
Northern California, flipping hamburgers at McDonalds. Summer school at CalArts 
seemed as likely as starring with Tom Cruise in his next feature. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be like 'Fame' and way over my head," said Bonnell, 16, who 
dreams of becoming an actor. "I didn't think I was good enough to make it. Now 
I have found out that I am." 
</P>
<P>
Like many others, though, he was initially terrified. It's one thing to prosper 
in the surroundings of such small towns as Yuba City; it's quite another to 
impress peers from throughout the state. The pressure got to Bonnell in his 
first few days. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never so nervous in my life," Bonnell said. "I had an audition to do, 
and that night, I threw up. Being here was something I had looked forward to 
for so long, and now that I was here, I got scared. It took me a while to 
realize that I belong with them, that they weren't some separate group I looked 
at from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the program can be a sobering experience, an early, helpful 
hint that perhaps an artistic career is not one's destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people see how much work being an artist takes and see they're not as 
excited about it as they thought they were," said Bill Cleveland, the program's 
director. "And that's an equally valuable lesson to learn. Better that they 
know this now." 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Mulhall, 15, of Nevada City in Northern California isn't ready to 
abandon her acting ambition, but she'll leave CalArts with a greater awareness 
of its demands. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people here better than me, and that is scary," Mulhall 
said. "I have to get a lot better. Maybe I won't have the desire. I really 
wouldn't mind becoming a veterinarian." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Cleveland said it is important that the program's instructors 
instill a dose of realism into the students without completely shattering their 
hopes and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times have people been wrong in making that judgment?" Cleveland 
said. "All we expect is them to live up to a standard of hard work. If they're 
not, that's when we say something." 
</P>
<P>
As Peter Kors, 42, an acting instructor, sees it, his role is to give students 
useful, practical information about the profession. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them, if they are handed a script, to be able to know what to do," Kors 
said. "Most of them have a certain amount of overall discipline and commitment. 
What they need to learn is what the exact nature of acting is, and how they can 
use their bodies to respond naturally and spontaneously to situations around 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Kors teaches them that mastering the relationship between their bodies and the 
space around them will make them more natural actors. He employs many 
techniques, including a long exercise session at the beginning of class to get 
the teen-agers in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get stoked," he tells the students. "If you're serious about acting, you 
must take care of your bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Shavit is serious about acting. When she arrived at CalArts, she feared that 
her parents' dream -- her nightmare -- of becoming a lawyer seemed inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here thinking acting wasn't going to be my life," said Shavit, 15, of 
Sherman Oaks. "And now I know nothing else can be my life. People here told me 
I have talent, and I have been studying for nine years and nobody ever told me 
I had talent. I only kept doing it because I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
She is prepared for the long struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard about people who have roaches in their apartment, but go to the 
theater every night, and that excites me," Shavit said. "I live in a yuppie 
Sherman Oaks home, and I can see giving up my VCR, my Dustbuster, my garage 
door opener. I have changed here." 
</P>
<P>
Dancers at the summer school are equally motivated. Ross, 17, of Redlands, who 
wants to be a dancer, is attending the school for the second time. After 
returning home last year, she fully appreciates the difference between CalArts 
and Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
"You're lucky back home if you get two classes a day," Ross said. "Here, you 
have at least six hours a day and usually more because you practice so much. 
You really live the life you dream about." 
</P>
<P>
Ross had no trouble sacrificing part of her summer for another chance at 
CalArts. "I would have just sat in front of the tube and grabbed something from 
the refrigerator."

And neither did others, like Shavit, who could have seen other parts of the 
world and had a great experience. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is what I want to do with the rest of my life," Shavit said. "This is 
where I had to be."

As Ross puts it: "One day, someone in this group will be famous. You look 
around and you just wonder who it is."

OBSESSION FOR DESERT COMES ALIVE ON CANVAS; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER LANDSCAPE PAINTER FOCUSES ON INTERPLAY OF LAND, SKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Doug Oliver relaxes in a well-furnished living room in a big house in a 
subdivision that could be anywhere -- except for the paintings on the walls 
reflecting his obsession for the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver's paintings of high desert vistas have spread the name of the Antelope 
Valley as far as New York, where he says people can't get enough of 
Southwestern landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Oliver nor his Lancaster house fit the image evoked by the term 
"desert artist," which suggests someone more rustic, an old prospector with a 
burro, a paintbrush and a drawl. Someone like Walt Lee, Oliver's former teacher 
and his predecessor as the artistic emissary of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The works of Lee and Oliver are being featured through September at the 
Lancaster Museum and Art Gallery. The joint exhibit, titled "A Legacy and a 
Vision," celebrates the local artistic tradition embodied by Lee, who died in 
1980 after a career as a newspaper cartoonist and Lancaster-based artist whose 
paintings of ghost towns, desert life and other Western scenes drew 
international acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit also showcases the success that Oliver has experienced since 1981, 
when he abandoned his job as a high school art teacher to paint full time. He 
has sold hundreds of paintings across the nation at prices of up to $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a year and a half of slow times," said Oliver, whose work is found 
in galleries in New York state; Scottsdale and Sedona, Ariz.; Carmel, Calif., 
and Denver, as well as in the Los Angeles area. "But the growing popularity of 
the Southwestern style helped. I'm thrilled to be able to do what I do and make 
a living at it." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, 46, is exclusively a landscape painter. He works with acrylics -- 
paints that can be mixed with water and dry faster than oil-based paints and 
are better for outdoor use. He roams California, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona 
searching for subjects for paintings that are usually devoid of human presence, 
concentrating instead on spectacular interplays of land and sky. 
</P>
<P>
He also roams the Antelope Valley, where he has lived since his parents moved 
from Ohio when he was a boy in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Lee retired from his job as an editorial cartoonist for 
the Los Angeles Times and moved to Lancaster to paint. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was a judge in an art contest that Oliver entered when he was 12. Oliver 
didn't win, but Lee liked his work well enough that he offered to give the boy 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver became a sidekick on Lee's picturesque excursions into the desert, which 
also involved Lee's burro and a black felt hat given to Lee by the actor Harry 
Carey Sr. The hat is part of the museum exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1955 Times article, Lee comes off as a crusty character reclined under a 
Joshua tree with his easel, scoffing at "that Toulouse Lay-trec fella" and 
declaring: "Mister, there's more art right here on this desert than in all the 
museums in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the image, Oliver said: "The cliche is that he was ornery, but he was 
actually a soft guy. He was very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Lee was more of an inspiration than an actual mentor for Oliver; they only 
studied together about a year. Oliver's stately landscapes differ considerably 
from Lee's more impressionistic and diverse work. 
</P>
<P>
"His influence was minor as far as technique and style," Oliver said. "I credit 
him with getting me started." 
</P>
<P>
Another formative influence was -- and continues to be -- music. Oliver studied 
piano as a youth and was a church organist. He says his development as a 
painter owed a great deal to the daily discipline that he gained studying 
music, a trait Oliver says he has found lacking in many peers and students. 
</P>
<P>
Art critics have praised the musical quality that permeates Oliver's paintings 
such as "First Mesa Symphony," a majestic vision of clouds and Mojave Desert 
buttes and vegetation, with one critic calling Oliver a concertmaster of color 
and natural themes. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver listens to classical music while he paints, particularly Tchaikovsky and 
other Russian composers. 
</P>
<P>
"I can hear the color in a symphonic tone poem," he said. "Like music, painting 
has a firm theme; it ends where it starts. It has texture, it has temperature, 
light and dark, highs and lows." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver studied at Chouinard Art Institute, which later became part of CalArts 
in Valencia, and at the University of Redlands, where he earned a master's 
degree in art education, then began a 15-year career as a teacher at Antelope 
Valley public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
He grew to hate it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a sponge," he said. "It drained me." 
</P>
<P>
About eight years ago, Oliver's local reputation had grown to the point that 
almost half his income came from painting. He and his wife, Barbara, who owns a 
Lancaster art supply store and gallery, decided that it was time for him to 
take a risk. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the risk has paid off, Oliver travels frequently in two- or three-week 
stints, then retreats to his studio to paint natural scenes from memory. He is 
methodical and prolific, producing as many as 20 paintings a month. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver may have disliked teaching, but he says he owes a great debt to his 
community and is trying to pay it back. About 15% of the proceeds of works sold 
at the Lancaster show will go to the museum. Eight of the 23 on display have 
been sold since the exhibit opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is also receiving $4 for every $25 spent on a popular 
limited-edition poster titled "Antelope Valley" -- a composite landscape 
featuring eastern buttes and western poppy fields. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver says his hometown is "quiet, a great place to work," but commented that 
headlong growth and urbanization over the years have wrought great changes in 
Lee's "museum" of natural treasures. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the rush of development that some residents say will turn the 
Antelope Valley into the San Fernando Valley one day, Oliver responded quietly, 
saying he is not interested in making a political statement. 
</P>
<P>
But his words had a flash of emotion that showed what Oliver and Lee have in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to see the desert disappear," he said. "I just want people to 
remember how it was. I'd like people to appreciate that what they may consider 
barren and Godforsaken, I consider fragile and beautiful. It's disappearing. I 
wouldn't be surprised if one day they have Joshua trees in cages, behind glass 
in museums." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Legacy and a Vision" is at the Lancaster Museum and Art Gallery, 44801 N. 
Sierra Highway, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays and 1 to 4 p.m. 
weekends through Sept. 17. The museum is closed Mondays and holidays. Admission 
is free.

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: PAIR OF TIJUANA SHOWS TOO NARROW IN VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego hardly deserves the epithet of a sleepy border town, but in terms of 
recognizing artists living just on the other side of the line, this city has 
slumbered long and deep. 
</P>
<P>
Like the country at large, however, the city awoke with a start last year and 
began to make up for lost time. Regular exhibitions of Mexican art have shown 
at the Iturralde Gallery (formerly La Casa del Arte), and the La Jolla Museum 
of Contemporary Art organized a show of Tijuana artists for its downtown space, 
Sushi gallery played host to two shows of Tijuana artists, and an exhibition of 
contemporary Mexican art has been seen at Mesa and Palomar colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Each had its share of compelling work, and each introduced a local audience to 
currents of activity that had not passed through San Diego with such vigor 
before. None, however, claimed to be a comprehensive survey of its territory, 
and viewers were left to wonder what else may have been overlooked while the 
city's attention to the south lay dormant. 
</P>
<P>
Two current shows at the Centro Cultural Tijuana (Paseo de los Heroes, Tijuana) 
address that curiosity by presenting the work of more than 40 artists living in 
Tijuana -- all of the "serious" artists there, according to a representative of 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
One show, "Elogio a Tijuana," delivers a eulogy, or declaration of praise, for 
the city through a survey of its artists. The other, "Grupo Centenario," 
presents work made specifically in honor of the city's centennial this year by 
10 artists working loosely as a collective. 
</P>
<P>
Both shows contain work that is broad in range but overall narrow in vision. 
Except for a handful of engaging paintings, the shows threaten to lull even the 
most eager visitor back into the sleepy ignorance that characterized our 
southward gaze for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana's own dynamic growth, its status as a thoroughfare for immigrants 
heading north, its extremes of wealth and poverty and numerous facets of its 
history would seem to be fertile subjects for the artists in the "Grupo 
Centenario" show. Most, however, adopt a static, shallow approach to their 
theme, representing the city through images of its architectural landmarks 
nestled within decorative compositions. 
</P>
<P>
The bland tone of these works is broken only briefly, by the thoughtful work of 
Manolo Luis Escutia and a collage by Alejandro Chanona. An Escutia triptych 
pays homage to the anonymous women who work in maquiladoras; in another work, 
he visualizes the city's history as a montage of human and material products, 
both bearing strong imprints of American influence. 
</P>
<P>
In "Las Cien Tes" ("One Hundred Ts"), Escutia examines the letter T, finding 
its vertical and horizontal lines to be symbols of hope and frustration and, 
together, an appropriate emblem for the city of Tijuana. He repeats the letter 
on 100 sheets of paper, forming each with a different pattern or image that 
represents an aspect of the city. This approach, with its political, 
agricultural and cultural references, encourages a multifaceted reading of the 
city, not one limited to its physical appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Chanona's collage, "T. J. Cien Anos" ("T.J. 100 Years"), also provokes thought 
about the city's character and the challenges it faces. All but one corner of 
the collage is smothered by a dense patchwork of clothing tags, references to 
Tijuana's status as a haven for American bargain hunters. In the one quiet 
corner, only two labels appear. One bears the words One Way and an arrow 
pointing up to the jumble of tags, and the other advertises a "Total Selloff," 
to which the artist has added the emblem of the Mexican flag and the words T.J. 
100 Anos. 
</P>
<P>
Through this small intervention, Chanona expresses a sharp note of concern 
about the Americanization and exploitation of Tijuana. In the accompanying wall 
label, he shares his cynical hope that in 100 years, when the city celebrates 
its bicentennial, people will still be speaking Spanish and eating tacos. 
</P>
<P>
The adjacent exhibition, "Elogio a Tijuana," is crowded with weak, facile 
imagery, forced enigmas and failed fantasies. Only a few of the artists 
included manage to convey a strong personal vision or style. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Almada's "El Jaguar," for instance, a simple yet bold rendering of a 
jaguar being struck down by an anonymous, all-powerful hand, evokes a narrative 
of mythic proportion. In an untitled photograph by Ana Maria Herrera, a 
sculpture of a male torso stands amid the deep shadows of an abandoned 
building. The surrogate human presence exudes a mystery and surreal magnetism 
akin to the subjects of Mexico's photographic patriarch, Manuel Alvarez Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
The soul of the show is not to be found in these scattered impressions, 
however, but in the grouping of 2 dozen paintings by Benjamin Serrano Banuet, 
who died last year. The exhibition begins with his relatively staid, 
environmental portraits of a prominent Tijuana family, then jumps abruptly to a 
whimsical self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the artist playfully pinches the conventions of dignified portraiture 
that rule the preceding paintings by appearing shirtless, wearing a folded 
paper hat and false nose, and playing a violin to an oversized green apple. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano was a prolific artist whose paintings, prints and sculptural 
assemblages embody the wisdom of dreams and the whimsical spirit of games. 
Though this selection of his works is spotty and includes none of his 
brilliantly funny sculptures, it does hint at the richness of his personal 
vocabulary. Impossible flying contraptions sputter about among turtles with 
wings, fish with human heads, people with paper-doll tabs and women ripe with 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the artists in "Elogio a Tijuana" emulate Serrano's spree through 
the realms of fantasy and dreams, but none matches his passion and wit. 
</P>
<P>
"Elogio a Tijuana" was organized by the Centro's new director, Pedro Ochoa 
Palacio, to mark the first visit by the director of the Consejo Nacional para 
la Cultura y las Artes. Both shows continue at the center through Aug. 14.

EAST MEETS WEST -- AS USUAL; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE PROTESTS OUTSIDE, ATTITUDE AT CHINA EXPO IS BUSINESS IS BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

While a handful of protesters outside called for an economic boycott against 
China, business thrived inside the Shrine Exposition Hall on Thursday, where 
American buyers perused Chinese wares on display at China Expo '89. 
</P>
<P>
As the largest Chinese trade exhibit on the West Coast since the Beijing 
military crackdown June 3-4, the Expo attracted more than 600 American buyers 
its first day. They browsed through fabrics, toasters, toys, televisions and 
other wares being offered by 61 Chinese companies from Shanghai and the 
province of Fujian. 
</P>
<P>
"We just took a $270,000 order for theater lights," said Liu Xiongguan, deputy 
manager of export for the Shangahi Instrumentation and Electronics Import and 
Export Corp. 
</P>
<P>
He said the recent political unrest in China has had no impact on business for 
his company, especially when it comes to regular customers. The company that 
purchased the lights, Commerce Cinema Corp. of Rosemead, had been doing 
business with his company for three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Buchsbaum, director of Henry Unger International Corp., a Los Angeles 
import consulting firm that buys toys and souvenirs for clients such as 
Disneyland and Universal Studios, said events in China also have not deterred 
his company from trading with China. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see and hear from the people in China is that they are still anxious 
for economic reform, not political reform," Buchsbaum said. "As far as a 
contract, delivery dates and prices, there is no change as a result of Tian An 
Men Square (events)." He took advantage of Thursday's trade show to meet with 
business acquaintances from the Shanghai Shen Hua Import and Export Co. 
</P>
<P>
The steady stream of visitors at the trade show was in sharp contrast to the 
subdued mood at an Ohio trade exhibit in June, just days after a bloody clash 
between protesters and soldiers in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Security at the Los Angeles trade show was tight, in light of the presence of 
20 to 30 protesters from pro-democracy groups such as Chinese Alliance for 
Democracy, the Western American Assn. of Chinese Political Refugees, and the 
Federation of Independent Chinese Student Unions. 
</P>
<P>
Standing near blue-and-white banners in Chinese and English that said, "We'll 
never forget Beijing massacre," and "Don't do business with murderers," the 
protesters tried to talk to Chinese trade delegates and hand them newspaper 
reports of the Chinese crisis. 
</P>
<P>
One 62-year-old man who refused to give his name but described himself as a 
consultant to some of the Chinese trade companies rebuffed the protesters: "I 
know the situation. I've seen it on television. We don't have to force our 
views on others." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeding with China Expo '89 had been a dilemma for the event's organizer, 
San Marino resident Wai-Jen Jeffries. During the turmoil in China, Jeffries and 
her husband, Ray, had attended a rally outside the Chinese Consulate in Los 
Angeles to show their sympathy with pro-democracy protesters in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hard Decision' 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Jeffrieses decided to continue the trade show as scheduled 
because in the long run, a boycott would only hurt the United States and China, 
Ray Jeffries said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard decision, but after we thought about it, we felt we had to deal 
with the world as it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the trade show's opening ceremonies Thursday, Vice Consul General An 
Wenbin congratulated Wai-Jen Jeffries for her 18-month effort to organize the 
trade show. 
</P>
<P>
An Wenbin also was eager to assure American firms that China is still a good 
place to do business. "This exhibit is a vivid expression that the policy of 
open door in China will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus McNamara, a representative of Costa Mesa-based IMXX International 
Trading Co., which sells outdoor clothing, examined some down jackets. Taking a 
practical approach, he said, "I believe in China as a source of products. It is 
too big go untapped. Business is business."

Money Supply Down: All three measures of the nation's money supply fell in the 
week ended July 24, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The measure known as M2 
fell $1.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,121.2 billion from $3,122.7 
billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell $4.6 billion to 
$4,004.3 billion from $4,008.9 billion. The narrowest measure of the money 
supply, M1, fell $1.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $776.2 billion from 
$777.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts 
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits 
and money market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as 
certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000.

IRS Says Exxon, Texaco Owe Back Taxes: The Internal Revenue Service has billed 
Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc. for more than $2 billion in back taxes and 
interest, but the huge oil companies said they will challenge the claims in 
court. Texaco said the IRS claims the oil company owes $1.79 billion in taxes 
from 1979 to 1981, when it sold oil to its affiliates at below-market value. 
Exxon Corp. said the IRS has billed it $269 million for 1979 in connection with 
oil that the government of Saudi Arabia sold to Exxon and Texaco in a bid to 
stabilize the world crude market. Interest on the Exxon payments could double 
the amount of money the IRS seeks. Exxon said it had filed a petition in the 
U.S. Tax Court in Washington over the IRS bill. Texaco, based in White Plains, 
N.Y., said it also would fight the IRS claim.

Car, Truck Sales Down: Sales of U.S. built cars fell 6.0% in late July. The 
decline came despite generous consumer and dealer incentive plans by General 
Motors Corp. and 0% financing by Chrysler. "The one thing that's a little hard 
to fathom is the poor GM results given the mad money they're throwing out 
there," said analyst Joseph Phillippi at Shearson Lehman Hutton. GM added a 
dealer incentive plan onto its rebate program. Estimated to cost more than $1 
billion, it pays dealers up to $1,000 extra per car above sales targets. Ford's 
rebate plan expired July 31; last minute sales may have accounted for its 
better results.

ADVERTISERS FIND A HOT NEW MEDIUM -- THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look now, but some Southern California beaches are now being brought to 
you by the makers of Vans athletic shoes and PCH Sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention Nissan cars, radio station KTWV-FM 94.7 (the Wave) and very 
shortly, Body Glove swimwear. 
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Vans and PCH began to place advertising on the sides of more than 
150 new, beachside phone kiosks that stretch all the way from Redondo to Zuma 
Beach. Already, KTWV advertises on 6,000 trash cans it supplies to beaches, and 
Nissan has given the county 41 vehicles that have emblems saying they are the 
"official" cars of the Los Angeles county beaches. Later this summer, those 
familiar signs that tell beach goers the size of the surf will also have small 
ads for Body Glove. 
</P>
<P>
Another recent addition are the phone kiosk ads -- GTE has placed more than 100 
new phone booths at Los Angeles beaches. And officials from the Los Angeles 
County Department of Beaches and Harbors have agreed to split advertising 
income with the phone company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beaches Ran a $7-Million Deficit 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everyone likes advertising-by-the-sea. It has been a thorny 
issue that the Board of Supervisors has wrestled with several times over the 
past decade. Although various forms of advertising are allowed on Los Angeles 
beaches, until now the county hasn't tried very hard to capitalize on that. 
After all, most people come to beach to see surf, not ads. 
</P>
<P>
But the county beaches ran a $7-million deficit last year, and they are looking 
for new revenue sources through marketing. Advertisers say they are only taking 
advantage of the unusual opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't us, it would be someone else," said Craig Fronk, director of 
marketing at PCH Sportswear, a Los Alamitos manufacturer of beachwear. "At 
least our ads are in good taste." 
</P>
<P>
The PCH Sportswear ads show a volleyball player spiking a ball over a net. 
Until now, the posters had mostly been placed on shopping mall kiosks. The ads 
are already garnering so much attention that Fronk said he would eventually 
like to place them on Orange County and San Diego beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vans phone booth ads show the company logo on a flashy neon 
background. The posters will soon be replaced with new ads that feature Vans 
shoes and the slogan "From mild to wild." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Some Complaints 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't too many places at the beach to advertise," said Steve Van Doren, 
director of marketing and promotions at Orange-based Van Doren Rubber Co., 
which makes Vans shoes. His company is paying $11,000 per month for 90 phone 
booth ads at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Beach goers, skateboarders and surfers are really a big market for our canvas 
shoes," said Van Doren. "So where better to reach them than at the beach?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, some people say just about anywhere else would be better. "Sure, we've 
received some complaints," said Ted Reed, director of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Beaches and Harbors. "But there's a trade-off, because the cost 
of operating the beaches comes out of public tax dollars. And this revenue 
helps us hire additional lifeguards and keep the beaches clean." 
</P>
<P>
Still, billboards are not permitted on Los Angeles beaches, and the county will 
not permit ads for cigarettes or alcohol. But the department is considering one 
unusual avenue for future advertising income. It is negotiating with a clothing 
company that wants to put a simulation of the department's logo on its 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as advertising goes," said Reed, "that should just about tap us out."

Paramount Sues Video Firms: Paramount Pictures said it has filed a lawsuit 
against Video Broadcasting Systems and several Midwestern video companies that 
have allegedly placed local advertising messages on home videotapes of 
Paramount movies after the videocassettes were acquired by local video 
retailers for sale or rental. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in 
Wichita, Kan.

LEADING INDICATORS DROP 4TH TIME IN 5 MONTHS

<P>
The government said Thursday that its chief economic forecasting gauge declined 
in June for the fourth time in five months, renewing concerns that the longest 
peacetime economic expansion may be nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators edged down 0.1% 
in June following a May decline of 1.3%, which had been the steepest drop in 19 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said they believed that the economy is headed for a downturn, 
based on the weakness already shown in the leading index and various other 
business barometers. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, the Bush Administration remained optimistic of reaching its 
target for overall economic growth of 2.9% this year, as measured by the GNP, 
although officials said growth would be lower than in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflationary Pressures 
</P>
<P>
In another report showing general weakness, the Labor Department said Thursday 
that productivity of American workers edged up a minuscule 0.2% in the 
April-June quarter after having fallen by 1.3% in the first three months of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The sluggish growth in productivity, defined as output per hour of work, was 
accompanied by rising employment costs. Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate 
of 5.2% in the second quarter after an even faster 6.2% rate of increase in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.1% drop in the June leading index reflected widespread weakness, with 
seven of 11 components declining. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest negative impact came from drop in raw material prices. While this 
is an indication of lessening inflation pressures, it also can mean less 
demand, which is viewed as a negative by the forecasting gauge. 
</P>
<P>
Other negative forces in June were a jump in unemployment claims; a fall in 
building permits; a speedup in business delivery times, also viewed as a sign 
of falling demand; a decline in the length of the average work week; a drop in 
orders for consumer goods, and a smaller backlog of unfilled orders for 
manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
Four indicators showed strength in June. The biggest plus factor was a rise in 
stock prices followed by higher consumer confidence, faster growth of the money 
supply and an increase in plant and equipment orders. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the leading index at 143.5% of its 1982 base of 100.

BENTSEN BILL WOULD LIMIT TAX BREAKS AFTER BUYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) introduced a bill 
Thursday to limit the tax refunds that corporations can receive from leveraged 
buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is designed to prevent companies from receiving tax refunds when they 
generate large losses simply by taking on the huge debts that result from LBOs 
and major debt restructurings. 
</P>
<P>
According to a study by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York firm 
specializing in leveraged buyouts, 17 companies that it acquired through LBOs 
paid $430 million in taxes the year before the takeovers but received $130 
million in tax refunds after the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"My proposal would put a stop to that," Bentsen said. "I don't think the 
federal government should write checks to corporations that replace equity with 
debt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limit Deductibility 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance Committee staff went to unusual lengths to explain the 
proposal, partly because a much more far-reaching tax proposal by House Ways 
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) in 1987 aimed at 
leveraged buyouts has been widely blamed for contributing to the October stock 
market crash. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bentsen waited until after the stock market closed Thursday to 
announce the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"There are proposals to limit the deductibility of corporate interest that are 
more dramatic than mine," he said in a statement. "I have opposed them and will 
continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
The measure would raise an estimated $200 million in the next fiscal year and 
$1.8 billion over a five-year period.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: SHINE SPOTLIGHT ON YOUR COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he first moved to Los Angeles four years ago, lighting designer Glenn 
Johnson was short on money but long on chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly broke, with a wife and a new baby, Johnson was desperate. He knew that 
wealthy homeowners needed his services to install custom lighting systems, but 
he had to find a way to reach them directly. 
</P>
<P>
"In my industry, image is everything," Johnson said. "It's kind of ridiculous, 
but it's a game you need to play." 
</P>
<P>
So, with his last few hundred dollars, Johnson rented a gray Mercedes 
convertible, put on his finest suit of clothes and drove through Bel-Air, 
looking for the biggest gated estates he could find. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew these people needed my lighting services," recalls Johnson, who had 
worked for his father's lighting design firm for 10 years before starting his 
own business, which he calls Lighting by Design. "I had to get out there and 
pound on the gates." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't have to do much pounding. When the housekeepers or gardeners saw a 
well-dressed man in a Mercedes drive up, the gates invariably swung open. And 
the servants usually listened to his sales pitch long enough to accept a 
brochure for the homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson wasn't gate-crashing, he frequently snooped around the largest 
residential construction sites he could find. By talking to other tradesmen, he 
found out who owned the luxury homes that would require custom lighting for 
works of art, swimming pools and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Little by little, Johnson's bold marketing techniques paid off. His client list 
has grown to include millionaire art collector Frederick Weisman, film director 
Steven Spielberg and film producers Richard and Lili Zanuck. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that the business is not going to come to you," Johnson said. "You 
really have to go out and get it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and others who have learned through experience say small-business 
owners who offer services instead of products are often reluctant to 
aggressively market themselves. Because they usually can't afford advertising, 
they rely on word-of-mouth referrals to build a client base. But even though 
they believe in their abilities, it is often difficult for them to promote 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Robinson and Julie Weisberger came up with offbeat marketing techniques 
to promote their West Los Angeles errand service, Julie &amp; Julie At Your 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
First, they checked the competition to see what other errand services were 
offering. They found upscale errand companies charging as much as $50 an hour. 
At the other end of the spectrum were messenger services that sometimes hired 
people whose sloppy appearance might offend wealthy clients. 
</P>
<P>
So the two Julies came up with a gimmick. They decided to dress in business 
attire no matter what they were asked to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We walk dogs in business attire," Robinson said. "Professional attire is our 
biggest selling point -- it's become our trademark." 
</P>
<P>
To reach busy professional people who might need their service, the Julies pass 
out flyers in Century City and in downtown Los Angeles. They spend hours 
visiting every floor of an office building, leaving their brochure with 
receptionists and anyone else who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
"When we passed out flyers in Century City, we didn't see anyone throw them 
away," said Robinson, who formerly worked for an agency that placed temporary 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Tanzman-Kaplan, a mother of two and an attorney who also owns a travel 
agency, said hiring Julie &amp; Julie has changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I literally feel like an octopus with 60 million legs," Tanzman-Kaplan said. 
"I'm so busy with the various aspects of my life that I don't have time to do 
the normal things like errands." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, she has relied on the Julies to wait for the flea exterminator 
and then take her dog for a flea bath. She also paid their $20-an-hour fee to 
have them stand in line to collect autographs of baseball players for her son's 
10th birthday gift. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing beepers so they don't miss a call, the Julies shop for groceries, buy 
and deliver gifts, stand in line for concert tickets and hand-address party 
invitations. Other jobs have included inspecting computer parts for a company 
experiencing quality control problems and helping a Westside attorney find the 
best private club to join. 
</P>
<P>
But they have drawn the line at being social escorts, chauffeurs or 
baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
Weisberger, who previously worked in public relations, said another successful 
marketing technique has been to write a personal thank you note to every client 
after each job. 
</P>
<P>
She said the clients appreciate the notes and frequently call to thank them for 
the thank you. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Get Organized 
</P>
<P>
A seminar called "How to Win the Paper Chase" is being offered Aug. 12 by 
professional organizer Beverly Clower. Clower, with Santa Monica-based Office 
Overhaul, will cover several aspects including how to create an effective 
workstation in space you already have, how to set up a functional file system 
and how to choose the right organizers and appointment books. 
</P>
<P>
The session costs $40 and runs from 9:30 a.m. until 1 p.m. It is scheduled to 
be held at the Holiday Inn Bayview Plaza, Redwood Room, 530 Pico Blvd., Santa 
Monica. For information and reservations call or write to Office Overhaul, 832 
11th St., suite 202, Santa Monica, Calif. 90403. (213) 393-1392. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Workshops 
</P>
<P>
Free tax workshops are being offered this summer and fall by the Internal 
Revenue Service in cooperation with the Small Business Administration and the 
Service Corps of Retired Executives. Half of the workshops deal with general 
business taxes; the other half are co-sponsored by the California State 
Employment Development Department and cover employment tax issues and forms. 
</P>
<P>
The workshops are held from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the federal buildings in 
downtown Los Angeles and Van Nuys. The next general tax workshops are scheduled 
for Aug. 10 and 11. The Aug. 10 session will be held in the Van Nuys Federal 
Building, 6230 Van Nuys Blvd., 4th floor conference room, Van Nuys. The Aug. 11 
session will be at the Los Angeles Federal Building, 300 N. Los Angeles St, 
Rooms 5035 and 5039. For information on these workshops and others call: (213) 
894-4574. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MARKETING TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Be bold and creative. Don't be afraid to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
Find a gimmick that sets you apart from your competition. 
</P>
<P>
Personal contact works best. Pass out flyers in places frequented by the kind 
of clients for which you are looking. 
</P>
<P>
Borrow and improve on marketing techniques that work for your competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Find out what your competition is charging and set your prices accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be shy about asking satisfied clients to recommend you to their friends 
and families. 
</P>
<P>
Be lavish with thank yous to clients whose business you appreciate.

U.S. FINES SOUTH KOREAN FIRM $34 MILLION

The U.S. Court of International Trade has fined Daewoo of South Korea a record 
$34 million for violations of U.S. customs laws, the Justice Department 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said Daewoo illegally and inaccurately reported the prices of steel 
and steel products it exported to the United States during 1980-1982 to avoid 
tariffs designed to curb the dumping of goods at below cost. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment is the largest civil penalty ever imposed for violations of the 
U.S. customs fraud statute and is separate from an earlier criminal case over 
the alleged incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The action concludes more than seven years of civil and criminal proceedings 
against Daewoo, one of Korea's biggest industrial conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trigger Prices' 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Daewoo pleaded guilty to criminal violations of the U.S. law in 
connection with nine shipments of steel products. 
</P>
<P>
The civil investigation was initiated after Daewoo's criminal conviction. It 
uncovered some 800 alleged violations in connection with 225 shipments. 
</P>
<P>
During 1980 to 1982, the Justice Department said, Daewoo routinely shipped 
steel to the United States and declared prices that were above the U.S. 
"trigger prices," the levels at which anti-dumping import tariffs are imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Trigger prices were established by the United States during the early 1980s. 
They are designed to monitor the prices of imported steel and detect the 
dumping of foreign steel in the United States at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
Steel suppliers to the United States have to declare steel prices upon entry of 
the products. If the declared prices were lower than the trigger prices, the 
Commerce Department could have initiated an anti-dumping investigation that 
could ultimately have led to the imposition of additional duties. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said Daewoo routinely reported prices above the trigger 
prices to avoid any extra duties. 
</P>
<P>
The previous biggest settlement was paid by Volkswagen in 1982, when it agreed 
to pay $25 million.

UNION SEEKING $50 MILLION TO PROMOTE EASTERN BUYOUT

The president of the machinists union at Eastern Airlines announced plans 
Thursday to raise $50 million from striking employees and small investors to 
promote a buyout of the strikebound airline. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Bryan, president of District 100 of the International Assn. of 
Machinists, which struck Eastern on March 4, pledged to put up $100,000 of his 
own money to start the fund. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is going to be a major breakthrough in putting the acquisition 
together," Bryan told union members. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan said the money would be organized into an investment trust by Shearson 
Lehman Hutton and possibly another investment banking firm and would be made 
available initially to investor Joseph Ritchie, who is trying to buy Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
"It is another source of money that would drive this thing home," Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's unions have backed Ritchie's bid for Eastern, which filed for 
bankruptcy March 9, five days after the IAM struck. 
</P>
<P>
Ritchie has pledged $25 million of his own money, and the AFL-CIO has pledged 
$65 million as a line of credit, Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan encouraged striking Eastern employees and sympathetic investors to pledge 
contributions by writing or telephoning the union. Those expressions of 
interest will be passed along to Shearson Lehman. The investment trust would be 
established later to accept those investments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Doing Well' 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp. of Houston, insists that the airline 
is not for sale. Management says it intends instead to rebuild Eastern as a 
smaller airline. Earlier this week, Eastern expanded its daily departures to 
350 from 225, and further expansion is planned. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryan said the company's plan for rebuilding Eastern is failing. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Airlines is not doing well," he said. "The more they fly, the more 
they lose."

$2.85-BILLION BID; 
</P>
<P>
AVON SNUBS JACOBS' TAKEOVER PROPOSAL 
</P>

<P>
Avon Products Inc.'s directors on Thursday spurned investor Irwin L. Jacobs' 
$2.85-billion takeover proposal and reiterated their belief that the cosmetics 
giant should remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
The move, the latest in a string of rejections the direct sales company has 
doled out to unwanted suitors, had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
But speaking from his headquarters in Minneapolis, Jacobs said he would take 
Avon Chairman and Chief Executive James E. Preston up on an offer to meet and 
discuss Avon's "business plans." 
</P>
<P>
Preston said in a letter to Jacobs that he would be willing to meet with the 
investor -- as he would with any major shareholder -- but "not to negotiate a 
sale of the company." An Avon spokesman also noted that Jacobs would not be 
allowed to meet with the entire board. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to take the high road in this thing," Jacobs said in a telephone 
interview. "I will very happily meet with him, which is more than others have 
gotten to do." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said he thought a meeting could be held within the week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Solo Approach 
</P>
<P>
Preston officially responded to Jacobs' offer by letter but phoned the investor 
before the letter was released. Jacobs described the call as "very friendly and 
amicable and one that I was pleased to get, and yet I wished the results were a 
little better." 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, Avon stock slid 62.5 cents a share to $35.875 in consolidated 
New York Stock Exchange trading, indicating dealers were skeptical of Jacobs' 
$41-a-share offer. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Jacobs tried the solo approach with Avon directors, who three 
months ago rejected a bid engineered by Jacobs' partner and Avon's rival direct 
sales company, Amway Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In his brief letter to Jacobs, Preston said the board "thoroughly" reviewed the 
proposal with its investment banker, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., at a regularly 
scheduled board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The board unanimously rejected your proposal," Preston said. "The board 
believes that the best interests of the shareholders would be served by Avon 
remaining an independent company and being allowed to execute its business 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' plan calls for selling Avon's retail unit, which includes the Giorgio 
Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern fragrance lines. 
</P>
<P>
Through a partnership with Jacobs, Amway controls about 10.3% of Avon's common 
stock; Jacobs controls about 55% of the Avon stock owned by the alliance, known 
as A-J Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Avon board rejected Amway's hostile $39-a-share takeover bid and 
indicated that it would resist future acquisition attempts. Days later, Avon 
also rebuffed overtures from Mary Kay Corp., parent of the door-to-door 
cosmetics seller Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying $2.25 billion for Avon's 54.91 million common outstanding 
shares, Jacobs also said he might redeem Avon's preferred shares at $33.50 
each, or a total of about $603 million, raising the price tag on Avon to 
roughly $2.85 billion.

NEW $3.4-BILLION BID FOR BRITISH ELECTRONICS GIANT

<TEXT>
<P>
General Electric Co. of Britain and Siemens AG of West Germany on Thursday made 
a fresh $3.4-billion bid for Plessey PLC and quickly boosted their stake in the 
British electronics company to 29.9%. 
</P>
<P>
GEC is not related to the similarly named U.S. company. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the joint bidders spent $495 million snapping up Plessey stock, 
bringing their holdings to the maximum allowed under British takeover rules. 
</P>
<P>
Plessey rapidly rejected the offer as "totally inadequate," saying the 
electronics giants had made "a major price miscalculation." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts conceded that the price was at the low end of Plessey's recent trading 
range but noted that the joint bidders were likely to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
The $4.46-a-share offer came one day after the British government announced an 
agreement with the bidders on conditions for renewing their bid for Plessey. 
</P>
<P>
The new offer replaced the original $2.8-billion bid that GEC and Siemens 
launched in November. That bid automatically lapsed in January when the 
government decided to investigate what impact such a combination would have on 
competition within Britain's electronics industry.

'SPECIAL' IS DIRTY WORD FOR THESE 2 COMPETITORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Born without a right hand, he proved the naysayers wrong and has already won 
nine games as a major-league pitcher in this, his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Mauled by a mountain lion near San Juan Capistrano at age 5, she is still 
struggling to overcome the partial paralysis and facial scarring that are 
remnants of the March 23, 1986, attack and hopes someday to become an eye 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
As far apart as they now stand in their aspirations, California Angels hurler 
Jim Abbott and El Toro schoolgirl Laura Small share several common traits: a 
gritty determination to conquer what others term disabilities and an intense 
desire not to be seen as special. 
</P>
<P>
It was this bond of mutual understanding that brought the pair together through 
correspondence in June, when Laura, now 8, sent a handwritten note to her 
baseball hero, and he quickly reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joyner Replacement 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 5," Laura wrote in large, printed letters to the man who displaced 
Wally Joyner as her favorite ballplayer, "I got attacked by a mountain lion 
here in Orange conty. I can't use my right hand and most of my right side is 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I think you're a great baseball Player. My brother David is 12 and is in 
love with baseball. He will turn green if you write back. I want to become a 
doctor, and seeing you makes me think I can be what I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
The response came just days later. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember hearing about your terrible accident from my home in Michigan," 
Abbott wrote. "I can also recall hearing some tremendous stories of how you 
have handled things since. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me when I say it's a tremendous privilege having someone look up to 
you at such a young age. You said in your letter you'd like to become a doctor. 
If you believe that now and work on it in the years to come, there's no reason 
you can't. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play baseball when I was growing up. The only people who may have 
doubted that possibility were those who couldn't accept that my handicap was 
not a hindrance. Remember, our handicaps are only problems in the eyes of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott's unexpected berth on the Angels' pitching staff this year thrust him 
into the national media spotlight, in large part because of his physical 
condition. But he has shunned that attention, seeking scrutiny instead of his 
pitching abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, Abbott has met and corresponded with handicapped children across the 
country who look to him for inspiration in breaking through what can appear to 
be insurmountable limits. It is a part of his life that he prefers not to 
discuss publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mead, the Angels' director of public relations, said: "It's incredible the 
number of letters he gets from handicapped kids, easily over a hundred (this 
season). And he's met with probably 45 or so of them when the team's on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"But he really wants to downplay it. He's not doing it for the publicity. He's 
doing it to help these kids." 
</P>
<P>
As eager as she is to meet Abbott in person, Laura said the words of his letter 
alone were enough to boost her occasionally sagging spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a lot in common," she said at her El Toro home. 
</P>
<P>
Laura said she felt bad for Abbott because of all the attention given in sports 
pages across the country to his physical condition and the unique way in which 
he throws the ball with his left hand, then quickly prepares to field by 
slipping his fingers into a glove tucked under his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Really Understood' 
</P>
<P>
"I really understood," Laura said of the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as difficult as some of the physical and legal challenges ahead appear, 
Laura and her family said it is her continual identification and scrutiny as 
"the little girl attacked by the mountain lion" that can be most frustrating 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
Having gone through 13 operations in the last three years, Laura has made a 
remarkably speedy recovery since the attack, her parents said. Undergoing 
regular physical therapy, she now takes ballet classes, participates almost 
fully in physical education at school and sports a potent, one-handed swing at 
wiffleball. 
</P>
<P>
The family also got a key legal boost in February when a Superior Court judge 
rejected the county's claims of immunity and refused to throw out Laura's 
lawsuit resulting from the lion attack at Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
The family will try to show that the county, which operates the park, failed to 
warn park-goers about the risk of wild animals and may have enhanced the danger 
through its own actions. 
</P>
<P>
Tougher than these legal and physical struggles, however, may be the close 
attention that the attack has brought her, Laura said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Meaning People 
</P>
<P>
Some schoolchildren tease her about her condition. Comments from well-meaning 
people drawing attention to the attack can upset her. 
</P>
<P>
And she was vehemently opposed at first to the idea of talking to a reporter 
last week for yet another news account of her story. "I'm so tired of being 
special! I just want to be ordinary!" she screamed at her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Jim said," Laura noted later, "you're not really handicapped, but 
other people think you are."

DANNEMEYER MEASURE TIES U.S. FUNDS TO AIDS REPORTS 
</P>

<P>
In a move condemned by homosexual activists, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton) introduced legislation Thursday that would bar federal funds to 
states that do not require clinics and doctors to confidentially report to 
public health officials the names of patients who test positive for the virus 
that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, similar to a defeated California ballot initiative that Dannemeyer 
sponsored last year, would also bar distribution of federal public health funds 
to states that do not require tracing of sexual partners of those found to be 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, known as HIV. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation faces tough sledding in the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment, which is headed by Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles). Several congressional aides said Thursday that they 
expect no major AIDS legislation to emerge from Congress at least until next 
year, and the prospects even then are uncertain because there is no consensus 
on what such a bill should include. 
</P>
<P>
At a Capitol press conference, Dannemeyer asserted: "What we are proposing . . 
. in this act is nothing more than the procedure our society has traditionally 
followed through our history to control a communicable disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately for all of us, we have set aside this traditional response, the 
cornerstone of which is reportability (of infected patients) to public health 
(officials) in confidence, and contact-tracing to control this epidemic in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
To support his view, Dannemeyer presented six physicians who represent medical 
organizations that advocate mandatory, confidential reporting. Also expressing 
support were an official of the Congress of Racial Equality, a black 
civil-rights group, and three other Republican congressmen -- Dan Burton of 
Indiana, Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia and Norman F. Lent of New York. Lent 
is the ranking minority member on the Energy and Commerce Committee and also 
serves on the health subcommittee with Dannemeyer and Bliley. 
</P>
<P>
However, the executive director of the nation's oldest homosexual rights 
organization immediately condemned Dannemeyer's plan, and Orange County's AIDS 
coordinator expressed serious reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"These individuals and organizations are promoting a particular ideological 
agenda in the false guise of protecting public health," said Thomas B. 
Stoddard, executive director of the New York-based Lambda Legal Defense and 
Education Fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Measures Called Intimidating 
</P>
<P>
"Mandatory measures frighten and intimidate populations that need to be 
encouraged to come forward for help, treatment and information," he added. 
"This isn't the subjective opinion of Tom Stoddard, this is the nearly 
universal view of the public health community in the United States. I would 
point out that doctors are not (necessarily) public health experts." 
</P>
<P>
Penny Weismuller, Orange County's AIDS coordinator, said: "At this point, I 
believe . . . that (Dannemeyer's bill) would be a hindrance to us because there 
will be many people who will avoid care and treatment until very late in their 
illness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that mandatory confidential reporting and the fear of 
discrimination . . . keep people from voluntarily entering the (health care) 
system early, it will adversely affect our ability to control the epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to mandating reporting and tracing procedures, Dannemeyer's bill 
would also require states receiving federal public health funds to: 
</P>
<P>
* Impose civil and criminal penalties for those who knowingly transmit HIV 
through sexual contact, the sharing of hypodermic needles, or the donation of 
blood, semen, breast milk or a body organ. 
</P>
<P>
* Institute routine, voluntary testing for HIV at hospitals for couples seeking 
marriage licenses and at clinics for family planning, drug abuse, sexually 
transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
* Implement mandatory HIV testing for convicts sentenced to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
At the federal level, the legislation would require the secretary of health and 
human services to treat HIV infection as a communicable or sexually transmitted 
disease for the purposes of federal law.

2 YOUNG SUSPECTS IN 'WEIRD' SEATTLE MURDER CASE HELD

<P>
Fifteen-year-old Lamonte Clayborne of Seattle often complained about doing 
maintenance work around the apartment building his mother managed. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor in the building once heard him talking about having his mother 
killed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the boy turned himself in to Garden Grove police as one of 
two juveniles suspected in the fatal stabbing of his mother, Ange May Reed, 41. 
Her body was found in her apartment last Friday, Seattle detectives said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Clayborne fled the low-income Seattle neighborhood in his mother's car soon 
after the killing, along with two friends identified as Dolphy Blue Jordan, 16, 
and a 15-year-old, both of Seattle, said Dan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King 
County, Washington, prosecutors office. 
</P>
<P>
That night, after Reed was found with multiple stab wounds to her face and 
throat, Seattle police got a call from the 15-year-old, who had fled from 
Clayborne and Jordan during a rest stop near the Oregon-California border, 
Donohoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle police then issued a bulletin alerting Orange County authorities that 
the pair apparently were headed for their territory, Garden Grove Police Lt. 
Chuck Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
About 8:15 p.m. Wednesday, Clayborne called Garden Grove police from a 
telephone booth at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
"He just said he was wanted for murder," Police Lt. John Wood said. Clayborne 
was arrested and taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jordan, who allegedly carried out the killing, surrendered to 
authorities in San Bernardino County, where he is in Juvenile Hall, Donohoe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clayborne and Jordan, who claim to be gang members, have agreed to forgo 
extradition and return to Seattle with detectives sometime next week to face 
first-degree-murder charges, Donohoe said. 
</P>
<P>
The third youth told investigators when he returned to Seattle that he had 
overheard Clayborne talking about killing his mother but didn't take it 
seriously, Donohoe said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges were filed against him because he had no direct role in the slaying, 
Seattle police spokesman Don Church said. 
</P>
<P>
One week before Reed's death, Clayborne told a neighbor that he wanted to find 
a gun to kill his mother, Donohoe said. A day before the slaying, he told the 
same neighbor that he wanted to hit the woman over the head with a baseball 
bat, throw her body out the window and toss it into a swamp in Everett, Wash., 
30 miles north of Seattle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Jordan attacked Reed in the hallway of her 
apartment about 2 p.m., after she got out of the shower. She was first hit over 
the head with a stick, police said, and then stabbed repeatedly with a kitchen 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old told police that he and Clayborne waited in the victim's car, 
Donohoe said. The murder weapon later was found on a Seattle freeway overpass, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan apparently has relatives in San Bernardino County, but it was unclear to 
investigators or Orange County authorities what brought Clayborne here, Donohoe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was believed they had some connections with California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hogan, the King County deputy prosecutor who filed the charges, said the 
pair apparently gave away Reed's car after they arrived in Southern California. 
Authorities recovered it at the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Clayborne and Jordan each are being held on $500,000 bail. If convicted, they 
could be sentenced to jail until age 21. Then, if tried as adults, they could 
face from 20 years to life in prison, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths have had some run-ins with the law, Hogan said, but have no history 
of violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a weird case," he said.

HICKS WON'T SEEK REELECTION AS DISTRICT ATTY. IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks, an institution in law enforcement after 
almost 23 years as the county's top prosecutor, said Thursday that he will not 
run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the district attorney's office 31 years and you grow attached to 
it. But I'm not going to run next year, and I'm not going to change my mind 
about it. It's time for me to do other things," said Hicks, who turned 63 on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks refused to answer questions about his decision, and emphatically refused 
to discuss a possible successor. But it has been widely accepted within the 
rank and file of the district attorney's office that Hicks favors Michael R. 
Capizzi, his protege and chief assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks had been a deputy prosecutor for eight years when the Board of 
Supervisors appointed him district attorney in 1966 to replace Kenneth 
Williams, who had become a judge. He ran for his first election in 1970, and 
has never had serious opposition since. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Hicks has said that integrity was what he hoped to make the 
hallmark of his office. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure in the 1970s, his office got indictments and eventually 
convictions of Supervisors Robert Battin for misuse of county staff, Ralph 
Diedrich for soliciting a bribe and Philip A. Anthony, who pleaded no contest 
to a campaign fund laundering misdemeanor. Anthony subsequently was defeated 
when he sought reelection. A political power broker, Dr. Louis J. Cella Jr. 
went to prison on fraud convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks' office also won conviction of Rep. Andrew J. Hinshaw, Republican 
congressman and former Orange County assessor, on charges of misuse of county 
staff in his successful 1974 congressional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But among current and former prosecutors, Hicks is most praised for the 
independence he allows them in handling cases. 
</P>
<P>
"If Cecil Hicks never showed up to work at all, he would still be the best 
prosecutor in California," one deputy district attorney told The Times in 1986. 
"The way he set this office up, we're the envy of prosecutors everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, who wrote at age 11 in a school paper that he wanted to be a prosecutor 
and "put bad guys in jail," said Thursday he had not expected to announce his 
decision for a few weeks, until after returning from a 10-day vacation visit to 
his daughter in Denver, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"But it looks like I've preempted myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks explained that he was speaking informally with friends at a meeting of 
state prosecutors in Santa Barbara Thursday afternoon when one of them casually 
asked if he planned to run again. It had been widely assumed by staff members 
in Hicks' office that he would not seek reelection in 1990, but Hicks had never 
said so publicly. 
</P>
<P>
But Hicks said he told the acquaintance, no, he would not run. 
</P>
<P>
By evening, word had spread back to the Orange County Courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"My secretary said the rumors were all over the courthouse that I had made an 
announcement, but I didn't," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
But there were so many media inquiries after he returned home Thursday night to 
Orange County, he said, that he decided he might as well make it official. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, who said he views Hicks as his mentor, all but announced his plans to 
run for district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood of my not running is slim to none, but any formal announcement 
will await a future date," he said Thursday night in Santa Barbara, where he 
also was attending the conference of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said he would hope that he would win Hicks' endorsement for the 
campaign, but quickly added that any announcement of that sort would have to 
come from Hicks himself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had known his boss would not seek another term, Capizzi 
replied, "I had anticipated the possibility, but nevertheless he's an 
institution in this county and I've derived much pride and pleasure in working 
for (him for) 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi praised Hicks for "the honesty, the integrity and the purity in which 
he has run the office. . . . The total atmosphere of having prosecuted those 
cases that should have been prosecuted are his greatest hallmark."

HEART ATTACK ON FREEWAY KILLS 79-YEAR-OLD DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 79-year-old Hemet man died of an apparent heart attack he suffered Thursday 
while driving with his wife on the Costa Mesa Freeway in Orange, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Willard F. Burch lost control of his car while northbound on the freeway, north 
of Chapman Avenue. His car careened across the car-pool lane, hitting the 
center divider. Burch's vehicle then was hit from behind by a car driven by a 
54-year-old Corona man traveling in the car-pool lane, a California Highway 
Patrol spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Burch died shortly after the 2:45 p.m. accident.

4 HELD, INCLUDING FATHER, SON, AFTER BIG COKE SEIZURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four men, including a father and his son, were arraigned on drug charges 
Thursday after being arrested in possession of 176 pounds of pure cocaine worth 
an estimated $30 million, Fullerton police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know this particular shipment was destined for Orange County," Fullerton 
narcotics Sgt. Danny Becerra said in announcing the second largest cocaine 
seizure in the department's history. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested Tuesday evening in a department store parking lot in 
Ontario, Becerra said, culminating a day in which detectives had tailed the 
four from the parking lot to a house in the Riverside County community of Mira 
Loma and back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residences in Lynwood and Mira Loma 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Marin, 23, and his father, Juan Serna Marin, 44, were arrested along 
with Johnny Estorga, 20, and Esteban Herrera, 48. The younger Marin resides in 
Lynwood while the other three men listed their address as a house on 56th 
Street in the remote Mira Loma community, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Each was being held in San Bernardino County Jail on suspicion of conspiracy to 
sell cocaine and possession of cocaine for sale. Bail was set at $1 million 
each, according to Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, Fullerton detectives staked out the parking lot of the Fedco 
department store on Archibald Avenue near the Pomona Freeway in Ontario. About 
10 a.m. Tuesday, they saw two men later identified as the Marins waiting as two 
other men dropped off a small pickup truck in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Marins drove a car and the late-model pickup with a camper shell to the 
house in Mira Loma, police said. Detectives said they then saw them loading 
packages from the house into the truck, which they drove back to the Fedco 
store and parked. 
</P>
<P>
After detectives watched the truck for several hours, they saw the Marins 
return to it accompanied by Estorga and Herrera. This time, they started 
loading the packages from the pickup into a late-model sedan. Officers then 
made the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
80 Plastic Packages 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine -- "pure stuff," Becerra said -- was wrapped in 80 plastic 
packages, each weighing one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds. The seizure was second 
only to a bust in April, 1988, which netted a 330-pound shipment of cocaine, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The four suspects arrested in the case appeared to be operating as part of a 
ring, but the two men who originally dropped off the pickup truck were not 
being sought by police, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
Becerra said news of the arrests was withheld for two days because the 
investigation into the case was still active and "we had some other things to 
do before we put it out."

RESIDENTS SEEKING DEAL WITH COUNTY ON ALICIA PARKWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A residents group in Laguna Niguel, angry that a section of Alicia Parkway 
still is not built, will drop its suit over the matter if the county guarantees 
construction will begin within eight months, a group spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But a county official said the group may be asking for more than the county can 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a 1987 agreement between a housing developer in Laguna Niguel and 
the county, in which the developer pledged to complete Alicia Parkway from 
Pacific Park Drive to Aliso Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group charges that the developer still is not doing anything to 
finish the artery, which the group says would help relieve traffic congestion 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the county's agreement is only giving us a road that's on paper," 
said Paul Christiansen, president of the Laguna Niguel Taxpayers Assn. "We 
don't want just another paper road in south Orange County. We have too many of 
those already." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8-Month Deadline Sought 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen said the residents' group is demanding that the county set a 
deadline of eight months from now for work to begin. If the county cannot get 
that guarantee, it should rescind its contract with the developer, Shapell 
Industries of Beverly Hills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel Taxpayers Assn., which has about 80 members, sued the county 
in May, charging it with breach of contract in its agreement with Shapell. In 
exchange for county approval for the 1,232-acre Country Village development in 
Laguna Niguel, Shapell pledged to build the missing segment of Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
The group won a default judgment on July 25 because the county failed to 
respond to the suit. Deputy County Counsel Edward N. Duran said that the 
failure to respond was an oversight and that he has petitioned Orange County 
Superior Court to set aside the default judgment. The matter is scheduled to be 
heard Aug. 18 before Judge William F. Rylaarsdam. In the meantime, Duran and 
Christiansen are scheduled to meet next Thursday to discuss terms of a possible 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen said his group also would require that the county obtain consent 
from the federal government within 90 days for Alicia Parkway to extend over 
federal land at the Chet Holifield Federal Building at Avila Road. 
</P>
<P>
Duran said Thursday that he had not yet seen the group's proposed settlement 
terms. But, he said, "it does seem like a lot to ask. . . . I'm not sure that 
it's possible for the county to promise some of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Both Christiansen and county officials said the federal government is literally 
a roadblock in the plans to complete Alicia Parkway. A key stretch of the 
missing link would cross federal land at the federal building, known as the 
Ziggurat. 
</P>
<P>
And an official of the federal General Services Administration recently told 
the county that the government is considering expanding the building and 
therefore does not want to yield land for highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen said that the county knew all along that federal approval was 
needed for use of the land and that, therefore, the county never should have 
entered into the contract with Shapell. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract has been a sham all along," Christiansen said. "They promised us 
a highway that may never be built." 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Shapell has been able to proceed with large-scale residential 
development "while all the taxpayers of this area get is more traffic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$7 Million for Expansion Work 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Shapell Industries last week dismissed similar criticism from 
Christiansen. The spokesman said Shapell had spent $7 million for expansion 
work on Moulton Parkway and Alicia Parkway since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen, however, said he sees no evidence of construction on Alicia 
Parkway. He reiterated his belief that the contract should be investigated by 
the county grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have in this contract is a real can of worms," he said.

NEIGHBORS TIRE OF LIFE ON SHORTCUT; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA RESIDENTS ASK COUNCIL TO DIVERT TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morning and night, the quiet, tree-lined neighborhood of Washington Square in 
Santa Ana turns into a traffic nightmare for residents. 
</P>
<P>
During weekday rush hours, a motorized ruckus disrupts the calm as commuters 
abandon the congested arteries of Bristol and Flower streets for shortcuts 
through the residential area, just north of Santa Ana's Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic is spilling into the neighborhoods," said Dion Baker, a real estate 
agent who lives in the neighborhood, on North Louise Street. "Drivers are 
turning the smaller streets into main thoroughfares." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Washington Square say their neighborhood -- bordered by 17th 
Street on the north, Civic Center Drive on the south, Flower Street on the east 
and Bristol Street on the west -- is becoming one big shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
But now, residents of Washington Square are declaring that enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6-Month Trial Period 
</P>
<P>
Residents want the Santa Ana City Council to pass a proposal allowing diverter 
markings to be painted at Washington Avenue at the intersections with Flower on 
the east and Bristol on the west. The diverters would be installed for a 
six-month trial period and would restrict traffic entering the neighborhood 
along Washington during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington Avenue (in the heart of the neighborhood) is a residential area 
that has been divided north and south by the traffic," said Tom Lutz, who lives 
on Freeman Street and is president of Washington Square Neighborhood Assn., 
which is petitioning the council for the diverters. "The cars have become a 
barrier." 
</P>
<P>
The diverter proposal was passed unanimously by the city's Traffic Commission 
in May. And the Planning Commission passed it with a vote of 5 to 2 in June. 
But the proposal has left some people fearing that a potential trend for 
traffic diverters could be ignited in other neighborhoods bordering 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
"No fair," said George Hanna, a Santa Ana planning commissioner who voted 
against the proposal. "It's preferential treatment," Hanna said. "It's like, 'I 
can drive on your street, but don't you dare drive on mine.' " 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood doesn't need diverters, said Don Sizemore, a planning 
commissioner who also voted against their use. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhood streets are for the whole city of Santa Ana," Sizemore said. 
"The neighborhood doesn't need any diverters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partial Diverter on Louise 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana traffic operations engineer T.C. Sutaria said the city has only a 
handful of streets with diverter markings that keep commuter traffic out of 
residential areas. Washington Square already has a partial diverter on Louise 
Street at Civic Center Drive. Other diverter markings are on 17th and Flower 
streets, 17th and Ross streets, and Lincoln Avenue and Grovemont Street. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has changed because of the traffic, said Washington Square 
resident Ed Magness, who has lived in his home on Towner Street for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ridiculous situation," Magness said. "We have people out there who are 
driving 55 in a 25 m.p.h. zone. And they don't care about stop signs. We need 
some form of enforcement."

WITH THIS SCHEDULE, THE TITANS' CHANCES LOOK MUCH BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A good portion of the Southeastern Conference awaits the Cal State Fullerton 
football team in seasons to come. But in the one just ahead, the schedule 
offers Fullerton something it hasn't had in recent years. This year, Fullerton 
has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
After playing two teams that made the top 20 during each of the past two 
seasons, Fullerton has a schedule this season that does not include any top 20 
or Southeastern Conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, picked by conference coaches to finish fourth in the Big West 
Conference, opens fall practice Monday when newcomers report. Veterans report 
next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, who finished 5-6 last season and tied for second in the Big West, 
will be preparing for a nonconference season against four opponents whose 
combined 1988 record was 17-27. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, however, Fullerton plays Auburn and Mississippi State, and Georgia and 
Mississippi State are on the schedule for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
As were games against Louisiana State and Florida in 1987, and against West 
Virginia and Wyoming in 1988, those games are scheduled by Athletic Director Ed 
Carroll because the schools offer large financial guarantees to visiting teams. 
That is a practice Carroll and Coach Gene Murphy have called necessary because 
of a limited football budget. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the focus is on this year's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can be competitive with the four teams we have this year," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The team with the best 1988 record of Fullerton's four nonconference opponents 
this season is Northern Illinois, a team Fullerton beat two years ago. Last 
year, Northern Illinois went 7-4. Fullerton opens the season against the 
Huskies Sept. 2 in DeKalb, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The next week, Fullerton has a home game against Cal State Northridge, a team 
that was 6-4 last year but did not play any Division I-A opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Week 3 will find Fullerton in Ft. Collins, Colo., to play Colorado State, in 
its first year under former Ohio State coach Earle Bruce. Colorado State will 
be trying to improve on last year's 1-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
The final nonconference game is against San Diego State.

Triathletes Scott Molina and Colleen Cannon, both of Boulder, Colo., headline 
the professional division of the Bud Light United States Triathlon Series event 
at San Clemente Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Molina leads the $160,000 grand prix triathlete rankings. Sunday's race is the 
ninth of 12 USTS races this year. The series finale is scheduled Sept. 30 at 
Hilton Head, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon, the defending USTS national champion, is the No. 2 woman in the 
triathlete rankings. Current women's series leader Sylviane Puntous of Kelowna, 
British Columbia, is not expected to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Other professional triathletes expected to compete include Harold Robinson of 
Santa Rosa and Paula Newby-Fraser of Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
All USTS courses feature a 1.5-kilometer (0.9-mile) rough water swim, a 
40-kilometer (24.8-mile) bicycle leg and a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) run. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente event will begin at 7 a.m. with the swim, starting and 
finishing at the San Clemente Pier. 
</P>
<P>
From there, athletes enter the transition area for their bicycles, and ride 
north on Pacific Coast Highway and east on Avenida Pico, making a loop back 
toward the pier. The competitors then run north on Coast Highway to Del Obispo 
Avenue and back, finishing near the intersection of Del Mar Avenue and Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The USTS, in its eighth season, is open to men and women 15 and older. Along 
with the professional division, the series offers an Elite Masters division, as 
well as open age-group divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 finishers in each division qualify to be invited to the USTS 
national championship at Hilton Head, S.C.

HUNTINGTON BEACH'S WAITE WEATHERS PAIN TO WIN BICYCLE RACE IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He had only two days rest after the nationals. He couldn't move his right arm 
over his shoulder, and he was just coming off two 200-meter heats. 
</P>
<P>
It sounded as if 24-year-old John Waite of Huntington Beach was making excuses. 
But this was after winning the gold medal in the kilometer bicycling event at 
the San Diego Velodrome during the opening day of the California State Games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a piercing pain shooting through his right shoulder on the start, Waite 
got out to the early lead and maintained it. He won in 1 minute 14.61 seconds, 
nearly two seconds ahead of San Diego's Arnie Baker (1:16.03). Peter McCurdy, 
Baker's teammate at Cyclo West, placed third at 1:16.60. 
</P>
<P>
And about those excuses? Turns out Waite claimed the gold in the same event one 
year ago in 1:10.03 -- more than four seconds quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"My start was slower than I would have liked because of my shoulder," Waite 
said. "I tried to ignore it and tell myself to go all out for three laps and 
let it hurt later, but that first pedal stroke, it felt like my arm was coming 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Waite, who builds racing bikes, also qualified first in the 200-meter time 
trial and 200-meter quarterfinals, putting him in today's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
At the nationals last weekend in Seattle, he placed among the top 12 before he 
was knocked out in the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun because the program itself is a little more relaxed," Waite said. 
"It's just that the way they promote the thing is conducive to going fast 
because you have a relaxed state of mind."

HOME-BREW: A CRIME NO LONGER; 
</P>
<P>
POPULARITY OF HOUSEHOLD BEER-MAKING IS NOW BUBBLING OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They can admit them now, these crimes of heart and palate: 
</P>
<P>
One purveyor of beer-making supplies tried importing malt extract from England, 
but was foiled when customs officials confiscated the contraband. Another 
gladly sold hops and yeast, but couldn't tell customers what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
They were fermentation fugitives at a time when home-brewing was a crime. But a 
decade ago, President Jimmy Carter gave these suppliers a sort of presidential 
pardon by signing the bill that changed their lives and increased their sales 
all at once. 
</P>
<P>
"If you walked up to the counter and asked how to make beer, we couldn't tell 
you," said Don Siechert, owner of Fun Fermentations in Orange. "We could sell 
some of the products, but that was all." 
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years that have passed since home-brewing of beer was legalized in 
February, 1979, the number of stores selling brewing supplies has doubled from 
about 1,000 to 2,000, with California in the forefront of many of these 
bubbling businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest jump in home-brewing's popularity came right after legislation was 
enacted that allowed adults to ferment up to 200 gallons of beer annually per 
household. But the recent growth of microbreweries and brew pubs has given the 
home-brewing industry yet another push. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Siechert says, his shop is doing so well this year that "it's 
frightening," thanks to a solid core of 800 local customers and an additional 
3,200 mail-order clients. 
</P>
<P>
For what was a shadowy group of illegal practitioners 10 years ago has grown 
into a population of 1.7 million brewers legally making beer at home -- and 
spending a stout $400 million each year in the process, according to the 
Boulder-based American Homebrewers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Bradford, association spokesman, said the number of home-brewers doubled 
annually from 1979 until 1985 before cooling off. It took the rush of boutique 
breweries and brew pubs that began to dot the nation in the mid-1980s to 
rekindle public interest in home-brewing. The brewing ranks began to rise again 
in 1987, with a 25% increase; 1988 showed similar growth. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 200,000 active fermenters, California is home to more brewers 
and home-brew clubs than any other state and boasts 45 of the 90 brew pubs in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But that wasn't always the case. Modern home-brewing had its start during 
Prohibition -- those dark, dry days from 1920 to 1933. It was a time when 
commercial breweries either shut their doors or manufactured root beer and near 
beer -- products that provided profits but no punch. 
</P>
<P>
Some, say home-brew experts, circumvented the law by selling five-gallon cans 
of beer wort, the liquid that ferments into beer, with labels that warned: "Do 
not take the lid off. Do not add yeast. If you do, this will produce beer. This 
is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
When Prohibition was repealed by the 21st Amendment, commercial brewing of 
beer, wine and spirits was again legal. Homemade wine was legalized too, 
according to Charlie Papazian, author of "The Complete Joy of Home Brewing" 
(1984). 
</P>
<P>
But a sloppy stenographer omitted three key words from the proposed amendment 
as it appeared in the Federal Register, according to Papazian's tome. In the 
line that legalized home-brewing of wine, the typist left out the word: "and/or 
beer." With that, a nation of home-brewers was doomed to decades of stealth. 
</P>
<P>
Stealth, because home-brewers and their suppliers weren't about to give up 
their labors just because you could buy a six-pack of Bud at the corner grocery 
store without fear of arrest. For, as Fred Eckhardt, considered the father of 
home-brewing, says: "Beer-making has been legal in the minds of home-brewers 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
The 1970s saw the beginnings of a strong home-brew movement, fostered in part 
by a rebellion against the major American breweries. 
</P>
<P>
"What really started happening in the 1970s was a qualitative rebellion against 
the major brewers," said Byron Burch, author of "Brewing Quality Beers" (1986) 
and owner of Great Fermentations in Santa Rosa. "When it's not 110 degrees, you 
want something different than a pitcher of Coors or Budweiser. . . . We're 
after beer that has a little more flavor and body." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, though, was that supplies were hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
Boiling kettles and kitchen thermometers could be picked up at any housewares 
store. But fermenters, bottle cappers, barley, hops, yeast and malt extract 
were much harder to come by. 
</P>
<P>
The slender selection of supplies that existed had to be imported, for no 
American companies would sell to small retailers of brew supplies, said Burch. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Burch said, only two varieties of hops were available. Now there 
are 15. Brewers could find only three kinds of grain; now there are more than a 
dozen available. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Carlson opened Wine Inc. in Akron, Ohio, in 1969 and spent the next 10 
years selling mostly wine-making supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"There was virtually no beer brewing at all," said Carlson, who operates one of 
the largest brew-supply distributorships in the nation. "It was illegal, though 
we did attempt to promote (it). We would bring in selected malt extracts from 
England. But we had a very difficult time with U.S. Customs, which would 
destroy shipments because they were brought in for something illegal. Those 
were not easy years." 
</P>
<P>
They're easier now, for the nation's home-brewers annually spend $250 each 
supporting their hobby. These brewers tend to make five gallons of home-brew 
each month and buy an additional 1 1/2 gallons of commercial beer in that time. 
</P>
<P>
They're usually in their mid-30s, married, own homes and have more than a 
college education. What they don't have in common is occupation. As one 
beer-watcher said, home-brewers "are your next-door neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
But they were a bit slow coming into the fold, even after home-brewing was 
legalized. Fun Fermentations, for one, found that it took a while for 
home-brewing to catch on and its customer list to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"People like us were a little bit afraid," Siechert said. "We continued as 
though the law had never been signed. We were afraid to get rambunctious. . . . 
And we had no good supplies." 
</P>
<P>
Fun Fermentations started out as a mail-order wine-supply business in the early 
1970s, operated by Brant and Kathi Horton out of an extra bedroom. By late 
1972, the business had outgrown the Horton's home, so the couple opened the 
store in Orange, which they sold to Siechert in January. Before buying Fun 
Fermentations, Siechert repaired computers, brewed beer and worked on and off 
at the store. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1985, Fun Fermentations' business was nearly all in wine-making 
supplies. But in the mid-1980s, brew pubs -- those small saloons that sell beer 
made on the premises -- began to crop up in Southern California. Such 
operations were legalized in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Brew pubs, like City of Angels in Santa Monica, piqued Californians' interest 
in home-brewing, industry watchers said, and the brew supply industry took off 
for the second time since 1979. In fact, brew-pub owners and master brewers 
often got their start at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Four years ago, 90% of the business was wine," Siechert said. "Now it's easily 
half and half. . . . We've never been busier than this year, and up until now, 
it's all been beer. Wine season doesn't start until September."

J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., under pressure from its banks, said Thursday that it 
had entered negotiations to reduce its $1.2-billion offer for Prime Computer 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Such a development might open the way for MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin to 
again enter the bidding for Prime, which it began last November and 
subsequently modified greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney said two of its banks asked it to obtain more financing after Prime, a 
Natick, Mass.-based minicomputer maker, reported a $19-million quarterly loss 
last week. Whitney, a New York-based venture capital firm, indicated that it 
has been unable to find that financing at its current offer of $21.50 a share 
for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we are willing to continue to seek financing at the $21.50 level, we 
believe, based on our efforts to date, that such financing will probably not be 
available from our current financing sources on a basis satisfactory to all 
financial participants," said Don E. Ackerman, a Whitney partner. 
</P>
<P>
Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan confirmed that the companies are negotiating 
possible changes in their June 23 merger agreement but declined to comment on 
how much the price might drop. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's directors agreed to the merger with Whitney while fending off MAI's 
hostile $970-million bid. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a computer firm controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, has 
since offered to buy Prime's minicomputer business for $525 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said if Whitney cuts its offer significantly, LeBow might 
be able to launch another bid for all of Prime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an ongoing soap opera on TV. It doesn't go away," analyst Jay 
Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said of the long takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
An MAI spokeswoman in New York said it had no immediate comment on Whitney's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, which has 11,200 employees worldwide, reported revenue of $1.6 billion 
last year, about one-third from minicomputers. The company also produces 
computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, a business that was 
substantially enlarged when Prime acquired Computervision Inc. for $435 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
As the minicomputer industry faces a general slump, Whitney's banks apparently 
believe that Prime needs more financing to withstand continuing losses and turn 
itself around.

CARDIS TRYING AGAIN TO SELL TUNEUP MASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the third time in three years, troubled Cardis Corp. is trying to sell its 
most valuable property, Tuneup Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Cardis, which moved from Buena Park to Cerritos early this year, applied 
Tuesday in bankruptcy court in Los Angeles to auction off its Tuneup Masters 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Cardis filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code last May. Tuneup Masters is not part of the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Cardis has come very near selling Tuneup Masters twice before, but both deals 
fell through without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The company has proposed a beginning bid of $55.8 million for Tuneup Masters, 
according to Andy Granatelli, Tuneup's chairman and CEO. Cardis bought Tuneup 
Masters from Granatelli and several partners in July, 1986, for about $58 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Tuneup Masters, based in Newbury Park in Ventura County, owns 240 quick-fix 
automotive stores in eight Western and Southwestern states. CHARLES STROUSE

WONG, AN AST FOUNDER, CUTS LINKS TO FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Albert C. Wong, one of three founders of AST Research Inc., cut his last 
management ties to the personal computer maker when he resigned Thursday from 
AST's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
An AST spokesman said Wong's letter of resignation gave no reason for his 
departure. In an interview, Wong said he feels "comfortable" leaving the AST 
board. "The company appears to be doing fine now," he said. "And I don't need 
to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Wong, who last November quit his job as AST's co-chairman and chief technology 
officer, has acknowledged that his business relationship with fellow 
co-founders Thomas C.K. Yuen and Safi U. Qureshey had grown strained during the 
past couple years -- a period of rapid growth for the Irvine firm. 
</P>
<P>
After resigning his daily duties at AST, Wong remained as a company director 
and retained a 16% ownership stake in the publicly held firm. He founded a real 
estate development company, DMK Development Corp., in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Wong's departure leaves AST with one vacant position on its five-member board. 
Joel Don, an AST spokesman, said the company has not decided on a replacement.

BREA MALL PANEL GIVES YOUNG ADULTS A GLIMPSE INTO WORLD OF MODELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONICA NEAL, Monica Neal, a recent graduate of Orange High School, is a 
regular contributor to High Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when some people are accused of having an "attitude," 24 young people 
on the Brea Mall Fashion Panel are using it to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"They do have to have an attitude," said Joni Rittner, the panel's fashion 
consultant, "because that's what modeling is. It's a feeling you have." 
</P>
<P>
The Fashion Panel is composed of 19 women and five men between the ages of 15 
and 24 who serve a 10-month term as representatives of the Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
The panel members, selected from nearly 50 applicants, met Monday for the first 
time to prepare for the mall's "Back to School" fashion show Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"The mall has fashion shows in the center court for all the stores, and we 
hired Joni as a fashion consultant to help prepare this one," said Kim Oylear, 
who is the assistant marketing director for the mall and the Fashion Panel 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"However, only a small amount of what the panel does consists of the shows. 
About 80% of their time goes into mannequin modeling and also charity work." 
</P>
<P>
Mannequin modeling consists of modeling clothes in a window or outside a store, 
and holding a single pose, as a mannequin would, for as long as 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Mannequin modeling is fun," said John James, a second-year panel member, 
"because later, people will come up to you and say, 'I saw you in a store 
window!' and I'll say, 'Yeah, I guess you did.' " 
</P>
<P>
James, 20, is a junior at Cal State Fullerton. He joined the Fashion Panel last 
year with his sister Tricia, 17, who will be a senior at Mater Dei High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been thinking about modeling," Tricia said, "and I told John about it." 
</P>
<P>
Said her brother, "I figured it would be fun, so I agreed to try out." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I'm going to continue (modeling), but this is a good 
introduction," Tricia added. "I've gone to agencies, and all they want is your 
money. Here, you get a taste of modeling by doing shows and mannequin 
modeling." 
</P>
<P>
There is no fee to belong to the panel, but, as the saying goes, time is money. 
</P>
<P>
"The panel members put in about 10 hours a month, two of which are spent in a 
monthly meeting, but the other eight vary," Oylear said. 
</P>
<P>
"Meetings can cover anything from hair to makeup to putting together a 
portfolio, and we usually have a guest speaker." 
</P>
<P>
The only real cost the models incur, then, is in the time they contribute. 
</P>
<P>
"They do a lot of volunteer work with the community," Oylear said. "At 
Halloween, they help pass out candy in the mall. At Christmas, they help the 
Salvation Army charity drive, and they can help with charity fashion shows, 
such as the ones put on by the (California) Angels and their wives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, though, the members are getting ready for the "Back to School" show. 
Their first week of preparation included four three-hour meetings to learn the 
basics of runway modeling and to set up routines. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to divide you up into groups," Rittner told the participants on the 
second night. "And you are going to like each other. That's an order," she 
added, jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
Tricia James said panel members do become friends but said that the main thing 
she got out of the panel last year was experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you get to know a lot of people," she said. "I've met people I 
wouldn't have otherwise. And the knowledge I've gained . . . that's what really 
helped." 
</P>
<P>
Experience and, more important, exposure appear to be what this year's models 
hope to gain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to achieve a better viewpoint in modeling and get to know the 
responsibilities involved in modeling and dressing models for shows," said Mark 
Thomas, 15, a sophomore at Walnut High School. 
</P>
<P>
He learned about the Fashion Panel from his grandmother, who found an article 
about it in a local paper. "She knows I'm interested in the field," said 
Thomas, who has taken drama and acting classes. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his fellow panelists have also enrolled in classes to prepare for their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Parker, 15 and a freshman at El Dorado High, has participated in drama. 
She hopes to become an actress. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to learn everything there is to know about modeling, and I want to 
continue in the field for a while," she said. "Hopefully, someone will see me 
and I'll get into acting." 
</P>
<P>
Like Parker, Colene Purrington, 17, a senior at Sunny Hills High, is pursuing a 
modeling career as a steppingstone to acting. 
</P>
<P>
"I love drama, singing and dancing. I love the theater," Purrington said. "I 
feel really comfortable right there on center stage, and I love making people 
happy. It's something I want to do for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Though she was not on last year's panel, Purrington has had modeling experience 
at her place of work -- Windsor Fashions at Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"They started to do mannequin modeling, and that's how I got started," 
Purrington said. 
</P>
<P>
And while her goal may be to make people laugh, when she is a mannequin model, 
the roles are usually reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"People constantly want to make you laugh," she said. "They'll touch you, tell 
jokes or say you have a run in your nylons. So it's almost like a game against 
them, to not laugh or move." 
</P>
<P>
Other panel members, such as Marcella Manzanedo, also have had some experience 
in modeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried out for Facefinders," said the 16-year-old Savanna High senior. "You 
send in your picture, and if they like the way you look, they'll call you in to 
model your own clothes for them. If they like you after that, they'll have you 
model their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too nervous," she said, adding that since she has joined the Fashion 
Panel, "I'm not embarrassed anymore. That's the one thing: You can't be 
nervous, or you won't get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Courtney Cates also joined the panel hoping to overcome her nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I joined to become more graceful," said the 16-year-old Sunny Hills 
junior. "I play sports -- soccer and tennis -- and my mom says I walk like a 
jock, which isn't very flattering for a girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of by accident that I heard about the Fashion Panel. I've always 
wanted to see what it would be like to be a model. And now I have the chance."

There are two kinds of dreams: those that will be nothing more than dreams, and 
those that become reality with just a little bit of effort, a bundle of hope 
and a lot of luck. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't believe in dreams coming true, then why do you make a wish when 
blowing out your birthday candles? Why bother wishing upon a star? Everyone, 
even the skeptic, has to "dream a little dream. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hot Topics asks: "Did you ever have a 'dream come true'? What was it?" 
</P>

SUNBURNED SOLDIERS SPURRED CREATION OF SUNTAN LOTION EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although sunbathing has been a popular pastime since bathing suits covered more 
skin than they left bare, sunscreen lotions are fairly recent inventions. And 
it wasn't fear of wrinkles that led to their creation. 
</P>
<P>
"The suntanning industry did not really begin until World War II, when the 
government needed a skin cream to protect GIs stationed in the Pacific from 
severe sunburns," writes Charles Panati in his book "Extraordinary Origins of 
Everyday Things." 
</P>
<P>
"One physician who assisted the military in developing the sunscreen was Dr. 
Benjamin Green. Green believed there was a vast, untapped commercial market for 
sunning products. 
</P>
<P>
"After the war, he parlayed the sunscreen technology he had helped develop into 
a creamy, pure-white suntan lotion scented with the essence of jasmine. The 
product enabled the user to achieve a copper-colored skin tone, which to Green 
suggested a name for his line of products. 
</P>
<P>
"Making its debut on beaches in the 1940s, Coppertone helped to kick off the 
bronzing of America." 
</P>
<P>
The top-selling single record to date, according to the Guinness Book of World 
Records, is "White Christmas" by Irving Berlin, with 30 million sales of the 
Bing Crosby version (recorded May 29, 1942) and more than 100 million sales of 
other versions. 
</P>
<P>
The highest claim for any "pop" single is an unaudited 25 million for "Rock 
Around the Clock," recorded April 12, 1954, by Bill Haley and the Comets. 
</P>
<P>
The single record "Do They Know It's Christmas?" -- written and produced by Bob 
Geldof and Midge Ure and played by an all-star ensemble of British musicians 
under the name Band Aid -- sold 3.6 million copies on discs and cassettes by 
May, 1986, in the United Kingdom and 7.5 million more worldwide. The $52 
million in proceeds went to the Ethiopian Famine Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The best-selling album of all time is "Thriller" by Michael Jackson, with 
global sales in excess of 38.5 million copies as of Aug. 1, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The ancient Egyptians worshiped cats, and a person could be executed for 
killing one," writes Barbara Seuling in her book "Elephants Can't Jump &amp; 
Other Freaky Facts About Animals." 
</P>
<P>
"In 525 B.C., when the Persian King Cambyses II attacked the Egyptian city of 
Memphis, he flung cats over the walls of the city. The people inside were so 
horrified and frightened by this bold act that they surrendered immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Crocodiles, too, were worshiped by the ancient Egyptians, and kept in temple 
pools, adorned with gold earrings and jeweled bracelets. Sometimes, if a slave 
was uncooperative, he was tossed into the pool." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus."

PIANO HAS BEEN KEY TO FULFILLMENT IN A LIFE FILLED WITH HURDLES

It's a heady experience for any pianist to solo at Washington's Kennedy Center, 
to sit in the spotlight and risk it all on one performance, with no one to 
share the blame for a missed note. 
</P>
<P>
For Tim Baley of Anaheim, performing a piano solo at the Kennedy Center in June 
was all the more remarkable. This is a man who was once told by a doctor that 
he should be institutionalized for the rest of his life because of his mental 
retardation, a man who plays by memory because he can't read music fast enough, 
a man who for the first decade of his life had trouble getting his arms to work 
right and still sometimes has a "flutter" in his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
But when he sits at the piano, reaches into his memory and extends those long, 
solid fingers over the keys, his physical and mental shortcomings fade into the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
In the living room of the Anaheim condominium that is home with his parents, 
Baley plays what he calls his "patriotic medley": "This Land Is Your Land," "My 
Country 'Tis of Thee," "America the Beautiful," "Battle Hymn of the Republic," 
"This Is My Country" and "God Bless America." Afterward he grins widely as his 
listeners applaud. 
</P>
<P>
Baley, 37, has played piano twice on the White House lawn and once at the 
Pentagon. He has given recitals abroad, from Poland to New Zealand. And in 
June, there he was at the Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the first International Very Special Arts Festival, which 
featured 1,000 performers in 231 events held at 27 sites around the nation's 
capital. Very Special Arts, an educational affiliate of the Kennedy Center, was 
founded in 1974 by Jean Kennedy Smith to provide opportunities in the arts to 
what the group calls the "mentally and physically challenged." 
</P>
<P>
Baley was one of three representatives from California at the concert, and the 
only one from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time there," Baley said. "I saw . . . George Bush . . . Kenny 
Rogers and Crystal Gayle." 
</P>
<P>
But if there was joy upon arrival in Washington, there has been a lot of 
heartbreak along the way for Baley and his parents, Rosemary and Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Baley was in labor for 48 hours before delivering her son, who 
suffered various illnesses as an infant. By the time he was to enter elementary 
school in Grand Junction, Colo., Baley was so hyperactive that school officials 
suggested he be tested. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told that the lower left lobe of his brain had suffered severe damage, 
apparently caused from the forceps at delivery," Rosemary Baley wrote in a book 
she privately published 10 years ago. A doctor said her son would never be able 
to read or write and should be institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
For the next few years, he took special education courses while living at home, 
as he has done for most of his life. But in 1966, at age 14, he entered a newly 
opened hospital in Denver for brain-damaged and emotionally disturbed children. 
There, Rosemary Baley said, doctors reversed an earlier diagnosis by other 
physicians and told her that her son had cerebral palsy, a central nervous 
system disorder caused by brain damage. Baley spent two years in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Like other cerebral palsy sufferers, he had trouble controlling some of his 
physical movements. For years, he was unable to bring his fingers together, let 
alone make two hands fly over a piano keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
But the parents had noted over the years that their son was noticeably calmed 
by music. Both parents sing and Jerry Baley has taught music at several 
Christian colleges. Now retired, the Baleys travel with Tim to the recitals he 
gives by invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Baley said he became interested in the piano at age 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a special hospital in Denver," he said. "They had a piano in there 
and I kept going over to the piano every so often. And there was a lady there, 
one of the staff members, who had an ear for music. . . . She started me 
(playing), and that's where I started to blossom." 
</P>
<P>
But Baley said he "didn't really start playing" the piano at a higher level 
until 1971, when the family moved to Boise, Ida., and he entered another 
special education school. After playing piano at the school, teachers said he 
was so good that they sent him next door to play at a physical rehabilitation 
center -- the start of what proved to be years of concerts at churches, senior 
citizen gatherings and special events in this country and abroad. He has had 
piano lessons from several professional teachers, including his father, and he 
eventually overcame the inability to bring his fingers together. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years he has learned to read and write as well. In recent years he has 
even designed the Christmas cards his family sends. He said he is too slow 
reading music to play piano from a score; instead he listens to a tape of a 
performance, memorizes it and practices over and over to make the song his. 
</P>
<P>
But as his performing career has picked up speed over the years, the special 
problems of a mentally impaired man have remained, according to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager in Colorado, Baley enjoyed swimming nightly at a pool in the 
condominium complex where his family lived, his mother said. But one night a 
neighbor who frequently used the pool ordered him to get out and never to use 
it again while he swam. Her son was crushed, Rosemary Baley said. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, while living in El Paso, Baley bicycled across the border into 
Mexico. He became thirsty and asked a gas station employee if a $5 bill was 
enough for a soda. The man said yes, gave him the soda and took the $5 without 
giving him any change, leaving Baley penniless. "He has no concept of money and 
never will," Rosemary Baley said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in spite of all the setbacks, there have been acts of kindness. The Baleys 
tell of church members who have helped care for their son over the years, of 
teachers qualified to give musical instruction to the handicapped who worked 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Baley's meeting with his hero, Liberace. In 1982, the television 
show "Fantasy" arranged for the Baleys to drive the motor home in which they 
tour the country, giving concerts, to Las Vegas, to visit the Liberace museum. 
To Baley's surprise, he was invited to sit at Liberace's piano and play a tune. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape shows Liberace entering the room, walking past startled tourists 
and surprising Baley by sitting with him at the piano and playing a duet. 
</P>
<P>
The Baleys' concert trips are financed by donations, or by honorariums from 
those hosting the concert, by listeners dropping an offering in a box and by 
sales of cassette recordings of Baley's concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Baley said he looks forward to traveling and "very much" to performing. "I 
don't get nervous or anything," he said. "I always enjoyed playing in front of 
thousands of people."

Joseph DeVincenzo, a former top aide to Mayor Edward Koch who left City Hall 
under a cloud of allegations that he ran a patronage mill for the mayor, was 
indicted today on perjury charges, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
DeVincenzo, former special assistant to Koch and head of the mayor's Talent 
Bank, was questioned under oath by the state integrity commission and denied 
his office awarded jobs in exchange for political support for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
DeVincenzo was indicted on perjury charges by the Manhattan district attorney's 
office, officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
The Talent Bank, created to promote the hiring of minorities and women, was 
also believed used by political bosses to reward the party faithful. Members of 
the state Commission on Government Integrity called into question DeVincenzo's 
testimony in private before the panel on two days in July, 1988, and one day in 
January.

A lesbian minister who said she was attacked by two homophobic "skinheads" 
abruptly resigned today amid speculation that she fabricated that and another 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Griffis, 27, assistant pastor at the Metropolitan Community Church, 
claimed that on July 28 she was dragged into a car by two skinheads who beat 
her and threatened to kill her because she was a lesbian who helped AIDS 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before, Griffis reported being attacked in her home for the same 
reasons by an intruder with a shovel.

A 20-year-old man on vacation from the Sacramento area disappeared during a 
predawn swim in the surf along Will Rogers State Beach today, prompting a 
search by lifeguards and a Coast Guard helicopter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the missing man and his friend, also 20 and from the Sacramento 
area, were not immediately released. The two drove from their motel in Los 
Angeles to Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades early today and decided 
to go swimming about 4:45 a.m., county Lifeguard Lt. Randy DeGregori said. The 
man had been drinking heavily, his friend said.

Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani told the United States today that he is 
ready to help free hostages in Lebanon but that Washington should abandon 
military solutions and pressure Israel to free a kidnaped Muslim cleric. 
</P>
<P>
"I address the White House: There is a solution for Lebanon, a solution for 
freeing the hostages," Rafsanjani said at a mass prayer meeting in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a sensible attitude, and we will help solve the problems there so that 
people of the region may live in peace and friendship." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, asked about Rafsanjani's proposal, told reporters in 
Washington: "When you see a statement that offers hope about the return of our 
hostages, I want to explore it to the fullest." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, in his first foreign policy remarks since taking office Thursday, 
said the United States is wrong to seek military solutions for the hostage 
crisis in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot solve anything by bullying and arrogant approaches," he said in a 
sermon broadcast on Tehran Radio. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organization suspended a death threat 
against American hostage Joseph J. Cicippio, 59, on Thursday but said the 
reprieve would last only several days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Appeals to Iran 
</P>
<P>
The United States had pressed Iran to use its influence with Shiite Muslim 
groups in Lebanon to prevent the killing of Western hostages after the reported 
hanging Monday of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 44. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that if the United States wants to end the crisis, it could 
pressure Israel to free the Muslim cleric it kidnaped from south Lebanon a week 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The captors of both Higgins and Cicippio have demanded freedom for Sheik Abdel 
Karim Obeid, a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be received well in the world if you demand that a criminal (Israel) 
give up its crime," Rafsanjani said. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also questioned whether U.S. military action in Lebanon could be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
"How stupid you are. . . . You have been to Lebanon once, and you saw how the 
Lebanese kicked you out," he said, referring to the 1983 killing of 241 U.S. 
Marines by a truck bomb in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Army commander Michel Aoun, Israel and Iraqi Baathists "are raining 
shells on Lebanon. What can your fleet do to stop that? Is there any place in 
Lebanon not hit by a shell already?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warships on Alert 
</P>
<P>
U.S. warships are on the alert near Lebanon and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani heaped scorn on the U.S. military buildup, saying Washington is 
backing the wrong side in what he termed a clear-cut case of Israeli 
intransigence. 
</P>
<P>
"The clear point is that a government (Israel) has formally admitted that it 
has committed a crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Iran did not know Higgins, who was serving as a U.N. peacekeeping 
officer when he was captured in February last year, and he could be innocent 
although his captors described him as a spy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know who (Higgins' captors) are, or whether they are good people or 
not. But we know that the people of Lebanon are oppressed and they cannot be 
condemned for no reason," Rafsanjani said.

A judge today upheld a West Virginia law that allows the state to revoke the 
driver's licenses of school dropouts, a law used as a model for pending federal 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Kanawha County Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib said the law is based on the state's 
interest in keeping teen-agers in school, "is not unreasonable and withstands 
any constitutional challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The case involved an appeal filed by Michael Means, 17, of Charleston, who lost 
his license after he dropped out of junior high one month after his 16th 
birthday. Means, whose 16-year-old wife is expecting their first child this 
month, says he cannot get a job to support his family without driving 
privileges.

GINGRICH DENIES WRONGDOING, HITS ALEXANDER

Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) defended himself today against growing allegations 
of House rules violations, saying the charges come from "enraged" Democrats led 
by "an almost irrational" Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, the combative assistant House Republican leader, told a television 
interviewer that Democrats have vowed revenge since he spurred the ethics case 
that led to the June resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are people who are enraged that I insisted on investigating Jim 
Wright and I think, frankly, they will try to do virtually anything to try to 
prove that you can't stand up to that kind of power and get away with it," he 
said on ABC's "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander already has filed a complaint against Gingrich with the House Ethics 
Committee and said Thursday he is preparing to amend the charge to include as 
many as 200 additional rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
Information brought "to my attention within the last several days . . . 
suggests that my initial complaint may have only scratched the surface . . . of 
potentially unethical, illegal or criminal conduct by Mr. Gingrich," Alexander 
wrote in a letter to Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), the ethics panel 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich dismissed the threat Friday, saying, "I think in terms of the 
substance of the charges, what you have is an almost irrational Democrat in 
Bill Alexander who is wandering around wildly saying things. I'm comfortable 
that after the Ethics Committee has investigated it that they are going to say 
that there's nothing to the charges." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's panel is expected soon to start an investigation of Gingrich based on 
Alexander's original complaint about the financing of a book by the Georgia 
conservative. The committee has hired the same Chicago law firm that conducted 
the case that prompted Wright's resignation in the face of 69 ethics charges, 
also involving a book deal. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander did not offer immediate details about the additional allegations he 
plans to make.

Britain has granted political asylum to three Chinese diplomats and is 
considering an application from a fourth, the Home Office said today. 
</P>
<P>
The four sought asylum after the Chinese government's military crackdown on 
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in early June. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those granted asylum were first secretaries in the science and 
technology section of the Chinese Embassy in London. They were not named. 
</P>
<P>
The third was Ning Hongshan, a second secretary in the education section who 
walked into a police station in London's West End in June and asked to stay in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth diplomat, whose name was not disclosed, was a middle-ranking 
official, a Home Office spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 Chinese diplomats in Western countries have defected since tanks 
and troops ended the demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men Square on June 4.

At her last appearance in Parliament before its long summer break, Prime

</P>
<P>
When Sir Geoffrey Howe rose to answer questions in his new post as leader of 
the House of Commons, Conservative members waved, cheered and roared their 
welcome in a blunt signal to Thatcher of their disapproval at the way he had 
been treated. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of the end for Mrs. Thatcher," one said. "We are cocking 
a snook (thumbing our noses) at her." 
</P>
<P>
In the reshuffle, Britain's biggest since 1962, two ministers resigned, 
Thatcher fired two others and made changes to 13 of the 21 Cabinet posts. It 
was meant to wrest the political initiative back from the resurgent Labor 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it left critics mocking the reshuffle as a shambles and the government 
wearing the "divided" tag it used to happily pin on Labor's frequent public 
squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
The way she handled the reshuffle, after a catastrophic performance by the 
Conservatives in May's European elections, revived controversy over Thatcher's 
domineering leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Parliament rose, a senior Conservative member accused her of being 
"dogma driven." In a speech, Nicholas Winterton warned the new Cabinet to 
address "the great gulf which remains between government and electorate." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's relations with Howe and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 
have been strained for months over such issues as the battle against inflation 
and economic issues involving Europe -- where she is at odds with her European 
Community partners over monetary union, progress toward a single market and 
workers' rights.

STAUBACH APPEALS TO BUSH;

<P>
EX-GRID STAR FEARS EASTERN IS DOOMED

Pro football Hall of Famer Roger Staubach has expressed concern to President 
Bush about the Eastern Airlines strike and bankruptcy reorganization, warning 
that continued sales of Eastern assets could bring the airline's eventual 
demise. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Bush dated Aug. 1, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback asked 
that a meeting be set up as soon as possible between representatives of the 
Eastern pilots union and Roger Porter, Bush's domestic policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Staubach wrote that his interest in the Eastern situation stemmed from his 
personal relationships with many striking Eastern pilots. He said that group 
includes the best man at his wedding, football teammates and classmates at the 
U.S. Naval Academy, where Staubach also was a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
From his conversations with those friends and from "all other accounts," 
Staubach wrote, "it is obvious that the Eastern situation is far more than a 
traditional labor-management dispute. It goes to the very root of the free 
enterprise system within our country." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said he had no comment on Staubach's 
letter or speculation that the former football player might get involved in 
making a buyout offer for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Staubach, who runs a commercial real estate company in Dallas, did not 
immediately return a call seeking comment today. It was not immediately clear 
whether Staubach's interest in Eastern could extend to a possible bid for the 
crippled airline. 
</P>
<P>
Another sports figure, former Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, made a 
buyout bid for Eastern in partnership with the unions in early April. But the 
takeover agreement between Ueberroth and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's 
parent Texas Air Corp., later fell apart over the unions' demand that Lorenzo 
be removed from daily control of the airline.

JOBLESS RATE DROPS .1% TO 5.2% FOR JULY; 
</P>
<P>
169,000 NEW JOBS ADDED DESPITE SLOWING ECONOMY

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate fell one notch to 5.2% in July as businesses 
added 169,000 new jobs despite the slowing economy, the government reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the growth was again found predominantly in the 
service-producing sector of the economy, which added 140,000 of the new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate declined from the 5.3% reported for June. The government also 
revised its figures on new jobs created in June to 250,000, up sharply from the 
180,000 reported in July. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a soft economy but one that appears to have been stronger in July than 
in May and June," said chief economist Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic 
Advisers Inc. "This certainly should ease fears of imminent recession." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Boskin, the Bush Administration's top economic adviser, said the report 
"suggests the economy is continuing to expand." He said the July job growth 
brought to 20 million the number of new jobs created during the record long 
expansion, which began in late 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report contained further evidence of persistent wage inflation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Earnings Climb 
</P>
<P>
The department said hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers 
increased 0.8% in July -- about twice the rate analysts had predicted -- while 
average weekly earnings climbed by 1.7%. The jump in hourly earnings followed 
two months of modest increases. 
</P>
<P>
Goods-producing industries added 29,000 new positions as construction posted a 
gain of 35,000 jobs, helping to offset a decline of more than 10,000 jobs in 
the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing posted a modest gain of 3,000 jobs in July after three months of 
declines, according to the Labor Department's survey of business 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 117.4 million Americans were at work in non-farm jobs last month, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees in private 
industry increased by 0.3 hours to 34.9 hours. The factory workweek held steady 
at 41 hours and overtime in July averaged 3.9 hours a week, up from 3.8 hours 
in June, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in hourly earnings brought average hourly pay in the private sector to 
$9.70 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from $9.62 in June. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly earnings rose to an average of $338.53 from the June average of $332.85. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youth Force Expands 
</P>
<P>
The government said the summer expansion of the youth labor force in the last 
four months has totaled about 3.1 million, about the same as recent years 
despite a significant drop in the youth population. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate fell in July despite a dip in the number of Americans at 
work from 117.5 million to 117.4 million. The rate fell because the 169,000 new 
jobs were created in a month in which the civilian labor force -- the number of 
people who have jobs or are looking for them -- fell by 146,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 140,000 job growth in the service-producing sector came despite a 25,000 
drop in the number of government jobs.

ARCO SAYS NEW NORTH SLOPE WELL COULD BE BIGGEST FIND IN 10 YEARS

<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. said today that a new well it is testing on the Alaskan 
North Slope could prove to be one of the largest discoveries in the United 
States in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Arco's stock jumped $2.25 to $100.375 on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Tests on the Point McIntyre well near Prudhoe Bay showed oil flowing at the 
generous rate of 5,400 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
The total daily output of Alaskan oil is about 2 million barrels, with many 
single wells producing around 2,500 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
The average well in the United States yields fewer than 10 barrels a day. Many 
of the fields in Texas and other states are mature. 
</P>
<P>
An Arco spokesman said preliminary tests indicated a high recovery rate that 
could ultimately reach about 300 million barrels during the life of the well. 
</P>
<P>
Arco said in June that tests on its first well in the area indicated flow rates 
as high as 5,300 barrels a day. The figures released today are for a second 
well in the area.

Newly combined Time Warner Inc. may sell its Scott, Foresman and Co. textbook 
unit, a Wall Street source and industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Schoolbooks are not a core business of Time," the Wall Street source said. 
"Other businesses sell directly to consumers, and schoolbooks are sold to 
schools, school boards. Therefore if anything is sold Scott, Foresman seems 
like a logical first choice." 
</P>
<P>
Time executives signaled as long as two years ago that Scott Foresman was a 
non-core business, and potential buyers may already have been contacted, 
analyst Ken Noble of Paine Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Time said final decisions on possible asset sales had not been 
made, and he emphasized that none of Time's core businesses, such as its 
magazines or cable-television operations, are being considered as candidates 
for divestment.

Riding on brisk demand for luxury models, imported car sales in Japan hit a 
monthly record in July, marking the 67th consecutive year-on-year rise since 
January, 1984, the Japan Automobile Importers' Assn. reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The association said sales jumped a whopping 53% over a year ago to 17,339 
units, bringing to 98,657 units the total number of imported cars sold in the 
first seven months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
But despite brisk demand for imported cars in Japan, foreign cars accounted for 
a mere 3.1% of the total Japanese auto market. 
</P>
<P>
West German cars continued to dominate the imported car market in July with 
10,653 units, accounting for 61.4% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of U.S.-made cars jumped 97.6% over a year ago to 2,567 units, accounting 
for 14.8% of the imported car market, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of British cars totaled 1,426 units, up 72.6%, while those of French and 
Swedish vehicles gained 68.6% and 52.2% to 1,062 units and 898 units, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for Italian cars fell 7.4% to 348 units, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic sales, including Japanese-made and imported vehicles, hit a record 
558,495 units in July, up 15% over a year ago. Passenger cars accounted for 
414,840 units, up 16.3%, the association said.

A judge has granted a temporary restraining order to halt plans for the 
scheduled Aug. 14 middleweight fight between Iran Barkley and Michael Nunn, 
which was to have been broadcast on Home Box Office. 
</P>
<P>
State District Judge Jack O'Neill granted the order Thursday; it had been 
sought by lawyers for Al Boulden, Barkley's trainer until June 21. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, who lives and trains in North Hollywood, is champion of the International 
Boxing Federation, and Barkley, who lives in the Houston area, is the former 
World Boxing Council middleweight title holder. 
</P>
<P>
Boulden is seeking about $47,000 he claims he is owed for past fights and 
$50,000 he said he would have earned for the Nunn bout. In the suit, Boulden 
claims that he was preparing Barkley for the fight at the time he was 
terminated. 
</P>
<P>
The judge will hold a hearing Thursday to determine if he will issue a 
temporary injunction sought by Boulden. Barkley and his manager, John Henry 
Reetz, are named as defendants in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Reetz told the Houston Post from his training camp in Reno, where the fight is 
scheduled to be held, that there never was a contract with Boulden. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at best it is a doghouse beef, so we are not very concerned with it," 
Reetz said. "As far as a restraining order and injunction against the fight, I 
don't think the attorney general of the state of Nevada will allow that." 
</P>
<P>
Boulden contends in the suit that he is responsible for Barkley's "rejuvenated 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Boulden also claims that he did not receive his full 10% share of Barkley's 
prize money from fights. 
</P>
<P>
He asked in court that Barkley and Reetz be restrained from preparing for the 
fight and from appearing on any HBO broadcast relating to the bout.

The NCAA Council has informed the University of Arizona that it has not reached 
a decision regarding the eligibility of Chris Mills, who transferred from 
Kentucky, the school said today. 
</P>
<P>
The council, meeting in San Diego, told the university that it is referring the 
matter to the infractions committee for review later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona officials sent the NCAA an appeal in late July asking that Mills, a 
6-foot-7 swing man from Fairfax High in Los Angeles, be declared eligible for 
the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, the center figure during the NCAA's investigation of Kentucky, was 
declared ineligible at Kentucky earlier this summer after the NCAA levied 
sanctions against the Kentucky program. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA alleged that former Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent $1,000 
by courier to Mills' father, Claud, during the recruitment of Mills.
