Talent agents, on your toes:

When U.S. Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne) appeared on a British public affairs 
TV show recently, his straight man -- make that fellow guest -- was noted 
Chinese dissident physicist Fang Lixhi, who was allowed to leave China after he 
took refuge in the U.S. Embassy for months. 
</P>
<P>
On the air they got down to serious foreign policy. But Dreier warmed up the 
act by telling Fang that his name was the same as that of comic Phyllis 
Diller's fictitious husband. 
</P>
<P>
"He laughed hysterically," Dreier wrote us. 
</P>
<P>
Uh-huh. And after all those overseas tours, tens of thousands of people in 
dozens of countries still think Bob Hope was the Secretary of State. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Goerner of Pomona is the first to answer -- and in verse, yet -- our 
question, what to do with the Spruce Goose?

A tuck under the wings, a little work around the propellers, they could pass it

bombed by a low-flying orange crate? 
</P>
<P>
As they say, or attempt to say, there's nothing certain in life but negative 
patient outcome and revenue enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
If you divined "death and taxes" out of that, you qualify to attempt this word 
problem, from a memo circulated at a major downtown firm: 
</P>
<P>
"Effective today, employee parking fees will be reduced at all ... employee 
parking facilities ... The total amount you pay for parking each month will 
remain the same." 
</P>
<P>
The company is The Times. The memo obviously did not pass through our usual 
gantlet of alert editerz. 
</P>
<P>
Give up? Like a dishonest mystery writer, we left out the key clue. The city of 
L.A. imposed a 10% tax on downtown parking. So the company thoughtfully cut 
parking fees to its employees by that same 10%, so, voila, everybody pays the 
same amount as before, except 10% now goes to the city instead of the company.

Tipple d'Or is on tour: a solid gold bottle of Pinch, 86-proof Scotch in an 
18-karat container (California bottle deposit not included). 
</P>
<P>
After being displayed in local liquor and discount stores, the bottle settled 
into more fitting digs in Beverly Hills Friday for a multiple sclerosis 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that gold-bedazzled people will reflexively empty gold from their 
pockets has worked. The Pinch bottle has raised $402,000 for MS research, and 
the goal is $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
It's called the most expensive bottle in the world -- $115,000 -- but if you 
count contents, in 1985, a member of the Forbes family plunked down $157,500 
for a bottle of 18th-century plonk: a 1787 Chateau Lafite claret, its label 
initialed by Thomas Jefferson. Within a year, the cork had dried out from 
exposure to display lights, and the wine was undrinkable. But we were still 
amused by its presumption.

BARR STRIKES OUT SINGING THE ANTHEM

I was appalled and repulsed by the rude, thoughtless and inconsiderate 
performance of our national anthem by Roseanne Barr at Jack Murphy Stadium in 
San Diego. It wasn't bad enough that she agreed to "sing" in the first place 
knowing full well that she couldn't; but to follow her "performance" with an 
inappropriate gesture and spitting was totally unacceptable and an insult to 
those in the stadium and the rest of our great country as well.

WHAT DO WE NEED AND HOW MUCH?; 
</P>
<P>
SUDDENLY, DEFENSE THEORY SEEMS MORE URGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Washington and Moscow started talking peace, some military analysts warned 
that fending off regional wars might some day make the Cold War seem a piece of 
cake. With the confiscation of neighboring Kuwait by Iraqi troops this week, 
law-abiding nations must start taking the warning seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear deterrence meant -- and to a lesser extent still means -- having the 
right number of nuclear missiles ready to retaliate after a surprise missile 
attack. Choosing the right number engaged some of the best strategic minds in 
the country, and even though it always seemed an imprecise science, it worked. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, there is a right number of troops, tanks, ships and planes that will 
persuade tyrants like Iraq's Saddam Hussein that grabbing off neighbors and 
their oil fields has more risks than benefits. In theory, the United States and 
its allies can develop a conventional deterrence that would work as well as 
strategic deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
But, particularly in a region like the Middle East with its politics of 
suspicion and long history of religious and tribal hostility, practice is a 
long way from theory. There are severe limits to the number of locations where 
weapons and other supplies can be stashed (pre-positioned, as the Pentagon 
calls it) for use in an emergency, as they are in North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization countries. Moving quickly is more difficult in the Middle East 
because the instinct of royal families in the region always has been to bargain 
their way out of trouble rather than shoot their way out. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, conventional deterrence will not only be more complicated than the 
Cold War variety but also more expensive. About 20% of the Pentagon budget goes 
to strategic forces. 
</P>
<P>
There is an impulse to dismiss costs when the stakes are oil supplies for most 
of the industrial world, but costs cannot be ignored. Washington's deficit is 
already big enough to damage the economy and is still growing. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress got part of the message of Kuwait last week -- that 
there are still troublemakers in the world and the nation must not cut defenses 
too far or too fast. The rest of the message is that defense forces must match 
the threat these hoodlums pose. The next question is whether the B-2 and other 
weapons designed to fight a global nuclear war are the right weapons to deter 
regional aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing deterred Hussein this week. The nearest American aircraft carrier was 
several days from the scene of the invasion. A few thousand American troops 
conceivably could have reached Kuwait in days, but not enough to take on the 
130,000 Iraqi soldiers who invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A practiced military planner could list the right number of troops, planes and 
weapons it would take to persuade a wholly reasonable commander of 130,000 
soldiers he would lose if he started a fight. But theory is the easy part of 
conventional deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
And the troops need not, and ought not, all be Americans. Where they should 
come from is where the planning gets tough. Even more difficult is negotiating 
permission to put them close enough to flash points to deter a dictator 
contemplating combat. 
</P>
<P>
So there will be nothing easy about conventional deterrence. Fortunately, other 
nations with a stake in peace in the Middle East, including the Soviet Union, 
have rallied to President Bush's call for what amounts to a quarantine of Iraq. 
That should buy time to adjust, if the luck of the industrial nations holds 
out. But Washington must use that time to start planning for fundamental shifts 
in its defense structure to deal with the new future -- the future that 
suddenly seems a lot more urgent and menacing and a lot less theoretical and 
academic.

STARK'S IDEA IS BASICALLY A RACIST ONE; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESSMAN'S COMMENT ABOUT SECRETARY SULLIVAN IS STEREOTYPING AT ABOUT ITS 
WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even if Rep. Pete Stark winds up giving Health and Human Services Secretary 
Louis Sullivan the unqualified apology to which the Bush Administration's only 
black Cabinet officer is entitled, there's a lesson to be learned -- and 
committed to memory. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's coarse and offensive characterization of the secretary's position on 
various health-policy issues was not simply intemperate or lacking in civility; 
it was, in fact, a patronizing, objectively racist affront. 
</P>
<P>
Stark, an Oakland Democrat who chairs a Ways and Means subcommittee on health, 
has become increasingly frustrated with Sullivan's opposition to abortion and 
national health insurance. He believes the former head of Atlanta's Morehouse 
School of Medicine has altered his views to accommodate those of the White 
House. At a press conference Thursday, the congressman said that, because of 
Sullivan's positions on these issues, he "comes as close to being a disgrace to 
his profession and his race as anybody I have seen in the Cabinet." Stark is 
white. About 6% of his constituents are black. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan took understandable exception to such remarks, as did many of Stark's 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Friday, the congressman said on the 
House floor, "To the secretary, I have to say (that) I blew it. I should not 
have brought into the discussion his race, because it obscures the fact he is 
carrying on a bankrupt policy." 
</P>
<P>
No. That's not it. 
</P>
<P>
Stark should not have raised the the question of Sullivan's race because it is 
irrelevant and, in this context, insulting. The notion that skin color, 
religion, ethnic origin or sex obliges a person to hold particular ideas is as 
hurtful as any other racist idea. 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in Stark's original comments is the suggestion that Sullivan "does not 
know his place," which is in support of the policies the congressman thinks are 
good for African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Stark is entitled to his views; he is not entitled to insist that Sullivan or 
anyone else share them as a consequence of some imagined racial duty. 
</P>
<P>
That is the line at issue here and Stark owes Secretary Sullivan an immediate 
apology for crossing it.

My grandmother just lost her food stamps. The government took them away because 
her Social Security check increased $10 a month. She and her friends in the 
elderly project are just barely getting by. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and have you seen those homeless people out in the street? Literally 
millions of them there are -- not a bite to eat. In the meantime, we, the fed, 
are being sold food in our markets that's laced with cancer-causing pesticides. 
Hell, here in L.A., they have a quicker, new improved method: They spray the 
stuff right on us. 
</P>
<P>
And how about all those folks with AIDS? Now and then, I swear I hear a 
politician mention that in a speech, but I suppose most of the big money goes 
to building those nuclear power plants -- you know, the ones that leak 
plutonium into our soil, into our air. 
</P>
<P>
For years I've been wondering just what it would take for Americans to get 
really angry. Now, I finally have my answer: Roseanne Barr. Congratulations, 
honey! Do you realize that you've succeeded in waking up a country of comatose, 
back-seat patriots? Quite a feat, I must say. 
</P>
<P>
This is the type of patriotism that requires the least amount of time, energy, 
thought and true concern for the people of this country (who, incidentally, are 
the country. A flag is wonderful; a song is very nice, but the people are the 
country, right?) This is truly the fast-food equivalent of standing up for 
one's nation. 
</P>
<P>
If you care that much about the honor of America, why stand around screaming 
about an irreverent comedienne? Get out in the street and get your feet wet . . 
. or you're wasting your breath. But hey, I've got things to do. Off with her 
head! Now, where did I put that darned Constitution?

TROUBLES IN CHILDREN'S SERVICES DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the resignation of the director of Children's Services ("Chaffee Quits as 
County Chief of Child Services," Part A, July 20) and the threat by the state 
to take over the care of neglected and abused children in Los Angeles County, 
we witness another diversionary ploy that masks the real problem -- there is no 
sincere commitment by the state and the local government to provide quality 
care for children at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect are not 
innocent bystanders but have a vested interest in the changes in the 
department, the low morale of Children's Services workers and the quality of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 25 years, we have seen many changes in the approach to these 
children. Initially, the Probation Department had the responsibility for 
juvenile delinquents and for abused and neglected children. It was concluded 
after several years that neglected and abused children should not be treated in 
the same facilities as those juveniles who had committed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
This led to the separation of neglected and abused children from those children 
who were juvenile delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, this did not work either, so neglected and abused children were 
removed from the Probation Department responsibilities and placed under the 
Department of Public Social Services. The primary responsibility of DPSS was 
Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The reorganization of this department 
to meet the needs of these abused and neglected children did not result in any 
appreciable changes in the treatment of these children. 
</P>
<P>
It was thought that a newly created department where the focus was primarily 
these children would provide, finally, the care that had been sought over the 
years. The Department of Children's Services, with the Children's Commission, 
its oversight body, became the new combined thrust. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the first director's tenure was short because of ongoing 
problems with the Children's Commission, hence little was done. The second 
director inherited a fledgling department with problems. It is no surprise, 
then, that he had to resign due to continuing problems. 
</P>
<P>
The state as "Parens Patriae" (the legal concept that imposes the duty on the 
state to provide for children who are neglected and abused) has serious 
problems intervening in behalf of its children. But, there are millions of 
dollars from the federal government that support this "state parenting system." 
Perhaps, the federal government can provide the atmosphere for the state and 
the local government to meet and "stop their blame-oriented behavior" and get 
on with the business of making a sincere effort to provide cooperation and 
organizational structures that help these children.

JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUDGE SOUTER AND SUPREME COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The retirement of Supreme Court Justice William Brennan triggers the shocking 
reminder that, at the constitutional level, the law is merely an art form, 
which, through the medium of opinion, endeavors to give expression to what is 
right and good. So much slack exists in constitutional law that it is, in fact, 
the personal biases and prejudices of the justices, masquerading as reason and 
logic, that control the ultimate decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Brennan stood out as a beacon in this turbulent subjective sea of 
opinion, guiding us away from the rocks and shoals that would destroy 
individual freedom and derogate the dignity of human life. With his retirement 
the invocation of the Supreme Court might well be changed from: "God save this 
Honorable Court" to "God save the American people."

TROUBLES IN CHILDREN'S SERVICES DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several months ago, I left the Department of Children's Services after 17 years 
as a child social worker for a new career with less stress. I never thought 
that I would be writing in defense of DCS, but here goes. 
</P>
<P>
It is very easy for state officials to say that they have "no confidence" in 
DCS. We didn't have much confidence in them either. 
</P>
<P>
Child social workers have caseloads in excess of 65 children per worker; 
Spanish-speaking social workers have a lot more. That is far above the 
negotiated contract levels. It takes money to hire qualified social workers and 
the state is forever screaming how poor it is when asked for money. One cannot 
expect social workers to cover every child. There just aren't enough of them to 
go around. That also includes licensing workers. Administrators, including 
Robert Chaffee, have been asking for money both from the county Board of 
Supervisors and the state. Each of those entities blames the other for lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators can only do a job when they have adequate staff to cover the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
I can speak from experience. At one time I had a caseload in excess of 100 
children. When I left several month ago, it was 56 and climbing. There is no 
possible way one person can cover that many children in a month, particularly 
if some of those children are placed at the far corners of the county. 
</P>
<P>
There are reports to write that are mandated by law; paperwork required by the 
Feds; paperwork required by the state; paperwork required by the county. It 
takes 10 pieces of paper to place one child and almost as many to remove 
him/her. On a good day, you are lucky that only one of your caseload children 
elects to run away. 
</P>
<P>
If there is trouble in a foster home, it could be months before a worker finds 
out, simply because they don't have the time to see that child. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the only time a worker discovers a problem is because the child ran 
away, trashed the foster parents' home, or a brave child calls and complains to 
his teacher or law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>

The problem is not having enough staff with smaller caseloads to see the

IMAGINATION IS THE BOND IN AN UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: THE LATIN AMERICAN STYLE OF 'MAGIC REALISM' MIRRORS A WORLD WHERE THE 
INCREDIBLE IS REAL AND REALITY SURREAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGARITA MONDRUS ENGLE, Margarita Mondrus Engle, an agronomist and writer, 
lives in Fallbrook, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Magic realism" is one of the greatest and most influential literary movements 
of the 20th Century. Its exponents, such as Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa, have done more than bring an indigenous Latin 
American style to the attention and acclaim of the rest of the world; their use 
of magic realism also has served to explain Latin America to the world. 
</P>
<P>
In Latin American fiction and cinema, people vanish or materialize, communities 
that have remained unchanged for millennia are altered abruptly and 
inexplicably. Land crabs flood houses, an old man grows wings, a beautiful 
woman goes out to hang up laundry and is swept away by the wind, tangled in her 
clean, white sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Such transformations are perfectly credible in the context of Latin American 
existence. People disappear, places are carried away by change, children are 
born in antiquity and wander unprepared into the Space Age. 
</P>
<P>
I have a Central American friend. The stories she tells do not ring true to the 
North American ear. Sometimes she says she is 23 years old, sometimes 25. 
Sometimes she insists she has no brothers, only sisters. Sometimes she admits 
that her brother is a guerrilla in the mountains. Sometimes she tells tales of 
terrible danger and suffering. The next day she cannot face those memories and 
denies them. 
</P>
<P>
North Americans assume she is lying. She is not. Her reality differs from North 
American reality. She does not know her age because she cannot read her birth 
certificate. She rejects her brother because his very existence presents 
unimaginable dangers. She denies her suffering because it is the only way she 
can survive another day. Her real life is devised in the style of magic 
realism. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, much of the impact of magic realism stems from the grim aspects of 
Latin American reality. In "Chronicle of a Death Foretold," Garcia Marquez 
narrates the tale of a murder everyone knew would happen. They knew when it 
would happen, and where, but they did not stop it. 
</P>
<P>
But magic realism can be gentle and mystical as well as chilling. The magical 
side of this realism has been felt by anyone who has entered the rain forest at 
dawn, by anyone who has walked alone through the mist in search of dry 
firewood. By anyone who has paddled an old dugout canoe through a downpour, or 
spent months in the mountains tending livestock, or pulled the weeds from a 
corn field hour after hour, day after day, season after season. 
</P>
<P>
Think about camping. Now you have an idea what it feels like to live in rural 
Latin America. Comforts are lacking, but the mystery of nature is pervasive. 
You cannot escape from yourself or your surroundings. You are afraid of wild 
animals and strangers. You believe your own ghost stories. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez has explained that his work resembles wild imagination only 
because Caribbean reality itself is like the wildest imagination. 
</P>
<P>
My mother was born and raised in a small city on the south coast of Cuba. The 
tales she tells are strange to North Americans, so she rarely shares them: A 
man who lived in a cave and sacrificed children. A spinster who stole the 
plaster Infant Jesus from the arms of St. Anthony's statue and refused to give 
it back until the saint found her a husband. Fifteen-year-old girls married off 
to 60-year-old men. Parrots on the roof echoing the voices below. People 
dancing until they fall into a trance. One uncle struck down by lightning, 
another taken away by the secret police. A prison in the dungeon of an old 
Spanish castle. The leg of a dog chewed off by a moray eel. Families divided by 
war. Paradise lost. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no boundaries between reality and dreams," wrote Miguel Angel 
Asturias, the great Guatemalan author whose books, such as "Men of Maize," give 
equal credence to ancient Maya myths and contemporary political conflicts. "The 
magic of our climate and light," Asturias wrote, "gives our stories a double 
aspect -- from one side they seem dreams, from the other, they are realities." 
</P>
<P>
When Garcia Marquez accepted the Nobel prize, he credited Latin American 
reality as the source of creativity: "All of us creatures of that unbridled 
reality have had little to ask from imagination because our biggest challenge 
has been the lack of conventional resources to render our lives credible." 
</P>
<P>
Those who experience the incredible write accordingly, and what results is the 
world's most wonderful literature.

ARE RAIDERS FINALLY GETTING FAIR SHARE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the 20,000 or so Raider fans left in Los Angeles, I would like to 
thank Chris Baker and The Times for the daily coverage of the Raider training 
camp in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Raider fans actually get an in-depth article every day, just like the Ram fans, 
and it seems like the players and management are taking the time to speak with 
Mr. Baker. This could not always be said when Mark Heisler, who spent half of 
his space knocking the Raider organization, was covering the team.

Congratulations to Bob Oates on an excellent column regarding Al Davis and 
Walter O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
It's pretty clear that Davis is the key to getting the Coliseum upgraded to a 
modern playing facility. If he leaves, as Oates explained, the arena will 
continue to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
Let's press forward in a last-ditch attempt to keep the Raiders here. The city 
will benefit in the long run, as will Southern California as a whole.

O'Malley-Davis? 
</P>
<P>
Pick up a 33-year-old copy of the Los Angeles Times sports section and give it 
a once-over: not quite the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Francis O'Malley changed your sports section. He pioneered baseball's 
presence across the continent and in no small fashion paved the way for other 
sports franchises to "Go West, young man." 
</P>
<P>
He asked no more of New York than he did here -- "Give me a place to build a 
ballpark and I'll build it" -- and, oh, what a ballpark. Not one financed by 
the taxpayers, but with his own money and that which he could borrow. 
</P>
<P>
He put this town on the nation's sports pages, not the gossip columns. No one 
gave him $10 million to fly from Brooklyn to see if he might allow the 
taxpayers to build him a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Any similarity between Walter O'Malley and Al Davis must be attributed to 
fiction.

Thank you, Roseanne Barr, for proving my point. For years I have been telling 
friends that, instead of a talented comedienne, you are a disrespectful swine 
who uses brash vulgarity to mask your own self-pity and feelings of insecurity. 
To paraphrase the man, it is better to be thought a pig, than to open your 
mouth, spit on hallowed ground and remove all doubt.

SILVEIRA SHOOTS A 71, LEADS BY ONE AT MEMPHIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Silveira overcame two shots into water hazards to shoot an even-par 71 
Friday and hold a one-shot lead midway through the St. Jude Classic at Memphis, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Silveira, who set a course record with a nine-under-par 62 for a three-shot 
lead Thursday, completed two rounds over the 7,006-yard TPC Southwind course at 
133, one shot ahead of Buddy Gardner and Loren Roberts. Gardner shot 69 and 
Roberts 68. 
</P>
<P>
Silveira, a former University of Arizona All-American, had four birdies, two 
bogeys and a double bogey on day when play was interrupted by lightning and 
rain. He found the water on No. 4, taking a bogey, and on No. 11, where he had 
the double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out there grinding away," Silveira said. "I putted well, but I didn't 
hit my iron shots close enough. I had a lot of 20-30 footers." 
</P>
<P>
The second-year PGA Tour player, whose best finish is a 10th in the Deposit 
Guaranty Classic this year, was at even par for the day when he missed a 
one-foot tap-in for par on the par-3 14th. He got that stroke back when he 
birdied the 18th from 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know when you're going to play good," Silveira said. "It's 
day-by-day out here, as you can see with a nine-shot difference today." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner managed to offset a bogey-4 at the 186-yard fourth hole with three 
birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, competing after a three-week layoff, got his game together after a 
double bogey on the 146-yard 11th hole, which was his second hole of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a bogey and a double bogey in the homestretch, former British Amateur 
champion Kitrina Douglas held her lead after two rounds of the British Women's 
Open, in Woburn, England. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas shot a two-under-par 71 in the second round, played in intense heat, 
and reached the 36-hole mark with a 140 total. 
</P>
<P>
One stroke behind her was Helen Alfredsson of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the round, Douglas led by five-shots, but she had a bogey on the 
15th and a double-bogey on the 17th. 
</P>
<P>
"In these conditions you take the bad breaks with the good, so I have to be 
satisfied," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas had five birdies in the first 11 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Former champion Corinne Dibnah of Australia also had trouble at the 17th, 
carding a nine after hitting a shot into the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Muffin Spencer-Devlin, who was two shots off the lead after an opening-round 
71, hit two tee shots out of bounds off the first tee and recorded a 
quadruple-bogey nine on the hole. She dropped five more shots in the next five 
holes and ended the second round with an 81. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Charles shot a six-under-par 66 to claim a one-shot lead over Dewitt Weaver 
and Harold Henning after the opening round of the Paine Webber Invitational at 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, winner of two Senior PGA Tour events this season, had four birdies on 
the front nine and added a fifth with a 50-foot putt on the 436-yard 13th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer, designer of the Pipers Glen course, and tour money leader Lee 
Trevino were in a group at 70 that also included Dave Hill, the winner the last 
time this event was staged, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ronan Rafferty of Northern Ireland shot a 67 and kept his three-shot lead at 
the halfway mark of the PLM Open at Malmo, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Rafferty, who tied the course record with a 64 Thursday, had a 36-hole total of 
131. That is 13 under par on the 6,892-yard Bokskogen course and the fourth 
lowest 36-hole score on the European Tour this season.

NEW-WAVERS 'ESCAPE,' LAND IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was bound to happen, sooner or later. We've already had a touring "British 
Invasion" and "Summer of Love" revival packages, in which several key groups 
from the same era got together, some two decades later, and returned to the 
road for a last hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
Now, perhaps a little prematurely, comes "Escape From New York," a traveling 
road show starring pioneering American new-wavers who burst out of New York's 
fabled CBGB punk-rock club 15 years ago and shocked the music industry out of 
its mid-1970s slumber. 
</P>
<P>
They are the Ramones, ex-Blondie singer Deborah Harry and three-fourths of the 
Talking Heads: Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz (the latter two 
appearing with their side group, the Tom Tom Club). 
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean that "Escape From New York" performers -- whose 
two-month U.S. tour brings them to San Diego tonight for a concert at San Diego 
State University's Open Air Theater -- are just another bunch of has-beens 
hoping to relive their glory days. 
</P>
<P>
They are all still making records and enjoying as much commercial success as 
they ever did, if not more. The Ramones' last album, 1989's "Brain Drain," was 
their all-time best-seller. Harry recently returned to the charts for the first 
time since 1982 with her first two solo albums. And the Talking Heads have yet 
to put out an album that doesn't go either gold or platinum. 
</P>
<P>
"In our cases, at least, age doesn't matter," said Ramones drummer Marky Ramone 
(nee Marc Bell), 37, who joined the band in 1978. "We still have more energy, 
more vitality, than any of these younger guys. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been around for a long time, but we haven't self-destructed, as so many 
bands have done. We don't feel we have to party every night just to prove a 
point. We're party people, but we save our energy for the studio -- and the 
stage." 
</P>
<P>
A clean lifestyle has kept the Ramones, and the rest of the CBGB alumni, young. 
A common mission, a shared sense of purpose, has kept their music relevant, 
Ramone said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the whole CBGB scene began, it was in reaction to where rock 'n' roll was 
going," said Ramone, who at the time played in another pioneering American 
punk-rock band, Richard Hell and the Voidoids. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock was getting too complicated, too fused -- everything was jazz-rock, 
country-rock, progressive-rock, this-rock and that-rock, and it was all so 
bland, so predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"But then bands like us and the Ramones and Blondie came along and stripped 
everything back down to simple, basic rock 'n' roll -- short, sweet, and to the 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Today, 15 years later, rock 'n' roll has once again become "bland and 
predictable," Ramone said. Only this time, he said, the culprits aren't 
passionless fusionists, but passionless heavy-metal bands and techno-pop dance 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"That stuff is whitewashed garbage -- it's what my mother listens to," Ramone 
said. On the one hand, he said, "you've got these really lame, sound-alike, 
heavy-metal bands, like Bon Jovi and Whitesnake. I liked Eddie Van Halen, when 
he first came out, because he was doing something original. But now all those 
other bands are trying to sound like him, like David Lee Roth, like Robert 
Plant, and it's sickening. They've all got the same look, the same makeup; it's 
so boring, already." 
</P>
<P>
And, on the other hand, Ramone added, "you've got these dance bands that, when 
you see them live, everything's on tape. It might not even be them singing, and 
that's the lowest you can go. All those silly looking guys who have this 
gym-toned look about them, thinking it goes over. I get more (mad about) that 
than seeing a fourth-generation Led Zeppelin band." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Ramone's charge that today's rock 'n' roll is "bland and predictable" 
could also be leveled against the Ramones. Over the last 15 years, the Ramones' 
trademark sound hasn't changed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
They're still playing simple, fast songs with deadpan lyrics, no solos, and 
three-chord guitar walls, prompting more than one rock critic to accuse them of 
telling the same joke, over and over and over. 
</P>
<P>
Ramone's response: "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
"The people who criticize us probably listen to disco and Madonna and stuff 
like that," he said. "We've been together for 15 years, and our last album sold 
more than any of our other albums, so we must be doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a unique sound -- straight-ahead, chopped-down rock 'n' roll -- and 
people either like us, or they don't. We haven't changed because we don't want 
to change, and we don't have to change. We're not pressured by our record 
company to have a hit, to sound mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"And, even though we've followed the same formula for such a long time, more 
people are coming to our shows than ever. It's amazing. Our audiences are 
mostly 16- to 22-year-olds, and, although a lot of the older people who have 
been with us from the beginning are there too, it's good to see a whole new 
generation of fans."

ART: ACADEMIC GALLERIES LEND VITALITY AND VARIETY TO SAN DIEGO'S ART SCENE AS 
THEY ASSUME A BROADER ROLE IN STAGING DYNAMIC EXHIBITIONS.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The boom and bust of downtown's gallery scene a few years back spread many a 
grimace across the faces of those San Diegans who crave a regular visual fix. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few galleries still survive downtown, and a few others persist admirably 
in other parts of the city, but not enough to merit calling San Diego a viable 
locale for the sale of art. San Diego may not be a buying audience, but it has 
proven to be an attentive one, eager to feast on the available array of art 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Museums, university galleries, a few alternative spaces and that handful of 
tenacious commercial galleries have all provided a steady diet for the visual 
glutton in town. And another source has emerged in force in recent years: the 
community college gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled in complexes of classrooms, community college galleries have 
traditionally been low-key complements to schools' art departments, featuring 
faculty and student shows as well as other local or regional artists. Perhaps 
in response to San Diego's dearth of adventurous, contemporary art galleries, 
many of the community colleges here have assumed a more dynamic role, 
programming shows of current Soviet art, African-American art and politically 
charged installations. All this in addition to their obligatory fare. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitions are running even higher these days, as three community colleges plan 
new facilities that explicitly aim to serve the community at large, not just 
their student populations. 
</P>
<P>
At Cuyamaca College in El Cajon, for example, funds are being sought to develop 
the new Heritage of the Americas Museum. Based on collections donated by local 
retired businessman Bernard Lueck, the museum will strive to take its viewers 
on a "journey through time." A tour through its four wings will lead from 
Paleozoic fossils, Peruvian burial markers, Iroquois combs, Hopi Kachinas and 
Sioux baby carriers to Western-style painting and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Lueck and his wife, Bernadette, Santee residents who have collected art and 
artifacts for more than 50 years, envision a museum for visitors of all ages 
and are hoping to establish ties with the city school system, according to 
Cuyamaca College President Sam Ciccati. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first museum of its kind in East County," Ciccati said. "For 
us, the benefits are that it ties into our own educational programs in 
anthropology, art and archeology. All of those departments can use the 
materials in the museum as part of their curriculum. Also, it's a wonderful way 
to get members of the community to come to the campus." 
</P>
<P>
Construction for the 10,000-square-foot structure is scheduled to start this 
fall, and the museum will open in the fall of 1991. The Luecks donated $400,000 
toward the museum's construction budget of $900,000, and the college has raised 
an additional $200,000 from corporate and private donors. An endowment will 
have to be raised to support the museum's operations, Ciccati said, although 
the Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District has agreed to help with the 
building's maintenance. The Heritage of the Americas Museum will be the first 
exhibition space for the 12-year-old college. 
</P>
<P>
To the northwest, MiraCosta College in Oceanside trades in its 400-square-foot 
gallery for a new, 1,000-square-foot facility next month, when the college's 
new student center opens Sept. 9. The gallery, on the ground floor of the 
$3-million student center, will be named the Kruglak Gallery, for the late Amy 
Kruglak. In 1985, she made a gift of about $50,000 toward the gallery in honor 
of her late husband. 
</P>
<P>
The new gallery will be better located on campus than the former gallery, which 
was set among the art classrooms. It will therefore be more accessible to the 
community, according to college President H. Deon Holt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to attract more important traveling exhibitions with the new, 
larger space," Holt said, adding that the college board wants the gallery to 
become more of a community resource. 
</P>
<P>
The Kruglak Gallery will open with a MiraCosta faculty show, followed by a show 
of work by Albert Chong, a UC San Diego graduate student who will be a visiting 
scholar at the college for the 1990-91 academic year. Michael Portera, a member 
of MiraCosta's art faculty, will retain the position of gallery director at 
least through December. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mesa College in San Diego continues to search for a major donor for 
its proposed 3,300-square-foot gallery, designed by acclaimed local architect 
Rob Wellington Quigley. Gallery director Kathleen Stoughton will make proposals 
to several potential donors over the next few weeks, in hope of securing a gift 
of $1 million or more to launch the fund-raising campaign. Stoughton estimates 
a budget for the gallery of $2.5 million to $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is that we can't get state funding because of Proposition 
13," she said. "It says that state funds may not be used for the construction 
of art galleries. They're considered frivolous, unless classrooms are included, 
but that poses additional security problems for us." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed gallery features a sculpture concourse, offices and a sunken 
amphitheater. A 1985 gift of 70 works of African art by the family of local 
collector Charles Robertson acted as a catalyst for the planning of the 
gallery. When built, it is expected to provide the only permanent display of 
African art in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa art history professor Barbara Blackmun, a specialist in the area of 
African art, recently attracted another sizable donation to the college, a 
collection of 29 Vigango carved wood commemorative sculptures from Kenya. The 
gift, made by Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Gross of Culver City, has been appraised in 
excess of $95,000. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern College in Chula Vista is also in transition. Larry Urrutia, who 
has held many art-related positions in San Diego, including that of gallery 
director at San Diego State University, becomes the new gallery director at 
Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar College in San Marcos and Grossmont College in El Cajon plan no major 
changes in the coming year, but both have active galleries that, like the 
others, are continually trying to live up to their names by adding vitality and 
variety to San Diego's the art community.

THE MESSAGE OF 'SEALS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Feigen has fought against the stereotypes women are burdened with, she 
has not discovered that men are also the victims of society's most violent 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Does she care that some young men will see "Navy SEALS" and decide that they 
must join so they can prove their worth? Does she care that innocent women and 
children would undoubtedly be killed in an attack such as depicted in "Navy 
SEALS"? No. She only cares that the one white woman in the film is depicted 
well.

To see a film like "Navy SEALS" defended by someone proclaiming to be a radical

OK to maim another human being as long as you're able to spend as much time on 
your hair as Charlie Sheen does?

AN ALTERNATE LOOK AT ACTRESS WHO CLASHED WITH REPORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wonder if other readers found Jan Herman's account of his interview with 
Kelly McGillis as nit-picking and petty as I ("Interview for Garden Grove's 
'Eve' Gets McGillis Irish Up," July 24)? Perhaps I got the distinct impression 
that Mr. Herman's personal animosity got in the way of his ability to conduct a 
good interview for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
First is the excellent, in-depth interview with Miss McGillis which appeared in 
the Washington Post's Sunday supplement last fall. 
</P>
<P>
It portrayed a very different Kelly McGillis. The second reason is based on 
personal observation. I spent eight hours in production with Miss McGillis in 
Washington last October when she agreed to do the introduction and closing 
message of a video to educate women about early detection of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
This reportedly "high-strung" actress was newly pregnant and doing six grueling 
performances weekly at the Folger, yet she cheerfully gave up her day off to 
work for free because she believed in the importance of the message. She never 
complained, never rushed us and treated the entire crew in a professional 
manner, even when we guiltily asked for autographs and a photo at day's end. 
</P>
<P>
One might ask whether the privileges and haughtiness of celebrity extend to 
reporters and critics.

ZINMAN LEADS RUSSIAN PROGRAM AT HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the same way the Los Angeles Philharmonic had renewed its credentials as a 
Ravel orchestra earlier in the week, so did it prove again Thursday night in 
Hollywood Bowl what an expert band it remains in music of Russian composers. 
</P>
<P>
David Zinman, the largely unsung American conductor of wide and deep 
accomplishment, was the instigator of this exemplary demonstration, in a 
program listing Mussorgsky's Prelude to "Khovanshchina," the Second Piano 
Concerto by Rachmaninoff, and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
To all three works Zinman brought a clear sense of structure and line, plus 
intense but never finicky detailing. Our Philharmonic responded with admirable 
soloism, exact balances and a handsome palette of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Tchaikovsky work became at once compelling in its rhetoric and natural in 
its tone of conversation. A strong arch of thought seemed to connect the 
movements, and there was at the end a real sense of resolution. Among many 
others, hornist Jerry Folsom distinguished himself. The Mussorgsky piece, too, 
found the orchestra in fine voice and high mettle. 
</P>
<P>
At midprogram, however, a weak link emerged in this event (heard, it is 
reported, by an audience of 10,761). It was a half-realized, competent and 
unremarkable run-through of Rachmaninoff's familiar C-minor Concerto by Yefim 
Bronfman. 
</P>
<P>
A familiar figure on local stages since his Philharmonic debut in 1977, 
Bronfman this time around did not justify his engagement; he showed no 
compelling personal identification with the composer or the piece, raised no 
musical temperatures and failed to remind us why we love this music. DANIEL

SOVIET BOLSHOI BALLET TO GIVE 7 S.D. SHOWS

<P>
The Soviet Bolshoi Ballet will appear in seven performances at the San Diego 
Civic Theatre from Aug. 21-26. The troupe's weeklong stay is part of the 
company's first American tour since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
While the 56 dancers are here, they will perform recent productions of 
"Giselle" and "Swan Lake," two of the greatest full-length Russian ballets in 
the repertory. 
</P>
<P>
On opening night, Aug. 21, "Swan Lake" will star Nina Ananiashvili as 
Odette/Odile and Alexei Fadeyechev as Prince Siegfried. The performance begins 
at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 22, Nina Semizorova and Yuri Vasyuchenko will appear in the same roles, 
and on Aug. 23, Ludmila Semenyaka and Alexei Fadeyechev will star. All 
performances begin at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Following those three performances, the Bolshoi will present its only 
California staging of "Giselle," in four weekend performances. On Aug. 24 at 8 
p.m., the role of Giselle will be danced by Nina Semizorova, and Alexander 
Vetrov will be Count Albrecht. The performance will be repeated Aug. 25 at 2 
p.m. with Nina Ananiashvili and Alexi Fadeyechev, and at 8 p.m with Alla 
Mikhalchenko and Yuri Vasyuchenko. 
</P>
<P>
Nina Semizorova and Mark Peretokin will play the roles Aug. 26 at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
All performances will be danced to a live orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Seats are available at the Civic Theatre box office, or by calling 236-6510 or 
278-TIXS.

'MEAGER VALUE,' INDEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in regard to the article by Mike Boehm in today's Calendar, Orange 
County edition ("Nigerian Musician Sees Music as a Tool," July 27). He uses 
Voltaire as a cover for his own views condoning the right to allow the youth of 
our nation to be exposed to the worst kind of smut proliferated by the likes of 
Luther Campbell's 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
A quote from the fourth paragraph, "He (Voltaire) would nevertheless defend the 
rappers' right not to be prosecuted for what they have to say, however meager 
its value." Degradation of women and perversion of sex have negative value -- 
much less "meager value"! 
</P>
<P>
I happened to be watching C-Span on July 25 when Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) addressed the House on the exceedingly detrimental effect some 
2 Live Crew rap lyrics have had on the morals of our youth. He could not repeat 
any of the lyrics because of House decorum. However, he read an article on that 
subject by George Will, using substitute medical words. Having heard what had 
been published by 2 Live Crew, I was dumbfounded that so many condone it in the 
name of the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In the interest of decency, such gory smut must be kept from young 
impressionable minds. It seems a way of life for today's youth to the seek the 
"forbidden apple." I applaud the actions being taken in Florida. I appeal to 
our national leaders to follow suit and do what is needed to bolster decency 
and moral values. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of our country and the molders of public opinion have an obligation 
to use their power wisely. "One nation, under God, with freedom and justice for 
all."

IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT DOMINATES NEWS SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public-affairs programs this weekend will be filled with sobering discussions 
of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and what the rest of the world can do about it. 
But some entertaining relief is in store Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh off 14 Emmy nominations, the two-hour pilot of "Twin Peaks," directed by 
David Lynch, repeats Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. If you 
missed it the first time around, now's your chance to see what all the hoopla 
is about. The darkly funny mystery stars Emmy-nominees Kyle MacLachlan, Piper 
Laurie, Sherilyn Fenn and dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't get enough of Madonna when she was in town a few months ago, HBO 
presents "Madonna -- Live! Blond Ambition World Tour '90" at 9 p.m. Sunday. The 
song-and-dance extravaganza, scheduled to be broadcast from Nice, France, marks 
the pop vixen's first in-concert TV performance. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36, 39, Jeff Fahey stars in "Parker Kane," 
a failed pilot about a zany cop who sets up a private-eye business out of a 
Long Beach diner. 
</P>
<P>
And since we all will have to wait at least two more months for a new episode 
of "The Simpsons," Sunday's rerun about daughter Lisa's addiction to the blues, 
8:30 p.m. (11)(6), stands as one of the Emmy-nominated series' most thoughtful 
installments.

KID BEAT: SONG SET AFFIRMS BLACK CULTURAL TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bountiful new entry into the increasingly sophisticated children's music 
market is "Shake It to the One That You Love the Best, Play Songs and Lullabies 
from Black Musical Traditions." 
</P>
<P>
This sleek boxed set with audio cassette and full color songbook, distributed 
by Berkeley-based Lancaster Productions, offers a cornucopia of familiar and 
unfamiliar children's songs, illustrated by two leading black women artists and 
arranged in jazz, reggae, R&amp;B, blues, gospel and classical styles. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at her Northern California home, creator/producer Cheryl Warren Mattox 
said the package was designed to "offer an awareness of black music and art 
from a child's perspective," and to supply a missing component in the 
children's music market: black-oriented product. 
</P>
<P>
"When my son was born, I wanted something for him, part of my tradition," 
Mattox said. 
</P>
<P>
As a musician, and music programmer, producer and host at classical music 
station KQED-FM in San Francisco, Mattox planned "a special radio segment on 
kids' music from the perspective of black traditions," and then found nothing 
available in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox decided to try to fill the void herself. 
</P>
<P>
She began with songs fondly remembered from her own musical childhood -- her 
mother was her first piano teacher and there were 11 children in her family who 
"played musical games under the tree in the front yard." She canvassed friends 
and researched African, Creole and Caribbean songs. 
</P>
<P>
The vividly illustrated songbook contains the place of origin, historical 
context and/or game instructions for each song. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the songs, such as 'Little Sally Walker' and 'Mary Mack,' are familiar 
to many different cultures, (so) some song origins might be questionable," 
Mattox acknowledged. "I included songs known outside the black tradition 
because they have become part of the black community -- part of the tradition 
that parents pass down to their children." 
</P>
<P>
Mattox said her musical arrangements emphasize the diversity of the black 
musical experience. "In 'Little Sally Walker,' for example, I use a jazz 
quartet, keyboards, saxophone, piano and percussion. In 'Jump Shamador,' a West 
Indies song, I use a reggae beat." 
</P>
<P>
She contrasts her classically based arrangements by using "a voice that has a 
more distinctly quote, unquote 'black sound' -- what most people associate with 
an R&amp;B sound." 
</P>
<P>
The vocalists are as diverse as the musical styles. Among them, folk/blues 
veteran Taj Mahal serves up a funky "Hambone" and velvet-voiced Linda Tillery 
sings lullabies, from "All the Pretty Little Horses" to "Ya, Ya, Ya," a lilting 
caress from the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox's appreciation of black art is reflected in the songbook's decorative 
borders -- photographs of African textile patterns -- and in the collage and 
pastel song illustrations, done by contemporary artists Varnette P. Honeywood 
and Brenda Joysmith. Mattox chose the artists, whose works can be seen "The 
Cosby Show" "Amen" and "227," "because they portray black family life and 
children at play in a way that captures the essence of the black experience." 
</P>
<P>
Mattox stresses that, while it is meant to affirm black culture, "Shake It to 
the One that You Love the Best" has no racial barriers. "It is something all 
kids can have fun with," she said. "My hope is that it may stimulate an 
interest in something bigger -- that it will encourage families to enjoy and 
learn about black art and black music."

SOVIET NAVY TROUPE SAILS INTO WARM RECEPTION 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty Soviet sailors will be singing and dancing around town this week. But 
this group won't be doing it just for fun. They're participating in a series of 
tightly orchestrated outdoor public performances in San Diego and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-member Soviet Song and Dance Ensemble of the Pacific Fleet, and the 
Soviet band that accompanies it, sailed into San Diego Tuesday morning, just 
one component in a historic visit by three Soviet navy vessels to this 
once-forbidden territory. 
</P>
<P>
They performed Tuesday night at a private party sponsored by the Chamber of 
Commerce at the U.S. Grant Hotel. And they moved Wednesday to Sea World for a 
noon show. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Soviet ships leave Saturday morning, this vivacious troupe will have 
appeared for one-hour performances Thursday and Friday at the Organ Pavilion in 
Balboa Park. They will also have presented two-hour shows Thursday evening at 
San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre and Friday evening at Tidelands 
Park in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
What is a musical troupe doing in the company of Soviet military on this 
landmark visit to San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
"Music and art are very good for helping us understand each other," said Col. 
Nicholay Bessubchenco, a Soviet public relations officer, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such contacts bring about peace and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Various cultural presentations are typical during official military visits by 
any nation, Cmdr. Cheryl Duft, the U.S. Navy's local liaison for the Soviet 
ensemble, said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the nature of these official visits. When U.S. ships go to 
high-visibility foreign ports, we have bands along doing the same thing. But 
the Soviets traditionally take song-and-dance troupes as well, to give people a 
chance to learn something about their culture," she said 
</P>
<P>
"An exchange of ships is a very big deal," Anatoley Kalekin, leader of the 
Soviet troupe, said through an interpreter. "This is one way to embellish 
that." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good cross-section of ethnic forms, but the company's primary 
charter was to provide entertainment for the troops," Kalekin said. 
</P>
<P>
On those terms -- as pure, hands-across-the-sea entertainment -- the 
song-and-dance troupe succeeds. And, as Adm. Gennadly Alcksandrovich Khvatov, 
commander of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, said laughingly in a pre-show interview, 
the performers show American audiences another side of the Soviets: "We can 
recreate and rest too." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's preview performance at the U.S. Grant was part of a reception for 
local and visiting dignitaries, and the performance was somewhat limited by a 
stage too shallow and cramped to provide a proper showcase for such a large 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Time constraints prevented the group from presenting its full program. Even so, 
the performance was reminiscent of another military-based song-and-dance 
ensemble -- the Red Army Chorus, which brought San Diego audiences out in 
droves last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Army Chorus, which is 200 hundred strong, dished out Russian-style 
razzle-dazzle and bits of Americana in a glitzy, show-biz package. For them, 
Ethnic authenticity was less important than flaunting bravura style and 
fostering international harmony. 
</P>
<P>
The naval equivalent of the Red Army group proved to be similar in spirit, 
though a lot more modest in scale. Tuesday's concert, which lasted 75 minutes, 
ran the gamut from traditional Soviet ethnic songs and dances, to patriotic 
military displays and standard American tunes. The latter clearly had been 
added to the troupe's repertory as a token of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
In full-length performances Thursday and Friday, the Soviets emphasized 
full-bodied dancing and cultural diversity, of which Tuesday night's show gave 
just a sampling. 
</P>
<P>
The show displayed that Soviets are interested in U.S. culture. 
</P>
<P>
The singers performed the troupe's own version of "Home on the Range," "Hello 
Dolly" and "The Man I Love." And, like the Red Army, this troupe also had the 
crowd in rapture with a rousing chorus of "God Bless America," before bounding 
into a busy finale that packed the stage with costumed performers. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful piece on Tuesday's program was a contemporary, comic dance 
routine satirizing military life. Both the Soviets and their American hosts 
were quick to see the humor of brow-beaten sailors swabbing the decks and doing 
other necessary but unrewarding housekeeping chores. 
</P>
<P>
A phalanx of male dancers stopped the show in its tracks when they came on -- 
in perfect unison -- imitating a set of gears in a well-oiled machine. Only 
this machine kept bogging down, just when the frustrated mechanic thought he 
had solved the problem to get it running in high gear. 
</P>
<P>
Of the few pure ethnic dances on the program, the flashy show of martial arts 
and sword play done by men wielding wicked-looking lances and sabers was the 
most thrilling and kinetically satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cramped space, a band of agile men flung themselves into 
mock-combat, then followed with a series squatting kicks, tumbles, spread-eagle 
jumps and other traditional Cossack-style maneuvers to wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Six women are included in the dance ensemble. They never got a chance to shine 
on Tuesday's program, although they kept popping up in different costumes, from 
ancient ethnic wear to chic sailor suits. The singers and musicians, some 
playing ancient instruments, fared better. They were given several 
opportunities to shine, and they had the audience clapping along merrily to 
their lusty seaman songs more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the rafter-raising reception the Soviets got from this audience of 
about 600, San Diegans are right in tune with the Soviet military's brand of 
entertainment. And the enthusiastic Soviet song-and-dance troupe was obviously 
just as happy to be performing their first concert here. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the concert, the singers intoned warmly to their audience: 
"Dear Friends, let us be just good friends."

SEN. DEDDEH, NATIVE OF IRAQ, URGES CAUTION IN DEALINGS WITH HUSSEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita), who was born and raised in Baghdad and 
remains in close contact with officials in Iraq, on Friday urged Americans to 
reserve judgment on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"If we portray him as (another) Kadafi, as I heard (a federal official) 
describe him, we are doing a disservice not just to him but to us," said 
Deddeh, who immigrated to the United States in 1947. "Contrary to what 
politicians have been saying, he's not crazy, he's not a madman . . . he knows 
exactly what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh, who does not know Hussein personally, has met with most members of the 
controversial leader's cabinet and with most of Iraq's recent U.S. ambassadors. 
Deddeh met with some of those officials during a 1987 Baghdad visit, his 
seventh return trip since leaving Iraq in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh described Hussein as an "authoritarian" who has managed to retain the 
loyalty of his countrymen. "The proof of the pudding is that Iraqis love him," 
Deddeh said, despite the staggering loss of life that Iraq suffered during its 
decade-long war with Iran. "He has the support of probably 99% of the people," 
Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh, who ardently opposes Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, "supports everything 
that (President Bush) has done so far" in the form of sanctions. But he 
maintained that there is "no reason to spill American blood over Kuwait unless 
there is an interruption of the flow of oil" out of the region. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy "has been, is and will continue to be that we will not tolerate 
a disruption of the flow of oil from that area," Deddeh said. "The question we 
have to ask as Americans is if Saddam Hussein is going to stop the flow of oil 
-- and the answer to that is no." 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh maintained that Hussein is not interested in disrupting oil exports 
because Iraq is desperate for the hard currency oil production generates. But 
Deddeh said Hussein probably will try to force recalcitrant members of the 
oil-producing cartel to obey quotas that were designed to raise the price of 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh linked the surprise invasion to a longstanding territorial dispute over 
a part of Kuwait known as Rumiala. The territorial dispute has existed for 
centuries and was exacerbated at the close of World War I when Western powers 
arbitrarily carved up the region, a process that turned Kuwait into a separate 
country, Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that history, Americans should not seek a quick or simple 
explanation for the invasion, Deddeh said. "Even when I was child in elementary 
school in Baghdad 50 years ago, we kids used to have demonstrations about how 
this was (Iraqi) territory," Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries have tried to negotiate a settlement to the 
territorial dispute, the disagreement led to armed confrontation in part 
because oil-rich Kuwait, which accounts for 10% of the world's known oil 
reserves, was demanding that Iraq repay billions of dollars in loans made 
during the war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Kuwait's "legitimate" demand for debt repayment occurred as Iraq 
"came out of its 8 1/2-year war with Iran . . . economically disadvantaged, 
having lost (much) of its hard currency," Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which lost as many as 300,000 soldiers and an estimated $100 billion 
during the war, "rightly or wrongly" accused Kuwait of stealing oil from the 
Rumiala province's rich fields, Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh expressed "surprise" at the unexpected invasion. But he said that Iraqi 
observers suspected that military action might occur following a 
"little-noticed communique" the two countries issued just days before the war 
broke out. 
</P>
<P>
The communique indicated that Iraq and Kuwait had broken off negotiations over 
the territorial dispute "after just a half hour or so," Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, knowing the history, that something would happen," Deddeh said. 
"But I did not think that Iraq would move into Kuwait the way that it did." 
</P>
<P>
But Deddeh maintained there is "absolutely no cause, no reason for (Iraq) to 
have any hostile relationship with Saudi Arabia . . . they're not traditional 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, Deddeh said, seems more intent upon stabilizing the price of oil and 
forcing the Middle East's petroleum-rich countries to stick with production 
quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq claims that, every time the price of oil drops $1, it costs them $1 
billion," Deddeh said. "So, if you reduce the price of oil from $19 to $14 or 
$15, you've cost them $5 billion," Deddeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein also is signaling his intent to turn Iraq into the "defender of any 
Arab land . . . between the Atlantic and the Persian Gulf," Deddeh said. "But 
people should not get emotional about that," Deddeh said, because Hussein "does 
not want to attack anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein "is not a paper tiger," Deddeh said. "I've read his speeches, and what 
he's saying is, 'If you hurt me, I'll hurt you.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to God that the experts in Washington, D.C., know that he means 
business," Deddeh said. "He has 1 million soldiers who are fully armed and 
battle-tested." 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh is a member of San Diego's Chaldean community, a group of 1,300 Roman 
Catholic families who immigrated to the United States from Iraq. Deddeh, who 
moved to Detroit in 1947, came to San Diego in 1959.

PROBE OF BOY'S BORDER DEATH NEARS END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office is nearing the conclusion of 
its "intensive" investigation into the much-publicized killing almost 10 weeks 
ago of a 12-year-old Mexican boy who was shot shortly after he illegally 
crossed the border into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Luis M. Aragon, the deputy district attorney who has been handling the 
sensitive case, said this week that he expects the inquiry to last another week 
or two before authorities decide whether to file criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have succeeded in narrowing the scope of our investigation, so I'm 
optimistic that we will be able to conclude" the inquiry, Aragon said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy district attorney declined to provide further details about the 
investigation or to say whether he expected criminal charges to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
However, investigators are believed to have reduced the number of possible 
suspects in the case to two, including Leonard Paul Cuen, a 21-year-old U.S. 
citizen who was initially arrested in connection with the shooting but later 
released because of a lack of evidence. Cuen remains a suspect, Aragon said. 
The identity of the other possible suspect could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying, which occurred on May 18, attracted considerable attention on both 
sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. A few days after the killing, the Mexican 
Foreign Ministry issued a statement alleging a "racist current" in California 
and urged U.S. authorities to thoroughly investigate this and other possible 
cases of abuse against Mexican citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The motive behind the slaying, however, remains unknown. San Diego police have 
indicated that Cuen may have been target-shooting in the area when a bullet 
went astray and killed the boy accidentally. Authorities have said publicly 
that there is no evidence that the killing was motivated by racial animosity. 
Cuen and his friends have no known links to organized hate groups, authorities 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
A principal difficulty in cracking the case, authorities say, has been 
pinpointing who -- of as many as four people -- fired the shot that struck 
Emilio Eusebio Jimenez Bejines in the skull, killing him instantly as he stood 
on a rugged border hillside. The boy, accompanied by his uncle and two 
siblings, was en route to his parents' home in the Orange County community of 
Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Cuen, an apprentice plumber, lives in a home on San Diego's Monument Road, 
about a half-mile north of the international border. The property is directly 
in the path of a major illicit crossing route that is followed daily by dozens 
of undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the killing, authorities have said, intermittent shooting 
emanated from the rear balcony of the Cuen home from about 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 
p.m. The boy was shot at about 3:20 p.m. There is an unobstructed line of fire 
from the Cuen property to the site where the boy was killed, which is about 350 
yards to the south of the Cuen dwelling, authorities have said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuen was arrested the day of the killing but was freed 11 days later after 
officials announced that there was insufficient evidence to file homicide 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is in possession of a .30-caliber hunting rifle 
believed to have been the weapon that killed the boy. The rifle allegedly 
belonged to Cuen. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, Cuen was rearrested and booked in connection with the 
bow-and-arrow robberies in March of two groups of undocumented immigrants. 
Those allegations were separate from the case involving the dead 12-year-old 
boy, although information about the robberies emerged during the slaying 
inquiry, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuen is free on $45,000 bail in connection with the robbery cases, which are 
still under investigation, the district attorney's office said.

SOVIETS TAKE A FINAL TASTE OF AMERICANA; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: ON THEIR LAST FULL DAY IN SAN DIEGO, SOVIET SAILORS TOOK IN THE 
RODEO, TALKED TO BOY SCOUTS AND WENT SHOPPING AT MIRAMAR. 
</P>

<P>
Enjoying their last day in San Diego, Soviet sailors got a full dose of 
Americana Friday, bartering with Boy Scouts and U.S. Marines while watching a 
rodeo at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors, who leave for their home port of Vladivostok this morning, spent 
their last full day here watching the show, trading parts of their uniforms and 
taking pictures with U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, they saw a flight demonstration at Miramar Naval Air 
Station and shopped at the commissary. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, in the United States as the third in a series of reciprocal 
U.S.-U.S.S.R. naval visits, said they were surprised how quickly the week went 
by and had just begun to understand how much there is to see in California. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Kokolov, a seaman on the destroyer Boyevoy, said through an interpreter 
that he had seen a rodeo on television in Moscow, but he didn't entirely 
understand what the point was. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand it's a sport," said Kokolov, 20. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest differences between Americans and his countrymen, he said, 
was that "the people here are so talkative." 
</P>
<P>
Americans will chat about anything, he said. He also found them unreservedly 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who drove by on the road waved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While wild horses kicked and pawed inside their pens, a U.S. Marine Corps honor 
guard paraded to the center of the rodeo grounds, hoisting the Soviet and U.S. 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
Servicemen from both countries saluted while each national anthem was played. 
In the stands, the all-white uniforms of the visitors were interspersed with 
the camouflage fatigues of their hosts. 
</P>
<P>
But many, rather than watching, hung around the fringes of the arena, 
exchanging gifts with the Marines and a group of Boy Scouts who had been 
invited to attend the closed event. 
</P>
<P>
What Americans wanted more than any other item was a T-shirt signed by one of 
the Soviet sailors; finding someone to explain what they had written was even 
tougher. Some wrote that they looked forward to seeing the sailors who plan to 
visit Vladivostok; others simply signed their names. 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviets found themselves puzzled by more than the meaning of rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans' frequent use of hand motions was a cause of many Soviet 
inquiries to the interpreters, said one, Gunnery Sgt. Kris Hankinson. 
</P>
<P>
On base, many were perplexed by the Marines' use of the hand signal that means 
"I have a phone call for you" -- -- the thumb and pinky extended and the three 
other fingers curled to the palm. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, it is customary for three people to share a bottle of 
vodka, said Hankinson, and there, that same "phone call" motion means "I want 
to drink vodka and I need two others to join me." 
</P>
<P>
"They were wondering what was going on with all these officers," Hankinson 
said. "They were beginning to think they were all out looking to find people to 
drink vodka with." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his evaluation of San Diego food and San Diego women, Yevgeniy 
Finko, 21, said, "The food was good, and so was everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Finko, a seaman on the Boyevoy from the city of Frunze in the Soviet state of 
Kirghiz, added that his opinions and attitudes about the United States formed 
while growing up in the Soviet Union had been discarded during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much been a total turnaround," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, when asked what they liked the most about their visit, the Soviets 
said they had liked many things and had not had enough chance to see them 
fully. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too little time," said Zgena Fomenko, 20, a seaman on the destroyer 
Admiral Vinogradov who hails from a small village on the Volga River. "We 
didn't have enough time to see all that there is to enjoy."

MORE CITY JOB SEEKERS TO FACE DRUG SCREENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an expansion of San Diego's drug-testing program, applicants for more than 
half of the 9,000-plus city government jobs -- particularly those involving 
operating hazardous equipment or driving city vehicles -- will be screened for 
illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Under action taken Thursday by the city's Civil Service Commission, the city's 
drug-screening program, which now covers about 3,000 employees in 30 job 
classifications, will be expanded to 165 job categories occupied by more than 
4,500 workers, according to Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which already applies to employees such as police officers, 
firefighters, trash collectors and lifeguards, will be expanded to cover dozens 
of other jobs ranging from groundskeepers, roofers and divers to airport 
workers, building inspectors and parking enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
Employees affected by the change are those who work in jobs that require them 
to drive while on city business, operate hazardous equipment, provide support 
work for public safety activities, handle controlled substances or work near 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded drug-screening is designed to minimize dangers to the public and 
other city workers posed by employees performing hazardous jobs while under the 
influence of illegal drugs, city administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our principal objective is to get a drug-free workplace," McGrory said. "One 
of the best ways to accomplish that is to screen out anyone with a drug problem 
before he becomes part of the work force." 
</P>
<P>
Applicants whose tests reveal any illegal drugs in their blood or urine will be 
automatically rejected, McGrory explained. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Civil Service Commission has considered also applying the new 
rules to current city workers, existing employees will not be subject to the 
widened testing program pending negotiations between city administrators and 
labor unions over the next month.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
A La Mesa woman who pleaded guilty to child abandonment during a shoplifting 
incident at a department store was sentenced Friday to 120 days in jail and 
five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Della Youngblood, 20, was sentenced by Municipal Judge Allan J. Preckel for 
deserting her children with the intent to abandon them and for petty theft with 
a prior theft conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"She endangered her children and further endangered the security guard who went 
after her," Preckel said. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood left her 2-year-old twin daughters in front of the J. C. Penney 
store in the Fashion Valley shopping center while store detectives were 
pursuing her June 19. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood fled in a car, eluding the guards. She was arrested the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood, who also has a son and is pregnant, was called "immature" by her 
attorney, Mary Jo Barr. Barr said the three children are in the care of their 
paternal grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood was sentenced under a plea bargain with prosecutors. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Robert W. Sickels asked the court for probation, saying he wanted to see 
the family reunited.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handicapped Escondido woman who was harassed by her apartment manager and the 
building owners over her aid dog received a $60,000 award and a guarantee of 
reasonable housing accommodations under a consent order signed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Delores D. Roberts, a resident of the Quail Creek Apartments in the 1800 block 
of North Broadway in Escondido, is the recipient of the award. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development filed charges last 
February against Gladys Purkett, the manager; W. W. Quail Creek Partners Ltd., 
the owner, and W. Wolf Industries, the general partner. HUD alleged that they 
had discriminated against Roberts by attempting to evict her because of her aid 
dog; had interfered with her use of the dog; had charged her a "pet deposit" to 
keep the dog in her apartment and had harassed her about the dog.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUND BARRIER TO BLOCK LAX NOISE TO BE 
STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo will study the feasibility of installing a sound barrier along 
Imperial Highway to reduce the noise from Los Angeles International Airport, 
which has plagued the city for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airport Commissioners last week allocated $50,000, but no date for 
the start of the study has been set, said Don Harrison, assistant to the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The terrain along Imperial is hilly, and Harrison said the city believes that 
an earthen berm or a wall could effectively shield homes in lower-lying 
neighborhoods from the engine noise of aircraft on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Beard, LAX airport noise abatement officer, said a 20-foot-high berm and 
wall combination built several years ago north of the airport has cut noise 
from planes operating on the ground by up to 50% for the first two rows of 
homes near the wall.

Yukiko (Yuki) Anami, who owned and operated the Tropico Nursery in Glendale for 
50 years, has died at her La Canada Flintridge home. She was 69. 
</P>

She died Monday of cancer, said her daughter, Maureen Ujimori. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Anami was raised in Glendale and graduated from Hoover High School in 
1938. She worked in the Tropico Nursery, owned by her father, until 1942 when 
her family was forced to sell the property and live in the Manzanar War 
Relocation Center in eastern California. On Sept. 27, 1943, a police escort 
took her and Isei Anami to Reno, where they were married. She continued to live 
in the camp while he fought in Europe with the Army's 442nd Army Regimental 
Combat Team, a Japanese-American unit. 
</P>

After the war, the couple found the nursery on San Fernando Road abandoned and 
repurchased the property. They built a successful nursery, closing it when they 
retired in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Anami is survived by her husband of 46 years; a son, Kenneth Anami of 
Arcadia; daughters, Christine Anami of Pasadena and Maureen Ujimori of North

KIDNAP ORDEAL ENDS IN L.A. FOR OREGON MAN, 77; 
</P>
<P>
ABDUCTION: THREE TEEN-AGERS ASKED HIM FOR A LIFT. POLICE SAY THEY THEN ROBBED 
HIM AND TOOK HIM FOR A LONG RIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They looked like nice, clean-cut kids, George Howard Russell would say later. 
So when they asked him for a lift, the 77-year-old man figured, why not? 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a bizarre alleged kidnaping that started Tuesday afternoon in a King 
City, Ore., shopping center and ended early Friday in Los Angeles. Three 
Portland, Ore., teen-agers -- a 17-year-old youth and two 14-year-old girls -- 
were arrested after Russell managed to tell a nurse at White Memorial Hospital 
that he really wasn't their grandfather, as one had claimed -- he was their 
hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, physically unharmed in the ordeal, told authorities that he was forced 
at knifepoint on a journey that, financed by his credit cards, ventured to 
Phoenix, San Diego and Tijuana before circling back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It ended after one of the girls developed abdominal pains, prompting a visit to 
the emergency room. After hospital personnel at White Memorial refused to treat 
her without her parents' consent, the girl said her grandfather was outside in 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about her," Russell told nurse Eloy DeJesus, according 
to a police report. "I'm a kidnap victim!" 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested the three teen-agers and by noon Russell, whom a 
friend said normally leads "a very regimented" life, was on an airliner bound 
for Portland. Russell's family and friends had grown worried about his 
whereabouts Wednesday and had reported him missing Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Pat Detloff of Oregon's Clackamas County Sheriff's Department said it is 
likely that the teen-agers will be returned to Oregon to face charges. They 
were being held in the meantime at a downtown Los Angeles juvenile hall. 
Officials said one option was to drop charges in California and return the 
three to Oregon, so that they can be charged and tried there. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged kidnapers' identities were not released because of their ages. 
Detloff described the two girls as "wards of the court" who had apparently run 
away from foster homes or a juvenile detention center. 
</P>
<P>
Police were trying to determine the boy's status. "He may be a ward of the 
court, too," Detloff said. 
</P>
<P>
The three teen-agers apparently are not related, and it was not clear how they 
met up with each other. 
</P>
<P>
At least initially, however, the three posed as siblings in their encounter 
with Russell. According to police reports and an account that Russell provided 
to White Hospital officials, the abduction began about 2 p.m. Tuesday when the 
two girls approached Russell at a shopping center in King City, a small 
retirement community about 10 miles south of Portland. They asked him for a 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, they were joined by the boy, whom the girls identified as their 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they looked clean-cut, so he decided to give them a ride," said Mark 
Newmyer, a spokesman at White Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the four then headed toward Wilsonville, Ore., a town of about 
5,000. Then, Russell told hospital officials, the boy pulled a knife and began 
shouting at him. He was ordered into the back seat and the boy took the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
They meandered around Wilsonville, apparently trying to disorient Russell, said 
Officer Sharyn Michelson, a Los Angeles police spokeswoman. She said that at 
one point they stopped the car and, after robbing Russell of $50, were 
preparing to let him go. But they abruptly changed plans, apparently figuring 
it would be useful to have Russell handy to sign for credit card purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided to keep him with them for purposes of credit card purchases for 
gas, food, et cetera," Michelson said. "They told him if they were to get 
stopped, he would state that he's their grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
They arrived in Los Angeles on Thursday and stopped at White Memorial Hospital 
about 11 p.m. Emergency room personnel told the girl they could not treat her 
without her parents' consent. 
</P>
<P>
The girl returned to the emergency room about 3:30 a.m. Friday, explaining that 
her grandfather was asleep outside in their car. Newmyer said nurse Eloy 
DeJesus, increasingly suspicious, then approached Russell. 
</P>
<P>
When Russell told the nurse he had been kidnaped, "the kids told Eloy that 
their grandfather didn't know what he's talking about . . . that he's like that 
sometimes," Newmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
When hospital staff members called police, it was confirmed that Russell had 
been reported missing in Oregon. Hospital security detained the teen-agers 
until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Russell's son flew in from Oregon to meet his father, place 
him on a flight home and retrieve the car. In telephone interviews, Russell's 
family and friends, waiting at his King City home, expressed relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my heavens, yes, we're relieved," said a family friend, who requested 
anonymity. "George is a very regimented man and, for someone to deviate from a 
routine, we were very worried."

AIR AMBULANCE PLAN IS SHOT DOWN BY OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief advocate of a 24-hour air ambulance service in the Hollywood Hills, 
disappointed and discouraged by reaction to his $3.4-million proposal, is 
expected to recommend next week that the Los Angeles City Fire Department 
abandon the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"If you try to help somebody, and they poke you in the nose for it, you stop 
and say, 'Hey, I am on your side,' " Deputy Chief Donald Anthony, who heads the 
department's Fire Suppression and Rescue Bureau, said in an interview. "We are 
getting beat up, so to speak, for trying to improve the level of care of 
citizens between the scene of the incident and the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they proposed the service -- which would include purchase 
of a $2.6-million medical helicopter -- to provide better care for victims of 
violent crimes and car accidents in metropolitan Los Angeles. The department 
currently responds to trauma calls with firefighting aircraft based at Van Nuys 
Airport, which limits most responses to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the responsibility to provide the best level of service that we can to 
the entire city, not just a single area," Anthony said at a hearing Monday on a 
department request to operate from Mt. Lee, above the Hollywood sign. "We see 
it as a centralized location." 
</P>
<P>
Although county health officials have not formally reviewed the proposal, they 
have said that they fear a centralized helicopter service would overburden an 
already beleaguered trauma-care system by flooding member hospitals with 
faraway patients. 
</P>
<P>
"A decision involving transporting trauma patients affects the whole system," 
said Barbara Pavey, head of operations and monitoring for the county 
trauma-care agency. "Our view has to be broad and global. We can't look at it 
narrowly." 
</P>
<P>
Some Hollywood Hills homeowners also applauded Anthony's decision. 
</P>

"If they want to get closer to these serious traumas that require high-speed 
action, they should look at where they are occurring," said Chuck Welch, head 
of the Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn. helicopter committee. "They are not 
occurring on Mt. Lee. It is in the South-Central area where they are stabbing 
and shooting people every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, who had shepherded the air ambulance proposal through a variety of 
approvals over the last seven months, said he informed Fire Chief Donald O. 
Manning of his decision shortly after the hearing on Monday. The hearing was 
dominated by critics of the proposal, including homeowners and county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony said Manning made no decision on his recommendation, but asked for a 
written report. Manning was out of town Friday and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents who support the proposal expressed disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should stick to their guns," said Andrew Ettinger, chairman of 
the Lake Hollywood Homeowners Assn. safety committee. "Anything we can do to 
live in a safer and more secure world is a good idea."

MISTRIAL IS SOUGHT IN CAMARENA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: JURY MISCONDUCT IS ALLEGED BY A LAWYER FOR BUSINESSMAN CONVICTED OF 
CONSPIRACY IN DRUG AGENT'S DEATH. HE SAYS JURORS DISCUSSED NEWSPAPER ARTICLE.

<P>
Alleging jury misconduct, lawyers for a wealthy Mexican businessman convicted 
earlier this week of conspiring to kidnap and murder U.S. drug agent Enrique 
Camarena asked a federal court judge in Los Angeles Friday to declare a 
mistrial in his case. 
</P>
<P>
The motion, filed on behalf of defendant Ruben Zuno Arce, contends that jurors 
in the politically sensitive trial discussed among themselves information about 
the case that was not placed in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno's attorneys specifically argue that juror William Parris admitted to U.S. 
District Judge Edward Rafeedie in a closed hearing Thursday that jurors 
"discussed at length" a July 27 article in The Times about the conviction of 
another defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie, after a brief hearing Friday afternoon, said that he would not hold a 
hearing on the motion until the jurors have concluded deliberations on the 
final defendant in the case, Javier Vasquez Velasco. The jury is scheduled to 
resume deliberations Monday, having earlier returned guilty verdicts against 
three other men. 
</P>
<P>
The Times article, which ran on the front page of the July 27 edition, reported 
that jurors had convicted Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros on three charges, 
including conspiracy, stemming from Camarena's 1985 abduction and slaying. The 
jury, however, acquitted Matta of murder. 
</P>
<P>
The article also reported comments of Matta's defense lawyer, Martin R. Stolar, 
that the verdicts were "inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Rafeedie ordered the lawyers in the case not to make any further 
comments until the jurors concluded deliberations on all defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno's lawyer, Edward M. Medvene, said in a declaration filed Friday that he 
had been informed the night before that juror Parris told the judge that the 
jury discussed the Times article on Matta's conviction at some length "because 
it indicated that their decision was inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
The motion further asserted that "it is clear that any consideration by the 
jurors of information outside of the record and not in evidence is improper and 
may well have affected their deliberations and/or verdict" regarding Zuno, who 
was convicted three days after Matta. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene's declaration objects to the fact that Zuno's lawyers were not asked to 
attend the hearing Rafeedie convened in his chambers Thursday afternoon, 
contending they were entitled to be there because jurors had discussed matters 
that may have affected their deliberations regarding Zuno. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Rafeedie told Medvene in court that he had not summoned him to 
Thursday's hearing because it was his understanding that the incident which 
precipitated the hearing had occurred Wednesday, one day after Zuno was 
convicted. The judge also said that a transcript of the hearing was being 
prepared and would be made available to defense lawyers as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene's motion did not disclose the source of his information, other than to 
say in his declaration that it was not obtained from court staff. Rafeedie 
questioned him on the source of the information and said he would have to 
present stronger evidence than he had thus far. 
</P>
<P>
A brief shouting match ensued during which Medvene said it had been 
"outrageous" for the judge to hold Thursday's hearing without asking Zuno's 
lawyers to participate. Rafeedie retorted: "Don't tell me what took place. You 
weren't there. Tone your comments down. You're getting out of control." 
</P>
<P>
The judge told Medvene that after talking to the jurors he decided that there 
had been no impropriety in regard to the deliberations on Vasquez. The judge 
also said "the jury appears to be working exceptionally hard . . . 
painstakingly going over the evidence in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie also said that he found it "ironic" that a defense lawyer in the case 
was raising a claim that a defendant's rights might have been injured by 
publicity because prosecutors have not been commenting about the trial and a 
defense lawyer had. He then gave Stolar a tongue-lashing for holding frequent 
press conferences during the trial and for his extensive comments after his 
client was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Stolar said he had followed the judge's order about issuing comments to the 
news media. "I have not stepped over the line," Stolar declared. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene's motion also stated that he had been informed that "certain (U.S.) 
marshals" who escort the jurors entered and exited the jury room "on a regular 
basis and that one of the marshals asked one or more of the jurors on one or 
more occasion when they were going to come back with (a) verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Zuno's lawyers asked the judge to declare a mistrial or hold a hearing at which 
they could question the jurors about any newspaper articles they had discussed 
or any communications they may have had with federal officials, including 
marshals. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Zuno's lawyers asked that a judge other than Rafeedie conduct the 
hearing in order to avoid any possible appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno, the brother-in-law of former Mexican president Luis Echeverria Alvarez, 
was convicted Tuesday of the same three charges as Matta. The counts included 
committing a violent act in aid of a racketeering enterprise, conspiring to 
kidnap a federal agent and aiding and abetting the kidnaping of a federal agent 
because he was performing his duties. 
</P>
<P>
The mistrial motion was filed by Zuno's lawyers on the 15th day of jury 
deliberationsin the high-profile trial stemming from the February, 1985, 
abduction and murder of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Camarena in 
Guadalajara, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, Rafeedie called each of the jurors into his chambers and 
interviewed them for a total of 40 minutes in the presence of federal 
prosecutors and Vasquez's lawyer. After the interviews, jurors resumed 
deliberations and all the lawyers said the judge had ordered them not to speak 
to the press about what had been discussed in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of deliberations Thursday and Friday, the jury was summoned into 
open court by Rafeedie and he repeated to them warnings that he had made 
several times earlier that they are not to read any newspaper stories or watch 
any television news about the case.

FOSTER MOTHER SURRENDERS CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: RESEDA WOMAN HAD ACCUSED COUNTY OF A WITCH HUNT. THE 
YOUNGSTERS WERE REMOVED BECAUSE OFFICIALS HAVE REOPENED A CLOSED, 3-YEAR-OLD 
SEX ABUSE ALLEGATION AGAINST HER HUSBAND.

Kathie Durand hugged 4-year-old Dillon and cried. The boy's royal blue trunk, 
stuffed with clothes, a toy car and some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cookies, 
was on the living room floor. The social workers were at the door. They had 
come to take Durand's foster children away. 
</P>
<P>
"I love you," Durand told Dillon, who was the first to go. "I love you very 
much and you know, we're going to go into court and try . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Her voice trailed off. It was no use trying to explain the intricacies of the 
county's foster-care system to a 4-year-old. All he knew was that he was 
leaving home, going for a car ride with a pleasant woman in a red car who gave 
him a grape candy and assured a tearful Durand that the child could call her 
from his new foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Thus marked the end of Durand's unsuccessful effort to prevent authorities at 
the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services from removing the four 
children from her Reseda home because of an investigation into a 3-year-old 
allegation of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Durand accuses the county of engaging in a witch hunt, offering as proof a 
therapist's report that said the child's complaint, which was against Durand's 
husband, Eric, was "less than believable." County officials said Friday that 
they have substantiated the allegation -- made by a former foster daughter -- 
and are moving to revoke Durand's license. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Durand's battle with the county began when she was tipped off this week that 
the youngsters still in her home would be taken. She hid at a friend's house 
(she maintains she was "visiting"), met with a lawyer and went to court seeking 
a temporary restraining order against the county. 
</P>
<P>
The legal maneuver came as county officials, acting on orders from the state 
Department of Social Services, are reopening more than 650 old investigations 
into allegations of sexual and physical abuse in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
The parents had been cleared in every case -- including the Durand matter -- 
that the county is investigating again. So far, the county has removed 25 
children from 11 foster homes, not including Durand's. 
</P>
<P>
Durand was apparently the first foster mother to go to court in an attempt to 
keep her foster children. But after two days of unsuccessful efforts to get a 
judge to hear the issue, her lawyer advised her she could not make a case. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, as county officials prepared to seek a warrant for her 
arrest, Durand -- exhausted emotionally and physically -- called the Department 
of Children's Services and volunteered to hand the youngsters over. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Everett," she said to Everett Harper, chief of the department's 
investigative unit, "I'm going to try not to cry." 
</P>
<P>
As vice president of the San Fernando Valley Foster Parent Assn., Durand has 
known Harper for years. After their phone call, she said he had assured her 
that he would support her. 
</P>
<P>
But in a subsequent interview, Harper said that although he thinks she is a 
good foster mother, the county will press for revocation of the Durands' 
license. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just she as the foster mother," Harper said. "We have to consider 
them as a home . . . I really do sincerely hope that we get clear evidence that 
nothing happened and it's a safe home for kids. But that's not what the 
evidence is today." 
</P>
<P>
So at 4 p.m., after she had called each child's social worker, Durand took the 
children back home. All the youngsters are troubled in some way. Vincent, 13, 
is a former gang member who said he quit at Durand's insistence. Lakasha, 9, is 
considered medically fragile, as is Dillon, the 4-year-old. Terry, 6, is 
emotionally unstable and given to inflicting harm on herself. All but Dillon 
have lived with the Durands for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
As they prepared to leave, Vincent packed for his foster siblings, putting 
their toys and clothes in garbage bags. Durand gave him four cards with her 
phone number; he handed them to each child. The teen-ager put a fresh shirt on 
Dillon, the boy he considers his little brother, remarking that he dresses 
Dillon each morning. When Eric Durand called, the younger children demanded to 
speak to "Daddy." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent wondered aloud what would happen to him. "I think I might be able to 
come home," he said hopefully. "Don't you think this is a safe foster home?" 
</P>
<P>
At 5:15, the social workers began arriving, apologetic but firm. Dillon and 
Lakasha were sent off to different foster homes; Terry and Vincent went to 
MacLaren Children's Center, the county's emergency shelter for children. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time in what seemed like ages, Kathie Durand, foster mother, 
was alone.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN-AGER KILLED, 2ND HURT IN GANG SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-ager was shot to death and another was critically wounded Friday in a 
gang-related shooting in the middle of a Hollywood intersection, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the dead and injured teens were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Detective James Leahy said the shootings occurred about 7:30 a.m. after two 
gang members surprised a pair of rival gang members in the middle of the 
intersection of Gower Street and Fountain Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
One of the gang members fired on the other two in an attack witnessed by about 
20 people, Leahy said. Police arrested two suspects in the assault, a 
15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old youth. Their names were not released because 
of their ages.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRASH HAULERS SLAPPED WITH 22 NEW CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The husband-wife owners of a trash-hauling company who ignored four years' 
worth of citations for serious mechanical defects on their fleet of garbage 
trucks have been charged with 22 additional misdemeanors, prosecutors said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Banuelos, 61, and his wife, Elsie Banuelos, 58, the owners of AB Rubbish 
Disposal Services in West Los Angeles, were charged June 15 by the city 
attorney's office with six misdemeanor violations. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, the couple was charged with 22 additional misdemeanors stemming 
from inspections conducted at the company by the California Highway Patrol July 
22 and July 25. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical problems found during the inspections included defective brakes, 
steering and exhaust systems and inoperable headlights, turn signals, 
windshield wipers and back-up alarms, said Deputy City Atty. Don Cocek. If 
convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to a year in County Jail and fined 
$1,000 for each charge.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 INDICTED IN DRUG MONEY LAUNDERING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury has indicted four men from the Los Angeles area and an 
Argentine on charges that they laundered about $96 million in illicit drug 
money through the downtown jewelry district and local banks as part of an 
international conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, released by the U.S. attorney's office Friday, comes on the 
heels of arrests made two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Indicted were George Atik, Harout Beshlian and Jean J. Mahroukian of Los 
Angeles, Sarkis Tanijian of Northridge and Celio Merkin, an Argentine living in 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. U.S. Atty. Mark J. Werksman said that the government decided against

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDERER SEIZED AFTER 3 YEARS AS FUGITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted murderer Kenneth (Kendog) Evans, a South- Central street gang member 
who escaped from Los Angeles County Central Jail more than three years ago, was 
returned this week from Atlanta, where he was arrested for breaking into a car. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old fugitive escaped on Feb. 5, 1987, by switching identification 
wrist bands with a fellow prisoner who was ready for release. 
</P>
<P>
When the man's name was called, Evans stepped forward and walked out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Evans was awaiting sentencing for the 1985 slaying of a gang rival 
shot in a drive-by attack. Evans was brought back to Los Angeles on Thursday by 
members of the sheriff's fugitive detail and placed in a jail section reserved 
for high-security risks.

SOCKERS HAND TOTH A NET LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zoltan Toth, a five-time MISL All-Star and two-time Goalie of the Year, has 
been told by the Sockers that he will not be re-signed for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
Toth's agent, Scott Simpson, said Friday he received a call from Socker Coach 
Ron Newman on Wednesday and was told the Sockers could not afford to pay Toth's 
salary after signing Victor Nogueira, the team's other goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Toth made $68,000 last season and became a free agent at the conclusion of the 
playoffs. Simpson said Socker President Ron Cady told him several weeks ago 
that the Sockers would sign Toth for $50,000 but has not had any contact with 
him since. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just awfully upset at the way they handled this," Simpson said. "He has 
given them six good years." 
</P>
<P>
Said Toth: "I don't think I deserve that kind of treatment. I think I did 
something for the Sockers, if you look at how successful we were." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Newman nor Cady could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
At 34, Toth is still marketable coming off a season in which he played a number 
of superb games during the playoffs. He said he will consider offers from other 
teams but will take into account the welfare of his family. Toth's 1-year-old 
son, Christopher, underwent heart surgery shortly after birth, and Toth said he 
wants him to be able to stay in San Diego where he can remain under the 
supervision of his current doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Toth, a 10-year veteran who played his first four seasons for the New York 
Arrows, said St. Louis and Tacoma have expressed interest in signing him. 
Simpson said he has received an offer of $50,000 from one team in the league. 
Toth said he plans to make every effort to stay in the game for at least two 
more years. 
</P>
<P>
"I live for soccer and all my heart is in soccer," Toth said. "The World Cup is 
here in 1994. I want to hang in and do the best for the sport." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers appear to be digging themselves into a bit of a hole with their 
inability to re-sign key veterans. Along with Toth, defenders Ralph Black and 
George Fernandez have departed to other teams, and sources say defender Cacho 
was told this week he won't be re-signed for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the salary cap reduction from $770,000 to $630,000 makes it 
difficult for a team coming off its third consecutive championship to pay 
players and reward them for their accomplishments. Yet questions are being 
raised as to why the players aren't being kept up to date on their status. 
</P>
<P>
"There has got to be a better system for players to know if they're wanted," 
captain Brian Quinn said. "We haven't had a lot of communication. We absolutely 
didn't know what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the salary cap, Quinn thinks the Sockers will fill their 
thin areas by the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned at the moment," he said, "but I think there are still going to 
be good players available. If everyone adheres to the salary cap, no one is 
going to be able to afford all the players they want."

PADRES UP TO THEIR SECOND-HALF TRICKS

<P>
Yeah, the Padres know what you're thinking 
</P>
<P>
They hear the snide remarks by their peers. They sense the exasperation of 
their fans. They read what the critics are saying. 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, the Padres are playing great baseball. It must be that time of year again, 
right? Win lots of games . . . come close to winning the division . . . fall 
short . . . and be picked by everyone in the world to win the National League 
West the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
Hello, deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Padres again. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres continued to terrorize the division Friday night by knocking off the 
Cincinnati Reds, 3-2, and leaving 34,773 at Riverfront Stadium wondering where 
this team has been for the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
The team that brought you a dramatic finish in 1989 -- winning 27 of their last 
36 games -- and the team that went 67-48 in the final five months of 1988 to 
achieve respectability, is at it again. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who were 21 games out of first place just 10 days ago after losing 
29 of 37 games, suddenly are looking look like the team of their spring 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
They have won nine of their past 12 games, talking all of a sudden as if they 
want to be part of this pennant race, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably about a month too late for the Padres. They still are in fourth 
place, 14 games behind the Reds, and no team in history has recovered from such 
a deficit this late in a season and won a division or pennant. 
</P>
<P>
But who says you can't dream? 
</P>
<P>
"The game of baseball's so screwy," Padre first baseman Jack Clark said, "who's 
to say we can't come back. No one expected this, did they?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Padres have materialized as the Reds' greatest nightmare, defeating 
them for the fifth time in the past six games. The Reds' 11-game lead over the 
rest of the division has shrunk to just 4 1/2 games, their smallest margin 
since May 3. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who has more homers and RBIs the past month than any player in the 
National League, sent the Reds to their fifth consecutive one-run defeat with 
his heroics in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 2-2, with one out in the ninth when Tony Gwynn hit a one-out 
single to center off reliever Rob Dibble. Clark followed by ripping a ball down 
the third-base line past Chris Sabo into the left-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hatcher ran over to cut the ball off, but as he abruptly stopped, he 
tumbled into the outfield, allowing Gwynn to run home while Clark reached 
second. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only run the Padres would need. Once Greg Harris (6-5) hit leadoff 
hitter Billy Hatcher in the ninth, Padre Manager Greg Riddoch summoned Craig 
Lefferts. A botched bunt and a double play later, the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters flooded into the Reds clubhouse asking ever so bluntly if they're 
choking. 
</P>
<P>
Reds Manager Lou Piniella refused to answer, saying only, "I'm tired of making 
excuses for these guys. Someone should tell them how (bad) they are." 
</P>
<P>
And then they poured into the visitors' clubhouse wondering if the Padres are 
capable of winning only when there's no pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, understandably more amiable, said: "I sit in my room hours at a time 
to reflect on that. I have my own feelings about it, but it's not a time to 
share it. Maybe when the season's over." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, however, who seemingly would be offended at such an accusation, 
actually said there might be something to this custom. 
</P>
<P>
Can they win under pressure, when the pennant race still is wide-open? 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't earlier in the year," Padre starter Bruce Hurst said, "so I guess in 
1990 the answer is no. It's not to say it won't be different in 1991, though." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "It could be true. I don't know. It sure seems that way, though, 
doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, if nothing else makes sense this year, the Padres have shown a 
strong tendency to follow the lead of Clark. He's been the main man during this 
run, batting .358 the past 24 games with nine homers and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will not publicly reveal their personnel plans for 1991, but it's 
become quite evident that Clark is here to stay. And the way Clark was talking 
Friday night, he'd like most of his teammates to return with him. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, there needs to be some changes made. The Padres want to find a center 
fielder, a shortstop, a third baseman, a reliever or two and a starter. 
</P>
<P>
But wholesale changes? 
</P>
<P>
Clark vows it would be a huge mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this team is the type of team you rip apart because we don't win 
first place," Clark said. "If you do, there'll be a setback. This team needs to 
stay basically intact. It's obvious a few changes need to be made here and 
there, but I'd like to see this team given a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'm capable of doing, and I'm capable of putting up some good 
numbers. But I think what you have now is more of a balance. The (Joe) 
Carter-Clark thing is happening more now than it was before. The double-threat 
that was supposed to be there is finally starting to materialize." 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, so are those dreams . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I have some thoughts about some miracle comeback," Riddoch 
said, "but the way we're playing right now is like the way I knew we could 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"But we sure went through an ugly mess there, didn't we?" 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst, who has turned around his season over the past three starts, says 
the difference can be attributed to Nolan Ryan. He was watching Ryan compete 
for his 300th victory in Texas when he noticed his high leg kick. He then 
examined a recent photo of himself that ran in the newspaper, and saw that his 
leg kick was not nearly as high. "It all came back to me," Hurst said, "and I 
started to put it in use." The result? Hurst allowed just six hits and two runs 
(one earned) in eight innings Friday. He has allowed just three earned runs in 
his past 24 innings. "I can thank Nolan for this," Hurst said. . . . The only 
real mistake Hurst made the entire night was a 0-2 changeup that he threw to 
Chris Sabo in the eighth. Sabo homered. Besides costing him a run, it also will 
cost him a fine in the Padres' kangaroo court. "I know I should waste a pitch 
there," Hurst said, "but I'm not going to do it just to save myself 10 bucks." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive game that Sabo has homered. He's the first Reds 
player to accomplish the feat since Nick Esasky in July, 1987. Catcher Johnny 
Bench owns the club record with seven homers in five days on May 30-June 3, 
1972. . . . Sabo has 21 homers for the season, the most by a Reds third baseman 
since Tony Perez hit 25 in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Eric Show, who's still bothered by tendinitis in his right wrist, 
was scratched from his scheduled start Sunday against the Reds. Instead, Calvin 
Schiraldi will make his second start of the season. Show was supposed to pitch 
on the side Friday before the game, but the pain in his wrist prevented him 
from pitching. "I don't know what the problem is. It's getting a little better, 
but I think I need just a couple of extra day's rest. I'll be all right." Show 
is expected to start again Tuesday in the doubleheader against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Greg Riddoch had a private meeting with third baseman Eddie 
Williams about his mental lapses in Thursday's game, and is contemplating 
benching him. "We'll just see what happens," Riddoch said. "I don't know what 
I'll do right now." . . . Reds first baseman Todd Benzinger on the standing 
ovation the team received Thursday night upon returning from its 3-8 trip: "I 
was confused, I thought Roseanne Barr had walked out to sing the national 
anthem." . . . Reds infielder Ron Oester, describing the reaction by his family 
when they saw he shaved his head during last week's trip to California: "My son 
loved it; he couldn't stop touching it. My one daughter didn't want to talk 
about it. My other daughter said, 'He's still our daddy.' My wife didn't want 
to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Ed Whitson cleaned up on the team's bass fishing expedition 
Friday morning, snaring 20 of the group's 40 bass. Also joining Whitson in the 
fun were Riddoch, pitchers Derek Lilliquist and Craig Lefferts and outfielder 
Tony Gwynn. . . . New York Yankee scout Fred Goodman is in Cincinnati to scout 
the Padres. The Padres earlier this season expressed interest in relievers Eric 
Plunk and Greg Cadaret. . . . Just when it appears the Reds are primed for a 
big-league collapse in the N.L. West, starting pitcher Danny Jackson is 
expected to soon rejoin the rotation. Jackson, who went on the disabled list 
July 17 and was expected to be out the remainder of the season with a rotator 
cuff injury, instead was out throwing at full strength before Thursday's game. 
As it turns out, Jackson said, it wasn't a rotator cuff injury after all. It 
was just torn scar tissue. "I felt no pain whatsoever, absolutely zero," he 
said. "To me, this is the best my arm has felt. Everybody thought it was 
rotator cuff, but it was, I wouldn't be able to pitch like I did today. The way 
I feel right now, there's no reason I can't get back on the mound. Jackson is 
expected to begin a rehabilitation assignment in triple-A Nashville on Sunday, 
and after making two starts, is scheduled to return to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch on perhaps saving the career of Dodger pitcher Jay Howell: "When I was 
managing in Eugene, I got a call one night from the wildlife conservation 
officer. He told me he had Scott Brown and Jay Howell in custody. It turns out 
they were fishing in an area where salmon spawning. There was a sign, no 
fishing. They caught three fish, and one died, so he said it would cost $100. I 
said, 'Don't worry, you'll get your money, and I'll discipline them. But 
please, don't arrest them.' In those days, if you get arrested, you get cut, 
too. Even today, Jay Howell will tell me, 'You know, Ridd, I'll never forget 
what you did for me. You got me over the hump.' "

<P>
San Diego County will be going for its fourth consecutive victory tonight 
against other just-graduated high school players in the Southern California 
College Prep All-Star Football game at Mira Mesa High School. 
</P>
<P>
The game matches 40 of the best local players against a team mostly made up of 
players from the Los Angeles City Section. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers allowed Los Angeles to draw from Southern Section teams within the 
city's boundary to make the game more equitable. 
</P>
<P>
Among local players scheduled to participate are Point Loma quarterback Danny 
White and his favorite receiver, teammate Brett Callan. 
</P>
<P>
White was the county's leading passer, completing 144 of 239 attempts for 2,522 
yards and 21 touchdowns last year. He averaged 252.2 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
Callan was the county's leading receiver with 59 receptions and a 17.5 
yards-per-catch average. 
</P>
<P>
White will go to Penn State, Callan to California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the others competing for San Diego are Oceanside running back Terry 
Vaughn (Arizona), who led the county with 166.2 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's offense will be coached by Ramona's Mel Galli; Southwest's Carl 
Parrick coaches the defense. They will be joined by Point Loma's Bill Settles 
and Lincoln's Roy Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $6 for adults, $4 for students with ID and 
$2 for children under 12. MARTIN HENDERSON

GO GRANNY'S GO: TRIALS OF A DESERT COURSE CAN'T STOP WINNING FOURSOME

BORREGO SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a 44-mile bike race here Friday, and no one dropped of heat stroke or 
dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
The finishing times, however, were slow, as 70-kilometer team time trials go. 
Especially considering that this was the Junior National championships. 
</P>
<P>
Granny's Gourmet Muffins (Matt Johnson, Seattle; Eric Harris, Boulder, Colo.; 
Eric Kaiter, Boston; and Greg Strock, Boulder) took first with a time of 
1:32:55.77. 
</P>
<P>
In second place with a time of 1:36:36.14 was SVAA/LeMond (Chris Giedt, Morgan 
Hill; Ozzie Hutchins, Fremont; Colby Pearce, Boulder; and Jon Vaughters, 
Englewood, Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
It takes a 1:26:30 to qualify for the Junior World championships. 
</P>
<P>
There were reasons for the relatively slow times. Surprisingly, the searing 
heat was not No. 1 on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it got hot out on the course -- after all, Borrego Springs is at the foot 
of the Southern California Desert. But it was really nothing, cyclers said, 
compared to the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the flat course of cyclists' dreams. Fast times were just a 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone said there were a couple hills," said Pearce of SVAA/LeMond. "But it 
was more like a mountain pass." 
</P>
<P>
SVAA/LeMond was the fifth foursome to hit the course (in a time trial, teams 
are started at two-minute intervals), but was first to cross the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, partial results were posted after nine teams came in, and SVAA/LeMond 
seemed to have first-place wrapped up with a 40-second advantage over the 
second-place team at the time, the Spirits of St. Louis B squad (Matt Gates, 
Burlington, Iowa; Jessie Ray, Columbus, Ohio; Andy Wall, Marion, Iowa; and 
Chris Yenkey, Salina, Kan.), which crossed at 1:37:16.28. 
</P>
<P>
Well, guess who crossed 10th, after starting in the 17th slot and passing six 
teams? 
</P>
<P>
Team Granny's, which consisted of four riders who had not before competed as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
And although communication and team work is of the essence in team time trials, 
Team Granny's members insisted their victory was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of us have done a lot of time trials," said Kaiter, the No. 3 rider. "So 
we felt it would be pretty easy to get into a groove."

DRAGSTER SNAKEBITTEN THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE FLEISCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Don (The Snake) Prudhomme, the second-winningest drag racer of all time 
and one of the legends of the sport, was told that he was in 12th place in the 
current NHRA Top Fuel standings, he was taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I that high? I'm doing better than I thought," Prudhomme said by telephone 
from Seattle, where he is getting ready to compete in the National Hot Rod 
Assn. Northwestnationals. 
</P>
<P>
After a record-breaking, 16-year career as a Funny Car driver, Prudhomme 
decided to move up to the Top Fuel class this season, the level at which he 
competed from 1965-73. So far this year, not much has gone right for him in the 
rear-engine machines. 
</P>
<P>
He has crashed three times -- in Montreal he demolished his car -- and has 
advanced to the semifinals just once, in the Springnationals in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"This year has been nothing to be proud of so far," said Prudhomme, 49, who 
lives in Granada Hills. "I just got to keep lugging away. . . . All you can do 
is keep going straight ahead. There's no other solution. If there was, I'd be 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
With 40 NHRA wins -- 35 in Funny Cars -- Prudhomme, a four-time Funny Car 
champion from 1975-78, is second to only Bob Glidden (76) on the all-time win 
list. His last Top Fuel win, however, came in 1970 against Jim Nicoll in the U. 
S. Nationals in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The lone bright note in Prudhomme's season so far is that he has the fastest 
speed in the world (289.23 m.p.h.), set at the Springnationals. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the three crashes this season it is ironic that Prudhomme returned 
to Top Fuel this year because of safety reasons. In addition to the Montreal 
crash June 23, Prudhomme crashed in Dallas in March and Bakersfield in December 
in the car in which he is now forced to compete. 
</P>
<P>
"You might laugh at that, but I wanted to get the engine behind me. So far it's 
been like jumping out of the pit into the fire," Prudhomme said. "Top Fuel is 
also the quickest car in the sport and I wanted to be part of it for that 
reason. When we went 289, that's the fastest I've ever gone. . . . You can just 
let it all hang and go for the records." 
</P>
<P>
Prudhomme describes the Montreal crash as "the accident that caught my 
attention more than any other in my career." About 300 feet off the line, the 
front end of his car became airborne and a 20-mile head wind caused the 
Swindahl racing car to do a back flip. The car rolled over the guard rail into 
a dirt area. Prudhomme, amazingly, walked out under his own power, with the 
engine still running. The car was broken into pieces and beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a few weeks to get that out of my mind. It's not something you can 
forget right away. I was waking up in the middle of the night for a while," 
Prudhomme said. 
</P>
<P>
Prudhomme attributes the trouble to the clutch mechanism on his car, which he 
describes as the "brains of the car." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd just be able to take the engine and the clutch out of our Funny 
Car and put it in a Top Fuel car and win. It's not that easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this year's woes, Prudhomme has no regrets about the switch to Top Fuel 
and feels confident about the rest of the year. Last month, Prudhomme visited 
Saugus Speedway and was mobbed by fans and friends in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I miss is the winning," he said. "In my Funny Car career, I've 
been in situations like this before, where all of a sudden things turn around 
and I win an event or two. I can still go out to Saugus Speedway and the fans 
aren't booing. They're coming up and wanting to talk racing or get your 
autograph. That's one of the things that still makes you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Closing the gap: Although he has yet to win an event this season, M. K. Kanke 
of Granada Hills is in a tight race with Doug George for the points lead on the 
NASCAR Southwest Tour. 
</P>
<P>
With his third-place finish in the Olympia 100 in Eureka last week, Kanke cut 
George's lead to 40 points after 10 of the 18 scheduled races on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Driving a Pontiac, Kanke started in the fifth position and finished behind 
winner Troy Beebe of Modesto and Randy Olson of Eureka. George, who entered the 
race leading by 55 points, finished sixth and now leads Kanke, 1,493 to 1,453. 
</P>
<P>
Kanke, picked before the season by fellow drivers and officials as a 
co-favorite to win the tour championship, now has five top-five finishes, 
including one second-place finish. Kanke, who finished third in the standings 
last year, is second in earnings with $10,505, trailing George ($18,826). 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale, who finished fourth in Eureka after starting 
ninth, is third with 1,420 points, and Ray Hooper Jr. of Palmdale is fifth with 
1,355 after an 11th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Other Valley-area drivers in the points standings include Bob Lyon of Newhall 
(eighth with 1,185), Dennis Dyer of Palmdale (ninth with 1,166), Mark Perry of 
Saugus (10th with 1,055) and rookie-of-the-year candidate Wally Pettengill Jr. 
of Sepulveda (15th with 732). 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Tour continues Aug. 11 with the Spears Manufacturing 100 at 
Stockton Speedway.

COUNTY FAIR TO MIX FOOD BOOTHS, SHOWS, LONG TRADITION AND TALKING EGG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sight of a 6-foot, 3-inch talking egg may be one of the weirder spectacles 
at an event more noted for its nonverbal farm products. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Ventura County Fair opens this month, Mr. Egg, a skateboarding 
spokes-product for the California Egg Commission, will "charm visitors while 
talking with them about the nutritional value of eggs," fair promoters trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
The fair, which began 115 years ago as a showcase for blue-ribbon farm animals 
and produce, is trying to keep up with the times while still offering some 
old-fashioned flavor with the theme, "A Timeless Tradition." 
</P>
<P>
With 30,000 entries and displays, there are enough traditional and unusual 
items to keep fair-goers happy during the 12-day run from Aug. 15 to 26, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
There will be 60 food booths, 300 vendors, rock and country music concerts, and 
of course, eggs, only one of which speaks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fair is a traditional fair. People enter their 4-H animals and canned 
goods," said Earl McPhail, Ventura County agricultural commissioner and a fair 
director. "The fair in the last three years has done a lot better job in trying 
to display Ventura County agriculture."

<P>
Last year, the fair drew more than 306,000 people, up about 9% from the 
previous year, Assistant Fair Manager Art Amelio said. 
</P>
<P>
The fairgrounds on Harbor Boulevard in Ventura are now almost completely empty, 
but come mid-August, fair officials expect more than 25,500 people to pass 
through the turnstiles daily. The fairgrounds will be open from 11 a.m. to 
midnight daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorgeous weather could produce some nice attendance figures," Amelio said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of an expected increase in fair attendance, more than $2.3 million in 
sales are projected this year, up from last year's $2 million, Amelio said. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing fair attendance has helped make Ventura County's annual event one of 
the 10 largest county fairs in the state, McPhail said. But it has not always 
been a moneymaker. Last year the fair lost about $500,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
General admission is $5 for adults and $2 for children 6 to 12 and senior 
citizens. Children age 5 and younger are free. 
</P>
<P>
Helped by the usual restrictions on alcoholic beverages and weapons at the 
entrance, fair officials expect a smooth event, although parking may be a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
There are only 2,000 three-dollar parking spaces available. Free shuttle buses 
will run from lots at Ventura High School, the County Government Center and the 
Buenaventura Plaza Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
One pre-fair highlight will be Sunday, when the Ventura County Fair Queen is 
chosen from among eight contestants at the Agriculture Building. 
</P>
<P>
A fair parade, led by Grand Marshal and Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), 
will follow on Aug. 18 down Ventura's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fair's livestock and agricultural entries, there will be 
live nightly entertainment with 75 shows. The Smothers Brothers kick off the 
first day with a performance in the grandstand area. Other entertainers include 
the Pointer Sisters on Aug. 16 and Johnny Cash on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will also feature a bit of the bizarre. Besides meeting Mr. Egg, 
fair-goers can toss around cow chips, pick the ugliest fish and, for men, 
compare mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the turnstiles open, workers will be trucking in materials to 
prepare buildings at the 62-acre fairgrounds for displays featuring products 
and student crafts produced in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Construction for some horticultural displays began last week, said Barbara 
Schneider, superintendent of the floriculture department. Schneider's job is to 
turn a 30,000-square-foot building into an outdoor garden. 
</P>
<P>
Workers on Friday were digging holes and building gardens at the Floriculture 
Building. Many of the elaborate garden displays will sit on 4,000 square feet 
of grass surrounded by about 60 tons of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, who has handled the floriculture displays for more than 21 years, 
said workers have put in 12- to 14-hour days readying the building for an 
estimated 3,000 floral and garden entries. By the time the fair starts, 
Schneider is exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to do without sleep," she said. "I love to see it come together. 
I've done it for a long time, and I never fail to get excited." 
</P>
<P>
Judging of some of the student contests will take place in the next two weeks 
before the fair opens. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the nearly 2,000 children who enter the fair each year were at the 
grounds Friday entering their arts and crafts for various contests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest thing of the year. My grandsons look forward to this all 
year," said Joan Meyer, assistant superintendent for the youth department. 
</P>
<P>
High school classes from around the county are gearing up for a 
locker-decorating contest next week. "They get really wild, I'll tell you," 
Meyer said.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: ANACAPA ISLAND;

BRICK LIGHT STATION IS INCLUDED ON NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES

<P>
The Anacapa Island Light Station was included Friday in the National Register 
of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
The brick lighthouse stands 276 feet above the water at the easternmost point 
of Anacapa Island. 
</P>
<P>
The island, which has a land mass of only about one square mile, is 14 miles 
south of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a number of maritime disasters, an unattended beacon was installed 
on the island in 1912, followed by construction of the lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.S. Coast Guard lived on Anacapa and staffed the lighthouse 
until it was made fully automatic in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The former Coast Guard buildings now house a National Park complex. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Coast Guard Station on Channel Islands travel to the lighthouse 
once a month to check on the still-functioning light, foghorn, radio beacon and 
generator. MAJA RADEVICH

TRAFFIC RESEARCH CENTER OPENS

<P>
A research facility where trainees will be taught to untangle traffic problems 
has been opened at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Growing counties, including Ventura County, will soon be beset with such 
typical urban problems as traffic congestion, said Steve Hockaday, director of 
the $500,000 traffic research program devised by the California Department of 
Transportation, California Highway Patrol and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The research facility simulates the Los Angeles Traffic Operations Center, a 
control tower in which workers gather information from the roadways and then 
direct police, tow trucks and emergency vehicles to clear up traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
"Caltrans and the CHP will be building a number of centers like the one in L.A. 
throughout the state," Hockaday said. "This research facility will be used as a 
training ground and as a way to test out new techniques." 
</P>
<P>
A computer wall display will show a representation of roadway conditions, 
traffic flow, simulated accidents, rush-hour traffic jams and other problems. 
Trainees will phone in instructions, providing realistic practice in dealing 
with traffic jams, Hockaday said. MAJA RADEVICH

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;

<P>
CITY MAY EXPAND NO-SMOKING BAN

<P>
The Santa Paula City Council is scheduled to consider an ordinance Monday that 
would restrict smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
The city has had a no-smoking policy in government buildings since 1987, and 
the council is being asked to consider broadening that policy to other public 
places such as restaurants, theaters and health-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a lot of guts for the council to pass such a measure," 
Mayor Kay Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The council has to be sensitive to the needs of the business owners and their 
ability to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Compliance with the regulation could be a problem for small businesses such as 
mom-and-pop cafes, she said, where segregating smokers from nonsmokers would be 
difficult because of size limitations. 
</P>
<P>
However, a survey of other cities in the county has shown few problems with 
similar ordinances, City Clerk Stacey MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first 60 days, during which people expressed concerns, there have 
been no problems reported," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A first violation would earn a fine of $100 or less. A second infraction would 
cost $200. 
</P>
<P>
A third instance of noncompliance would be considered a misdemeanor and would 
cost the business owner $1,000. AMELIA CHAFFEE

MAN WHO PASSED OUT WHILE BURGLARIZING HOME GETS 1 YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Salvadoran national, who authorities say passed out in a drunken 
stupor while burglarizing the residence of an elderly couple, has been 
sentenced to one year in jail, court officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
William Spencer Castro pleaded guilty to one count of felony burglary in the 
March 26 break-in at the Van Nuys residence of Betty Bernds, 83, and her 
husband, Edward, 84. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Bernds arose from bed about 2 a.m. to help her husband and stepped on 
Castro, who was lying unconscious on the floor, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Castro admitted to authorities that he drank 20 beers before breaking into the 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Castro was carrying a seven-inch kitchen knife and had taken money and jewelry 
before passing out on the bedroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
He was still asleep when police arrived, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the one-year jail term, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Leon S. 
Kaplan sentenced Castro to five years probation and one year of house arrest 
and ordered him to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings five days a week for an 
indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver had asked Kaplan to sentence Castro to a state 
prison term.

"It is unlikely that someone raised in a South-Central Los Angeles housing 
project would have this privilege," said Firpo W. Carr of Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
But Carr, 35, on leave from his customer service post with IBM, departed this 
week for a second visit to a Leningrad library to photographically record 
selected pages of documents important in studies of religious texts. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is the Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library, where a team from 
USC and the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center in Claremont two months ago 
photographed all 1,000 pages of the Leningrad Codex, the oldest complete 
manuscript of the Hebrew Bible. Negotiations to photograph that codex and other 
works in the vast collection, which have been rarely accessible to Western 
scholars, were begun years ago by the Claremont center. 
</P>
<P>
Carr was able to get first crack at the codex in early 1989 after striking up a 
friendship with the library's manuscript section director, Viktor Lebedev. The 
American photographed 20 pages of the document, but the purposes and procedures 
differ from the Claremont-USC project. 
</P>
<P>
Carr is using an IBM system called Audio/Visual Connection, which holds promise 
for instructional and research uses. 
</P>
<P>
Karie Masterson, a programmer/analyst with the UCLA Humanities Computing 
Facility, has been working with Carr. "We will take the videotape he gets, 
connect a television and VCR to a computer, then grab frames of the pages from 
the television and save them on hard disks," she said. The photographed images 
then can be viewed on a computer screen along with transliterations and 
translations of the same page to aid students and scholars. Because the images 
are put into computerized form, they could be transmitted over phone lines to 
other study centers as well. 
</P>
<P>
Masterson said that among the manuscripts being filmed by Carr for UCLA is a 
partial copy of the Egyptian Book of the Dead held by the Leningrad library. 
</P>
<P>
In his six days at the library, Carr will also be photographing a 
1,074-year-old partial manuscript of the Hebrew Bible and filling various 
scholarly requests, such as recording documents on church councils for medieval 
specialists at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
With studies in ancient languages and a doctorate in computer science from 
Pacific Western University, Carr established his ScholarTechnological Institute 
of Research in Hawthorne in hopes of introducing both scholars and lay people 
to techniques in the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE

The Rev. Robert B. Watson, a United Methodist pastor in Montrose who as a 
7-year-old played "Pee Wee" in the 1938 movie "Boys Town," recently gave the

Town, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
The sometimes audacious preacher of prosperity, the Rev. Ike, minister of New 
York City's 5,000-seat United Church since the 1960s, will speak on that theme

ROBINSON: NO SLATER TRADE SET; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: RAMS' CAPTAIN IS STAYING OUT OF TRAINING CAMP IN ATTEMPT TO FORCE 
CONTRACT RENEGOTIATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ram tackle Jackie Slater, who is in the 10th day of his holdout in an effort to 
get his contract renegotiated, reportedly has asked the Rams to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year veteran, who is a six-time Pro Bowl selection and a team captain, 
was scheduled to make a reported $550,000 this season. He is being fined the 
NFL maximum of $1,500 a day for failing to report. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had conversations, but if he's demanded to be traded, he's demanded it 
to someone else," Coach John Robinson said, responding to an article in the 
Orange County Register that quoted Slater as saying he had asked Ram management 
to trade him last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie has a dispute and it's in the best interests of everyone if we work it 
out," Robinson said. "And that's all I have to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
Slater, 36, ranks fifth on the Rams' all-time list for games played and has 
said he wants to play two more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, who acts as his own agent, could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams practiced at UC Irvine Friday morning and then finished packing for 
today's flight to Berlin, where they will play an exhibition game against the 
Kansas City Chiefs next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the workout marked the end of the "brutal phase" of training camp 
and indicated that he was pleased with the team's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the time when we like to take the team as close to the edge of 
exhaustion and collapse as you can, and I think we've done that," Robinson 
said. "I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Neal Allen, Damone Johnson's agent, said that the Rams don't seem to be in a 
hurry to sign the veteran tight end. "They made their offer last Thursday and 
we haven't talked since," Allen said. "I assume we'll resume negotiations after 
the Berlin trip. We'll get it done, it's just a matter of time." It could be a 
long time. The Rams offered a two-year deal worth $575,000. Allen says Johnson 
wants $1.1 million for two years.

MELVIN DURSLAG: WHO WILL REACH 1,000 IN 1990 RAM BACKFIELD?

<P>
The arrival in the Tonga islands of the copra boat, bearing mail, supplies and 
surprises from the outside world, is an occasion sparking excitement among the 
villagers. 
</P>
<P>
They wonder eagerly what new and heart-swelling treasures the vessel calling at 
their port will bring that day. 
</P>
<P>
Those who follow the Los Angeles Rams think in such terms, asking, with a 
tingle of fire, what halfback will the boat unload this year to run 1,000 yards 
or more? 
</P>
<P>
Unfailingly, someone runs for 1,000 yards or more for the Rams -- Eric 
Dickerson, Charlie White, Greg Bell. Tucked into the inventory this time are 
Cleveland Gary, Curt Warner, Gaston Green. Whoever among the three is selected 
to run with the football is bound to gain the standard Ram yardage, because the 
system is set up to facilitate it. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you work up such a foam over the running game?" a visitor inquires of 
John Robinson, field commander of the force that calls itself Los Angeles while 
dwelling not even in the same county. 
</P>
<P>
Parenthetically, it can be noted here that Genoa salami doesn't always come 
from Genoa, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Running is the single most important element in the game," Robinson explains. 
"However you care to break down football, it is a street fight. And the running 
game is the basic method for inflicting your will on the other guy. You are 
delivering, in effect, body blows that will wear him down physically, leading 
to wearing him down mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Robinson doesn't minimize the forward pass, considering the skill of 
the man he commissioned to throw, Jim Everett, and the speed of those who 
receive, Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"But passing can be good some days and not so good others," Robinson says. 
"Running is still your most consistent way to advance the ball. It is 
uncomplicated. We don't see ourselves as scientists." 
</P>
<P>
Enlisted to run for the Rams, Dickerson fled to Indianapolis. White entered dry 
dock. And Bell arranged a trade to the Raiders, explaining that the Rams 
offered love, but little money. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders offered Marcus Allen to the Rams for a certain defensive performer, 
but the Rams passed. Whether they passed because they didn't want to give up 
the defensive player or didn't want to pay Allen the $1.1 million his contract 
demands isn't known. 
</P>
<P>
But not famous for lavish spending, the Rams are a marvel of football, winning 
with players complaining chronically that they are on bread and water. 
</P>
<P>
Since Robinson has nothing to do with the payroll, but must turn out omelets 
with the eggs he gets, one would have to decorate him for landing in the 
playoffs six of the seven years he has served the club. 
</P>
<P>
Now embarked on a new season with a troupe that leaves today for Berlin to 
engage Kansas City next Saturday, Robinson is eager to look at those 
auditioning for the No. 1 post as Ram running back this year. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the contenders, Green and Gary, are first-round picks of earlier drafts. 
Warner, 29, is recycled, having logged seven years at Seattle while sustaining 
his share of wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever the principal runner is going to be, Ram supporters are assuming he 
will follow the line of succession, knocking off his 1,000 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
OK, they are explaining their ground game to fans in Berlin, who listen 
respectfully, pointing out that the system was set up for the Wehrmacht to move 
on the ground, too, whether it was under Von Moltke, Von Rundstedt, or Rommel. 
</P>
<P>
As you possibly know, the Ram exhibition will be played at Olympic Stadium in 
Berlin, built for the Games of 1936, at which Jesse Owens won four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
It often has been reported that Jesse earned his four golds in the presence of 
a lip-biting Adolf Hitler, which is only partly true. 
</P>
<P>
Hitler bit his lips but wasn't there to do it for all of Owens' events. On 
certain days, Adolf would appear in what was called the "loge of honor" but 
leave early, no doubt to beat the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
It would follow, a half-century later, that Laker fans would emulate the 
chancellor, who hasn't been seen around Berlin for a long time, but maybe will 
call, asking for two on the 50 to the Ram game. 
</P>
<P>
Like most people asking for two on the 50, he will say, "Look, I want to pay 
for 'em."

Florence Arthaud, a 33-year-old Frenchwoman, set a record for a solo sailboat 
crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by nearly two days. 
</P>
<P>
Arthaud arrived at Lizard Point in southwestern Britain in the pre-dawn hours 
after a voyage of 9 days 21 hours 42 minutes, said Louis Bodin, a friend of 
Arthaud's who helped guide her across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Arthaud set out from New York July 24 aboard the 60-foot trimaran Pierre 
Premier. The previous record of 11 days 11 hours and 47 minutes was set by 
Bruno Peyron of France aboard a catamaran in 1987.

George Steinbrenner's lawyers said a letter sent to 18 limited partners wasn't 
an attempt by the New York Yankee owner to defy commissioner Fay Vincent and 
maintain control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman and Steinbrenner's tax lawyer, Daniel McCarthy, responded to a New York 
Daily News report of a letter McCarthy sent to the Yankees' limited partners 
this week after Vincent barred Steinbrenner from running the club. 
</P>
<P>
The letter asked the limited partners to allow Steinbrenner to remain involved 
in "all financial, tax and other business purposes" of the Yankees even after 
he gives up majority interest in the team later this month. Kaufman and 
McCarthy said the letter was designed to smooth the transition when 
Steinbrenner moves from general to limited partner.

SHEIK IS EULOGIZED BY IOC

<P>
Sheik Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, who was killed during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, 
was remembered Friday as a progressive and ambitious leader in international 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
Fahd had been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1981, 
president of the Olympic Council of Asia and a vice president of both the 
international soccer and team handball federations. 
</P>
<P>
According to an IOC statement, Fahd was killed Thursday while defending the 
Dasman Palace of his brother, Kuwait ruler Jabbar Al Ahmed al Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic movement has thus lost a highly valued personality whose 
contribution to Olympicism and sport in Kuwait, Asia and the world was 
especially fruitful," the IOC said. 
</P>
<P>
Anita DeFrantz, an IOC member from Los Angeles, said Fahd was active in a 
movement to encourage more Asian women to participate in sports. 
</P>
<P>
She said intermediate hurdler Nawal El Mouwatakel, who in 1984 became the first 
Moroccan woman to win an Olympic gold medal, recently went to Kuwait at Fahd's 
invitation to advise him. 
</P>
<P>
He also assisted in the organization of a symposium on women's sports in Asia, 
which is scheduled for mid-August in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to be influential in international sports," DeFrantz said. "He was 
on the way up." 
</P>
<P>
Elected this summer as vice president of the international soccer federation, 
Fahd was credited for the renewed enthusiasm for the sport in his country. 
Kuwait advanced to the World Cup for the first time in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"He was responsible for new ideas, remodeled stadiums, better coaches and youth 
programs in Kuwait," said Keith Walker, secretary general of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost somebody who contributed to the sports movement in a big way. He 
was a doer, somebody who could get things done all over the world."

</P>
<P>
Evans, swimming her first competitive backstroke at the national meet, was 
third to Olympian Beth Barr, timed in 2:13.16. Evans (2:13.66) also trailed 
Janie Wagstaff (2:13.59).

ITALY ELIMINATES U.S. VOLLEYBALL TEAM

<P>
Italy ended American dreams of another international men's volleyball title 
with a 15-5, 13-15, 15-12, 15-8 victory Friday night at the Goodwill Games in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team, winner of the 1984 and '88 Olympic titles and the dominant 
country in the sport for more than five years, did not have the power or 
experience to match Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians clinched the semifinal match by jumping to a 13-1 lead in the 
final game with 10 consecutive points. The United States came back with seven 
of the next eight points before a ball was blocked and fell outside the court 
to end the match. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't firing on all six tonight," Coach Bill Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
Italy meets the Soviet Union in the final today. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, the Soviets scored their biggest victory of the season, 
upsetting defending World Cup champion Cuba, 12-15, 8-15, 15-10, 15-12 and 
15-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union rallied from a two-game deficit with its blocking and 
consistent kills by 6-foot-7 reserve Alexander Shadchin. 
</P>
<P>
But Soviet Coach Vyacheslav Platonov said the victory was almost secondary to 
the fact that the Soviet had finally arrived on the international scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Our entry into the finals is not as important as is the win today," he said. 
"I've been trying to convince my team that they could beat anyone, and they 
have been trying to prove to me they could lose to anybody. What's important is 
they proved me right." 
</P>
<P>
Cuban Coach Orlando Samuels Blackwood said his team let down "psychologically" 
after winning the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not keep the defense up and we had a letdown," he said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
In diving, the men's one-meter springboard was won by Soviet Sergei Lomonovski, 
the first non-Chinese gold medalist in diving. His consistent performance 
enabled Lomonovski to move away from the field and finish with 597.00 points. 
</P>
<P>
"As the dives went on, I gained confidence and dived better," Lomonovski said. 
"I was better prepared for the one-meter." 
</P>
<P>
Tan Liangde of China, who won the three-meter springboard, earned the silver. 
Mark Bradshaw of Columbus, Ohio, took his second bronze of these games. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lenzi of Fredericksburg, Va., had a poor 10th dive, a 1 1/2 somersault 
with 2 1/2 twists, falling from second to fourth.

BOWMAN, PLAYING IT SAFE, FINISHES SIXTH; BROWNING WINS GOLD MEDAL

It is said that he could be figure skating's king. Instead, Christopher Bowman 
seems to prefer playing the court jester. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a choice of doing it straight or improvising, the 1989 U.S. men's 
champion often makes like Robin Williams. In skating and in life. 
</P>
<P>
In sixth place after the short program at the Goodwill Games, Bowman's 
intentions going into Friday night's free skating program were anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, he said he might be tempted -- again -- to abandon his 
usual routine and ad-lib a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Would he be, as he once proclaimed, "Hans Brinker from hell", or settle for 
Bowman the Showman? 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, neither. He deviated from his plans some, but not entirely by 
design. 
</P>
<P>
A triple axel and a triple salchow both became singles. But only out of 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Having trained for less than a month, Bowman, 23, was out of shape and playing 
it safe. His caution was very out of character. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been somewhat of a glass house lately, wondering when the stones were 
going to come down," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
There were cracks showing after Thursday night's short program, but Bowman 
recovered some with Friday's fairly stylish free-skating routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared I was going to walk away from this event sad and not 
learning anything," Bowman said. "I turned it into something positive." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, from Van Nuys, finished sixth among eight skaters. Canada's Kurt 
Browning, two-time world champion, won the gold medal, with Viktor Petrenko of 
the Soviet Union taking silver and U.S. champion Todd Eldredge placing third 
for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Eldredge was in fifth place after Thursday's original program. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman failed to move up, but he stuck with his program. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a similar situation in March at the World Championships in Halifax, 
Canada, he was full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
In fifth place after the short program, Bowman had a change of plans halfway 
through his free-skating exercise. He decided the routine that he, his coach 
and a handful of other advisers had worked on for months wasn't quite difficult 
enough. It needed a touch more pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
So, after considering his options for a few mili-seconds, Bowman did what any 
true showman would do. He made the rest of it up on the fly. 
</P>
<P>
His daring paid off. He jumped two places in the standings and won a bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Carroll has been Bowman's coach for 18 years, but their relationship has 
been on thin ice since Bowman free-lanced his way through the World 
Championships. Maybe before. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one crazy person in the sport," Carroll once lamented during a 
light-hearted moment, "why is it I have to be the one who coaches him?" 
</P>
<P>
Carroll's comments after the World Championships carried a more serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to remain Christopher's friend, I cannot be his coach," Carroll 
said privately. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll was still with Bowman this week, but seemed none to pleased about it. 
He declined interview requests all week, telling a spokesman he was "tired of 
lying and covering" for Bowman and that he had "nothing positive to say." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, whose list of strait-laced proteges includes Linda Fratianne, seems to 
have tired of Bowman's antics. 
</P>
<P>
As the story goes, when Bowman, a cherubic 5-year-old, used to act up in 
Carroll's class at Van Nuys Iceland, the coach simply picked him up and tossed 
him in a waste basket to show him who was boss. It's not so simple now. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman and Carroll clashed before the Goodwill Games. Bowman wanted to come. 
Carroll didn't. "He was very reluctant about coming to this event because he 
felt they if you're not totally prepared than you shouldn't be going," Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In pairs skating, Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov led a medals sweep by 
the Soviets. Todd Sand and Natasha Kuchiki, the United States' top-ranked team, 
was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also swept the ice-dancing competition, with Sergei Ponomarenko and 
Marina Klimova winning the gold medal.

while awaiting a hearing on civil charges that he squandered the thrift's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles said laws governing 
thrifts do not permit regulators to make Spiegel post the money before his 
hearing. To allow that, Wilson said, would unconstitutionally deprive Spiegel 
of property without due process. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans, 
alleged on July 5 that Spiegel spent nearly $19 million in Columbia funds on 
himself while chief executive of the now-insolvent Beverly Hills-based thrift. 
Spiegel, whose family still controls Columbia, resigned Dec. 31 as head of the 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The charges, part of the largest civil case ever brought against an individual 
by thrift regulators, allege personal use of corporate jets, condominiums and 
concert tickets, as well as making loans to a friend who provided Spiegel with 
luxury cars. Regulators are seeking a $5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS wanted Spiegel to deposit into an escrow account the $19 million he 
allegedly squandered, plus an additional $2.3 million to cover potential losses 
on the sale of three condominiums Columbia now has on the market. They argued 
that Spiegel might seek to hide his assets. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative hearing on the charges is scheduled for Sept. 4 in Los 
Angeles. Spiegel's lawyers said the former executive will soon face additional 
charges. Although they did not say what the charges might be, investigators are 
known to have looked at such areas as Spiegel's extensive security measures, 
costs associated with Columbia's ornate new $55-million headquarters building, 
and use by Spiegel and his family of Columbia's Hyatt Newporter resort in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis M. Perluss, one of Spiegel's lawyers, said Wilson's decision could prove 
significant because it narrows the young agency's authority. Officials from the 
OTS, formed last year as the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 
said they did not want to comment until they have read the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The decision lifts temporary spending restrictions on transferring and selling 
assets that were placed on Spiegel and his wife, Helene. It also returns to 
Spiegel a $1-million bond that he posted.

JOBLESS RATE HITS 5.5%, FUELING RECESSION FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE UNEXPECTED JULY JUMP SENT UNEMPLOYMENT TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN TWO 
YEARS. SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION MAY BE OVER.

<P>
In the most visible sign yet that the economy is flirting with recession, the 
nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.5% in July from 5.3% the previous month, 
while the private sector shed 45,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected increase in the jobless rate -- to its highest level in two 
years -- combined with fears of oil-fueled inflation in the wake of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait, constituted a one-two punch that sent the nation's 
financial markets reeling. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that the eight-year economic expansion is on the verge of stalling, 
traders rushed to unload stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more 
than 120 points in midday trading before recovering somewhat to close down 
54.95. 
</P>
<P>
"This report is devastating," said economist Irwin L. Kellner at Manufacturers 
Hanover in New York. He noted that the jobless figures were foreshadowed by 
last week's report showing that the gross national product had grown at an 
annual rate of only 1.2% in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming on the heels of the GNP report, and its decline in consumption and 
investment, this says the U.S. economy is already in recession," Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
Other economists echoed Kellner's gloomy assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy appears to be caving in to a full-fledged recession," Allen Sinai, 
chief economist at Boston Co., told the Associated Press. "The jump in the 
unemployment rate is the telling sign." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the 
economy "is not going to hang on much longer. It is headed directly into a 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
"We're close to the edge," added Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern 
Trust Co. of Chicago. "It wouldn't take much of a breeze to push us over. . . . 
What's going on in the Middle East may be the breeze to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of 45,000 private-sector jobs were part of a huge overall job loss of 
219,000, including 162,000 layoffs of temporary U.S. Census workers. The 
private-sector loss was the second in four months and far exceeded April's 
weather-related contraction of 26,000. 
</P>
<P>
The slumping construction industry lost 50,000 jobs, while manufacturing 
industries, which have shed 325,000 workers since a post-recession peak in 
March, 1989, lost 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even the service sector, the primary engine of job creation during the past 
decade, gained only 14,000 jobs. Modest increases in retail trade and health 
services were offset by losses in business services and wholesale trade. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in unemployment, which was larger than anticipated despite other signs 
of economic softness, was more pronounced in some sectors. Black unemployment 
jumped to 11.3% from 10.4%, while teen-age joblessness surged to 16.3% from 
14.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Many economic forecasters predicted that the recent 1.2% economic growth rate 
will decline to zero or even become a negative figure the remainder of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Kellner, the Manufacturers Hanover economist, said the Federal Reserve Board 
should disregard potential energy price inflation and concentrate on "easing 
the blow" of a slumping domestic economy by allowing interest rates to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in the unemployment rate "ought to get the message across to the Fed," 
Kellner said. "And if the Fed doesn't get the message, Congress certainly 
will." 
</P>
<P>
However, economist Jerry Jordan of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles said 
he believes that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is more likely to fight 
oil-induced inflation by maintaining or raising rates than to try to protect 
the economy from an economic contraction. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan noted that when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports on August 
employment next month, it also will unveil a large-scale revision of jobs data 
over the past several years, including new statistical classifications and 
updated pricing indexes. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, Jordan said, will almost certainly reduce the number of newly 
created jobs in the reports, perhaps dramatically. For much of the past few 
years, the government's surveys of business establishments have shown steady 
job creation of 250,000 or so each month -- despite a sluggish economy that has 
added barely 1% per year to its output. 
</P>
<P>
The reality seems to have caught up with the numbers, Jordan said, and the jobs 
once thought to have been created now appear to be disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances are now 50-50 we'll end up being told the economy has been in 
recession since last fall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Brinner, an analyst with DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting 
firm, said he expects unemployment to rise as high as 6% by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1988, Brinner noted, non-farm private sector output has grown 
only about 0.6% a year. Yet overall unemployment had held at 5.3% until July, 
while payroll employment appeared to be growing steadily. 
</P>
<P>
"That means we have an employment glut today, and we are beginning to get a 
needed correction," Brinner said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some economists, however, Brinner said the net loss of 7,000 factory 
jobs, after steady monthly declines of 20,000 or more, may suggest a bottoming 
out in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
"There are signs here the correction is coming slowly, and that's good," 
Brinner said. "The reduction in employment growth seems to be coming in 
measured doses, and it may be we can get through the year without panicking." 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that most of the manufacturing job losses 
were in industries producing materials used in construction, while other 
industries, such as fabricated metals and textiles, showed job increases.

U.S. FIRMS ARE UNABLE TO AID STAFF IN KUWAIT

<P>
The fast-moving Iraqi invasion of Kuwait caught many American firms with 
operations in the tiny country off guard, foiling corporate contingency plans 
to evacuate employees and leaving firms powerless to help. 
</P>
<P>
With the airports and seaports in Kuwait shut down, executives familiar with 
crisis management said there is little that U.S. companies can do at the moment 
to get their employees out. They advised the companies to work with the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If companies haven't gone through the simulations that explore the 
consequences of various options in a crisis like this, any evacuation plans 
like the one pulled off by Ross Perot in Iran will not work," said Brian 
Jenkins, managing director of Kroll Associates, an international corporate 
investigation and consulting firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins was referring to the famous incident in which Texas businessman Perot 
hired a retired Vietnam veteran to direct the rescue of two of his employees 
from an Iranian jail in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, if you haven't made preparations in advance, you don't have those 
options, and the evacuation can become perilous to the employees," Jenkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with overseas turmoil is nothing new for many American multinational 
companies, which have often had to act quickly to protect their employees and 
interests abroad. In 1981, Exxon was forced to evacuate dependents of its 
employees in Libya after U.S. Navy fighter planes shot down two Libyan planes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, many firms were forced to airlift employees out of China in the wake 
of the Beijing government's bloody clampdown on student demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuwait "situation is not at all similar to the crisis in Tien An 
Men Square in China," said David Samuel, a political risk consultant in New 
York. "The risk is far greater here because the Iraqis are organized, and 
they're a battle-tested group." 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth corporations often find themselves powerless when it comes to aiding 
their employees overseas. "There is nothing we can do," said Mike Libbey, a 
spokesman for San Francisco-based energy giant Chevron, which has two chemical 
engineers stranded but reportedly safe in a hotel 20 miles outside Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
Recent diplomatic efforts to ease tension between Iraq and Kuwait left many 
firms believing that it was safe to keep their employees in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect this level of conflict," said Debra Williams, spokeswoman 
for Pasadena-based Parsons Corp., an engineering firm with about 100 employees 
and dependents in Kuwait. "If we knew if there was any threat to any of our 
employees, they would have left the country." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the State Department's Kuwaiti Task Force said U.S. Embassy 
officials in Kuwait have reached about 1,000 of the estimated 3,000 Americans 
since Iraq's lightning invasion of the Middle Eastern kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Contingency plans and experience abroad have helped firms cope with emergencies 
ranging from earthquakes to coups d'etat. "We have been in the Middle East for 
30 years, and we have seen many political problems," said Williams at Parsons, 
which has worked on water supply and transportation projects in oil-rich Kuwait 
since the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons' contingency plans called for employees to remain inside their homes or 
office in case of a natural disaster or military attack, and employees have 
done so, Williams said. But some of the company's plans have fallen apart in 
the face of the sweeping Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
When they were notified at their homes, employees were supposed to immediately 
head to the airport for evacuation. That plan was rendered useless when the 
Iraqis shut down the international air terminal shortly after their attack. 
</P>
<P>
The last contact the Pasadena firm had with its Kuwait office was shortly after 
the invasion. At the time, Williams said, several employees were unharmed and 
still at work. "We have not heard from them in over a day," Williams said 
Friday afternoon. "We have been trying phones, fax, Telexes, everything." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Corp. was able to reach two of its employees conducting field work on 
military transport planes that the aerospace firm had sold to Kuwait. "We were 
in contact with them yesterday," a company spokesman. "They are safe and 
believe they are in no danger."

NATION'S FIRMS SCRAMBLE AMID BAN ON IMPORTS

President Bush's order banning imports of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil threw the U.S. 
oil industry into turmoil Friday, and refiners were scrambling to figure out 
just how the order would affect their operations. 
</P>
<P>
* For some oil companies, the embargo meant a frantic search for alternative 
supplies of crude oil on world markets as oil prices shot up on spot markets. 
</P>
<P>
* For others, it meant cutting operations until supplies could be found. 
</P>
<P>
* For still others, it meant hurried negotiations with U.S. Customs Service and 
Treasury Department officials to determine if and how they could take delivery 
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude already sailing to U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
Some company executives gnashed their teeth at former oilman George Bush for 
putting them in this position, political considerations aside. "The Executive 
Order says things that are very counterproductive to American interests," said 
one executive, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said oil companies should be able to find all the oil they need 
eventually, as long as the United States remains alone in its import ban. 
</P>
<P>
Supply disruptions should be short-lived and small scale, though companies will 
unquestionably pay more for their oil than they did a week ago -- price 
increases that are already finding their way to the gasoline pump. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, the U.S. Customs Service issued guidelines that appeared to 
resolve a big question. Oil companies can take delivery of Iraqi and Kuwaiti 
oil that was loaded before Thursday and on its way to the United States -- as 
long as it gets here before Oct. 1. Payments for such oil must go not to Iraq 
or Kuwait but to a special government-controlled account. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign-owned U.S. oil companies such as BP America Inc. (owned by 
British Petroleum) and Shell Oil Co. (owned by Royal Dutch/Shell) could 
conceivably continue buying Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil through their operations 
outside the United States and use other oil supplies for U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies could simply swap supplies on the open market or seek 
alternative oil from nations with excess oil production capacity, such as 
Venezuela and perhaps Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, however, whether those nations would be willing to violate the 
quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month. And 
the nations with the largest excess capacity, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
Emirates, may think twice about expanding their production because they are 
under the threat of Iraqi military action themselves, analysts pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
The spot crude oil price for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade, 
was up more than $1 on Friday to between $24.40 and $24.50 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The largest U.S. users of Iraqi crude are Exxon Corp., Coastal Corp., Shell, 
Fina Oil &amp; Chemical Co., Mobil Corp., Lyondell Petrochemical Co., Chevron 
Corp., Ashland Oil Inc. and Marathon Oil Co., according to industry sources and 
the consulting firm of Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Even for the largest users, Iraqi crude oil accounts for only a small 
percentage of their total supplies of crude; Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil make up less 
than 10% of total U.S. oil imports. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. Customs officials seized a tanker with 312,000 barrels of 
Iraqi crude destined for Coastal, which operates seven refineries in the 
country. That oil remains in custody while Coastal negotiates with Customs 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But Coastal spokeswoman Barbara Johnson in Houston said the company had ample 
supplies from other nations as well as inventories that could cover any 
shortfall caused by the embargo in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Lyondell of Houston, which is 49% owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., was caught 
by surprise in the middle of unloading an oil tanker filled with 525,000 
barrels of Iraqi crude. Crews had removed about two-thirds of the cargo, 
destined for Lyondell's Houston refinery, when Bush's order was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials seized the cargo then released it after negotiations with 
Lyondell led them to conclude that the cargo was no longer Iraqi property. 
</P>
<P>
Lyondell has since scaled back oil use at its refinery to 250,000 barrels a day 
from 290,000 barrels a day in expectation that it will not be able to take 
delivery of several tanker loads of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude still on the open 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
But, spokesman David Harpole said, "we have gone to the spot market and have 
been able to pick up the additional crude we need, and oil supplies do seem to 
be plentiful." 
</P>
<P>
Some Iraqi shipments have already completed their transatlantic crossing but 
have not made deliveries yet to avoid seizure. "We do know of several ships off 
U.S. territorial waters" in the Gulf of Mexico, said Donna De La Torre, a 
spokeswoman for Customs in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Eastern Trust, a tanker carrying 1.9 million barrels of Iraqi 
crude oil, sat in waters just off Pascagoula, Miss., where Chevron has a 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
If Chevron cannot take delivery, "We will have to shuffle some of our crude 
slates (mix of crude used by refineries) around and slow the refinery down as 
well," said Bruce Frolich, vice president of supply and distribution, for 
Chevron U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest replacement supplies, either from the Middle East or from Mexico, 
would take at least a couple of weeks to arrive. "It's a timing situation," 
Frolich said.

McDonald's to Help East German Farmers: Up against a campaign to stop its Big 
Mac hamburger from crossing the crumbling Berlin Wall, McDonald's Corp. 
promised to help East Germany's farmers by buying their produce. 
</P>
<P>
A West German supplier of the fast-food giant has signed a deal with a 
cooperative farm near Magdeburg, close to the East German border, McDonald's 
Germany Chairman Walter Rettenwender said. East German politicians want to ban 
McDonald's and similar fast-food firms, saying their throwaway plastic cartons 
will cause huge disposal problems. But McDonald's is hoping that opinion will 
change as it helps bolster East Germany's sagging agricultural industry.

Court Backs Agency's Right to Sue Brokers: A federal appeals court ruled that 
the Securities Investor Protection Corp., an agency created by Congress to 
protect securities investors, can sue fraudulent brokers for racketeering and 
seek triple damages. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court said SIPC can use the powerful 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in civil suits against 
brokers. SIPC reimburses customers of failed brokers and can appoint a receiver 
to sell or liquidate an insolvent brokerage that has violated the law.

Coca-Cola Co., an Atlanta landmark, on Friday opened a downtown pavilion that 
is giant advertisement, ode to nostalgia and invitation to feel good all rolled 
into one. 
</P>
<P>
The $15-million building near popular Underground Atlanta houses historical 
exhibits, a full-sized soda fountain and 1,000 artifacts that trace the history 
of the 104-year-old soft drink company. Officials describe the materials as 
priceless. 
</P>
<P>
Coke advertising jingles from years past bounce around the three-story 
building. The experience seems at once high tech and old-fashioned. Most of 
all, it is unabashedly promotional. A gift shop offers Coke clothing and 
what-nots in the familiar red and white. Daring to be honest, the company even 
displays a little material on New Coke, its notorious marketing disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone pay $2.50 admission to enter the World of Coca-Cola, a world 
of Coke ads? Company officials offer a simple answer: People love it. The 
company that wants "to teach the world to sing" is offering a feel-good product 
in feel-bad times. Admission for the entire first weekend already is sold out 
-- about 4,500 visitors a day. Officials estimate that a half million people 
will visit the pavilion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Dolly Casey of Akron, Ohio, was among a crowd of several hundred who attended 
Friday's opening, which included speeches by the mayor and governor, romping 
clowns, singing children and an assortment of spirited bands. Dolly and her 
husband, Jack, were too late to buy admission tickets but were hoping to get 
inside the building before leaving town. Being around all that upbeat Cokeness 
"just makes you feel better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson touched on the 
Coke mystique, a feeling that seems to go beyond the city's appreciation for 
the publicity and the payroll generated by the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
"Coca-Cola means more than a drink," Jackson declared. "It's a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the soft drink advertisements mirror time periods in American society 
-- uniformly white back in the early 1900s, gradually adding people of color in 
more recent years. A high-definition television theater shows Coke ads in 
exotic settings around the world. In another exhibit, touch-screen technology 
offers snippets of news from five-year periods, beginning with 1886, when 
Coca-Cola was first served in an Atlanta pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since pharmacist John S. Pemberton created the concoction, collectors have 
sought practically any artifact connected with it. At the pavilion opening, 
Bruce Crim of Tallapoosa, Ga., just couldn't wait to get a look inside. At 
home, he said, he has a room full of bottles, clocks, cuff links, dispensing 
machines and "anything I can find." 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because the stuff is old, he said, because it reminds him of the good old 
times he had in the good old days. All of that, he said, "feels good." 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola officials concede that the pavilion, which is not expected to be a 
money-maker, will serve as a grand ad. However, they point out that, with 
worldwide sales of more than $9 billion last year, the company is hardly 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, much of the memorabilia had languished in storage at Coca-Cola 
headquarters, company spokesmen said. Officials say that at least 40,000 
visitors a year were trekking to the headquarters already. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Coca-Cola President Donald R. Keough said visitors from around 
the world "want to touch Coca-Cola because as they've grown up, it's been part 
of their lives."

AT&amp;T PAYING $191.8 MILLION TO RAISE SUN MICRO SHARE TO 14.7%

<P>
Sun Microsystems Inc. said Friday that it has agreed to sell about 4.6 million 
shares of common stock to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. for $191.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, when completed, will boost the amount of Sun stock that AT&amp;T has 
acquired directly from the Mountain View-based computer company to 14.7%. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based AT&amp;T had previously bought about 11% of Sun's stock directly 
from the company, Sun officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1988 agreement, Sun can sell newly created shares to AT&amp;T 
representing up to 15% of its total shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, AT&amp;T is also permitted to buy up to an additional 5% 
of Sun's common stock in the open market by January, 1991. That would bring its 
interest in Sun to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Sun officials said AT&amp;T had bought additional Sun shares in open market 
purchases. But they did not have an estimate as to how much. 
</P>
<P>
Sun's stock closed up 25 cents to $30.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T officials were not immediately available for comment.

LORAL SIGNS CASH DEAL TO ACQUIRE FORD AEROSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Loral Corp., a New York-based defense electronics company, said Friday that it 
signed a definitive agreement to buy Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace Corp. 
for $715 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price is lower than industry analysts expected when Ford Motor Co. 
put the defense and communications subsidiary up for sale in January. 
</P>
<P>
But industry sources said Loral's actual cost could be nearly $900 million if 
debt and other liabilities are included. 
</P>
<P>
Ford announced July 23 that it had selected Loral as the winning bidder for its 
Ford Aerospace unit. Loral, in a joint venture with Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Inc., beat out competing offers from groups led by Hughes Aircraft Co. and 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is subject to government approval, is expected to close within 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard L. Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said Loral, as part 
of the deal, will assume $20 million in short-term debt and commit about $160 
million in employee benefit obligations. But he said those liabilities will be 
balanced out by other assets, which include an overfunded pension plan for Ford 
Aerospace's 17,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Ford reportedly had sought cash bids of $1.2 billion when it put the defense 
unit up for sale in January. But the bids came in much lower as prospects for 
the defense industry grew bleaker with the melting of Cold War tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said the deal was not subject to any financing conditions.

Long-term bond prices plunged again Friday as high unemployment and Middle East 
tensions battered the rumor-riddled credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
But short-term interest rates were hammered down after the Labor Department 
reported that the nation's unemployment rate shot up to 5.5% in July from 5.2% 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
The report was another sign that the nation's faltering economy may be heading 
into a recession, which could herald lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 1 1/8 points, or $11.25 per 
$1,000 in face value, on top of losses Thursday of more than $12. The bond's 
yield climbed to 8.56% from 8.45% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the unemployment report, combined with a wave of other negative 
economic data in recent days, normally would give the Federal Reserve enough 
reason to lower interest rates, which would boost bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment was reflected among shorter-maturity bills and bonds. But the 
longer end of the market was gripped by the belief that the spike in oil prices 
would fuel inflation worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which the Fed seeks to control through monetary policy, erodes the 
value of fixed-income securities such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The long end of the market was wracked by speculation about events in the 
Middle East, including unconfirmed rumors that Iraq was poised to possibly 
invade Saudi Arabia after its seizure of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A serious escalation of hostilities in the region could push oil prices even 
higher, worsening the inflation and economic outlook. However, late in the day, 
Iraq said it planned to begin removing its troops from Kuwait on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7.85%, down from 8% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds closed at 92 3/4, down 3/8. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.34% 
from 7.31% late Thursday.

Dollar Advances in Volatile Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar climbed against most major currencies in volatile trading as dealers 
divided their attention between the Middle East crisis and the unemployment 
data, which indicated that the U.S. economy may be on the verge of recession. 
</P>
<P>
Investors unloaded dollars early in the U.S. trading day, reacting to the 
unemployment report. 
</P>
<P>
But the turmoil in the Middle East kept dealers on guard against selling 
dollars aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in oil prices since Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait early Thursday has 
been a key reason for the dollar's advance. Oil transactions are conducted in 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"There still was a great deal of buying interest," said Kevin Lawrie, treasury 
manager at the Bank of Boston's office in New York. "No one's comfortable going 
home short of dollars over the weekend when anything can happen out there." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Iraqi troops had begun an assault on Saudi Arabia temporarily gave 
investors an extra incentive to buy dollars as a safe-haven currency. 
</P>
<P>
When the word came later in the session that Iraq planned to withdraw its 
troops from Kuwait over the weekend, the dollar buying subsided somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
By the time trading was done in New York, the dollar stood at 149.925 Japanese 
yen, up from 149.30 yen Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 149.35 
Japanese yen from 148.90 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 
149.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling's value against the dollar dipped in the United States. One British 
pound fetched $1.85375 late in New York, compared to $1.8545 late Thursday. In 
London, the pound rose to $1.8570 from $1.8495 late Thursday.

Oil Futures Soar on Supply Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Recession fears and inflation worries, coupled with conflicting reports from 
the Persian Gulf, ricocheted through U.S. commodity markets, resulting in price 
moves with little relation to supply and demand factors. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a lot of attention was focused on what the latest rumors were," 
observed Tim Evans, a copper trader with Deak International Inc., a New 
York-based dealer of metals and currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Oil futures ended sharply higher, despite active selling late in the session; 
precious metals were higher; copper futures fell; livestock and meat were 
mixed, and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Commodity traders kept close watch on stock and crude markets, where changing 
news reports about the Iraq-Kuwait situation caused wild price swings that 
rippled out to other markets. 
</P>
<P>
The recession fears weighed heavily on the copper market, which is especially 
sensitive to signs of economic weakness, and on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 2.4 to 3.4 cents lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
with the contract for delivery in August at $1.261 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Skyrocketing oil futures contributed to inflation fears, which prompted buying 
in the precious metal and soybean markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gold for current delivery settled at $377.40 an ounce, up 60 cents on New 
York's Commodity Exchange; silver was 0.5 to 0.7 cent higher, with August at 
$4.842 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled 2 to 4.5 cents lower, with 
September at $2.805 a bushel; corn was 1.25 to 3.25 cents lower, with September 
at $2.495 a bushel; oats were 4.75 to 7 cents lower, with September at $1.14 a 
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 6.25 cents higher, with August at $5.865 
a bushel.

HAVEN'T HIT BOTTOM, ANALYSTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT BESIDES THE MIDEAST 
SITUATION, SOME ANALYSTS WARN, SUCH AS THE BUDGET DEFICIT AND INFLATION.

Wall Street's bounce back from its lows Friday encouraged some analysts, who 
say the market now appears more likely to avoid a one-day meltdown similar to 
the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many experts believe that stocks are almost certainly headed lower 
before any significant rebound begins. 
</P>
<P>
Some key growth stocks managed to gain in late trading Friday, after heavy 
selling Thursday and early Friday. Compaq Computer, for example, finished up 
$1.375 to $54.50 for the day, having traded as low as $49.75. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Wal-Mart, one of the market's premier growth stocks, finished up 50 
cents to $30.375 after trading as low as $28.50. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 54.95 points to 2,809.65, after 
being down about 123 points around mid-morning. The recovery was fueled by 
expectations that Iraq will soon withdraw from Kuwait. News of the invasion on 
Thursday had started a chain reaction that shook financial markets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Investors' willingness Friday to return to selected growth stocks -- which had 
led the market's spring rally -- suggested that pessimism hasn't become extreme 
enough to allow a devastating one-day decline. Bargain hunting for growth 
stocks indicates a belief on the part of some money managers that the economy 
isn't headed for a severe recession, despite warning signals to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Anderson, head of the pension arm of Minneapolis investment giant IDS, 
said his firm was a buyer Friday of such stocks as Procter &amp; Gamble, Toys R 
Us, Philip Morris, Great Western Financial and Liz Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a lot more optimistic than a lot of people," Anderson conceded. He 
believes that any inflation spike from higher oil prices will be temporary and 
that the economy will continue to grow, albeit at a slow rate. 
</P>
<P>
But many analysts noted that much or most of the buying Friday was by the two 
groups that are charged with absorbing stock when no one else will: brokerage 
firms and New York Stock Exchange specialists. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff "was really not a full purge," said David Holt, technical analyst 
at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. He believes that the market has 
further to drop as worried investors bail out. A decline of 5% more, which Holt 
says is possible, would take the Dow down another 140 points, to about 2,670. 
That would be an 11% drop from the Dow's peak of 2,999.75 in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, noting that many stocks have already fallen far more than 11% 
from their highs, say the Dow could end up as much as 15% off from its peak 
before the selling ebbs. "I see at least a 10% to 15% correction," said William 
Raftery, technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. 
A 15% drop would mean a Dow of 2,550 -- its bottom in late February. 
</P>
<P>
But the art of predicting market bottoms is as difficult as it ever has been, 
experts say. Any renewed optimism that may develop in the short term could be 
swept away by another Iraqi military move or by another sign that the economy 
is sinking into recession. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though trading volume has been heavy, many investors seem to be 
resisting panic. The Vanguard Group mutual fund company in Valley Forge, Pa., 
reported Friday that few individual investors were doing much selling. "People 
just wanted to call and talk. There's a lot of jabbering but no real action," 
said spokesman Brian Mattes. 
</P>
<P>
William Patternotte, research chief for the Alex. Brown &amp; Sons brokerage in 
Baltimore, said big investors he met with Thursday and Friday were calm. "I 
certainly don't sense any panic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many investors obviously have been dumping stocks. And the bears 
say the Iraqi invasion simply gave investors an excuse to react to a long 
string of bad news in recent months, which up until now stocks had blithely 
ignored: falling corporate earnings, a budget crisis in Washington and a 
troubling undercurrent of inflation in a weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
Those events are more likely to mean further selling ahead than a fast rebound, 
the bears say. "All Iraq did was accelerate what was going to happen anyway," 
said Charles LaLoggia, who writes the Special Situation Report market 
newsletter in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
He is among the most bearish market analysts, predicting that the Dow won't 
bottom until it hits 1,500 to 1,700 within two years. LaLoggia sees a severe 
recession that will shake the foundations of the nation's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts refuse to believe that the economy could be in that much trouble. 
And while the market may go lower in the short term, some experts remind 
investors that all market cycles -- bull and bear -- seem to have been 
compressed into increasingly shorter time frames in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Corrections that used to last a couple of months now last a few weeks or a few 
days," says Gene Seagle, technical analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co. in Stamford, 
Conn. If the economy avoids recession and Mideast tensions ease, by fall the 
current turmoil may be a distant memory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
HOW SOME KEY STOCKS FARED 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Dow industrials' 54.95-point loss Friday, some key growth stocks 
managed to rebound in late trading -- which some analysts take as a positive 
sign that the market isn't likely to collapse on Monday. Still, many stocks 
suffered sharp losses.

INVASION SPARKS JUMP IN OIL AND GASOLINE PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KRENSAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists across the country saw gasoline prices surge about a nickel a gallon 
at most outlets Friday, as the price of crude oil soared on fears of a widening 
Middle East conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline stations raised pump prices 4 to 14 cents a gallon, following 
wholesale price increases by major U.S. oil companies amid fears that Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait could disrupt oil production throughout the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield, the leading retailer on the West Coast, raised its 
wholesale prices for unleaded gasoline by 4 cents a gallon Friday afternoon. 
Chevron, the No. 2 West Coast retailer, increased the prices to its dealers by 
5 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal said it planned to increase its wholesale gasoline prices 2 cents a 
gallon beginning at 12:01 a.m. today. Among the other companies also announcing 
price increases were Mobil Oil Corp., by an average of 3.5 cents a gallon; BP 
America Inc., by 4 cents and 5 cents, and Texaco, by as much as 7 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Some consumers reacted with outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil companies are going to screw us one way or another," said Ventura 
resident John Carrington at a Quality station in Chatsworth. "There's not a 
hell of a lot we can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Carrington also said the gas-price increase is another indication of the danger 
of U.S. dependence on foreign oil. "We're selling off the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocates also hurled accusations of price gouging. They maintained 
that U.S. oil inventories are sufficient to avert broad price increases. One 
analyst estimated that commercial crude oil inventories in this country total 
385 million barrels, about 60 million barrels greater than this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
"All the analysts say we have plenty of supply, internationally and 
domestically; it is not a reflection of a shortage of oil," said consumer 
advocate Ed Rothschild with Citizen Action in Washington. "It is simply a panic 
market, and oil companies are using that panic to drive up prices in the short 
term." But oil company representatives defended the increases, saying that 
dealers' replacement costs surge almost immediately during times of production 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
Refineries hiked wholesale gasoline prices a total of 10 to 12 cents a gallon 
Thursday and Friday, estimated Michael Doyle, a St. Paul analyst, even though 
the oil from which the gasoline had been produced was purchased at the old, 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we have the supply, but when we look at the retailer's point of view, his 
cost of inventory replacement has gone up 10 to 12 cents a gallon," Doyle said. 
"When he sends for a load of gasoline to replace his tanks, he pays more." 
</P>
<P>
George Babikian, president of Arco Products Company, Atlantic Richfield's 
refining and marketing division, described a chain reaction that forces oil 
companies to match competitors' price increases or face a flood of business 
that would deplete inventories. And he said that thin inventories leave oil 
companies more vulnerable to price fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between shortage and glut throughout the world is only 2%," he 
said. "When you have the kind of disruption in the Middle East that we have 
now, that could have very serious long-term ramifications for the crude oil 
supply." 
</P>
<P>
A few analysts blamed small retailers -- who often set prices independently -- 
of profiteering from the Mideast turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices surged Friday for the second day on rumors that Iraq might invade 
Saudi Arabia. The September contract price for West Texas Intermediate, the 
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose $1.38 to $24.49 a barrel in trading on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange after peaking during the day at $26.25. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's increase follows a $1.57 increase Thursday. Gasoline prices typically 
increase 2 to 5 cents a gallon for every $1 increase in crude prices. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle estimated that higher oil prices could drive retail prices another 5 to 
10 cents a gallon higher by Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, I would have said a little closer to 5 cents than 10 cents," he 
said. "I would say a little closer to 10 cents today." 
</P>
<P>
The rising oil prices will bring consumers costlier airline tickets, too. 
Northwest Airlines announced Friday that it would add $8 each way to the price 
of domestic tickets beginning Aug. 9. The carrier cited increased fuel costs, 
"since the military invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi troops in the Middle East." It 
said its fuel prices had increased 8 cents a gallon since Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers gassing up at a Chevron station in Torrance expressed a mixture of 
disgust and resignation about the newly pumped up gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I got gas here earlier this week, after that new nickel gas tax went into the 
price, and now it's up 8 cents or a dime since then," said Robert Nance, 48, of 
Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"This, based on any rational thinking, has nothing to do with the invasion," he 
said. "This is profiteering, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Schultz, 36, of San Pedro, shrugged off the increase as insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
"They use any excuse to pump the price up anyway," Schultz said. "There's no 
point in getting upset about it. I didn't even know that it had gone up until 
you mentioned it." 
</P>
<P>
But even the gas station workers were bowled over by the new prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to work today and said, 'Wow! Eight more cents overnight?' and then I 
thought, I'm sure glad I wrecked my car," said Tony Marzilli, a 16-year-old 
attendant. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Liang, manager of a Mobil station in Chatsworth, said that on Mobil's 
orders she raised prices at her station by four cents a gallon Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"First the tax," she said, referring to the 5-cent-a-gallon, state-mandated 
price rise that took effect Wednesday, "and then this. 
</P>
<P>
"People are complaining," Liang said.

NEW POLITICAL MAP OF L.A. COUNTY OKD; 
</P>
<P>
VOTING RIGHTS: JUDGE APPROVES PLAN AIMED AT ELECTING A LATINO SUPERVISOR. 
JUNE'S ELECTION RESULTS ARE TOSSED OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A federal judge on Friday approved a reapportionment plan for the Board of 
Supervisors that dramatically realigns political representation for many of Los 
Angeles County's 8 1/2 million residents, and he threw out the results of the 
June election in the 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon approved new district boundaries drawn by 
civil rights groups that are designed to help a Latino win a seat on the 
powerful five-member board. The new map also threatens to end a decade of 
conservative control of the county's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
In a half-page order, Kenyon canceled the November runoff between Sarah Flores 
and Gregory O'Brien for the seat being vacated by retiring Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum. The judge ordered a new primary Nov. 6 in the redrawn 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
The court-ordered plan carves out a predominantly Latino district bearing the 
designation of Schabarum's 1st District. It stretches from El Sereno and 
Lincoln Heights, through downtown Los Angeles, east to Irwindale and La Puente 
and southeast to Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The map was drafted by a UCLA professor of urban planning on behalf of the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil 
Liberties Union, plaintiffs in the historic voting rights case against the 
nation's most populous county. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon had turned to the plaintiffs' plans on Wednesday after rejecting a map 
offered by the board's three-member conservative majority, calling it a 
"nonsensical distortion" of districts that was "insensitive" to blacks and 
Latinos. Kenyon ruled June 4 that the five Anglo supervisors intentionally 
discriminated against the county's 3 million Latinos when drawing district 
boundaries in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos make up a third of the county's population, but no Latino has served on 
the board since 1875. The county is appealing Kenyon's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum said he was "thrilled" by the ruling. "It means 
that for the first time in the history of this county, the Hispanic community 
is on equal footing," he said, "and that all qualified candidates are going to 
have a fair and equal opportunity to serve on the most powerful body of local 
government in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
County attorney John E. McDermott said he will send a clerk to the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals as soon as the office opens Monday to file papers 
seeking an immediate stay of Kenyon's order. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich accused Kenyon of "working hand in hand 
with the ACLU and MALDEF in pursuit of their liberal ideological agenda." 
Antonovich said he is confident the decision will be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the composition of Schabarum's 1st District increases from 
the present 49% Latino to 71% Latino. Latinos represent 51% of registered 
voters of the redrawn 1st District. The district, which is now 50% Democratic 
and 41% Republican and tends to vote for conservatives, would become 66.5% 
Democratic and 23.3% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's decision opens up the race for Schabarum's seat to new candidates. It 
means that Flores and O'Brien, if they remain candidates, would have to run new 
primary campaigns. They could face some of the same candidates they beat in 
June, plus such veteran Latino politicians as Los Angeles City Council members 
Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina and U.S. Reps. Ed Roybal (D-Los Angeles) and 
Esteban Torres (D-La Puente). 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a bum deal, but I'm going to run," said Flores, who took out a 
$12,000 loan on her home to run for supervisor and spent $400,000 in campaign 
funds to finish first with 35% of the vote in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this case has been more about politics than voting rights," said 
Flores, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, a Superior Court judge and a Republican, said, "I think we need to see 
what the court of appeals does. I am still very much a candidate. . . . I'm not 
ready to throw in the towel yet." 
</P>
<P>
After Kenyon's ruling, O'Brien went to West Covina where 100 supporters had 
gathered for the opening of a new campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, O'Brien said that unless Kenyon's ruling is reversed on appeal, he will 
probably drop out of the race. "If you're going to run for office and the 
friends and neighbors you work with and grow up with can't vote for you, well, 
you have to think about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Rosenbaum, an attorney for the Justice Department, was unsympathetic 
toward Flores and O'Brien, telling the judge that the candidates knew the 
election might be thrown out when they decided to run. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said, "I anticipate being a candidate. But the important thing now is 
to do everything humanly possible to have a united Hispanic community." 
</P>
<P>
The court-ordered plan puts the Glendora homes of Flores and O'Brien in 
Antonovich's new 5th District. But Kenyon waived residency requirements so that 
residents of the existing 1st District could run in the redrawn district. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, who decided not to file for reelection in March, could file to run, 
but his chief deputy said he doubts that Schabarum would do so. Schabarum could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon asked the plaintiffs to prepare for his approval a schedule for filing 
papers to run in the new 1st District. During a court hearing Friday, a Justice 
Department attorney proposed a filing deadline of Aug. 15. That would give 
candidates 83 days to campaign for the seat, the same amount of time between 
the March filing deadline and the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon ordered a Nov. 6 election in the redrawn 1st District, despite testimony 
Friday by County Registrar-Recorder Charles Weissburd that it is too late to 
get ready for such an election. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorney Rosenbaum had argued, "The inequities for Hispanic 
citizens and all citizens of Los Angeles County . . . outweigh any 
inconvenience to the county." 
</P>
<P>
The map approved by the judge shifts supervisors to many new neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman loses East Los Angeles from his current 3rd District. He 
retains his Westside political base and picks up Malibu and Santa Monica from 
4th District Supervisor Deane Dana and more of the San Fernando Valley from 
Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's 5th District still includes Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena and 
picks up a part of the San Gabriel Valley now represented by Schabarum, 
including Azusa, Claremont, Pomona, San Dimas, Temple City and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Dana's coastal district is extended north into the San Gabriel Valley to 
include Diamond Bar, Downey, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, Norwalk, Walnut and 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn's 2nd District, which takes in South-Central Los 
Angeles, emerges only slightly changed. It picks up heavily black Compton from 
Dana in an effort to avoid diluting the voting rights of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
As a "hedge against future discrimination," Justice Department attorney 
Rosenbaum asked Kenyon to require supervisors for 15 years to submit any 
changes in district boundaries to Kenyon or the U.S. attorney general for 
approval. The judge has not acted on the request. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon still must issue a formal order to implement the new plan.

REDISTRICTING PLAN APPROVED 
</P>
<P>
In June, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon ruled that the Los Angeles County 
supervisors violated the voting rights of Latinos when drawing district lines 
in 1981. Earlier this week, Kenyon rejected a county redistricting plan, saying 
that it was insensitive to the rights of Latinos and blacks. And on Friday, he 
accepted one of three alternative plan submitted by plaintiffs in the historic 
voting rights suit. The plan -- prepared by the American Civil Liberties Union 
and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- provides a 
Latino majority in a newly drawn 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling blocked a November runoff election in the 1st District 
between Sarah Flores and Gregory O'Brien. The new map places the homes of 
Flores and O'Brien in Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 5th District. But the 
judge's ruling would allow Flores and O'Brien to run in the 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
Below are the existing district boundaries drawn in 1981, and the new boundarie 
accepted by the judge on Friday.

THREAT TO OIL CONJURES UP SPECTER OF '70S STAGFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's seizure of Kuwait's oil facilities has revived an economic specter that 
vanished with the gas lines of the 1970s: stagflation, a U.S. economy squeezed 
between rising consumer prices and sinking business activity. 
</P>
<P>
As was the case with the 1973-74 Middle East oil crisis, oil prices now 
threaten to push up inflation at a time of growing unemployment and economic 
sluggishness. Indeed, the word stagflation -- forgotten during the boom years 
of the 1980s -- is creeping back into the economic vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that stagflation is back," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief 
economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic forecasting 
center, agreed. Stagflation, he said, "is as good as any word you could use for 
this period." 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East conflict adds a note of confusion to a period in which the U.S. 
economy tilts precariously close to a recession. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest indicator of the economy's weakness, the Labor Department 
reported Friday that unemployment rose to 5.5% in July from 5.2% in June, the 
highest level in two years. The economy's rickety shape already had been 
underscored by gauges of consumer spending, construction and factory orders in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp boost in oil prices -- by drawing away consumer spending and raising 
the cost of business -- could throw the economy into a recession, analysts 
said. "With the economy already sluggish, that could be enough to make the 
difference" and spur a full-blown recession, Ratajczak said. 
</P>
<P>
Rising oil prices and a sluggish economy also pose a dilemma for policy-makers: 
If they cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, they could aggravate 
inflation even more. But failing to act could lead to a recession. In effect, 
stagflation is the worst of both worlds; normally, when economic growth slows, 
inflation is not a major threat. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts are quick to point out important differences between 
today and the 1970s, differences that make acute stagflation -- featuring 
rampant price hikes -- unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economic machine is less dependent on oil than it used to be, and 
inflation remains a much weaker force than in the past. "I don't like to use 
the term 'stagflation' because it implies permanence, that we're stuck with 
inflation and slow growth," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Fidelity 
Bank in Philadelphia. "I don't think we're stuck with it." 
</P>
<P>
A rough rule of thumb holds that a $1-a-barrel hike in the price of oil 
translates to a onetime 0.1% rise in consumer prices. Futures prices for West 
Texas Intermediate crude oil -- the benchmark U.S. grade -- have shot up $10 a 
barrel since June, about half of that in this week alone. Thus some experts 
expect the higher oil prices to add as much as 1 percentage point to the 
consumer price index, which shows inflation now rising at about a 5% annual 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the past, such a rise may seem tame. Still, since the invasion by 
Iraq, investors have behaved as if the clock were turned back to 1973-74 -- the 
period of the first oil shock. On Thursday and Friday, nerve-wracked investors 
sent stocks and bonds plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at what's going on in the markets right now -- they're saying: 'What 
happened in 1973?' Let's act accordingly," observed Ratajczak. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1973, however, the world -- and U.S. industry -- have changed. That year, 
oil represented 46.9% of total U.S. energy usage, according to the Department 
of Energy. By last year, oil's role had slipped to 42.1%. It now takes 28% less 
energy to produce $1 worth of goods than it did in 1973, according to Ronald J. 
Planting, a senior analyst with the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, today's economic climate is less friendly to inflation than was the 
case two decades ago. Wage settlements often fail to keep up with price rises 
these days, according to economists -- in marked contrast to an earlier era 
when wages and prices seemed to soar in an endless spiral. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is so listless that even higher prices for gasoline and 
heating oil are not expected to set off anything like the double-digit price 
hikes of the past. Large regions, including New England and New York, are 
already suffering recessions. California and the West have more buoyant 
economies, but cutbacks in defense and a poor housing market are taking a toll 
on growth. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the varied weaknesses, higher oil prices "are not going to bring 
inflation roaring back," maintains Christopher N. Caton, director of 
forecasting at DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
But some of those concerned about stagflation see the potential for inflation 
in a very different light. 
</P>
<P>
Kellner, for example, points out that inflation in various services has risen 
substantially over the last year. In the last 12 months, costs for medical care 
and public transportation have risen 9.2%. Tuition and other school fees are up 
8.1%, he said, in contrast to a 3.8% inflation rate for goods during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Others wonder if the inflationary effect of a flurry of statewide tax increases 
has been fully recognized. At least a dozen states have raised taxes or fees 
for the 1991 fiscal year to get needed income, according to the National Assn. 
of State Budget Officers in Washington. California, for example, just 
implemented a new 5-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
And "a nickel more a gallon is a price increase," said Robert T. Falconer, an 
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a securities firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a U.S. economy that simultaneously is threatened by inflation and slow 
growth becomes a more troublesome creature for U.S. policy-makers than the more 
simple, sluggish version before the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, when inflation seemed less of a problem, many analysts 
expected the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates to stimulate the 
economy. Now -- even though the economy remains dangerously sluggish -- the new 
wild card of oil-driven price rises makes lower interest rates a far trickier 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
If the Fed pushes interest rates up to fight inflation, "it will create 
recession," warns Ratajczak. "If the Fed fights recession, it certifies 
inflation -- it makes it happen." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Fed officials may have some time to ponder the altered state of 
affairs. "Oil prices are going to be under pressure for quite some time," said 
economist Falconer. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.5% in July. D1

U.S., SOVIETS ASK WORLD TO CUT OFF WEAPONS TO IRAQ

<P>
The United States and Soviet Union, moving swiftly in their first joint attempt 
to end a post-Cold War international crisis, appealed to the world Friday for 
an across-the-board arms embargo against Iraq and demanded that it cease its 
"brutal and illegal" invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic episode showing the new and emerging relationship between the 
superpowers, Secretary of State James A. Baker III cut short a visit to 
Mongolia to fly the breadth of the Soviet Union to hammer out a common 
U.S.-Soviet response to the invasion with Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting for 90 minutes in a second-floor room at Vnukovo-2 airport on the 
outskirts of Moscow, both men emerged shortly after 9 p.m. local time (11 a.m. 
PDT) to read a toughly worded statement accusing Iraq, a longtime Soviet ally, 
of illegal and barbarous action. And they committed their countries to 
coordinating a worldwide response. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we take the unusual step of jointly calling on the rest of the 
international community to join with us in an international cutoff of all arms 
supplies to Iraq," said the U.S.-Soviet resolution, whose English-language text 
was read by Baker before a battery of TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The superpowers accused Iraq of "blatant transgression of the basic norms of 
civilized conduct" and warned its rulers that "governments that engage in 
blatant aggression must know that the international community cannot and will 
not acquiesce." It said Iraq's troops must be withdrawn "unconditionally." 
</P>
<P>
The statement did not refer to possible military action, and Shevardnadze said 
none was planned by the Kremlin. He said he understood from Baker that the Bush 
Administration, which has imposed a trade embargo on Iraq and frozen its U.S. 
assets, has no wish to intervene with armed force. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker would not be drawn out on U.S. intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's useful to speculate with respect to questions regarding 
military action," Baker said as he and Shevardnadze fielded questions at the 
VIPs-only airport, where Baker's Boeing 707 brought the weary American 
entourage after a nearly 9-hour flight from Ulan Bator, Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, which on Thursday broke off weapons supplies to Iraq, has been 
Baghdad's principal arms supplier for more than 20 years. And Shevardnadze said 
his country had been forced to make a conscious choice between longstanding 
ties to the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the logic of 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We were forced to take such steps (to condemn Iraq) by the events in Kuwait, 
in line with the new political thinking," Shevardnadze said. Baker replied that 
the joint statement was "even more meaningful" because of the longstanding ties 
between the Soviets and Iraqis, enshrined in the countries' 1972 treaty of 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
In a larger sense, the joint declaration signaled that Third World countries 
can no longer exploit superpower rivalry to win military and economic support 
in quarrels with their neighbors -- an ingredient in world politics that made 
the 1970s and early 1980s often seem like a global chess game played by the 
United States and Soviet Union, from Ethiopia to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
A principal factor underlying Friday's extraordinary U.S.-Soviet statement was 
the desire by both countries to avoid setting some sort of precedent of 
appeasement, said a senior State Department official traveling with Baker back 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If you allow someone to engage in this kind of action and get away with it, 
you're going to invite more of it -- and not only in this case, but maybe 
others, not necessarily limited to Iraq and not necessarily limited to (the 
Persian Gulf) region," he said during a refueling stop in Shannon, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who had met with Shevardnadze in the Siberian city of Irkutsk before 
flying Thursday to Mongolia, had briefed his host then on the massing of Iraqi 
troops near Kuwait. But Shevardnadze said he had nonetheless been surprised by 
Baghdad's subsequent drive into the oil-rich emirate. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think that the Iraqis would engage in such aggression against 
such a defenseless country, a country which is a threat to no one," the Soviet 
foreign minister admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The senior State Department official traveling with Baker confirmed that the 
initiative for the joint statement had come from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what might happen if the current U.S.-Soviet efforts against Iraq do not 
work, the senior official replied, "Well, we've just begun this process." 
</P>
<P>
In a scathing commentary Friday, the official Soviet news agency Tass also 
expressed shock at the Iraqi action and indicated that the Kremlin was fearful 
of military conflict boiling over in an area near its own southern border, just 
as it had been during the long Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no expectation that the U.S.-Soviet resolution would suffice 
to end the crisis over Kuwait, representatives from both countries hailed the 
document as proof of the new working relationship between the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's natural today that the United States and the Soviet Union would 
find themselves in agreement with respect to what's happened," Baker said. 
"This would not necessarily have been the case at an earlier time, and we might 
have been in earlier days viewing this very tragic action through an East-West 
prism." 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this joint statement does not stop the crisis, it sets an important 
precedent for the future," said a Soviet Foreign Ministry specialist on the 
United States, who accompanied Shevardnadze to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that his country had roundly condemned the Bush Administration for 
last December's Panama invasion and that the Kremlin itself had withdrawn its 
troops from Afghanistan only this past year, the Soviet diplomat said: "The key 
word is 'past.' All that now is in the past. Now we absolutely oppose violence 
as a way to solve international disputes." 
</P>
<P>
The senior State Department official agreed that the joint statement is "a 
measure of how the two of us (the Soviet Union and the United States) can in 
fact deal with issues that in the past we would not have dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
"And in my mind," he added, "it's symptomatic of how the agenda we have with 
them is an expanding agenda. We face a situation where threats to peace don't 
exist in Europe any more, but they exist elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The statement on Kuwait was the first orchestrated U.S.-Soviet joint response 
to a sudden international crisis, but in the past 12 months their positions on 
protracted conflicts like Namibia and Cambodia have merged. Although the 
Baker-Shevardnadze talks in Irkutsk failed to result in accord on Afghanistan, 
the longest-running regional conflict dividing the superpowers, the two 
countries are reportedly closer than ever to a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Baker insisted that the United States and Soviet Union had taken "concrete 
actions" and not just engaged in "simple rhetoric" on the Kuwait invasion, and 
both he and Shevardnadze said the superpowers would stay in contact about 
subsequent actions that might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
They also called on the Arab League, the Islamic Conference and individual Arab 
states to "take all possible steps" to obtain implementation of a U.N. Security 
Council resolution demanding that "Iraq withdraw immediately and 
unconditionally all its forces." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said there has not yet been any superpower contact with China to 
win its approval for an international arms boycott of Iraq. He said, however, 
that the Chinese would be approached. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze also warned that the maltreatment of their fellow 
citizens caught up in the hostilities could have dire repercussions. According 
to Baker, there are 3,800 American residents in Kuwait, and the Soviet foreign 
minister said that a "big Soviet colony" of 7,000 to 8,000 advisers and other 
personnel lives in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect the safety and welfare of Americans to be safeguarded, and there 
would be very severe consequences if that were not the case," Baker declared. 
Shevardnadze said basically the same thing about his countrymen in Iraq.

KUWAIT AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Geography: About size of New Jersey; in northeast corner of Arabian peninsula. 
Hot, dry and almost entirely desert; only 0.05% of territory is arable. Flat 
landscape relieved mainly by modern office buildings, apartment towers and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Economy: A founding member of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
Has one of world's largest oil reserves and one of highest per-capita incomes. 
But decline of oil market by 1982 left it selling less than one-fourth of oil 
it was shipping earlier. 
</P>
<P>
People: Less than half of 2 million population -- 41% -- is native Kuwaiti. 
Rest are mostly Palestinians, Indians, Pakistanis and Egyptians who have found 
work on every level, from government executives and doctors to laborers. Islam 
is official religion -- Sunni Muslims are dominant -- and Arabic the official 
language, but English is widely used. 
</P>
<P>
Government: Monarchy ruled by emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah. His family 
has dominated Kuwait since 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Recent history: British protectorate from 1899 until June 19, 1961. No sooner 
had Kuwait become independent than Baghdad claimed emirate as its own, saying 
it had been integral part of Iraq's Basra province under Ottoman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad massed troops on border but withdrew when Britain objected. British 
force was sent in, followed by Arab League force, and two years later Iraq 
recognized Kuwait's independence. 
</P>
<P>
But border dispute remained. Twice, in 1967 and 1973, Iraq occupied small areas 
of northern Kuwait. Despite history of hostility, Kuwait sided with Iraq in 
1980-88 war with Iran.

BREAKAWAY CHURCH SEEKS TO RECRUIT EX-ARCHBISHOP;

WOMAN IS URGED TO JOIN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONGREGATION.

The breakaway church of George Stallings on Friday said it is recruiting former 
Archbishop Eugene Marino, who was the highest-ranking black U.S. Roman Catholic 
until he resigned because of a relationship with a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic Church officials said this week that Marino resigned last month 
after the disclosure of his two-year relationship with a lay minister, Vicki R. 
Long. The church previously said that Marino left because of a health problem. 
</P>
<P>
Long, 27, who has filed a monetary claim against the archdiocese for an 
undisclosed amount, has refused to comment about the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Stallings, the priest who founded the African-American Catholic 
Congregation, said that Marino's resignation proves the "folly" of mandatory 
celibacy. He asked Marino to join his congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"Roman Catholics intuitively know that Archbishop Marino's dark night of the 
soul is not a personal failure but a failure . . . on the part of the Roman 
Catholic church to deal realistically with the issue that a call to ordained 
ministry is not synonymous with celibacy," Stallings said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his congregation "would welcome a dialogue with him about a 
collaborative ministry within a viable Catholic alternative to Rome." 
</P>
<P>
Stallings would like to install Marino as an archbishop of his new 
congregation's western diocese in Los Angeles or southern diocese in New 
Orleans, Stallings' spokesman, William Marshall Jr., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard McBrien, theology chairman at Notre Dame University, said that the 
Marino affair could have a harsh impact on black Catholics, who make up 2 
million of the 53 million American Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
"What I fear is that people are going to say, 'Well, he is black and . . . they 
have different sorts of urges and needs,' " McBrien said. "That's racism of the 
worst kind, but it will be an effort on the part of certain figures in the 
church to gloss it (Marino's resignation) over." 
</P>
<P>
Terrence Dosh, a married priest who runs a national support group for priests, 
echoed that fear. 
</P>
<P>
The incident will "hurt black Catholics in the sense that any leader of a group 
who falls, they're (the church hierarchy) ashamed about it," he said.

Burn victim David Opont, in his first interview since he was set afire by a 
neighborhood bully on March 7, said Friday that the biggest lesson he learned 
from his ordeal was "to say no to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on "CBS This Morning," Opont, dressed in a suit and bow tie, 
smiled but kept his answers short and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his biggest lesson since a 13-year-old foster child tied him 
up and set him on fire, Opont said, "I learned to say no to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said Opont's attacker, described by police as a neighborhood 
"bully," tried to get him to take drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Opont, who turned 12 the day after the youth set him on fire in the basement of 
an abandoned Brooklyn building, was treated at New York University-Cornell 
Medical Center and later was transferred to Jamaica Hospital for 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster said it was painful for him to walk at first, but he added that 
his skin grafts did not hurt, although they were "itchy." 
</P>
<P>
On the show, a videotaped message from former President Ronald Reagan was 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said: "David, we were pleased to be able to see you and I hope that our 
paths cross again one day in the not-too-distant future. Please know that 
you're still in our thoughts and prayers." 
</P>
<P>
Opont quickly responded, saying: "Thank you a lot."

Congress approved and sent to the White House today a bill temporarily 
increasing the national debt limit to $3.195 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved the bill, 247 to 172, and the Senate passed it by voice 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Department officials said the government will run out of borrowing 
authority in mid-August, while Congress is on vacation, unless the ceiling is 
increased from its current level, $3.123 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
The short-term boost of $72 billion approved by the House was estimated to be 
enough to carry the government through Oct. 2. Without approval of the 
extension, the government could not borrow more cash to pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
The government has never defaulted on its payments. If it did so, economists 
say interest rates would skyrocket.

AT LEAST 14 U.S. OIL WORKERS CAPTURED 
</P>

Charles Amos was supposed to call home to Harmony, Tex., Thursday night. But 
the call never came. Instead, the 59-year-old oil-drilling supervisor working 
on a rig in the northern Kuwaiti desert was swept up by invading Iraqi troops 
as they poured across the Iraq border that morning. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the blitz, which has left Kuwait under Iraqi military 
occupation, Amos remains one of approximately 3,800 Americans in the country 
whose fate remains largely unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies who employed some of the Americans are scrambling to locate them, 
and the State Department is pressing the Baghdad government for information, so 
far unsuccessfully. Officials said they understand that at least 14 American 
oil workers, including Amos, were captured by troops during the surge toward 
Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know who they are or what their condition is or where they are 
located," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said that the Iraqi government had assured them only 
that they would "safeguard the safety and welfare of American citizens in 
Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
So far, said department spokesman Richard Boucher, there have been "no reports 
of injuries or deaths to Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher added, "We cannot confirm that the missing Americans are in Iraqi 
control" but added, "We believe they are in Iraqi hands, and we want to get 
them back." 
</P>
<P>
Six of the Americans, including Amos, are employees of Santa Fe International 
Corp. of Alhambra, Calif., a drilling company owned by the Kuwaiti national 
petroleum company, Kuwait Oil. One Canadian and one British employee of the 
company are also missing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting some information from the drilling company and some from the 
U.S. State Department," said Amos' son David, who said no definitive word on 
his father has come yet. The elder Amos had been expected to head home to 
attend a family reunion this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Walterscheid, whose husband, Rainard, worked for Santa Fe's Rig No. 6 
near the Iraqi border, said the company called her home in Jacksboro, Tex., 
Thursday afternoon to tell her that her husband was also apparently captured by 
the invaders. 
</P>
<P>
"They said he was on the phone with them when the soldiers got there," 
Walterscheid said. "He told them, 'I have to go now. The soldiers are here.' " 
</P>
<P>
She said that when the company called back later, an Arab who answered the 
phone said that the soldiers had rounded up her husband and seven others and 
"taken them north." 
</P>
<P>
Walterscheid said she has been in frequent contact with the drilling company 
and the State Department but "they say they don't know much." 
</P>
<P>
Dresser Industries of Dallas reported that three of its employees in Kuwait 
were missing. "We were in touch with our people three times yesterday, but then 
we lost contact," said spokesman Herb Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Phone lines to Kuwait have been jammed since the invasion began, compounding 
fear and confusion among employers and family members. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to get back through to (to our employees) nor they to us 
since yesterday morning," said Doug E. Oliver, a spokesman for Lockheed 
Aeronautical Systems Co. in Marietta, Ga. Three of his company's workers are 
believed to be in a Kuwaiti hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies reported that they had managed to get their employees to safer 
locations. Texaco spokesman Anita Larson said the oil company, which operates a 
pumping and refining installation in the neutral zone between the Kuwaiti and 
Iraqi borders, evacuated about 800 American and non-American employees from the 
war zone.

ISRAEL CONCERNED ABOUT IRAQI MISSILES NEAR JORDAN'S BORDER 
</P>

<P>
A senior Israeli officer expressed deep concern Friday over new long-range 
missiles that Iraq has recently deployed near the Jordanian border. 
</P>
<P>
"They could use those missiles against civilian targets in Israel," warned the 
officer, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "This means that 
Iraq could hit targets in Israel without engaging our forces on the ground. 
What particularly concerns us is they have a 'non-conventional' capability for 
those surface-to-surface missiles." 
</P>
<P>
In the parlance used at the Israel Defense Forces headquarters, whose most 
prominent feature in central Tel Aviv is a skyscraper bristling with electronic 
antennas, "non-conventional" means chemical, biological and even nuclear 
warheads instead of ordinary explosives. Intelligence officers say Iraq 
possesses chemical weapons, including nerve gases, which they used during the 
1980s against the Kurdish minority and Iran during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the officer disclosed, Israel learned that the Iraqis were 
building what he called a "massive and intensive missile infrastructure" in the 
far west of Iraq, near the border with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The missile bases are at points that originally were pumping stations along the 
pipeline that ran from Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields through Jordan and into 
southern Lebanon's coast. Use of the line has been discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1973 Middle East War, Arab antagonists fired short-range, 
Soviet-made Frog missiles against Israel, but these did little damage. Since 
then, however, Iraq has received longer range, Soviet-produced Scud 
ground-to-ground missiles, which normally have a range of 300 kilometers (186 
miles). 
</P>
<P>
Although Israel may be a potential target for missiles from the new bases, the 
officer said: "I would think King Hussein (of Jordan) would be the one to be 
most frightened. Though he is now on good terms with (Iraqi President) Saddam 
Hussein, Kuwait was also Iraq's close ally, giving him $30 billion during the 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
"Syria also has good cause to be worried, since those missiles could easily hit 
Damascus," he added. Syria and Iraq are perhaps the most bitter rivals in the 
Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence sources believe Iraq's Hussein is striving toward a 
nuclear weapons capability to match that held, in the view of most analysts, by 
Israel. But a suspected Iraqi effort to build nuclear weapons was thwarted by a 
successful, long-range Israeli air strike in 1981 that destroyed an 
atomic-reactor complex near Baghdad.

INVASION COULD GIVE IRAQ KEY TO ENDING HOSTAGE CRISIS 
</P>

<P>
The Iraqi blitzkrieg of neighboring Kuwait, a crushing jolt to intra-Arab 
relations, could incidentally affect one of the Middle East's most agonizing 
dramas, the fate of the foreign hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
By seizing power in Kuwait city, the Iraqi military presumably fell heir to a 
number of Kuwaiti-held prisoners who are a key element of the hostage issue. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 prisoners are Shiite Muslim militants who were imprisoned in Kuwait for 
various terrorist acts including bomb attacks on the U.S. and French embassies 
in December, 1983. The six car bombings left six people dead and dozens 
wounded. The prisoners -- two others were released in February, 1989, after 
serving their five-year sentences -- are a mixture of nationalities, mostly 
Iraqi and Lebanese. At least one of the Lebanese is related to Lebanon's 
notorious Mughniyah clan. 
</P>
<P>
The Mughniyahs and another family, the Hamadis, form the core of the militant 
factions of Hezbollah (Party of God), the Lebanese Shiite organization held 
responsible by Western intelligence for the wave of kidnapings that began in 
Beirut in 1984. The demands of the kidnapers almost invariably called for the 
release of the Kuwaiti prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. officials said they had not been able to determine whether 
the Shiite prisoners are now under the control of Iraq and whether they have 
been taken to Baghdad. The officials said they are seeking information through 
several channels. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear that Iraqi control of the prisoners would improve their 
prospects of release and any consequent change in the stalemate over American 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
While Kuwait has turned aside all overtures to release or trade the prisoners, 
analysts said there seems to be little reason to believe that the Baghdad 
government would take a softer position. Iran, a non-Arab and Shiite nation, 
would welcome such a move. But Iraq remains hostile to Iran and has taken 
brutal steps to suppress the Shiite population within its own borders. 
</P>
<P>
Of a possible break in the deadlock over the American hostages, Estelle 
Ronneburg, mother of hostage Jesse Turner, expressed mixed feelings. "I'm 
hoping so, but I wouldn't want it to be at the expense of the people of 
Kuwait," she said in a telephone interview from her home in Boise, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cicippio, brother of hostage Joseph J. Cicippio, said from his home in 
Norristown, Pa., that he "had high hopes that something might break this month" 
but is not optimistic that this is the hoped-for development. 
</P>
<P>
The presumed fall of the prisoners into Iraqi hands comes on the heels of 
another significant development potentially affecting the foreign hostages in 
Lebanon, who include six Americans. A week ago, the French government freed a 
Lebanese guerrilla, Anis Naccache, who had been sentenced for killing two 
people in a failed attempt to assassinate former Iranian Prime Minister 
Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has long demanded freedom for Naccache, and his release 
was interpreted as a French move to break through the hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian leaders have influence with Hezbollah and were credited with helping 
win the release of American hostages Robert Polhill and Frank H. Reed in April. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the release of Naccache and the Iraqi control of the Kuwait 
prisoners might lead to additional hostage releases is uncertain, particularly 
in the case of the Kuwait 15. 
</P>
<P>
Would Iraq's Saddam Hussein free them, triggering movement on the hostage 
drama? Arguments can be made in either direction: 
</P>
<P>
In the tangled Lebanese equation, Iraq cast its lot with the Christian forces, 
sending arms to renegade Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun in last year's struggle with the 
occupying Syrian army in Lebanon. To do a favor for the anti-Aoun Hezbollah 
would make little political sense. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Iraq has maintained that it opposes hostage-taking -- although 
some political observers in Britain insist that the Iranian-born journalist 
Farzad Bazoft, who was executed by Iraq on spy charges while reporting for a 
British newspaper, was little more than an Iraqi hostage. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hussein might seek to cleanse his brutish reputation by 
releasing the prisoners and claiming credit for any resultant freeing of the 
foreign hostages in Beirut. He recently freed a British nurse who was jailed as 
an accomplice of Bazoft, ostensibly on a plea for clemency from Zambian 
President Kenneth D. Kaunda, who declared in turn that Hussein was a 
misunderstood man. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts of Hussein's actions, however, insist that his every move is carefully 
considered. And while the hostages remain an emotional issue, Hussein is now 
playing for major stakes in Arab power. Release of the Kuwait prisoners would 
likely be read as a cynical attempt to erase the stain of the invasion.

Iran has chided its Persian Gulf neighbors for ignoring its warnings about 
dealing with Iraq, its opponent in a bitter and bloody eight-year war. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and urged an 
immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry's statement, carried late Thursday by Tehran Radio and monitored 
in Nicosia, also warned that Iran considers the invasion a threat to regional 
"stability and security." 
</P>
<P>
The Arab states of the Persian Gulf backed Iraq with billions of dollars in its 
1980-88 war with Iran. Kuwait had been insisting on repayment of war debts, 
infuriating Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Iran said "recent developments are the consequence of past collaboration with 
the aggressor" and added that it had "repeatedly pointed out to the regional 
countries" the threat posed by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq War ended in a cease-fire in August, 1988, but no formal peace 
treaty has been signed. The two sides agreed this year to try face-to-face 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Iran said that as the main regional power, it could not "remain indifferent" to 
"any development that could endanger its national security." But it did not 
spell out what steps it might take in response to the invasion.

ECONOMY: THE FALLOUT FROM THE INVASION IS LIKELY TO BE ENORMOUS AND

<P>
Iraq's sudden invasion of oil- and cash-rich Kuwait gives new meaning to the 
term hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
By storming Kuwait this week, debt-ridden Iraq sought not only to advance an 
array of foreign policy and ideological interests but to escape a financial 
squeeze that was growing ever tighter around its neck. 
</P>
<P>
In the longer run, U.S. analysts warn, it may have settled an equally dangerous 
economic noose around the neck of United States and other energy-dependent 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a war for control of some of the world's most valuable resources," 
said Philip Verlerger, an energy specialist at the Institute for International 
Economics. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Mideast specialists say economic need was by no means the only 
motive for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's drive into Kuwait. Among other 
things, he has long harbored ambitions of succeeding the late Egyptian 
President Gamal Abdel Nasser as supreme leader of the Arab world, and -- as an 
implacable foe of Israel -- he has resented the relatively moderate policies of 
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the other sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But the economic fallout from the Iraqi invasion is likely to be enormous and 
long-lasting, both for Iraq and for many other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's eight-year Persian Gulf War against Iran left Hussein with a battered 
and impoverished populace and debts totaling $72 billion to $80 billion -- as 
well as with one of the larger military forces in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Only a vast increase in oil revenue could satisfy the pressing demands of his 
bankrupt nation. In a single day of lightning-fast military action, Hussein may 
have given himself just that. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the latest in a long line of Middle East wars suggests that 
the world is now on the brink of another oil shock similar to those that 
wreaked havoc in 1973 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
However, many energy analysts disagree, saying the real danger is not that oil 
prices may head sharply higher right away. Instead, they argue, the most 
serious threat from Iraq, assuming it does not sweep across Saudi Arabia too, 
actually lies four or five years down the road when the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries will be in a far better position to squeeze the 
industrial world's oil lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
"There are upward pressures on the price of oil, but I think that it will stay 
close to where it is now," said Charles Maxwell, senior energy strategist for 
C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Connolly, senior consultant for Cambridge Energy Associates in 
Cambridge, Mass., agrees: "It is not in (Hussein's) interest to try to raise 
prices any higher since he can now generate much greater revenues from the 
combined production of Iraq and Kuwait. But later in the decade, it could get 
much worse. What he has done is establish himself as the military and economic 
swing factor in the Middle East and signaled to OPEC who's in charge." 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks leading up to the invasion, Iraq first relied on threats to 
persuade Kuwait and other small Arab states to restrict production in an 
initially successful effort to drive up the depressed price of OPEC's oil to at 
least $21 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"Having reached an OPEC agreement with saber rattling, Iraq's invasion was a 
big surprise to many of us," conceded Cheryl J. Trench, executive vice 
president of the Petroleum Information Research Foundation in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, with one thrust, Iraq has nearly doubled its control of oil reserves -- to 
20% of the estimated world supply -- and laid claim to Kuwaiti global 
investments worth at least $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which showers annual oil profits of $4 billion to $6 billion on its 2 
million citizens, has long been a tempting target for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kuwait's huge oil earnings that have been invested abroad over the 
past two decades bring in at least another $6 billion a year, according to U.S. 
officials. Although much of that investment is theoretically set aside for 
future generations of Kuwaitis, similar promises in the business world have not 
necessarily prevented corporate raiders from tapping big pension surpluses to 
pay off the costs of acquiring their targets. 
</P>
<P>
Western powers, led by the United States, are seeking to deny Hussein these 
spoils of war by freezing Kuwait's assets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But many analysts argue that, short of military action on the part of the 
Western allies to topple Hussein, Iraq is unlikely to retreat from its apparent 
goals of bleeding Kuwait dry and, in the longer run, pushing up the price of 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
While Iraq's newly won power inside OPEC may not pose immediate economic 
dangers for the Western industrialized nations, there is little doubt that it 
promises to usher in a far more unstable era. 
</P>
<P>
"The West now faces a highly politicized OPEC dominated by a man who reminds me 
of Adolf Hitler," Verlerger said. "We could deal with the problem now, but I 
doubt we will. That means we'll have to deal with him later." 
</P>
<P>
For the present, analysts point out, supply-and-demand conditions favor the 
oil-consuming countries over producers. But not for long: If world demand 
continues to grow at the recent 1.5% rate from its present level of about 64 
million barrels a day, today's oil surplus could vanish within the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, non-OPEC countries such as Mexico, Britain and Norway have met 
much of the world's extra demand, boosting their output by roughly 1 million 
daily barrels each year. But that trend has been on the wane for four years, 
while the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer, appears to face an 
irreversible decline because of outdated technology and labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
That would leave OPEC, perhaps totally under Iraq's thumb if Saudi Arabia is 
intimidated by Hussein's military power, as the only source of additional 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States cannot tolerate the domination of the Persian Gulf by any 
one power hostile to Western interests," said Robert E. Hunter, a former 
National Security Council staff member and current Middle East senior fellow at 
Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the warning bell in the night," Hunter added, "and we will have 
ourselves to blame if we don't take the action we have to (to lessen U.S. 
dependence on OPEC oil) -- and take it now."

<P>
The race toward German unification took a surprise shortcut Friday when leaders 
of the two nations called joint elections for Oct. 14 in a bid to stave off 
devastating economic collapse in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"A dream is becoming reality," declared West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
vacationing in Austria, after his East German counterpart, Lothar de Maiziere, 
proposed an all-German vote nearly two months earlier than scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Such a vote would effectively seal German unification barely 11 months after 
the Berlin Wall opened, ending more than 40 years of bitter and bloody 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Both parliaments still must ratify the election date, which initially was set 
for Dec. 2. The two countries just finished drafting a treaty outlining the 
merger of their political and legal systems. The last major international 
hurdle was cleared last month when the Soviet Union agreed to NATO membership 
for a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere readily admitted that quicker reunification cannot instantly solve 
East Germany's deepening economic crisis, but he said the "political clarity" 
of a single government would reassure anxious citizens as well as investors. 
</P>
<P>
"The faster that happens, the better for the restructuring of existing 
companies, for new investment and therefore for the creation of new jobs," De 
Maiziere said. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in East Germany, and I know what people on the street think and feel," 
he said later in an interview on West German television, adding that "many do 
not trust" the current situation. 
</P>
<P>
Since plunging into the free-market system July 1, East Germany has been 
struggling with rising unemployment and bankruptcies despite massive cash 
infusions from Bonn. About 240,000 workers are unemployed while 330,000 work 
only part-time. An additional 90,000 East Germans who emigrated to West Germany 
this year are still looking for work there. 
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that East German unemployment could skyrocket into the 
millions, in a work force of 8 million, and that one-third to one-half of all 
enterprises in East Germany will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Factories unable to find Western partners are now saddled with the decrepit 
machinery, shoddy inventories and bloated work forces left behind by 40 years 
of Stalinist corruption and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Store shelves and show windows in East Germany are now chockablock with Western 
products, from candy bars to fur coats, leaving domestic goods largely 
untouched. Frustrated farmers now try to sell their produce from roadside 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kohl conceded Friday that East Germany's economic problems "were 
bigger than expected," he asserted that they can "be mastered" by a united 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Kohl and De Maiziere, who are both Christian Democrats, denounced 
the call for joint elections in just 71 days as political maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
"Kohl engineered a social catastrophe in East Germany," charged Horst Ehmke, a 
parliamentarian for the opposition Social Democrats in Bonn. "Now he's afraid 
of losing the voters' favor." 
</P>
<P>
The East German Social Democrats were meeting in special session to discuss 
quitting De Maiziere's grand coalition, which could leave him short of a 
majority in the 400-seat Volkskammer, or Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere suggested Oct. 14 because regional elections in East Germany's five 
states already are planned for that day. 
</P>
<P>
East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel complained that De Maiziere had 
consulted Kohl on Tuesday but informed his own coalition partners of the 
revised date only 30 minutes before publicly announcing it. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of infamous behavior destroys the ability to govern," Meckel said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier elections probably would allow Kohl to cash in on his popularity before 
the costs of repairing East Germany's crippled economy mount even higher and 
stir more concern among West German taxpayers already fretting about the price 
tag on reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has enjoyed a string of successes that have enhanced his image both at 
home and abroad, including his unexpectedly quick persuasion of Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to permit a united Germany to join the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization.

Negotiations on what to do with the Vietnamese boat people scattered around 
Asia have come to a stalemate, a U.N. official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are exactly at the same point -- I must be perfectly frank with you -- as 
in January," said Sergio Vieira de Mello, who has been coordinating the 
negotiations for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
But High Commissioner Thorvald Stoltenberg has not given up hope and will 
continue to seek a solution, Vieira de Mello told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Vietnam oppose forced repatriation of the refugees, but 
most other nations favor sending home those who are not considered to be 
persecuted but are seeking economic opportunity.

The advisory council to the National Endowment for the Arts voted 
overwhelmingly Friday to rescind a controversial requirement that artists 
certify that federally funded work they create will not be obscene -- a 
stricture that has precipitated a bitter, growing protest among artists and 
arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-2 vote calls for the reversal of a decision by NEA Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer to require the certification, which had prompted lawsuits by two 
major arts institutions challenging the constitutionality of the requirement 
and had led at least 10 artists and arts groups to reject NEA grants. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the 24-member National Council on the Arts is non-binding. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer -- visibly upset at the reversal by the council -- refused to 
discuss the vote but said he would act on the recommendation "in due course." 
</P>
<P>
The vote was taken at the beginning of the stormy first day of a scheduled 
three-day meeting at which the council is also scheduled to vote on new grants 
for two of four artists who were denied fellowships by Frohnmayer in June in an 
apparent attempt to appease critics in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
However, Frohnmayer ruled out of order a motion to hold debate over whether the 
fellowships should have been denied in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer disclosed that the arts endowment has opened formal appeal 
proceedings for the four rejected performance artists -- Karen Finley and Holly 
Hughes of New York; Tim Miller of Santa Monica, Calif., and John Fleck, of Los 
Angeles. A petition, signed by 50 arts groups, demanding favorable action on 
the appeal was delivered to the NEA earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to recommend elimination of the obscenity certification appeared to 
open the way for possible new conflict with Congress, however. Two key 
legislators made a rare appearance before the NEA board to discuss the degree 
of difficulty the NEA faces as it approaches votes in the House and Senate, 
expected in early September, on bills to renew and fund the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), chairman of a House subcommittee that produced 
legislation to renew the NEA, warned there is "no chance" of passing a bill to 
renew the endowment without restrictions on the kinds of art it can fund. 
</P>
<P>
Williams contended that continuing controversy over reining in the NEA's 
ability to support controversial and experimental art forms may provoke 
corporate and foundation arts funding sources to "abandon" the arts because 
they are unwilling to match endowment grants for fear of becoming targets of 
congressional rage. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), the ranking member of the House NEA appropriations 
subcommittee, told the arts council he will support an amendment to an NEA bill 
that would require the council and the endowment to ensure that grants are made 
only to projects that do not "denigrate the cultural heritage of the United 
States, its religious traditions or racial or ethnic groups" or involve 
"obscenity or indecency." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the prolonged national debate over whether to harshly regulate 
NEA-funded art has created a certain confrontation between competing political 
priorities: protecting artistic freedom and spending tax money on art projects 
some people find offensive or sacrilegious. 
</P>
<P>
"These two consideration," Williams said, "appear to be coming at each other, 
headlong, high speed, on the same track." 
</P>
<P>
While votes of the presidentially appointed National Council on the Arts are 
technically advisory, NEA chairmen have reversed council decisions on only 35 
occasions in the history of the NEA, and arts endowment observers said they 
believed it was inconceivable that Frohnmayer would reverse Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was taken at the first fully open session in the 25-year history of 
the NEA advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred after the obscenity certification requirement was condemned by 
council member Roy Goodman, a Republican New York state senator and close 
friend of President Bush. Goodman called it "a loyalty oath reminiscent of the 
McCarthy era" and denounced the climate of political controversy that has 
gripped the arts endowment for the last 16 months. The NEA, Goodman declared, 
has been the victim of "one of the most vicious smear campaigns in the history 
of legislative business." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said the national protest within the arts community had become so 
widespread that "it is not stretching one's imagination to say there will be 
tens, possibly hundreds," of additional grant rejections and individual artist 
protests.

HER HEALTH TOOK A LICKING, BUT MILLIE'S OK NOW

The all's-well was sounded at a White House press briefing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Millie's in good shape and back performing her functions as first dog," White 
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced. 
</P>
<P>
Millie's health did not exactly trigger shock waves in a day otherwise filled 
with them, from Wall Street to the Persian Gulf. But it did raise some 
questions after President Bush told a Colorado audience Thursday that Barbara 
Bush was in Maine with their grandchildren and "a sick dog." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bush told reporters that Millie was suffering from lead poisoning. "It's 
a terrible thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, Millie's ailment was downgraded from lead poisoning to "acute 
lead exposure, much less serious," said Jean Becker, a spokeswoman for Mrs. 
Bush. "In fact, the condition is basically already cleared up through the 
natural cleansing processes of the body." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said a veterinarian thinks that Millie's problem began when she 
walked through the solvent workers have been using to remove old paint from the 
south side of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"She then ingested the solvent, which caused this condition," he said, adding 
that the solvent has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said Millie's only symptom was lethargy, first noticed several months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She is still a little lethargic," Mrs. Bush told Becker on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Millie, who is "basically shy" and known to avoid crowds when she can get away 
with it, has an autobiography-of-sorts coming out Sept. 17. Titled "Millie's 
Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush," it was actually written by Mrs. Bush during 
her vacation in Kennebunkport, Me., a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Millie reportedly gives the inside scoop on a dog's life at the 
top.

<P>
MILITARY: LAWMAKERS SEIZE ON THE IRAQI INVASION TO SAVE THE VESSELS FROM 
MOTHBALLS. TWO OTHERS ARE TO BE DECOMMISSIONED AS PART OF THE DEFENSE BILL.

<P>
One day after using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to help save the high-tech B-2 
bomber, senators invoked the crisis again Friday to stave off the mothballing 
of two World War II-vintage battleships. 
</P>
<P>
During rancorous debate over whether to fund the ships in a $289-billion 
defense bill, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a former Navy fighter pilot, said it 
would be "incredible" if Congress moved "to dismantle the very equipment that 
will help us counter activities of a madman who threatens the economic 
structure of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Battleships, McCain declared admiringly, have "16-inch guns that hurl 
projectiles the size of Cadillacs 17 miles." 
</P>
<P>
In a spirited rejoinder, Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) said the shells of "the old 
rust buckets" actually were only "the size of Toyotas" and had missed their 
targets by half a mile in a bombardment of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Bumpers added, the Navy has silenced the ships' guns because it is 
"afraid they'll blow up" since the battleship Iowa explosion that killed 47 
sailors last year. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to steam into the Persian Gulf" to initiate military action 
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Bumpers shouted, "for God's sake do it 
with something that works." 
</P>
<P>
As requested by President Bush, the Senate bill calls for mothballing two of 
four battleships now in operation, saving $1.1 billion over five years. The two 
to be decommissioned are the Iowa and the New Jersey, leaving the Missouri and 
Wisconsin in service. 
</P>
<P>
Bumpers originally sought to sideline the other two also, but, to pick up votes 
for an amendment he offered, he reduced that to only one. He still lost, 55 to 
44. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators besides McCain argued that battleships -- which aided Pacific 
island campaigns in World War II and figured in Cold War maneuvers -- could 
play a valuable new role in responding to Third World flare-ups such as Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But some senators appeared to have political pork in mind as they opposed the 
Bumpers amendment. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said a new port for the 
Wisconsin in Corpus Christi was "95% completed" at a cost of $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is on the Gulf of Mexico, not far from a number of Third World countries in 
Central and South America," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
In pressing to finish the defense bill before going on its August recess, the 
Senate scuttled an attempt to allow military personnel stationed overseas to 
obtain abortions at military hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) withdrew the amendment after failing, on a 
58-41 roll call, to garner the 60 votes required to block a filibuster by 
anti-abortion senators. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth sought to overturn a 1988 Pentagon directive that prohibits abortions in 
overseas military hospitals even if the patient pays the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth said the policy is "discriminatory and grossly unfair" because it forces 
women to seek abortions at off-base facilities that are often inconvenient and 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), asserting it is "wrong for government to be 
involved in abortion," warned that Bush would veto the defense bill if it 
contained the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also voted 59 to 40 to kill a proposal to pull 80,000 troops out of 
Europe in coming months, instead of the 50,000 already called for in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) argued that the larger pullout was compelled by 
severe fiscal problems and by the dramatically reduced threat of an invasion of 
Western Europe. He said his amendment would save more than $1 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
"The West Germans are paying to keep Soviet troops in East Germany at the very 
time we are paying to keep our troops in West Germany to protect against Soviet 
troops in East Germany," Conrad said. "That makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), although 
acknowledging that troop levels in Europe should be dropped from the current 
311,000 to as little as 75,000 within five years, argued that most of the 
immediate cuts should result from talks with the Soviets on mutual reductions. 
</P>
<P>
One important reason, he said, is that any agreement will provide means of 
verifying that the pullouts actually take place. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate refused by a 67-32 vote to raise to 4.1% a 3.5% military pay 
increase in the bill. Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) said the change was needed to 
keep up with inflation. Over the last seven years, he said, inflation has 
outpaced military pay by 12.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment was rejected after Nunn read a letter from Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney warning that the extra pay increase probably would have to be financed 
by additional cuts in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected, 51 to 48, a move co-sponsored by California 
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson to use $100 million in unspent Defense Department 
funds for treating drug-addicted women and their children, known as "crack 
babies."

SEX REPORTS ON PRIEST CALLED CONFIRMED; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY: COVENANT HOUSE SAYS PROBE FOUND EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT BY FATHER 
RITTER, FOUNDER OF SHELTER FOR RUNAWAYS. HE HAS DENIED WRONGDOING.

<P>
Covenant House announced Friday that private investigators had found extensive 
evidence confirming sexual misconduct by Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of 
the nation's largest shelter system for young runaways. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, investigators hired by the Covenant House board questioned some 
financial dealings by Ritter, the charismatic priest who resigned in February 
as the organization's president. 
</P>
<P>
But there was "no evidence of any other financial impropriety or 
mismanagement," including the handling of hundreds of millions of dollars in 
contributions, the investigators said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
The Covenant House board said it was issuing the 51-page report in hopes of 
restoring the credibility of the church-affiliated organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, mistakes were made. Some corrective measures have been taken and 
others will be put in place," an investigation oversight committee said. 
</P>
<P>
"The report confirms some things that make us very sad," board Chairman Ralph 
A. Pfeiffer Jr. said. "We acknowledge (Ritter's) and our mistakes, and we 
pledge that we will do all in our power to ensure that they will not be 
repeated." 
</P>
<P>
The allegations arose in December, when Kevin Lee Kite, 26, a drifter from 
Texas, accused Ritter of luring him into a sexual relationship. Two other men 
made similar allegations, and charges of financial improprieties involving 
loans and contracts ensued. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter's Roman Catholic order, the Franciscans, investigated the sex charges 
and ordered him to leave Covenant House. The Manhattan district attorney 
investigated and found no criminality. 
</P>
<P>
The Covenant House founder has denied wrongdoing. The private investigators, 
Kroll Associates, said Ritter refused to speak with them, and Franciscan 
leaders agreed to discuss only limited areas. 
</P>
<P>
Kroll Associates said it interviewed five former residents who said they had 
sex with Ritter. One resident and four Covenant House workers reported sexual 
advances by Ritter, and another resident acknowledged having shared a bed with 
Ritter but denied sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter, 63, founded Covenant House in 1968. He reportedly is living in New 
Jersey and considering leaving the Franciscan order. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from his lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said the report "gives emphasis to 
an alleged few sporadic incidents, washing away more than 20 years of 
uncompromising and unstinting accomplishment."

MONTANA MUSEUM FINALLY WINS BIG PRIZE; 
</P>
<P>
DINOSAURS: AFTER YEARS OF LOSING FOSSILS TO OTHERS, A TREASURED TYRANNOSAURUS 
REX SKELETON WILL STAY IN THE STATE. THE BONES EXCITE EXPERTS AND TOURISTS.

Strangers have forever been coming to dig precious things out of Montana's 
ancient dirt -- sapphires, copper, fossils -- digging them up and carting them 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. This time the home team won. The trophy stays put. A museum 
right here, with exhibits that can run to barbed wire, frontier fashions and 
Rocky Mountain stargazing, has pulled off the grand slam, the Triple Crown, the 
Academy Award of saurian paleontology: the biggest, most complete Tyrannosaurus 
Rex skeleton ever found. 
</P>
<P>
It is a handsome textbook specimen, and "just about everybody would like to 
have it," Museum of the Rockies project coordinator Pat Leiggi said primly. 
"But it's ours." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy and Tom Wankel are the Montana ranching couple who turned up the skeleton 
on a bone-hunting outing in the Montana badlands some time back, unearthing a 
bit with a garden shovel and a jackknife. The first complete bone Kathy Wankel 
ever found turned out to be the first complete T-Rex arm anyone had ever found. 
</P>
<P>
When they somewhat diffidently drove it over to the Museum of the Rockies at 
Montana State University and found out what it was, "we wanted it to stay 
here," Kathy Wankel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of a sore spot that all these out-of-staters come and take 
the bones out and we get nothing for it," she said. "I'm a true Montanan. And 
we need some nice, clean tourist industry." 
</P>
<P>
Montana is a perfect boneyard of dinosaurs. Wherever else they lived, this was 
an excellent place for them to die, preserved in 65-million-years worth of clay 
soil. For decades, fossils have been dug up and carried off to big-name, 
big-bucks institutions. Six of the seven T-Rex skeletons ever found were found 
in Montana. This one, which the Wankel boys call Mr. T, is the first to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Leiggi doesn't begrudge that. In the past, no local institution could handle 
fossils the way the big out-of-state bone boys could. "For other museums and 
programs to take things out of the state seemed perfectly justified," Leiggi 
said. "But now we're part of this network," and "people are proud of the fact 
that not only is the dinosaur recognized as being from Montana but is staying 
in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
The paleontology department has gone from zero to bingo in a handful of years, 
thanks to renowned paleontologist John Horner, a Montana native who years ago 
went off to Princeton to work. He came back home to dig, but whatever treasures 
he found he took away with him. When some fellow Montanans called him a "grave 
robber," Leiggi says Horner answered: ' "When there's a job for me to come home 
to, I'll come back.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, he did, creating the first true paleontology department in the state. 
Horner's groundbreaking work in baby dinosaurs, in habitat and in nesting 
behavior, has helped to forge a world-class department. "There isn't anybody 
producing anything about dinosaurs who isn't calling us," Leiggi said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all its reputation among peers, the Museum of the Rockies does not 
exactly top the nation's vacation itineraries, like the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but wait. T-Rex was not even out of the ground and the public was wild to 
see this screaming tabloid of a dinosaur, the big megilla, with teeth like 
daggers and an appetite like a sawmill. It's like Leiggi says: You turn up a 
new duckbill, discover a colony of maiasaurs, and people say, that's nice. "The 
Wankels find a T-Rex, and the world gets excited overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight excitement takes time to satisfy. Leiggi will soon set up shop in the 
dinosaur hall, cleaning the T-Rex layer by layer in public view. Already they 
have learned much from this skeleton, nearly twice as complete as any other 
ever found. 
</P>
<P>
The arm upended common wisdom that the T-Rex's arms, the size of a man's, were 
vestigial at best. Project worker Matt Smith has studied its biomechanics and 
found that size is not necessarily function; those scrawny little arms, arms 
the T-Rex couldn't even see, could hang onto more than 400 pounds, 10 times 
what a man's can. 
</P>
<P>
The plaster and burlap-wrapped pieces arrived July 3 after 28 days of digging 
at a secret site. Even then word had leaked, and dinosaur buffs were begging to 
help excavate. "It's just me and my kid," they would plead, "and he's a good 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
Not a chance. The skeleton lay in an old stream bed, its back arched in rigor 
mortis. The team had to dig the bones free in separate blocks, like vast chunks 
of peat, tunneling and squirming beneath them to make sure they'd gotten 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
Hoisting the 6,500-pound pelvic block had everybody sweating. Had it fallen, 
someone working beneath it would have been killed, Leiggi said. 
</P>
<P>
And forget what the science-fiction movies show. In all of Earth's history, it 
would have been the only human being to be killed by a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

PITTSBURGH MAYOR VETOES BAN ON CIGARETTE MACHINES

<P>
Mayor Sophie Masloff, concerned about possible legal challenges, on Friday 
vetoed legislation that would have banned cigarette vending machines in most 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Masloff proposed legislation to make such machines operable only with 
tokens purchased by adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Without fairly balancing the needs of owners of publicly used commercial 
establishments with the need to protect the health of our children, this bill 
could only be implemented after serious delays," the mayor said in a letter to 
the council urging it to sustain her veto. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the vending machine ban, 7 to 1, last week. Its 
intent was to stop minors from being able to purchase cigarettes. The measure 
faced almost certain legal action from tobacco lobbying groups, vending 
companies and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the ban would hurt smaller grocery operations and possibly 
lead to an increased number of cigarette thefts from such stores. 
</P>
<P>
Masloff's legislation calls for modification of all cigarette vending machines 
to accept tokens and not currency. The only exception, as was the case in the 
vetoed legislation, would be in establishments licensed by the Pennsylvania 
Liquor Control Board, private clubs or work places not accessible to the 
general public.

IMPORTED BEETLE JOINS THE FRAY AGAINST ASH WHITEFLY INFESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists waging a biological war against the pesky ash whitefly have deployed 
a new soldier in the fight -- a tiny gold-and-brown beetle imported from 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Small swarms of the so-called ladybird beetles have been released over the last 
three weeks in Granada Hills, Gardena and Oceanside. Entomologists predict that 
the eighth-inch-long beetle -- which poses no threat to humans -- will reduce 
whitefly populations by eating juvenile flies that attach themselves to the 
underside of tree leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers said thousands of stingless, parasitic wasps released 
earlier this year to prey on the whitefly appear to be doing their job. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside entomologists do not yet have precise data on the wasps' 
effectiveness, but they have observed the predatory insect reproducing and 
attacking the pinhead-sized whitefly in five Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the results," entomologist Tim Paine said. A colleague, 
Tom Bellows, added that "the wasp appears to be a highly effective natural 
enemy" of the bothersome whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
First discovered in Van Nuys two years ago, the ash whitefly has spread rapidly 
throughout California, infesting 20 counties from the Mexican border north to 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The white-winged pest sucks the juice out of leaves and can defoliate entire 
trees. In the process, the bugs produce a sticky excretion that coats cars, 
patio furniture and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the insect has mostly bothered urban dwellers and nursery owners, 
munching on ornamental trees. But entomologists note that the fly is known to 
attack fruit trees, raising concerns about its threat to the state's 
agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
Imported by accident from Europe, Africa or Asia, the whitefly has no natural 
predators in California. Pesticides provide only temporary relief, with new 
swarms of whiteflies reinfesting trees shortly after they are sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, entomologists agreed that biological warfare was the only way to 
stop the pest. The speck-sized, stingless wasps were imported from Italy and 
Israel and are being mass-raised by the California Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Large releases of the wasps began earlier this year and were made in 18 cities 
in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange and San Diego counties. In 
recent weeks, researchers returned to the field to determine how their troops 
were faring. What they found was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The wasp attacks the whitefly by laying its eggs inside the whitefly nymph. 
Like a scene from a horror movie, the parasite's egg then develops into a wasp, 
which eats its whitefly host from the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
"In some of our research sites, if you pick up the leaves and look at the 
whitefly pupae, you'll see that tremendous numbers of them show evidence of a 
parasite emerging rather than an adult whitefly," Paine said. "The hole the 
whitefly makes when it comes out is very different than the hole the parasite 
makes, so we know when we've got success." 
</P>
<P>
Paine added that the observations were made in climates as different as the 
coast and the desert. 
</P>
<P>
The ladybird beetles were released over the last two weeks at three sites. 
Further beetle releases are planned as entomologists continue mass-rearing the 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said it will be sometime in the fall before researchers have a solid 
grasp of just how effective the predators have been in reducing the whitefly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the entomologists hope to import still more whitefly enemies -- 
another wasp from England that might be useful in the cooler climates of 
Northern California, and a parasitic fly from Israel.

A police officer has been suspended without pay for failing to help a homeless 
woman who was dying from exposure to the cold in December, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Raymond Ruczynski, 43, a 19-year veteran of the police force, was 
suspended this week for 10 days on the recommendation of the Police Board of 
Inquiry, police Capt. Richard DeLise said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly an hour after the officer reported to police headquarters on Dec. 16 
that the woman was drunk and had refused assistance, Mary Dennis, 59, was found 
frozen to death on a bench at a city bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Willie Williams said Ruczynski should have taken the woman 
to a hospital and consulted his supervisors. The Fraternal Order of Police was 
expected to appeal the suspension.

<TEXT>
<P>
First spotted in Van Nuys in 1988, the ash whitefly has spread north to 
Sacramento and south to the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
The pinhead-sized insect sucks the juice from the leaves of shade and 
ornamental trees, often defoliating them, and excretes a sticky sap that coats 
cars, patios and sidewalks. Pesticides are ineffective because of the 
whitefly's huge numbers, and the insect has no natural predators in California. 
So scientists have released two imported enemies -- a stingless wasp and a 
ladybird beetle -- to prey on the irksome pest.

GIRL, 14, FATALLY SHOT IN POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year old girl was fatally shot and her brother and boyfriend were 
seriously wounded in an apparent gang-related shooting when their car stopped 
for traffic signal in Pomona Friday evening, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Maryann Ayala was driving the auto and the two others were passengers when two 
to four other youths who had apparently followed them from from a convenience 
store pulled alongside in a car and started firing, Pomona Police Lt. Joe 
Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, her brother, Armando Ayala, 17, who was seated in the rear, and her 
boyfriend, Daniel Salazar, 18, who was in the passenger seat, all were hit in 
the left side, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication whether the girl or the other victims were 
gang members.

A Butte County judge contends he has no conflict of interest even though his 
wife is half owner of an alcohol-awareness school to which he sentences 
convicted drunk drivers. About 500 convicted drivers annually pay up to $845 to 
attend the Prevention Education Program Inc., the only school of its kind in 
the rural Northern California county. Court officials estimate that North Butte 
County Municipal Judge Darrell W. Stevens has sentenced 250 convicted drunk 
drivers to the school since he was appointed to the bench by Gov. George 
Deukmejian last year.

CAL STATE TRUSTEES HIKE STUDENT FEES 10% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the California State University system Friday increased most 
student fees 10% as a result of the tight state budget and warned that cutbacks 
in class schedules, library hours and maintenance at the 20 campuses are likely 
over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"It will result in considerable deterioration in the quality of programs," 
acting Chancellor Ellis E. McCune said of the impending austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State trustees said Friday that they had no choice but to follow state 
budget guidelines and raise annual student education fees 10%, to $708, for a 
full-time, in-state resident; that increase was double the amount previously 
planned. Tuition for out-of-staters was hiked $500, to $6,160. Cal State 
students who already have paid and registered for fall classes will be billed 
for the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The fee increases would raise about $16 million, the trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other sessions dealing with student fees, Friday's meeting in Long Beach 
produced no protests -- which observers attributed to the August timing, when 
campus activism is in a lull. Leaders of the Cal State Student Organization 
could not be reached for reaction. 
</P>
<P>
The specially empowered trustee committee also authorized $71.2 million in 
reductions to reach what is tentatively a $1.7-billion budget. In the largest 
single item, $23 million in lottery funds will be used for general operating 
expenses instead of, as previously planned, to purchase computers, pay stipends 
for guest scholars and artists, and fund a student community service internship 
program. In addition, administrative cost trims were ordered. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cal State officials said they fear the up to 3% in additional cuts the 
Deukmejian Administration can order in many state programs under the budget 
agreement reached earlier in the week. If fully implemented, reductions 
totaling $51.7 million will be spread among the 20 campuses, with layoffs of 
some part-time instructors anticipated and fewer courses offered. 
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, the overall Cal State budget was actually 2% higher than last 
year, but that increase is more than eaten up by inflation and contractual pay 
increases, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UC Board of Regents, facing similar circumstances on their nine 
campuses, may hold an emergency meeting later this month to raise undergraduate 
fees for California residents 10%, to $1,624, not including room, board or 
books; increase tuition 10.5%, to $8,040, for most out-of-state students, and 
hike fees for medical and law education 35%, to $2,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Kelly Bankhead, executive director of the University of California Student 
Assn., said she would argue against only the out-of-state and professional 
school increases. Although $2,000 a year is a bargain compared to the costs of 
private law and medical schools, Bankhead said, she fears that the increase 
will cause UC law and medical students to borrow more money and avoid 
community-service-oriented jobs.

'MAGLEV' FIRST PHASE COST PUT AT $1 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of a business consortium that proposes to build an 80-m.p.h. magnetic 
levitation rail line from Los Angeles International Airport to Palmdale said 
Friday that the first phase of the line, from the airport to Santa Clarita, 
would cost "a little in excess of $1 billion." 
</P>
<P>
The estimate, from John E. Chiaverini, senior vice president of the Perini 
Corp., represented a change from the consortium's refusal earlier to discuss 
the costs of the project, the first phase of which could be completed by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "maglev" line must first receive the approval of Caltrans, which 
is scheduled Sept. 14 to choose four of eight transportation projects proposed 
by private firms. The projects would receive gifts from the state of right of 
way, but all planning, construction and operating costs would be paid with 
private funds. 
</P>
<P>
The airport-to-Palmdale line is the only rail project among the eight proposed. 
All of the others involve highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
An outside expert had estimated this week that the rail line would cost in the 
neighborhood of $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Chiaverini said the consortium of Perini, the HSST Corp. and the Daniel, Mann, 
Johnson &amp; Mendenhall firm had not yet developed, in its detailed proposal 
to the state Department of Transportation, any estimate of what fares would be 
along the first phase through the West Side and the San Fernando Valley into 
the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But he said one part of the proposal suggests that some of the capital for the 
project could come from leasing or selling air space above the trains' 
guideway. It is expected that the guideway would be built mainly along the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has won the endorsement of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, whose 
press secretary, Bill Chandler, said Friday that the mayor is not worried that 
fares will be too high. Any private firm that hopes to make such a service pay 
for itself will have to keep fares low enough to attract large numbers of 
people, Chandler said.

AGENCY BRANDS AS FAILURE EFFORT TO START NEW COLONY OF OTTERS

<P>
An effort to establish a spinoff colony of California sea otters at San Nicolas 
Island 60 miles off the coast of Ventura has failed, the California Fish and 
Game Commission ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
No more sea otters may be captured and moved to the remote island, the 
commission ruled over the objections of federal wildlife biologists. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Friday set the stage for a possible dispute with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service over what to do next with the otters that remain at San 
Nicolas, although the initial reaction of federal officials was that they will 
not challenge the state's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to move sea otters from the Monterey area to San Nicolas began in 
1987 because of concerns that an oil spill near Monterey could wipe out the 
entire population of California sea otters. Wildlife officials first began to 
talk about the program in 1979 at a time when the sea otter population was 
declining. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 137 moved to the island, nine have been found dead of various causes, 
including one found at Point Mugu in 1987 shot and wrapped in chains; 30 have 
returned to their homes in Northern California, and 80 are missing and 
unaccounted for. Only 15 adults and three pups remain. 
</P>
<P>
The state did not rule Friday on whether the remaining otters must be 
recaptured and returned to the main population in the Monterey area. But Fish 
and Wildlife Service officials said they intend to keep the otters at San 
Nicolas Island, where federal biologists will continue monitoring their habits. 
</P>
<P>
The state's action came on a request by federal biologists to capture and move 
18 more animals to the island over the coming year, a proposal that was 
rejected. The federal officials planned to surgically implant radios in the 
chest cavities of the fur-bearing mammals to track their movements and study 
their behavior, federal biologists told the state commission. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the small number of otters remaining at San Nicolas, a Navy-owned 
island off the coast of Ventura, the San Nicolas otters are becoming a stable, 
reproducing colony, said biologist Galen Rathbun of the Piedras Blancas office 
of the wildlife service. 
</P>
<P>
But California Fish and Game Commissioner Albert C. Taucher called the effort 
"a complete flop." He also questioned whether the program to set up a colony at 
San Nicolas was necessary when the main population that ranges over 200 miles 
along the Northern California coast has increased by 25% since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That population, once driven nearly to extinction by hunters, has risen from 
1,300 to about 1,700, federal biologists agree. But the count this year shows 
the numbers are down 10% from 1989, Rathbun said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, at Taucher's urging, the commission voted to deny the federal 
permit to continue the 3-year-old program. 
</P>
<P>
"I still love the little otter and I think he is cute as hell, but as long as 
the population has gained 400, I will move for denial," Taucher said.

SCHUMAN'S DRIVING AMBITION; 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL GOLFER GOES THE DISTANCE AS TOP LONG-BALL HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of the practice range at Van Nuys Golf Course, at the 250-yard 
marker, a wire mesh fence towers more than 60 feet into the air, snatching a 
few hard-hit golf balls out of the air before they can sail out onto the golf 
course and whomp a golfer on the head. Two-thirds of the way up the fence, two 
workers standing in the bucket of a front-loading tractor are making repairs to 
the wire mesh. 
</P>
<P>
On most days, the men would be very safe. A golf ball hitting the fence on the 
fly would translate, after the roll, into a 300-yard drive, which is only a 
dream to all but a few golfers. The leading distance hitter on the PGA Tour at 
the moment is Tom Purtzer, with an average blast of 275.3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But on this day, as the two workers mend the fence, they unknowingly have what 
must be one of the most dangerous jobs in America. For at this moment, 250 
yards behind them, a man is slipping the wool headcover off his driver, a 
fearsome-looking club with a slate-gray steel head and a long, graphite and 
boron shaft. 
</P>
<P>
And as the fence menders work, Cary "Smoke" Schuman of Sherman Oaks, who has 
legitimately -- not off the rim of the Grand Canyon or across a glacier -- 
whacked a golf ball farther than any man in the world, is about to begin 
bombing practice. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the two men working 250 yards away and 40 feet off the ground, 
they are not in Schuman's range. Unless he took out a four-iron. But with the 
driver in his hands today, they have little to fear, because Schuman's accurate 
rockets are still rising as they buzz over the top of the 60-foot fence. 
</P>
<P>
So just how far can this 6-2, 215-pound, 37-year-old guy hit a golf ball? Well, 
no one really knows. He is, however, in the 1990 edition of the Guinness Book 
of World Records for mashing a golf ball -- at sea level on a flat course with 
only a very slight breeze at his back -- 411 yards, 34 1/4 inches in a 
PGA-sanctioned contest. He did that early in 1989 in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
And while that blast has helped Schuman in the wallet with lucrative 
sponsorship deals from Nike and other companies, it was not his longest drive 
ever. Maybe not even in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
He won the world long-drive championship a year earlier with a launch of 416 
yards. And a course marshal at the Van Nuys course was astounded one day 
several years ago when he watched a Schuman drive clear the 250-yard fence at 
the course, carry over two fairways and stop against a chain-link fence five 
feet from Vanowen Street. 
</P>
<P>
The distance from the practice tee where Schuman stood that day to the busy 
street where his ball stopped was just a shade under 500 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a pretty stiff wind that day," said Schuman, a scratch golfer. 
</P>
<P>
No amount of wind, however, could explain such shots. Neither could the special 
driver Schuman designed and uses, although it is to an average golf club what a 
Ferrari is to a mule. 
</P>
<P>
As a designer for the Pro Select golf company in Illinois, Schuman, with 
engineers' help, developed the CS411 (Cary Schuman, 411 yards) with distance in 
mind. And when Schuman added more than four inches to the normal 43 1/2-inch 
club shaft to create his custom long-driving weapon, he added about 10 or 15 
yards to his drives. 
</P>
<P>
Which means that with a normal club, a club available to any golfer, Schuman 
would only be capable of 400-yard drives. In a game where 240-yard tee shots 
are the norm, Schuman's blasts are freakish. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable distance comes from a combination of things, Schuman said. His 
size and strength are major factors. He can bench-press 300 pounds. But some 
golfers are surely bigger and stronger. The keys, Schuman said, are rhythm and 
timing, the ability to bring the clubhead speed to its maximum point at 
precisely the time it makes contact with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
And . . . well, some other factors. 
</P>
<P>
"I studied karate for a long time," said Schuman, who played golf at San 
Fernando Valley State College (now Cal State Northridge) for two years and then 
briefly at UCLA. "That taught me how to focus my thoughts, and that is largely 
what enables me to hit a ball so far. When you see a little man break a solid 
board with his hand in karate, that's focus, putting all your thoughts into 
that moment of sudden impact and having unwavering confidence that the board 
will break. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how I hit a golf ball." 
</P>
<P>
And with that force, often something did break. Before he helped design and 
build his current clubs, a shattered driver for Schuman was as common as smog 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke hardwood persimmon drivers and I broke a lot of metalwood drivers," he 
said. "During one six-month stretch about two years ago, I broke 49 drivers." 
</P>
<P>
He does not break drivers anymore. He does, however, break the spirits of any 
golfers who might have thought they hit a long ball. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at the Woodley Golf Course in Encino, on the par-five, 518-yard 13th 
hole, Schuman unloaded a blast that carried over the green, forcing him to chip 
back onto the putting surface. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked hard to get here," Schuman said. "I didn't always hit a ball this 
far. I worked hard to do this." 
</P>
<P>
In college he often was outdriven by opponents, he said, including USC's Craig 
Stadler. For a decade after college, he worked hard at being an actor and 
stuntman. He had a role for seven years on the hit television show "Happy 
Days." It wasn't until five years ago that he began a serious quest for golf 
distance. The karate helped, he said. So did an extensive swimming program, 
which he claims is the best exercise to build up the muscles used in golf. But 
mostly, it was dedication, the willingness to work long hours on a practice 
range, seeking just the right hip movement and shoulder turn that would produce 
the sharpest impact. 
</P>
<P>
Schuman, who also works as an account manager for the Ticor Title Insurance 
company in Van Nuys, has found it. 
</P>
<P>
A ball that leaves his clubhead seems to explode off the tee and pass the 
landing site of an average golfer's drive in a second. At that point, Schuman's 
drives are still boring into the air, still rising and seemingly picking up 
speed. When the ball eventually settles to the ground, the perspective is hard 
to come to grips with. Most golfers cannot even see a golf ball 400 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
For his talent and his efforts, Schuman is well-compensated. He estimates that 
he earns $200,000 a year from the golf business, from his job at Pro Select and 
his sponsorship deals and the fee he charges for demonstrations and clinics in 
the art of sending golf balls toward the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not money that excites him about the big-bang theory of golf. It is 
just the bang itself. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, while giving a clinic in Tokyo, Schuman sent ball after ball 
over a practice range fence 250 yards away. About 100 yards beyond the fence 
stood a shiny new office building. With many, many shiny windows. Some of the 
Japanese golfers at the clinic urged Schuman to go for the building. He 
politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, however, a man stepped forth from the crowd and made his way 
over to Schuman. Swing away, the man told Schuman. He owned the building. 
</P>
<P>
Schuman, ever the stuntman, obliged and promptly crashed three windows out of 
the man's beautiful building. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting a ball a long way for a golfer is an ego thing," Schuman said. "It's a 
rush of energy and adrenaline. Every time I catch one just right, it's the 
greatest feeling in the world." 
</P>

DEAD SQUID WASHED UP; 
</P>

ENVIRONMENT: THE WARM OCEAN CURRENTS AND STRONG SURF ALONG SOUTHERN ORANGE 
COUNTY'S SHORES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CREATURES' DRIFTING ASHORE, MARINE

<P>
Hundreds of squid carried by unusually warm currents and strong surf washed 
ashore Friday along some of southern Orange County's most popular surfing and 
sunbathing beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen little squid before, a few dead seals, but never anything like 
these," said Israel Paskowitz, 27, a champion surfer whose family runs a 
surfing school at San Onofre State Park. 
</P>
<P>
The pink and black animals, some as long as 3 feet and gooey to the touch, 
began washing ashore with the rising tide at San Onofre, Doheny State Park and 
Salt Creek Beach Park early Friday. About 100 squid were counted at Doheny, and 
the dead and dying creatures were strewn at 5-foot intervals along some 
stretches of San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologists say these squid are the offspring of a large South American 
variety known as "jumbo" or Humboldt squid that live off Peru, Chile and 
Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
In their natural habitat, adults can get up to 12 feet long, but in local 
waters they rarely reach more than 4 feet in length. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile squid drift north on warm currents from their home waters every 10 
to 20 years, said Eric Hochberg, a squid expert and curator of the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History. Sightings in Southern California have been 
recorded as far back as the 1860s. 
</P>
<P>
"They usually last a couple of years here but don't reproduce in these waters, 
so they die out," Hochberg said. 
</P>
<P>
What kills them, marine biologists say, is, in effect, their own appetites. 
They feed on sardines and will follow grunion to shore when the grunion come in 
to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll follow them ashore and get too close and get battered by the surf," 
Hochberg said. "Then they'll get sand in their body cavities, and one of those 
two things will kill them." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, squid were reported washing ashore at Ocean Beach in San Diego. 
But lifeguards at Orange County's southernmost beaches seemed to be finding the 
largest concentrations of baby jumbo squid. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the squids' arrival has been this summer's record high 
water temperatures, which were around 70 degrees Friday, said Fred Roberts, 
assistant curator of the UC Irvine Museum of Systematic Biology. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lack of a prevailing northwest wind and three storms in a row 
through June and July have left Southern California ocean waters resembling 
those found in the tropics, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are having a very early storm season this year and, without the wind to 
stir up the water, the temperatures can rise up into the 70s," Roberts said. 
"Warm water always brings in a different variety of organisms." 
</P>
<P>
Hochberg said the good news about the squid is that they are edible. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the type of squid you will see advertised as abalone-style squid or 
calamari steaks," Hochberg said. He cautioned, however, that any squid left too 
long in the sun should be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
At San Onofre, lifeguards were busy using their break time filleting portions 
of the baby squid. Shaun Healy, 23, a five-year lifeguard veteran, said he was 
planning a barbecue of epic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 60 pounds of ice on the way, and we're going to cut these guys up 
and stash them away," Healy said. "I've got at least 30 pounds already. Then 
we'll have a giant cookout on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SQUID FACTS 
</P>
<P>
Squids are mollusks, with soft, boneless bodies. They are found in oceans 
throughout the world and usually swim in large groups called shoals. 
</P>
<P>
They can change color rapidly. Squids do so mainly for protection, as a way of 
hiding from predators. The color range is from near white to orange, red, 
brown, gray and black. 
</P>
<P>
They have two fins on their tails and a head surrounded by 10 arms, two of 
which are longer than the others. Each arm has sucking discs for holding prey, 
usually small fish such as mackerel and herring. 
</P>
<P>
Squids range in size from less than 1 foot to nearly 40 feet in length, 
including arms. 
</P>
<P>
They swim with their fins. When greater speed is needed, squids suck water into 
a 
</P>
<P>
muscular tube under their heads. They pull the water into the walls of their 
body, then blow it back out the tube, which propels them. 
</P>
<P>
Squids are also equipped with an ink sac. When fleeing from an enemy, the squid 
spurts out its dark fluid, clouding the water around them so that they can 
escape. The fluid is harmless to people.

COURT OFFICIAL TO JOIN DRUG PROGRAM, AVOIDING A TRIAL

Robert K. Tuller Jr., who resigned as a court commissioner in Fullerton after 
he was caught with cocaine, won the chance Friday to avoid prosecution if he 
completes a rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Gary P. Ryan permitted Tuller to join a program in which 
first-time drug offenders have charges against them dismissed once they finish 
a court-ordered recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief court appearance by Tuller, Ryan told him that the one felony 
count of cocaine possession will be dismissed Feb. 8 -- as long as Tuller 
continues his once-a-week group therapy sessions at Fullerton's St. Jude 
Hospital and Rehabilitation Center and attends three sessions per week of 
Narcotics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Tuller, wearing a tie clip bearing a tiny figure of the scales of justice, 
declined to speak with reporters after the hearing. But his attorney, Lloyd L. 
Freeberg Jr., said Tuller believes that his arrest and subsequent enrollment in 
therapy, however painful, has made him "a better person in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
Tuller, 46, was arrested May 11 in an Anaheim hotel room after buying $100 in 
cocaine from a police informant. The informant had told police earlier that he 
had used cocaine with Tuller many times during the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Days after his arrest, Tuller enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program at the 
Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage. Soon after his release, he resigned from 
his job as commissioner of Municipal Court in Fullerton, a post to which the 
judges of that court appointed him in 1986. His colleagues said they never had 
a hint that he was a drug abuser. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl W. Armbrust argued against allowing Tuller into 
the so-called "diversion" program, saying that although Tuller meets the legal 
requirements, he is not a suitable candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem reasonable that a person who has graduated from snorting to 
freebasing is the type of person who should be allowed into the diversion 
program," Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Tuller had told the Probation Department that he had used 
cocaine just four or five times in the last year -- but that Tuller told police 
after his arrest that he had used the drug three times a month. 
</P>
<P>
Armbrust also noted a statement by Tuller in the police report in which he said 
he "got help once" for his drug problem but "went back to using again." 
</P>
<P>
That statement is a misquote, said Freeberg, who also said Tuller had never 
been in any other recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
What Tuller told the police was that he had tried to solve his drug problem on 
his own and had failed, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Armbrust said he is disappointed that Tuller was permitted 
into the diversion program, because he said Tuller ought to be prosecuted, at 
least in part because of the position of public trust that he held. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that attorneys and judges should be held to a higher standard than 
others," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuller is scheduled to return to court Feb. 8 for a determination on whether 
the charge will be dismissed.

AGENTS SEIZE PHYSICIAN'S PROPERTY IN DRUG INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: FILES, MEDICATION, VIALS AND SYRINGES ARE TAKEN AT DR. HARVEY 
LEONARD DANNIS' OFFICES IN ANAHEIM AND THE HOMES OF PATIENTS IN ORANGE, SAN 
BERNARDINO AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES.

State and federal agents raided homes and businesses in three counties this 
week as part of an investigation into alleged overprescribing of drugs by an 
Anaheim doctor whose license was suspended earlier this year on other 
violations, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The raids, from July 27 to Wednesday, took place at Dr. Harvey Leonard Dannis' 
offices in Anaheim and the homes of some of his patients in Orange, San 
Bernardino and San Diego counties. Patient files were seized, along with 
medication, vials, syringes and other items named in search warrants signed 
July 25 by North Orange County Municipal Judge Daniel T. Brice. 
</P>
<P>
In affidavits filed Friday in North Municipal Court in Fullerton, the 
orthopedic surgeon was accused of overprescribing anabolic steroids, Valium and 
other controlled substances to patients that included convicted criminals and 
known drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
One patient became addicted to drugs prescribed by Dannis, while two others 
suffered overdoses, the affidavits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Agents with the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement -- a division of the 
California Department of Justice, which is heading a 20-month investigation 
into the doctor's alleged activities -- plan to present evidence seized in the 
raids to the Orange County district attorney's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Dannis, who denied the accusations through his attorney, has not been charged 
and is free to continue his practice. 
</P>
<P>
State agents said in affidavits that they are also collecting evidence against 
13 of Dannis' patients on suspicion of obtaining narcotics and other controlled 
drugs by fraud, deceit and misrepresentation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients, agents said, were in the habit of "shopping" pharmacies 
so they would not arouse suspicion by buying all their drugs from one store. 
</P>
<P>
During their investigation, agents obtained statements from pharmacists in 
Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties, many of whom quit 
filling Dannis' prescriptions because they thought that he was overprescribing, 
the affidavits said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged violations by both Dannis and his patients fall under the state 
Health and Safety Code. The maximum penalty for each felony violation is a 
$20,000 fine or one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement spokeswoman Kati Corsaut, 24 
California physicians and dentists were arrested on suspicion of 
overprescribing drugs during 1988, the most recent period for which statistics 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
"We view the abuse of prescription drugs as a very major problem," Corsaut 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannis, 47, referred comment to his attorney, who denied all the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Dannis is totally perplexed by (allegations of overprescribing) and 
wonders what could they be talking about," Santa Ana attorney Michael F. Dow 
said. "When he does prescribe, he is very careful." 
</P>
<P>
Dow added that Dannis has complained that local pharmacies are constantly 
wanting him to give them more refill business. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said Dannis was upset because agents "did a lot of damage" when 
they raided his then-closed offices July 27. 
</P>
<P>
Dow said Dannis believes that the investigation was prompted in part by his 
enemies within the insurance industry, who do not like him because he has 
testified on behalf of plaintiffs in cases against insurers. 
</P>
<P>
"If the awards are substantial, that becomes an irritation to the insurance 
industry," Dow said. "He became something of a target." 
</P>
<P>
A 13-year practitioner in California, Dannis has long been under scrutiny by 
local law enforcement, authorities said. A 30-page affidavit filed by a Bureau 
of Narcotics Enforcement agent, Spring Robbins, outlined how Dannis first drew 
attention in 1985 when a former patient filed a complaint with the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration that Dannis administered excessive amounts of drugs 
and narcotics to him, resulting in a drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Dannis was charged with assaulting an Orange County 
marshal who had tried to serve a summons at Dannis' office, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, Dannis was again charged with assault, this time for 
punching a process server and her husband in their faces when they too tried to 
serve him with a summons, Robbins said in the affidavit. Both cases were 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, Dannis was indicted on federal fraud charges. Dannis billed 
the U.S. Department of Labor for medical treatments that he did not render to 
government agents who posed as Long Beach Naval Shipyard workers trying to 
obtain a doctor's excuse for being off work. 
</P>
<P>
While acquitted on felony charges, Dannis pleaded guilty in 1987 to one 
misdemeanor count of theft of government property and three misdemeanor counts 
of filing false statements to the government, court records showed. He was 
fined $32,000 and placed on probation for four years. In addition, the 
California Medical Board on Jan. 22 suspended his license for 90 days and 
placed Dannis on probation for 10 years, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
The current investigation began in January of last year, when Robbins met with 
investigators from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and state medical 
board to review complaints that had been filed against Dannis with the medical 
panel, accusing him of writing multiple prescriptions for the same medication 
on the same date to addicts. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators went to area pharmacists to document cases. Robbins said some 
"very suspicious" patterns emerged. Some patients were traveling from as far 
away as Victorville, Hesperia and Cardiff-by-the-Sea in San Diego County to get 
prescriptions from Dannis, Robbins said in her affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the specific cases documented by investigators and outlined in Robbins' 
affidavit: 
</P>
<P>
* A Garden Grove woman tried to kill herself in December by leaving the engine 
of her car running in a closed garage after becoming addicted to a hypnotic 
drug that Dannis allegedly prescribed for an injury suffered in an industrial 
accident. A second doctor who treated her determined that she needed nothing 
more than a daily regimen of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
* A Garden Grove man got on a bus and collapsed of a drug overdose last year 
while under the influence of barbiturates. Garden Grove police allegedly found 
in his pocket a prescription from Dannis for 100 pills of codeine. The man had 
a lengthy history of arrests for such charges as drug possession, petty theft 
and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
* A Cardiff-by-the-Sea man obtained about 3,500 dosages of Vicodin, a narcotic 
pain reliever, over 11 months beginning in September, 1988. The patient, who 
has a criminal history of possessing controlled substances, consumed the drug 
at the rate of about 25 doses a day and allegedly was getting his prescription 
refilled by Dannis every three to four days.

DISABLED TO GAIN FROM JOBS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Goodwill Industries of Orange County collects, cleans, repairs and 
sells discarded items, the agency's real commodity is jobs. For decades 
Goodwill has been providing job training and placement for disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwill officials say they do not encounter much discrimination from potential 
employers, but they are anticipating a greater interest in hiring the disabled 
as a result of the Americans With Disabilities Act signed into law by President 
George Bush last month. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark act prohibits discrimination in employment, public accommodations, 
transportation and telecommunications, and it requires that businesses with 
more than 25 employees be able to reasonably accommodate disabled workers 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen an outpouring of people calling, but some people have 
requested information," said Tino Rivera, one of several job developers who 
help program graduates with the nuts and bolts of finding a job. "Now that 
there's more of an openness about hiring disabled people, employers are 
starting to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Premo, executive director of the Dayle McIntosh Center for the Disabled, 
an Anaheim-based service and advocacy organization for the disabled, said she 
thinks the act will help both employers and disabled people seeking jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of disabled people really want to work," Premo said. "I think that 
employers will be pleasantly surprised by hiring domebody who wants to work." 
</P>
<P>
Employees and clients learning job skills at Goodwill's headquarters in Santa 
Ana sort giant bins of donated clothing and other items, make phone calls, type 
on word processors and assemble everything from airplane parts to 
heart-monitoring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably the most diverse job training program in Orange County," said 
Andrea Pronk, Goodwill's director of public relations. The agency places more 
than 100 people in jobs each year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While the unemployment rate is only about 3% in Orange County, it is 20% among 
disabled people who are willing and able to work, said Goodwill President 
George Kessinger. 
</P>
<P>
"People with disabilities are often underemployed," Kessinger said. "That is, 
they are doing jobs that require less skills than they have." 
</P>
<P>
At Goodwill, 50% of the 350 employees are disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Loenda Grover of Fullerton was hired to do clerical work at Goodwill after 
going through the job training program. Although Grover has a crisp, 
professional manner and adeptly juggles the agency's multiple phone lines, she 
said she thinks discrimination might have played a role in her rejection for 
positions at several other companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were discriminating. I don't think they knew what my problem 
was," said Grover, who has dyslexia, an impairment of the ability to read. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwill and others who work with the disabled say making workplace adjustments 
for them is often simple and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it is enough to install a new light in an office, build a wooden ramp 
or just lower a sign on a door, Pronk said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiring disabled people makes sense," Premo said. 'We've got to support them 
one way or another. . . . Currently federal and state governments pay $200 
million a year in California to support disabled people. . . . If you get the 
person a job and they're productive, they'll be able to pay part of their own 
support. And the person is doing something worthwhile by contributing." 
</P>
<P>
To find out what kind of changes might be required to accommodate someone with 
a particular disability, employers can call a toll-free database at (800) 
526-7234. SHANNON SANDS

ASBESTOS FORCES LIBRARY EVACUATION;

CONTAMINANT: THE SUBSTANCE WAS DETECTED JUST THREE DAYS AFTER THE SANTA ANA

<P>
About 60 employees and patrons were evacuated Thursday from Santa Ana's 
recently reopened Central Library after laboratory tests detected asbestos in a 
closed-off section of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old, marble-decorated library reopened Monday after two weeks of 
asbestos removal. 
</P>
<P>
Workers had barricaded the rear section of the building and removed floor 
tiles, which contained asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Library director Rob Richard said that air samples in the library showed no 
sign of asbestos. But further tests found asbestos in mastic, a glue that was 
originally used to set the library's tiles in place. The tile glue was not 
removed during the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said he decided to close the library about 5 p.m. as a "precautionary 
step." 
</P>
<P>
There was little chance of the asbestos getting into the air, because workers 
did not heat the glue or use any solvents to remove the tile from its setting, 
said city official Don Rose, who is in charge of handling occupational-hazard 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The closure was to eliminate any possible exposure to asbestos," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said that the library will remain closed for another week until the 
glue is removed. 
</P>
<P>
The 240,000-volume library is undergoing a $1.6-million renovation. The project 
includes a new children's wing, more bookshelves and a reorganization of book 
selections. A new main entrance will also be built at the south end of the 
library, which is now its rear wing. 
</P>
<P>
The library had previously been closed for about a month during the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The new asbestos problem will not delay the opening of the library's new 
children's wing in January, Richard said.

SOVIETS GET A FULL FINAL SAMPLING OF AMERICANA; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: ON THEIR LAST DAY IN THE SOUTHLAND, THE SAILORS TOOK IN THE RODEO AT 
CAMP PENDLETON, TALKED TO THE BOY SCOUTS AND WENT SHOPPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet sailors enjoying their last day in San Diego got a full dose of 
Americana Friday, bartering with Boy Scouts and U.S. Marines while watching a 
rodeo at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors, who leave for their home port of Vladivostok this morning, spent 
their last full day here watching the show, trading parts of their uniforms and 
taking pictures with U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, they saw a flight demonstration at Miramar Naval Air 
Station and shopped at the commissary. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, in the United States as the third in a series of reciprocal 
U.S.-U.S.S.R. naval visits, said they were surprised by how quickly the week 
went by and that they had just begun to understand how much there is to see in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Kokolov, a seaman on the destroyer Boyevoy, said through an interpreter 
that he had seen a rodeo on television in Moscow but that he did not entirely 
understand what the point is. "I understand it's a sport," said Kokolov, 20. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest differences between Americans and his countrymen, he said, 
is that "the people here are so talkative." 
</P>
<P>
Americans will chat about anything, he said. He also found them unreservedly 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who drove by on the road waved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While wild horses were kicking inside their pens, a U.S. Marine Corps honor 
guard paraded to the center of the rodeo grounds, hoisting the Soviet and U.S. 
flags. Servicemen from both countries saluted as each national anthem was 
played. In the stands, those in the all-white uniforms of the visitors were 
interspersed with the hosts in their camouflage fatigues. 
</P>
<P>
But many, rather than watch, hung around the fringes of the arena, exchanging 
gifts with the Marines and a group of Boy Scouts who had been invited to attend 
the closed event. 
</P>
<P>
What Americans wanted more than any other item was a T-shirt signed by one of 
the Soviet sailors; finding someone to explain what they had written was even 
tougher. Some wrote that they looked forward to seeing the sailors who plan to 
visit Vladivostok; others simply signed their names. 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviets found themselves puzzled by more than the meaning of rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans' frequent use of hand motions prompted many Soviet inquiries to 
the interpreters, said one, Gunnery Sgt. Kris Hankinson. 
</P>
<P>
On the base, many were perplexed by the Marines' use of the hand signal that 
means "I have a phone call for you" -- the thumb and pinky extended and the 
three other fingers curled to the palm. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, it is customary for three people to share a bottle of 
vodka, said Hankinson, and there, the "phone call" motion means "I want to 
drink vodka, and I need two others to join me." 
</P>
<P>
"They were wondering what was going on with all these officers," Hankinson 
said. "They were beginning to think they were all out looking to find people to 
drink vodka with." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his evaluation of San Diego food and San Diego women, Yevgeniy 
Finko, 21, said, "The food was good, and so was everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Finko, a seaman on the Boyevoy from the city of Frunze in the Soviet state of 
Kirghiz, added that the opinions and attitudes about the United States formed 
as he was growing up were quickly discarded during his visit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much been a total turnaround," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, when asked what they liked the most about their visit, the Soviets 
said they had liked many things and had not had enough chance to see them 
fully. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too little time," said Zgena Fomenko, 20, a seaman on the destroyer 
Admiral Vinogradov who hails from a small village on the Volga River. "We 
didn't have enough time to see all that there is to enjoy."

FISH CAMP, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four-wheel drive vehicle rocked and lurched as it wound its way up the 
steep, rutted mountain road. Hundred-foot pines, rooted along the canyon floor 
below, soared toward the wispy clouds. 
</P>
<P>
The mission was to find some of the most beautiful places to run in and around 
Yosemite National Park. But inside the car, a passenger glanced over the 
cliff's oh-so-close edge, wondering how long it would take -- seconds? minutes? 
-- for the Bronco to hit bottom once it teeter-tottered over the side and into 
the dizzying depths below. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the car screeched to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
"BLIMEY!" 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hawley, driver, running guide and owner of the nearby Yosemite Fish Camp 
Bed &amp; Breakfast Inn, suddenly began waving and pointing wildly at a lone, 
twisted pine growing out among several huge boulders on a distant hillside. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sight was intriguing at best, Hawley, a highly animated, slightly 
eccentric 48-year-old native of England, found it awe-inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you look at that!" Hawley shouted. "That tree is growing right out of 
the bloody rock! Oh blimey! How does it do that? It's magic! Bloody magic!" 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Hawley's attention shot to the car radio. Recognizing an opening 
riff, Hawley squealed, cranked the volume and punched his fist into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaaay! I love this song!" Hawley said, abandoning the steering wheel for a 
rollicking jam on his air guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, a sensational mountain panorama came into view. For a rare 
moment, Hawley was silent. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahhh . . ." he said softly. "This, this is magic." 
</P>
<P>
For Hawley, a former San Clemente resident and race director for Orange 
County's San Juan Trail 50-miler, "magic" is what he found 14 months ago when 
he came upon Fish Camp, a tiny mountain community on the southern edge of 
Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its location -- approximately two miles from Yosemite's South 
Entrance Station -- Fish Camp lies in the middle of distance runners' paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite itself has more than 800 miles of trails, most of which twist and roll 
through deep pockets of forest and along pristine meadows. But the adjacent 
Sierra National Forest, in which Fish Camp is located, also offers plenty in 
the way of runners' nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
"Now this," Hawley says as he leads a visitor up and along a beautiful 
pine-lined trail, "This is why I left Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hawley, a self-employed engineer, had been looking for a different 
line of work for the last few years. His specialty -- defense industry 
engineering -- was on the decline, so on a whim, he attended a bed and 
breakfast seminar at Saddleback College. He was encouraged by what he learned. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hawley, who often competes in races as long as 100 miles or 
more, was becoming increasingly dismayed at the congestion and development 
around his San Clemente home -- and all of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic, the millions of people were driving me . . . mad," Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Hawley was running in a 50-mile race in Sacramento with a friend 
who recently had moved to Coarsegold, a tiny town between Fresno and Yosemite. 
He told Hawley of a bed and breakfast for sale in Fish Camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Uh . . . where?' I mean, it could have been Tibet," Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
But he drove up, fell in love with the place and, for $250,000, bought it last 
June as a ready-for-business bed and breakfast establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"The second day I was making breakfast when I was approached by one of my 
guests, a very small, old New Zealand woman," Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'What are you trying to do there?' I said, 'Well, I'm scrambling 
eggs, Madam.' She said, 'No, you're not.' With such an abrupt statement, I 
thought well, maybe she's right. From that moment on, I did it her way." 
</P>
<P>
Few guests have to tell Hawley how to run his business anymore. Although his 
B&amp;B is not a mansion -- the rugged decor includes such items as a knee bone 
from a cow that rests on the fireplace hearth -- he does keep the three-bedroom 
guest house neat and clean, and serves a generous breakfast of fresh fruit, 
eggs and apple-walnut pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
But it's his wacky, hyper-paced personality mixed with his occasional crude 
English humor -- sort of Roger Rabbitt-meets-Monty Python -- that keeps his 
guests grinning. 
</P>
<P>
"Good morning guests!" Hawley shouted from the kitchen as he prepared breakfast 
last Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"OK!" he barked as he passed out bowls of fresh fruit. "What are you waiting 
for? Start eating!" 
</P>
<P>
Instantly, Hawley broke into an almost frightening loud laughter, a wildly 
cackling burst much like Dudley Moore did as a drunken Englishman in the movie 
"Arthur." Like many Englishmen named Barry, Hawley prefers to be called "Baz." 
Although some pronounce it boz, the correct way is baz. 
</P>
<P>
"You sort of have to be on Barry's wavelength to appreciate him," said Sandy 
Waddell, a longtime friend and running partner. "If that works out for you, 
there's a lot of chemistry. If you're not on his wavelength, well . . . You 
sort of love him or hate him sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not all Fish Camp residents (population 30, according to the 
road sign) seem to love Hawley. Although he describes himself as the "Mayor of 
Fish Camp" -- admitting that the title is a self-appointed one -- and often 
drives through town waving and shouting cheerfully to passersby, he hasn't 
quite made it on everyone's popularity chart. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Stanford, manager of the Yosemite Mountain Ranch, a private ranch of 
4,000 acres, said he caught Hawley trespassing on the ranch, and warned him to 
stay off. Hawley, he said, continued to trespass. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a go around about it," Stanford said. "He seems to think he can run 
anywhere he likes. He's done it three or four times, but I finally caught him. 
I told him to stay off the property, I told him it's private property. But he 
got pretty indignant about it. He didn't even have the courtesy to ask first." 
</P>
<P>
But most residents seem to enjoy his off-beat personality. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a really nice guy," said Wendy Davies, a checker at Fish Camp General 
Store. "I think he's crazy sometimes, though. He just jogs around everywhere in 
Fish Camp." 
</P>
<P>
And runs everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley, who in June organized and directed Fish Camp's first running race, the 
Shadow of the Giants 50K, has explored hundreds of miles of trails in the 
vicinity. Because of this, his worth as a trail guide is invaluable for his 
running guests, of which there are many. 
</P>
<P>
"What I found was that people like a guide when they run," said Hawley, who 
advertises in long-distance running magazines to further attract a running 
clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the runners that come up say, 'OK, where are we going to run 
today?' We can go run for four or five hours, and I can take them up in the 
hills and places they wouldn't find on their own." 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps only then, would they come to understand the meaning of the word 
magic. Barry Hawley style, that is.

BASKETBALL: FORMER LOYOLA MARYMOUNT GUARD IS BACK HOME TRYING TO IMPRESS THE 
NBA SCOUTS AT ROOKIE CAMP.

<P>
Jeff Fryer is buzzing through town again this week. 
</P>
<P>
But this time around he's pulling back the throttle so everyone can take a good 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer, the former Corona del Mar High School standout who was Coach Paul 
Westhead's "hired gun" at Loyola Marymount the past four years, is back at 
Loyola's Gersten Pavilion this week playing for the Houston Rockets in the 
Summer Pro League. 
</P>
<P>
He's one of hundreds of free agents -- former college standouts and drifters 
from the fringes of professional basketball -- trying to impress the scouts and 
coaches who have gathered at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer hopes to land a spot on Houston's roster. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 22.7 points per game at Loyola last season and set an NCAA record 
with 363 career three-pointers. He was one of 13 players invited by Houston to 
play in the summer league. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rockets and Coach Don Chaney are impressed, Fryer could find himself 
with an invitation to the team's veteran camp next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a new environment," Fryer said. "But I feel I'm competitive at 
this level, and hopefully I can earn a spot." 
</P>
<P>
Most former college players have to shift into a faster gear when they come 
into the Summer Pro League. But in order to catch on with the Rockets, Fryer is 
trying to back down from Westhead's version of the game -- in which the coach 
was upset when Fryer didn't shoot the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually having to slow my game down," Fryer said. "I can't shoot it every 
time I get my hands on it. I've got to feed it in to the big guys more often 
and be a little selective." 
</P>
<P>
He has adjusted quickly. With the Rockets, Fryer is running the same lanes -- 
with the guards often trailing the fastbreak -- as he did at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
But he's learning that he has to do more to play in the NBA -- like guarding 
bigger, quicker players. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more physical," Fryer said. "I'm having to play defense harder. At 
Loyola, our defense was real helter-skelter with all our shooting and driving. 
Here, all these guys were college all-stars, and they're tougher to guard." 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble, Fryer's teammate at Loyola, was the eighth pick in this year's draft 
when the Clippers selected him. Fryer was not drafted, but that doesn't mean he 
lacks pro qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer has a special kind of toughness. He showed it this spring in the way he 
and Loyola's players weathered the death of teammate Hank Gathers and then 
became the nation's darlings in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer set a tournament record against Michigan in a second-round game with 11 
three-pointers in 15 attempts. He burned the Wolverines with 41 points -- 
several of them from well beyond the pro three-point stripe, and many times 
shooting without a teammate or an opponent anywhere near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
And he's up to it again. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, in Houston's 128-112 summer league victory over the Boston 
Celtics, Fryer connected three times from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
The first came from a yard past the top of the stripe. The second time, Fryer 
got loose off a screen and unloaded from the wing over Mark Stephenson, the 
10th-leading scorer (27.2 ppg) in the nation last season at Duquesne. 
</P>
<P>
He capped it off by hitting a three-pointer over former UC Santa Barbara star 
Carrick DeHart. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Fryer scored 12 points in 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of guys who need playing time here, so I'm just trying to make 
the most of my opportunities," Fryer said. "I know I'm going to get the ball, 
and when I do, I've got to do what I do best." 
</P>
<P>
If Fryer winds up on an NBA roster, it will be because that team is in need of 
a raw shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Don DeJardin, Fryer's Pasadena-based agent, has arranged three rookie camps for 
his client. Fryer was in the Phoenix Suns' camp two weeks ago, but he and the 
team agreed to a mutual release so that Fryer could keep his commitment to the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
He also has tentative arrangements to join the Celtics' camp from Aug. 15-17. 
Things also might still work out with the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
One key to Fryer's fate may be held by Dave Jamerson, the Ohio University guard 
who set the NCAA record for three-pointers in a game this season with 13 but 
has yet to sign a contract with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer and Jamerson -- a first-round draft selection -- are similar players. At 
6-foot-5, Jamerson has a three-inch height edge on Fryer, but Fryer is a step 
quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'd go one-on-one if I get invited to veteran camp," said Fryer.

MCGWIRE SETS SIGHTS ON SNAPPING SLUMP;

BASEBALL: OAKLAND'S NOT-SO-BRASH BASH BROTHER HOMERS TO HELP ATHLETICS DEFEAT 
THE ANGELS, 8-6.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark McGwire's vision is imperfect. He looks out on the world -- and at 
incoming pitches -- through contact lenses of an unsettling brilliant green. 
</P>
<P>
But corrective lenses do not mean he does not have a good eye. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the fact that when he walked into Anaheim Stadium Friday, McGwire was 
batting .216 and in the clutches of a 1-for-19 slump, with eight strikeouts 
among those outs. 
</P>
<P>
The outs have kept coming -- strikeouts and groundouts, hard-hit balls that 
might have been hits. Everything but actual hits, and that includes walks, of 
which McGwire now has 68, third most in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people look at my strikeouts and don't think I have a very good eye," 
McGwire said. "I look at my walks, and they're in the 60s. I look at my 
strikeouts, and they're in the low 70s. You keep that even, that's a pretty 
good ratio. I have to have a good eye to walk as much as I do." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire went 0 for 3 Thursday night in Oakland's victory over the Angels -- and 
walked twice. He went 1 for 3 Friday in Oakland's 8-6 victory at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He walked once Friday. And broke through his slump with a hit in the eighth 
inning -- the kind of hit that is expected from one of the Bash Brothers. 
McGwire, the less brash, hit a solo homer to right-center, scoring the final 
Oakland run in a game they won after trailing, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire's homer, his 28th, combined with Dave Henderson's two-run homer to add 
a dose of power to a team that was without its main power source. Jose Canseco 
left the game in the early innings because he felt ill. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire is hitting in the low .200s in the next-to-last month of the season -- 
or the next-to-last month of most players' seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got two months left, and probably a pretty good chance of going to the 
championship series and World Series," he said. "It's not how you start, it's 
how you finish." 
</P>
<P>
He has hit .289, .260 and .231 in his three full major league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"People emphasize my average too much," he said. "How about my on-base 
percentage? How about my walks? My home runs? My RBIs?" 
</P>
<P>
His on-base percentage is not to be overlooked. It is .344, which does not 
touch Rickey Henderson's American League-leading .441. But it is nearly 130 
percentage points higher than his average, and that is a rare difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who you are," McGwire said, "some area of your game, people 
are gonna say things and write things about you. But hey, I'm a streaky 
hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Cold, and then hot. Before his recent slump he had hit in seven straight games, 
batting .346. 
</P>
<P>
He takes a big swing, and he undergoes big swings. 
</P>
<P>
The last big swing he took Friday sent a ball over the fence -- the eighth time 
he has homered in 21 career games in Anaheim Stadium -- bad eyes and all.

BLYLEVEN'S WIFE, 3 CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED AFTER ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four members of Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven's family remained hospitalized in 
Orange Friday with injuries resulting from a single-vehicle accident. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Blyleven's wife, Patricia, 37, was driving three of the 
couple's children on a southern Sierra Nevada highway when their truck flipped 
over Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The family was heading home from Reno, Nev., where they watched the eldest son, 
Todd, pitch in an amateur game. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Blyleven, 6, was ejected from the vehicle and suffered two broken arms. 
The group, including Blyleven's daughter Kimberly, 16, and son Timothy, 8, was 
taken about 37 miles to Southern Inyo Hospital. Timothy was treated and 
released, but it was later decided to hospitalize him for observation and 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
The four were transported by air ambulance to two hospitals in Orange, near the 
family's home in Villa Park. Mrs. Blyleven was admitted to St. Joseph Hospital. 
The children were admitted to Children's Hospital of Orange County. All were 
listed in stable condition, Tim Mead, Angels' director of public relations, 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bert called today," Mead said, "he wanted us to express his sincere 
thanks to members of the media and others for their concern and messages. He 
said, 'God really saved them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mead said Blyleven (8-7) will miss his start tonight against the Oakland 
Athletics so he can be with his family. No replacement had been named, but 
Sunday starter Chuck Finley will not be moved up in the rotation.

FUNDAMERICA CEO SAYS FOUNDER WAS PAID $5.4 MILLION 
</P>

The new chairman of beleaguered FundAmerica Inc. said Friday that a review of 
the firm's books revealed that company founder Robert T. Edwards was paid $5.4 
million thus far this year and mysteriously wired $11.3 million to two foreign 
entities. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Ruff, who was also named chief executive of FundAmerica earlier this 
week, said these payments and wire transfers raise serious questions about 
Edwards, who was charged two weeks ago with operating FundAmerica as an illegal 
pyramid scheme in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"To put it mildly, it blew me away," said Ruff about the company's payments to 
Edwards. "That's several times more than the CEOs in most Fortune 500 
companies" earn. 
</P>
<P>
The financial revelations came as an official of the California attorney 
general's office filed a statement in federal court alleging that FundAmerica 
operated an "illegal pyramid or endless chain scheme" in California, where the 
company is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The developments come a little more than two weeks after Florida officials 
arrested Edwards and charged him with running an illegal lottery. Florida 
officials allege that Edwards bilked $8.2 million from state residents. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who is free on a $1-million bond, has denied the charges, calling 
FundAmerica a legitimate multilevel marketing company. The company sells 
memberships for a fee in exchange for rebates on various goods and services. 
Representatives who sell memberships receive bonuses. The firm has about 
100,000 U.S. members. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff said Friday that Florida officials have told him that they will indict the 
corporation itself on criminal charges Thursday. Florida prosecutor Peter 
Antonacci confirmed Ruff's statement, although he would not discuss the 
specific charges. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not unexpected," Ruff said. "Other companies in network marketing 
have come under indictment and survived. It does not automatically mean the 
death and demise of FundAmerica." 
</P>
<P>
Ruff, who writes a nationally known investment newsletter, announced earlier 
this week that he and several unnamed associates intend to buy FundAmerica and 
try to save it from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff said in a meeting with supporters Tuesday that his first look at 
FundAmerica's books indicated that there had been no improprieties and that the 
company could be put on a sound footing. He seemed less certain Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I could PR you and say, 'No, no we are going to save this,' " Ruff said. "I 
honestly don't know." 
</P>
<P>
This came after he released a FundAmerica financial statement that purported to 
show that Edwards received a $1-million-a-month salary since May and took 
$316,821 in bonuses between January and June. The bonuses were paid to Edwards 
for his role in attracting new members, Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Edwards was paid $3.1 million in management fees, according to the 
FundAmerica statement. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, according to Ruff, personally wired $10.5 million of FundAmerica money 
to a Netherlands entity between October, 1989, and June of this year. Ruff said 
these were royality payments made to an unknown individual who helped Edwards 
with the idea of starting FundAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
"Some person unknown . . . was paid 12.5% of the gross receipts," Ruff said. 
Wire receipts released by FundAmerica showed that the money was transferred 
from a FundAmerica account at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles to Lloyds 
Bank in Holland. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff also said Edwards wired $827,049 to another entity in Hong Kong between 
Oct. 31, 1989, and May 23, 1990. Ruff said the money was interest owed to an 
unknown party who made a $4-million loan to FundAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards "went personally to the bank and wired these funds," Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Edwards began receiving a regular salary of $1 million a month shortly 
after payments to these entities stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was rather than have the payments go in this form, they would simply 
give him a $1-million-a-month salary," Ruff said. "I assume it was because he 
wanted at least some of the profits of these entities." 
</P>
<P>
The money wired to foreign countries and the salary paid to Edwards amounts to 
about $17 million, according to the FundAmerica financial statement provided by 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff said the company's directors were aware of at least some of the payments 
made to Edwards and the entities. 
</P>
<P>
Ruff said he has not spoken to Edwards about these payments: "I have no idea of 
the whereabouts of Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards made one call (earlier this week) 
to the company and asked to speak to me, and I chose not to speak to him." 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica is struggling to survive and is desperately in need of cash. The 
company has $17 million in assets, nearly all of which was frozen at the order 
of the federal judge presiding over a $150-million class-action lawsuit filed 
in San Francisco against FundAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
In a legal opinion filed in that case, Susan Henrichsen, California deputy 
attorney general, said Friday that FundAmerica's marketing plan emphasizes that 
participants can pay money for the chance to make even more money by recruiting 
people into the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The money earned by such participants is based principally on their recruits' 
purchases from the company, and not on sales" of a product or service, 
Henrichsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Henrichsen said California's FundAmerica inquiry is continuing. She said 
evidence shows that there were six to 10 times more memberships sold than there 
are actual members, a sign that memberships were sold over and over again 
without being used. She also said the company's controller submitted 
information saying that for a three-month period, bonuses paid for services 
were just $155,000, while the bonuses paid for recruiting totaled $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Henrichsen said a federal court order issued last week freezing FundAmerica's 
assets should be continued. She said the attorney general's office is not 
planning to file charges against FundAmerica at this point so other enforcement 
actions will not be duplicated, diluting the company's assets, which may be 
used for refunds.

MEXICAN FOLK MUSIC IS FAMILY TRADITION;

<P>
ECOS DE CHIAPAS PERFORMS SUNDAY AT THE FIESTA MARKETPLACE IN SANTA ANA.

<P>
There is no generation gap in the Cruz family. They have been working together 
since 1980, when grandfather Gilberto founded their folklorico group Ecos de 
Chiapas in the Mexican region of the same name. Gilberto was then 54 years old; 
the youngest member of the three-generation ensemble was 8. 
</P>
<P>
Today Ecos de Chiapas -- which performs Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. at the Fiesta 
Marketplace in Santa Ana -- is based in San Bernardino. Still under the 
direction of Gilberto, members now include sons Epigmenio (the manager), 
Ruisenor and Almibar; daughter Carmen; and grandchildren Veronica, Ivan and 
Abel. 
</P>
<P>
Elders within the family hierarchy teach younger family members the skills 
necessary to become well-versed musicians, particularly on the marimba -- a 
beautifully built instrument constructed of rosewood from their native Chiapas. 
Chiapans take great pride in traditional craftsmanship, calling the wood 
ormiguillo de marimba. The marimba forms the focal point of their folklorico 
arrangements -- which are passed among marimba groups -- with five or six 
players often playing it simultaneously. Though the entire Cruz family can read 
music, they are more likely to learn and perform their numbers by ear. 
</P>
<P>
But versatility on a single instrument is not considered sufficient. According 
to 18-year-old Veronica, who alternately answered questions herself and 
interpreted for her father, Epigmenio, during an interview this week, she and 
each relative involved sings and plays several other instruments. Any 
combination of French horn, flute, guitar, piano, organ and accordion may be 
used in a show, although Sunday afternoon the Cruzes will restrict themselves 
to marimba and electric bass, while Epigmenio and Ruisenor (whose name, 
appropriately, translates to "Nightingale") will lead the singing. Veronica 
will also dance. 
</P>
<P>
According to Epigmenio, the goal of the group is to share Mexican -- and 
particularly Chiapan -- culture in California and other states. Dedication, 
however, outstrips monetary rewards, for all of the men must support their 
families with work outside the group. Yet their commitment remains firm and 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
Performance venues usually reflect the grass-roots nature of the music -- 
public schools, universities (including several University of California 
campuses and the University of Redlands), markets, churches and private 
parties. Yet invitations that the group has received to appear in 
higher-profile surroundings -- such as at a party for former President Gerald 
R. Ford given in Palm Springs last year and attended by a host of White House 
officials -- underscores increasing recognition of the validity of folk-based 
artistic contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ecos de Chiapas occasionally joins forces with other folklorico and 
flamenco groups, on Sunday the ensemble will appear alone, presenting typical 
examples of regional music. Epigmenio pointed out that the marimba serves 
various traditions in different parts of the country -- folklorico dance music 
in southeastern Chiapas, Indian dances in other areas of the South, mariachi 
strains in Guadalajara and polkas in the North. The family performs in folk 
costume as well. Women appear resplendent in colorful, handmade dresses called 
chiapanecas, while men sport the blousy shirts and baggy pants of chamulas. 
</P>
<P>
Ecos de Chiapas will inaugurate the first annual Summer Fiesta at Santa Ana's 
downtown Fiesta Marketplace. Marketing director Florinda Mintz said she chose 
the group because she felt it represented "the most classical expression of the 
folk art." Six months ago, she tested Ecos de Chiapas before an "opportunity" 
audience, without advance publicity. "They were a complete success," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All concerts in the marketplace are free, funded by a budget amassed from a 
percentage of rent money from resident merchants. Moreover, since a popular 
three-day Cinco de Mayo festival this year attracted 15,000 attendants daily, 
potential sponsors have begun to surface. Mintz spoke optimistically of future 
programs that will both reach out to and enrich the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecos de Chiapas performs traditional music and dance of Chiapas, Mexico, on 
Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. at Fiesta Marketplace, 204 E. 4th St., Santa Ana. 
Admission: free. Information: (714) 550-0910.

SURF GUITAR CZAR DICK DALE STILL WEARS THE CROWN AROUND HERE; 
</P>
<P>
HE CAN BE UNEVEN, BUT HIS RAUCOUS PERFORMANCE AT THE COACH HOUSE THURSDAY 
PROVES HE'S STILL ONE OF ORANGE COUNTY'S TRUE MUSICAL GEMS.

Talking to Dick Dale can sometimes leave one with the impression that, along 
with creating surf music on the first day, the King of the Surf Guitar was also 
responsible for the rest of creation. But for all his proclamations of having 
taught Hendrix how to play, having single-handedly made the unknown sport of 
surfing a national craze, ad infinitum, it's doubtful that Dale seriously 
maintains any notions of deity. 
</P>
<P>
Performing as tremendously as he did at the Coach House on Thursday, though, he 
would be entirely justified in claiming the surf-god throne in any 
self-respecting Valhalla. From the reverberated froth issuing from his aged 
Fender equipment, Dale did indeed form a crashing universe of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Since Dale has been an Orange County staple for decades (he recently moved to 
the desert near Twentynine Palms but still performs here regularly), it's easy 
to take him for granted, particularly when some of his performances are 
godawful. As recently as a few months ago, he turned in a Coach House show that 
was so offhanded and full of dead air that it recalled the Reno-revue-like Dale 
shows of a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps playing surf guitar is rather like surfing: Either you're riding atop 
the wave or you're flailing around in the spume. On Thursday, Dale was in 
perfect form, bringing all the power and elemental fury to his guitar playing 
that made him a Southern California sensation 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Palpable might be the best word to describe his guitar work. From his 
machine-gun staccato picking and upside-down left-handed way of playing -- 
making the bass strings particularly handy -- to his super-heavy strings (too 
much for the "puny little fingers" of other players, he recently claimed), 
splashy reverb effects and loud, heavy-duty Fender Showman amps (essentially 
created for Dale's punishing attack), everything in Dale's arsenal aimed toward 
making an overwhelming sound that one could most definitely feel. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing inspiration from the sensation of catching a wave, Dale was a pioneer 
in expanding the vocabulary of the guitar, and his mastery of the instrument 
showed Thursday. Along with the incredible speed and precision of his picking 
(which literally causes his picks to melt), he used his amped-up Stratocaster 
to create amusical sounds -- deep, insane rumbles and high, keening wails 
somewhere between a police siren and a pterodactyl shriek. 
</P>
<P>
Dale performed with his "power trio" version of the Del-Tones, with longtime 
drummer Steve Aschoff and bassist Ron Eglit of Orange County's Gyromatics. The 
pair provided a muscular backing, with the alertness necessary to work with a 
leader who often lurched without notice from one song to another. Dale may have 
performed 29 selections; it was hard to tell with all the seamless segues. 
</P>
<P>
Dale had his long black hair pulled back in a ponytail, avoiding the 
unfortunate Morticia-meets-Uncle-Fester look he's affected at recent 
performances. An audience of old fans, as well as kids who weren't even born 
within 12 years of Dale's first Balboa twangings, crowded to dance in front of 
the stage as he pummelled through such Del-Tone classics as "The Wedge," "Death 
of a Gremmie," "The Long Ride," "Let's Go Trippin' " and "Miserlou." 
</P>
<P>
On the rocking "Jessie Pearl," he played with his fretting hand angled above 
the neck, like Jeff Healy's difficult technique. On that and his other vocal 
numbers, he displayed a rough voice that sounded like Barry McGuire on the 
morning after the "Eve of Destruction," but it got the job done. He also 
delivered some surprisingly hot tenor-sax honking on the R&amp;B oldie "Cherry 
Pie." 
</P>
<P>
Dale was born in Beirut, and there's a good deal of Middle Eastern influence 
mixed in with his California beach music. His speed picking is reminiscent of 
oud playing, and his most melodic playing, as on "The Victor," is based on 
Middle Eastern modalities. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Dale didn't work from a set list, and he wound up playing some 
numbers twice. They were worth the reprise: After offering a hot double-picked 
version of the Chantays' "Pipeline" early in the set, he repeated it near the 
end but played it with a ferocity, speed and power that even the most 
aggressive punk outfit couldn't have matched. 
</P>
<P>
Dale is a true phenomenon, one of the few Orange County can boast of, and he 
should be seen while he's still around. Like Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis, 
his performances can be uneven and unpredictable, but -- also like them -- he's 
an American originator, and there's no one else like him.

NEW DIRECTOR WANTS 'MY OWN STAMP' ON YOUTH THEATRE; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: JOE LAUDERDALE SEES NO 'MAJOR CHANGES' FOR LAGUNA CHILDREN'S PROGRAM, 
BUT HE HOPES TO ADD TO THE TROUPE'S FAME.

<P>
Joe Lauderdale, who is replacing Scott Davidson as the director of the Laguna 
Playhouse's Youth Theatre, is looking forward to making his own mark with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Lauderdale, 28, who has been associate director of the Youth Theatre for the 
last two years, said one reason he came to the company was the quality of the 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to continue that quality, which led in 1989 to the troupe being named 
best new children's theater company in the nation. "Of course, different people 
have different ideas," he said. "I don't foresee any major changes, but I plan 
to put my stamp on the company." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 Youth Theatre season will open Oct. 5 with a new adaptation of "The 
Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Katherine Schultz Miller. It will have "an ominous 
feeling," Lauderdale said, "an eerie kind of stark staging" and will remain 
true to the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Aladdin," a "colorful, sophisticated adaptation by Brian Kral" opening Feb. 
22, will be "all-encompassing, participation theater." 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse is in the process of obtaining rights for the remaining 
productions. Lauderdale hopes to present "Prodigy," a play by Mary Hall Surface 
about young Mozart and about "gifted children and their relationships with 
their parents." It would fill the April 12-21 slot. 
</P>
<P>
The last show of the season, and the only musical, would be "Bugsy Malone," 
tentatively scheduled to open June 14. 
</P>
<P>
Lauderdale, who received a master of fine arts degree in children's theater 
from Arizona State University, has headed the Playhouse's program for disabled 
actors, in addition to teaching and directing in the youth program. 
</P>
<P>
His "immediate challenge," he said, "is running the youth program by myself. 
I've learned a lot from Scott -- we worked well together. I plan to continue 
the growth of the Youth Theatre and make it even more well known than it is 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Davidson, and his wife, Jody Davidson, who had been the Playhouse's 
general manager, are leaving to open their own children's theater company at 
the Coronet Theatre in West Hollywood. Although they had little comment on the 
break, Davidson did refer to his frustration over youth theater productions 
taking a back seat to main-stage productions because of a space shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Stein, executive director at Laguna, said of the Davidsons: "We 
certainly wish them well and appreciate the work they have done here over the 
years." 
</P>
<P>
He said plans for a second facility for the youth theater had fallen through, 
but "we are involved in sensitive negotiations" for another site. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything materializes as planned, it will better suit the overall needs 
of the institution, as well as the specific needs we had hoped to address in 
the Youth Theatre program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said the playhouse is solidly behind continuing the youth program. "It's 
one of the greatest things going here and one that attracted me to come here as 
executive director in March," he said. "We're very proud of what they're doing 
artistically and pleased with the educational approach, which has elevated the 
program significantly over what it had been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
However, Stein said, "in a transition like this, it is appropriate to take a 
look at the program and re-evaluate it, get feedback from the participants, 
parents, board members and the staff and do some fine tuning." 
</P>
<P>
Stein said he, Laguna Playhouse artistic director Doug Rowe and the troupe's 
board members all believe that, under Lauderdale, "the youth program will equal 
or surpass its previous quality and success." 
</P>
<P>
"Lauderdale," he said, "clearly has the knowledge and the vision to take the 
program forward."

'SILK' PLANTS TAKING ROOT AS REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE

<P>
The Age of Aquarius turned me into a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
While my increasingly mellow friends were turning their apartments into 
one-bedroom jungles, hanging aggressively blooming plants everywhere there 
wasn't furniture (which was precisely everywhere), I was killing everything 
from Boston ferns to cacti. 
</P>
<P>
I would buy plants guaranteed to survive a nuclear winter. After four days in 
my care, they turned to parchment. I watered them, fed them, played Mozart to 
them, threatened them. They all croaked. I had a cement thumb. 
</P>
<P>
The solution was not plastic plants. In those days, an artificial fern looked 
less like a green plant than an opponent for Godzilla. Besides, you'd get the 
cold shoulder from the Earth Shoes crowd for being non-natural. 
</P>
<P>
But today, people like me have to look at the bigger issue, which is whether to 
enjoy the permanent beauty of the fake stuff and risk being unhip, or to enjoy 
the brief beauty of real house plants before you suffer the guilt pangs of 
knowing that you hastened their cruel deaths through sheer botanical 
incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, with today's ersatz house plants, you can avoid a good bit of the 
indecision simply because they look so great. In some cases, in fact, they 
almost look more real than the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
And they almost make Cindy Boothe look like a gardener. Boothe doesn't deal in 
fertilizer or water or potting soil or sunlight or shade. She doesn't tend 
plants, she assembles them. 
</P>
<P>
Boothe is the owner of A Silk Thumb, a small shop in Santa Ana dedicated to 
silk plants and flowers. In her shop and others like it around the county, the 
silk plants and flowers are all but undetectable as facsimiles from, say, four 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Are alarms going off? Are your natural budgetary defenses kicking in as you 
start recalling how much you paid for that silk blouse or raw silk sport coat? 
Relax. Silk in this case is mostly a generic term. Most "silk" plants and 
flowers are actually made from polyester or cotton blends, Boothe says. 
</P>
<P>
The growing popularity of silk plants, she says, has as much to do with the low 
maintenance associated with them as with their realistic appearance. You simply 
plunk them down on, say, a high shelf -- or in a windowless room where real 
plants would die or on top of a piece of furniture that might suffer water 
damage from an actual fern -- and forget them for a few weeks. And there they 
stay, in perpetual full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
When you think it's time to do a bit of dusting, you find a dry paintbrush, 
gather up a handful of cloth leaves, and simply brush them off. If you have a 
large artificial plant such as a ficus, you can take it out on the patio and 
literally hose it down. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the materials Boothe uses -- about 90%, she says -- come from the 
Orient. There are some U.S. companies that produce silk plants, but these are 
more expensive than their Asian counterparts. Some plants are made in Europe, 
but these too tend to be costly. A single flower from Holland, for example, may 
cost as much as $40, Boothe said. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, though, the stuff isn't cheap anywhere. One of Boothe's large floral 
arrangements is priced at $85, a good-size ficus goes for $180 and a fairly 
full-looking philodendron runs about $50. 
</P>
<P>
The main determinant of price, Boothe said, is how realistic the plant looks -- 
and therein lies a caveat emptor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a huge fluctuation in prices," Boothe said, "because in this business 
the same word doesn't necessarily mean the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, a silk ficus that goes for $40 at the local discount 
store may look as if it had suffered through a hard winter, and it may have a 
trunk that can quickly be spotted as fake. But a silk ficus on the market 
elsewhere for $150, with a real (albeit dead) trunk is going to look like a 
ficus, even up close. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve that lifelike quality, manufacturers use a process in which the 
cloth is printed in much the same way a T-shirt would be silk-screened. Leaves 
or flowers with variegated colors require multiple pressings, and different 
fabric blends and coatings are used to achieve various textures and finishes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Boothe said, some manufacturers are now using a process that 
involves imprinting an actual photographic image of a real leaf onto a cloth 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a real plant, a silk one can be made to your specifications. Want it to 
look bushier? Boothe will drill a few more holes in the trunk and attach more 
branches and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, custom orders or no, real plants are cheaper. But you have to leave them 
with the neighbors when you go on vacation, you have to water them and fuss 
over them and -- heaven help us -- talk to them. If you're lucky, they'll live 
and you'll get to feel like Luther Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
But listen up, all you murderers, and remember this: You can't kill a polyester 
fern. That ought to cheer you up if you have a bothersome conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, think of the fun you'll have watching the cat try to decide whether 
to eat it.

<TEXT>
<P>
Erik Madsen of North Tustin has a "Jack and the Beanstalk" story with a twist. 
The only difference between Madsen and Jack is that the hero of the fairy tale 
threw beans out his window. All Madsen did was clear a hillside of brush. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, I'd let one slope in our yard get kind of overgrown," Madsen 
admitted. "There were geraniums that had been growing there for years and a lot 
of branches and leaves as well. I also threw cut grass there. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally decided it was looking too wild so I decided to clear it," he 
recalled. So a few months ago, Madsen cleared the hillside of all the 
unattractive brush. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few weeks later, Madsen discovered a tall plant growing on the slope. 
Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be not a beanstalk but a sunflower -- 
one that eventually grew almost 15 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw it, I said, 'What's this?' " Madsen recalled. "Whenever the 
wind blew it would really sway, so I got a 6-foot stake and secured the flower. 
When it grew above the stake, I secured it to some nearby bushes." 
</P>
<P>
When the sunflower reached about 12 feet, it blossomed. At one time, almost a 
dozen flowers appeared. Finally, when it reached a height of about 15 feet, 
Madsen decided to cut it down. "It was starting to look kind of droopy," he 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Is it common for sunflowers to grow, seemingly out of nowhere, in Orange 
County? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is yes . . . and no. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunflowers are not native to this area," explained Rico Montenegro, assistant 
director of the Fullerton Arboretum, and the person responsible for the 
day-to-day operations of the facility. "However, you can find them. It's not 
that uncommon. Most likely this flower was germinated by a seed passing through 
a bird dropping. That would be a pretty typical way for a sunflower to be 
established in this area -- particularly if there were no other sunflowers 
around." 
</P>
<P>
But sunflowers aren't the only plants to be assisted by birds or such animals 
as ground squirrels. Anything from vegetables to flowers to cattails can be 
carried from place to place, according to Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
Madsen can second that. While he no longer has a giant sunflower growing on his 
back slope, he now has tomato plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tomatoes trying to grow in our rose garden too," Montenegro added. 
</P>
<P>
Although seed are carried by birds and animals, many plants are 
self-germinating. In Orange County, this is particularly common among native 
plants and wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first year, once they've been established, flowers that are native 
often continue to grown and spread," said Norm Van Ginkel, owner of the Loma 
Vista Nursery in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most common wildflowers in this region are the bright California 
poppy and the deep blue and purple lupine that often blanket the hills of 
Southern California, according to Van Ginkel. Both of these wildflowers are 
self-germinating. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite often, these flowers will continue to grow on their own with very little 
care required," added Van Ginkel. 
</P>
<P>
Because they require less maintenance and are more drought-resistant than some 
of their thirstier cousins, more Orange County residents should be adding them 
to their gardens. But are they? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," Van Ginkel said. "We haven't seen any noticeable increase from 
last year. Part of the problem may be that we don't consider many of our native 
plants to be too attractive. We've always sold California poppies and lupine 
because they produce colorful flowers -- but we haven't had that much interest 
in any other wildflowers. I guess they look too much like weeds to many folks." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the plants Van Ginkel sells are not native to this region of Southern 
California. Flowers don't necessarily have to be native to flourish in Southern 
California. Many perennials and other flowering plants can thrive and spread. 
Marigolds, the Mexican evening primrose (oenothera berlan dieri) and verbena 
grow well in our warm, dry climate, and are drought-tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
"Most folks have very definite ideas about what they want -- lots of greenery, 
perennials, colors. That may change in the future with more focus on water 
conservation and attempts to get people to plant native plants," Van Ginkel 
continued. "But for now, they still seem to prefer plants from other regions." 
</P>
<P>
Once gardeners have decided to "go native," they should expect wildflowers such 
as poppies and lupine to stay around for quite a while. Some species can even 
lie dormant for several years, according to Montenegro, only to emerge again 
when environmental conditions are more favorable. 
</P>
<P>
Could this possibly explain Erik Madsen's sunflower? And now his tomato plants? 
Could the former landowners have planted sunflowers or a vegetable garden? 
</P>
<P>
Not likely, since the Madsens have lived there for 20 years. 
</P>

"This has just been the craziest thing," Madsen admitted. "I don't know what 
will be growing out there a few weeks from now. It seems like every few weeks, 
something new pops up!" 
</P>
<P>
"While native flowers do grow well here, there are non-natives that can also be 
passed along and grow well, such as the sunflower," Van Ginkel explained. 
"Having a flower or plant suddenly spring up isn't that unusual -- just take a 
look at all the weeds!" 
</P>
<P>
If, like Madsen, you discover a wayward plant in your garden, bring it or a 
photo to the Fullerton Arboretum (Associated Road and Yorba Linda Boulevard on 
the Cal State Fullerton campus) or call (714) 773-3250. Van Ginkel and his 
staff at Loma Vista Nursery (650 East Bastanchury Road, Fullerton, (714) 
992-0270), will help identify it also.

IT DARES DESIGNERS TO TAME ITS MOODS

When we think of neon, it's usually in conjunction with Art Deco restaurants 
and nightclubs full of hard surfaces and brassy music. These days, however, 
lighting specialists are using neon to achieve an opposite end, to dramatically 
enhance discrete areas in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
Neon dares designers to be subtle. It is a light source that insists on 
claiming one's attention. It can easily overwhelm other design elements. Even 
in a large home, a bit of neon goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
"A house that would use neon would have to be contemporary, postmodern," says 
Tustin lighting designer and architect John Lomeli. "It doesn't lend itself to 
a classic, traditional house." 
</P>
<P>
While neon is being used in new ways, it remains more fashionable than 
functional. "Neon is nothing new; it's coming around for the second or third 
time," Lomeli says. "I think it came back because Art Deco came back." 
</P>
<P>
Designers face a challenge in taming its attention-grabbing nature, but neon 
seems to be going through a boomlet because it has a number of attractive 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"There are variables you have with neon that you don't have with fluorescent 
light," says Sam Barker, president of Sebco Distributing, a Santa Ana firm that 
specializes in low-voltage, energy-efficient and decorative lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Designers use neon to provide a soft reflected light around the roof line of a 
room, or to draw attention to a piece of art. Often, the neon itself is the 
artwork. "It's decorative lighting, not task lighting," Lomeli points out, 
adding that it is popular for use in coves because it gives depth and form to 
an architectural detail. 
</P>
<P>
Although neon isn't a light source to read by, it has several advantages over 
fluorescent light that make it highly effective in some situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Neon is a detached element. You can put it on the ceiling, on the walls, on 
the floor, because it doesn't have to do anything," Lomeli says. 
</P>
<P>
Neon is dimmable, and it comes in more than 50 colors, including eight shades 
of white. Neon tubes will also last for 2,000 to 50,000 hours, compared to 750 
hours for an average incandescent light bulb. 
</P>
<P>
Neon lighting uses a transformer at one end of the tube to excite the neon gas. 
The excited neon glows red. If argon and mercury are introduced into the tube, 
the light turns to shades of brilliant blue. Colored glass is also used to 
expand the range of colors available. Neon tubing comes in several diameters. 
The smaller tubing is used for architectural effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Neon is glamorous. Neon is fun," Lomeli says. "It creates, and it participates 
in, the illusion. Neon can be cold, it can be warm. It has a color palette that 
can create mood." 
</P>
<P>
Lomeli also calls neon "friendly," although he notes that not everyone will 
feel comfortable with it. He says that research indicates young people have a 
much greater tolerance for harsh lighting than do older people, and to many 
older people neon seems harsh. 
</P>
<P>
The neon light doesn't have to dominate the room, however, and in most cases it 
shouldn't. "You don't want the light to be the focus of the room," says Ralph 
Raya, chief executive officer at RWR Pascoe Engineering in Costa Mesa. "With 
lights, we're creating a contrast to enhance the architectural elements. When 
we are looking for pure architectural light, we go to neon." 
</P>
<P>
Barker has used neon to accent localized areas in Orange County homes. At a 
home in Emerald Bay with a skylight in the two-story entryway, Barker used neon 
set in a soffit to outline the skylight, creating a distinctive halo effect. 
</P>
<P>
At another home, the owners wanted to create the illusion that sunlight was 
coming through eight leaded glass panes. The area where the lighting had to be 
placed was difficult to reach, and Barker used neon because it requires less 
servicing than fluorescent lights. 
</P>
<P>
Neon also works well when the light is filtered through glass blocks. "It's 
like saying ham and eggs," Lomeli says. "Glass block is back for the third 
time." 
</P>
<P>
While neon can be more effective than other forms of lighting in certain 
situations, the reverse also holds true. On one lighting job, an architect 
wanted a lighted step up to a bathtub with a dramatic view of the Irvine 
valley. Originally he wanted neon behind the blocks. 
</P>
<P>
With that approach, Barker says, it would have been difficult to service the 
neon easily. Instead, he used incandescent grain-of-wheat bulbs in a flexible 
polycarbonate tube, and ran the tubing across the top of the blocks that curved 
around the base of the tub. 
</P>
<P>
The downside of neon has been its initial cost. Installing neon costs roughly 
twice what fluorescent does, Barker says. 
</P>
<P>
Raya says that depending on the project, neon can compete with fluorescent 
lighting on price. The space needed for installation of neon units is less than 
that for fluorescent light. And fluorescent lights are very expensive to dim. 
Over the long term, neon consumes less energy and requires less service. While 
fluorescent lights have a tungsten filament that eventually burns out, neon has 
no filament and will keep plugging indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the architectural restraints that influence neon's use, building code 
restrictions have kept neon from wider residential acceptance. For safety 
reasons, building codes currently limit voltage used in the home to a maximum 
of 1,000 volts. Extended lengths of neon require use of a number of small 
transformers. 
</P>
<P>
Technological improvements, however, are making neon more feasible for use in 
homes. New transformers are available that greatly reduce the voltage 
requirements. And modern units sense overheating problems and shut themselves 
off. When the glass in an older neon light broke, the traditional transformer 
wouldn't shut down and there was the risk of fire. 
</P>
<P>
The new units are also smaller and have better shielding. 
</P>
<P>
The new transformer technologies are so new that most existing codes don't yet 
recognize them, even if they're UL approved, Barker says. However, updated 
codes regarding neon are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
One consideration in using neon is the local availability of the tubing. Barker 
says neon tubing is fragile enough and often so intricately shaped that 
shipping it is risky business. As a further precaution, Raya says, "it's 
important that whoever manufacturers the tube be the one who installs it." 
</P>
<P>
Once in place, neon requires minimal maintenance. If a tube needs replacing, 
the quality of the light won't change with the new tube. "If you don't break 
the tube, it will last virtually forever," Raya says. The light output "will 
depreciate, but a new tube will (fall) in the same spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
Creating the tubing for neon lighting demands an artistic flair and a 
craftsman's skill. Rather than the assembly line uniformity of fluorescent 
tubes or incandescent bulbs, every neon tube seems to have its own distinctive 
shape. The swirls and curves of a neon design are imparted by glass blowers, 
and "there aren't enough (of these) glass benders around," Barker says. 
</P>
<P>
With the increasing interest in neon, further technological developments may 
extend its usefulness and reduce its cost. Sam Barker says that researchers are 
refining a low-voltage battery that will power a neon tube. He has already used 
a low-voltage neon system aboard a boat, to light an etched door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW DO NEON LIGHTS WORK 
</P>
<P>
Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert gas. The commercial applications for neon 
lighting were quickly recognized in the early 20th century. Today, neon tubing 
comes in several diameters and more than 50 colors. Neon tubes last for 
2,000-50,000 hours, compared to 750 hours for an average incandescent light 
bulb. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND ON NEON 
</P>
<P>
Neon gas was first discovered in 1898 by the British physical chemists Sir 
William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers, who named the gas after the Greek word 
meaning new. About that time physicists were experimenting with generating 
radiation by striking an area between electrodes in an evacuated tube 
containing only small amounts of vapor. In Paris in 1910, Georges Claude filled 
a tube with neon gas and found that when high voltage was applied to the two 
electrodes at each end, an electrical discharge occurred, which caused the tube 
to glow a deep red.

HOUSING UNIT GROWTH, 1980 TO 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the state Department of Finance, Orange County had a 21% increase 
in the number of housing units during the 1980s. But several cities' housing 
stock grew much more. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the list, Yorba Linda almost doubled the number of what the state 
calls housing units -- that is, year-round, vacant seasonal and/or migratory 
worker housing. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Yorba Linda, the big growth was predominantly a South County 
occurrence. Irvine, Tustin, Laguna Beach, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano 
all had percentage increases significantly higher than the countywide rate. 
Here are the city-to-city changes, listed from highest to lowest percentage:

Garlic Caused a Strike: The Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Plant and Garden News 
reports that garlic, which has proven to be an excellent companion planting to 
apple trees and other members of the rose family for warding off borers, may 
have caused the first strike in history. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic was a food staple of Egyptian slaves building the pyramids. Denied 
garlic, they refused to work. The reason for the garlic shortage isn't clear, 
but "perhaps it was due to its use on mummies." On March 30, 1989, the New York 
Times reported that a recently unearthed mummy sported a ring of garlic about 
the neck -- the assumption being that, as with apple trees, the garlic helped 
to ward off insects and so aided preservation.

CUTTING-EDGE WAYS TO KEEP UTENSILS IN SHARPEST CONDITION; 
</P>
<P>
MAINTENANCE: TO GET THE BEST SERVICE FROM KNIVES AND SCISSORS, THEY MUST BE 
TREATED WITH CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Because most basic cooking involves a good deal of cutting and chopping, good 
knives are a must in the kitchen. Sharp scissors -- in the kitchen and around 
the house -- are another necessity. 
</P>
<P>
To get the best service from knives and scissors, treat them with care and keep 
them sharp. Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
Knives: 
</P>
<P>
Use a knife only on a cutting board. 
</P>
<P>
Don't stir hot food with knives, since heat can damage them. 
</P>
<P>
Wash knives by hand right after using them and dry them thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Don't soak knives in water, since water can damage and loosen wooden handles. 
</P>
<P>
Store knives in a wooden knife block or with blades up on a wall-mounted 
magnetic rack. If you must store them in a drawer, use a divider or a knife 
rack to keep the blades from bumping against and nicking one another. 
</P>
<P>
Knives with serrated edges depend on notches for their cutting ability. They 
should be sharpened by professionals or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Before each use, sharpen non-serrated knives with a chef's steel: 
</P>
<P>
1. Grasp the steel in your left hand (if you're right-handed) and the knife in 
your right. 
</P>
<P>
2. Place the heel of the blade against the steel's tip, with the sharp edge of 
the blade meeting the steel at a 15- to 20-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
3. Applying light pressure, quickly draw the knife toward you and to the right 
so that the entire blade passes over the steel. 
</P>
<P>
4. Repeat the action with the blade beneath and at the same angle to the steel. 
Alternate strokes until each side of the blade has passed over (or under) the 
steel 10 to 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
To restore a badly dulled blade, use a whetstone (available at hardware stores) 
with coarse and fine sides. Before using it, saturate the stone with light 
mineral or vegetable oil. (Some stones must soak overnight; check package 
directions): 
</P>
<P>
1. With the stone coarse-side up and placed lengthwise in front of you, put the 
heel of the blade on the stone so that its sharp edge is at a 15- to 20-degree 
angle to the stone. Maintain this angle throughout the procedure. Applying 
pressure, draw the blade in an arc toward you and across the stone so that the 
entire length of the blade is sharpened. 
</P>
<P>
2. Flip the blade and reverse the stroke. Repeat 10 times on each side. 
</P>
<P>
3. Continue with a few light strokes over the fine side of the stone. Finish 
with a few strokes on the chef's steel. Wipe the whetstone clean and wrap it in 
a soft cloth for storage. 
</P>
<P>
Scissors: 
</P>
<P>
Sharpen scissors only if they are very dull. Frequent sharpening whittles away 
too much metal, causing the blade to cut poorly. Leave removal of deep nicks to 
a professional knife grinder. Before sharpening, tighten the pivot screw 
holding the blades together. If the pivot is a rivet, place the rivet head on a 
solid metal surface and firmly hit the other end with the ball end of a 
ball-peen hammer. If tightening the pivot improves cutting, there is no need to 
sharpen. 
</P>
<P>
1. Oil the coarse side of a whetstone as the manufacturer suggests. 
</P>
<P>
2. Open the scissors wide and, firmly holding one blade and handle, place the 
other blade on the fine side of the stone with the inner face vertical. Tilt 
the blade slightly, about 10 degrees, so that the cutting bevel is flat against 
the stone. Repeatedly move the blade diagonally across the stone toward you 
until you have the desired edge. Repeat on the other blade. It's not necessary 
to hone scissors' blades totally smooth. Scissors cut by breaking -- rather 
than slicing -- fibers. 
</P>
<P>
3. Wipe both blades clean with a soft cloth. Open and close the scissors 
several times to remove the accumulated metal that results from sharpening.

CONTROLLING INSECTS NEEDN'T AMOUNT TO CHEMICAL WARFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year about 20,000 people in this country are rushed to hospitals for 
pesticide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
According to Better Homes and Gardens magazine, pesticides have been linked to 
cancer, birth defects, respiratory ailments, neurological problems, liver and 
kidney damage and reproductive disorders. These chemicals bulldoze their way up 
the food chain, killing wildlife and polluting lakes, rivers and drinking 
water. 
</P>
<P>
People share the planet with insects, many of which are harmful. But keeping 
these critters at bay need not require chemical warfare. Here is a safer, less 
toxic approach to home pest control. 
</P>
<P>
The safest way to control bugs is preventive maintenance. The key is to think 
like a bug. 
</P>
<P>
Walk around the house and look for places where ants, roaches or rodents can 
enter. Caulk window and door trim. Keep composting piles, trash cans, firewood 
and other potential food and nesting sites away from the home. Keep debris out 
of gutters. Trim branches or bushes insects can use as a bridge to the house. 
Eliminate standing water under, inside or near the house. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining a healthy, vigorous lawn and garden will also discourage pests. 
Plants suffering from stress attract bugs. Use pest-resistant plants that are 
well suited for the climate. A mixture of two or more grass types is often 
heartier than a single mono-culture. Avoid thatch buildup, and use slow-release 
organic fertilizers that don't shock the lawn. Regularly check and maintain the 
lawn's pH. 
</P>
<P>
When some intervention is required, take the least toxic route. Organic, as 
opposed to commercial, pesticides are generally safer to use and less harmful 
to the environment. Although some natural pest controls like nicotine sulfate 
can be as toxic as chemical pesticides, most organic pesticides break down 
quickly in sunlight, or within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Organic controls use biological, botanical and mechanical methods. 
</P>
<P>
For a guidebook on pest control alternatives the "1990 Insect Pest Management 
for Home, Yard, and Garden" is available from the University of Illinois 
College of Agriculture, Cooperative Extension Publications Office, 69C Mumford 
Hall, 1301 West Gregory Drive, Urbana, Ill. 61801. Cost is $1. 
</P>
<P>
Two useful fact sheets, one on lawn care and one on gardening tips, can be 
ordered for $2 each from the National Coalition Against the Misuse of 
Pesticides, 530 7th St. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.

WAXING ENTHUSIASTIC OVER TUSSAUD'S ROCK 'N' ROLL CIRCUS; 
</P>
<P>
NOSTALGIA: OPENED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO IN LONDON, THE ROCK MUSEUM FEATURES 
ROBOTIC FIGURES OF ROCK STARS SCULPTED IN WAX. EACH EXHIBIT IS ACCOMPANIED BY 
MUSIC AND COMMENT.

<P>
A wax replica of Johnny Rotten is poised in a glass booth, hands gripping the 
silver stem of a microphone, its face twisted and contorted with a bit of 
spittle evident on the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Johnny Rotten," says a voice from overhead. "Look at him sneer at you. 
Look at him tell you your life is built on hypocrisy and lies." The unseen 
narrator reels off some facts about Rotten and his fellow Sex Pistols. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at him," the voice sneers, finally. "He doesn't like you at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the Rock Circus prepares visitors for the sting of learning that 
Rotten never liked them. But at least that is the only painful moment during a 
tour of the combination wax museum-robotics show-Rock Hall of Fame. That is, 
unless you consider it painful to watch a Bob Dylan robot in Ray-Bans strumming 
its way through "The Times They Are A-Changin'." 
</P>
<P>
Created by the Tussaud's Group, the same company behind Mme. Tussaud's 
Waxworks, Rock Circus features dozens of sculpted rock stars. Each figure is 
accompanied by a snatch of music and a dash of narrated comment. 
</P>
<P>
On an upper floor of the exhibit is a staged "animatronic" show that offers a 
Disneyesque view of rock history. Picture a Janis Joplin robot sitting on a 
park bench talking about the Summer of Love, singing "Me and Bobby McGee" and 
introducing a David Bowie robot. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of it certainly sounds kitschy. When credible musicians are displayed 
in such an overtly touristy way, one expects the result to be disappointing. 
Waxing nostalgic about rock 'n' roll is one thing. Turning rock 'n' roll 
nostalgia into wax is something else. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Rock Circus generally manages to stay interesting, if not compelling. 
The craftsmanship of the wax figures is extraordinary. And although the 
commentary accompanying each display will not enlighten anyone with a basic 
knowledge of pop history, it can be surprisingly acerbic for a tourist haunt. 
</P>
<P>
Opened less than a year ago in the historic London Pavillion at Piccadilly 
Circus, the $18-million rock 'n' roll display is probably the most grandiose 
tourist attraction ever devoted exclusively to pop music. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't without careful research that The Tussaud's Group decided there was a 
market for wax figures of Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin and Robert Plant. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which also draws visitors to its castle and amusement park, was 
looking for a new venture in the early 1980s. "Like all good businessmen, we 
decided to ask the public what interested them," says Martin King, general 
manager of Rock Circus. 
</P>
<P>
The company organized focus groups of Britons and foreigners -- Americans, 
Scandinavians, French, Australians and Germans -- and tossed ideas at them. The 
three main concepts Tussaud's was considering were an historical exhibit about 
London, the lives of the contemporary rich and famous and something they called 
"The Pop Experience." 
</P>
<P>
What the Tussaud's researchers discovered was unequivocal, says King. "The 
impression is that people come to England to learn about the kings and queens," 
he says. "But what we found is that they much preferred to see Elvis the King, 
and Freddy Mercury of Queen." 
</P>
<P>
The company is renowned for its wax figures, so the machinery already was in 
place to create a gallery of stationary rockers. But creating the "audio 
animatronic" figures -- the rock robots -- was daunting. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding which stars should be represented in the Rock Circus was left to King, 
Tussaud's executive Ian Hanson and rock writer Paul Gambaccini. "It's the 
ultimate party game," says King. He said the first 85% of the choices were 
obvious and easy. "The real areas of dispute were the final 15%." 
</P>
<P>
Rock enthusiasts will inevitably quibble at some of the choices. Americans may 
be baffled by the inclusion of Lonnie Donegan, the '50s British skiffle star 
who hit briefly in the United States with "Rock Island Line" and "Does Your 
Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor (on the Bedpost Overnight)?" 
</P>
<P>
And many people will be surprised to find there is not even a wax figure, let 
alone a robot, of Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the gamble to invest heavily in a rock 'n' roll attraction appears to 
be paying off. King estimates that up to 750,000 rock fans will see the exhibit 
this year -- a reasonably good showing by local standards. By comparison, 
Madame Tussaud's, the most popular tourist attraction in Great Britain, draws 
2.7 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Rock Circus has no trouble attracting attention to itself; figures of Jimi 
Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Elton John stand outside on the balcony facing 
Piccadilly Circus, looking down on the pedestrians like royalty. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, visitors are first sent over to have their picture taken with a 
sculpted David Bowie. "There's no obligation" to buy the photograph later, an 
employee repeats for each new arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone gets a headset, which is keyed by electronic doodads overhead to 
provide the appropriate narration and music for each exhibit. Then on to the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
In the main room, a rotating, circular stage shows a very '70s Elton John 
performing "Bennie and the Jets," Little Richard singing "Tutti Frutti" and 
Stevie Wonder with "I Just Called to Say I Love You." All of a sudden -- boom! 
-- Elvis Presly pops up from the center and sings "Glory Hallelujah." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the stars immortalized in wax posed for the Tussaud sculptors and 
donated personal items to make their display more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
Tussaud's sculptor Stuart Williamson was one of the artists involved in 
capturing Eric Clapton. The guitarist came to the Tussaud studio several times 
to pose with his guitar. At one point he played an old blues number for the 
artists. "It was like a private concert for us," says an appreciative 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
The sculptor went to Los Angeles to do Little Richard and to Frankfurt to get 
Sting, who was on tour. Johnny Rotten came into the Tussaud's studio several 
times and allowed the artists to make a cast of his rotten teeth. 
</P>
<P>
After a tour through the wax figures, visitors are sent to the grand finale, 
the robot show. The performance begins and ends with the theme from "Sergeant 
Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band," with Beatles replicas standing onstage 
looking like they were peeled from that album's cover. 
</P>
<P>
In between Beatle numbers, a Madonna robot sings "Like a Virgin," Bruce 
Springsteen does "Born in the U.S.A." and Bob Dylan plays "The Times They Are 
A-Changin'." 
</P>
<P>
The performance begs a question: Does the existence of a guitar-strumming Bob 
Dylan robot as a centerpiece to a multimillion dollar tourist attraction say 
something good, or something bad, about the evolution of rock 'n' roll? 
</P>
<P>
The show ends and the Rock Circus visitors are sent into a gift shop where they 
find pictures of themselves with David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
There's no obligation to buy one, but most of them do.

GIVING CHILDREN SKILLS TO STAY OUT OF GANGS 
</P>

<P>
"OK, let's have the fight," says Sister Anne Regan. 
</P>
<P>
Two 8-year-old boys start arguing. They go back and forth, getting nowhere 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
"You shut up." 
</P>
<P>
"No, you shut up." 
</P>
<P>
Regan, directing the role-playing, finally steps in. 
</P>
<P>
"Who can tell me the first step when I have a problem?" she asks the boys and 
girls seated around her in a semicircle. 
</P>
<P>
"You identify the problem," a girl answers. 
</P>
<P>
The fight -- and Regan's intervention -- is a small but integral part of Making 
the Right Connections, a six-week summer program at 10 South-Central Los 
Angeles Catholic parishes. The program, known as MTRC to its staff, aims to 
keep more than 800 young people between the ages of 7 and 14 from joining 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Identifying the problem in a dispute is the first of six steps for "fighting 
fair," part of a lesson in conflict resolution Regan is teaching to children at 
St. Francis X. Cabrini parish in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
The program is trying to tap into the same feeling of belonging and closeness 
that many gang members feel among their "homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that this desire, this need to connect is so great within us, that 
if we can't do it in a healthy, holistic, positive way, we're going to do it in 
a negative way," said Dan Drass, the program's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Drass said the program targets the younger brothers and sisters of gang 
members, who might be likely to follow in their older siblings' footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
"So we said, 'Hey, it's too hard to work with gang members,' " Drass said. 
"Let's get their younger brothers and sisters in a project and try to help 
build their self-esteem so that they can make a decision not to be involved in 
gangs." 
</P>
<P>
MTRC also hopes to reach other children identified as "high risk," who may not 
have a relative who is a gang member but live in neighborhoods with high levels 
of gang activity, and therefore high levels of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"When I lived in South-Central during the Watts riots there was violence, but 
it was violence with a purpose," said Sister Diane Smith, a Sister of St. 
Joseph of Carondelet, who with Drass founded Making the Right Connections last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I see a tremendous amount of violence, but it has no purpose. It's almost 
like genocide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The program runs five mornings a week and features social, cultural and 
academic activities based on the "Mission: SOAR" (Set Objectives, Achieve 
Results) curriculum developed by the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day, the children will participate in a game of dodgeball, make 
friendship bracelets out of colored strands of yarn, eat sloppy joes, listen to 
a guest speaker and have a lesson on conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Guest speakers provide the children with positive role models. Past visitors 
include representatives from the American Red Cross, Olympic gold-medal gymnast 
Peter Vidmar, and the UCLA University Express, a theater group that performs 
skits on the importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
The children also take field trips to introduce them to the world outside their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Parishes receive up to $20,000 each for the program and can accommodate as many 
as 100 children, although several have only 50 or 60. Drass said Making the 
Right Connection is supported this year by grants totaling almost $135,000 from 
11 foundations. He added that the program, although run in Catholic parishes, 
cannot be explicitly faith-based because it would be disqualified for many 
foundation grants. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, MTRC concentrates on activities that stress the positive 
connections in the community as a counterpoint to the tremendous pull gangs 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Medina, an MTRC teacher at St. Patrick's parish at the corner of Central 
and Jefferson, has experienced the pull firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
Medina, 22, grew up near St. Patrick's and was once associated with a gang. She 
had just entered seventh grade and was feeling lonely and unsure of herself 
when she became friends with a girl who was in a gang. She noticed that people 
in gangs were feared and respected. 
</P>
<P>
She took the name Cupid as her placaso, or gang name. She didn't last long, 
however. "You have to act tough, and I'm not that tough." 
</P>
<P>
Medina, who will graduate next year from Cal State Los Angeles with a degree in 
psychology and wants to go on to medical school, thinks the program is helpful 
for kids who are in the position she was in. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's going to have any long-term effects, but now, it makes 
them think a little bit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Drass pointed out that not everything in the program is specifically devoted to 
gang prevention. After the six-week session ends, each parish will continue to 
hold monthly gatherings to create an ongoing sense of community among the 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
As part of building the sense of community, the older children in the program 
are encouraged to pay special attention to the younger children. The point of 
the practice is not lost on Martin Garcia, 14, one of the oldest boys in the 
program at St. Patrick's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice, 'cause you can teach little kids what's right and what's wrong," he 
said. "That's why we talk to the little kids, and make them feel good, so they 
won't feel left out." 
</P>
<P>
Others directing gang prevention programs aimed at the same age group say 
programs like MTRC can have a positive influence. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe very strongly in these types of programs," said Steve Valdivia, 
director of Community Youth Gang Services, which runs a similar program.

BOSTON CHURCH KEEPS REVIVAL MOVEMENT LOW-KEY IN SOUTHLAND; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSY: BELIEFS OF BOSTON CHURCH OF CHRIST HAVE COME UNDER FIRE IN SOME 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE CHURCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Church of Christ has often been criticized for using authoritarian 
methods on its converts. 
</P>
<P>
But congregations started in Los Angeles and Orange counties a year ago have 
apparently been free of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sort of laid low here," said Marty Fuqua, who oversees about 20 
congregations the church has started in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
Fuqua acknowledged that the church has been subject to criticism elsewhere and 
that it has been banned or restricted on college and university campuses such 
as Boston University, Northeastern, Vanderbilt and Marquette. "As with any 
revival movement, there is a sense of unrest by those who don't want to be 
revived," Fuqua said. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of existence, church officials say membership has reached 25,000 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The beliefs of the Boston Church of Christ resemble those of conventional 
evangelical Protestant denominations, but its practices emphasize intense 
teacher-disciple relations that limit members' personal freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
College campuses have been a major focus of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"The movement seems to treat the university as its fishing pond," but then 
converts tend to abandon their studies and become alienated from their 
families, said the Rev. Giles Asbury, the Episcopal chaplain at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Campus ministers at a regional meeting last spring discussed the movement's 
alleged "cultic methods" and "subterfuge." However, Lutheran chaplain Will 
Barnett at USC said the church has "not been active at USC in any way that is 
obvious or open." Asbury said UCLA has had few calls from worried parents. 
Roger Lamb, a church spokesman in Boston, attributed the problems at some U.S. 
colleges to the "closed community" nature of campuses and to chaplains who feel 
threatened. The church seeks converts on campuses, Long said, because "young 
people generally are a little more idealistic and looking for something to give 
their lives to." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Church of Christ began officially 12 months ago, bringing its 
Bible study groups together for Sunday services at the Wiltern Theater. The Los 
Angeles church has grown to 575 members. 
</P>
<P>
The movement first came to California with pioneer congregations in San Diego 
and San Francisco. San Diego leaders launched an Orange County congregation 
last September, with 622 members at the first service and a large start-up 
collection of $74,600 in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the organization's first West Coast Discipleship Conference 
opened at the Anaheim Convention Center, with an expected turnout of 3,500 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to address the meeting tonight is Kip McKean, the evangelist who in 
1979 transformed a 100-member Church of Christ in the Boston area into a 
booming congregation worshiping on Sundays in Boston Garden, home of 
basketball's Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
McKean, still preeminent as the movement's leader, moved to Los Angeles early 
this year to help the long-planned congregation get started. He was unavailable 
for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, editor of the movement's quarterly Discipleship Magazine, said McKean 
took charge of the Los Angeles church after problems developed in the marriage 
of the couple that had been running operations here. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Lamb said, the West Coast is a "good base for getting to Asia." 
</P>
<P>
Recent issues of Discipleship Magazine reflect the strong spiritual authority 
held by McKean and the thinking behind "disciplining" policies that have 
disturbed some outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting unnamed critics' charges that the church is "blindly following Kip 
McKean," evangelist Steve Johnson wrote that he is following the founder with 
eyes wide open. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm just not as strong as some folks and I need help in following 
Jesus," Johnson continued. 
</P>
<P>
Another article by Johnson claimed that the Bible points to the "mentor-protege 
relationships" used in the church, but he added that groups of disciples should 
always aim to be "a family functioning together" in which the leaders must 
settle "for nothing less than totally united hearts and minds." 
</P>
<P>
Group sessions may become rough, Johnson said, because "personal sins will be 
exposed, confessed and dealt with." Some will be "on the hot seat, under the 
gun, so to speak," he said. After allowing no feelings to be hidden, the 
sessions should end on positive notes, Johnson advised. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that members are forced to be totally dependent on the group's 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network said that it receives about as many 
troubled telephone inquiries each month regarding the Boston Church of Christ 
affiliates as they do about Scientology and the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's 
Unification Church. Last May, 32 out of 365 calls on specific religious groups 
were about the Boston-based movement -- tops among all groups for that month, 
according to Cynthia S. Kisser, executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Cannon of Phoenix, a member of Personal Freedom Outreach, a nationwide 
research group on what it regards as cult-like religious movements, charged 
that confessions drawn from members are "passed up along the line, and often 
used to keep wayward people in line." 
</P>
<P>
The mainstream Churches of Christ, a loose national fellowship of 13,000 
theologically conservative congregations, has usually sought to distance itself 
from the McKean-led movement. A Churches of Christ magazine in 1987 called the 
Boston church divisive, authoritarian and "dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Olbricht, who chairs Pepperdine University's religion department, said the 
Malibu school is affiliated with the mainline Churches of Christ. "We make it 
clear that Pepperdine is not associated with or supportive of the Boston Church 
of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, they have some fine things going, but they are very 
domineering," Olbricht said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuqua, speaking for the movement, said. "Obviously, there has been controversy. 
But there have been scores of families united, couples brought together who 
were on the brink of divorce."

BOESAK SAYS FUTURE ROLE WILL BE POLITICAL 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent anti-apartheid religious leader in South 
Africa, has confirmed his resignation as minister of his church and moderator 
of the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in the wake of a reported sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak said he is now open to a purely political role in the anti-apartheid 
campaign to bring a united, non-racial democracy to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak originally announced July 8 that he was leaving his church and his 
position as the highest official in the mixed-race denomination. This was two 
days after reports in the South African press that he and television journalist 
Elna Botha spent four days together at a seafront hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Later reports by his lawyer indicated that Boesak was reconsidering his 
decision to leave as minister of his church. Boesak is president of the 
Geneva-based World Alliance of Reformed Churches, but he has not resigned from 
that organization. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak also said he and his wife, Dorothy, will divorce and that he will 
continue to see Botha.

SHEIK IS EULOGIZED BY IOC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheik Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, who was killed during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, 
was remembered Friday as a progressive and ambitious leader in international 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
Fahd had been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1981, 
president of the Olympic Council of Asia and a vice president of both the 
international soccer and team handball federations. 
</P>
<P>
According to an IOC statement, Fahd was killed Thursday while defending the 
Dasman Palace of his brother, Kuwait ruler Jabbar Al Ahmed al Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic movement has thus lost a highly valued personality whose 
contribution to Olympicism and sport in Kuwait, Asia and the world was 
especially fruitful," the IOC said. 
</P>
<P>
Anita DeFrantz, an IOC member from Los Angeles, said Fahd was active in a 
movement to encourage more Asian women to participate in sports. 
</P>
<P>
She said intermediate hurdler Nawal El Mouwatakel, who in 1984 became the first 
Moroccan woman to win an Olympic gold medal, recently went to Kuwait at Fahd's 
invitation to advise him. 
</P>
<P>
He also assisted in the organization of a symposium on women's sports in Asia, 
which is scheduled for mid-August in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to be influential in international sports," DeFrantz said. "He was 
on the way up." 
</P>
<P>
Elected this summer as vice president of the international soccer federation, 
Fahd was credited for the renewed enthusiasm for the sport in his country. 
Kuwait advanced to the World Cup for the first time in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"He was responsible for new ideas, remodeled stadiums, better coaches and youth 
programs in Kuwait," said Keith Walker, secretary general of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost somebody who contributed to the sports movement in a big way. He 
was a doer, somebody who could get things done all over the world."
