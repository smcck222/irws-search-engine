COVER STORY: ANCHORED IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO GET AHEAD IN THE TV NEWS BUSINESS, WHERE LOOKS COUNT BUT AREN'T 
EVERYTHING 
</P>

Legend has it one Los Angeles news anchor found out he was fired the day he 
went to the station's tailor . . . and discovered a new blazer had been ordered 
for every anchor except him. At that moment he no doubt wondered what it is 
that keeps a news anchor on the air in this competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie "Broadcast News," William Hurt's character describes the key as 
"selling this idea of you . . . You're sort of saying, 'Trust me; I'm 
credible.' " That and a few clever pointers (sitting on the bottom of one's 
blazer to keep it from wrinkling, being careful not to make one's eyes look 
shifty) seemed to help Hurt make it in the TV news biz. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, news specialist Connie Timpson of the media consulting firm 
Frank N. Magid Associates says, "Gimmicks don't work. Really good communicators 
don't need them," and the best anchors "care more about the information they're 
delivering than they care about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Who can really say what gives one anchor 30 years of staying power and has 
another continually updating his or her resume? 
</P>
<P>
We asked various Los Angeles anchors what they think keeps people tuning in. 
All had ideas about what makes a good anchor, yet few could put a finger on 
what makes viewers like one and dislike another. They described it as a 
chemical process as mysterious as falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT MAKES A GOOD ANCHOR? 
</P>
<P>
LINDA ALVAREZ 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 4 p.m. KNBC) 
</P>
<P>
Honesty, ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I learned as a teacher is you can't stand up in front of the 
kids and pretend you know what you're talking about; they can tell. (Viewers 
also know) when someone has done his or her homework." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN BEARD 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. KNBC) 
</P>
<P>
Insatiable curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to know a little bit about everything because you never know what 
you'll be reporting. Nobody was expecting (the day of the Metro Rail tunnel 
fire) that we'd have to be reporting the timetable of the Metro Rail 
construction or the cost of its overrun. There are times more often than you 
think, really, when you may be required to talk for literally half an hour on 
one topic. So you need to be an information sponge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LARRY CARROLL 
</P>
<P>
(Saturday and Sunday, 10 p.m. KCAL) 
</P>
<P>
Reporting background, analytical skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology makes demands on people that have never been made before in this 
business. You have to gather information virtually instantaneously, analyze it 
and regurgitate it. We have to be able to write, to deliver written words in a 
way that's engaging, that's magnetic . . . because the easiest thing to do is 
to change channels on a television set." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JERRY DUNPHY 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. KCAL) 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge, calmness. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing that ever happened to me was (a computer failure) where we'd 
get the first four lines of one story, and the rest of another story. If you 
took the time to say, "Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know what is 
happening to me here," you'd lose half your audience. . . . No matter how much 
presence you have, you can still look a little klutzy when that happens." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HAL FISHMAN 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 10 p.m. KTLA) 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge, objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an assistant professor of government at Cal State L.A. I made a decision 
to do TV news, but I've always been a political scientist. I think that's the 
best background you can have for news. . . . We've had a lot of stories from 
the Berlin Wall when it was coming down -- I was there when it went up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PAT HARVEY 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 9 p.m. KCAL) 
</P>
<P>
Professionalism, credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to think of (talking to) faces sometimes, not just to a camera. I come 
across better to me when I humanize what I'm doing. I feel a little closer to 
people. If I were just talking to a camera, then who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JIM LAMPLEY 
</P>
<P>
(Sunday, 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.; Monday-Thursday, 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. KCBS) 
</P>
<P>
Natural curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"Every great reporter has had an innate, inexplicable desire to want to know 
something and be the first to tell people about it. I have that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KELLY LANGE 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. KNBC) 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge, command of situation in newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen people come in in a blaze of glory. I can tell you in every single 
case that if it's backed up by some substance, it'll work. If not, it won't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JESS MARLOW 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 5 p.m. KNBC) 
</P>
<P>
Good reporting skills, 
</P>
<P>
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"(The best anchor is) a good reporter who acknowledges that the story is more 
important than the performance. Personality almost ought to be inadvertent -- 
there are some awfully good reporters you still wouldn't want your sister to 
date." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANN MARTIN 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. KABC) 
</P>
<P>
Being oneself, honesty. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an Aunt Eileen and an Uncle Tom in Burbank. When I started doing this, 
I used to imagine I was telling them what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KEITH MORRISON 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 6 p.m. KNBC) 
</P>
<P>
Empathy, ability to tell 
</P>
<P>
a good story. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not particularly glib, you see, so I get very worried when I strike out on 
a topic on my own. The problem with being glib is that you do a little verbal 
dance, without really supplying information. . . . But when you're up to your 
behind in alligators, you do say stupid things sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PAUL MOYER 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. KABC) 
</P>
<P>
Honesty, knowledge, curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say about local news, 'They take these bimbos and bimbettes 
and stick 'em up there.' That's a lot of baloney. Everybody would like to think 
that you could take somebody literally off the street. You cannot just sit Ken 
and Barbie up there. It doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WARREN OLNEY 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 10 p.m. KCOP) 
</P>
<P>
Being oneself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's really presumptuous to think you can add something substantial 
that the reporter hasn't included in the story. It's dangerous. If I know 
something and feel it's been left out, I include it. What I don't like to do is 
distort the story. As a reporter, I had experiences where anchors distorted a 
story I did by pontificating on it. They had no idea." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BILL RITTER 
</P>
<P>
(Sunday, 11 p.m. KTTV) 
</P>
<P>
Reporting background, trustworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
"Personality isn't like a shtick. What (good anchors) have is credibility. I 
think people with a shtick have a short-lived shtick. It works in sports and 
weather for sure, but in news the shtick is credibility and trustworthiness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WENDY RUTLEDGE 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 10 p.m. KCOP) 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge, compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"What sells as an anchor is definitely personality, like the kind conveyed in 
the ad-lib, lighthearted portion of the news. That's when people form their 
opinions about the person themselves. Some of the more homey, relaxed anchors 
play well. This market is not into pretension. (Viewers like) a genuine 
appearance -- people you'd want to be your neighbors. I aspire to that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRICIA TOYOTA 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, noon and 6 p.m. KCBS) 
</P>
<P>
Reliability, community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important qualities "is a sense of community, a sense of the 
history of Southern California and Los Angeles, who lives here, and what the 
major issues are in this community. It's important for an anchor to be involved 
in community activities, to make ourselves accessible to the public so we 
demystify what we do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BREE WALKER 
</P>
<P>
(Sunday, 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.; Monday-Thursday, 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. KCBS) 
</P>
<P>
Involvement, understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the (viewer's) sense that I'm comfortable about a story because I know 
more about it that I can tell you right now. . . . You convey that through your 
eyes and your body language. It's chemistry, an intangible thing. . . . Some 
anchors have it quite obviously more than others." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COLLEEN WILLIAMS 
</P>
<P>
(Monday-Friday, 5 p.m. KNBC) 
</P>
<P>
Rapport with staff; listening to, instead of just reading, the news. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes me work is that I have to like the person I'm on the air with. 
There needs to be rapport, a certain amount of respect. Some of it has to do 
with time. You both have to have the same sort of focus, and then time -- just 
like a marriage."

ON THE RECORD: HICKOX EXPLORES DARK HEART OF LYRIC MUSE WITH 'POPPEA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Claudio Monteverdi and his librettist, Gian Francesco Busenello, created 
"L'Incoronazione di Poppea" around 1640 there were as yet no codified operatic 
traditions or conventions. The field remained open for cultivation and 
invention. Anything went. And this Italian twosome went about their task with a 
degree of emotional veracity that was not to be found again in opera until our 
own century. 
</P>
<P>
"L'Incoronazione di Poppea" is about lust -- of the flesh and for political 
power. It deals specifically with the ambitious, unprincipled Poppea's 
successful attempt, against tremendous odds, to share the throne of Rome with 
the equally debased Nero. In the world of corruption and deceit in which 
Busenello deals, taking his plot from historical sources, evil wins out at 
every turn. 
</P>
<P>
It is a work of wrenching dramatic force couched in a musical idiom that could 
strike ears attuned only to later, lyric forms of opera as being as alien as 
anything written last week. Especially so in a new, optimally "authentic" 
recorded edition (Virgin Classics 90775, 3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Richard Hickox, who showed us how accessible early opera could be 
with his performances of Handel's "Alcina" for Los Angeles Music Center Opera 
during its inaugural season, goes much further into the dark heart of the lyric 
muse with "Poppea." 
</P>
<P>
His edition is instrumentally spare, hardly going beyond what the composer 
himself set down in what is generally regarded as a form of orchestrational 
shorthand. Most often we hear a singer backed only by continuo instruments. 
</P>
<P>
To a sympathetic ear, there can be as much dramatic force in Monteverdi's 
quasi-declamation as in all the heroic, anguished barking of Wagner's "Ring" -- 
given the presence of Arleen Auger as the Poppea. Auger conveys Poppea's power 
over Nero in slight, devastatingly effective inflections of dynamics and color: 
the vocal equivalents of an inclination of the head, an arched eyebrow or a 
pout. Her diction is splendidly pointed, the voice effortlessly produced and 
frighteningly virginal when the emotions it expresses are most base. 
</P>
<P>
Auger, Hickox and his superb City of London Baroque Sinfonia make this "Poppea" 
a revelatory listening experience without getting all the help they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Mezzo Della Jones (who was also in the Los Angeles "Alcina" with Auger) gives 
us more of Nero's passion than we need, with much of her singing shrill and 
unmusical. Linda Hirst as Ottavia, Nero's abandoned empress and potentially the 
most sympathetic character in the opera, is unsteady and subject to pitch 
problems, and James Bowman is a dramatic cipher as Poppea's betrayed husband. 
</P>
<P>
But Gregory Reinhart as the not-so-noble Seneca is a powerful vocal and 
dramatic presence in what can, in lesser hands, be the prototype of every 
tedious toga-bass part in later Italian opera. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever one's misgivings, this "Poppea" is mandatory listening for anyone 
interested in opera's astonishingly mature youth. And for the presence of 
Arleen Auger. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1720s opera had been become a popular, theatrical art, far removed from 
the ducal salons where Monteverdi's works were performed. Even in the best 
hands -- Handel's -- the wildest improbabilities, indeed the whole 
paraphernalia of mythology, replaced the realistic, timeless drama of "Poppea." 
</P>
<P>
Although Handel was saddled with his share of atrocious librettos, his melodic 
invention and gift for characterization saved the opera from its plot. 
</P>
<P>
In "Flavio" (1723), however, Handel and librettist Nicola Haym mocked the very 
conventions they supposedly honored. Each of the "noble" characters is at one 
point or another sent up. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of Handel's stage works, its day will come -- if performed with 
anything resembling the expertise and wit that went into this first complete 
recording (Harmonia Mundi 901312/13, 2 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
Rene Jacobs, a distinguished Handel singer himself, conducts the excellent 
Swiss Ensemble 415 (the pitch at which they play) and a stylish cast including 
countertenors Jeffrey Gall and Derek Lee Ragin, soprano Lena Lootens and, 
especially, a lush-voiced, sexy, agile mezzo named Bernarda Fink. 
</P>
<P>
"Giulio Cesare," which immediately followed the much shorter "Flavio" in 
Handel's operatic canon and which is in need of an up-to-date recording, 
appears in a modern-instrument version on the Italian Nuova Era label (6863/65, 
3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of some decent singers in what is purportedly a studio 
recording (Nuova Era specializes in live- performance releases), coordination 
between voices and orchestra is so poor that in the opening aria, Martine 
Dupuy's Caesar and conductor Marcello Panni's instrumentalists are as far as a 
measure apart. Things improve thereafter, but never sufficiently to merit the 
serious listener's attention.

MUSIC NEWS: DOYENNE OF DA CAMERA SOCIETY FACES THE CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the beginning this fall of an 11th season at "Chamber Music in Historic 
Sites" -- the successful and highly visible concert series which attempts to 
match chamber repertory, specific ensembles and appropriate performance venues 
-- founder MaryAnn Bonino says she remains fascinated by organizing and running 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
"Every season brings new artists, new ideas, new challenges," the doyenne of 
the Da Camera Society -- sponsor of the multi-part series -- and professor at 
Mount St. Mary's College, says, describing her work. And, bottom line, Bonino's 
concert projects are thriving. 
</P>
<P>
About the historic in Historic Sites, the impresario acknowledges that her 
thinking has changed on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
"I now take an optimistic view of history, based on what I've learned in the 
business of putting on concert events in many differing locales," she claims. 
</P>
<P>
"I now believe that what is new and good right now -- recent architecture, in 
particular -- will be considered historical in two years. So, this season, we 
are featuring a larger number of contemporary sites." 
</P>
<P>
And, she adds, "As always, homes and buildings created by the imaginations of 
architects who are today still alive." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 lineup of Chamber Music in Historic Sites, extending from late 
October to mid-May, closely matches in size and makeup the previous season. In 
1989-90, the Mount St. Mary's-sponsored events numbered 52; according to the 
latest count -- concerts are being added to the roster right now -- the 1990-91 
year will offer 59 concerts. 
</P>
<P>
These peripatetic events will take place in a variety of expected and 
surprising public and private locations: 
</P>
<P>
* The now-being-refurbished Uniroyal Tire and Rubber Plant, overlooking the 
Santa Ana Freeway in East Los Angeles, which Bonino calls "probably the second 
most recognizable landmark, after City Hall, in all Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
* The fabled Dunbar Hotel on South Central Avenue -- Los Angeles' first 
integrated hotel -- where the Alexander-Clayton-Hamilton Trio will offer a 
"jazz afternoon," Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
* The Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
* The Fenyes Mansion in Pasadena, a Beaux Arts home where Calliope, the touring 
Renaissance band, will perform, Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
* The Mayan Theater in downtown Los Angeles, where the "Aztec jazz" ensemble, 
Huayucaltia will offer its crossover musics in a Mayan temple setting, April 
12. 
</P>
<P>
* Villa Narcissa, a garden home overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Palos Verdes, 
where the Amadeus Winds will play Mozart on a Fall afternoon, Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
* The so-called Jesse Lasky estate, a sprawling Mediterranean villa "with a 
Busby Berkeley, Art Deco pool," in Hollywood, where guitar duo Julian Gray and 
Ronald Pearl will play an eclectic program. 
</P>
<P>
Organizing and producing these concerts is, says Bonino, "an endless and 
creative process, which every year is different. No matter what happens, there 
are always surprises." 
</P>
<P>
Still to be completed on the concert roster are three minifestivals, two- or 
three-day visits to outlying districts (this season: Riverside, Rancho Santa Fe 
and the Santa Clarita Valley) with appropriate musical incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Bonino's favorite event of the season? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't resist Monteverdi, and we are bringing the Taverner Consort to 
Wilshire Christian Church (Feb. 5) for its Los Angeles debut in a Monteverdi 
program, including the concerted motets from 'Selva morale e spirituale.' " 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 747-9085. 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSERS' CORNER: "Denizens of the Realm, Faerie" is the title of Mark 
McGurty's new orchestral work, just completed (according to the composer), and 
scheduled to be given its premiere performance by the Long Beach Symphony, 
conducted by JoAnn Falletta, April 20, on a subscription concert in Terrace 
Theater at the Long Beach Convention Center. McGurty is the orchestra's 
composer in residence for the 1990-91 season.

POP FACES: SUNDAYS: DAY OF REST AFTER A YEAR OF HYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harriet Wheeler and David Gavurin, the core members of the hot English rock 
group the Sundays, had mixed feelings about the amenities offered by the luxury 
Hollywood hotel they were staying in recently -- such as free car service 
within a 10-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
"To be taken out in the car from the hotel just to go to a restaurant was 
hilarious," said Wheeler, admitting they had availed themselves of the service, 
even if they did find it a bit silly. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we didn't start out thinking, 'This is where we belong.' " Gavurin 
said as the casually dressed pair sat in the West Hollywood offices of Geffen 
Records, disappointed that a Roxy engagement had been postponed due an illness 
in bassist Paul Brindley's family. "We're going, 'This is incredible.' Instead 
of looking at the next rung on the ladder, we're looking back at the one where 
we've been." 
</P>
<P>
But the rungs are going by very quickly for the young couple (both 27), and 
staving off the rewards of acclaim is becoming an occupation. It started with 
the band's first-ever show, at a London club in 1988. Wheeler and Gavurin had 
been writing songs together since they met in college at Bristol, but the band 
(which also includes drummer Patrick Hannan) had only been together for about 
eight weeks at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd done no gigs, contacted no one, sent out no tapes, and suddenly we had 
record companies courting us and four firm offers," Gavurin said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Wheeler, "It was very exciting as well as quite stupid -- a few weeks of 
not sleeping a lot because there was so much to think about." 
</P>
<P>
Intent on keeping perspective, the Sundays signed with the independent company 
Rough Trade rather than a major label (the debut album "Reading, Writing and 
Arithmetic" was picked up by Geffen's DGC label for U.S. release). But the 
escalation of expectations continued with the band's first single a year ago, 
and then the January release of the album. 
</P>
<P>
The hyperbole-prone British pop press has already topped even itself with 
praise for the Sundays: New Musical Express chose Wheeler and Gavurin for the 
cover of its first issue of the new decade, declaring 1990 "The Year of the 
Sundays." 
</P>
<P>
Melody Maker followed suit two weeks later, fawning over the band it claimed to 
have "discovered" a year before. On this side of the Atlantic, "Reading, 
Writing and Arithmetic" -- with its airy, swirling style centered on Wheeler's 
brittle, doll-like voice -- has shot up the college/alternative charts. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the two are trying to keep their heads, especially given the 
propensity of the British press to later knock down what it had before propped 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that will happen," Gavurin said matter-of-factly. "Obviously it's not 
a pleasurable thing, but I don't think it will affect us. We're pleased we've 
made a record and it's done well. We're pleased we've had our 15 minutes, 
though we hope for more. A life of doing music would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
"The only worry is that people would be so sick of hearing about us that they 
wouldn't even be interested in listening to the music," said Wheeler. "I was 
saying that I'd probably hate us." 
</P>
<P>
Interjected Gavurin, tongue in cheek, "We do hate us." STEVE HOCHMAN

NOTEBOOK: RANCHO SANTA FE: DELICIAS TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The town of Rancho Santa Fe, just northeast of San Diego, is turning into a 
major eating destination. It is the site, to begin with, of the most famous 
small produce farm in the state, Chino Ranch -- noted for supplying top-quality 
fruits and vegetables to Wolfgang Puck, Alice Waters and other restaurant 
stars. It is also the place where one of L.A.'s best French chefs, Claude Segal 
(ex-Ma Maison, Bistango, Four Oaks, and MaBe), has opened Tapenade, at the 
Rancho Valencia tennis resort. 
</P>
<P>
Now another French chef of note, Guy Leroy -- a longtime friend and associate 
of Puck and former chef at the El Encanto Hotel in Santa Barbara, Carsley's in 
Atlanta, Chapo on Melrose Avenue and the Squire Restaurant at San Francisco's 
Fairmont Hotel -- is in charge of a new restaurant kitchen in Rancho Santa Fe 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy's venue is Delicias, just opened by developer Paolo Parviz on the Paseo 
Delicias. "The name is kind of fun," says Leroy. "People ask me, 'What's it 
called? Delicious?' I say, 'Well, it had better be delicious!' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he is not a partner in the new establishment, Leroy says, "I designed 
and built the kitchen exactly the way I wanted it, so I have a little 
Rolls-Royce of a kitchen. We've got a pasta cooker, a mesquite grill, a 
wood-burning oven, a beautiful little pastry room. We're having lots of fun. 
We're making grilled chicken with mashed potatoes, veal flank steak with 
mushroom-Beaujolais sauce, simple food like that. We don't want to be too 
exotic." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, which is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, also boasts a 
shaded patio, framed in rosemary and jasmine. "And you know," Leroy says, 
"having Chino Ranch practically next door is a dream for a chef." 
</P>
<P>
STAYING PUT: Some months ago, Alberto Liani, proprietor of Il Giardino in 
Beverly Hills, told this column that his restaurant was scheduled to be 
demolished later this year. Since that time, though, the city of Beverly Hills 
has declared a moratorium on new construction in the area, and the owner of the 
property -- entertainment business mogul David Geffen -- has canceled his 
construction project. Il Giardino, says Liani, will thus remain open for 
business until further notice. The restaurant has taken advantage of its 
renewed lease to expand, adding a new 60-seat patio and a piano bar.

ANATOMY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Steve Weinstein's July 29 article on Mark Frost, co-creator of television's 
"Twin Peaks," Frost is quoted as describing a character as a "walking 
cerebellum," when he should have called him a "walking cerebrum." 
</P>
<P>
The cerebrum, location of the cerebral cortex, is the major part of the brain 
and controls thought and other intellectual processes. The cerebellum, in 
contrast, is a smaller section that helps maintain coordination and facilitates 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
In Charles Champlin's "Spike Lee Gets Personal," Lee mentioned the athlete who 
tears a rotator "cup" when he meant to say the rotator "cuff," tissue 
surrounding the shoulder joint consisting of muscle and tendons. 
</P>
<P>
Proper labeling of body parts makes for better filmmaking!

R.A. Lee's July 29 letter regarding stars supposedly "outed" (alleged to be

In 1980, Cary Grant sued Chevy Chase for commenting "I understand he is a

LATINO STEREOTYPES AND THE DRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reading July 29 articles about playwrights Luis Valdez and Josefina Lopez, I 
discerned several themes running through both: Immigrants cause problems for 
the union; it's good to "get out of the barrio"; Mexicans are macho; Mexican 
mothers are long-suffering and stoic; Mexican sons are rejected by their 
families if they are homosexual; all other sons are cholos. 
</P>
<P>
Really, I must protest. 
</P>
<P>
Unionization has always taken place among non-union workers. That's what 
unionization means. To see Latino immigrants as somehow weakening the union, 
rather than strengthening it, is to parrot the line of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and the Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's good to get out of the barrio (as both Lopez and Ritchie Valens 
remark) if you want to become rich, declasse and alienated from your own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to name machos, I would pick Ronald Reagan, Chuck Norris and the people 
in the Pentagon, plus a few Ku Klux Klanmen, none of whom appear particularly 
Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican men, in fact, usually have a very sweet nature and are intimidated by 
the aggressive and war-like gringos. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Mexican women being long-suffering, there are plenty examples of 
women doctors, lawyers and politicians in Mexican life, as well as Indian women 
in the villages, who rule the roost, not least of whom are the matriarchal 
Mayas. 
</P>
<P>
No Mexican family that I know of will reject a gay son. The prevailing attitude 
is "you're still our son." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Latinos may now succeed in Hollywood, but at the price 
of stoking racist Anglo stereotypes about a people little understood by 
outsiders, stereotypes little supported by Latinos themselves, who can't be 
bothered with Anglo Angst.

LATINO STEREOTYPES AND THE DRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As I finished reading Sean Mitchell's article on Luis Valdez, a thought flashed 
through my mind: Would Valdez have come so far and done so much if he had not 
faced the obstacle of the "Latino" tag? (By this I mean "obstacle" from the 
Anglo point of view.) 
</P>
<P>
I'm speaking of the extra incentive one feels when he or she strives to do 
better than the Anglo kid with the symbolic silver spoon in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
I feel sorry for those who were not born with a fire inside that, angled just 
right, can grow into a unique creative inferno. 
</P>
<P>
I'm so proud of my Latino brothers and sisters who commit themselves to 
projects beyond being the toughest one in the gang. Viva to us -- we're much 
better than people think we are; but most important, we're much better than 
what we ourselves have thought we were!

HYPE IS HYPE, BUT THIS IS PLAIN CREEPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm amazed I haven't seen anything in print yet about the latest gimmick being 
used by unscrupulous producers to promote their movies. I saw plenty about the 
excess of the Dick Tracy promotions but nothing about the movie 
"Arachnophobia." 
</P>
<P>
I know that the makers of "Arachnophobia" are at fault, because who else could 
train hundreds of spiders to invade my home? 
</P>
<P>
I first noticed them right after the first ads for the movie came out. They 
came into my house, onto my walls, into my cupboards -- everywhere! I lost 
count of how many times I've seen a spider come running across the floor aiming 
straight for a pair of empty shoes. And the time a spider crawled up my shower 
curtain while I was taking a shower, his three-inch body made a silhouette that 
would do Hitchcock proud. 
</P>
<P>
OK already, I'm going to the movie! Honest! I'll see it twice -- I'll even skip 
bargain nights and pay full price. Just call off the spiders. Please?

HOMELESS ADVOCATE OUSTED FROM POMONA COUNCIL RACE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: GEORGE BOSY, WHOSE IDEAS HAVE ANTAGONIZED SOME CITY LEADERS, FILED 
JULY 11 TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL. BUT OFFICIALS DISCLOSED LAST WEEK THAT 12 
SIGNERS OF HIS NOMINATION PAPERS, INCLUDING BOSY, WERE NOT REGISTERED VOTERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
George Bosy, motel keeper to the homeless, antagonist of city officials and 
promoter of trailer villages for the poor, has been scratched from the City 
Council race after he apparently tried to become a candidate before he was 
registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy, who filed July 11 to run for the 3rd District seat vacated by the recall 
of C. L. (Clay) Bryant, received notice from city officials last week that his 
name has been taken off the ballot for the Sept. 18 election. Officials said 
neither Bosy nor 11 other signers of his nomination papers were registered 
voters when the papers were filed with the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy could challenge the disqualification in court, or he could run as a 
write-in candidate. Bosy said he would not comment on his plans until he has 
talked to city officials and obtained legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elizabeth Villarel said that in order to qualify for the special 
election ballot, candidates were required to submit nomination papers signed by 
at least 20 registered voters who live in the 3rd District. She said the county 
registrar of voters checked the 30 signatures on Bosy's petition July 12 and 
found only 15 qualified signers. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Arnold Glasman asked the registrar's office to recheck the 
signatures. The county then determined that 12 of the 15 disqualified signers, 
including Bosy himself, had become registered voters July 13. But, Glasman 
said, their signatures could not count on the nomination papers because state 
law specifies that signers be registered at the time nomination petitions are 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy had filed his nomination papers two days earlier, on July 11. Therefore, 
Glasman said, the city had no choice but to keep Bosy's name off the ballot. 
"It's unfortunate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem apparently arose because some signers of the nomination papers 
filled out forms to register to vote at the same time they signed the 
petitions, Glasman said. There would have been no problem with that procedure, 
he said, had the voter registration forms been filed with the county before the 
nomination papers were filed with the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy had been planning to run with the support of some longtime backers of 
Bryant, a colorful and controversial council member who was recalled June 5 by 
voters amid charges that he had been abusive to city employees and promoted 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
In his last weeks on the council, Bryant was an enthusiastic backer of a plan 
by Bosy to house the homeless in trailers on surplus city property. Bosy, who 
runs the Four Aces Motel, which he has converted into a refuge for the 
homeless, has been seeking city permission to house additional homeless people 
in trailers next to the motel and has asked the city to provide other locations 
where he could set up mobile home complexes for the homeless and other 
low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
In his appearances at council meetings, Bosy has frequently clashed with Mayor 
Donna Smith and city staff members, berating them for allegedly impeding his 
efforts to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy grew especially irate at one council meeting when Smith suggested that the 
city conduct a thorough background investigation before making any agreements 
with him. Soon thereafter, Bosy was arrested by Pomona police on warrants for 
failing to appear at municipal courts in El Monte and West Covina on 
misdemeanor charges of drunk driving and of contracting to do construction work 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they made the arrest after an informant saw a Los Angeles Times 
article and picture on Bosy's homeless project. Bosy's contracting case was 
scheduled for a hearing Thursday, and a Sept. 24 trial has been set for the 
drunk driving matter. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of Bosy's name from the ballot leaves the Sept. 18 special election 
with three candidates: Boyd Bredenkamp, a planning commissioner; Bob Dahms, a 
businessman, and Nancy Lopez, a community volunteer.

<P>
IRAN-CONTRA PROSECUTOR FEELS PRESSURE AS CLOCK RUNS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald J. Ostrow, Ronald J. Ostrow has covered the Justice Department for 
The Times since 1966, and began covering special prosecutors in 1973 when 
Archibald Cox took the job during Watergate. Ostrow interviewed Walsh in the 
independent counsel's conference room. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the steam of a Washington summer, Lawrence E. Walsh shows not a wrinkle 
in his pin-collar shirt, dark tie and three-piece charcoal suit. He seems 
unchanged by the years. He still has the look of the highly successful 
55-year-old Wall Street lawyer he was -- 23 years ago. Although facing 
imminent, crucial decisions as independent counsel prosecuting the Iran-Contra 
crimes, he talks of them with the tone and distance of a keen observer rather 
than a central participant. 
</P>
<P>
The "backbone of steel" that one longtime colleague says runs through Walsh's 
frame is covered by old-style courtliness, geniality and precision in 
responding to questions. Only occasionally does the hard core surface, as when 
Walsh explains why he won't throw in the towel, despite receding public 
interest in the scandal that rocked the Reagan Administration, increased 
congressional criticism and a highly critical reversal on July 20 of former 
White House aide Oliver L. North's conviction by a 2-1 vote of the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals here. 
</P>
<P>
That reversal represented a setback as dramatic as the milestone of the April 
conviction on all counts of North's former superior, John M. Poindexter, 
President Reagan's national security adviser. At this stage, Walsh won't say 
whether and how he will appeal that ruling. But most legal observers believe he 
wants to go directly to the Supreme Court to prevent immunity granted during 
congressional hearings from giving witnesses a free pass from any future 
prosecution for their acts. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's steel was tempered during the Great Depression when, fresh out of law 
school, he joined a state special prosecutor's staff probing corruption among 
Brooklyn prosecutors. Then came more racket-busting and gangster-chasing as an 
assistant district attorney under the newly elected New York district attorney, 
Thomas E. Dewey. Later, he served Gov. Dewey as chief counsel in Albany and was 
the first director of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong Republican, Walsh was named a federal judge by President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, but stepped down after three years to become deputy attorney 
general under his colleague on the Dewey prosecution team, Atty. Gen. William 
P. Rogers. Then came the blue-chip private law practice in Manhattan for 20 
years -- and six-figure annual income -- though he found time to serve as 
chairman of the American Bar Assn.'s judge evaluation panel and as ABA 
president. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he left New York for Oklahoma City, his wife's hometown. But he still 
handled cases coming from the East. He is now past the 3 1/2-year mark as 
independent counsel -- a job Walsh had thought would take two years -- and 
there is no end in sight. But he seems vitalized by the need to establish 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Rep. William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.), a member of the former 
Iran-Contra Committee, has called for you to fold up the tent and end the 
investigation. Are you considering that? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's sort of an overhanging consideration and has been for some time. 
The alternatives are . . . to leave matters, not to conclude it; or to refer 
matters to the Department of Justice; or to have a new independent counsel take 
over these matters. Balancing these alternatives, we have concluded that the 
matters that we're now working on are best handled by our continuation. If we 
tried to give them to someone else, there would be a substantial waste of 
accumulated education. And, second, they are still subject to the same 
sensitivity and potential appearance of conflict of interest that caused the 
original referral to this office. So although just about all of us would like 
to go to something else, we haven't reached a point where we think we can do 
that with responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Critics have said the effort here is really a left-right contest: What's 
being re-fought here is the dispute over aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. How do 
you respond? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't think there's a left-right aspect to it. We think that our work, in 
addition to dealing with crime generally, has a particular importance because 
of its effect in preserving the checks and balances which the Constitution 
provides for and which are unique and essential to our form of government. It 
simply comes down to establishing illegal or criminal deception of Congress. 
That's the central concern. That isn't a left or right thing. It wouldn't make 
any difference which party was in control of which branch. The two branches are 
a check upon each other, and all we're interested in is establishing the 
precedent that false statements will not go unprosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should a precedent as important as that be established through the mechanism 
of an independent counsel rather than the regular prosecutive arm of 
government? 
</P>
<P>
A: It seems to me it is very likely that it should. If there is a conflict 
(within) an Administration . . . and if there are several people holding high 
office in an Administration who are subjects of such an investigation, the 
whole idea of the independent-counsel statute was that this investigation be 
conducted by someone who is not affiliated with that Administration -- whereas 
the attorney general, of course, is an important member of the Administration, 
regardless of his contact with the activities under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you sense, though, that the American people seem barely interested in 
Iran-Contra these days? Whereas if you look back at the same juncture in 
Watergate, there was still a rather intense interest. 
</P>
<P>
A: I try to remember Watergate. I don't remember how long it went on, and even 
there I think there was a waning interest as it broke down into individualized 
prosecutions -- important though they were. Lawyers followed them. But here, 
I'm continuously surprised by stray expressions of interest from just people I 
run into. They seem aware of the work, they're very aware of the difficulty 
caused by the immunity grants and sort of give a sense that although it's been 
drawn out they'd like it completed. Not abruptly terminated. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you have any feeling that you are losing -- to borrow the words of a 
former target of another special prosecutor -- your political base, your 
political support? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Losing might be too strong a word. A gradual diminution, perhaps, 
because of the intrusion of other things. But it seems to me that the political 
base is, one, in the interest of the press; the interest of Congress, and third 
would be a more generalized interest of lawyers and the public. I haven't felt 
a loss of interest. Indeed, with the (former National Security Adviser John M.) 
Poindexter conviction I had a feeling that it peaked up again. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How has the reversal of the Oliver North conviction affected your office's 
work? Is it such that you have to now concentrate on the appeal and forgo other 
prosecutions that you might have brought? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're not mutually inconsistent. There is an intense concentration on the 
opinion because we have to decide what to do in response to that, but the other 
work goes on, too. There's some distraction from it because we're not a large 
staff any more. If we concentrate on one thing we have to slight something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At the time of the Poindexter conviction on all counts, you said that it 
probably would be fall before it was clear whether there would be additional 
charges, or whether you then would be shifting to concentrating on the final 
report. Does that timetable still hold? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This reversal may interrupt that by a diversion of manpower, or person 
power I should say. It doesn't have to be taken into account as a matter of law 
on any of these matters, but it can have an indirect effect on them, I guess, 
in ways that I can't describe without getting into matters that are internal to 
the investigation or the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there statute of limitations problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't think there are any critical statute of limitations problems that we 
have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But there are some other problems you can't get into because they would 
reveal the nature of the investigation? 
</P>
<P>
A: Or witnesses or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the North decision, the necessity of appealing or whatever you choose 
to do made it less likely that you will try to scrutinize the conduct of 
several executive-branch agencies that may have supported the work of the 
National Security Council in Iran-Contra? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's hard to give a categorical answer to that. Legally, it's no impediment 
insofar as the subjects of these potential targets or these investigations or 
concerns. But as I indicated, there are matters that I can't discuss where 
there might be an indirect effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What comes to my mind when you mention that is the willingness of North to 
continue to go before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
A: I can't discuss that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When we talk about several executive-branch agencies that supported the work 
of the NSC in Iran-Contra, what we're talking about is the CIA, the Defense 
Intelligence Agency and the FBI and the State Department and the Defense 
Department? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think you left out one of the intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The National Security Agency. 
</P>
<P>
A: When I talked about supporting agencies, those were the agencies that were 
generally in mind without attributing any misconduct to any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The diversion question -- the diversion of funds from the Iran portion of 
the alleged conspiracy to support the Contras -- seems to have taken a back 
seat in the investigation. Does this mean that you've sidestepped a central 
issue in the scandal? 
</P>
<P>
A: It wasn't a deliberate sidestep. It was a limitation of the trials that were 
forced upon us by the intelligence agencies, which claimed that information 
which the court held relevant could not be made available for the trial without 
identifiable danger to the national security. Those claims, for whatever they 
were worth, were supported by the attorney general, and there is no way the 
court can overrule that decision, nor can the independent counsel. So that was 
the reason the diversion wasn't prosecuted publicly. 
</P>
<P>
To say that it took a back seat is to overstate it. It's always there as a 
dramatic indication of what can be concealed once we tolerate false statements 
to Congress. It was not just aid to the Contras that was concealed, or even 
attempts to release the hostages. There was a concept of covert action being 
carried out by private persons, without authorization or knowledge of Congress 
and without appropriation by Congress, using funds obtained from foreign 
countries or from private persons -- but carried out under the aegis of 
executive-branch officials. So it's never in a back seat. It's a glaring 
example of an evil that becomes attainable if false statements to official 
inquiries by Congress are to be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think this may be a tip of the iceberg? That this goes on in the 
executive branch's relations with Congress and that it happens that your 
investigation has uncovered it and established it? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's important that we make certain distinctions. Having served in 
the executive branch of government, it's very understandable that many things 
being done in the executive branch are not made public and are not disclosed to 
Congress voluntarily or even informally. And that in the informal give and take 
between Congress and executive branch officers there is a certain amount of 
horse-trading that's gone on in which all the facts aren't always stated 
accurately. 
</P>
<P>
But when Congress, through its committee, formally makes an inquiry of the 
executive branch, or any officer of the executive branch, it's acting under its 
oversight powers and its appropriations powers. It's entitled then to an honest 
answer. If the executive branch feels an answer shouldn't be given to Congress, 
it must claim its executive privilege and refuse to answer openly and take the 
consequences. Or it must tell the truth. It can't lie to conceal something it 
doesn't want to tell Congress and not be prosecuted for a crime. That's our 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But doesn't that ability to claim executive privilege then blunt what 
you've established here? 
</P>
<P>
A: Whenever an executive officer -- and there are very few who can claim it to 
begin with -- but when that's done, that is a public acknowledgement that they 
are unwilling to tell the facts and Congress may withhold support just on that 
basis. Congress at least is on notice that something is going on and the 
executive officer is unwilling to tell them about it. They may take the kind of 
action that Congress has available to it to protect against such undisclosed 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the wake of the Poindexter conviction, you spoke of a pattern of deceit 
being uncovered by your investigation. Deceit by whom against whom? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's one of the questions to which answers are still being sought. What I 
was saying was that in focusing narrowly on just who knew or didn't know about 
the particular diversion in this case, it overnarrowed the inquiry. And a more 
appropriate question is that if Congress was being deceived, who were parties 
to this broader activity of deceit as distinguished from the narrower activity 
of the diversion itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you took this job on, you had already entered your 70s. Had you had 
any expectation that it would go on this long? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, I thought it would be over in two years. And I think we might have made 
it if it hadn't been for the delay of trying to get the Swiss records, and also 
the delay that came when Judge (Gerhard A.) Gesell severed the cases so that 
each defendant had to be tried separately. That added a full year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you got any regrets about taking the job? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, I've certainly found it stimulating. It may be exasperating, but it's 
been a very interesting professional experience, if nothing else. I've had a 
good staff to work with. If you're in your 70s, it's very good to be surrounded 
by young lawyers who are hard working, to say nothing of the non-lawyers.

LOSING WHILE WINNING: THE ABORTION ALBATROSS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS ARE BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT EFFORTS TO 
OVERTURN ROE VS. WADE ARE A FORM OF POLITICAL RUSSIAN ROULETTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein, Ronald Brownstein is a national political correspondent 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only group in Washington more concerned than abortion-rights activists 
about President George Bush's nomination of David H. Souter to the Supreme 
Court are the people who make their living electing Republicans to office. 
</P>
<P>
Seared by the furor over last year's Webster decision, which merely gave states 
additional latitude to regulate abortion, few ranking Republican operatives 
still want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision 
guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But no one knows how to extricate the party from its commitment to do just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Among Republican strategists there is widespread -- if still largely private -- 
agreement that a decision undermining Roe could rip open the GOP coalition. "I 
don't think any professional in the party wants to see Roe overturned," said 
Republican consultant Roger J. Stone. "In the post-Webster environment, you 
could peel off young people, suburbanites, women and Jews -- I don't see any 
anxiousness in our party to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Until the Webster decision, most Republicans -- whatever their feelings on the 
issue's morality -- considered opposition to abortion an electoral plus. It 
allowed the GOP to crystallize the enthusiasm of anti-abortion forces and 
conservative evangelicals who were surging into politics on the galvanizing 
conviction that America had lost its moral bearings. And, party strategists 
felt, the anti-abortion position cost them little with voters who disagreed -- 
as long as the courts did nothing to restrict abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy to say in our platform Roe should be overturned when there was no 
prospect of doing that," said Stone. 
</P>
<P>
That was a shrewd, if cynical, calculation. The vast majority of Americans vote 
not on abstract ideology but tangible reality. For abortion opponents, the 
post-Roe world of 1.5 million annual legal abortions was distressingly 
tangible. For abortion-rights supporters, by contrast, the GOP's rhetoric was 
only an abstraction that in no way diminished their access to abortion. Many 
Republicans truly embraced the anti-abortion cause; but others less sympathetic 
understood that as long as the GOP failed to implement its restrictive agenda, 
it could enjoy the best of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
Implicitly recognizing that dynamic, the Reagan White House never seriously 
pushed an constitutional amendment to ban abortion. Bush has shown even less 
interest in a frontal legislative assault. 
</P>
<P>
But since 1980, the GOP platform has called for appointment of judges "who 
respect . . . the sanctity of innocent human life." That commitment has 
conscripted the GOP into a decade-long game of political Russian roulette. Each 
time a vacancy opened on the Supreme Court, the Reagan White House put a bullet 
in another chamber, waited for a case challenging Roe to come before the 
justices, pulled the trigger -- and held its breath. 
</P>
<P>
So far the cylinder has always come up empty, as the court refused to mount a 
direct challenge to the legal right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But with four firm anti-Roe votes in place, Souter's nomination could tip the 
odds -- and force the GOP at last to redeem its long-standing debt to the 
anti-abortion forces. "This was a deal with the devil where we thought we would 
never have to pay the piper," said one nervous Republican consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The conundrum facing the GOP is that while most strategists believe an adamant 
anti-abortion position is a losing hand over the long term, the public and 
personal commitments of many party leaders to the cause are too deep to easily 
shed. 
</P>
<P>
Though Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater has spoken of making 
the party a "big tent" on the issue, any White House move that diminishes the 
party's official support for the anti-abortion cause would set off internal 
civil war. "There is no graceful way for the party to remove itself from the 
commitments it has made on this issue, especially since 1980," said Bill Price, 
president of Texans United for Life, a leading anti-abortion group. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republican strategists consider the Souter nomination a masterstroke 
because his thin record on abortion sustains the hope of delaying a 
confrontation on the issue at least through the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
But those contests are only the first stage of an extended political process 
whose stakes rise at each turn. In political terms, the impact of the Souter 
nomination hearings on this fall's elections are dwarfed by the potential 
fallout in 1992, if Souter wins confirmation and creates a majority for 
reversing the Roe vs. Wade decision itself. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts in both parties agree that a decision eliminating the legal right to 
abortion could become a dominant -- even pivotal -- issue in the 1992 
presidential campaign. If the court rejects Roe any time in the next two terms, 
states across the country would be ensnarled in bitter debates over whether to 
recriminalize abortion even as the presidential race unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
At best, said one senior Republican strategist in close contact with the White 
House, Bush might be able to argue by then that the decision is out of his 
hands. But at worst, other GOP analysts say, Bush could be forced to run atop a 
party hopelessly divided over the issue and facing intensely mobilized 
opposition from abortion-rights supporters. By itself that probably wouldn't be 
enough to topple Bush -- but, if the economy slips further, it could make him 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible that Souter, if confirmed, may join the contingent that has 
avoided a broad ruling on Roe, and thus delay the issue again. That's the quiet 
hope of those Republicans looking for signs Souter may be a Trojan horse in 
reverse -- a cipher whose blank slate obscures not opposition but support for 
legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But if that turned out to be Souter's position -- either on legal, procedural 
or moral grounds -- the pressure on Bush to name an explicitly anti-abortion 
judge to fill the next vacancy would be overwhelming. And with two judges who 
support abortion rights over 80, appointments could face Bush before 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly abortion opponents are expecting Souter -- and any additional Bush 
appointments -- to bend their way. "When I came into the movement a decade ago, 
we were losing (Supreme Court) cases 7-2 and 6-3," Price said. "Very shortly I 
think we are going to be in a 6-3 (anti-abortion) position, and by the time 
Bush is finished we could be in an 8-1 or 9-0 position." 
</P>
<P>
Anything less would ferociously disappoint anti-abortion activists, who feel 
their time has finally come. But as the precipice draws closer, voices are 
rising among those GOP activists urging the party to turn away from what they 
consider a politically suicidal and socially disruptive commitment to upending 
Roe -- if Souter's nomination hasn't already sealed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a system in place where we are headed in the direction of overturning 
Roe," said Republican consultant John Buckley. "But we are not locked into it. 
. . . There is a moment of reckoning coming for the GOP." 
</P>
<P>
This reckoning is descending on unlikely shoulders. Bush, a late convert to the 
anti-abortion cause, a conciliator who splits the difference the way a logger 
splits firs, may nonetheless be the one who confronts the final eruption of 
this social fissure. That would be a great irony. But the White House might be 
too busy putting out fires to appreciate it.

BUDGET: INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH THE DEFICIT AND SOLVING THE S&amp;L MESS, 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WAGE A WAR OF RECRIMINATIONS.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republicans are beginning to smell disaster. The economy is sliding into 
recession. War in the Middle East poses a danger to oil prices. The 
savings-and-loan scandal has acquired a new symbol -- not Charles H. Keating 
Jr., the businessman who bought influence in Washington, or Alan Cranston, the 
senator who sold it, but Neil Bush, the President's son who traded on it. 
</P>
<P>
The President was forced to abandon his "no new taxes" pledge in June. In July, 
word of the Administration's tax proposal leaked out. It was greeted by a 
torrent of criticism. The GOP is openly split over how to proceed, or even if 
to proceed, with budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal budget deficit has become the country's No. 1 concern. 
For the first time since he took office, President George Bush's popularity has 
begun to drop. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats are enjoying this immensely. They are daring to think previously 
unthinkable thoughts -- like maybe putting up a candidate for President in 
1992. (Another Walter F. Mondale? Another Michael S. Dukakis? Why bother.) 
</P>
<P>
The Republican response has been to mount a frantic offensive. Not to avert 
disaster, but to avert blame. The GOP has started a carefully orchestrated 
campaign to persuade voters that whatever terrible things happen, it's the 
Democrats' fault. 
</P>
<P>
While the ship of the state is sinking, the Democrats are dancing on the deck 
and the Republicans are organizing a court-martial. Nobody seems to care that 
they're all going to drown. 
</P>
<P>
The budget summit between the Administration and Congress was suspended last 
week so members of Congress could go on vacation. After three months of 
negotiations, there is still no discernible progress toward reducing the 
deficit. "The whole thing isn't going well," one budget negotiator reported. 
"What we need here is a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
How's this for a crisis: The 1991 federal budget deficit is now projected to be 
$169 billion -- far more than the $100-billion deficit projected in January. 
That's not counting the $100 billion the government says it will need next year 
for the S&amp;L bailout -- far more than the $50 billion appropriated by 
Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
The economy grew by only 1.2% last quarter -- far less than projected. That 
makes five successive quarters of slow growth, the longest period of economic 
sluggishness since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
And if the President and Congress can't agree to cut the deficit by $50 billion 
before October, $100 billion in across-the-board spending cuts will kick in. 
Want to know what life would be like without the federal government? Here's 
your chance to find out. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the following steps have been taken to deal with the impending 
disaster. Congress has voted to allow a $322-billion increase in the national 
debt. The federal government now has the authority to go $3.44 trillion into 
debt -- more than $13,000 per person, in case you have your checkbook handy. 
</P>
<P>
The House boldly approved an amendment to remove the Social Security trust fund 
from federal deficit calculations. Without the Social Security surplus, next 
year's deficit would be $245 billion. But we don't have to worry. The amendment 
doesn't take effect until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The budget negotiators have also agreed to hold uninterrupted bargaining 
sessions in September, in an isolated location somewhere outside of Washington. 
Maybe there is a Betty Ford Clinic for financial disorders. If that doesn't 
work, Congress may call a lame-duck session for the deficit. Which means that 
it will take place after the November election, with votes cast by legislators 
who may have already been turned out of office. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, Bush did do his part to advance the agenda. He allowed a plan to 
leak out. The Administration suggested raising the federal excise tax on 
alcohol. Whereupon wine growers and beer drinkers went nuts, and Anheuser Busch 
threatened to drive their Clydesdale horses up the steps of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also suggested limiting the amount of state and local income taxes that 
taxpayers deduct on federal returns. Whereupon the governors went nuts and 
issued a statement opposing "any restrictions on the deductibility of state and 
local taxes as unacceptable encroachments on state systems of taxation." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, thoroughly amused by all this, decided not to release any 
proposal of their own. "We did not pledge that every time the Republicans slit 
their wrists we would slit ours," the chairman of the House Budget Committee 
said. Whereupon Republicans went nuts and started attacking the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans even criticized Bush. Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said, "I 
think it was a major mistake to give up on taxes the way the President did. 
Even though I'm in the budget summit, if we don't get a very good deal, I am 
not going to support the summit package." He added, "I wouldn't ask any 
Republicans to vote for it." That could be a problem for Bush. Gingrich is the 
House minority whip. His job is to round up GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
Bush doesn't know what to do. He praises the Democrats for working with him and 
then criticizes them for their "wild spending habits." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bush told 150 congressional Republicans that he would break the 
week-old cease-fire on partisan rhetoric and attack the Democrats for the slow 
pace of budget negotiations. The President threatened to veto spending bills 
that exceed his budget requests. (There are no such bills.) He threatened to 
force Congress to live with the huge spending cuts that will go into effect if 
there is no agreement by October. (He will have to live with the cuts, too.) 
</P>
<P>
Republicans keep threatening to "go to the people" if they can't get a good 
budget deal. If they do, they are likely to get an earful. Bush's job-approval 
rating has dropped 9 points over the summer, while 64% disapprove of the way he 
is handling the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to another poll, 56% disapprove of the way Bush is handling 
the S&amp;L problem. More people blame the Republicans (35%) than the Democrats 
(19%) for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
So what are the politicians doing about the S&amp;L crisis? They are calling 
each other names. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee called 
President Bush "the Joe Isuzu of the S&amp;L industry." The Democratic governor 
of Ohio said, "If there is a Willie Horton on S&amp;Ls, it's Neil Bush." 
</P>
<P>
Spooked by the Neil Bush problem, the GOP has decided to go on the offensive. 
The GOP took out a newspaper ad during the National Governors' Assn. conference 
last week that displayed the photos of 12 current and former Democratic members 
of Congress. The text read, "These are the guys who let the S&amp;L problem 
explode into a $325-billion national crisis." 
</P>
<P>
As the Republican governor of Maine put it, "The Republicans want to make sure 
people know there's enough blame to go around." Indeed there is. Deregulation 
of business is a Republican idea. Republicans, blinded by deregulatory zeal, 
allowed thrifts to speculate on high-risk investments, while the taxpayers 
guaranteed the money. On the other hand, influence-peddling is a Democratic 
tradition. Congressional Democrats protected the bankrupt S&amp;Ls in return 
for substantial campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly is being done about the S&amp;L crisis? Bush promised, "We will 
not rest until the cheats and the chiselers and the charlatans spend a large 
chunk of their lives behind the bars of a federal prison." That was before his 
son's involvement became an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone in the toughness department, the chairman of the Democratic 
Party said, "Just like the drug dealers, we should hit them hard and then 
harder. Seize their cars. Freeze their assets. Put them on allowances. Try 
them, convict them, get restitution and put them in jail." For the record, he 
was referring to corrupt business executives, not politicians. 
</P>
<P>
What is going on in Washington is not problem-solving. It is recriminations. 
The captain is fighting with the crew. Meanwhile, the ship is going down.

How do we avoid our annual state budget snafu? 
</P>
<P>
Set up a referendum providing that pay for our legislative bodies and the 
governor expire with the budget -- irrevocably. 
</P>
<P>
This would include all perks -- lease cars go into the garage, no meals, no 
travel allowance, etc. What do you think the odds would be that we would never 
again have one budget expire without another one approved?

In response to "Governor Cuts, Signs the Budget," front page, Aug. 1: 
</P>
<P>
Once again state government has undermined and sabotaged California voters and 
the educational system, by offsetting voter-approved increased funding (i.e., 
the lottery and Proposition 98) with severe budget cuts. My yes vote to Prop. 
98 was essentially nullified by Gov. George Deukmejian's "blue pencil." 
</P>
<P>
And many wonder why voter apathy is at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the areas to cut spending, education should be at the bottom of the 
list. Education is a vital investment that provides many priceless returns. If 
we don't invest in quality education now, we will certainly pay later, with 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
At this rate, our greatest natural resource, the human mind, may face 
extinction in the U.S. Without proper education, illiteracy has become a 
national epidemic and crime will continue to become an appealing alternative to 
our discouraged, uneducated youth. The fallout of poor education guarantees 
that our future governors, senators and presidents will be as mindless as our 
current elected officials. On a brighter note, if ignorance is bliss, then 
America will eventually become a euphoric paradise.

LINKING AID TO POPULATION GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Anthony Beilenson's (D-Los Angeles) article on foreign aid and population 
growth (Commentary, July 23) was excellent. Mankind's slow response to the 
ever-more-serious growth of our population is leading us to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government must do more to assist anyone in the world who wants access 
to family planning. The dehumanizing poverty and declining standard of living 
for hundreds of millions of people in less-developed countries are reasons 
enough to do so. 
</P>
<P>
But help must be given for our own sake as well. The Dominican and Mexican 
population explosions illustrate why. The United States has been flooded with 
millions of poor, uneducated Dominicans and Mexicans, who have fled their 
countries and who now contribute to the overcrowding of our cities, 
particularly New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Third World population explosion is everybody's problem. We must insist 
that our government take a more active role to solve it.

Beilenson persists in the utopian vision of Americans telling the rest of the 
world how many babies they should be making. Apparently it is not enough that 
we intervene in their wars and meddle in their internal politics. 
</P>
<P>
Does Beilenson really think it should be the business of the U.S. government to 
attempt to alter the religious and cultural traditions of societies that have 
been in existence for thousands of years?

GOV. DEUKMEJIAN, LEGISLATORS END BUDGET IMPASSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian, in his economic and social shortsightedness, has leaped off 
the path of common sense and landed -- blue pencil and all -- in lame-duck 
history. Although it is unfair to blame all of California's ills on a single 
professional bureaucrat, he has added to the state's problems, not its 
solutions. The tardy budget on which he so viciously fought the Legislature is 
a clear indication of the governor's true legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Who suffers? -- the poor, our children, our future. For example, Deukmejian 
vindictively knifed educational programs aimed at keeping our kids away from 
crime, in school, off of drugs and off of the street. He virtually eliminated a 
well-respected testing program (California Assessment Program) which helps 
educators gauge their performance -- and the "new assessment program" he is 
calling for will take unnecessary time and millions of dollars to put into 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of spending much-needed money on training programs that assist people 
off of welfare, he has cut funding for such programs, as well as welfare 
benefits. $61 million was cut from the community mental health system. Both of 
these systems alleviate the homelessness dilemma. Yet, again, our governor has 
deemed it wise to add to the ranks of homeless people by strangling the 
programs aimed at keeping individuals off of our community sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
What leads people to drugs and crime: insufficient education and opportunity, 
poverty and abuse -- all of which, sooner or later, cause taxpayers a great 
deal more money spent on discipline than prevention. By cutting juvenile 
justice programs and the Child Abuse Prevention Training Act's funding, our 
governor may have balanced this year's state budget, but his decisions will 
cost Californians unnecessary dysfunctional years and billions in future 
cleanup costs. Deukmejian is leaving this state with a miserable legacy and, in 
my opinion, is not leaving office soon enough.

FRUITS OF THE NEW AGE OF DISARMAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ IS ONLY THE START. THIS SHOULD WAKE US TO THE DANGER OF UNCONSIDERED 
DEFENSE CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. BUCHANAN, Patrick J. Buchanan writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as Japan's move into Manchuria in 1931 was a wake-up call to the West, 
heralding what was ahead for the new decade, so the Iraqi drive into Kuwait is 
a harbinger of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
With his blitzkrieg invasion of oil-rich Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has introduced 
us to the new realities of the Near East. The Carter Doctrine, whereby the 
United States vowed to resist with force any effort by a hostile power to take 
over the Persian Gulf, is dead. If you wish to survive in this region, Hussein 
has telegraphed his Arab neighbors, you will answer to Baghdad, not Washington. 
The United States is no longer policeman of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Short of blockading Iraqi ports, an act of war, the U.S. cannot force Hussein 
to cough up the tiny country he has just swallowed. As no vital U.S. interest 
is at stake, we aren't going to do that. An America that packed up and 
abandoned Lebanon after 250 Marines were lost in a single explosion is not 
going to send the 82nd Airborne up the Euphrates valley to avenge Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein gambled that the Rapid Deployment Force and Sixth Fleet were, by 
and large, a superpower bluff. His gamble paid off. Doesn't look very much like 
the end of history, does it? 
</P>
<P>
This display of Iraqi military power came just 24 hours after House Armed 
Services had shredded the U.S. defense budget, voting to kill the B-2 Stealth 
bomber, gut the Strategic Defense Initiative and cut U.S. armed forces by 
129,000 men -- a $24-billion chop. 
</P>
<P>
We are headed for a new disarmament decade; and we had best prepare for more 
mornings like Thursday last. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, 1990 is not 1960. Even after the Reagan buildup, U.S. armed forces and 
battle fleets, first-rate though they are, are still only half the size they 
were when John F. Kennedy held office. Our missile force is inferior to the 
Soviets' and growing more so every month, as Moscow modernizes first-strike 
SS-18 missiles and builds hundreds of new second-strike SS-24 and SS-25 mobile 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
There are a half-dozen regional powers, deeply hostile to U.S. interests, which 
were inconsequential in 1960. Among them are North Korea, Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, 
Syria, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as America's relative power diminishes, U.S. overseas commitments are 
still expanding. We are committed to go to war on behalf of 15 NATO allies and 
our red line has been moved east to the Oder and Neisse Rivers. We just signed 
a pact with Greece to come to its aid in the event of war with Turkey. We have 
a commitment to Israel that brought us to the brink of nuclear war in 1973. In 
the Persian Gulf, until last week, we had the Carter Doctrine. And we still 
have pacts with South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, 
and the Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
And, as new commitments are taken on and the old ones call for more U.S. power 
to sustain them, we have begun closing bases, drawing down troop levels, 
eliminating weapons. If this continues, the United States is headed for 
foreign-policy bankruptcy and eventual war. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that Bush informed Congress that if it is going to eliminate forces, 
he is going to start terminating commitments. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional assault on the defense budget has taken on an almost mindless 
character. Programs cut, like SDI and Stealth, are 21st-Century weapons of 
defense and deterrence, while the armor, which Congress spared, is designed to 
help win World War II in Europe. We are eliminating new planes needed to strike 
and punish potential enemies, while keeping open army bases strategically 
located to protect us from the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The President needs to make some hard choices, and he needs to inform the world 
of the consequences of those choices. If we are going to cut back on the Army, 
Navy and Air Force, we have to begin sending word to nations like Kuwait that 
depended on us, like Kuwait, that they are on their own, so they can begin 
making a separate peace with the Saddam Husseins of the new world. How long can 
the United States continue spending more for the defense of Europe than 
Europeans? How long should we defend the oil lifeline of Europe and Japan, with 
no support from the navies of Europe and Japan? 
</P>
<P>
If America's armed forces are to be cut, they should be cut with an eye to 
defending the American nation and people first. Missile defense is the highest 
priority, followed by the air and naval capacity to defend our continent, 
coasts and sea lanes, and to retaliate against an enemy aggressor. 
Unsurprisingly, this is where the chowderheads of Capitol Hill first decided to 
cut.

THE BUDGET-BUSTERS REGROUP;

<P>
WIELDING THE POWER OF PROPOSITION 98, THE SCHOOLS WON THEIR SHARE -- A LESSON 
NOT LOST ON THE LOSERS.

<P>
The battle for the 1991 California budget is over, and the only contender left 
standing in the middle of the ring is education. It's not unscathed -- there's 
a bit of blood dripping from its nose -- but it's standing, and none of the 
other interests that sought shares of the state budget can say that. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it wasn't a fair fight. Unlike the other combatants, education went 
into the ring with a shield. In a bare-knuckle fight, the one who gets to bring 
a shield usually wins. 
</P>
<P>
Education's shield was Proposition 98, an initiative that was barely passed by 
the electorate in 1988, which guaranteed primary, secondary and community 
college education 40%-plus of the state general fund budget. With that 
protection, education added $1.8 billion to its $17.8-billion budget, an 
increase of 10%. The state budget as a whole increased a smaller 7.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Just about every other agency in the state budget was a loser. 
</P>
<P>
The losers may be down, but they're not unconscious. They know why they lost 
and education won. They know about the shield -- and they each want one of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
Among the losers is health-care funding. Health care makes up less than 15% of 
the state budget, down about 4% or 5% from a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The health-care industry may put up a number of initiatives to protect spending 
on doctors, hospitals and nursing homes. If health took about 20% of the state 
budget a few years ago, it will want to secure 25% now -- just to be on the 
safe side. There are more Californians now, so it figures there are more sick 
ones in need of care. Taking a page from education's notebook, health's 
protected share of the budget probably will have an escalator clause to take an 
even greater share in each passing year. 
</P>
<P>
Welfare will want to protect its share of the budget, and if health care can 
take 25% of the general funds, then so can welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Prisons have been doing quite well under the Deukmejian administration, but the 
governor is ready to hang up his keys. With the Iron Duke no longer available 
to look out for prison interests, they'll need protection of their own. Ten 
percent doesn't seem too much to ask as a guaranteed share of the budget. We're 
talking about public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Local government has been knocked around in the budget battle so many times 
before, it came to this fight a little punchy. The wobbly legs are from years 
of trekking to Sacramento to beg for a share of the budget to fund programs 
imposed by the state to be administered and paid for by the locals. A guarantee 
seems just the tonic to put some spring back in local government's step. 
Fifteen percent seems fair. Twenty percent seems more fair. 
</P>
<P>
And so it will go. Each dependency of the state will place an initiative on the 
ballot to secure protection for itself. When all have armor, there won't be a 
need for budget battles. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, after each agency wins by initiative what it feels is its fair 
share, the guarantees will add up to 175% of the funds available. Isn't it 
impossible to spend 75% more than what you can pay for? Not at all. With the 
cost-of-living escalators currently built into the system outstripping 
available revenue, that's what we regularly get now -- a budget bigger than we 
can afford. 
</P>
<P>
There will be one place where we can cut and save money: the Legislature 
itself. If all these initiatives pass and all the money in the budget is 
automatically designated, we can go back to having a part-time Legislature. A 
one-hour session sounds about right.

'BEAUTIES' SHOWS FACE OF BOMBINGS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW PLAY IS ABOUT 25 HIROSHIMA WOMEN WHO WERE DISFIGURED BY NUCLEAR WARFARE AND 
CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR TREATMENT.

<P>
America's ultimate act of warfare -- the dropping of the atomic bombs on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki 45 years ago -- sets the stage for Dan Seymour's "A-Bomb 
Beauties," making its premiere this weekend at the Burbage Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Beauties" is based on the true story of the Hiroshima Maidens, 25 Japanese 
women, disfigured by the bomb, who were brought to America in 1955 by a group 
of philanthropists to undergo reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"What struck me about the story was its incredible irony," said Seymour, the 
New York playwright who's in town for the opening. "Doing something like that 
-- it's really a good and a bad thing. Yes, the girls were definitely helped in 
terms of getting the use of the hands and arms back. But it was also a way of 
surface-erasing the effects of the bomb, making it all better. They brought 25 
'maidens' here and made their faces pretty. I'm not criticizing the doctors. 
After the fact, what can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
What angers him isn't only the Band-Aid approach to such monumental physical 
and psychic pain but that it tends to obscure the true devastation of nuclear 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the bomb, a commission had gone in and conducted a scientific 
study," he said dryly. "In no way did they try to fix any of the damage. . . . 
I've tried to steer away from questioning whether or not we should've dropped 
the bomb. To me, that's a moot point. What's important is what happened after 
the bomb was dropped. Look at us now. Nuclear proliferation is on top of us. We 
don't look back at the people of Hiroshima, the horror of that day." 
</P>
<P>
In real life, then-Saturday Review Editor Norman Cousins was among those 
leading the effort to bring the women here. Seymour, however, has fictionalized 
his nine characters. Philanthropist Elliott Ryder is a composite of all the 
Americans who were involved; the Asian chaperones are represented by Father 
Tanaka, a Japanese-Catholic priest. "They're the two leading characters," said 
the writer, 33. "The focus of the play is the conflict between the American and 
the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
And the traditionally obedient "maidens" take a back seat to that power play. 
</P>
<P>
"The women are still victims, and these two men are the ones who make all the 
decisions for them," Seymour said. "I didn't write archetypes, but essentially, 
it's how victims of any war are ruled. The women have no control. It's also a 
question of looking at the big picture -- Japanese and American relations -- 
but not the small picture: 'What's good for these women?' I think that typifies 
what America has done since, this big benevolent despot that makes assumptions 
for other people, who's always better than everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The playwright knows that attitude isn't going to win him any popularity 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
"It upsets some people because I'm not writing about America as a hero," he 
said with a shrug. "I get comments from a lot of people my parents' age, and 
some of them still have an abiding hatred of the Japanese. They come up to me 
after readings and say, 'What about Pearl Harbor?' Well, what about Pearl 
Harbor? It was a military installation. Hiroshima: They killed 100,000. Come 
on! To me, there's no comparison. Still, I am pleased when people come out of 
the theater upset. At least they're talking about it; they're not complacent." 
</P>
<P>
Shigeko Sasamori is still talking about it too. One of the famous maidens, 
Sasamori has spent much of the past 35 years being interviewed about her 
experiences; last May, she returned to Japan to supervise a television 
docudrama on her life. 
</P>
<P>
"The actress who was doing my part said, 'You must be very strong.' I told her, 
'I don't think I'm strong or weak. I just lived my life.' " When she came here 
at age 20, Sasamori had already undergone several plastic surgeries in Japan; 
she cannot now recall her feelings about being selected: "I know I wasn't 
jumping for joy." As for her feelings about this play, "It's not my story," the 
Los Angeles resident said firmly. "I don't know what they have written." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour quickly agrees that his vantage point has not been that of an insider. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never begin to talk for these women," said the writer, who has 
dramatized the women's facial scars by costuming them in veils. "What I'm 
trying to capture is what America was like in 1955, how we looked at the world 
around us, how we looked at Japan. We took these 25 girls; we were very 
patronizing, very superior. . . . And yet the characters all believe in what 
they're doing. They're making mistakes, but they're trying to be good men." 
</P>
<P>
Offstage, the writer knows a thing or two about philanthropy. Growing up on the 
move (the son of an oft-transferred employee at Ralston-Purina), he went to New 
York to be an actor. "I didn't handle the acting business well," Seymour said 
lightly. "But now I have a real job." As director of the Mental Illness 
Foundation, "We raise money for schizophrenia research, community housing, 
halfway houses for the homeless. I ask people for money, then give it away. I 
like that part."

EX-CONGRESSMAN WHO CHOSE PRIESTHOOD STILL ACTIVE AS TEACHER, LIBERAL; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: ROBERT F. DRINAN SHOWS NEITHER PAIN NOR REGRET FOR HIS DECISION. HIS 
FORUM NOW IS THE CLASSROOM AND HIS SUBJECT IS ONE THAT STIRS THE JESUIT JUICES: 
LEGAL ETHICS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago, Pope John Paul II told Father Robert F. Drinan that he must 
choose between the priesthood and serving in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The collar that Drinan still wears speaks of his choice. 
</P>
<P>
In his office at Georgetown University Law Center, Drinan pulls out a thick 
volume of church law and reads aloud: "No priest or nun may hold any office. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
"They changed canon law after my case," he says. "Now, it's very clear. They 
legitimized their preference. It's all spelled out, with long footnotes about 
Drinan." 
</P>
<P>
He sums it up with a bit more bite: 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope threw me out," says Drinan, who is known for espousing liberal causes 
as a U.S. representative from Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5, 1980, Drinan accepted the Pope's order "with regret and pain." 
</P>
<P>
But neither pain nor regret is evident in his chosen role as Drinan the priest. 
Nor is it surprising that he chose a ministry in the Jesuit order, the 
priesthood of intellect. 
</P>
<P>
His forum now is the classroom; his subject is one that confronts conflict, 
challenges certitude and stirs the Jesuit juices: legal ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Drinan greets his 7 p.m. class, seated at desks in seven rows in a large, 
cinder-block room painted blue. Four television sets are suspended from the 
ceiling, but they are silent. 
</P>
<P>
Legal ethics? 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who says that legal ethics is an oxymoron, a contradiction in terms, 
will have to leave the room," Drinan had joked earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Does a lawyer have an obligation to report on his fellow lawyers when he sees 
something wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
He tells of a lawyer in Chicago who was suspended for a year, caught between 
the competing demands of the attorney-client privilege and the obligation to 
report another lawyer's wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there an injustice?" Drinan asks his students. "Should he have gone to 
jail, had his finger cut off, or what?" 
</P>
<P>
Drinan moves out from behind the lectern, paces, hands shoved deep in his 
pockets, continuing in a strong, raspy voice. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lawyer in New York who represents the bad lawyers. He seems to enjoy 
this line of work. Maybe you'll get into legal ethics as a career after this 
midsummer night's dream? 
</P>
<P>
"No?" 
</P>
<P>
Drinan scrawls case citations and legal rules on a blackboard, then selects a 
book from a desk covered with staggered piles of books. He licks his thumb and 
turns a page. 
</P>
<P>
"We now come to a very juicy subject: Should you turn in your brother and 
sister lawyers?" 
</P>
<P>
Drinan interlocks his fingers, pulls them apart, laces them back together. 
</P>
<P>
"What to do? It's not black and white. That's the nature of it." 
</P>
<P>
Drinan's fingers splay up, framing his balding head. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you require every lawyer to have malpractice insurance? There would be a 
whole new wave of litigation. It would bring up more problems than it would 
solve." 
</P>
<P>
Drinan folds his hands on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Confidentiality," he says. "This is the biggie. This is going to haunt you all 
of your life. Lawyer-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"It's based on the theory that somewhere in society there must be secrecy, that 
someone needs a father confessor. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had it for 400 or 500 years, and for 400 or 500 years lots of people 
have been banging on the desk and saying, 'Why do these clowns have this?' " 
Drinan bangs on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute lecture is over. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of his students are repeats," one of them says as they leave the room. 
"He has a real strong following here." 
</P>
<P>
Drinan has never been one to avoid controversy, and he has never lacked a 
following. 
</P>
<P>
He can tick off the activities that drew the Vatican's attention to him: 
Opposition to the war in Vietnam, opposition to the draft, his leadership in 
the abolition of mandatory retirement, his work within the House to abolish the 
Internal Security Committee (formerly the Committee on Un-American Activities). 
</P>
<P>
He mentions his campaign for the release of Soviet activist Natan Sharansky, 
the legislative work on civil liberties, crime, copyright and bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful to have had these opportunities as a moral architect," Drinan 
says. "I can think of no opportunities more worthy of the involvement of a 
priest and a Jesuit." 
</P>
<P>
When he gave up his seat representing Massachusetts' 4th Congressional 
District, he did not give up his voice or abandon his causes. For two years, he 
was president of Americans for Democratic Action, one of the most outspoken 
liberal political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to teaching, he continues to write and speak. 
</P>
<P>
His interest in the ethical conduct of the legal profession led to the founding 
three years ago of the Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics, which has won praise 
as an important source of scholarly ideas and information on the issues that 
lawyers and judges face. 
</P>
<P>
A recent issue included articles on legal malpractice, lawyer advertising and 
whether elected judges should disqualify themselves from cases involving 
campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Drinan, who is the journal's faculty adviser, said: "There has been a 
renaissance of legal ethics in America, and this is the bible." 
</P>
<P>
There is more to the Drinan agenda, and much of it stems from his experience as 
a congressman -- concerning human rights, civil rights, arms control. 
</P>
<P>
He has written three books since leaving Congress. The latest is "Cry of the 
Oppressed -- The History and Hope of the Human Rights Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Drinan takes credit for persuading the American Bar Assn. to endorse the Civil 
Rights Act of 1990. He soon will become chairman of the Bar's committee on 
individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
He has received 20 honorary degrees, 11 of them since he left the House. 
</P>
<P>
What does he miss about Congress? 
</P>
<P>
"I still use the swimming pool," he said. Then he added, with a laugh: "The 
taxpayers pay for the towels. . . . I guess the thing I miss most is the 
parking perks at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
There was, of course, more to Drinan's government career than that. 
</P>
<P>
He was in the thick of the battle to end the war in Vietnam, the issue on which 
he was first elected. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Speaker, I urge all of these people to make war on war," Drinan said in a 
1971 speech. 
</P>
<P>
His congressional papers -- 520 linear feet of them -- are housed at Boston 
College, where he was a law professor and dean of the law school from 1956 
until 1970.

SPOON TELLS TALE OF SUFFERING IN STALINIST CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small silver spoon tells the story of thousands of prisoners who suffered in 
a Siberian labor camp set up under the rule of Josef Stalin in the Soviet Far 
East. 
</P>
<P>
"When I eat, I say nothing and hear nothing," reads an inscription scratched on 
the spoon, found amid a cluster of brick barracks and wooden crosses in a 
graveyard in the camp. It was signed with the name Volkov. 
</P>
<P>
A recent visit to the camp, the first by foreign journalists, revealed 
conditions perhaps even worse than those described in the acclaimed works of 
Varlaam Shalamov and Eugenia Ginzburg, who endured the notorious Kolyma camps 
in Northern Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
Located at the tip of the continent about 50 miles outside Pevek, the camp was 
given the name Severny, the Russian word for northern. 
</P>
<P>
Even prisoners who managed to survive a starvation diet of bread and water, 
died from exposure to temperatures reaching almost 100 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Set on a mountain overlooking the Arctic Ocean, the camp is an intimidating 
illustration of naked human power and cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
A path still remains where emaciated prisoners assigned to work in a uranium 
mine were forced to climb an enormous stairway each day. The stairway connected 
a lower camp, where the mine was located, to an upper camp where the prisoners 
slept, at about 3,900 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it would have made more sense to have the prisoners sleep near the 
mine, the authorities feared they would escape, so they made them live high 
atop the mountain," said Nikolai Vasiliyev, a geologist who is studying the 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
From 1950 to 1960, the years Severny was believed to have operated, about 
20,000 political and criminal prisoners lived there at one time. Most survived 
an average of only two to four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Severny camp is considered perhaps the most extreme example of human horror 
established during the Stalin period -- a time of purges, show trials, 
fabricated plots, executions and mass exile. 
</P>
<P>
No precise figure has been placed on how many people perished in camps 
throughout the Soviet Union. Western historian Robert Conquest has estimated 
that 20 million to 40 million people died between the early 1930s and the 
1950s. Stalin died in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to destroy the Stalin legacy have prompted a public crusade in Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
It began in 1986, after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost 
lifted a shroud of secrecy that had surrounded the reviled dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the port of Magadan, a city in Siberia built with prison labor and used 
as a depot for dispatching prisoners farther north, an organized effort is 
under way to identify camp survivors and to learn about camp history. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is being inspired in part by some camp survivors who settled in 
Magadan when their exile ended. 
</P>
<P>
Asir Sandler, 72, a former prisoner who was transported thousands of miles by 
train for a decade in camps in Azerbaijan, the Ural Mountains, the Far East and 
Siberia, tried to live in Moscow after his exile. But he found people were 
intolerant of his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole life is shaped by the camps, so I decided to return to Magadan," said 
Sandler, a spirited man who had been sentenced to death, but wrote a plea for 
mercy and had his sentence commuted to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even for some Magadan residents who were never prisoners, the camps are carved 
into their childhood memories. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a camp near our house," recalled David Reisman, 49, who was born in 
Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
"We would throw bread and cigarettes through the barbed wire for the prisoners 
and they would throw us toys. Then the guards would shoot into the air to scare 
us away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial, a national grass-roots organization with a chapter in Magadan, has 
identified at least 100 camp sites stretching from Magadan into the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
A map of the suspected sites hangs in one corner of Magadan's Pushkin Library. 
When survivors from across the Soviet Union come to the library, they are asked 
to indicate the location of where they were sentenced during the great purges. 
</P>
<P>
"We know so little about what happened even though Magadan was where thousands 
of prisoners marched through the streets," said Meron Atlis, a camp survivor 
and president of the local Memorial chapter. 
</P>
<P>
The group is planning to build a monument this year on the mountaintop at 
Pevek. A larger memorial complex is scheduled for Magadan, where a small 
monument now stands in the town's central square. 
</P>
<P>
Many camp survivors and their relatives are concentrating their search for the 
missing pieces to the labor camp puzzle in the Kolyma region. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the forced labor camps during the Stalin era, Kolyma stood out not only 
for its cruel regime, but also for its high mortality rate. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners were forced to walk more than 250 miles in bone-chilling temperatures 
to the Kolyma camps from Magadan -- a 14-hour journey by car. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to a camp on the notorious Kolyma peninsula, the only 
visible remains were brick barracks, barbed wire and rusted tin cups. 
</P>
<P>
Camp survivors such as Alexandra Popova, 49, who was born inside the wire, the 
daughter of a prisoner, believes the state has not done enough for Stalin's 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Gorbachev reforms permitting such groups as Memorial, Popova, who 
spent part of her childhood in Kolyma, wants compensation for the lost years. 
</P>
<P>
"Social justice is not yet here," she said.

<P>
Cowbells tinkle and the wooden chalets are smothered in flowers. An occasional 
alpenhorn echoes in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
This indeed is folklore Switzerland, where men yodel and women wear traditional 
costumes as part of everyday country life. 
</P>
<P>
So tourists can hardly know of the rumblings below the peaceful and picturesque 
surface in Appenzell-Inner Rhodes. This miniature canton, or state, in the top 
northeast corner of the country is the last bastion of Swiss male domination, 
where women still cannot vote in local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them are angry because they are denied their constitutional rights and 
-- perhaps worse -- made to look ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
It is also thought that Switzerland's highest court will equivocate in ruling 
later this year on a complaint of violating equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Appenzell is nothing more than a Disneyland," stormed artist Roswitha Doerig. 
"Tradition which ignores people's rights is bad tradition. Women who don't care 
are merely being coquettish." 
</P>
<P>
True enough, a lot of Appenzell women don't give a hoot and are very happy to 
stay out of the way and let the men play politics. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in 1971 that Swiss men, in a national referendum, accepted female 
suffrage in federal matters. It already existed on local issues in some of the 
26 cantons and others quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
Not, however, the ultra-traditional "half-cantons" of Protestant 
Appenzell-Outer Rhodes and Catholic Appenzell-Inner Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1989, the men of Appenzell-Outer Rhodes (population 51,100) bowed 
to a high court ruling on equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
But the men stood firm in Appenzell-Inner Rhodes, which has 13,700 people and 
is 66 square miles, about the size of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
This year -- and for the third time -- they refused to give the 5,000 or so 
women of voting age a say in community affairs. With the traditional show of 
male hands in the town square, the proposal was defeated by a ratio of about 3 
to 2. 
</P>
<P>
The more militant women were outraged. They had, after all, used previously 
unimaginable measures: kitchen strikes, bedroom boycotts, even returning local 
tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm paying my taxes to another canton where women at least have a say in how 
taxes are calculated," said economist Monika Jacober. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, Dagmar Hersche, was more outspoken: "Are we women supposed to be 
children? What would men do without a woman at home? Without teachers? These 
men are not patriots. They're schizophrenic idiots." 
</P>
<P>
For centuries local men have decided important local issues -- usually the 
expenditure of money on public works -- at a Landsgemeinde or community 
gathering every two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
A woman at the tourist office, who asked to remain unidentified, said recently 
that an extraordinary second Landsgemeinde may be held this year because of all 
the unrest and a pending new court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"But things look bad because it must be convened by our local government," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She was right. In July, the Christian Democratic People's Party, which runs 
Appenzell-Inner Rhodes, rejected having another show of hands in the town 
square. 
</P>
<P>
"Lamentable," scoffed Christine Langenberger-Jaeger. "The right of women to 
vote is not a political issue. It is a constitutional issue." 
</P>
<P>
Langenberger-Jaeger, a former president of the Swiss Women's Rights Assn., is 
also pessimistic about its complaint to the high court. 
</P>
<P>
"Cantonal rights come above all else in Switzerland. The Supreme Court, and far 
less the federal government, cannot force a canton to do something," she said. 
"And the Supreme Court has not even indicated when it may hand down a ruling." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, there is a widely held feeling that the justices will hedge -- 
saying that although the Constitution calls for equal rights, it also gives 
citizens the final say. 
</P>
<P>
It has made a philosopher of Georgette Wachter, the secretary of the Women's 
Rights Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't pleasant to be the last women in the developed world without voting 
rights locally, although it is true we can vote in national elections," she 
said. "That makes us like women in some of the Arab emirates who have nothing 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'll live with it. After all, we've been fighting for a long time, and 
sooner or later the men will have to give in."

CHINA PURSUES 'RENT-A-PANDA' DIPLOMACY

<P>
Despite appeals by environmentalists, China is pressing ahead with its 
"rent-a-panda" diplomacy by sending the endangered animals to zoos around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Two giant pandas will be flown to Singapore in October and placed on display 
for three months. 
</P>
<P>
China Wildlife Conservation Assn. official Song Huigang defended the policy and 
angrily denounced attempts by the World Wide Fund for Nature to stop the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 1,000 pandas are believed to survive in China, according to a recent 
estimate by a leading Chinese zoologist who said the population is being 
ravaged by illegal hunting and a deteriorating environment. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the bearlike creatures from extinction China stopped giving pandas 
to other countries in 1985, after donating more than 20 to foreign zoos. 
</P>
<P>
But the "rent-a-panda" business has never ceased and earns valuable hard 
currency for China. 
</P>
<P>
A 100-day loan of an animal costs more than $400,000, foreign sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question of a price," said a second official of the Chinese 
conservation association. "But we welcome a donation." 
</P>
<P>
China said the money is spent protecting pandas. 
</P>
<P>
When Australia rented two pandas in 1988 after Prime Minister Bob Hawke cuddled 
one in a Chinese zoo, the "donation" amounted to several hundred thousand 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as a free panda," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Wide Fund for Nature, which has adopted the panda as its symbol, is 
opposed to flying pandas around the world because they are an endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no right to interfere in China's affairs," Song said. 
</P>
<P>
"They use our panda as their emblem and have raised $20 million," he said. "But 
only $2 million of the money is put to use in China's panda rescue efforts." 
</P>
<P>
China said large sums have been spent on saving the animals, which are found 
only in China, and smugglers and hunters caught trading in their have been 
executed.

JOBLESSNESS HITS A 2-YEAR HIGH; RECESSION IS FEARED

The nation's unemployment rate shot up to 5.5% last month, its highest level in 
two years, the government said Friday in a report renewing fears that the 
economy may be toppling into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy appears to be caving in to a full-fledged recession. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in the unemployment rate is the telling sign," said Allen Sinai, chief 
economist at the Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, the stock market sold off sharply amid the new recession fears 
and Middle East oil concerns. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 
more than 120 points at its midsession low, closed with a 54.95-point loss at 
2,809.65. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's unemployment report showed widespread weakness in the 
job market as payrolls fell by 219,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
That number was bloated by the 160,000 temporary census workers the government 
laid off, but other sectors of the economy posted job losses too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one more nail in the coffin of the economic boon. . . . It's pretty clear 
evidence the economy is in big trouble," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist of 
Manufacturers Hanover Trust. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration interpreted the numbers differently. Spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said the report "does reinforce our concern for getting the deficit 
under control" but said the economy is still growing. "We don't see a 
recession," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the 
U.S. economy "is not going to hang on much longer."

VOTING RIGHTS LAW: 25 YEARS OF CHANGE

<P>
Looking back to his college days 25 years ago, Roy Terry -- now a clothing 
manufacturer -- recalls vividly the one thing that separated him from the white 
students in Atlanta, where he attended Morehouse College. 
</P>
<P>
The whites could vote; 75% of American blacks couldn't vote, and he was one. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Aug. 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, 
banning literacy tests, poll taxes, and other methods used to discourage blacks 
from voting. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing we have gained from the Voting Rights Act is more leverage, more 
elected black officials," Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
Giving blacks the right to vote prompted politicians to establish special 
programs so that blacks would have more opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Terry was one of those who benefited. Not only could he vote, his family's 
business improved its annual income, from about $100,000 in 1963 to more than 
$12 million, helped by government contracts to supply military camouflage and 
firefighters' uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Minority purchasing goals . . . that we participated in have been a benefit of 
the Voting Rights Act," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
On the 25th anniversary of the law, more than 7,000 blacks hold elective local, 
state or federal offices, but the votes to put them there were not always easy 
to cast. 
</P>
<P>
Some enthusiastic blacks traveled hundreds of miles to register, only to be met 
with violence. 
</P>
<P>
"There was resentment that black people could participate in the process," 
former Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York, the first black woman to serve in 
Congress, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Battles emerged at voting places, especially in the South, and often, polls 
were not located so that they were accessible for everyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chisholm, a Democrat, was elected to the House in 1969 and served until 1982. 
She remembers the early days when Congress was run by "old line, diehard, white 
Southerners." 
</P>
<P>
"There was always a battle about color, making sure appropriations would be 
allocated fairly. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically every piece of legislation required an amendment to specifically 
include women and blacks. It seemed ironic that in a democracy, we had to put 
in amendments to see that blacks and women wouldn't get left out." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly and steadily, white candidates, especially those in the South, had come 
to grips with a new thrust in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks were running for office, and if they didn't win, they could decide who 
would. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, 25 years after the law was enacted, many blacks still think it has not 
carried them far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Historians and political scientists say that blacks do not feel totally at home 
in either the Republican or Democratic party, and often prefer to place all 
their faith in black politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they are naive, Mary Frances Berry, a member of the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights, suggested. Black politicians must consider not just the black 
voter, they are beholden to all their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"Many blacks thought the problems of race, economics and social conditions 
would be solved with the vote," said Berry, "but when the kingdom was still 
closed after people got the key, they said, 'doesn't that mean we shouldn't 
vote?' " 
</P>
<P>
Berry said that more effort might be focused on peaceful demonstrations for 
change such as those that have forced several U.S. corporations to sell their 
holdings in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians say there are signs that the process begun 25 years ago will 
continue to gather strength. 
</P>
<P>
On the South Africa question, black sensitivity has registered with President 
Bush and a Republican Party that is campaigning to woo African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are united in our opposition to apartheid," the President told magazine 
publishers recently.

NORWAY'S LAPPS STRUGGLE WITH REINDEER BOOM; 
</P>

NATURE: THE HERDS ARE THREATENING THE LOCAL ECOLOGY BY EATING TOO MUCH MOSS AND 
OTHER VEGETATION. ONE POSSIBILITY IS A TAX ON THOSE HAVING MORE THAN NEEDED TO 
SUPPORT A FAMILY.

KARASJOK, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norway's Lapps, struggling to maintain their ancient Arctic traditions of 
fishing and reindeer herding, have an unexpected problem -- a reindeer 
population boom. 
</P>
<P>
"We have too many reindeer," said Kjell Saether, mayor of Karasjok, a town set 
among amid stunted pine and birch trees where temperatures can plunge to 60 
degrees below zero in the permanent winter darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Lapps, the biggest grouping of a semi-nomadic people who also 
live in Finland, the Soviet Union and Sweden, have around 200,000 reindeer. The 
herds are threatening the local ecology by eating too much moss and other 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there have never been so many. The numbers are too high for nature to 
support," Saether said. "The authorities say there should be around 160,000." 
</P>
<P>
The reindeer population explosion, partly due to Lapps building up herds in the 
hope of higher prices, is the opposite of problems faced by many others in the 
north of Norway, where fish stocks have plunged and many industries have 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The Lapps, who speak a language related to Finnish and have lived in the barren 
Arctic for at least 2,000 years, want to avoid a major kill that might further 
depress reindeer prices. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility is a tax on having more reindeer than needed to support a 
family -- about 400 to 500 animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people herding reindeer have very many reindeer. We've been speaking 
about how to get more equal numbers," said Per Edvard Klemetsen, administrator 
of the Lapps' 39-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Despite reindeer overpopulation, rivalries among Lapps mean that hundreds of 
reindeer get stolen -- sometimes vanishing over the nearby Finnish border in a 
blizzard in the winter dark. 
</P>
<P>
Saether said there were reports that 250 stolen reindeer had been recently 
found dead with their ears cut off. 
</P>
<P>
Reindeer ownership is shown by marks on the ears rather than by brands on the 
body, and it can get confused when herds meet. Slicing off ears is an easy way 
of concealing ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The Lapps, small, dark-skinned people who prefer to be known as Samis, are also 
trying to expand markets for reindeer. "We've not been clever at marketing," 
Saether said. 
</P>
<P>
A reindeer costs between $185 and $230. Reindeer meat is a common dish in 
Scandinavia, and dried heart is a Lapp specialty. Hides are sold as rugs or 
blankets, horns are carved into souvenirs such as knife handles. 
</P>
<P>
Japan buys large amounts of reindeer horn and grinds it into powder. In Japan a 
small amount under the tongue is believed to be an aphrodisiac. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never tried it," said Saether, wearing a traditional embroidered blue, 
red and gold Sami tunic. 
</P>
<P>
Even though only 5% to 10% of Lapps are directly involved in traditional 
reindeer herding, often camping out in tents made of hides, the Lapps are 
trying to expand their other activities, such as tourism, farming and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
In Karasjok, the center of the Lapp culture in Norway, a $6 million center for 
visitors is due to open this summer, with a hotel and stores for local foods 
and handicrafts. About 120,000 people visit Karasjok every year. 
</P>
<P>
Most Lapps have forsaken traditional tents for the wooden houses typical of 
Norwegians in northern Norway while herdsmen have given up sleds for 
snowmobiles. Most wear jeans and sweaters instead of traditional dress. 
</P>
<P>
The gradual opening of the Soviet border, a boundary that the Lapps never 
recognized, also means that the Lapps can visit their cousins in the Soviet 
Union -- and perhaps find new markets. Norway's Lapps produce a surplus of farm 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Lapps also want to study pollution from the Soviet Union, especially two 
nickel factories -- which might be more to blame than the reindeer for 
stripping vegetation in the fragile Arctic environment. 
</P>
<P>
Saether said the Lapps' reindeer largely escaped the effects of the Chernobyl 
nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986, which sent a cloud of radiation 
farther south over Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
The Lapps say they feel more accepted in Norway after their own Parliament 
opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lapps were not allowed to speak their own language in school until 1950 and did 
not have the right to own land in northern Norway until 1965. Generations of 
missionaries tried, sometimes with violence, to convert them to Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
Like many in northern Norway, the Lapps receive subsidies. Klemetsen said these 
totalled $5.1 million this year. Lapps reckon that they could probably get by 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
Their hardiness is legendary. One local joke says that the temperature in 
Karasjok one winter day plunged close to record lows. 
</P>
<P>
A journalist from Oslo telephoned a Sami woman in Karasjok and asked how cold 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 14 degrees below zero," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 14? I'd heard it was more than 50 below." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh well, yes, but that's outdoors."

FUTURE BLEAK FOR VIET OVERSEAS WORKERS

<P>
The revolution in Eastern Europe has transformed the 180,000 Vietnamese working 
there from fraternal socialist guests to economic liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in the Soviet Union and its former satellites have exposed state 
enterprises to cost accounting and Western competition, which has meant 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Most Vietnamese contract workers employed under decade-old "labor cooperation" 
agreements will be repatriated in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Their return is expected to exacerbate the unemployment problem in Vietnam, 
which recently demobilized tens of thousands of soldiers who had served in 
Cambodia and on the Chinese border. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of other people lost their jobs after Vietnam streamlined its own 
state companies with reforms similar to those in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Returning workers, diplomats and press reports say people vying for jobs and 
basic goods in Eastern Europe have protested the presence of the Vietnamese, 
sometimes with violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets look down on the Vietnamese people and sometimes the bad ones even 
attack us," said Nguyen Ngoc Vy, 30, who returned recently from Moscow. "I was 
afraid of being attacked and killed by the Soviet hooligans." 
</P>
<P>
Vy said fear was one reason he came home two years before the end of his 
contract at an automobile plant. He and other Vietnamese went abroad in hope of 
earning more money and buying consumer goods, but found the shelves empty in 
Moscow stores. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam stopped sending workers abroad in January, after talks with host 
countries, said Tran Luc, head of the Labor Ministry's international relations 
department. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany, which has about 60,000 Vietnamese workers, and Czechoslovakia, 
with about 14,000, have said all will be gone by 1994-95, when their contracts 
expire. Bulgaria says all 24,000 of its Vietnamese will be gone by 1992, before 
their contracts expire. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, which has about 81,000 Vietnamese, will continue its program 
for now but probably will reduce the number greatly, said Anatoly Voronine of 
the Soviet Embassy. He said the Soviets need workers in certain regions and 
industries, and to produce more consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese who work abroad have contracts of four to six years, generally for 
jobs in light industry or building construction. Part of each salary goes to 
repay Vietnam's large debts to the host countries. 
</P>
<P>
The labor pacts were signed in 1980 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally this was not conceived as a purely economic transaction, but . . . 
chiefly as an act of cooperation in the fraternal and friendly spirit among 
socialist countries," Labor Minister Tran Dinh Hoan said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological bonds have loosened or disappeared, however, and economic 
considerations now dominate. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, "skinheads and punks" taking advantage of the freer 
atmosphere have attacked and injured Vietnamese, said Josef Hanculak, charge 
d'affaires of the Czechoslovak Embassy. To protect the Vietnamese, he said, 
factories had to provide buses to take them to and from work. 
</P>

Vietnamese in Bulgaria have been "manhandled by hooligans on whom the Bulgarian 
police turn a blind eye," a correspondent of Hanoi radio reported after a visit 
in April. In one housing complex, he said, about 700 Vietnamese lived for years 
without electricity or running water. 
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted a Soviet government official, Viktor Buynovsky, as saying: 
"Five years ago, if a Vietnamese worker was seen carrying large quantities of 
pans or electric irons, Soviets would laugh. But now, when everything is 
scarce, this irks our people." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has put blame on some of the workers. Last year, the radio said, 
authorities disciplined 20% of "labor management cadres" who worked abroad and 
were involved in "negative phenomena." 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Eastern Europe say some Vietnamese have formed groups to engage in 
black market dealings, currency speculation and prostitution.

KIDNAPING AND EXTORTION SOAR IN TAIWAN 
</P>

TAIPEI, Taiwan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A doctor gives up parking his Mercedes-Benz near his Taipei home and leaves his 
beat-up Citroen in front instead to throw off potential extortionists. 
</P>
<P>
The president of a Taipei securities firm who used to do the rounds of business 
dinners now avoids going out whenever possible. His colleague down the street, 
meanwhile, has hired security guards to escort him to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
Crime has arrived in full force in Taiwan in recent years, fueled by the 
lifting of martial law and the fast growth of a wealthy class. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very serious problem," said legislator Gary Wang, who was forced to pay 
$185,000 to extortionists during his campaign last December. "If we don't take 
action, Taiwan could become like Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
The last seven months of 1989 saw more than 3,200 violent crimes, a leap of 25% 
over the same period last year, according to police. Kidnapings alone were up 
53% last year. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of crimes consist of kidnapings and extortion of well-to-do 
businessmen, many of whom have taken to hiring bodyguards and trading in their 
imported cars for less flashy models. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales of high-class imported cars fell by as much as 50% last year," said Paul 
Lin, a dealer for BMW. "Our customers come in and say they're afraid of being 
extorted." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most publicized cases, the chairman of the giant Evergreen 
shipping company, Wang Yung-ching, last year shelled out almost $2 million to 
ransom his abducted 32-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Ministry of Economic Affairs shows that more than 
one-third of small and medium enterprises have been extorted or harassed by 
gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been threatened eight times," said Liu Shen-chu, executive officer of 
TenRen Tea Co. "It's the same with other big companies." 
</P>
<P>
Officials attribute the skyrocketing crime rate to a liberalization of society 
following the lifting of martial law in 1987 after nearly 40 years and to the 
growing wealth gap. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years of hard work and savings have vaulted Taiwan into the ranks of 
world economic powers, holding $69 billion in foreign exchange reserves and 
ranked 13th among trading nations. 
</P>
<P>
Rampant speculation in stocks and real estate over the last two years has 
resulted in the formation of a new wealthy class eager to spend its money on 
status items. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy fancy clothes and drive imported cars," said Chang Chin-heng, 
director of the investigation division at the National Police Administration. 
"Those without money see them and want them too." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to do and buy, but you can't do any of it if you don't have 
money," said a 20-year-old man sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnaping a 
10-year-old child. "So you turn to doing bad because it's the easiest way to 
make money." 
</P>
<P>
Since the lifting of martial law, the number of smuggled guns, especially those 
from China, has risen dramatically in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Police seized 687 Chinese-made shotguns last year, up sharply from 57 in 1988. 
Such guns were used to kill 111 people last year, according to official 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The government has launched an anti-crime campaign led by Premier Hau Pei-tsun, 
a former four-star general with a tough reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is definitely improving since Premier Hau took office," said 
George Chang, assistant vice president of a local construction company that 
used to receive an average of four or five extortion threats for each building 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But it may take more than official muscle to check the crime rate. Rapid 
industrialization has unraveled Taiwan's basic social unit, the family, as both 
parents in most households work and children move to the city to find better 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Essential informal social controls are being destroyed as everyone chases 
after money," said Sheu Cheun-jim of the Central Police College. "There's 
nothing left to take their place."

QUAKE PROJECTIONS ARE ON SHAKY GROUND, SOME SAY

Iben Browning holds dozens of patents in several specialties, but it's his 
earthquake projections that are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do 
without. 
</P>
<P>
Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a high 
probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
He was deluged by calls. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he did not predict an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The public always wants everything in black and white," Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on Dec. 2, no one can 
know that. . . . Everybody knows when he drives a car that he's taking a risk 
that it will malfunction or crash. Yet people do drive cars. They're dealing in 
probabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Browning, 72, a large man with a graying burr haircut, says the public does not 
understand -- and the press does not know how to communicate -- the idea of 
probability. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest you can translate probability into English is 'maybe.' But unless 
you say 'maybe not,' they take it as an absolute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, who publishes the Browning Newsletter on world climate, said his 
climatological observations are based on high tidal forces produced by four 
causes: the proximity of the moon to Earth; the proximity of Earth to the sun; 
the alignment of the Earth, moon and sun during the full moon and new moon; and 
the more perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses. These factors 
combine to produce tidal forces. 
</P>
<P>
The same forces can trigger earthquakes, he said, and on Dec. 2, there will be 
the highest combination of such factors in 60 years from 30 degrees to 60 
degrees north latitude. That area includes the New Madrid Fault, running 
roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through New Madrid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, when Browning raised the possibility of a December New Madrid 
quake, the Arkansas National Guard has scheduled earthquake exercises for 
around that time, one Arkansas school district is considering canceling classes 
and sales of earthquake insurance have picked up. 
</P>
<P>
But Browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered would depend on 
the pressure built up along it. That information should come from area 
seismologists, he said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
If no earthquake occurs in or around December, Browning said people will be 
more inclined to ignore the danger of the New Madrid Fault. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I fear more than anything else," he said. "People don't trust 
authorities anymore; they never did trust them much. Why should they? What have 
authorities done for them except tax them to death?" 
</P>
<P>
Browning's earthquake projections are controversial among seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Jacob, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory 
of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y., said correlating earthquakes to 
tidal forces doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years we'll have something 
(quake activity), rather than on this particular day," Jacob said. "You see, 
earthquakes don't care about predictions. And people shouldn't worry about 
predictions. They should worry about earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers in San Francisco 
on Oct. 10, 1989, that there was a 50-50 chance of an earthquake registering 7 
on the Richter scale on or about Oct. 16 because a high triggering force was 
expected that date and geologists had determined there was a strain on the San 
Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake registering 7.1 hit Oct. 17, killing 67 people. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob said: "He was just lucky. That's the law of large numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information 
at Memphis State University in Tennessee, said Browning "is certainly not 
justified scientifically." 
</P>
<P>
"The tidal force that Dr. Browning bases his theory on has been examined 
thoroughly by seismologists, and there's no evidence that tidal forces can 
trigger earthquakes. . . . Earthquakes depend on the internal processes of the 
Earth, not the external processes of the sun and moon." 
</P>
<P>
Browning is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an Albuquerque 
biotechnology research and development company. His Summa resume says he holds 
66 U.S. and foreign patents in optics, electronics, mechanics, chemistry, 
electrooptics, hydraulics and educational toys. 
</P>
<P>
Summa credits him -- he won't discuss what he does for the company -- with 
developing new technology for compressing electronically transmitted human 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he has been a development physicist with American Optical Co., 
worked in optics for Bell Aircraft Corp. and was a scientist for Sandia 
National Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually his interest in climatology grew. He said he has been accepted 
commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he became a consultant for 
Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
His formal training was elsewhere: a bachelor's degree in math and physics from 
Southwest Texas State University, and a master's degree in bacteriology 
physiology and a doctorate in physiology, genetics and bacteriology from the 
University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that in my observations of climate that all of the soft tools 
with which I approached biology were applicable to climate," he said. "It's a 
subject that is comparable in complexity to biology." 
</P>
<P>
Business needs climate information because the weather determines how much food 
will be produced and where, whether the transportation industry can get over 
the roads, whether anything can be built, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the Rocky Mountain Almanac and 
"did as well or better than the Old Farmers' Almanac predictions," said Lee 
Olson, almanac editor. 
</P>
<P>
"He did predict the usual monsoons that come up in Arizona in late August, that 
the Colorado Great Plains would receive extra moisture and store up adequate 
moisture for the 1990 year," Olson said. "He had the ski season only partly. He 
had it right for an early start, but it got dry around Christmas as I recall 
and his timing was a little off on that."

IS JDL'S NEW PATROL REALLY A NEW DAWN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While reading David Haldane's article on Irv Rubin and the Jewish Defense 
League ("JDL's New Patrol," July 23), I found myself recalling a warm morning 
in May when I was introduced rather abruptly to Rubin and his style of public 
demonstration. I was immediately put off and was ready to throw the 
Constitution, and the First Amendment in particular, to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
I will never forget that day for many reasons. What an honor it was to be the 
First Crucifier, an acolyte, serving in the same service as one of the most 
humble and gracious servants in the world -- South African Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu. I was proud, joyful, and in complete awe of this man, who risks his life 
to battle oppression and hatred among the human family and has been duly 
recognized for his peacemaking efforts by no less an authority than the Nobel 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
As the acolytes, banners, flags, choir and clergy recessed from the nave of All 
Saints Episcopal Church onto the streets of Pasadena, the throng of people 
outside applauded and cheered in a show of respect and love. 
</P>
<P>
As their esteemed visitor passed them, glory and grace turned to fear and 
ugliness. The two other acolytes and I were shoved out of the way. Rubin and 
his colleagues were shouting and verbally accosting Archbishop Tutu in a very 
threatening manner, hissing, "What about the Jews, Tutu?" . . . "Jew Hater!" . 
. . and much worse. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being able to greet the eager congregation, the archbishop was 
quickly escorted to a safer place. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the JDL's reputation is thwarting the effectiveness of other 
respectable Jewish advocacy groups, yet JDL fills a void as well. There must be 
found, in this situation, a medium for passionate expression in a civilized 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin and the Jewish Defense League caused a great deal of nervousness and 
disappointment among the congregation and the people in charge of the service. 
However, with the gracious and kind manner in which Archbishop Tutu deals with 
situations, even in the face of threat and harsh words, he presented himself as 
such a man again, saying: "That is all right . . . in my country they would not 
be allowed such a freedom . . . I understand their frustration." 
</P>
<P>
It is to Rubin's credit that attempts at reconciliation have been made by him 
if they are, in fact, genuine. I hope that others are as forgiving and 
understanding as Archbishop Tutu.

'ROAD GANGS' ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "On the Road Gang," July 22): I was most impressed. 
</P>
<P>
For years I have wondered why the various governmental agencies have failed to 
take advantage of incarcerated individuals and put them to work on something 
that needed to be done in the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
Your article demonstrated that someone is really taking advantage of a resource 
and applying it to a public need. The best part is that those doing the work 
are more than impressed that they don't want a repeat of the sentence. They're 
reminded of it many times a day for many days, as they are grubbing in weeds, 
picking up trash and using the portable johns.

A BRIDGE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Bridge Between Two Worlds" (June 17) is a commendable account of Jack West, 
the person chosen to head the new American Indian Museum planned to be built in 
Washington D.C. Mr. West has an amazingly strong background, and I admire his 
strength and endurance as an attorney who defends Indian issues in Washington. 
Being half Indian and half Anglo, he has the ability to bridge both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
I find the fact that the museum will be called "American Indian Museum" has a 
demeaning effect. It should be called the "Native American Museum." This title 
would give a more concrete statement to the American public. After all, Native 
Americans were here for centuries before "settlers," and hasn't that been the 
catalyst of their struggle all along? 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how this museum will serve those it intends to honor? Will it help the 
Sioux Indians in South Dakota get decent water to drink on their reservation? 
Will it help living conditions improve on any of the impoverished reservations 
in this country? It is about time something is being done to improve the image 
of one of the longest-standing one-with-nature cultures ever to exist on this 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
I am an educator working in vocational education for child-care occupations. I 
have seen very little quality curriculum that presents Native Americans with 
respect. I am working to do what I can. I hope this rebuttal to the article 
will stimulate other educators to improve the image they are presenting to 
their students when it comes to Native Americans.

MALATHION BLAMED FOR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kathleen Doheny's column "Your Body: It's a Mean Season for Breathing" 
describes an increase in coughs and upper respiratory problems this summer. 
Apparently, no one has determined the cause of this increase. 
</P>
<P>
What environmental conditions are different this summer, as compared to 
previous summers? The first thing that comes to mind is the state's incessant 
aerial spraying of malathion and sugary bait. Although we were assured at one 
time that malathion would not hurt us, the state has so far exceeded its 
liberal standards for safety by continuing the sprayings beyond original 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a correlation between the sprayings and the increase in respiratory 
infections (which include pneumonia)? Is the aerial spraying one of the factors 
contributing to these infections?

'BLACK DRAGON' -- SECRETIVE ASIAN GANG TRACES TO ALIENATED VIET REFUGEES OF 
'70S; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SOME WERE PUNKS. SOME WERE TORN BETWEEN CULTURES. POLICE SAY THEIR 
ACTIVITIES HAVE MOVED BEYOND PETTY THEFT TO EXTORTION, BURGLARIES AND 
ROBBERIES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the early 1980s, when Southeast Asian gangs were still in their 
infancy, Los Angeles Police Department Detective William Park remembers 
street-wise Vietnamese boys taunting, "New Wave never ends." 
</P>
<P>
It was partly a reference to their rebellious look: long spiked hair, baggy 
black pants and white shirts buttoned to the collar. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also a macho slogan, Park believed, meant to say that the tough 
refugee youths and their secretive, loosely knit alliances would not be easily 
quashed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like they were saying . . . you couldn't take them down," recalled 
Park, an investigator in the Police Department's Asian Crimes Section. "You put 
them away, but there's always going to be younger blood taking their place. It 
never ends." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a decade later, it hasn't. Police say those same teen-agers grew up to 
be the core of a gang known today as "Black Dragon," a group of mostly ethnic 
Chinese refugees from Vietnam who are thought to be responsible for dozens of 
armed robberies in Asian communities throughout the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On July 24, after months of surveillance, police arrested 18 suspected members 
of the gang, whose total membership may range from 40 to 100, according to 
various law enforcement estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of their alleged victims have been reluctant to come forward, 
however, 13 of the suspects had to be released for lack of evidence, officers 
said. Of the five who remain in custody -- each in lieu of $300,000 bail -- 
four were charged with robbery and kidnaping in connection with a heist at a 
San Gabriel beauty parlor. The fifth was charged in connection with a similar 
holdup at a salon near Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference after the arrests, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman 
Block asked for the Asian community's help in identifying the suspects and 
tying them to more crimes. He said gangs such as Black Dragon prey on 
immigrants' fears of retaliation, their unfamiliarity with the U.S. legal 
system and a tendency to write off such assaults as merely bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asian victim is least likely to come forward and report their 
victimization," said Block, whose department teamed up with six other police 
agencies to make the arrests. "That's the kind of thing we're trying to break 
through." 
</P>
<P>
But leaders in the San Gabriel Valley's Asian communities said last week that 
cooperation with police will come only after a long educational process, 
including frequent patrols, neighborhood meetings and the hiring of more 
officers who speak some of their 42 dialects. 
</P>
<P>
"I always encourage people to cooperate with police, but many are afraid of 
revenge," said David Ma, who runs an immigration law and consulting firm in 
Monterey Park. "They're skeptical that the police can protect them. They think, 
if the police can protect them, then why are there so many of these robberies 
happening?" 
</P>
<P>
According to police and probation officers, the early members of Black Dragon 
came to this country in the late 1970s as junior high school students -- poor 
teen-agers who spent their free time stealing car stereos in the neighborhoods 
north of Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Southeast Asian gangs, their alliances were fluid. Three or four of 
them might meet one day at a pool hall or over a hot bowl of the traditional 
Vietnamese soup, Pho, and agree to join forces in a burglary or auto theft, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Some displayed cigarette burns on their wrists -- supposed symbols of their 
immunity to pain -- while others wore tattoos bearing the images of tigers, 
eagles and dragons. "They were just street-level punks," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them were also probably lost, confused young men torn between two 
cultures, say mental-health experts and school officials who have worked with 
Southeast Asian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Such gang members, they said, arrive here in their early teens, their 
educations disrupted, their families fragmented, and their aspirations replaced 
by feelings of rootlessness and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the youths speak Cantonese or Vietnamese with their parents, many of 
whom are former farmers or fishermen with often conservative and restrictive 
ideas of how their children should behave. Out on the streets, they encounter 
an English-speaking world that glorifies power and material wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"They want very much to be like American kids," said May To, program 
coordinator at the Asian Youth Center in Monterey Park. "But that usually means 
money to go to a dance or out for a drink -- money that their parents don't 
have, or if they do, they won't allow them to use in those ways." 
</P>
<P>
Unprepared for those conflicts, some of the most disaffected take their chances 
with crime, psychologists and social workers say. As the members of Black 
Dragon reached their 20s, however, they gradually developed into what police 
now consider one of the largest and most active Asian gangs in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Petty theft gave way to extortion, commercial burglary and home-invasion 
robberies, officers say. Victims were routinely bound with duct tape, 
electrical cords and clothes hangers. The uncooperative were beaten, 
pistol-whipped and tortured. 
</P>
<P>
"They became very organized and very dangerous," said Christopher Kuk, a 
probation officer in the county's Asian Gang Unit. "If they see you as a threat 
to their well-being, they will not hesitate to remove you from the face of this 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
Their name is not well-known in the immigrant communities of Alhambra, San 
Gabriel or Monterey Park, largely because they operate furtively and do not 
promote the indentity of the gang, police say. Often, they will skip town to 
commit crimes in other cities with sizable Vietnamese populations, such as 
Boston, Houston, San Jose and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, recalled Steve Kornfeld, dean of students at San Gabriel 
High School, a young Vietnamese student approached him and pointed to 
Kornfeld's aging Seiko wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Your watch is no good," the boy said, flashing a fancy gold timepiece that 
Kornfeld figured cost more than $1,500. When Kornfeld asked the youth where he 
got his watch, he remembers him saying, "You get on a plane, go away two days 
and come back and you have a nice watch. It's easy." 
</P>
<P>
Before the arrests last month, sheriff's deputies, assisted by officers from 
Los Angeles, Pasadena, Monterey Park, El Monte, Arcadia and Baldwin Park, had 
been staking out the Black Dragon "crash pad" on a dead-end street in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
From there, police say they followed Thuan Kso Ngo, 29, Anthony Lenh, 19, Ty 
Pham, 22, and Vang Tran, 23, to the Beauty of Paris Salon in San Gabriel. Five 
hairstylists were in the shop, along with four customers, when the men 
allegedly barged in, two of them waving pistols. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old the owner of the salon remembers being ordered to lie face-down 
on the floor, as the men stripped the women of their jewelry and snatched more 
than $1,000 from the register. 
</P>
<P>
"We were scared," the owner said. "I kept thinking about God, that God would 
help us." 
</P>
<P>
Officers waiting outside arrested the four men as soon as they exited. At the 
dumpy, one-story bungalow in Rosemead where police said members of the gang had 
been living for the summer, officers arrested 14 others, including Hong Ly, 21, 
suspected in the Chinatown robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 who were later released, five were women. Four of those arrested were 
juveniles. All were photographed and fingerprinted. 
</P>
<P>
A public defender for one of the suspected gang members did not respond to a 
request for comment. It could not be determined whether the others had 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at the alleged crash pad last week, a middle-aged man cleaned 
up a pile of beer cans from the Alanreed Avenue property. 
</P>
<P>
"This was just a place where young people could come hang out," said the man, 
who identified himself as the building's owner. "It was all summer-vacation 
fun."

CUTS MAY CRIPPLE SOME SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley agencies could lose up to $13 million in mental health care 
and children's services money under state budget cuts imposed last week by Gov. 
George Deukmejian, social service providers say. 
</P>
<P>
Among the programs cut by Deukmejian is a YWCA-run child abuse prevention 
program that has counseled 14,000 schoolchildren annually in South Pasadena, 
Pasadena and San Marino for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Covina office of the County Department of Children's Services and the 
county-run Arcadia Mental Health Clinic, whose services were significantly 
reduced last year, also face cuts when the County Board of Supervisors meets 
this week to pass along the state cuts in the county's budget. 
</P>
<P>
At least five nonprofit mental health care agencies also face county pass-along 
cuts, including three of the largest: Foothill Community Mental Health in 
Glendora, La Puente Valley Mental Health Center in La Puente and Pacific 
Clinics, which operates in four San Gabriel Valley cities. 
</P>
<P>
The budget reductions mean that abused children, isolated and depressed seniors 
and the homeless mentally ill will have nowhere to turn for help, said Susan 
Mandel, president of Pacific Clinics. "Some of those folks are just going to 
plain die," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to be left in this stripped down system is people in hospitals or 
crisis management centers," said Ted Meyers, director of Foothill Community 
Mental Health. "Unless (the supervisors) make a change in direction, they're 
going to cut outpatient mental health care. I'll be surprised if we'll be here 
in two months." 
</P>
<P>
Agencies throughout the state are reeling under cuts in four separate 
categories that Deukmejian blue-penciled into a $55.7-billion state budget 
signed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles County, those cuts amount to $10.1 million in child abuse 
prevention funds from the state Child Abuse Prevention Training Act, $21.3 
million in mental health funds, $12 million in juvenile justice program money 
and $11 million in child welfare services. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, those cuts make up the bulk of money provided for 
children's mental health services contracted out to various nonprofit agencies, 
said Deborah Hamilton, San Gabriel Valley regional director of the Mental 
Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more children out in the bedroom communities than in downtown Los 
Angeles," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Dowling, assistant chief of the county Department of Mental Health, 
said cuts are expected this week in the budgets of virtually all agencies, with 
reductions in funding ranging from 10% to 100%. 
</P>
<P>
For Casitas Pacificas, an El Monte residential care center for 36 mentally ill 
patients, the cuts could mean the closing of the 9-year-old home and of a 
Baldwin Park vocational training school attended by many of its patients, said 
Richard Guajardo, executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo said he is trying to find agencies or homes to refer his clients to in 
anticipation of the budget cuts, but many of the alternatives also face cuts. 
"There just doesn't seem to be any place to refer them," he said. "I don't know 
what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Mandel said many agencies are hoping for a legislative override of the 
governor's actions. Otherwise, she said, many of the patients being seen by the 
various agencies will turn to the streets. "There's no place for these people 
to go," she said. "It's not like they can go down the street to a private 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the patients are indigent, with long histories of stays in state mental 
hospitals, Mandel said. They are severely mentally ill with schizophrenia or 
manic-depressive disorders and need supervision and drugs to maintain 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the kind of folks that if they don't get their medication, they hear 
voices telling them they are worthless and to kill themselves," Mandel said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the governor's actions appear to be withdrawing the state from 
mental health care, a state government responsibility since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the agencies are nonprofit with other funding, Meyers said 
that nonprofits cannot operate without a base of government funding. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas some San Gabriel agencies are waiting to see how much they will be cut 
by the county supervisors, operators of the child abuse prevention program run 
by the YWCA Pasadena Foothill Valley branch already know they won't be getting 
any money. 
</P>
<P>
The program was funded directly by the state, said community outreach 
coordinator Norma Navarro. Children from 4 to 18 were counseled to prevent 
physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as neglect and abduction. 
</P>
<P>
The program was probably cut because no statistics exist to prove its 
effectiveness, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some intervention programs were funded, but that occurs after the fact, after 
the child has been abused," Navarro said. "Prevention is the key."TARGETS OF

TOWN EMBRACES OUTDOOR ART TO SOFTEN ITS INDUSTRIAL IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SCULPTURES: CLAREMONT ARTIST'S "UNDONE ABSTRACTION" SITS IN SANTA FE SPRINGS 
PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Santa Fe Springs had more hazardous waste sites than public 
artworks. There wasn't a piece of art to be seen in the industrial city -- 
unless you appreciate the stark outlines of oil derricks and massive storage 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are two sculptures -- and counting. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, city officials dedicated "Undone Abstraction" by Claremont artist 
James Mitchell in a half-acre park on Pioneer Boulevard near Alburtis Avenue. 
The six-foot high, steel-slab sculpture painted red and black is the latest 
product of a year-old ordinance. It requires builders to donate an amount equal 
to 1% of their project cost toward public art for developments of at least $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The city's first piece of public artwork, Dennis Smith's sculpture of a little 
girl reading, was dedicated about a month ago in front of the city library in 
the town center. 
</P>
<P>
The public-art ordinance symbolizes an ambitious exercise in image-changing for 
this town with only 15,000 residents, but more than 3,000 businesses, including 
two oil refineries and a pair of hazardous waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the city opened Heritage Park, a $4 million project. The 6.5-acre 
park contains the ruins of a 19th Century estate and its restored Victorian 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past year, the city has also opened to the public the Clarke estate, 
a long-forgotten 8,000-square-foot, pre-1920 mansion that the city bought and 
restored for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion's original owners departed in the 1920s about the same time as the 
city's ranching image, when geologists discovered what was then the sixth 
largest known reserve of oil in the world, said Margaret Hammon, the city's 
cultural-resource specialist. 
</P>
<P>
But as the crude reserves dwindled, the nine-square-mile city, incorporated in 
1957, has found itself with plenty of Los Angeles county real estate to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The welcome mat is out," City Manager Don Powell said of the city's well-known 
pro-business stance, which has generated $60 million of development annually 
for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no artist behind it, the landscape of heavy industry owns a 
beauty of its own, said Hammon. On Carmenita Road below Imperial Highway, there 
remains a refinery on the east and dozens of huge storage tanks on the west 
side of the street. "At night, you should drive down that street," she said. 
"It's just beautiful. It's an interesting, glorious sight to see all those 
tanks lit." 
</P>
<P>
Hammon said the city's landscaped median strips and railway overpasses have 
long been a source of local pride. But Powell, the city manager, decided those 
enhancements weren't enough and circulated the public-art ordinance idea, which 
he said is modeled after similar regulations in Brea, Norwalk and Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
The program in Brea, another former oil town, has resulted in the creation of 
91 artworks since 1975. The rate now is about six a year. 
</P>
<P>
The works in Santa Fe Springs must reflect one or more of three historic 
periods: Mexican/Indian, turn-of-the-century ranching or industrial modern. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved its own version of the ordinance in 
November, 1988, but a concern over possible lawsuits from developers has 
delayed its start, said Jane Kolb, a spokeswoman for the city's Cultural 
Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
No such legal challenge was forthcoming from Jeffery Potter, the 36-year-old 
president of Potter Development Corp. Potter paid for the latest sculpture so 
he could build his just-completed, office-warehouse structure. 
</P>
<P>
Potter collects modern California art for his home and office. 
</P>
<P>
He could have placed the sculpture in front of his building, but agreed to the 
more accessible Pioneer Boulevard site, which is flanked by businesses on one 
side and a neighborhood of modest, boxy houses on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, who said he long wanted to be an artist, contributed about 
$10,000 more to the artwork's creation than the $14,000 required by the city.

SHERIFF'S AIR SQUADRON SEEKS LA VERNE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department would like to move its squadron of 
16 helicopters and two airplanes from Long Beach Airport to Brackett Field in 
La Verne because of a nearly tenfold rent increase at the Long Beach facility. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's Airport Bureau of Public Works raised the rent last October for 
the sheriff's Aero Bureau from $1,510 a month to $14,150 a month, said Lonnie 
Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Long Beach's Airport Bureau of Public Works. The 
rent increase came at the completion of a 20-year lease and one-year lease 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
The rent jumped dramatically because the property was rezoned in 1982 to permit 
commercial uses -- instead of exclusively airport-related operations -- and 
because of a vast increase in property values, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Cmdr. Lee Baca said the Aero Bureau hopes to move to Brackett Field 
-- sandwiched between Puddingstone Reservoir in San Dimas and the Los Angeles 
County Fairgrounds in Pomona -- if a reasonable rent and other lease terms can 
be negotiated with the San Gabriel Valley airfield. 
</P>
<P>
Before any agreement is reached, however, the Sheriff's Department has been 
ordered by the County Board of Supervisors to hold public hearings in La Verne, 
Pomona and San Dimas so that residents in those communities can hear about and 
discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's aircraft "will have a significant noise impact on the residents" 
in those communities, according to a resolution by Supervisor Pete Schabarum 
that requested the public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne Mayor Jon Blickenstaff agreed. "I think there are some possible 
benefits as far as having better access to services from the sheriff's 
helicopters. But I'm also concerned about noise and safety," Blickenstaff said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings have not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's Aero Bureau supports deputies on the ground in chasing suspects, 
and it transports prisoners and performs surveillance duties. The 53-employee 
bureau also assists in searches and rescues in remote areas.

PEOPLE: YEAR AFTER FIGHT FOR TENURE, UCLA PROF GETS CENTER POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON ITO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scarcely a year after an anti-discrimination battle with UCLA turned associate 
professor Don Nakanishi into a sort of folk hero among Asian-American 
activists, the university has appointed him director of its Asian American 
Studies Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it sort of indicates how different things can be in a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese-American born and raised in East Los Angeles, Nakanishi was granted 
a lifetime position at the Graduate School of Education in May, 1989, after a 
much-publicized, three-year fight over his initial denial of tenure. He and his 
supporters alleged that the denial was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi, who will divide time between his new post at the center and teaching 
and research at the graduate school, said he is finally getting back into a 
normal routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably had one of the most productive years I've ever had," said 
Nakanishi, who is continuing his pioneering research on Asian-American voting 
patterns and university admissions. "I must have written about seven articles, 
and I gave a lot of speeches. I got invitations to speak from all over the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
His battle for tenure, which was joined by hundreds of Asian-Americans who 
lobbied, raised money and picketed in his behalf, may have also worked in his 
favor when he interviewed for the directorship of the prestigious center, he 
added.

Sugar Price Supports 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 150 to 271, the House rejected an amendment to lower from 18 cents 
to 16 cents per pound the level at which the government props up the price of 
domestic sugar. Although theprogram sets an artificially high price that works 
its way through to consumers, it operates at small cost to the Treasury. The 
vote occurred as the House debated a five-year extension of federal farm 
programs (HR 3950). 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Jim Moody (R-Wis.) said: "To vote against this amendment is to say, 
'Down with the consumers, up with the handful of producers that benefit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jerry Huckaby (D-La.) said "the sugar program is a consumer program 
(providing) stable supplies of sugar at a solid, reasonable, predictable 
price." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to lower federal price supports and thus the market price of 
sugar.

Farm Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 159 to 263, the House rejected a farm bill amendment to deny 
federal crop support payments to the nation's wealthiest farmers, those with 
adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or more. The amendment would have reduced 
spending for loans, direct payments and other subsidies by $700 million 
annually. Some 20,000 individuals and 4,500 farm entities would have been 
denied payments under the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill Green (R-N.Y.) asked: "Is it such a harsh thing to ask that 
people who are above $100,000 a year in income come off the dole?" 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Neal Smith (D-Iowa) said the purpose of farm payments is not income 
maintenance but to stabilize supplies and prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to end taxpayer subsidies of the nation's wealthiest farmers.

Honey Program 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 178 for and 215 against, the House rejected an amendment to phase 
out the federal honey program over four years. This put the House treatment of 
honey in the new farm bill at odds with that of the Senate, which voted (below) 
to end the 51-year-old loan program that guarantees profits to about 2,000 
beekeepers regardless of market conditions. The program cost $385 million 
during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) called honey supports "the most ridiculous 
giveaway program to ever wriggle its way into the law books." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Glenn English (D-Okla.) said the honey program "has provided great 
benefit to not only American agriculture but the American consumer." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to phase out the federal subsidy of beekeepers.

<TEXT>
<P>
An air fare is advertised for $298. But when you pay for your ticket, you 
notice you've been charged $305. Another air fare is marketed at $500. But upon 
departure, you're informed that another $12 is needed. Isolated incidents? 
Incorrect fare calculations? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Airline fare surcharges represent one of the more insulting, insidious 
and often misleading aspects of travel. 
</P>
<P>
These extra charges are now being placed on a variety of domestic and 
international flights. They are not always disclosed to passengers by the 
airlines or their travel agents, they often appear and disappear without 
notice, and they can add substantially to the cost of travel. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these current charges that are included as part of your airline fare: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8% federal excise tax. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $6 international departure fee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $5 surcharge by certain U.S. airlines (Pan Am, American, TWA, United, Delta 
and Northwest) on their transatlantic routes to cover security costs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2.50 fuel surcharge on most domestic flights originating in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $5 fuel surcharge for flights from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2 fuel surcharge for flights departing from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2.20 fuel add-on for flights leaving San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $1 to $2 surcharge on most domestic flights leaving Denver to finance 
airport terminal improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $2 one-way security surcharge for flights heading towards the Bahamas or 
Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign passengers coming into the United States from countries 
other than Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean are assessed a $5 U.S. Customs fee. 
</P>
<P>
Most passengers never know about these surcharges before they make their ticket 
purchases. And many travelers only discover the excess fees after they've 
completed their journey. 
</P>
<P>
Both passengers and travel agents aren't thrilled about the additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
"It sometimes puts us in a bad position," says Annette Alvarez, director of 
sales and marketing for the Travel Store, a Los Angeles travel agency, "because 
we have to explain extra charges that we had nothing to do with. 
</P>
<P>
"These surcharges may not be that big, but they do have an effect on the 
leisure traveler, who feels that he or she is being abused. If they're going to 
add these charges, why not throw in a free headset or drink as compensation?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because it is not a prudent business decision to do so," says one airline 
spokesman. "We are adding the surcharges because they are costs assessed 
against us that we didn't plan on when we established our fare structures. We 
need to find a way to recover these costs." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the surcharges keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
At this writing, there are a number of newly proposed surcharges that only 
promise to make air travel even more expensive: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $1 to $3 U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection charge for passengers 
coming into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $1 charge (called a "ticket-writing fee") to fund the U.S. Travel and 
Tourism Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $1, $2 or $3 Passenger Facilities Charge, to fund expansion and 
renovation at U.S. airports. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An increase in the current federal excise tax on domestic tickets, from 8% 
to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed excise tax increase has drawn the most fire. 
</P>
<P>
"That represents a 25% tax increase," says Drew Steketee, executive director of 
the Partnership for Improved Air Travel, "and we think that's excessive and 
unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the partnership (funded by 14 airlines and 19 manufacturers) has 
been fighting the management of the Aviation Trust Fund (where the excise tax 
dollars rest), claiming that the fund has a substantial surplus and is not used 
fully to improve the U.S. air travel system. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law that established the fund, the 8% tax currently included as part 
of your domestic air fare pays for 100% of new air-traffic control systems, a 
substantial portion of airport capacity improvements, and a partial funding of 
the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, passengers pay a federal excise tax of 8% on all domestic airline 
tickets. That tax generates $4 billion in revenues. (Since 1982, more than $31 
billion has been raised for the Aviation Trust Fund. Currently, the fund has a 
balance of $14 billion, of which only half has been earmarked for aviation 
project spending.) 
</P>
<P>
That leaves a surplus of $7 billion. "With that kind of surplus," Steketee 
argues, "you've got to ask what do they want the additional money for? 
Historically, this fund has a track record that stinks, and most consumers have 
difficulty understanding the need for more funds when current funds aren't 
being committed." 
</P>
<P>
In June, the partnership generated 10,000 letters from its membership to 
Congress opposing the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending before Congress is a bill that would create a Passenger Facility 
Charge, or PFC. It would allow a charge of $1, $2 or $3 -- depending on the 
size and operating costs of an airport -- to passengers for using that 
particular airport. The charge would be collected as part of the airline ticket 
price. 
</P>
<P>
But the PFC legislation, if passed, might cost passengers far more than $3. For 
example, a passenger flying round trip between Los Angeles and New York who 
changes planes at a hub airport en route in each direction could pay a PFC as 
high as $12. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation has passed the House and is being considered in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some airlines have announced their own surcharges as a means of 
opposing local plans that would drive up their costs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after Las Vegas officials announced the expansion of an airport 
terminal, American Airlines argued -- unsuccessfully -- that the plans were too 
costly and that they would substantially increase the rent for terminal space 
that American paid in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
When McCarran Airport officials seemed to ignore American's protests, the 
airline announced that it was imposing a $7.50 per-passenger surcharge on Las 
Vegas flights to help cover the airline's higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon thereafter," reports one airline source, "the authorities reached an 
agreement with the airline, and the surcharge was dropped." 
</P>
<P>
American has since announced other surcharges, which were also dropped when no 
other competing carriers went along with the increases. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the Port Authority of New York (which operates both J.F.K. 
and La Guardia airports) informed a number of airlines using La Guardia that it 
would be installing imported granite floors in many of the terminal areas, 
which would result in higher user costs to the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, American and United protested vigorously. "It was not only an 
excessive charge," says American spokesman Al Becker, "it was unrealistic. Who 
needs imported granite? It's not as durable as the high-strength tile we were 
already using in other areas of the terminal. But they were requiring us to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
American says it was also being hit with similarly excessive charges at four 
other airports. "We saw no other way to recover our costs," says Becker, "than 
to announce a surcharge." 
</P>
<P>
In early July, American announced a $1 to $4 "excess facilities" surcharge on 
departures and arrivals that were due to take effect last week at La Guardia, 
Newark, New Orleans, West Palm Beach and Ft. Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
But when no other airline moved to match the surcharges, American quickly 
dropped them. 
</P>
<P>
The next time you make an airline reservation, double-check that the price 
quoted in advertisements is the actual price you will pay. If it is not, demand 
to know if there is a surcharge being added and, if so, the reason for the 
surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
If enough passengers complain -- to the airlines, to their travel agents and to 
their legislators -- there's a reasonably good chance that these annoying, and 
expensive, add-ons can be curtailed . . . or at least controlled.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: PISA MAYOR BEMOANS LEAN TOURIST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times news services and staff reports. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven months after the Leaning Tower of Pisa was closed to the public, work to 
keep it from toppling has yet to begin and the mayor of the tourist-abandoned 
city is appealing to Rome for help. 
</P>
<P>
The tower's 293 steps were last climbed on Jan. 7, when the former mayor 
reluctantly locked the wooden doors to the 180-foot tower with a steel key and 
expressed hope that work would begin soon so the monument could reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the mayor's office has a new occupant and the city has been losing 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in entrance fees -- the monument attracts some 
800,000 tourists a year who pay $3.35 U.S. apiece to climb the spiral staircase 
for an odd view of the Tuscan city. 
</P>
<P>
Some tourists still pass through Pisa, but with the tower closed, the city is 
less appealing, and newly elected Mayor Sergio Cortopassi said he would ask 
Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti for help. 
</P>
<P>
Cortopassi's predecessor signed an order last December authorizing closure, but 
experts have yet to get moving on a plan to stop the 800-year-old tower from 
leaning further. Experts estimate the work will cost $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Snakes alive: Train travel in China has always been an adventurous proposition, 
but it has become even more creepy of late. 
</P>
<P>
"For nearly one month, railway departments have seen various species of frogs 
and snakes filling train aisles, crawling on luggage racks and even in 
restrooms," according to a report in China's Legal Daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The cause is the illegal capture and sale of frogs and snakes by Chinese 
peasants with an eye for profit. Frog and snake meat are considered delicacies 
in China, but demand has outstripped supply, resulting in "wanton killing and 
trafficking" by industrious hunters, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
More than three tons of wild frogs and toads and 1 1/2 tons of snakes were 
confiscated by Shanghai authorities in May alone, the newspaper said, adding 
that in one instance, 30 bags of live snakes weighing 1,650 pounds were 
discovered being illegally smuggled on a freight car. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, van gone: A total of almost 1.3 million art lovers visited the 
"Vincent Van Gogh Retrospective" during its four-month exhibition at 
Amsterdam's Vincent Van Gogh Museum and the Kroller Muller Museum in Otterlo. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented collection of masterpieces from museums and private 
collections around the world closed last Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the 
Dutch artist's death. 
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam museum, which normally attracts 700,000 visitors a year, 
attracted 860,000 people since the exhibition opened March 31, while 431,000 
visited the Otterlo museum, 62 miles from Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
The museums used a reservations system to cut down on the anticipated crush in 
queues, limiting visitors to 700 an hour in Amsterdam and 500 in Otterlo. The 
system was observed with interest by officials from the Louvre in Paris, the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and London's National Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Big Easy riders: United Cabs in New Orleans has been encouraging riders to take 
longer rides in cabs by allowing them to use their Visa and MasterCards for 
fares on local trips, city and plantation tours and, especially, airport trips. 
There's a $5 minimum on all credit card charges. 
</P>
<P>
Border opening: Finland and the Soviet Union may open their border to allow 
Germans to visit the graves of thousands of compatriots who fell in World War 
II, the Helsinki newspaper Uusi Suomi reported. 
</P>
<P>
In return, a German war graves society is ready to pay $1.85 million U.S. to 
help finance the road and rail connections that the two countries plan to open 
to boost tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Germans fought alongside Finns against the Soviet Union during the 
Finnish-Soviet War of 1941-44, and many were buried in land later ceded to the 
Soviet Union. There are thought to be as many as 5,000 German war graves north 
of the 800-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
Flea-ing Venice: Visitors to Venice this summer have been plagued by an 
infestation of water fleas. The insect's bite produces a rash similar to a 
sunburn, followed by dozens of painful blisters. Doctors have been inundated 
with patients suffering these symptoms, and Italian health authorities blame a 
type of water flea that lives in the algae on the city's lagoons and thrives in 
hot weather. 
</P>

Photo, Since Pisa's Leaning Tower was closed in January, tourism has fallen off 
and the city has been hurt by the loss in revenue.

WHERE MAHARAJAHS ONCE HUNTED, INDIANS NOW STRIVE TO SAVE THE TIGERS

RANTHAMBHOR NATIONAL PARK, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early light of dawn, near the old banyan tree, there is cause for 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 paces from the old palace converted into a lodge, is the deep 
impression of a tiger's body, molded into the soft dust that carpets the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
The cook's young helper is the first to bring the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Mummy, tiger last night. Come," he says, tugging on Elizabeth Forster's arm as 
he urges her outside. 
</P>
<P>
Near the centuries-old tree, whose long branches brush the ground, Forster not 
only sees the tiger's outline, but the large paw marks imprinted along the dirt 
road. 
</P>
<P>
This, indeed, is a good omen. Surely we will spot a tiger this morning. 
</P>
<P>
There are five of us gathered outside the small lodge inside Ranthambhor 
National Park, once the hunting grounds for the maharajahs of Jaipur. Today it 
is a densely covered area of rolling hills in northwest India where some 45 
tigers roam across 135 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
We waited for our Jeep to take us down the dusty roads that crisscross the park 
like spider webs. Forster was particularly keen to see a tiger. Since the early 
1970s, the 80-year-old Englishwoman has visited the park almost every year, 
rarely missing the opportunity to spot one of the majestic big cats. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffi, our driver, pulled up and we piled into the vintage olive-green Jeep. 
In the crisp morning air, we drove deeper into the park where sambar, a large 
Asiatic deer that resembles elk, placidly munched on grass near one of the 
lakes. Several chital, an Asiatic spotted deer, drew together, giving us a 
timid stare from the thick, tall grass. 
</P>
<P>
We were cautioned not to step out of the Jeep for safety's sake although there 
has been no incident of tigers attacking vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, tiger tracks were visible along the road, which we followed 
farther and farther into the park. Our eyes were turned toward the bushes in 
hope of spotting a distinct striped form. 
</P>
<P>
As we rounded a corner, we saw standing in the middle of the road a dark man 
with a long, navy-blue coat and a red stocking cap. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Mr. Tiger," Forster called out. "Are we going to see a tiger this 
morning?" 
</P>
<P>
The man, slowly walking down the road, was one of the park's two official tiger 
spotters. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps," he said, pointing to more tracks. Then he growled like a tiger and 
screamed like a wounded chital. Forster laughed, and "Mr. Tiger" jumped into 
the back of the open-air Jeep to help with our search. 
</P>
<P>
We followed the road, dipping down into cool valleys, passing ancient Hindu 
temples and inching around grass-covered knolls. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a langur perched in a tree screeched a warning signal. Other monkeys 
on the ground banded together, searching for the invisible threat. We waited. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes ticked by, seeming like hours. Still nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The sun was rising higher, pushing the sweet, cool dawn towards morning. 
Someone likened the tiger search to a game of hide-and-seek. We were warm, but 
we weren't hot. It was time to return to the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Ranthambhor National Park is eight miles from the town of Sawai Madhopur in the 
desert state of Rajasthan, about a six-hour drive southwest of New Delhi. It is 
one of several reserves established in 1973 when the Indian government became 
concerned about the dwindling tiger population. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to save the tiger began none too soon. In 1900 there were about 
40,000 tigers in India. By 1972, that number had shrunk to 2,000, many 
scattered groups too small to maintain themselves, let alone multiply. Much of 
their habitat was being taken away by farmers, industrialists and timber 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the Indian government made a last-minute decision to outlaw tiger 
hunting and help save the nearly extinct animals. With the help and money of 
the World Wildlife Fund, Nepal and India agreed to set aside biological 
preserves intended to conserve the secretive and elusive creature, as well as 
save wild ecosystems. The premise was that nature would repair itself if left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
WWF money was used to buy wireless sets, vehicles and weapons to fight 
poachers. 
</P>
<P>
India started with nine preserves, Ranthambhor being one of them. Today there 
are 17, with India's tiger population having grown to about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
When India gained its independence from Great Britain in 1947, Ranthambhor 
passed from the hands of the Maharajah of Jaipur to the Rajasthan Forest 
Department. But the maharajah maintained the right to hunt on the property 
until 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Ranthambhor only had 14 tigers when it was made a preserve in 
1973. Fateh Singh Rathore, the first field director, said that in those days, 
you could go for months without glimpsing a tiger. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the current field director, Jawant Singh Nathawat, says there are about 
45 tigers and the preserve is nearing capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we are now facing is tourism," he said. "The tourists have reached 
the maximum capacity, not the tigers." 
</P>
<P>
Nathawat said that last year, 14,000 tourists visited the preserve, which was 
declared a national park in 1983. Some 10,000 of those visitors were Indians. 
The rest were foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The park was relatively obscure until a few years ago when Rajiv Gandhi, 
India's former prime minister, visited the area and helped thrust it into the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials now cope with the increased tourist traffic by limiting to nine 
the number of Jeeps that can wander along five designated routes, from 7 a.m. 
to 10 a.m. or 3 p.m. to sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations are limited, too. The park, surrounded in sections by huge 
medieval walls, has only one small lodge on its premises -- the Jogi Mahal 
Forest Resthouse. Four other hotels are in and around Sawai Madhopur. 
</P>
<P>
Once a small palace, the two-story Jogi Mahal houses six large rooms whose 
French doors open onto a veranda overlooking a large lake. While afternoon tea 
is being served, you can watch the crocodiles slither into the water and see 
rose-ringed parrots swoop overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no electricity, dusk is announced with the lighting of kerosene 
lanterns, whose flames dot the stucco-walled rooms like fireflies. You can 
spend the evening on the veranda -- swatting mosquitoes, waiting for sambar and 
chital to approach the lake and listening to frogs croak a cacophonous 
symphony. Later, dinner is served downstairs in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Looming over all this, high on a nearby hillside, is Ranthambhor Fort, an 
enormous medieval city surrounded by massive walls, towers and bastions. Inside 
are the remains of palaces, army barracks, Hindu and Jain temples, and an 
arsenal of old cannons. 
</P>
<P>
This city, which dates from the 9th Century, was at its peak of glory during 
the reign of the powerful Chauhan ruler, Hamir, who ascended to the throne of 
Ranthambhor in 1282. It was conquered by Ala-ud-din Kahlji in 1301 after a 
year's siege. After its capture, the fortified city was sacked by the Muslim 
victors, who destroyed most of its buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The walled city is not only fascinating for its untouched ruins, but for its 
bird's-eye view of the park. Two members of our party, avid bird-watchers, 
climbed atop the city's walls with binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned for lunch, they were alive with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see any interesting birds?" we asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but we saw an interesting four-legged animal with stripes," said Han, a 
Belgian schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you saw a tiger," Forster said, clapping her hands. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of looking for birds, Han and his friend, Chris, had aimed their 
binoculars toward the wildlife preserve. After waiting patiently, they finally 
saw a tiger strolling across a grassy field near the park's entrance. The 
animal then disappeared into the brush. 
</P>
<P>
We hoped the tiger was still around that afternoon when Sheffi returned. We set 
off down the road in a different direction, passing herds of sambar and chital. 
Near the lake, two male sambars locked horns and nudged each other back and 
forth, initiating a dance that signals the beginning of rutting season. 
</P>
<P>
We paused to watch a troop of partridge waddle down the road. The sharp cry of 
a peacock pierced the warm air. 
</P>
<P>
Around the bend, a flock of geese landed and took off from a lake with the 
grace of ballet dancers. But there was still no sign of a tiger. 
</P>
<P>
We saw a group of Jeeps hovering around a field blanketed with high, brown 
grass. We zoomed toward them, waited a while, but saw nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Then we rumbled through a narrow chasm, twisting left and right before we saw 
the tail end of a Jeep scurrying down the road. Ahead of the Jeep was another 
Jeep, rolling slowly to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
A sleek, muscular tiger was sauntering down the middle of the road. It 
meandered off the thoroughfare and into a field where it plopped down, yawned, 
and ever so nonchalantly began to groom itself, licking every inch of its front 
legs while cameras clicked furiously and smiles blossomed on faces all around. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, the tiger stretched and rolled on its back, then returned 
to its feet and wandered into the hills, oblivious to the excitement it had 
caused. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where Tigers Roam Free 
</P>
<P>
How to get there: Lufthansa (800-645-3880), United (800-241-6522) and Pan Am 
(800-221-1111) offer weekly or twice-weekly flights from Los Angeles to New 
Delhi. Round-trip air fare is about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Ranthambhor National Park is 240 miles southwest of New Delhi. Trains run every 
day from New Delhi to Sawai Madhopur. The trip takes about seven hours and 
costs approximately $40. Jeeps meet passengers at the train station to take 
them to the park, which is eight miles outside town. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations: The Jogi Mahal Resthouse is the best place to stay because it's 
the only one inside the park. Although it has no electricity, kerosene lanterns 
provide ample light and a colonial ambience. The lodge, on a lake with 
crocodiles, has only six rooms and costs $25 a day, including three good meals. 
For reservations, write Field Director, Ranthambhor National Park, Sawai 
Madhopur, India. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging in Sawai Madhopur includes the Anurag Hotel (about $20 per night) and 
the Maharaja Lodge ($80). 
</P>
<P>
Tour groups: These tour groups offer side trips to Ranthambhor National Park as 
part of their India packages: Travcoa, P.O. Box 2630, Newport Beach 92658,

THE TIMES SHOPPER: REFINED RUM COOLS OFF TOURISTS IN PUERTO RICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to this island are usually welcomed with a cooling concoction made 
with the native brew: rum. 
</P>
<P>
Apt, since the island is the world's major rum-maker and the tour of the 
Bacardi Distillery, offering tastings and access to a discount shop for rum and 
bar accessories, is among Puerto Rico's most popular and entertaining 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows for sure just where or when the first rum was made. But the 
liquor's history on Puerto Rico goes back almost 500 years to the time of 
Christopher Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
On his second voyage to the West Indies, Columbus brought and planted sugar 
cane, which soon became the region's top crop. Ponce de Leon introduced sugar 
cane to Puerto Rico when he was appointed governor of the island in 1508. 
</P>
<P>
Whether sugar cane juice was first distilled into rum by conquistadors or by 
pirates is a matter of conjecture; some say it was the Spanish, others claim it 
was the English. 
</P>
<P>
Early rum was a distant ancestor of the smooth, light, more refined drink we 
enjoy today. To get an idea of rum's rough, fiery origins, one need only 
consider the brand names under which it was labeled: Kill-Devil, Whistle-Belly 
Vengeance, Rattle-Skull and Bounce and Sling. 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico took the lead in modern, quality rum-making by establishing 
production standards. The main force has been the Bacardi family, distillers 
who refined their product and marketing techniques to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
It began when Don Facundo Bacardi Maso, a wine expert, emigrated in 1830 from 
Barcelona to Santiago, Cuba, where he began making rum for his own amusement 
and consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Friends who sampled his smooth, mellow product urged him to produce it 
commercially. In 1862, he purchased a small distillery and began making Bacardi 
rum, known as "Bat Rum" because the distillery was inhabited by a colony of 
fruit bats. The bat is still Bacardi's logo. 
</P>
<P>
Bacardi got widespread name recognition because of two drinks associated with 
it: the Bacardi Daiquiri, created in 1896 by an American mining engineer and 
named after Cuba's copper mines where he worked, and Cuba Libre, first mixed in 
1900 by Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders, who blended a new soft drink, 
Coca-Cola, with their Bacardi. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936 the company, then headed by Bacardi's three sons, expanded to Puerto 
Rico, a strategic ploy designed to eliminate U.S. customs duties on liquor 
imported from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Bacardi became one of Puerto Rico's biggest employers and a 
powerful force in the island's development. A new distillery, opened in 1958 on 
127 acres of reclaimed swampland in the San Juan suburb of Captain, became 
Bacardi's headquarters when Fidel Castro took over the Cuban plant in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Local guide companies offer Bacardi Distillery tours for $25 per person, 
including motor-coach transportation from hotels or dockside to the plant and 
back. But there is really no need to book these. 
</P>
<P>
You can get to the Distillery on your own by taking the Catano Ferry (10 cents 
per person), then hailing a publico (shared taxi, $2 per person each way) that 
drops you off directly in front of the Bacardi plant. Just ask the guard at the 
gate for the tours, which are free. 
</P>
<P>
Tours begin at the Bacardi bar, a huge, bat-shaped patio with small round 
tables and comfortable chairs. The bar pours unlimited quantities of 
sample-size servings of several varieties of Bacardi rum, and a variety of 
cocktails prepared from them. 
</P>
<P>
There are basically three rums: white, gold or amber and anejo (aged). Bacardi 
currently makes seven rums. Silver Label is a smooth, light, dry spirit with 
subtle aroma and flavor for daiquiris, martinis and tonic drinks. Amber Label 
is a smooth dark, dry spirit with more pronounced aroma and flavor, ideal for 
mixing with lemon-lime soda or ginger ale, or for serving on the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Bacardi Premium Black, smooth and very flavorful, mixes well with fruit juices 
and coladas. Bacardi Anejo, a blend of aged aromatic spirits, is best sipped 
neat or on the rocks. Bacardi Gold Reserve, top of the line, is the master 
blend of aged spirits and is best served in a snifter, neat or on the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bacardi 1873, an extra dry blend, nor Bacardi 151 Proof, used for 
flavoring fancy drinks and cakes, are sold on the mainland, but they may be 
sampled and bought in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
At the Bacardi bar, which also serves soft drinks and juice, personal 
discretion determines how much rum any individual imbibes. Sometimes greedy 
guests don't make it through the tour, which is a pity because it's 
fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the bar, the tour sets out on a pleasant drive on an open bus around 
the pretty Bacardi gardens. First stop is the distillery building, where a 
guide leads the way through control rooms, around 20 huge vats filled with 
50,000 gallons of fragrant fermenting molasses, past four six-story distilling 
towers of gleaming steel, and around tanks used for blending and countless 
white oak barrels in which rum is being aged. 
</P>
<P>
The four-tower fractional distillation process is explained in English and 
other languages. In the first tower, the fermented liquid is heated to 220 
degrees to remove water from the alcohol. The temperature in the second tower 
is 200 degrees to remove the aldehydes from the alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The third tower is set at 187 degrees to remove unwanted oils from the alcohol. 
In the fourth and final tower, the temperature is 170 degrees for final 
purification. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also tour the gleaming bottling and labeling plants that turn out 
23,000 cases, or approximately 100,000 bottles, of rum per day. There is also a 
fine museum featuring an enormous trompe l'oeil mural about Bacardi's history, 
painted in 1966 by Palmer Hill and Ronald Millard, two Greenwich Village 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Last is the shop, stocked with rum, bar accessories and other souvenirs at 
terrific prices. For example, the five-item combination gift pack, with two 
Silver Labels, two Anejos and one 151 Proof (one-liter bottles), costs $28.15. 
A five-pack with three Silver Labels and two Gold Reserves is $33.25. 
</P>
<P>
A four-pack with one Silver Label, one Amber Label, one Premium Black and one 
Anejo (one-liter bottles), costs $22.60. There are two-packs: two Premium Black 
for $15.20, one Silver and one Premium Black for $12, one silver and one Amber 
for $8.50 or two Ambers for $8.50. A special Gold Reserve gift pack with two 
Bacardi logo snifters costs $11.25; Anejo with two snifters is $9.90. Bottles 
of 1873 (750 milligrams) sell for $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are Bacardi ice buckets ($15.30), beach sheets with the bat 
logo or confetti patterns ($8.15), T-shirts ($4.50), carry bags ($8.35), 
Bacardi dominos ($5.65) and other souvenir items. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Bacardi shop is not the only game in town. Bottles of rum can 
also be purchased at good prices at most supermarkets in Puerto Rico. For 
example, Selectos Capitol, a chain store in San Juan, sells Bacardi Silver 
Label for $4.19 per liter, Anejo for $7.69 per liter and Gold Reserve for $9.99 
per liter, just slightly higher than at the Bacardi store. 
</P>
<P>
This shop does not carry 1873 and 151 Proof, and was out of stock on Amber 
Label. But it did offer selections from several other Puerto Rican rum 
distilleries: Granado Dark for $4.25 per liter, Don Q for $5.00 per liter or 
$11.75 per half-gallon, and Ron del Barrilito's two-star (aged 8 years) for 
$6.95 per liter and three-star (aged 12 years) for $7.70 per liter. 
</P>
<P>
The airport duty-free shop offers Bacardi Silver and Amber Labels for $4.65 per 
liter, Anejo for $6.95 per liter, Gold Reserve for $9.75 per liter and Premium 
Black for $7.95 per liter. 
</P>
<P>
Buy as much as you want without worrying about customs; Puerto Rico is part of 
the United States.

SCOTCH-IRISH HOST A HIGHLAND FLING IN COLORADO

<TEXT>
<P>
If ye've e'en a wee drappie o' Celtic blood running thrae yere veins, ye'll 
feel it leap at the sound o' the distant piper warming to the mournful melody 
of "Amazing Grace." 
</P>
<P>
I spotted the lone musician through the early morning mist, bagpipe clutched to 
his chest. His bright red tartan stood out in striking contrast to the brooding 
mountains behind, their peaks cut off at half-mast by the fog. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second weekend in September and the high, rugged Colorado Rockies 
suggested Scotland's haunting Highlands, even down to the cool damp air and 
squishy wet grass. It made me wish for Wellies (British slang for waterproof 
Wellington boots) and mittens. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away were taut, white, square tents with brightly colored 
flags fluttering in the timid breeze. It could have been the prelude to a 
medieval joust, or a time-capsule view of makeshift solders' quarters on the 
eve of the Battle of Culloden. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was the annual Long's Peak Scottish-Irish Festival in Estes Park -- 
a small tourist-friendly town on the edge of Rocky Mountain National Park, 65 
miles northwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, to be held this year Sept. 8-9 at historic Stanley Park Field, 
attracts visitors from all over the country -- 15,000 in 1989, according to 
James A. Durward, an Estes Park dentist of impeccable Scottish lineage who's 
festival president. 
</P>
<P>
"We draw fans from coast to coast, including Hawaii and Canada," Durward said. 
</P>
<P>
And there are plenty of beguiling sights. Perhaps the most visible are the 
tartans and all things Scotch-Irish worn by participants and visitors alike. 
</P>
<P>
Pipers are arrayed in the particular tartan of their band, but you'll also see 
spectators in costume, many in full dress, including a kilt, a plaid (a 
blanket-like coat, rhymes with shade), a sporran (the pouch worn on a belt in 
front of the kilt), topped off with a busby (a tall military fur headdress). 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in denim for last year's early September festival, I decided the first 
order of business was to buy a bit of finery so that I, too, could be part of 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Tam or bonnet? Choosing a $40 tam that included the pewter boar-head insignia, 
I then found a wonderful kiltmaker under a bright blue and white striped tent. 
Yes, some of the tents house merchants -- not knights in shining armour -- 
offering a vast selection of tartan fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Once a fabric is chosen, you are measured and the measurements sent to 
Edinburgh, Scotland, where a kilt will be custom-made for you. Prices on an 
average are $250 for a gentleman's kilt, $150 for a lady's. Orders are promised 
within 60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Possessing more than a little of the Scot in my heritage, I selected a Campbell 
tartan, Black Watch pattern with a fine yellow stripe. (Although I was later 
informed that the bit of yellow was a modern day invention, I'm not sure I 
believe that.) 
</P>
<P>
If you have no trace of Scotch-Irish ancestry, you won't feel morally obligated 
to choose your clan's tartan. If the red and green of clan Stewart's( royal 
tartan appeals to you, go for it. Or how about Macpherson's gray, black and red 
hunting tartan? 
</P>
<P>
If you've succumbed to the enticement of the plaid, but only want a token, 
consider buying a tie woven in one of more than 100 patterns. Or a Harris Tweed 
jacket. Or a thick, off-white genuine Irish fisherman's sweater. 
</P>
<P>
A wide assortment of Celtic merchandise is offered for sale -- dulcimers, 
weapons of Scotland, paperweights, mugs and plates with clan crests, thimbles, 
jewelry, books and military prints, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
But the reason we've come is the music. 
</P>
<P>
The star of the show is the bagpipe. One of history's oldest musical 
instruments, it is found in Babylonian carvings from before 1000 BC, and 
mentioned in the Old Testament. Its eerie whine, produced by Scottish regiments 
as far back as the l6th Century, has been credited with frightening many an 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
On this grand day of festivity, the pipe bands will be in competition, not 
combat. The glory of the costumes, the precision of the marchers and the fervor 
of the crowd contribute to the pageantry, but it's the sounds -- the awesome, 
fearful bagpipe sounds -- that stir the soul. 
</P>
<P>
For maximum excitement, don't miss the Gathering of the Clans. At approximately 
noon on both days, more than a dozen world-class pipe bands assemble before the 
grandstand for a brief welcoming ceremony, after which the pipers, joined by a 
few non-pipe bands, march out in review. 
</P>
<P>
Later, to settle the spirit and soothe the soul, look for the tent of Scottish 
recording artist Alex Beaton, who will also be at this year's festival. He will 
bring a tear drap tae yere e'e if ye've that wee drappie o' Scots blood when he 
sings songs of ancient balladry (some a bit bawdy). 
</P>
<P>
The Celts are a hardy breed and would never have a festival without 
stick-to-the-rib fare. The all-Celtic menu choices traditionally include 
include Scotch broth, British bangers, Cornish pasties (meat pies), new 
potatoes with sour cream and dill, roasted corn, Scotch eggs (boiled eggs 
wrapped with sausage and deep-fried) and currant scones with jam. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the latter, a noble soul munching last year on the somewhat dried-out 
biscuit was heard to remark, "You've got to love things Scot, to love scones." 
</P>
<P>
After your meal, stroll the perimeter of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Colleens of all ages participate in Irish dancing competitions. Perhaps the 
grace of the performance grows out of its distinctive stylization: The Irish 
dancer moves from the hips down only. The remainder of the body is held rigid, 
with the arms kept at the sides. 
</P>
<P>
Moseying on you'll come upon braw (big) Scottish lads, dressed in kilts, 
engaging in events known as Highland Games. Probably the most famous is the 
caber toss, which dates from the l6th Century, when contests of stamina and 
strength were one way to choose soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Resembling an uprooted telephone pole, an average caber is 19 feet long and 
weighs 120 pounds. The tosser lifts the pole up, balances it in a vertical 
position and attempts to toss it end over end so that it lands straight ahead 
and exactly verticle to the thrower's body, for a perfect score. 
</P>
<P>
The Textile Arts tent presents demonstrations of the daily work Scottish and 
Irish women have performed through the ages. Here you can see fleece being spun 
into yarn, fleece and yarn being dyed and cloth being woven. 
</P>
<P>
In the final process, called "waulking the wool," a long bolt of contiguous 
cloth is kneaded, much the way bread dough is, by women sitting at a round 
table, to produce a thicker, denser fabric. 
</P>
<P>
A friendly spinner at last year's festival explained that in olden times an 
Irishman would be given a "waulked wool" and would not only expect to have it 
all his life, but to be buried in it as well. 
</P>
<P>
Dog fanciers will want to visit the exhibit featuring breeds recognized as 
having their origins in the British Isles. Last year, 61 breeds were 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
For amusement, catch the Herding Instinct Test. Although herding dogs were 
developed to help with farm livestock, most of them have never seen a sheep. To 
test their instincts, dogs are put into a pen with sheep to see how long it 
takes them to get the idea and start organizing the sheep. Comical moments 
almost always occur. 
</P>
<P>
If your surname is not a typical clan one, you may want to check with the 
clan-sponsored exhibit tents anyway. For example, did you know that Allan, 
Bartlett, Brice, Leaper, Miller, Robb and Smith are recognized septs, or 
branches, of clan MacFarlane? Ye may ha'e that wee drappie after all. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun's rays grew shorter and the shadows longer, a bit of melancholy 
crept over me. I had been mesmerized, transported back to another age. A simple 
age. A fierce age. A loyal age. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking off my wistfulness, I set off for one of the grandest sound-and-sight 
shows ever: the military Tattoo held every year at the Stanley Park Fairgrounds 
Arena in conjunction with the festival. It involves pipe and brass bands, fife 
and drum, cannon, drill teams and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Performed by torchlight, it envelopes you in rhythm and sound. (A hint: If the 
weather is chilly, take a blanket. Heaters hanging from above help, but are not 
enough.) 
</P>
<P>
Now if I yearn for a bit o' the Scots, I can always take out my tam and put it 
on. Or listen to my Alex Beaton tape. Or wait till next year.

L.A. VS. ORANGE COUNTY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as the rest of the country is concerned Orange County is nothing, nil, 
zero, zilch. 
</P>
<P>
Plain and simple it does not exist. This country revolves around two cities: 
New York and L.A. Sorry, but that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
If one can put up with a sea of provincial mental midgets, Orange County is a 
pleasant place to live.

"One in six . . . commute to earn an L.A. paycheck and enjoy it in Orange 
County" is a strong argument for an L.A. income tax -- on O.C. and other 
commuters. This is in fact a practice in some eastern cities. 
</P>
<P>
Capital is generated by L.A., drained into O.C. by commuter spending and tax 
flight, leaving L.A. with a permanent tax imbalance. Amenities not affordable 
by L.A. communities are enjoyed in O.C., paid by taxes whose source is L.A.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: PECKING ORDERS BIRDERS AND TWITCHERS: EQUALLY AVID AVIAN 
WATCHERS -- BUT WITH DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMERICANS AND the British are not only separated by a common language but they 
also seem not to understand one another's sports. Though Americans are 
beginning to watch soccer, it is not the sport of enormous popularity in 
America that it is in Britain, and cricket is quite incomprehensible to 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that the one sport that might bring us together is birding. I am 
awed by the dedication and vigor our British cousins bring to that gentle 
sport. Recently, thanks to a clipping from the Guardian sent to me by Jim and 
Suzan Moore, now residents of Cambridge, I told how a mob of 2,000 twitchers 
tramped through a Norfolk woods for a glimpse of a rare red-breasted nuthatch 
reported in that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A twitcher is a birder who is interested only in adding another bird to his 
life list and will go to any lengths, using any kind of conveyance, to 
accomplish those ends. Ordinary birders -- who seek mainly the fresh air, 
exercise and communion with nature that their sport affords -- do not 
especially like twitchers. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, however, Alice Everett McCloskey sent me a clipping from the 
Dickinson (N. D.) Press that reported on the National Audubon Society's 
Christmas bird count in and around Medora. Although the windchill factor was 30 
degrees below zero, 15 hardy Dakotans showed up for the count. The sky was 
overcast, and the sun did not shine as they fanned out from Theodore Roosevelt 
National Park Visitor's Center at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
One group consisted of two men and their sons, ages 10 and 6. As the Press put 
it, "the four-man crew was armed with binoculars, bird books and had their eyes 
peeled for fluttering wings." They soon sighted a rooster ringneck pheasant and 
heard a chickadee. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, that group sighted 10 species, including a golden eagle, 
sharp-tailed grouse, black-tailed magpies and robins. Evidently, though, the 
cold kept many birds in their hiding places, but the birders also saw species 
of wildlife other than birds, including deer, a herd of antelope, a porcupine, 
a coyote and many cottontails. Meanwhile, the sun remained hidden, and the 
birders were assaulted by continuous snow flurries. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, birders as hardy as those Dakotans could identify with British birders 
and twitchers. The weather in the British Isles is not that much better than it 
is in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Moores sent me another clipping from the Guardian, updating the 
birding scene in England. It notes that twitchers, the more aggressive of the 
two kinds of birders, spend much time telephoning Birdline, a British service 
that reports on rare sightings. No matter how distant the sighting may be, the 
true twitcher makes a beeline for the location by whatever transportation is at 
hand. Some twitchers have gone to extraordinary lengths to add one bird to 
their list. 
</P>
<P>
One birder who owns a private jet keeps it fueled up so he can speed on an 
instant's notice to a distant sighting. In 1988, four Cambrian lads drove 500 
miles in 14 hours, sighting 138 birds along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, such exertions sometimes come a cropper. Last year, a group of 
twitchers were hiding in a reed bed near Portsmouth, hoping to sight a rare 
red-breasted pochard. Alas, it took off and flew into a passing car, "reducing 
itself to a pathetic bunch of feathers." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchers sometimes get out of hand. Recently one was jailed for throwing rocks 
into a bush to disturb his quarry. But twitchers are said to be trying to 
discourage this kind of misconduct among their own. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchers are often frustrated. Those 2,000 who tramped through the Norfolk 
woods in search of the red-breasted nuthatch heard later that the bird had been 
seen miles away by a woman walking her dog. 
</P>
<P>
A boat full of twitchers was heading toward the Isles of Scilly when a storm 
blew up. The boat heaved about for 15 hours, unable to make harbor, and the 
seasick twitchers returned empty-handed to Penzance. 
</P>
<P>
The Guardian repeats the well-known story of an American bird that accidentally 
landed in the Scillies some years ago. As hundreds of twitchers trained their 
'scopes, snapped pictures and scribbled notes, a cat crept up and carried off 
their quarry. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Millington, a founder of Birdline, acknowledges his addiction to 
twitching. "I admit it's an obsession. I suppose I have missed out on many 
other things, but I can't imagine what life would be like without twitching." 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that Anglo-American relations would be improved if a number of 
British birders and twitchers were to come to North Dakota for the annual 
Christmas count. They could probably add some unusual birds to their lists, and 
at least they might see a porcupine. 
</P>
<P>
They'd best wear their ear muffs, though.

BASEBALL MAY BE THE NATIONAL PASTIME, BUT BASKETBALL MAKES HARRY HOOP IT UP

I AM VENTURING into a danger zone here. More than once I've derided the growing 
legion of writers who, with too much lyricism in their hearts, pour out 
seemingly unedited reams of overblown prose about the game of baseball. Knowing 
full well the peril of weighing down a simple game with the tedious baggage of 
Meaning, I write today in praise of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
This is not in the grand tradition. Basketball has no hallowed ritual on the 
order of the Hot Stove League, sitting around during the off-season reminiscing 
about seasons past. If you ask me, this is at least partly because -- unlike 
baseball -- it is actually more fun to watch or play basketball than to 
remember watching or playing it. 
</P>
<P>
But now is the perigee of the basketball year. The Lakers are all off in Hawaii 
or filming commercials, the Clippers are -- if they're smart -- loading up on 
health insurance, and nobody's playing the game, except for the millions of us 
doing it for sheer pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not going to wax poetic on the finer points of the pro game. After a decade 
of Magic Johnson's pedagogy, Los Angeles fans are up to speed. There was a time 
when aficionados from points East would sneer at the locals assembled in the 
Forum. Like the obloquy directed at Hollywood Bowl patrons who clap between 
movements, this sneering did have a certain factual basis, although it derived 
its emotional power from the fact that the Easterners couldn't deal with not 
being cold. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the pros play is indeed a fine way to waste one's time on the planet. 
And it is what I'm built for. But against all genetic inclination, I keep 
insisting on playing the game as well. And therein lie basketball's true 
charms. 
</P>
<P>
Not that I knew this in my youth. My childhood appreciation for any sport was 
stunted by as deranged a collection of Phys Ed teachers as anyone has endured 
this side of the Tontons Macoute. But a friend invited me to an L.A.-Phoenix 
game, which just happened to occur in the middle of the Lakers' still-unmatched 
33-game winning streak, and the next day he took me to a playground to begin my 
asphalt education. We've long since lost touch, but every time I leave the gym, 
sweat-soaked and happy, replaying the good moments and the hideous 
embarrassments, I pause to send him a mental thank-you note. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball is a straightforward game. A small court, a few guys or gals, one 
big ball, a hoop. It doesn't demand expensive equipment; it can be played 
virtually anywhere the ground is flat enough to build on. This democratic 
nature of the sport has more to do with the current domination of the pro game 
by African-Americans than do the genetic theories of Jimmy the Greek. But it 
also explains the spread of basketball far and wide, the recent injection of 
half a dozen talented Yugoslavs into the NBA being the most current example. 
Some of these players are good enough to prompt calls for breaking up 
Yugoslavia. Fortunately, the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes are already working on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Because basketball is so simple and widely understood, you can play it with 
anyone, anywhere. You can always walk into a strange gym, or onto an unfamiliar 
playground, begin playing with a group of people you've never met before, have 
a great time, and a couple of hours later bid them farewell, perhaps forever. 
No other part of life provides for such consistently satisfying transactions 
with total strangers. Well, maybe prostitution, but I wouldn't know. 
</P>
<P>
I've played on a court in Amsterdam, surrounded by the city's great museums, 
where kids from Germany yelled the names of NBA players they'd seen on 
highlight tapes as they imitated the stars' moves. "Lah-ree Bird!" a tall blond 
would yell as he sank a jumper from outside. This invocation of the names was 
the only English, or any language, spoken. 
</P>
<P>
I've even ventured out, once, onto one of New York's fabled street courts, 
where a teammate lectured me harshly for not helping him lie about the score so 
that, rather than face defeat and give way to the next team, we could keep 
playing. And I got to play against one of the most talented women players in 
the world on a court in Harlem. She left me more limp and useless than a 
tattered dishrag, but she sure was fun to watch as she glided by. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, though, it's not easy to play ball in New York, even if you've 
got the guts or the appetite for humiliation. When the weather turns brutish, 
you might as well be trying to find a good round of pickup cricket. Once, while 
I was visiting, a friend tipped me to a Monday evening indoor game on the upper 
West Side. So I packed my gym clothes, bundled up against the November cold, 
took a $10 cab ride uptown, found that I had to pay a lady at a card table $5 
more just to enter the sanctum gymtorum -- and then saw two dozen other guys 
waiting for a chance to play one game, on the one court, in the hour and a half 
before the place closed. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that I decided New York can have all the opera and ballet companies 
it likes. If you can't jump in your car and find a game within five minutes at 
any time of the year, you ain't got culture.

Long hair is still in style, and it's anything but boring -- innovative hair 
ornaments made of everything from silk to marble are becoming a must. Gone are 
high-maintenance, moussed hairdos -- replaced with clasped, knotted or pinned 
sculptural ponytails, braids and chignons. 
</P>
<P>
Astute jewelry and beauty-industry designers are creating ornaments rich in 
color and baroque in shape to match current fashion trends. Materials include 
fabric, wood, metals, wire, acrylics and gold leaf. Bejeweled or sculpted hair 
sticks secure a bun or French twist, while the common hair bow adopts the more 
sophisticated look of stainless steel mesh. And don't settle for a plain old 
rubber band to hold hair in place -- go for a wired silk rope or spiral of 
copper, which lends elegance to even a simple ponytail. LISA THACKABERRY

LOOKS: A MAN'S EYES; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN MACHO TYPES ARE ENHANCING LASHES, PLUCKING BROWS, CONCEALING BAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG FISHER, Craig Fisher is a frequent contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN ERNEST Hemingway first met Scott Fitzgerald in a Paris bar in 1925, he was 
struck by his rival's boyish good looks. Fitzgerald, he later wrote, had a 
delicate mouth and "excited and friendly eyes." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, throughout Fitzgerald's life, people remarked on his eyes. When he was 
a boy, they were described variously as green, blue or gray. And a Princeton 
friend remembered him as "the handsomest boy I've ever seen. He had yellow hair 
and lavender eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not all men are blessed with such mesmerizing features -- 
especially since many women say that a man's eyes are what they notice first. 
But eye-care specialists and grooming professionals say there are many things a 
man can do to enhance his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Makeup artist Mark Richard, whose clients have included Kirk Douglas and Robert 
Stack, thinks that if a man is being photographed for a wedding or a corporate 
brochure, he shouldn't hesitate to apply a little concealer to camouflage dark 
circles under his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But even a man who would never wear cosmetics, Richard says, should make sure 
that his eyes are well-groomed. "I'd start with what I call elephant-hair 
eyebrows," he says of the coarse hairs that sprout as a man gets older. 
"They're not only unflattering but aging." To get rid of them, he suggests, 
stroke each brow inward, toward the bridge of the nose, and then clip any stray 
hairs left standing. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, "it's true what your mother told you: Eyes that look too close 
together make a man look as if he can't be trusted." So a man whose brows run 
together may want to consider plucking them with tweezers, asking his 
haircutter to do it or having them waxed. 
</P>
<P>
Eyebrow waxing is available at numerous hair and skin-care salons. Catherine 
Wood is an independent facialist who works at the Cristophe salon in Beverly 
Hills and charges $12 to wax a man's brows. 
</P>
<P>
Wood also dyes eyelashes ($18) and uses a collagen pack to alleviate dryness 
around the eyes. "It's a sponge saturated with collagen liquid that I lay 
around the eyes at the end of a massage," she says. "It's $15 extra on top of a 
facial, which costs $60." While Wood acknowledges that "crow's-feet can look 
good on men," such lines can disturb some people's self-esteem. Hence, more and 
more cosmetics manufacturers are offering eye creams formulated to minimize 
wrinkles. Kiehl's Since 1851 is a venerable New York company whose products are 
available at selected retailers (Neiman Marcus and Fred Segal) and by mail. 
Among its products is Ultra Protection Moisturizing Eye Gel, with a sun 
protection factor of 18 (about $30). 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Heidegger, spokesman for men's division of Kiehl's, says that any man who 
engages in an outdoor sport should use at least a moisturizer, especially 
around the eyes, if he wants to forestall wrinkling. "Runners sweat," he says, 
"so they need to apply it more." Kiehl's also makes a water-resistant Mt. 
Everest '88 Expedition Sunscreen with an SPF of 18 (around $14), which 
Heidegger says is particularly good for skiing and sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities can also take their toll on a man's eyes. As he got older, the 
alcoholic Fitzgerald's eyes appeared bloodshot and bleary. But Dr. Peter 
McDonnell, an ophthalmologist at the Doheny Eye Institute at USC, says that "as 
part of the aging process, your eyes are a little less clear. You get little 
broken blood vessels in other parts of your body as well, but the conjunctiva 
(the mucous membrane that covers the front of the eyeball) being so thin, they 
show up in your eyes more."

McDonnell says that "some conjunctival changes -- raised spots, yellowish maybe 
-- are caused by ultraviolet-light exposure. So there seems to be a good 
rationale for wearing UV-absorbing sunglasses. And the effect seems to be 
cumulative, so the earlier you start using them, the better -- driving, skiing, 
on the beach, sailing." 
</P>
<P>
But if a man's eyes are merely betraying fatigue or overindulgence, McDonnell 
says, eye drops and other simple measures can help. "Some people find comfort 
with a cool washcloth," he says. "Coolness constricts blood vessels and can be 
soothing. It decreases swelling."

Meanwhile, Richard insists that more men than one would ever suspect are using 
makeup to give Mother Nature a hand. At many beauty supply stores, he says, a 
man can buy black hair pomade and use a smear of it to darken and add luster to 
his lashes.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: THE CO-DEPENDENT PARENT FREE YOURSELF BY FREEING YOUR CHILD 
BY BARBARA COTTMAN BECNEL (LOWELL HOUSE: $19.95) 
</P>

Used to be, you could get a lot of mileage out of having bad parents. Just 
think: If Eugene O'Neill's parents had known how to do the right thing, he 
might never have had cause to write "Long Day's Journey Into Night." 
</P>
<P>
Or what if Philip Roth's folks had cleaned up their act? Would he ever have 
written "Goodbye, Columbus"? Would Woody Allen have grown up to be Alan Alda? 
In the old, unenlightened days, people knew how to make the most of mom and 
dad's neuroticism. 
</P>
<P>
But in the addiction-fest of the last few years, it's become essential, if not 
absolutely trendy, to purge oneself of all problems. And if you don't think you 
have any problems, you probably know, and relate to, someone who does, which 
makes you a co-dependent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Co-Dependent Parent" starts off with a chilling, if statistically vague, 
suggestion: "Most of us are co-dependent parents to a greater or lesser 
degree," writes Becnel. Even the seemingly well-intentioned mom or dad fits 
into one of her five categories: parents who are too demanding, too critical, 
overprotective, disengaged or ineffective. She presents case studies to 
illustrate each problem, and then offers advice and verbal exercises designed 
to break the behavioral cycle. 
</P>
<P>
It's all well intentioned and earnest -- Becnel's strongest credential is her 
own experience as the daughter of a gambler father and long-suffering mother -- 
but it's hard to believe that her routinized solutions, which include such 
psychological golden oldies as "I'm OK, You're OK," would suffice if, as she 
asserts, co-dependency is a generations-old pattern people fall into before 
they realize what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
If a family is smart enough to seek help, "The Co-Dependent Parent" seems too 
elemental; if a family is drowning in mutual self-destruction, it seems too 
slight to offer salvation.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: CONSUMER REPORTS 1990 BUYING GUIDE ISSUE BY THE EDITORS OF 
CONSUMER REPORT (GREY CASTLE PRESS: $29.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the inadvertent byproducts of the Reagan presidency's gutting of the 
federal regulatory system was to make Consumers Union -- never a friend of the 
caveat emptor philosophy espoused by free-market advocates -- more powerful. As 
the federal government grew deliberately more lax in ensuring the safety of 
goods and services offered consumers, ordinary people needed some organization 
they could trust to tell them whether what they bought was safe to use, and 
whether it met its specifications or its users' needs. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union, through its magazine Consumer Reports, has been doing just 
that -- buying products at retail establishments, then testing them and 
reporting the results -- for 54 years. Now CR now has a paid circulation in 
excess of 4.4 million, making it one of the most important merchandising tools 
in the United States (even though its tests cannot be used by a company in its 
advertising or promotion). 
</P>
<P>
A good review in CR means store shelves will be wiped clean of the product in 
24 hours. A bad review in CR can hurt sales just as dramatically, as the 
importers of Sterling automobiles surely can attest. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, CR's tests from the previous year are gathered in a paperback book, 
the "Buying Guide," distributed free to subscribers. Now, for the first time, 
an oversized, large-type version of the "Buying Guide" is available. 
</P>
<P>
One can argue that CR by its very existence supports the notion that our most 
important function is to buy something (to be sure, in the case of CR readers, 
the right something). A more practical problem is that CR's judgments are not 
quite gospel when it comes to unquantifiable matters of taste. How do you rate 
the sounds produced by stereo amplifiers, or the taste of peanut butter? The 
testers work hard to nail down the elusive qualities of the perfect ice-cream 
bar, but hey, they make chocolate and vanilla in the first place because people 
agree to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
But these are quibbles. It's CR, after all -- not rich, powerful TV networks 
and stations, not most practitioners of daily print journalism -- that tells 
consumers the story advertisers don't, and regularly publishes lists of 
recalled, and often dangerous, merchandise, from a shockingly long list of 
children's toys to cars.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: TERRY SAVAGE TALKS MONEY BY TERRY SAVAGE (DEARBORN 
FINANCIAL PUBLISHING: $22.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER

<TEXT>
<P>
It's Sunday morning. Do you know where your money is, and what it's doing? 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, you don't. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have much, the worry is next week's bills. 
</P>
<P>
If you do, you probably turn over some control of your money to experts -- 
accountants or investment advisers of one sort or another -- who manage it for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, you can benefit from "Terry Savage Talks Money: The 
Common-Sense Guide to Money Matters." Savage is a business reporter for a 
Chicago TV station, and a registered investment adviser, but she writes in a 
language even a civilian can comprehend. Her TV training (make it fast, make it 
simple) may have helped her in putting together this book; it's basic stuff, 
and it's presented in easily digestible form. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Savage explains not only how to invest in Treasury Bills or notes 
but also how the payout of those instruments works. She's as clear on buying a 
house or a car, and, for anyone with a dime left over, investing in stocks and 
bonds, commodities, precious metals and real estate. Her cautionary attitude on 
the last category is in marked contrast, and a welcome antidote, to the 
pie-in-the-sky promises made by promoters, both on TV and in print. 
</P>
<P>
What Savage has to say may sound like eat-your-oatmeal to people who tend to 
spend today and worry tomorrow. But she's trying to protect your assets -- from 
your own carpe diem madness (why buy a T-bill when I can have a new Armani 
suit?) as well as from financial "experts" who manage to plunder the funds 
funneled through them. What Savage suggests is that we all invest wisely, 
whether a little or a lot; money is not some mystical language known only to a 
select few.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN MEMORY OF ANGEL CLARE BY CHRISTOPHER BRAM (PLUME: $9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this uneven novel, Christopher Bram attempts to tackle the daunting problem 
of how to cope with the loss of a young and talented person to AIDS. Months 
after the death of budding film director Clarence (Clare) Laird, his 
intellectual New York friends are getting on with their lives and careers, but 
his former lover, Michael Sousza, remains in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Clare's friends always regarded him as vacuous and self-involved, and they were 
apparently right. He remains a widowed cipher, displaying his grief like a 
purple heart. The reader soon tires of him, and joins the other characters in 
wishing Michael would get a life -- somewhere else. The narrative falters badly 
near the conclusion, as the action flashes backward, forward and sideways; Bram 
is obviously a capable writer, but he doesn't seem to know what he wants to say 
about the phenomenon of AIDS "widowhood."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SACRIFICIAL SMOKE BY JAN FRIDEGARD TRANSLATED BY ROBERT E. 
BJORK (UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA PRESS: $9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This volume completes Robert Bjork's translation of Swedish novelist Jan 
Fridegard's critically acclaimed "Holme" trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacrificial Smoke" focuses on the escalating conflict between Christianity and 
native Scandinavian paganism in 9th-Century Uppsala. As he seeks to free the 
thralls and limit the spread of Christianity in the small Viking kingdom, Holme 
represents a threat to both the established economic order and the nascent 
religious orthodoxy. The local chieftain and foreign missionaries plot his 
murder, but the dark, brooding smith is not an easy man to kill. "Sacrifical 
Smoke" recaptures the strength and tension that made the first book, "The Land 
of Wooden Gods," so compelling -- and was sadly lacking in the second, "People 
of the Dawn."

MORE HAWK THAN HUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dean Rusk and his son ("As I Saw It," reviewed by Michael R. Beschloss, June 
24) portray the former Kennedy-Johnson secretary of state as a kind of amiable 
Huck Finn from Oxford ("wearing hand-me-down, hand-sewn, flour-sack drawers" as 
a boy, as the reviewer puts it), but Beschloss fails to point out the 
distortion of such a self-serving self-portrait of Rusk as a gentlemanly 
near-Dove. 
</P>
<P>
Beschloss seems to have Rusk saying that Kennedy and Johnson betrayed the 
"honor" of the U.S. by declaring that "You are not going to take over South 
Vietnam by force," but then the reviewer suggests that Rusk was not the hawk on 
Vietnam he has been painted as being. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, I was under the impression that Johnson, with Rusk's help, did do 
his level best to "take over South Vietnam by force." 
</P>
<P>
But Beschloss is entirely in error when he suggests that Kennedy and Johnson 
were of the same ilk in prosecuting the Vietnam War: "Whatever future 
historians conclude about American decision-making on Vietnam . . . (they are) 
unlikely to favor Rusk or the two Presidents he served." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson aside, Kennedy's last decision on Vietnam -- made less than two months 
before he was assassinated -- was to begin the withdrawal of the American 
military from that nation, a process which was to be completed by the end of 
1965. Kennedy had started to do precisely what Nixon would be forced to do over 
a decade later -- declare the war won and get the hell out.

Two July 1 book reviews -- of "Coming Out Under Fire" by Allen Berube, and 
"Better Angel" by Forman Brown -- call for comment: 
</P>
<P>
To state that "The Mattachine Society . . . was formed by a group of veterans 
in 1950" omits those who were not veterans. Careful study of that important 
development must wait for thorough examination of the 25 file drawers of 
Mattachine Society records in ONE's Baker Memorial Library and Archives. 
</P>
<P>
The delightful account of "Better Angel" not only is valuable in its own right 
but by dating from 1933 has recorded how much liberated thinking had been going 
on long before World War II.

LITERARY HIT MEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Re book critics almost as reliable as the people who write the blurbs for film 
ads: 
</P>
<P>
Larry Ceplair's comments about Michael Herr's "Walter Winchell: A Novel" (May 
27) are a model of the nit-picking critique which makes so many of us 
(unfairly, perhaps) classify critics as literary "hit men" who dote on cutesy 
negativism. They too often get caught up in the cleverness of their put-downs 
and lose any sense of objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
I was asked by a local bookseller to read a pre-publication copy of "Walter 
Winchell" and advise her as to its worth. I read it . . . and found it 
interesting and great fun: not "great literature" but certainly entertaining 
reading. The unique format added to the enjoyment.

In his perceptive April 8 review of "The Cinema of Adventure, Romance and 
Terror," David Colker mentions that "some of the behind-the-scenes anecdotes . 
. . are suspect because the book is not footnoted and the sources . . . go 
mostly unnamed." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the material in my book is from primary sources, such as author 
conversations and interviews over a period of many years with personnel 
involved in production of the films and from information in studio files. . . . 
</P>
<P>
For example, our information on "The Most Dangerous Game" was obtained from the 
producer, the director, the music supervisor, four of the cameramen, two 
effects technicians, the first matte artist, a stuntman, two lead players and 
the RKO production files. 
</P>
<P>
We tried to avoid published sources and whatever secondary materials were used 
are attributed in the text. Further blame may be attached to the editor's 
college-days hatred of reading footnotes.

BEHIND THE SCENES OF REDISTRICTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current City Hall battle over redistricting has been presented in the press 
as an attempt by an insensitive majority to ride roughshod over the good 
government recommendations of an independent, virtuous, citizens' Redistricting 
Advisory Board (RAB). Let me set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the members of the RAB were good citizens, volunteering lots of time to 
their community. Unfortunately, the board quickly became dominated by a few 
professional political consultants who had a conscious agenda to pursue. In 
fact, the basic outline of their council district map was circulated among a 
few City Council offices well before the first meeting of the RAB. 
</P>
<P>
As the representative of the League of Women Voters pointed out, public 
testimony to the RAB that conflicted with this preconceived agenda was ignored. 
Secret caucuses were held in back rooms. No formal minutes of the proceedings 
were maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this charade of a public process came recommendations for a new council 
district map -- recommendations that soon achieved the status of the Ten 
Commandments handed down to Moses. The media has focused on only one aspect of 
the RAB's recommendations: the creation of a majority Latino district. That 
point is not at issue. Every member of the City Council supports that 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
What the media did not report are other -- highly objectionable -- features of 
the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
It was surprising that a committee that claimed to be empowering the Latino 
community deliberately weakened the political clout of that Latino district by 
removing the politically and economically critical areas of downtown and Balboa 
Park from its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The RAB's recommendations protected and enhanced the political futures of the 
most anti-environment and anti-neighborhood members of the City Council -- and 
created difficult districts for the most progressive council members. 
</P>
<P>
Its recommendations divided many neighborhoods into different council 
districts, insulated most districts from environmental concerns, segregated the 
city into "have" and "have not" districts, and dumped all the problems of our 
city's growth into just two council districts. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, several council members decided to try to fight this blatantly 
political redistricting map -- even if it came from an "independent" and 
"citizens' " advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
We joined a coalition of neighborhood, environmental, labor, gay, Latino and 
other minority activists committed to drawing district lines that create a 
majority Latino population, unite neighborhoods, build as many districts as 
possible with environmental concerns, and encourage each council member to be 
responsive to diverse economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting map that came out of this process is the 
neighborhood/environment or "Hartley" map. 
</P>
<P>
Which do you choose?

PICTURE IN ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The picture you ran accompanying your story on the Jackson Drive connection to 
Route 52 ("Jackson Drive Extension Stirs Debate," July 14) is totally 
inaccurate. That valley is precisely where the road is not going. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Drive winds its way through the far western edge of the park, out of 
sight and sound of this valley. 
</P>
<P>
The valley shown is designated for overnight camping, family and group 
picnicking. According to the master plan, Jackson Drive will provide access for 
those unable to hike into this area, "currently the most inaccessible, and to 
many people, unknown area of the park." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Drive has been in the park's master plan and the city's traffic 
circulation plan since 1960. The project was listed as one of the 12 local road 
projects that would be funded if Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax measure 
passed. Proposition A did pass, and the people expect those projects to be 
built ASAP. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent votes by the City Council listed Jackson Drive as a state 
matching-funds project. The council also voted to accelerate the project so 
that Caltrans will build the interchange with California 52. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are those who say that Mission Trails Regional Park is a preserve, 
not a park with active recreational uses. In fact, it is both, responding to 
"the public's increasing need for 'close-in' park opportunities by providing 
varied wilderness, interpretive and active recreational facilities." (Master 
Plan, 1985). 
</P>
<P>
Thus, because Jackson Drive will advance the park concept and relieve traffic 
congestion on I-8, I-15 and our residential streets, and because it was 
approved by the people with Proposition A, this critical connection to 
California 52 must be built without delay.

I love it!

<P>
The Giant Dipper is almost ready to roll and the developer says they "probably 
wouldn't have done it if the shopping hadn't been there" because "it was a real 
blighted area." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody mentioned good old Mike Gotch, long the subject of nasty remarks, 
attacked as if the development was the worst thing since slum housing. 
</P>
<P>
The center may not be the perfect solution, but given the economic situation of 
the time, Gotch really believed the development was a good compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he stepped on toes and was less politic than he might have been, but 
perhaps the end justified the means this time. 
</P>
<P>
The center is beginning to turn a corner; can no one be found to say that 
maybe, just maybe, Mike's decision was the best thing for Mission Beach?

OK, I'll say it: Mike, you were right.

MORE ROSEANNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With respect to Roseanne Barr's national anthem escapade, I am truly 
embarrassed by the people who booed her. 
</P>
<P>
However, embarrassment turned to confusion when President Bush publicly 
concluded that her singing was a disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it a greater disgrace for Bush's son to be involved in the billion-dollar 
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. scandal? To me, that is a real 
profound disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
At least Roseanne knew the words to the "Star-Spangled Banner." Do we have such 
short memories that we can't recall Pia Zadora's miserable attempt to sing the 
national anthem over network TV? She forgot the words, or didn't know them. 
</P>
<P>
My hat is off to you, Rosie. You sang your best and I, for one, appreciate your 
effort.

FAULTY BEARING ON LONDON'S BIG BEN HALTS MARCH OF TIME ON 3 OCCASIONS

It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that stopped the clock of Big Ben three 
times last week, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of Parliament stopped 
at 5:11 a.m. Friday, which is about where they snagged on Wednesday and 
Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this morning, that the 
problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern face of the clock, and that once 
that bearing has been replaced or lubricated, that the problem will go away," 
said Toby Sargent, spokesman for the Department of Environment. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ben is the name of the bell that tolls the hours, but the name is 
informally applied to the clock as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock broke down 
during the hottest days of the London summer. On Thursday, the temperature 
reached 97 degrees.

ISLAMIC CENTER OUTGROWING LOMITA BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN M. ROSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside a small, converted house in Lomita, a group of Muslim faithful wait for 
the sun to inch past its zenith, signaling the time for Friday jum'a prayers. 
</P>
<P>
As the ancient Arabic call to prayer is broadcast over a public address system, 
conversations grind to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
Basima Abdelkarim, a 17-year-old Palestinian whose family moved to Torrance 
five years ago, adjusts the traditional hijab scarf that covers her hair, slips 
off her shoes and crowds into the mosque with fellow Muslims from more than a 
dozen countries. 
</P>
<P>
By the time latecomers squeeze their cars into the parking lot, the rows of 
praying worshipers extend out the door. 
</P>
<P>
Narrow mats are hastily rolled out into the lot so congregants outside can join 
the service, prostrating themselves toward faraway Mecca and touching their 
foreheads to the faded rugs. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Hasan Ud Din Hashmi, a Pakistani scholar of Islamic studies who 
immigrated to California eight years ago, leads his nearly 200-strong 
congregation in reciting Islam's 1,300-year-old creed: 
</P>
<P>
"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet." 
</P>
<P>
Although the congregants come from places as different as Thailand and Morocco, 
this basic belief draws them to the Islamic Center of the South Bay each 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Islam is not different whether it's in Saudi Arabia, Iran or here in America," 
said Hashmi, recently appointed imam, or spiritual leader, of the Lomita 
mosque. 
</P>
<P>
The mosque, which attracts Muslims from all over the South Bay, is for many an 
oasis of familiarity in an alien, Christian-dominated society. 
</P>
<P>
Abdelkarim, who graduated from Torrance High School in June, said the center is 
a haven where she can socialize with other Muslims her own age and practice her 
religion at the same time. "Without the mosque, my life would be empty," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of Muslim immigrants, like Abdelkarim and her family, has 
helped to boost membership at the Lomita mosque from 30 families in 1985 to 100 
today. An additional 400 are on the center's mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
The small building on Walnut Avenue, purchased just five years ago, is already 
far too cramped for its burgeoning congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't realize there would be so many Muslims coming," said Zaffar 
Hassanally, a member of the board of directors and one of the center's 
founders. "We're out of space. It's packed." 
</P>
<P>
The center's beginnings date back to 1982, when Hassanally's family and a few 
friends starting meeting for prayers at each other's homes. 
</P>
<P>
As the numbers grew, the group rented progressively larger rooms wherever they 
could -- first in the Courtyard Mall in Rolling Hills Estates, then at the 
Torrance YMCA and finally at the Clark Stadium Community Building in Hermosa 
Beach. Finally, the congregation bought its Lomita property, tucked behind a 
7-Eleven store that fronts Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, we needed a permanent place where we could pray and also set up 
classrooms for the children," said Hassanally, who moved here from Pakistan and 
started a real estate firm in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on Muslim immigrants from around the world, the South Bay center is 
marked by tremendous ethnic and cultural diversity that contributes to a unique 
religious atmosphere, Hashmi said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no Kuwaitis in the congregation, Hashmi said there was 
concern at the mosque last Friday for fellow Muslims involved in the current 
conflict between Kuwait and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The center attempts to strip away cultural influences in its practice of Islam 
and concentrate instead on elements common to all Muslims, said Hashmi, who 
taught religion for 25 years in Pakistan before moving to California to study 
Islamic texts at UCLA. "From a religious point of view, this is good because we 
focus on basic fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
A distinctively American brand of Islam emerges in which common fundamentals 
prevail over sectarian religious differences, Hashmi added. 
</P>
<P>
Shiite immigrants from Iran and Sunni Muslims from Iraq, whose countries fought 
a long and bloody war fueled in part by religious differences, pray side by 
side in the Lomita mosque. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of the Lomita center mirrors a general increase in the number of 
mosques in Southern California. Maher Hathout, a spokesman for the Islamic 
Center of Southern California, the largest mosque in Los Angeles, noted that 
there are 30 mosques in Los Angeles County today, compared to only two 14 years 
ago. There are two other mosques in the South Bay, both in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of mosques is partly a result of Muslim immigration. 
Hathout estimated that 650,000 Muslims live in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
He said, however, that the new mosques are also due to a growing desire among 
Muslims to openly practice their religion. 
</P>
<P>
Hashmi said that Muslim immigrants, faced with American society and culture, 
want to keep their identity. "When they find Christians everywhere they want to 
find out more about their own religion. This is human psychology." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas many Muslims go to the Lomita mosque to preserve their identities, 
others are forging new ones. Sprinkled among the immigrants and 
first-generation Californians, who together constitute 90% to 95% of the South 
Bay congregation, are a number of American converts drawn to Islam from a 
variety of backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Some converts, like Lita Salbi, embraced Islam through marriage. Salbi, who 
grew up in a Methodist household in Venice, did not immediately convert when 
she married an Iraqi Muslim, Abdulrazzak Salbi, who sits on the center's board 
of trustees. It was only later, when the couple had their first child, that 
Salbi felt the need to raise her family within a single religious tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Salbi said she first attended a Muslim service about eight years ago and found 
Islam to be "an enhancement to a faith I already had." Among other things, it 
recognized the prophet status of Old and New Testament figures and resolved 
many of the doubts raised by her Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not take a religion just to satisfy a spouse," Salbi said. "It would 
have to be something I could feel comfortable about." After about a year of 
studying the religion, Salbi began to consider herself a Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
Salbi said devout Muslims do not drink alcohol, which is proscribed in the 
Koran. She said Muslins believe the Koran is the perfected word of God, 
revealed by Muhammad who is the last prophet. 
</P>
<P>
There is very little formality to conversion in Islam, Salbi noted. One need 
only recite the simple creed. 
</P>
<P>
Dawud Khalil-ullah, a director of the Lomita mosque, was attracted to Islam for 
different reasons. Like many African-Americans, he said, he finds a 
particularly resonant message in Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"Many African-Americans equate Christianity with white oppression," 
Khalil-ullah said. "Islam represents something different. Islam preaches and 
practices equality and justice for all people." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, African-Americans realize that many of their ancestors were 
Muslims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how they came to Islam, congregants of the mosque uniformly 
mentioned tensions routinely faced by a Muslim living in a Christian society. 
</P>
<P>
For women, wearing a head covering in public is just one example of how Muslim 
and American cultures can clash. Although Abdelkarim covers her hair during 
mosque services, she does not wear the hijab covering to school because she 
fears the reaction of other students. "Right now it's not easy. I would be 
labeled as alien," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yusef Nasouf, a 15-year-old boy born in Libya who now lives in Torrance, said 
his schoolmates are often curious about his religion. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Why do you believe in this? It's dumb,' they say. I say, 'It's my religion 
and you have yours. You have to respect mine,' " Nasouf said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the American workweek revolves around the Saturday and Sunday weekend, 
attending services on Friday -- the day Muslims gather at the mosque for 
special prayers -- is difficult for employees and nearly impossible for 
children during the school year, Hassanally said. However, he said, the mosque 
runs Sunday school classes for children where basic religion and Arabic are 
taught. 
</P>
<P>
Passing on the religious tradition to children growing up in America presents 
the center with its greatest challenge, Abdulrazzak Salbi said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet that challenge, the center would like to add a second floor to the 
mosque where large classrooms could be built. By eliminating classrooms and 
offices now on the first floor, the center could enlarge the sanctuary to cover 
the entire ground level. In addition, a small storage building in the parking 
lot would be razed to make room for more parking, Salbi said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a city zoning ordinance passed last year prohibits the center from any 
substantial renovation or expansion. The ordinance, which rezoned lots fronting 
Pacific Coast Highway to create a commercial-retail zone, also included a few 
adjacent lots. One of them was the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new zone excludes churches, the mosque is permitted to remain in 
its present state under a grandfather clause. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Walker Ritter said the city does not grant use variances, so 
the only way to get around the zoning would be a new ordinance specifically 
enacted for the mosque's lot. The city is unlikely to do that, Ritter said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosque officials are upset about the rezoning, saying it leaves them with few 
options. "They had no reason to include us," Hassanally said. "They could have 
gone just with the 7-Eleven in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they followed the borders of a previous commercial-general 
zone, which included the mosque property, when they defined the new zone. In 
addition, both city and mosque officials said the mosque raised no objections 
during public hearings held on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Although mosque officials acknowledge that they should have taken part in the 
zoning hearings, they say they perceive a common American distrust of Muslims, 
which they believe has disposed the city against the current expansion and some 
of the mosque's other plans in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"With a (Christian) church, they would be much more flexible, though some of it 
is our own fault," Khalil-ullah said. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter said Lomita welcomes churches of all religions and has not discriminated 
against the mosque in any fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Hassanally, who heads a committee to expand the center and has dealt with city 
officials in the past to obtain municipal permits for the mosque, said he felt 
some discrimination in his dealings with the city. "It's not overt, but I think 
it has some bearing," Hassanally said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Hassanally and other congregants recalled an incident last year 
when the city forced the mosque to take down a sign visible from Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The mosque in 1988 purchased a small strip of land that connects the original 
plot to the highway and is used for extra parking. The Planning Commission 
asked the mosque to remove a sign on this property which bore just the name of 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
"I think just the words 'Islamic Center' are strange to them," Abdulrazzak 
Salbi said. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Richard Kawasaki said the Planning Commission rejected the sign 
"mainly because they didn't need it. Their main address is on Walnut. It would 
have created traffic problems and confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki said the law does not specifically prohibit the sign but allows the 
commission discretionary power to review roadside signs for appropriateness of 
size, wording and placement. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being rebuffed by the city on the sign, Hassanally said he intends to 
file an application for the second-floor expansion. However, the city planning 
office has told him the request would almost certainly be turned down. 
</P>
<P>
The only alternatives left are to purchase adjacent parcels where expansion 
might be permissible or to sell the property and move elsewhere, Hassanally 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But congregants said they prefer to stay. Two years ago, the mosque paid off 
the mortgage on the main property and then invested $285,000 to buy the parking 
strip off Pacific Coast Highway with the intention of expanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We've grown used to Lomita," Abdulrazzak Salbi said. "It's close to the 
freeways and very convenient. In fact many Muslims live in the apartment 
building next door. . . . It's home to us."

EL CAMINO PUTS MORE TRUST IN ITS STUDENT TRUSTEE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE HAS DECIDED TO PAY ITS STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE, 
WHO WILL BE ALLOWED TO MAKE AND SECOND MOTIONS. BUT APPLICANTS MUST MEET 
TOUGHER ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS.

<P>
When Anthony Narcisse was student trustee representative last year at El Camino 
College, he could attend meetings and engage in debate with the college board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
But he could not cast a formal vote. Nor could he make or second motions. And 
while other trustees earned $400 a month, he earned nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in what some are hailing as a landmark change, El Camino trustees have 
approved new rules that expand the role of the student trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Narcisse's successor, Steven T. Nash, now is allowed to make and second 
motions. And he will be paid $200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
But he also must meet stiffer academic and eligibility standards, such as 
keeping his grades at an average of 2.5 or above. 
</P>
<P>
Students at a number of California community colleges have been advocating a 
larger role for student trustees, and the changes at El Camino followed months 
of student lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, who has been student trustee since spring, says the changes place El 
Camino in the top quarter of community colleges in the state in terms of the 
power and pay given the student trustee. He praised the trustees for taking the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
However, some student leaders argue that more stringent standards for the 
student trustee could limit the pool of eligible students, leaving out some of 
the growing number of part-time and minority students on the El Camino campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I gather they're looking for the cream of the crop," said Narcisse, who now 
lives near Atlanta. "They want students with significantly higher grade-point 
averages and students spending more time in the classroom. I don't think we 
need elite students being on that board. I think we need concerned students." 
</P>
<P>
Three student trustees in the last five years have been the only minority 
representatives on an all-Anglo board, said David Love, former student body 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Because many minority students attend El Camino part time, the new standards -- 
which include an increase in the course load required of a student trustee -- 
could exclude minority students disproportionately, Love said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Dunn, president of the board of trustees, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, we've broadened the pool, not limited it," Dunn said. 
For some students, he said, the $200-a-month pay for the student trustee could 
eliminate the need to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a trade-off," Dunn said. "We traded more units and a higher GPA in 
exchange for more power, more responsibility and a $200-a-month trustee fee." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said he hopes the changes will encourage communication between trustees 
and students. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, trustees come on campus only once a month. . . . They're almost 
closeted away," Dunn said. "Hopefully, this will give us a closer feeling to 
the student body as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino College has had a student trustee since 1978. But new interest in the 
post surfaced after 1988, when the Legislature passed a sweeping law aimed at 
reforming community college government. 
</P>
<P>
"It said we should establish a collegial system of government to include 
faculty, staff and students," said Ann Reed, vice chancellor for public affairs 
for the California Community Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying the pendulum is swinging back now, where people are getting 
more involved in their schools," said Duane Thompson, student member of the 
board of governors at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Other Southern California community colleges also have been scrutinizing the 
student trustee role. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica College last year gave its student trustee the power to make and 
second motions. This spring, the Ventura County Community College District 
increased student trustee pay from $100 to $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The student trustee for the nine-college Los Angeles Community College District 
is Joe N. Rudynski, a student at Harbor College in Wilmington. He now gets paid 
$500 monthly, compared to $2,000 for the other trustees. Rudynski currently 
cannot make or second motions, but the issue of the student's powers is about 
to be reviewed by a trustee committee, said Warren Kinsler, general counsel for 
the Los Angeles District. 
</P>
<P>
The student trustee slot is the "institutional identity of students," Rudynski 
said. The strengthening of a student trustee's authority in turn strengthens 
student identity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At El Camino, debate about the student trustee's role has been under way for 
more than a year, students said. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed July 23 to allow the student trustee to make and second 
motions, to have advisory votes recorded and to be paid $200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, the board also created new eligibility rules. 
</P>
<P>
To be a trustee, the student must be enrolled in at least seven semester units, 
up from a five-unit requirement in the past. The student also must have 
completed 12 units with a cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.5, up 
from 2.0. Previously, there was no limit on the number of terms a student 
trustee could serve, but the board ruled that the student can serve no more 
than a full one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board has granted new privileges, some trustees say they believe 
certain other powers should not be extended to the student member. Fox, for 
example, is opposed to inviting students into the board's executive sessions -- 
an issue that was not voted on last month. Under state law, students do not 
have access to executive sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"The executive session deals with budget matters, disciplinary things, 
personnel matters that get into very, very touchy matters," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
And Trustee Lila Hummel said she did not think the $200 pay was needed. "They 
have no legal responsibility as a student trustee. So, if they want to be paid, 
they can run for the office and take on the legal responsibility," Hummel said. 
</P>
<P>
The student trustee is elected yearly by students. The five regular El Camino 
trustees are chosen by voters in a districtwide election. 
</P>
<P>
Narcisse said he remembers feeling somewhat apart from the rest of the board. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated "cordially, but like a student," he recalled. "The reality of 
the situation is that the other board members don't see the student trustee as 
being a member of the board." 
</P>
<P>
Some students predict that the new eligibility rules -- by screening out some 
part-time students -- will lead to younger, full-time students serving as 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"Students here are getting older. I believe someone right out of high school 
doesn't have the big picture," said Robert L. Bethea Jr., president of the 
Associated Students, the student government, who says he is unhappy with many 
of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
The age of the average student at El Camino has risen from about 25 to 29 over 
the past decade, a school spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Part-time students carrying fewer than 12 units now make up 77% of the El 
Camino student body -- up from 63% in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
And whereas 65% were Anglo in 1979, that has dropped to 45% today. Another 19% 
of the current students are black, 16% are Latino and 14% are Asian, according 
to statistics supplied by the college. 
</P>
<P>
Those shifts have further fueled some students' concern about the new 
eligibility rules. 
</P>
<P>
At a student government meeting Wednesday, Love urged that a letter be sent to 
the trustees inquiring how the changes will affect minority students. Possible 
action was postponed until Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are we making standards when, to my knowledge, there's never been a 
problem with the student trustees?" Love asked in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
But Nash, the current trustee, said he is upset at what he called implications 
that the changes have a racial undertone. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees with the new eligibility requirements, he said. "If someone can't cut 
a 2.0 or a 2.5, it's going to be very hard for them to manage school and being 
a trustee."

Aspiring sand castle architects will get a chance to show off their skills in 
two contests this week in the South Bay. If the past is any guide, the fertile 
imagination of youngsters will produce a myriad of castles, dragons, mermaids, 
dinosaurs, octopuses and sea monsters. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we're expecting to see Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles," said Jim 
Graham, an organizer of Redondo Beach's eighth annual Sand Castle &amp; Design 
Competition, to be held Thursday. Today, Manhattan Beach sponsors its annual 
sand castle contest just south of Manhattan Beach pier, an event coordinated 
with the International Surf Contest also taking place this weekend. The sand 
castle contest, which begins at 9 a.m., will be divided by age groups, starting 
with a category for 5- through 8-year-olds. Teams that include participants of 
all ages will also be competing in separate divisions. The Redondo Beach 
competition will start at 10 a.m. Thursday at Seaside Lagoon. Children up to 
age 14 will compete in free-form and castle-building categories. Although other 
contests along the California shoreline often encourage more grandiose projects 
-- some even using bulldozers, cranes and backhoes -- the Redondo event is more 
in the spirit of an old-fashioned, low-tech family outing, Graham said. 
Admission for both contests is free. IAN ROSE

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBIL AMENDS BALLOT FINANCIAL REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. has filed an amended financial report for the campaign 
committee that helped defeat a March ballot measure aimed at banning the use of 
hydrofluoric acid at the company's Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The new report, received Thursday by the Torrance city clerk, corrected a 
discrepancy in an earlier report that was caused by a mathematical error, said 
Charles H. Bell Jr., a Sacramento attorney representing Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the Mobil Oil Corp. Refinery Safety Committee/No on 
Measure A collected a total of $710,238.78, all but $200 of it from Mobil. The 
committee received $644,895.07 in monetary contributions from Mobil and 
$65,343.71 in "non-monetary contributions," which Bell described as staff time 
of Mobil employees. 
</P>
<P>
The only contributors besides Mobil were David E. Novitski, a Mobil attorney 
and the committee's treasurer, who gave $100, and attorney Ernest J. Getto, who 
also gave $100, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The group spent $644,895.07, primarily on broadcast advertising, literature and 
polling, the report states. It reports no cash on hand as of June 30, the end 
of the reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure lost 3-1 in the March 6 Torrance election.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service on Friday 
reported cracking an alien-smuggling operation based in two East San Diego 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the smuggling ring and 16 suspected illegal aliens were 
arrested, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
INS officers entered houses in the 200 block of South 36th Street and the 3000 
block of Imperial Avenue at 4 p.m. Friday to make the arrests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The houses served as staging areas for multinational illegal aliens waiting to 
be transported to Los Angeles and then to final destinations across the 
country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
INS agents and San Diego police also pulled over a vehicle northbound on 
Interstate 5 near Del Mar Heights that they said contained two principal 
members of the smuggling ring and an illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants paid large fees to the smugglers for guaranteed passage 
to their destinations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
INS agents infiltrated the smuggling operation several months ago, officials 
said.

Two men forced their way into a Black Angus Restaurant Saturday morning, taking 
an undetermined amount of cash and locking employees inside a food freezer. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police said the two men confronted an employee at 8:41 a.m. as he 
arrived for work at the restaurant at 10370 Friars Road. 
</P>
<P>
The men, both wearing dark sunglasses and baseball caps, forced their way into 
the restaurant as the employee opened the door and locked the employees in a 
room, said Sgt. Fred England. Employees told police one of the suspects had a 
scraggly beard and carried a sawed-off rifle or shotgun and appeared to be in 
his 30s. The other was clean shaven and looked to be in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
The men took money from the restaurant's accountant working in the manager's 
office and then placed all six employees into the restaurant's food freezer. 
The employees forced the freezer lock open about 20 minutes after the suspects 
fled. No shots were fired and no one was injured.

a van in the 1600 block of Kraft Street by two men, one of whom was identified 
as her ex-boyfriend, George Rios, 20, of Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
After sending investigators to Tijuana Wednesday night, Oceanside police closed 
the case after determining that Martinez was with Rios because she wanted to 
be.

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Sheriff's deputies are investigating an apparent murder-suicide in 
Cameron Corners near Campo on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified citizen flagged down Sheriff Patrol Deputy William C. Smith at 
about 5 p.m. after the residents of the home located in the 1700 block of 
Buckman Springs failed to keep a morning appointment, said Lt. John Tenwold. 
</P>
<P>
On entering the home, Smith discovered the body of a white man who appeared to 
be in his 60s and a white woman in her 50s. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were not identified pending notification of relatives. Sheriff's 
deputies are continuing their investigation.

NO OUTCRY OVER CUTS IN COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is wrong with this picture? On July 25, the budget for the next fiscal 
year was presented to the Orange County Board of Supervisors. It called for a 
5% across-the-board cut. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the public safety portion of the budget was followed 
immediately by eloquent appeals from the district attorney, sheriff and public 
defender. They all pointed out the devastating consequences of such a cut on 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the health-care budget, also reduced by 5%. There was not 
one single comment from any member of the Health Care Agency. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
Is there room for a 5% cut while still providing adequate health-care services 
to the residents of Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the county that lost one of its trauma care centers this year and 
now must send Orange County trauma victims to Los Angeles County? 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the county that has seen closure of emergency rooms in low-income 
communities? 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the county where there is virtually no provision for non-emergency 
care for indigent adults? 
</P>
<P>
Is this not the county where poor children with serious health problems must 
wait weeks, or even months, for appointments to overcrowded clinics? 
</P>
<P>
If this is that county, why the deafening silence from the Health Care Agency? 
</P>
<P>
Is there a relationship between these problems, the silent Health Care Agency, 
and the more than 20 individuals who rose to speak when public comment was 
requested? 
</P>
<P>
What do the Orange County Medical Assn., Hospital Council, Share Our Selves, 
California Health Decisions, United Way, the March of Dimes Birth Defect 
Foundation, and UCI Medical Center (and 16 other health-care providers and 
consumer groups) know that the county of Orange does not know? 
</P>
<P>
I am left wondering which conveyed the loudest message: the public outcry or 
the county silence?

OUSTED SCHOOL CHIEF'S PROBLEM -- SHE WAS GUILTY OF EXCELLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let the punishment fit the crime, we always say! At the Huntington Beach City 
School District board meeting, there was another "victory for mediocrity" as 
the school board announced the resignation of the superintendent, Diana Peters 
("Beleaguered Schools Chief Diana Peters Resigns Post," July 26). 
</P>
<P>
And she was guilty all right -- guilty of excellence, guilty of leadership and 
guilty of commitment to kids. 
</P>
<P>
According to spokesmen for the teachers' union, "she spent too much time on 
public relations." Well, from the business community's perspective, what she 
did was to convince us that we shared responsibility for the quality of 
education in our local schools, that we couldn't just send our kids to school 
and expect the teachers and staff and the board (she always called them a team) 
to do it alone, especially with the perpetual shortage of funds. 
</P>
<P>
She implored, extolled and convinced us to care enough to contribute thousands 
of dollars in much-needed sophisticated equipment, supplies and special 
educational programs and thousands of hours of volunteer time -- of that, she 
was definitely guilty. 
</P>
<P>
If all this wasn't bad enough, Peters' "crimes" attracted so much public 
attention! Her leadership, coupled with the efforts of the principals and 
teachers in the district, resulted in the development of an innovative 
"Teaching for Thinking" program that was featured on the "Today" show; its 
Gifted Program was named an "exemplary program" in the state Report of School 
Readiness. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peters has been honored by the California Assn. for the Gifted with 
an award for Distinctive Service, was appointed by State Schools Supt. Bill 
Honig to two major state-level education task forces, and was honored by the 
California Legislature as the 58th Assembly District's "1990 Woman of the 
Year." 
</P>
<P>
For those "crimes," the Huntington Beach City School District board was willing 
to spend more than $150,000 to buy out the remainder of Peters' four-year 
contract, which they had just renewed last September amid great fanfare and 
with an outstanding performance review. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
But as we said, she was guilty of excellence, and we just can't have that in 
Huntington Beach.

COUNTY PLANNING: PATTERN OF BLUNDERS; 
</P>
<P>
UNSEEMLY ACTIONS, LAND-USE FUMBLES ARE DISTURBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is turning out to be a year when the public is learning some very 
disturbing things about how business is done with and by the Orange County 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
We've heard about planners riding in the golf carts of developers, and seen the 
district attorney investigate allegations that some commissioners had a hand in 
a fund-raiser for a political candidate. There is the continuing saga of the 
Laguna Niguel land transfer, a kind of summer mystery novel whose recent 
chapters strongly suggest that it was county planners who dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
All of this inevitably affects public perceptions, raising doubts about the 
competence and fairness of the process for all. Just ask the new homeowners in 
Laguna Niguel who now find that they have bought houses on 96 acres supposedly 
set aside for open space. 
</P>
<P>
Can others like them make real estate choices confidently when they know that 
county commissioners are taking freebies from developers and have fumbled away 
public land? The Laguna Niguel case adds questions of staff thoroughness to 
those already raised about commissioners' cozy relations with developers. 
</P>
<P>
The land transfer is not all the county's fault, of course. There are problems 
at the local level that the district attorney is investigating. The 
questionable stroke of the pen by James F. Krembas, formerly Laguna Niguel 
Community Services District vice president and now Laguna Niguel councilman, is 
inadequately explained by his statement that he believed it was part of another 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
But it has also become apparent in the weeks since the scandal broke that 
county planners fell down much earlier in their obligation to the public. This 
failure unquestionably invited the current mess, with or without the 
compounding error of Krembas. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of communication between county planning staffers and county 
planning commissioners on matters of vital interest to the public is a central 
point in the Laguna Niguel fiasco, as far back as 1985. We now know, from the 
curious explanations offered by key players, that Planning Commission staffers 
recommended that the commission approve a revision proposed by Taylor Woodrow 
Homes, without pointing out that the houses would be built on designated open 
space, and without requiring a new environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The former manager of that staff work has offered the lame explanation that 
because there were no rare or endangered species on the site, and because 
traffic and the number of units were projected to be the same, there was no 
need to raise the open-space question with commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
But don't just blame the planning staff. It's the responsibility of approving 
commissioners to anticipate problems that may be raised by staff reports on 
previous agreements, such as the one that was in place for the Laguna Niguel 
land. The public could have been spared all the trouble by a skeptical 
commission that asked whether there were any problems with the land. But 
commissioners appear to have waved the revision through. 
</P>
<P>
This year's revelations raise important doubts about the approaches of Orange 
County planners to land-use questions. Until the public is assured of better 
communication between commission and staff, and until there is some sense that 
commissioners keep their distance from developers, homeowners and those who 
care for Orange County's environment are right to rest uneasily.

RECLAIMING CARTS FROM THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read your article on Viva Mart's reclaiming of its shopping carts with 
concern and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that the homeless have a need. 
</P>
<P>
At least the homeless who are victims of circumstance and not homeless by 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
However, the shopping carts represent a financial investment on the part of the 
supermarket. They are purchased for use by the customers of that market. 
</P>
<P>
Once removed from the property of the market without their permission, the cart 
is stolen property. When did it become illegal to reclaim stolen property? 
</P>
<P>
If a homeless person puts their possessions in my car, does that make the car 
theirs? Am I subject to a lawsuit by Legal Aid if I remove their belongings and 
reclaim my car? 
</P>
<P>
Some good will came out of the situation because the market will be working 
with the homeless. Good by virtue of blackmail, however, is not what this 
country is supposed to be all about. They had no right to the carts, and by 
threatening a lawsuit and the attending publicity, Legal Aid blackmailed the 
market into cooperation.

LAW OF ECONOMICS PLAYS HAVOC WITH STATE'S MEDI-CAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial "Medi-Cal Rejection in County Shameful" (July 29) was too 
simplistic in its presentation. You made it seem like it is the fault of 
doctors and hospitals that there is inadequate health care for Medi-Cal 
recipients in our county; yet, I have never heard you claim that it is the 
fault of landlords and developers that we have homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of Medi-Cal contracting with hospitals is complex and 
non-intuitive. It may well be that Fountain Valley Regional Hospital will 
continue to serve Medi-Cal patients at a higher reimbursement rate without a 
Medi-Cal contract than with one. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that the state planners have seriously considered canceling all 
Medi-Cal contracts in Orange County so that each hospital will have to take its 
share of Medi-Cal patients. Many of these hospitals will receive a higher 
Medi-Cal rate without a contract than with one. 
</P>
<P>
Another large Orange County hospital has just signed a Medi-Cal contract. The 
medical staff at that hospital is concerned that a large number of Medi-Cal 
recipients may inundate their facility once the word gets out about the 
contract, creating another Fountain Valley situation. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that many physicians do treat Medi-Cal patients; we just do not 
advertise the fact. Doctors are concerned that a reputation of accepting 
Medi-Cal patients may have a negative impact on their colleagues and private 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Today's problems of poverty, medical indigence and homelessness were not 
created by the medical community, and these problems will not be solved by that 
community alone.

HOW TO PREVENT CHILD DROWNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Children Drowning Spurs Crusades for Safe Pools" (July 29): When we hear 
and read about drownings or near drownings of children in this county, we too 
are saddened. Of course, it is a terrible thing to read about, not to mention 
the actual families that become the victims. 
</P>
<P>
But with every incident, our question is, "Why don't they teach their kids how 
to swim?" We just don't understand why these people have pools and their kids 
don't know how to swim! It really doesn't make any sense. 
</P>
<P>
We have a pool in our back yard. We spent about $25,000 on our pool and about 
the same on our landscaping to make our back yard beautiful. This is part of 
our house design. We do not want to have to put a fence around our pool. 
</P>
<P>
We do not have any children. We have a secluded back yard with a large wooden 
fence all around to keep people out, and our neighbors who do have children all 
have pools, but those children are old enough to swim on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of passing a law that forces every homeowner with a pool to put up a 
fence and/or pool cover, why not pass a law that says they have to teach their 
kids how to swim? This makes more sense. 
</P>
<P>
Children can be taught how to swim at the age of 5 months. It's a natural thing 
to get babies used to water and not be afraid of it. By the time children are a 
year old and can walk, start teaching them extensively to swim, so that if a 
situation arises and for that (average of) 45 seconds while their supervisors 
have turned their backs and the kids fall in the pool, they can keep their 
heads above the water.

LAW OF ECONOMICS PLAYS HAVOC WITH STATE'S MEDI-CAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times certainly has a hard time understanding doctors. In the same issue, 
you print Art Silk's eloquent letter explaining the profession's feelings about 
the physician discipline problem ("Misdiagnosing a Quackery Cure," July 29) and 
a dumb editorial that says that it is "shameful" for doctors and hospitals to 
limit their losses in treating Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Silk always says it better than I could, but let me try. We are not 
unwilling to treat the poor, and most of us do. Before Medi-Cal, the poor 
received good medical care in doctors' offices and the county hospitals, plus 
those nonprofit hospitals which had received federal Hill-Burton funds for 
construction. For-profit hospitals are not obligated to care for the poor, but 
most do so anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A direct result of the Medi-Cal program was the starving and, in Orange County, 
the closing of county hospitals. The poor were supposed to receive "mainstream 
care," and so the county hospital wasn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the promise hasn't been kept. The program (at least the benefits 
part) is underfunded, the arrogant bureaucracy is bloated and the providers 
(doctors and hospitals) are treated like felons. 
</P>
<P>
Recently a patient was referred to me for major vascular surgery. She is on 
Medi-Cal because of total disability. I accepted her as a patient even after my 
office told me that they had been trying for three years to obtain payment from 
Medi-Cal for a previous operation (same operation, other side) on this patient. 
</P>
<P>
Will I ever be paid? Who knows? Will I let the world know that I will take all 
comers and treat them all for nothing? Not on your life! 
</P>
<P>
Most internists and GPs in my area don't even bill Medi-Cal for office visits 
because it costs more to collect than the state will pay for the service. That 
is what is "shameful!" 
</P>
<P>
Can you really blame them for not advertising the fact that they all take care 
of some of these patients for no charge? We who practice in affluent areas pity 
our colleagues who must depend on Medi-Cal for a large share of their practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Times would do better to study the real problems with the Medi-Cal program 
and to try to understand that the laws of economics apply to medicine too.

I have something to tell the crusaders for "Safe Pools": You can't legislate 
against stupidity! 
</P>
<P>
Leaving your child alone by a pool for even three seconds is just plain stupid. 
No law, fence, or alarm will help you. 
</P>
<P>
If you are careless enough to leave your child alone by a pool without a fence, 
you will be careless enough to leave your child alone by a pool with a fence. 
</P>
<P>
It is sad that the children pay the price for their parents' lack of care.

THE MAN BEHIND THE MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call Steve Martin the comic as magician. It's hard to imagine any performer 
today who captures both the physical grace of silent comedy and the cool irony 
of modern-day humor. Even when he's performing a silly scene, walking a quartet 
of Afghans with a huge bandage wrapped around his head, Martin displays a 
quiet, contemplative dignity. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes everything look so easy," says director Mick Jackson with obvious 
delight. "He hones every little movement to perfection. When the dailies aren't 
synced up, we often watch them without the sound. And when Steve's on screen 
it's like you're watching a silent movie. He has the body language and physical 
grace you've always associated with Chaplin." 
</P>
<P>
Away from the set, shoulder hunched, shuffling painfully through a Beverly 
Hills eatery, Martin has momentarily lost that special physical grace. "I 
exercised today for the first time in two months," he says, gingering taking a 
booth at the far corner of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a sienna jacket and beige slacks, with Steven Naifeh and Gregory White 
Smith's biography of Jackson Pollack under his arm, Martin is candid enough to 
admit he can't wait to finish making the movie. "It's not that I'm not enjoying 
it," he says, sipping an iced tea. "But the last day of a movie -- it's like 
getting out of school. Finals are over." 
</P>
<P>
He grinned, a bit uneasily. "There's a certain amount of torment that goes into 
the whole process of making a film. You go from agony to state of grace -- and 
back again." 
</P>
<P>
Martin has the whole process mapped out. "When you're writing, especially 
writing with no deadline -- that's a state of grace. When you get a deadline, 
that's agony. Going to dailies when you're shooting -- state of grace. But 
seeing the rough cut -- that's agony. Re-editing -- state of grace. Showing it 
to an audience." He sighs audibly. "Agony." 
</P>
<P>
As Martin tells it, he began working on "L.A. Story" even before he wrote 
"Roxanne," but put it aside for several years. "First I get this image of the 
script -- not a complete vision, but a tone," he says. "Then I do a 
half-(baked) plotting out and write a first draft from beginning to end which 
is always awful." 
</P>
<P>
A broad grin. "Then I do the years of refinement." 
</P>
<P>
Martin visualizes "L.A. Story" as a fanciful romantic comedy. "It's love not as 
it really is, but as we wish it was," he says. "I've always had a special 
fondness for the romantic comedies of the 40's, and I think it's because we 
wish we were in those situations." 
</P>
<P>
If Martin satirizes L.A. throughout his film, it's with a tantalizing mix of 
cynicism and affection that neatly captures the mixed feelings most Angelinos 
have toward their town. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that love-hate attitude comes from the guilt of being so comfortable 
against a responsibility for having culture," he says. "I have a line in the 
film where a character says 'There are no plays in L.A.' And someone asks, 'How 
many plays did you see last year?' He says, 'Four.' And they respond, 'Well, 
were they any good?' " 
</P>
<P>
At 44, Martin has a curious ambivalence about the value of culture. He rests 
comfortably in the upper niche of Hollywood stardom. He has an expansive art 
collection, can quote his favorite New Yorker writers and expound on the 
architectual loss of California bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he's also a comic actor, a breed that rarely gets respect in Hollywood and 
whose work is geared toward as broad an audience as possible. "I don't think 
there's anything wrong with making movies that are accessible to people," he 
says. "I think comedy teaches you to make your ideas clear -- what's the point 
of doing obscure jokes? My movies are meant to reach an audience. And I think 
they have quality." 
</P>
<P>
He laughs. "They just lack hardware." 
</P>
<P>
A man who rarely gives the public a glimpse of his private passions, it's hard 
to tell how much Martin identifies with the character he's created for himself 
in "L.A. Story." The film depicts a lonely guy, adrift in the chic, 
trend-obsessed world of Los Angeles. At the beginning of the film, Martin 
introduces him with a voice-over: "I was deeply unhappy," he says. "But I 
didn't know it because I was so happy all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about that line, Martin fell silent for a moment. "I guess it captures a 
mood of quiet desperation," he said finally. "It's very easy to go along in 
life-working, talking, getting married -- and never pausing to say, 'What 
should I really be doing?' 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. can do that to you. One day you look back and say, 'What did I do for the 
last ten years, except figure out to how make a left turn on Santa Monica 
Blvd.?' "

THE CALIFORNIA TEA PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
SMALL PROPERTY VERSUS BIG GOVERNMENT SOCIAL ORIGINS OF THE PROPERTY TAX REVOLT 
BY CLARENCE Y.H. LO (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $30; 270 PP.; 
0-0520-05971-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gladwin Hill, Hill, a consultant on writing at USC, has reported on 
California and national politics for many years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A weak link in democracy is politicians' extravagance with public funds, in 
combination with their occupational adroitness in avoiding public 
accountability. Individually, all spending proposals seem plausible; they all 
benefit somebody. But add them all up and you have the national debt and more. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in American history has this baneful phenomenon precipitated spectacular 
outbursts of citizen indignation. One occasion was the Boston Tea Party. The 
other was the California taxpayers' revolt of 1978 that produced Proposition 
13, the statutory brake on property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, politicians and bureaucrats tend to turn green at the mention of 
Prop. 13. It represents not only a leash on their extravagance, it also 
represents the persisting potential of an enraged citizenry to stomp on 
governmental excesses. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians, and others, think of Prop. 13 as an aberration -- an 
undercurrent of public vexation with taxes that just converged fortuitously 
with the messianic energies of Howard Jarvis to form a critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Lo, currently a sociobiologist at the University of Missouri, 
demonstrates trenchantly that the Prop. 13 revolt was far more than that. It 
was truly, he says, "a reenactment of the Boston Tea Party" -- an uprising 
against taxation without representation. 
</P>
<P>
Not only in California but across the nation, property taxes had become the 
politicians' bottomless bank account. Need money for some boondoggle? Just 
raise property assessments or the tax rate. If citizens protested, spit in 
their eye. (Los Angeles County Assessor John R. Quinn, Lo says, chortled 
sadistically to one protest group in 1957: "If you think taxes are high now, 
wait till next year." And when a tax objector raised a question of 
constitutionality, the assessment appeals board's snotty response was: 
"Constitution overruled!") 
</P>
<P>
California's real-estate boom after World War II threatened to put many a 
homeowner in the poorhouse. A house that cost $40,000 might be repeatedly 
reassessed on its presumed market value until an original $200 annual tax 
soared to a back-breaking $6,000. The system was capricious. At the same time 
Beverly Hills residents were paying $1.05 per $100 assessed valuation, far less 
affluent people in Alhambra were being dinged $3.98. (Prop. 13 established a 
basic limit of 1%.) 
</P>
<P>
A number of books have been written about the pros and cons of Prop. 13, but 
none has delved deeply into the grass-roots origins of the tidal wave of 
sentiment that Jarvis rode into history. As a UCLA faculty member, Lo obtained 
grants to finance seven years of exhaustive research. Taking Los Angeles 
County, the heart of the tax revolt, as his laboratory, Lo combed newspapers 
for reports of taxpayer protests back to the 1950s. He tabulated these, 
correlating them with economic levels by census tracts. From newspapers and 
other sources, he pinpointed hundreds of "activists" in the tax-reduction 
movement, leading to about 120 interviews by him and several assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Organized tax resistance surfaced a full generation before its culmination in 
1978. But for two decades middle-class protestations -- including tax-reduction 
campaigns by Jarvis and others, even County Assessor Philip Watson -- came to 
naught. Then in the 1970s, two new elements entered the picture. Small-business 
people and affluent homeowners became aware that they too were being crunched 
by property taxes. (Big business, from the Bank of America on down, fought 
Prop. 13 to the end.) 
</P>
<P>
Jarvis was a businessman of many parts who had ended up in 1972 as executive 
director of a Los Angeles apartment-house-owners' association. In collaboration 
with Prop. 13 co-author Paul Gann, Jarvis, Lo recounts, "succeeded in forging a 
consensus between small residential property owners and community leaders." The 
resulting three-way alliance of middle-class homeowners from West Covina to Van 
Nuys, and small-businessmen and upper-middle-class people from Palos Verdes to 
Los Angeles' affluent West Side, ultimately proved invincible. The San Fernando 
Valley alone produced more than half the 500,000 signatures needed statewide to 
put Prop. 13 on the ballot. It carried by a 2-1 margin, yielding $7 billion in 
tax relief the first year. It didn't seem to bother many people, then or now, 
that business gained twice as much from the reduction as homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 13 not only carried California but touched off a nationwide prairie fire. 
Within the next couple of years, nearly all 50 states enacted tax-reduction or 
tax-limiting laws. The movement ballooned into current pressures for a federal 
constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets, and had many other 
impacts. California enacted the Gann Amendment, tying state spending to state 
revenues. Lo sees the Prop. 13 revolt as a significant strand in the recent 
upsurge of business activism in politics, and the new focus of citizen 
attention on the Internal Revenue Service as "a symbol of abusive government." 
</P>
<P>
The momentum of Prop. 13 can be seen in the Prop. 103 attack on auto-insurance 
rates. Jarvis died in 1986, but his spirit marches on in the Howard Jarvis 
Taxpayers Assn., spearheading opposition to the ceaseless attempts to water 
down Prop. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Lo's book, while it has many dramatic vignettes, is hardly spicy recreational 
reading, but it is a fine example of practical scholarship -- a brass-tacks 
inquiry into a political eruption that has been short-shrifted and 
oversimplified. It could be a useful handbook for citizen groups on the perils 
and promise of fighting City Hall. And it documents the fact that California's 
citizenry truly deserves a place in history alongside the be-feathered 
colonists of the Boston Tea Party.

ANTI-GAY MESSAGE GOES UNCHALLENGED; 
</P>
<P>
SHOULD THE RECORD INDUSTRY'S REACTION TO GAY-BASHING BY RAP AND HEAVY-METAL 
GROUPS MIRROR ITS REACTION TO RACIAL AND ETHNIC SLURS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Elton John called comedian and sometime rocker Sam Kinison a "pig" on the 
recent "International Rock Awards," gay activists called John's statement a 
long overdue response to what they say is "gay-bashing" in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
The pop charts have too often been a forum for artists engaging in anti-gay 
hatred, at a time when violent incidents against homosexuals are on the rise, 
activists interviewed by The Times say. 
</P>
<P>
Songs and comments by heavy-metal bands Guns N' Roses, Skid Row and Cinderella 
top the list of offensive statements. The comedy of Kinison, whose last two 
comedy albums have included heavy metal send-ups of rock classics such as "Wild 
Thing" and "Mississippi Queen," has raised the ire of gay groups more than 
once. 
</P>
<P>
Even pop artists generally considered to be politically aware have come under 
attack. Songs such as "Money for Nothing" by Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler and 
"On Any Other Day" by the Police also have been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
Rap artists Ice-T, Big Daddy Kane, 2 Live Crew, Heavy D, Slick Rick, Chuck D., 
Professor Griff, Schoolly D and Kool G Rap also have been accused of promoting 
anti-homosexual messages on records and stage or in interviews, according to 
black gay and lesbian groups. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by increasing anti-gay song lyrics and remarks and by record company 
executives' tacit approval of anti-gay attitudes, activists argue that the 
industry consistently fails to react to performers' homophobia the way it 
frequently does when presented with racial and ethnic slurs. 
</P>
<P>
If performers substituted racial or ethnic expletives for the anti-gay terms 
"blithely" used in pop songs, "the industry would react with vocal outrage," 
says Adam Block, rock columnist for the Los Angeles-based Advocate, the 
nation's most prominent gay magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, this is a country which believes in artistic freedom," said 
Alan Bell, editor and publisher of BLK magazine, a Los Angeles-based national 
black gay and lesbian publication. "But on the other, we don't believe in 
bashing minorities. So what do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Last January, in response to charges of anti-Semitism and other forms of racial 
insensitivity and bigotry surrounding ethnic slurs in an interview with Public 
Enemy member Professor Griff, CBS Records chief executive Walter Yetnikoff sent 
a memo to more than 7,000 CBS employees asking for a dialogue on what the 
company policy should be in this area. The move was widely applauded by other 
label chiefs, some of whom said they intend to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
But gay activists maintain that little has been done. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, it's open season on gays," Block said. "Look at Skid Row or 
Guns N' Roses -- how much of a career killer is it when pop music artists 
verbally bash gay people in public?" 
</P>
<P>
Homosexuals were the targets last year of more than 7,000 anti-gay incidents 
ranging from verbal abuse to violence, according to a recent report from the 
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Anderson, outreach chairwoman for the Los Angeles branch of the Gay and 
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) maintains that explicit bigotry 
abounds in rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Founded six years ago in New York, GLAAD now has nine chapters across the 
country, including the Los Angeles chapter, which processes about 500 calls a 
week on a local hot line for comments about the presentation of gays in the 
popular media. 
</P>
<P>
GLAAD studies reveal that the typical gay-basher tends to be a white male 
between 16 and 25 years of age, the same demographic to which heavy-metal music 
appeals, Anderson points out. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some incidents involving heavy-metal music and alleged homophobia 
frequently cited by the activists: 
</P>
<P>
* Sebastian Bach, lead singer of the Atlantic Records band Skid Row, was 
chastised by gay groups after a heavy-metal magazine ran a snapshot of him 
wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan: "AIDS kills (gays) dead." 
</P>
<P>
* Cinderella, a best-selling band that records for PolyGram Records, irked gay 
activists after drummer Fred Coury espoused anti-gay opinions during an 
interview in a heavy-metal magazine earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Guns N' Roses came under fire last year after writing and recording "One in a 
Million" for Geffen Records, an angry rock narrative replete with slurs against 
gays and blacks. During subsequent interviews and live performances in which 
lead singer Axl Rose attempted to defend his creative intentions, his 
statements only upset activists more. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the band was removed from the line-up of a Gay Men's Health 
Crisis AIDS benefit, David Geffen, the president of their record company, 
resigned as chairman of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen, an AIDS philanthropist, explained his position in an interview in 
Entertainment Weekly: "I don't care what their record was," he said. "If you 
need a blood donor and the only person who can give you a transfusion is 
Hitler, you take the blood." 
</P>
<P>
Block, the Advocate columnist, says he finds the anti-gay attitude promoted by 
metal acts particularly offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Metal music is a medium which targets young males at a point in their lives 
when they feel sexually confused and ambiguous," Block said. "In order to allay 
any fear that they may be gay themselves, metal creates these fantasies of 
gay-bashing and power over women -- it's part of the musical ethos." 
</P>
<P>
But heavy metal hasn't cornered the market on homophobia, gay activists say. 
Block notes that some of the same macho, anti-gay bragging prevalent on the 
heavy-metal circuit exists in rap music too. 
</P>
<P>
A song by the group Audio Two contains this passage: 
</P>
<P>
 I can't understand why you're lookin' this way 
</P>
<P>
 What's the matter with you boy, are you gay? 
</P>
<P>
 Yo, I hope that ain't the case 
</P>
<P>
 'Cause gay mothers get punched in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 -- from Audio Two's "Whatcha' Lookin' At?" 
</P>
<P>
 In recent issues, BLK, the Los Angeles-based, national black gay and lesbian 
publication, has reported a number of anti-gay, rap-related incidents: 
</P>
<P>
* Ice-T angered activists during a concert on a recent Australian tour when he 
allegedly gave his approval to "bash poofs," according to BLK magazine. 
</P>
<P>
* Big Daddy Kane's song "Pimpin' Ain't Easy" came under fire for lyrics such 
as: "The Big Daddy law is anti-(gay). That means no homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
* Activists also point the finger at Heavy D for his song "More Bounce," which 
states he is "extremely intellectual, not bisexual" and that his listeners can 
"be as happy as a (gay) in a jail." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Williams is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of 
Southern California in the Program for the Study of Women and Men in Society. 
He teaches a class at USC called "Gender and Sexuality as an Issue in American 
Public Life." 
</P>
<P>
Williams notes that the sudden onslaught of anti-gay pop music and comedy 
mirrors the ambiguity that exists in American society regarding the emergence 
of a public and vocal homosexual community. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a homophobic culture and the kind of hateful messages we're concerned 
with here are a reflection of the nervousness that society feels about gay 
people," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that artists who perform this type of material not only reflect 
and reinforce what the society already thinks, they select and escalate the 
saturation of such thoughts in the culture." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he wished that artists and record companies that promote anti-gay 
messages in their work would realize that they are not operating in a social 
vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
"Record companies understand the limits of what is right and wrong," Williams 
said. "I don't think Sam Kinison would be caught ridiculing black people. I 
don't hear anybody putting out songs about beating up blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists have to start factoring in other realities. For instance, the question 
of violence," Williams added. "Right now there are a lot of hate crimes going 
on against specific minorities, gays included. I really do believe that there 
is the possibility that hate material may incite violence." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, following a performance by Arista recording artists Snap at a 
Boston gay nightclub called Buddies, Turbo Harris, the rap group's singer, 
allegedly shouted anti-gay remarks, choked Dennis Moreau, the club owner, and 
kicked club employee Kevin Riley in the ribs, according to Buddies manager Mark 
Eacobacci. The anti-gay incident has set off a boycott of Snap's music at radio 
stations and clubs throughout the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Jenkins, senior director of national publicity for Arista Records, said 
the group has apologized to the club owner and offered to perform a benefit 
concert at Buddies, the proceeds of which are to be donated to the fight 
against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"This incident was the result of a misunderstanding," Jenkins said. "Turb B is 
not anti-gay." 
</P>
<P>
Eacobacci acknowledged that a spokeswoman for Arista apologized to the club, 
but said that Buddies' management has no intention of allowing Snap to perform 
at Buddies again. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the artists who have allegedly been criticized for anti-gay expressions 
declined to be interviewed by The Times. Representatives for Guns N' Roses, 
Skid Row, Cinderella, Audio Two and Ice-T all turned down repeated requests for 
interviews. In addition, executives from PolyGram, Atlantic, A&amp;M, Arista, 
Capitol and Geffen Records declined repeated requests for interviews for this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Rap artist Heavy D was unavailable for comment, but his manager, Steve Lucas, 
said the rapper was sorry for any unintentional slap at gays. 
</P>
<P>
"What Heavy D said was meant to be playful, not derogatory," Lucas said. "He is 
not into gay-bashing. If we offended anybody, we apologize." 
</P>
<P>
Big Daddy Kane also described his "Pimpin' Ain't Easy" as a gag. "Rap songs 
don't always have to have a message," Kane said. "They can be done for pure 
entertainment or just to get a laugh. This was not meant to offend anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But Rich Miller, manager of Fresh Fruit Records, a San Francisco-based company 
that markets albums by gay musicians and comedians, says he finds such humor in 
poor taste. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing for gay songwriters or comedians to poke fun at gay people in 
their art," Miller said. "That's like Woody Allen making fun of Jewish customs 
or Richard Pryor making light of black stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is simply not acceptable for someone who doesn't understand the culture 
to ridicule gays in their work." 
</P>
<P>
Gay activists not only criticize artists such as Kinison and Audio Two for 
recording what they perceive to be anti-gay diatribes, they also indict the 
record companies that finance and distribute such material. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, GLAAD's New York chapter launched a national letter-writing 
campaign directed at Atlantic Records, protesting the distribution of Audio 
Two's album. GLAAD's Los Angeles chairwoman Anderson says record companies are 
as much to blame as the artists. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Merlis, national publicity director at Warner Bros. Records, the company 
Kinison records for, said he views the debate over controversial subject matter 
as a First Amendment issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why a significant portion of people, whatever their sexual 
orientation, would find parts of Sam Kinison's humor offensive and demeaning," 
Merlis said. "But, by the same token, it would be hard to make the case that 
this guy, just because he espouses comedy that people find objectionable, ought 
to be stifled." 
</P>
<P>
Merlis portrays the record company's role as a commercial conduit between the 
artist and the public. If consumers find material objectionable, he says, they 
don't have to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
But Randy Morrison, the independent record producer who initiated the Kinison 
protest in 1988, insists that record companies do have an obligation to monitor 
potentially offensive product. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that Warner Bros. artists have done outstanding work with AIDS 
patients, but sometimes it seems like record labels who finance albums that 
include hateful messages are like the companies who made the poison gas during 
Nazi times," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Oh, we just put the gas out. We don't kill anybody.' . . . 
Sometimes it seems like all these guys care about is making a buck." 
</P>
<P>
Merlis disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to deny that we want to put out albums that sell," Merlis said. 
"But I take exception to anyone equating us with German munitions 
manufacturers. We make records and we know what they are used for. They are 
used for entertainment. It is our belief that record companies should not 
meddle in the creative process." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Records recently issued a press release that endorsed the 
constitutional right of artists to voice ideas with which the company 
"vehemently disagrees" and may find "personally repugnant." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Palmese, executive vice president and general manager of MCA Records, 
also believes in the right to artistic freedom, but qualified that right. 
</P>
<P>
"MCA Records supports the right of the artists to free expression," Palmese 
said. "I will, however, always do everything within my power to ensure that our 
artists act responsibly and do not traffic in any kind of bigotry or hatred." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ayeroff, president of Virgin Records, says that he would never put out any 
record that could be perceived as promoting bigotry. During his tenure at 
Warner Bros., Ayeroff refused to work on Kinison's record. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need to go to sleep at night thinking that I made my profits off the 
misery of any oppressed minority group," Ayeroff said in a recent telephone 
interview. "If somebody else can rest easy putting that kind of stuff out, let 
them. I'm just not going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ayeroff denied that such a stance constitutes censorship, insisting that record 
company executives exercise the right to determine what is recorded on their 
own labels. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of situation where as a businessman I have the right to make 
decisions on how I want to earn my living," Ayeroff said. "I'm not saying the 
group shouldn't put the album out. I just don't want any part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Why haven't gay activists been able to organize a more effective campaign 
against what they see as insensitive or anti-gay sentiments in the record 
business? 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons cited by various activists: the enormous amount of emotion 
and time required to deal with the AIDS epidemic, plus an age gap in the gay 
community. 
</P>
<P>
According to GLAAD's Anderson, the older gay generation, which is more 
politically involved than the younger gay generation, does not usually listen 
to rap or metal music. 
</P>
<P>
"So we don't actually hear about this kind of offensive material until long 
after it's been on the market," she said. "We have published articles in the 
gay press trying to raise the awareness of younger members regarding these 
issues, but I can't say that we have been terribly successful in reaching 
them." 
</P>
<P>
GLAAD believes that the best way for record companies to counter the negative 
impact of anti-gay material is to finance and promote positive public service 
announcements denouncing anti-gay bigotry. But, so far, GLAAD's attempts to 
enlist the support of labels like Geffen Records in such pursuits have proven 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Advocate columnist Block suggests that musicians and comics need to join the 
fight, denouncing the work of artists who promote anti-homosexual bigotry. 
Independent producer Morrison thinks gays working within the music business 
need to speak out more frequently regarding their opposition to anti-gay 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bell, editor and publisher of BLK magazine, said that the entire gay 
community needs to mobilize and let it be known that it won't tolerate 
offensive albums. 
</P>
<P>
"While my feelings may not represent the gay community as a whole, I personally 
believe that artists should not be prevented from recording this kind of 
stuff," Bell said. "The appropriate response is for gays to stop buying 
products from companies that promote hateful messages."

THE WILD COLONIAL BOY BY JAMES HYNES (ATHENEUM: $18.95; 356 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Coogan, renegade battalion commander of the Irish Republican Army, is the 
first person we meet in James Hynes' exciting and very well written first 
novel, a tightly-wound chronicle of the continuing troubles in contemporary 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Coogan, a 15-year veteran of guerrilla warfare, is a Provo leader without any 
men, following a shoot-out three months ago between his unit and a 
"suspiciously lucky" British patrol. Furious with the IRA chief of staff he 
thinks is about to sell out the movement by taking a seat in Parliament, Coogan 
is planning an unauthorized terrorist strike, "something spectacular" in 
England to spoil the chances of any politician's compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Driving alone past the flinty farms and open moorland north of Belfast, with 
ten pounds of Czech plastic explosives stuffed in an Adidas carryall, Jimmy 
Coogan is an outraged banner headline waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
But Coogan needs help. Sought by the Provos and shunned by the locals, his only 
ally is Maire Donovan, the Sinn Fein city councilor for West Belfast to whom he 
is secretly married. An outspoken public figure, Maire is in no position to 
participate in her husband's scheme to get the explosives into the sympathetic 
hands of the London Brigade. The wanted Coogan dare not try to carry the 
plastique into England himself. Where is the unknown innocent Coogan can use as 
an accomplice? 
</P>
<P>
Enter Brian Donovan, Maire's American cousin. Amiable, at loose ends, coasting 
on charm and good intentions, young Donovan has been deputized at the last 
moment to bring his dying grandfather's $10,000 from Detroit to Ulster and the 
Provos' pension fund. To Jimmy Coogan, Brian sounds the perfect choice to tote 
explosives past border guards. 
</P>
<P>
Maire is not so sure. "Americans are like children," she tells Coogan. "They 
come here like tourists to see a bit of aggro, get their thrill, and go home. 
It's like . . . Disneyland to them. Ulsterworld." When she encounters her 
cousin, he is even more unsuitable than she'd feared, seeming "less a foreigner 
than someone from another planet entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she arranges for Brian and Coogan to meet. Coogan sugarcoats his request 
with reassuring falsehoods. The apolitical American, following momentum and 
impulse, is drawn in. 
</P>
<P>
There are no real heroes in this taut thriller. Nearly everyone's actions are 
compromised by obsession, ambition or willful ignorance. Coogan is not averse 
to causing a bloody IRA schism to turn things the way he wants. Joe Brody, the 
seeming moderate Coogan is opposed to, shops his enemies to "trigger-happy" 
British troops. 
</P>
<P>
Maire Donovan is caught between her husband's plotting and her own better 
judgment, and the incriminating Polaroid she takes of her cousin to insure his 
loyalty eventually causes all kinds of grief. Brian's fumbling efforts to do 
the right thing are spoiled by his failure to confront hard realities; his 
less-than-complete honesty with Clare, a sweet and even more innocent American 
abroad, leads them both to the edge of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Brian at least means well. Much more distasteful are the ethical twists and 
turns made by Tim McGuire, the obese free-lance journalist Coogan bullies into 
assisting him. "Here he had the story of a lifetime," McGuire reflects after 
Coogan lets him in on his discontent, "and he couldn't print it. . . . He 
believed in the Republican movement . . . and if he printed what Jimmy Coogan 
had just told him, he'd be siding with those who wanted to bring it down . . . 
" Besides, McGuire asks himself, what if Coogan fails and Brody wins? "Then I'd 
be out in the cold forever, he thought, reviled as Jimmy Coogan's publicist, 
the end of my career in the North . . . " Better all the way around to betray 
Coogan, McGuire decides. 
</P>
<P>
If Hynes offers no unequivocal good guys, what he does deliver is a terrific 
read, filled with believable and memorable characters who are as dimensional 
and full of surprises as the folks you meet in real life. They charm, they 
startle, and often they make you laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The tension that builds throughout the book is leavened by wry humor, with 
Maire seeming to have the best lines. (She also gets perhaps the most powerful 
scene in the novel, an unexpected and flesh-chilling Gaelic wail of grief.) 
</P>
<P>
With this impressive debut, novelist Hynes stakes a fair claim to part of that 
morally complex modern political terrain mapped out by the likes of Graham 
Greene, Joseph Conrad and Robert Stone. His characters meet fates that seem 
appropriate and even inevitable, while the larger issues remain realistically 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
A brief exchange occuring halfway through the book seems emblematic of a 
struggle that seems to know no end. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we winning, Joe?" an old Belfast Brigade vet asks Joe Brody. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Brody answers, "but we're not losing either." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, aye," the old man concludes, "that'll have to do for now."

NIGHT LIFE: UNITED NATIONS HIP-HOPS WITH RACIAL HARMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's somewhere around 1 a.m. somewhere on the eastern fringe of Hollywood, and 
somebody on a tiny stage in a big hall steps up to a microphone and bellows: 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody, everybody, anybody . . . screammmmm." 
</P>
<P>
He tells the crowd to throw their hands in the air and to wave them as if they 
just don't care. He asks the ladies in the house to say "owwwww." And many of 
them do. 
</P>
<P>
By now, most everyone realizes that the people with the man on stage are 
members of the progressive hip-hop posse Boogie Down Productions -- guests on 
"The Arsenio Hall Show" just a few hours earlier -- making a surprise 
appearance at this club. 
</P>
<P>
The club deejay at the side of the stage gestures wildly, the beat from Audio 
Two's rap hit "Top Billing" thuds from the massive speakers, and the man with 
the microphone begins to rap, first haltingly and then more fluently, until a 
woman rapper seizes the mike and embellishes the beat with her melodic island 
lilt. 
</P>
<P>
Boogie Down's KRS-One takes over, rapping in a quick, reggae-toaster style, 
lashing out in raw, spontaneous rhyme against racism and the bullies of the 
Bush Administration, darting in and out of and enlivening the monotonous, 
bass-heavy beat. 
</P>
<P>
He works the crowd, prodding it, flirting, building to a delighted roar. 
KRS-One's never been much live -- he depends on the audience to know every word 
-- but he's electric here. As suddenly as the rapping started, it ends, a mere 
10 minutes later. And half the house keeps on dancing, oblivious to anything 
but the beat. 
</P>
<P>
MTV and Rolling Stone look for the Summer of Love in every Parisian soca joint 
and Ecstasy-soaked Manchester disco, but the real thing might be going down 
every Tuesday night in an aging L.A. ballroom: an ongoing festival of peace, 
love and understanding that vibrates to the sound of rap music, a crossroads of 
Afro-centric youth culture that just happens to work as a wildly popular dance 
club. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations is the cultural arm of the Zulu Nation, a loose, international 
collective of musicians, organizers and graffiti artists that dates back to the 
earliest days of rap. (Any time you see an artist wearing an Afrika medallion 
in a video or on stage -- Public Enemy, Kool Moe Dee, Ice-T, De La Soul, even 
Milli Vanilli and Bobby Brown -- he or she is probably down with the Zulus.) 
</P>
<P>
The club is a utopian fantasy of a '90s hip-hop discotheque, 1,500 young people 
of every conceivable ethnic group bobbing mostly drug-free until 3 a.m., 
brightly colored peace signs and tie-dyes and Afrika medallions everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of groovy racial harmony rarely seen outside a Soul II Soul 
video: black and white and Asian and Latino slamming side-by-side to the beat. 
If you could set the Rainbow Coalition to music it would look something like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"Hip-hop is a true culture, and we present it as honestly as we can. . . . The 
music, the dance, the African fashion, the graffiti art," says Zulu Nation 
leader Afrika Islam. "The kind of freestyle dancing you see in videos and at 
the club dates back to Africa -- it's a genuine part of our culture. Even break 
dancing is coming back, because the music is intense and United Nations is a 
place to do it among peers." 
</P>
<P>
Islam, United Nations' star deejay and the man who creates the beats for 
Ice-T's records, has been involved in hip-hop since at least the mid-'70s, 
first as the right hand to hip-hop innovator Afrika ("Planet Rock") Bambaataa 
in the South Bronx, then in the Rock Steady Zulu Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Brought to California by Ice-T about 10 years ago, he has spun at many of the 
best L.A. dance clubs -- including Radio, near MacArthur Park, the first local 
rap club -- and he brought out, in turn, several of the early Bronx rappers to 
work with Ice-T's Rhyme Syndicate and with the club. Old-school Bronx hip-hop 
makes its home in Hollywood these days. 
</P>
<P>
The core Zulu audience coalesced near the end of the '80s at Water the Bush, a 
rap-oriented dance club at Hollywood Live, a hall across the street from Mann's 
Chinese Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
After that club closed late last year, United Nations opened its doors at the 
Stardust Ballroom, on Sunset just west of Western. 
</P>
<P>
In L.A., dance clubs move around a lot -- some people think a new location 
renews a club's energy. Since Boogie Down Productions' impromptu performance at 
the Stardust, United Nations has moved twice. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of weeks back at Hollywood Live, it's now ensconced in the 
cavernous, 1,500-capacity dance hall called the Casa, south of downtown at the 
corner of Washington and Oak. Whatever the location, the spirit remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Branches are scheduled to open in Tokyo in October and in London next January. 
Zulu Nation members work the door, make the art, furnish the music, provide 
security. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations partner Fareed estimates there are 100 Nation members in L.A., 
but maybe 5,000 "affiliates." What is an affiliate? 
</P>
<P>
"Someone who will come to the club and buy a T-shirt and dance." 
</P>
<P>
Over the dance floor swing black lights and disco balls, red-glowing globes and 
fluorescent ankhs, peace signs, Africa-shaped cutouts, Islamic stars and 
crescent moons and Zulu-type masks; the flags of all nations hang in an arc. 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the room, Bruce Lee and Ice-T videos play, without sound, on a 
screen. At the other is a deserted bar. . . . People here mostly don't drink. 
In a corner, a photographer takes a picture of three blondes against a 
wild-style graffiti mural. 
</P>
<P>
A percentage of the club's profits goes to Justiceville, Ted Hayes' coalition 
for the homeless; Earth Day and Malcolm X's birthday are celebrated in a big 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The songs blasting are mostly familiar to any "Yo! MTV Raps" listener -- Tone 
Loc, Heavy D, Big Daddy Kane, Queen Latifah -- and flow seamlessly, often for 
only a minute or two each. The original cowbell version of LL Cool J's "Rock 
the Bells" slides into Eric B.'s "I Know You Got Soul" so smoothly that it's 
impossible to decide where one record ends and the other begins. 
</P>
<P>
Two records play at once more often than you would think, one beat reinforcing 
the other; the scratching is usually slick enough to have been part of the mix 
to begin with. At least half the music is rap "oldies." Time hasn't made 
Run-DMC's "Rock Box" any easier to dance to, but people try. 
</P>
<P>
In an incense-scented room off the entrance, a few dozen slower-moving people 
skank methodically to reggae and the funkier types of world music -- island 
versions of the "Ghostbusters" theme -- under a dim, black-light glow. 
Somewhere else, vendors sell African beads, dashikis and all manner of bootleg 
Bart Simpson shirts, also tithing to Justiceville. 
</P>
<P>
The club's flyers, thrust on you at rap shows and underground clubs, specify 
Zulu attire. What constitutes Zulu attire? Well, anything really: tight body 
shirts and biker shorts, if you can get away with them, polka dots or bold 
stripes, berets, Egyptian toques, clean college sweat shirts, big hoop 
earrings, overalls with one strap hanging off the shoulder, or a tight dress. 
"Anything but jeans and T-shirts, really," Islam said. "A peaceful attitude 
extends to peaceful attire." 
</P>
<P>
United Nations -- whatever its location -- is the place to wear that special 
saffron-and-scarlet Nefertiti gown. If you're a rapper yourself, or know one, 
you might wear a black cap with your crew name or a sports emblem on it; if 
you're a Japanese tourist, you'll wear many yards of West African kinte cloth, 
maybe a blouse-like dashiki with wildly contrasting bloomers, because that's 
what it says to do in the magazines. Leather Afrika medallions, Rastabart 
shirts and anything red, black and green. 
</P>
<P>
Late most nights, Islam takes over the turntables, and he layers bits of songs, 
speeding some up, kicking a short phrase from turntable to turntable so the 
groove seems to last forever. When you're dancing, you may not notice Big Daddy 
Kane asking, "Won't you be my beefaroni" until the sixth or seventh repetition. 
</P>
<P>
"Whassup," says a young black man to the big Samoan with ceremonial braids. The 
young man adjusts his L.A. Kings cap, then sweeps across the club, people 
nodding in recognition, and disappears into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Later he pops up in a corner of the room, doing a credible imitation of someone 
who has stuck his finger into an electric socket, jerking to a Cool Rob G tune, 
and a circle forms around him. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour or so, when the break dancers are exhausted and the hangers-on 
are bored, a skinny kid jumps into the circle, falls face first, catching 
himself at ground level, and launches into a complicated whirl, flipping and 
vaulting and tucking his legs in a spectacular display. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged, a couple of dancers rush him, and boom, Zulu security hustles them out 
the back door in seconds, before anyone realizes what's happened. Even in a 
club dedicated to peace and unity, the real world sometimes intrudes.

KINISON TAKES A SECOND LOOK AT HIS AIDS AND GAY HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Kinison, whose shock-rock humor seems to have enraged gay and lesbian 
activists more than any other popular artist, says his comedy is misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
Kinison's battle with the gay community began after he recorded some jokes 
about AIDS on his 1988 Warner Bros. album "Have You Seen Me Lately?" The jokes 
in question made light of the AIDS epidemic, depicting gays engaging in 
bestiality and necrophilia. 
</P>
<P>
The backlash from the gay community was intense. Six gay, lesbian and AIDS 
activist coalitions protested the release of the album and pressured Kinison's 
record company to put two warning labels on the album jacket and to include an 
AIDS awareness pamphlet with the record. 
</P>
<P>
Fallout from this episode resurfaced last month after Elton John's comments on 
the "International Rock Awards" broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to John's remarks, Kinison said: 
</P>
<P>
"What Elton John said about me was way out of line. He never did his homework 
and he owes me an apology. Just because I do a few comedy bits about gay 
people, that does not mean I'm out there promoting some anti-gay cause. I'm a 
comedian and my comedy has never endorsed violence towards gays." 
</P>
<P>
Kinison, whose albums also include stinging barbs about drug addicts, God, 
alcoholics, rock stars, the elderly and the starving, defends his irreverent 
approach to humor. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1990s, it's OK to do comedy about the Chernobyl disaster or the Space 
Shuttle blowing up," Kinison said in a telephone interview. "It's acceptable to 
ridicule the Pope or the President of the United States, but God forbid you do 
a joke . . . about gays. The gay community is the last sacred cow in this 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the controversy surrounding his AIDS jokes, Kinison now feels he 
showed poor judgment. 
</P>
<P>
After the death of young AIDS victim Ryan White and learning that his best 
friend's father contracted AIDS last year, Kinison says he now considers the 
AIDS epidemic too tragic to make light of. 
</P>
<P>
Kinison has helped raise more than $500,000 to fight the disease by donating 
his services to the T.J. Martell Foundation, a Los Angeles-based organization 
that funds cancer and leukemia research. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do jokes about AIDS or death anymore," Kinison said. "Now I realize 
that I was pretty insensitive about AIDS, but back then I was honestly unaware. 
AIDS is a horrible disease and the people who catch it deserve compassion."

SCULPTOR TAKES HIMSELF OUT OF PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
CHARLES RAY COMES UP WITH NEW FORMS -- NOT HIS OWN -- IN DEPARTURE FROM 
CONFRONTATIONAL BODY SCULPTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Ray has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the 37-year-old artist was regularly seen among the sculptural materials 
employed in his art. His naked body would lay perfectly still inside a 
horizontal steel box attached to the wall, with one arm dangling through a 
cutout hole to literally create a sculptural appendage, the other arm resting 
on the bump of a bony hip that peeked above the box. 
</P>
<P>
Or else he would stand, again naked, with his head in a lineup of ordinary 
objects placed on a high shelf: vase next to box next to gasoline can next to 
human head. 
</P>
<P>
Or, simpler still, Ray would pin himself against the wall with a plank, the 
dead weight of his torso pressed between the two, conspiring with gravity to 
suspend his body several feet off the floor. In these precocious student works, 
his body became a human painting hanging on a gallery wall. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation of flesh and blood into the form of sculpture, domestic 
container and painting came to an end about five years ago, as Ray began to 
disentangle his body from his art. A principal interest of these body-related 
works had been the peculiar, if frequently unexamined, relationship between a 
work of art and the spectator who encounters it. Simply by making the spectator 
aware that, as a viewer, he was not the only living, breathing half of the 
liaison, Ray clearly meant to disorient that common relationship. Made quietly 
unnerving, the spectator's discourse with art would be refreshed and vivified. 
</P>
<P>
At least, it would be vivified in principal. In practice, that eye-opening 
refreshment did not quite work out. Ray's body sculptures had developed out of 
a larger artistic 
</P>
<P>
shift. His hybrid form brought together aspects of performance art and Minimal 
sculpture -- two modes that had emerged in the 1960s in an effort to 
acknowledge and explore the complex social space in which art and meaning take 
shape. But, for me, encounters with Ray's body sculptures were marred by their 
decidedly demonstrative nature; they had a nagging aura of show-and-tell. 
</P>
<P>
As with the operatic installation art of Ann Hamilton, which also employs 
costumed actors as silently posed perfomers in elaborate tableaux, a 
conspiratorial quality of "let's pretend" defused the necessary tension of 
Ray's art. Certainly it was startling to come upon a naked person embedded in a 
sculpture. Yet, in order to convincingly stage the performance-sculpture, the 
mute artist/performer was required to ignore the spectator -- to simply pretend 
you were not there. 
</P>
<P>
For an aesthetic determined to dig deep into a spectator's equivocal experience 
of art, this was a rather ironic handicap. The body-to-body confrontation 
central to Ray's endeavor was safely intellectualized, out of physical harm's 
way. Your surrender to the situation was demanded. 
</P>
<P>
A key ingredient in Ray's evolving solution to the dilemma has been to sidle 
off center stage, as his often compelling work of the last several years 
attests. Now, he lurks impishly in the wings. Ray began to make sculptures in 
which the essential pivot is often a perceived absence of the body. Typically, 
the spectator's presence fills in for the artist's. At its best, Ray's art 
becomes a vivid point of contact between the artist's outstretched hand and 
yours. His sculpture could be described metaphorically, as attempting to 
harness that electrically charged space between the index fingers of God and 
Adam in a certain Sistine ceiling fresco. 
</P>
<P>
A good chunk of Ray's work from the past five years may be seen in Newport 
Beach and Los Angeles. Nine sculptures dating from 1986 through 1989 are on 
view, through Sept. 23, at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, including his great 
breakthrough piece, "Ink Box." And five more recent works, all but one made 
this year, are presently at Burnett Miller Gallery, where the Los Angeles-based 
artist has lately been represented, to Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor exhibition is the artist's first significant show at a 
museum -- a single exceptional piece was included in last year's biennial 
exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art -- yet, it's somewhat 
disappointing. The show feels lackadaisical. Several individual works are 
strong, and a few have not been seen here before; still, the selection as a 
whole seems decidedly haphazard. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the concurrent exhibitions suggest several emergent themes in Ray's 
sculpture; at the museum, however, it's hard to discern any curatorial point of 
view at work, save for an apparent desire to offer a general sampler of the 
artist's increasingly important oeuvre. Nor is there a catalogue or brochure, 
nor even a didactic label on the wall (according to a museum spokesman, a 
planned brochure has been delayed). The show, which will not travel, feels more 
like a commercial gallery presentation than a rigorous museum exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's art frequently looks simple, but in fact it is often very difficult to 
install and maintain. (For proof, try filling an old-fashioned porcelain 
bathtub with water, then mounting it -- vertically, not horizontally -- on a 
wall. Ray's water-filled "Bath," from 1989, floats impossibly in the space of 
the museum wall, as if seen from an aerial vantage point.) At least three of 
the nine works at Newport required heroic measures to accommodate. You have the 
sense that the complications of installation were all the museum could handle. 
</P>
<P>
Still, coupled with the actual gallery presentation at Burnett Miller, the 
perspicacious (and peripatetic) visitor will find numerous rewards. Together, 
the shows make plain that a lexicon of forms has begun to emerge in Ray's 
mature work, forms whose ancestry in his early body sculptures is clear. The 
shelf, or table-top, is a recurrent motif, as are the rotating disk and the 
mannequin (a surrogate human body). And the box, or other type of container, is 
perhaps pre-eminent. 
</P>
<P>
Space, a sculptor's principal medium, is keenly deployed within this range of 
forms, several of which can coexist in a single piece. "Table" (1990) is most 
eloquent in this regard. A simple table of steel, topped by a clear sheet of 
plexiglass, is arrayed with a variety of containers -- pitcher, bowl, drinking 
glasses, carafe, covered jar -- also formed of transparent plastic. In each 
case, the plane of contact between container and table-top has been cut out; if 
you put anything in the bowl, for example, it would go through to the floor. 
Intangible space seems to flow disconcertingly through the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The jar provides a subtle but important counterpoint to that flow, its cover 
rudely putting a lid on the action. Thus are the fluid properties of space made 
strangely visible, while emptiness is given energetic life. 
</P>
<P>
Two earlier table sculptures also play with perceptual incongruities. One 
transforms a still life into a group of individual objects, each slowly 
rotating at an almost imperceptible speed; the other connects its assorted 
still-life elements by way of a network of tubes crisscrossing beneath the 
table's surface. (A fourth table, not in either show, removes the surface of 
the table altogether; each still-life element is suspended by a supporting rod, 
together identifying a plane of empty space.) Vaguely diabolical in bearing, 
these disparate sculptures show how Ray returns to a simple motif to mine it in 
a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
More important, there is something poignant and solitary about the table 
sculptures. The technical complexity of Ray's art is such that you tend to 
scrutinize the work in an effort to understand how it was made and, by 
extension, through what processes the idea might have originated. The table 
sculptures conjure someone sitting alone at a kitchen table -- "contemplating 
the salt shaker," as it were, or thinking about the nature of things. The 
artist, in absentia, is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
He also turns up as a costumed department store mannequin in a recent 
self-portrait sculpture, as well as in an installation in which a framed, 
photographic self-portrait is curved to fit the swelling, curved wall on which 
it incongruously hangs. The curved wall, irrationally bowed out into the room, 
seems to be responding to enormous hidden pressures; riding the crest of the 
wave, the artist's image is carried along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's mannequin is very funny, in part because such things are supposed to be 
generic, not specific, and in part because artists' self-portraits typically 
tend toward the cerebral or emotionally refined, not toward assertions of 
cultural status as a commercial dummy. "That's not really me," this rudimentary 
self-portrait declares, its unexpected candor running contrary to the very 
genre of portraiture. 
</P>
<P>
A slightly earlier manifestation of the department store mannequin motif is 
also on view. This undressed, anatomically incorrect mannequin has been 
pointedly "corrected" by the artist. At first, the hyper-realistic genitals on 
the otherwise schematic dummy are startling; soon, it is the hyper-phoniness of 
the idealized dummy itself, with its typical department store style, that seems 
truly odd. Ray's addition to this bizarre creature, which was initially 
designed to be a surrogate for you and me, unearths an implied duet between 
idealization and taboo. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the obvious tour de force at Burnett Miller Gallery is a wonderful 
mechanized carousel titled "Revolution Counter-Revolution." The base of a 
child-size merry-go-round rotates clockwise, at a fairly good clip. Four pairs 
of suspended ponies and two swings, all empty and awaiting riders, also rotate, 
but in the opposite direction. Ray has calibrated the speed ratio of these two 
conflicting rotations so the riderless steeds appear nearly stationary, 
suspended in space as the ground plane rushes away. Almost imperceptibly, the 
horses inch forward, as if against an unseen but overwhelming inertia. 
</P>
<P>
More quietly, if nonetheless technically surprising, "7 1/2 Ton Cube" (1990) is 
a pure white, pristine, perfectly milled block of solid steel. Its elegant, 
immovable bulk stands as wild counterpoint to Ray's most accomplished 
sculpture, the pivotal "Ink Box" (1986). A hollow, open cube of black-lacquered 
steel, also three feet to a side, "Ink Box" is filled to the brim with some 200 
gallons of jet-black printer's ink. The quivering meniscus of ink that is the 
top plane of this menacing black cube forms a threatening surface just begging 
to be touched, even in the face of certain disaster. Avant le deluge, the 
hair-raising conflict between a desire to act and a denial of experience is 
tightly focused. 
</P>
<P>
In the evocation of disarming conflicts such as this, Ray's art finds its most 
profound resonance. At his best, he is able to locate these complex perceptions 
deep in the bodily consciousness of the spectator. The High Modernist 
conception of the work of art as an all-knowing, all-seeing eye, disembodied 
and disengaged from the passive viewer but held aloft as his moral guide, is 
laboriously pulled back down to Earth. Charles Ray gives his art weight and 
dramatic space -- and he acknowledges the same prerogatives for its spectators.

HOW TO TRAIN A BABY GOURMET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I took our son Lucas out for his first fancy French dinner the 
other night. 
</P>
<P>
He especially liked the diced, marinated Norwegian salmon served on a thin 
slice of raw potato and topped with caviar. But he was also enthusiastic about 
andouillette de la mer (seafood sausage) gobbled up some potato risotto, had a 
bite or two of chicken in a shallot and vinegar sauce and seemed positively 
transported by his first taste of creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure just which dish Lucas liked best, though, because he couldn't 
quite articulate his preferences. 
</P>
<P>
He's only 9 months old. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't even walk -- which might have been a blessing. He spent 90 minutes 
sitting in his chair -- one of those gadgets that clips on to the side of the 
table -- happily eating whatever the chef put in front of him. Then, when he 
appeared to grow bored (or tired), we took him out of the chair and let him 
"cruise" around the safely locked wine display case across from our table while 
I walked alongside, as guide (for him) and protector (for the other diners). 
</P>
<P>
Some friends think we were crazy to take so young a child to a nice restaurant. 
Maybe. Lucas didn't seem to think so. 
</P>
<P>
We chose the restaurant carefully. We picked Citrus because we think it has the 
best food in town and because, unlike many French restaurants, it's very 
casual. If Lucas happened to drop his silverware on the floor, dribble his 
orange juice on the tablecloth or squeal aloud a time or two -- all of which he 
did within 10 minutes of our arrival -- we knew the waiters wouldn't be 
scandalized. More important, we knew that chef/owner Michel Richard would be 
pleased that we had chosen his restaurant for Lucas' gastronomic debut. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Michel beamed throughout, checked on Lucas' progress after every 
course and made two dishes especially for him -- the potato risotto and the 
diced salmon (we also had the salmon but since we have teeth, ours was sliced, 
not diced). 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't actually Lucas' first visit to a fine restaurant. He's been to 
Patina, to Pazzia and to Primi. He was younger then, and slept through the 
meals. But more recently we took him for Saturday lunch at Fennel, as a 
(successful) test run for Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lucas was born, Lucy and I ate out four or five nights a week. We've 
continued to eat out two or three nights a week, but at home we first put Lucas 
in a Sassy seat on the floor between us; later, we put him in a high chair. At 
six months we fed him chopped, ground and mashed versions of whatever we were 
eating. He got used to eating with us, to eating off a plate and from a fork, 
and to drinking from a glass -- however sloppily and uncertainly -- and he 
developed an early preference for real food. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas usually starts a meal with formula or a jar of baby food, but the instant 
we begin to eat, he loses all interest in what he has and wants what we're 
eating -- swordfish, tuna, chicken, pasta, broccoli, lentils, beets, French 
bread, a fresh peach, watermelon, whatever. A few weeks ago he even managed to 
gum several bites of pastrami into submission at the Stage Deli. 
</P>
<P>
So I wasn't terribly worried about taking Lucas to a nice restaurant; he eats 
well wherever he is, and he's very well-behaved. I figured that if he did make 
a fuss at Citrus, we'd just apologize, pay our check and make a quick exit. 
</P>
<P>
But we spent two and a half hours in the restaurant, and while he did drop, 
spill and knock over several things and he did squeal and yelp from time to 
time, he didn't cry or scream or break anything or bother anyone (except maybe 
the people who had to clean the tablecloth and the floor beneath his seat). 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was so good that a few days after Citrus, we took him to a local Indian 
restaurant. He had Tandoori chicken and garlic nan -- and in the week after 
that he happily sampled some takeout Sichuan eggplant and returned to both 
Primi and Pazzia with much pleasure -- and without incident. (Judging from the 
way he was waving his arms and banging his spoon and screeching with pleasure, 
the pappa al pomodoro at Pazzia is his favorite Italian dish. So far.) 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm eager to take him to France, for my annual pilgrimage to three-star 
restaurants. I wonder if he'll be content drinking his usual white (Chateau 
Similac) with his filet au bar . . . or if he'll insist on Chateau-Grillet.

PROTEST OVER RACISM IN OCEAN BEACH SHOOTING DRAWS 200 TO RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a suspected race-related shooting Monday, more than 200 people 
gathered at a street corner in Ocean Beach Saturday to protest what they say is 
resurgent racism in the beachfront community. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on top of milk crates, community leaders, residents, and some who say 
they have been the victims of recent racial threats and violence in Ocean Beach 
spoke to the crowd, while six police officers stood by. 
</P>
<P>
In the only disturbances of the rally, the crowd, mainly composed of whites and 
about 50 blacks, unanimously shouted down two people disrupting the rally, 
which lasted about 75 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gormlie, the organizer, called the protest after the shooting of Philip 
Lewis, a 26-year-old black man. Gormlie said the shooting has elicited a strong 
reaction in Ocean Beach and that residents point to it as an example of racist 
acts in the community. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lewis, four white men in a pickup truck called him a "nigger" 
after he left a friend's home at the corner of Abbott Street and Brighton 
Avenue shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The men jumped out of the truck and chased him with tire irons, he said, while 
he picked up a 2 by 4 and jumped for cover behind boxes in an alley. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting for 10 minutes, he said, he left the alley but was shot in the 
lower back and left arm when he appeared on Voltaire Street. 
</P>
<P>
"They were waiting for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's rally, held a short distance from where the shooting occurred in 
a parking lot at the corner of Voltaire Street and Cable Street, Lewis, 
released from UC San Diego Medical Center, was cheered as he spoke about the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who these people are, but I'm willing to forgive them," said 
Lewis, his arm wrapped in a thick bandage. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish they would go to hell or go to jail," said Lewis, a three-year 
resident of Ocean Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Meredith, the friend Lewis visited on the night of the shooting, said 
Monday's act is just the latest in a string of increasing racial threats and 
attacks he's seen in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Every two or three days someone drives by flipping us off and telling us to 
leave," said Meredith, 20. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fran and Herb Meredith, his father, two or three acts of racism 
are directed at them every week. 
</P>
<P>
They range from people driving by and yelling racial pejoratives to tire 
slashings and the Monday attack, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some question whether they are really racially motivated," said Herb, 54, who 
manages an apartment complex at the corner of Abbott Street and Brighton 
Avenue. "But I have no doubt they were racially motivated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Herb said everyone he has seen threatening his family or other blacks has been 
under 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
About two months ago, a knife-carrying white male was arrested at Meredith's 
apartment complex, said Peter Gaughen, San Diego Police Department community 
relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
Fran, who was there at the time, said the man was yelling "kill niggers." 
</P>
<P>
Gaughen said two new witnesses to the Monday shooting came forward this week, 
corroborating what Lewis said about the attack. He also said they have a 
description of the vehicle driven in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Gormlie, who has lived in the community for 20 years, said many of the several 
hundred flyers posted to draw people to the rally were ripped down earlier in 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the 19th Century, though evidently there are some people still 
with that mentality," he said.

U.S., SOVIETS PROBING SEXUAL ATTACK CHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: THE INCIDENT ALLEGEDLY OCCURED WHEN THE FEMALE U.S. NAVY PETTY 
OFFICER WAS TOURING A SOVIET DESTROYER. 
</P>

As three Soviet naval vessels steam for home, both the U.S. and Soviet Union 
are investigating allegations that a female U.S. Navy petty officer was 
sexually assaulted on one of the ships about 8 p.m. Tuesday, just hours after 
the ships arrived at San Diego Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
"(Friday) morning we learned that allegations were made by a female petty 
officer who said she had been sexually assaulted on board one of the Soviet 
ships while they were in port," Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a U.S. Navy spokesman, said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Schamp would not specify if the woman said she was raped. 
</P>
<P>
The three ships left San Diego this morning after a five-day stay in the United 
States, the third in a series of reciprocal visits between the navies. 
</P>
<P>
"As of this morning, the young woman couldn't come up with any kind of 
identification (of an assailant)," Schamp said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that came out of her statement was turned over to the Soviet Navy 
prior to the time they departed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident allegedly occurred when the woman, who was not in uniform, was 
separated from friends aboard one of the two Soviet destroyers that were being 
toured by the public, the Boyevoy and Admiral Vinogradov. 
</P>
<P>
The primary jurisdiction of any offense that occurred on a Soviet ship would be 
the Soviet Navy's, said Capt. Roger Smith of the Judge Advocate General Corps. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who said he has not been involved in the investigation, said, "(The 
ship) is an extension of their sovereignity." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel Jerry Harke, a Pentagon spokesman, said he did not know if the 
Department of Defense was investigating, but that several federal agencies 
were. 
</P>
<P>
"They are working to provide information to the Soviets and are asking the 
Soviets to help in ensuring that justice is served," Harke said. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Stovall, the Naval Investigative Service special-agent-in-charge of the 
San Diego Naval Station, would only say that his agency is investigating the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Stovall would not give any details about the case or about its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Saturday morning before the ships left for their home 
port of Vladivostok, Adm. Charles Larson, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, 
said both countries were investigating the case, but he would not give details. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the Soviets and ourselves share a common concern over any such 
allegations," said Larson, the official host of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We will move swiftly to determine the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Schamp said he discussed the matter with Soviet officials, who said there was 
"extremely stringent security" on the ships Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it would have been impossible for an incident to have taken place on 
their ship," Schamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Colonel Nicholay N. Bessubchenco, of the Soviet Political Directorate, said 
Friday that if the Soviet Navy determined there was evidence to prosecute a 
sailor, it would be done "very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
According to Schamp, the jurisdiction of the case is "very complex." 
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be settled at two or three levels -- the state department, 
the military, and locally," Schamp said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will probably be a wrap-up of our evaluation and everything we are able 
to gather will be forwarded to the Soviet Navy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Consulate in San Francisco did not return phone calls Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The two destroyers and an oiler, the Argun, arrived Tuesday morning after an 
18-day trip across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Their visit follows a Soviet Naval visit to Norfolk, Va., in July 1989, and a 
U.S. Navy call on the Black Sea port of Sevastopol last August. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, ships from the U.S. Pacific Fleet will voyage to Vladivostok, the 
chief Pacific port of the Soviet Union.

THEFT: STEALING CONSTRUCTION SITE MATERIALS IN ANTELOPE VALLEY HAS BECOME A 
BRAZEN CRIME THAT INCREASES BUILDING COSTS. THE LOOT INCLUDES BULLDOZERS, 
HOUSEHOLD FIXTURES, TREES, EVEN LANDSCAPING DIRT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Antelope Valley builders talk with disgust about a construction site crime wave 
that has accompanied a recent housing boom -- and with amazement at the sheer 
industriousness of thieves who pillage unfinished houses like locusts. 
</P>
<P>
"They take cabinets, plumbing fixtures," said Andrew Eliopulos, vice president 
of J.P. Eliopulos Enterprises Inc. in Lancaster. "They take lumber, doors, 
windows, sinks, toilets, tools. When we pour our foundations, we've actually 
had guys who came out to chisel the concrete and hacksaw out the copper 
fixtures." 
</P>
<P>
The loot taken from construction sites also includes bulldozers, trees, 
expensive laser leveling devices and dirt for landscaping. During a burglary 
spree early this year, two Palmdale men with cocaine habits and a pickup truck 
stole more than $5,000 worth of dishwashers and stoves from at least eight 
developments before being caught, according to court documents. Like many other 
thieves, they struck in broad daylight at busy work sites. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases the construction activity was so intense that people would drive 
in and pick up stuff and no one would question them," said Rick Norris, 
executive director of the Antelope Valley Building Industry Assn. He said there 
are currently 109 tracts under construction in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in brazen thefts peaked last year when the value of building permits 
hit an Antelope Valley record of $1.4 billion. Housing starts in the area have 
dropped 30% this year and sales are off as well. 
</P>
<P>
Thefts are also down, according to law enforcement officials and builders, but 
theft, vandalism and arson remain worrisome in the high-desert building 
industry. A new concern is that with the slump in the market, houses may remain 
empty and unsold for longer periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
"Construction is slowing down; they are definitely sitting longer," said 
Lancaster Building and Safety Director Fred Norton. 
</P>
<P>
Theft is a perennial problem at construction sites everywhere, Norton and 
others said. But it has been particularly noticeable in the Antelope Valley 
because of the speed and volume of building activity there and the vastness of 
the area, which makes it hard to police. 
</P>
<P>
Professional thieves aren't the only culprits. One prominent builder, who asked 
not to be identified, estimated that more than half of all construction theft 
in the Antelope Valley can be attributed to construction workers. Estimates by 
sheriff's officials were less specific, but they agreed that many thefts are 
inside jobs carried out by an often transient work force. 
</P>
<P>
Temptation draws opportunistic outsiders as well, such as the driver of a car 
filled with freshly stolen roofing materials and lumber who Eliopulos spotted 
one night last year in one of his Lancaster housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
Eliopulos gave chase and called the Sheriff's Department on his mobile phone. 
Half a dozen patrol cars took part in a high-speed freeway pursuit that ended 
when deputies forced the car to a stop and dragged out the driver at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The accused thief turned out to be a man who had recently bought a house in 
Palmdale and he told police he stole the materials to build an addition. When 
asked why he didn't go to a more conventional source such as Costco or the Home 
Club, stores whose credit cards were in his wallet, Eliopulos said the suspect 
replied: "They didn't have what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Though they say it is hard to prove, builders and city officials suspect the 
same cavalier attitude exists among many residents of incomplete housing 
tracts. Thefts of materials from residences under construction in a development 
are accompanied by sudden flurries of home improvement with the same kind of 
materials at the occupied houses, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you supposed to do?" Eliopulos said. "You can't put your name on 
every piece of lumber on the site." 
</P>
<P>
Building industry representatives said the thefts translate into higher 
insurance rates and house prices. Eliopulos estimated that crime costs the 
consumer about $500 extra per dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
"It drives up the costs," Norris said. "It does get passed on." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies make a special effort to patrol construction sites, said 
Capt. Gary Vance of the Antelope Valley sheriff's station. Many large 
development companies also employ private security guards. 
</P>
<P>
"We have full-time security from dusk to dawn," said Stewart Green, president 
of the local Building Industry Assn. and of Pacifica Corp., which spent more 
than $50 million on Antelope Valley projects last year. "Our firm has been 
quite lucky. I am not aware of major thefts of appliances or lumber." 
</P>
<P>
But Green and others conceded that there is a limit to what can be done, given 
the size and remoteness of many sites and the fact that some thieves operate 
during the workday. For example, the Mirabella Villas condominium development 
in Lancaster employs security guards, yet on June 16 it was the site of the 
largest arson in Antelope Valley history, a $6-million blaze that damaged or 
destroyed 80 condominiums on a Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
A disgruntled roofing foreman has been charged with setting that blaze and is 
awaiting trial. He allegedly told acquaintances that he set the fire because he 
was angry over a pay dispute that arose when a subcontractor left town without 
paying roofers their wages. Such disputes are frequent in the industry and are 
often the motivation for arson or thefts, according to one sheriff's burglary 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
Arson and accidental fires are a particular concern because the area's hot, 
dry, windy climate can transform the rows of wood structures and piles of 
building materials on construction sites into infernos. County fire inspectors 
intensified their scrutiny of work sites last year after determining that 
several fires resulted from unsafe soldering practices by workers under 
pressure to finish houses quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Security issues multiply when the boom goes bust and cities, law enforcement 
agencies and residents find themselves having to contend with instant blight. 
</P>
<P>
Two housing tracts in Lancaster provide examples. The Legends and Silverado 
tracts were begun in 1987 by the U.S. Housing Corp. of Burbank, according to 
Lancaster city officials, and work at both came to an abrupt halt in late 1988 
because of the company's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Today, an alluring billboard of Marilyn Monroe at the Legends tract near 30th 
Street West and Avenue J fronts a suburban ghost town. There are about 25 
dilapidated structures -- completed model houses and partially built frames -- 
in an otherwise empty field. Vandals and transients are a recurring problem and 
arson is always a fear, according to city and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is somewhat different at the larger Silverado tract near 30th 
Street West and Avenue L, where most of the 200-plus houses were sold and 
occupied. Thirteen unfinished houses, however, had to be boarded up after they 
became hangouts for gang members and vandals who left behind a miniature 
wasteland of graffiti and destruction.

BERNSON DESERVES CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not surprising that people's trust in local politics is waning when faced 
with conduct like Councilman Hal Bernson's. 
</P>
<P>
His response to overwhelming opposition to his own pet project, Porter Ranch, 
has ranged from disinterest to implied threats. His most recent remarks are 
truly outrageous. In his reaction to news that the city of Simi Valley is 
pursuing legal action against the Porter Ranch plan, Bernson says citizens 
"hoodwinked" and "duped" a government. 
</P>
<P>
There is no don for the Valley. Bernson acts like he wants to make offers that 
people can't refuse. Let's get a grip and proceed in a democratic, responsible 
way.

BERNSON DESERVES PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson should be praised for his efforts to reopen schools in 
his district while building a school in Porter Ranch at no cost to us 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
I agree that the school board is "totally out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Where is Kornstein, our so-called representative? She is busy purchasing the 
Ambassador Hotel and transporting our children on buses for year-round 
education, and at the same time cutting our educators' salary. 
</P>
<P>
I feel we should rally behind Bernson since he understands our district, which 
has grown and prospered during his term in office.

BERNSON'S WRONG TO BLAME SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in regards to your article of 7-25-90 entitled "Bernson 
Criticizes Lands Suit." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Bernson's opinion, Simi Valley did not act rashly in voting to sue 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they are as sick of Los Angeles' political shenanigans as Los Angeles 
residents are. The environmental impact report, prepared by the developer at 
his expense, does not adequately address the issues or show solutions to the 
problems that this massive Porter Ranch project will spread to all surrounding 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
To blame Simi Valley residents for all the traffic on the Simi freeway is 
ludicrous. There are jobs and industry in Simi and Moorpark where Simi Valley 
residents work. Bernson's proposal of "an employment tax against non-Los 
Angeles residents" who commute is just another example of his shortsighted, 
developer-oriented "Band-Aid" brand of politics. 
</P>
<P>
It is especially interesting that Bernson thinks PRIDE members have 
"hoodwinked, sweet-talked, duped or whatever by Simi Valley into initiating a 
lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
If what Bernson says is the truth, PRIDE was able to accomplish quite a feat. 
PRIDE didn't seem to have enough sophistication to get the Los Angeles City 
Council members or the Mayor to respond to the legitimate concerns voiced by 
PRIDE.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSE OF YAHWEH ZONING APPEAL DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council has unanimously denied an appeal by the House of 
Yahweh for an exemption to a zoning regulation requiring that an addition to 
its soup kitchen be set back 10 feet from the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after nearly an hour of testimony at a public hearing 
Thursday night and more than a month after the Planning Commission voted 3-1 to 
deny the charitable agency's request for a variance. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the two-story addition, on 147th Street near City Hall, was halted in 
May after city officials discovered that in granting a building permit, they 
had overlooked a regulation in the surrounding civic overlay zone that requires 
new buildings to sit behind a 10-foot landscaped strip bordering the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said that there were not sufficient legal grounds to grant the 
variance, but that they would consider reimbursing the House of Yahweh for some 
of the expenses caused by the mistakes of city employees. The House of Yahweh 
has said it spent more than $35,000 on planning, demolition, grading and 
foundation work at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carol Norman said many properties in the civic overlay zone, a 
six-block area surrounding City Hall, may be too small to easily accommodate 
the setback requirement. She asked the Planning Department to determine if the 
zoning rule should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
But Sister Michele Morris, the House of Yahweh's executive director, said she 
held little hope that the city would revise its ordinance any time soon. She 
said she would go ahead and have new building plans drawn. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll start again with something bigger and better," Morris said.

INTEREST IN OLD BIKES IS BALLOONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is an Orange County-based free-lance writer who 
often contributes to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an age when bike manufacturers race to produce the lightest, fastest machine 
on two wheels, Rod Monday prefers to plod along on 65 pounds of gleaming metal 
known as a 1950 Schwinn Phantom. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll tire you out," says Monday, whose only concession to modern technology 
is a three-speed gearshift installed on the old frame. 
</P>
<P>
For Monday and a growing number of vintage bike enthusiasts, it matters little 
that their bikes aren't the fastest on their blocks. 
</P>
<P>
While other cyclists weigh the merits of carbon fiber and titanium frames, 
vintage collectors want a bike loaded with gizmos: balloon tires, bells and 
buzzers, streamlined battery tanks, funky headlights andthose shiny chrome 
fenders. 
</P>
<P>
Monday rides his Phantom on the boardwalk near his Newport Beach home every 
day, then polishes the fenders and frame until the bike shines the way it would 
have on a Christmas morning 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my baby," he says. 
</P>
<P>
His enthusiasm for old bikes is shared by at least 3,000 collectors nationwide, 
says James Hurd, curator of the Schwinn History Center in Chicago. The museum, 
the "King Tut's tomb of bicycles," has about 700 bikes dating to the 1860s and 
50,000 bicycle-related items. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting vintage bikes is "an infant hobby that has just woken up," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Some buy old bikes as an investment. On rare occasions, bikes found at garage 
sales have been resold for up to $10,000, Hurd says. Collectors have seen 
prices for balloon-tire bikes inflate five-fold in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the real reason many treasure vintage bikes is not to make money, but to 
live out a long-cherished childhood fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
"Riding one of these," Hurd says, "makes you feel like a kid again." 
</P>
<P>
While turn-of-the-century bikes have always been considered collectibles, Hurd 
says it's the later models produced in the '30s, '40s and '50s that have caught 
fire with collectors. 
</P>
<P>
"They remind us of an era when we first had mobility but limited 
responsibility. You could jump on one of these bikes and in a minute and a half 
you'd be far enough from home where you couldn't hear your mother calling you 
to mow the lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Hurd sounds just like a kid when he says: "There's nothing like putting a 
baseball card in a clothes pin, clipping it on the fender brace and placing it 
in the wheel so it sounds like a motor." 
</P>
<P>
Vintage bikes have grow especially popular with the baby boom generation, whose 
parents often couldn't afford to buy them the bikes when they were children. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, 46, remembers looking longingly at ads for the Phantom in the back of 
comic books. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted one, but my dad made 90 cents an hour and he said 'No way,' " 
he says. The bikes originally cost $79.95, a large sum in those days but not as 
large as what they sell for today. Monday recently turned down an offer of 
$2,500 for his Phantom. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere Monday rides his Phantom, passers-by greet him with stares and the 
same old jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"They always say, 'Oh, it's a Pee Wee bike.' Then they make that laugh Pee Wee 
Herman makes," Monday says with a shudder. "If it happens one more time, I'm 
gonna. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Monday can blame Pedal Pusher in Newport Beach for his troubles. The vintage 
bicycle store restored a 1948 red Schwinn DX for the movie, "Pee Wee's Big 
Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
"The producer came in here, saw the bike and took it back to the studio. Then 
we got a call from the studio saying they needed 13 bikes exactly like it," 
says Mike Vorgang, owner of Pedal Pusher. "We were calling all over the country 
looking for parts" to build more bikes. 
</P>
<P>
Vorgang and his mother, Gertrude, started restoring and selling vintage bikes 
15 years ago. Pedal Pusher now helps Monday and others rebuild bikes from parts 
they find nationwide, using old catalogues to figure out how the machines 
looked when they rolled off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Schwinn introduced the first bike with balloon tires in Chicago in 1933, Hurd 
says. The cycles had 26-inch frames and 2.125-inch-wide whitewall tires. They 
remained an industry standard until 1959, when 10-speeds with skinny tires took 
over the market. 
</P>
<P>
About 38 million balloon-tire bikes were produced from the '30s to the '50s, 
but finding them in good condition isn't easy. The batteries in the tanks that 
operated the front headlights and electric horns leaked, corroding the tank and 
frame, Vorgang says. 
</P>
<P>
Young owners also sometimes stripped the bikes, yanking off fenders to make 
them lighter and faster. Years of neglect, damp weather and dirt did the rest 
of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some lucky collectors have found old bikes mostly intact at garage sales 
and swap meets. One collector found a Black Phantom for $35 at a garage sale, 
Hurd says. Phantoms, among the most sought-after of the classic bikes, usually 
sell for about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Balloon-tire bikes can still be found at affordable prices, and they all have 
a personality," Hurd says. "The Schwinn Streamline Aero Cycle had outlandish 
lines, with a tank that wrapped around the front." A headlight shone from the 
tank instead of its usual position atop the front fender. 
</P>
<P>
Many models like the Aero Cycle had an aerodynamic look, which did as much to 
increase their speed as streamlining did for the toaster. Says Vorgang: "The 
bikes just look like they go fast." 
</P>
<P>
Bike buffs range from weekend hobbyists with one or two vintage bikes to 
serious collectors who stock their garages with museum-quality cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Jed Donahoe, his wife and three sons all ride vintage bikes. They float on the 
fat tires, sounding their horns and bells. "The bikes turn heads when we ride 
them," says Donahoe, a Huntington Beach resident. 
</P>
<P>
His son Colin, 11, has a 1947 Schwinn DX much like Pee Wee's that he and his 
father assembled from parts and painted cranberry and cream. "Most of my 
friends like the old horn and the things they used to have on the bikes back 
then," Colin says. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Miller built a 500-square-foot cottage in back of his Buena Park home to 
house his collection of rare, antique bikes, which he jokingly calls "the dirty 
dozen." 
</P>
<P>
Miller favors turn-of-the-century bicycles, such as his 1884 high wheel safety 
cycle by Smith Machine (it's called the Star). With the help of four or five 
machinists, he restored luster to the cycle's spindly, nickel-plated frame. 
</P>
<P>
The bike sold for $135 when new, making it a rare specimen because only the 
wealthy could afford to buy one. It differs from most high wheels because it 
has a small wheel in front instead of in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Miller sold off a larger collection of balloon-tire bikes for the earlier 
models because he likes the handiwork that went into the antique bikes. "I was 
an art major in college and this is metal art," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For him, the fun part of collecting bikes is "the hunt and the find. You can 
still find these bikes in secondhand stores." 
</P>
<P>
When found, most vintage bikes look like Miller's '34 Aero Cycle, with its 
rusty handlebars, corroded frame and red tires shredded. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors easily spend more than $1,000 lavishing chrome and paint on the 
bikes so they look new. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bailey, owner of Vintage Cycle Saddles in Long Beach, has made a full-time 
job out of restoring old leather saddles for balloon-tire bicycles. Demand for 
the saddles is great, especially those for the Schwinn Phantoms. Bailey 
restores 50 to 60 bicycle seats a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually the seats are dilapidated," Bailey says. "The springs are rusty and 
the leather is gone. It looks like they came out of a junkyard." 
</P>
<P>
He restores the saddles by re-plating the metal, making new pads and adding 
fresh leather. The saddles cost from $80 to $450 for his top-of-the-line 
toolbox saddle, which has a toolbox built into the back of the seat. 
</P>
<P>
As the supply of original bikes and parts dwindles, some companies, like 
Columbia, have re-issued classic models. 
</P>
<P>
"The nostalgia look is going strong in all of the hobbies," Miller says. "It's 
kind of an escape." 
</P>

ARIZONA'S PETRIFIED FOREST IS STEALING AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the only national park with a fence around it to protect it from the 
public. The 150-mile fence was built to keep visitors from stealing the park's 
greatest resource -- petrified wood. 
</P>
<P>
In other national parks, rangers spend most of their time interpreting unique 
features. Here, rangers concentrate on preventing people from walking away with 
those features. 
</P>
<P>
This is the site -- 94,000 acres and 27 miles long -- of the nation's largest 
and grandest collection of petrified wood. 
</P>
<P>
But the wood is disappearing and steps to stem the tide are increasing. In 
remote areas of the park, rangers patrol on horseback. Other rangers peer down 
on wood poachers from low-flying planes. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers perched at secluded spots around the park use binoculars to guard 
pieces of the 225-million-year-old trees-turned-to-stone. Signs warning 
"Removing Petrified Wood Is Prohibited" are posted throughout Petrified Forest 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
But, the park is too big. And rangers say there are not enough of them to watch 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
So each day, visitors steal away with pieces of the colorful wood, a tradition 
dating back to soldiers in the mid-1800s. The soldiers, the first non-Indians 
to see these lands, packed petrified wood in their saddlebags for souvenirs and 
galloped into the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
In his book "Petrified Forest: The Story Behind The Scenery," Utah geologist 
Sidney Ash writes: "Bit by bit, pieces of wood are removed by basically honest 
people, stealing it from all of us and future generations. As the National Park 
Service continues the struggle to preserve petrified wood, an estimated 25,000 
pounds are removed from the park each year." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago, David May, then chief naturalist at the park, told this 
writer: "Honest citizens who wouldn't think of stealing a candy bar from a 
grocery store or a newspaper from an unattended stand, are blithely stealing 
their children's heritage." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1906, Teddy Roosevelt set aside these lands for the nation's Second National 
Monument in hopes of saving for future generations what petrified wood was 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The famous conservationist John Muir had met with Roosevelt a year earlier. He 
told the President that petrified wood was being shipped by the railroad 
carloads "back East to make jewelry, book ends, table tops, mantel pieces and 
curios." The national monument became a national park in 1962. But the 
pocketing of the petrified wood continues. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, assignment here is the most frustrating park job for rangers. 
Kerry Isensee, 38, the park's chief ranger, explains: "We are suspicious of 
everyone. That really is disturbing and not a healthy attitude. People go 
through such lengths to deceive you. It really makes you wonder." 
</P>
<P>
As visitors approach the two exits, signs warn: "Vehicle Inspection Ahead." 
When they spot the sign, many visitors toss their petrified wood souvenirs out 
car windows. Others simply ignore the sign. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone leaving the park is questioned by a ranger at the exit station: "Did 
you take any petrified wood?" Almost always, said Isensee, the answer is, "No." 
</P>
<P>
"We know many are lying. They have it hidden in their shoes, in camera cases, 
in the glove compartment, in the trunk. Some sit on it. Some women tuck small 
pieces into their bras," said the ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, rangers would spot-check cars. Because people complained about the 
intrusion, the checks were discontinued, recalled Park Supt. Gary Cummins. "Now 
we check cars if there is probable cause -- one visitor reporting on another 
visitor or rangers in the field observing removal of petrified wood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every day at least one carload of visitors is caught leaving with wood. 
If they have just a few chips, the offenders usually receive a lecture on the 
severity of the problem. If it is more than a few chips, they are cited and 
fined $35 for up to five pounds, $1 a pound for each additional pound. 
</P>
<P>
If it is a major theft, an arrest is made. This happened a few months ago when 
three men were caught with 1,000 pounds of petrified wood. They were tried and 
found guilty of committing a felony, fined $1,000, placed on probation and 
banned from the park for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Al Veitl, a former park superintendent, has estimated that one of every five 
visitors leaves with chips, pieces or chunks of petrified wood. 
</P>
<P>
Resource management specialist Carl Bowman, 36, first came here 16 years ago as 
a ranger. "We have tried to find the solution ever since I've been here, and I 
know everyone before my time did likewise. But we still don't know what to do," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions have been as far-fetched as chaining pit bulls to every log to 
locking the gates and keeping everyone out. The Park Service has considered 
installing closed-circuit TV in areas of heavy wood concentrations or closing 
the park to all traffic except a park-run fleet of conducted tour buses. 
Studies on how to diminish or eliminate the problem are ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
This summer Doug Scher, 25, a Kansas State University graduate student, is 
trying to learn how much and how fast petrified wood is leaving the park. He 
has 60 study plots each filled with about 60 pounds of wood, each piece marked 
with an invisible dye that shows up under an ultraviolet light. 
</P>
<P>
Scher has taken petrified wood from disposal piles near the "Vehicle Inspection 
Ahead" sign, marked it and placed it in his study plots. Now the marked pieces 
are showing up in the disposal piles. Scher believes that by the end of summer 
he will know how fast the study plots are being depleted, how much is thrown 
out of the cars at the exit and how much is leaving the park. 
</P>
<P>
All Petrified Forest National Park publications urge visitors not to take 
petrified wood. "Please do not take even smallest pieces of petrified wood," 
warns one. "The small pieces quickly amount to tons." 
</P>
<P>
A 17-minute film, shown at the Visitor's Center, describes a forest of giant 
150- to 200-foot-high ancient conifers were transformed from trees to stone. 
The theft problem is also brought up in the film. 
</P>
<P>
In the Visitor's Center, there is a "conscience" display of letters from 
one-time visitors who have returned stolen petrified wood with an apology. 
</P>
<P>
A letter from a Louisiana man reads: "I took this petrified wood in direct 
defiance of posted signs. Ever since, I have experienced bad luck. I lost my 
job. The pipes in the house exploded, ruining carpeting and furniture. My wife 
was in an automobile accident. I was hospitalized with a bad back and began 
losing my hair. I am returning the petrified wood. Hopefully my luck will 
change." 
</P>
<P>
A spectacularly colored 93-pound section of a petrified tree was shipped back 
to the park a few weeks ago from a family who had inherited it. They said their 
relative had taken it from the park during a visit in the 1930s and they 
believed it should be returned. 
</P>
<P>
"It is gratifying when someone returns petrified wood. But it is really 
disheartening that so many people continue to steal the one resource the park 
was created to protect 84 years ago," sighed Bowman. 
</P>

At a time when most people groan, grunt and pant, Susan Sullivan speaks French. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an unusual exercise class at a small Portland health club, Sullivan 
and a few classmates get together twice a week to ride exercise bicycles while 
taking French lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, you don't think about the riding part at all," said Sullivan, an 
elementary school principal. "You just automatically think about the French. 
Your body becomes automatic." 
</P>
<P>
The lessons are offered at Corner on Health, a homey athletic club that 
recently started a similar Spanish class and offers another course in which 
bike riders watch classic movies while they pedal. 
</P>
<P>
The French classes, which started last winter, feature eight to 10 riders in a 
semicircle in front of Kim Brown, a Portland State University professor, who 
teaches the class in return for a free club membership. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the classes are mainly oral, with little reading or homework. 
</P>
<P>
"What that means is I needed to adjust the teaching schedule so there is more 
repetition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Students pay $35 for a six-week session. Four-week sessions this summer will 
cost only $25. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the hourlong session, participants are tired and sweaty, but not 
so breathless that they are unable to speak their newly learned French, said 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Students largely decide what the classes will study, which so far has ranged 
from travel phrases to camp songs. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our share of the equivalent of '99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellie Hodder, owner of Corner on Health, said she knows of no other clubs that 
combine exercise classes and language lessons, although a few Portland-area 
facilities have expressed an interest in copying her idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I invented this," said Hodder, whose 2-year-old operation is tucked in a 
plain-looking building in an industrial area. It is a far cry from the athletic 
shoe-commercial trendiness of yuppie clubs. Hodder's club features a 
book-trading table, a seminar on how to write a resume and a class that 
prepares overweight women to walk a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
The language-bicycle courses grew out of a desire to create classes that allow 
people to do something they enjoy while also getting a workout, Hodder said. 
</P>
<P>
She originally wanted to offer a Spanish class but could find no one to teach 
it. Brown already worked out at the club and offered to teach French. This 
spring, Brown found another Portland State instructor to teach the new Spanish 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Hodder also persuaded a company that makes stationary bicycles to loan her club 
15 of the machines; in return, she features the brand name in flyers and 
mentions it often in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The film class has generally been smaller than the French class, perhaps in 
part because an entire movie can present some riders with a daunting workout, 
Hodder said. For example, she said that during one 115-minute film, several of 
the male riders quit. 
</P>
<P>
"The women toughed it out," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said she usually takes some sort of exercise class at Hodder's club 
and started the French course because it "sounded like fun." She stuck with it 
through three six-week sessions, but has now switched to Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"This last term we had beginners, and so now instead of being the stupidest 
person in the class, I'm one of the more intelligent students," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Hodder said she doesn't expect students to learn a language fluently while 
pedaling away, merely to become conversational. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to do something where you can go on a vacation and feel 
comfortable," she said.

SENATE VOTES TO SCALE BACK ON 'STAR WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major rebuff to President Bush, the Senate voted Saturday to overhaul the 
controversial "Star Wars" program and slow the President's plans for a possible 
early deployment of the "Brilliant Pebbles" anti-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected setback for the White House came as the Senate gave final 
approval to a $289-billion defense bill for fiscal 1991 by a margin of 79 to 16 
and departed on a monthlong summer recess. The House adjourned on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The defense spending measure adopted by the Senate is $18 billion less than 
sought by the President but $6 billion more than recently approved by the House 
Armed Services Committee. The House will take up the defense budget after it 
returns from its recess. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate legislation represents a relatively modest adjustment to the 
dramatically reduced Soviet threat to Western Europe, and opponents said that 
they favored much larger cuts in next year's military outlays. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the Senate gave final congressional approval to a bill 
allocating $4 billion over five years for treatment of AIDS patients and grants 
to cities hard hit by the disease. It also passed a $29-billion appropriation 
bill that threatens to withhold highway funds from states that do not pass laws 
suspending the drivers' licenses of convicted drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
In an early morning voice vote, the Senate adopted a 1991 intelligence budget 
that would eliminate U.S. support for a covert war in Cambodia and reduce 
funding for rebels in Afghanistan, sources told the Associated Press. Most of 
the bill's provisions are secret. 
</P>
<P>
The House, meanwhile, voted unanimously to increase the potential oil spill 
liability of shippers and require double hulls on all tankers by the year 2010. 
The measure now goes to Bush, who is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate-approved revisions in the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known 
as "Star Wars," would impose considerably more congressional oversight on the 
futuristic missile defense program conceived during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted in favor of the restrictions despite opponents' contentions 
that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week had shown that SDI might be needed to 
defend against limited missile raids from smaller nations as well as possible 
major attacks by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 54 to 44 along party lines, the Senate slashed $200 million from the 
President's requested funding for research on Brilliant Pebbles, thousands of 
small rocket weapons that would be placed in orbit so they could seek out and 
destroy incoming missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted to freeze Brilliant Pebbles funding at its current level of 
$129 million and delay indefinitely a planned presidential decision in 1993 on 
whether to deploy the weapons. It also directed a greater focus on ground-based 
missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill would limit overall spending on SDI to $3.7 billion next year, 
compared to current funding of about $3.8 billion. Bush is seeking $4.7 billion 
for the program, while the pending House defense measure would reduce it to 
$2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The "Star Wars" restrictions were endorsed by Senate Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who noted that the Pentagon has proposed four 
different SDI systems in four years, while the Administration has not indicated 
where it would find the estimated $100 billion needed to pay for the first 
phase of the program over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to do is send them (the President and his aides) a message 
on phase one and tell them to get off this kick of a 1993 deployment decision, 
which doesn't make any sense," Nunn told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the changes, however, noted that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
possesses short-range missiles. "We need to support the President in taking 
decisive action against this kind of threat," Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) said. 
</P>
<P>
In another move affecting SDI, the Senate voted, 97 to 1, to earmark $300 
million of SDI research funds for weapons that could be used against tactical 
missiles that might one day be fired by terrorists or outlaw countries. 
</P>
<P>
The White House fought unsuccessfully to defeat an amendment by Sens. Jeff 
Bingaman (D-N. M.) and Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.) that called for a 
restructuring of SDI, placing more emphasis on basic research rather than 
possible deployment in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, 52 Democrats and two Republicans voted for the changes, while 42 
Republicans and two Democrats sided with Bush in the dispute over exotic space 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, however, killed separate attempts to trim $594 million and $400 
million from SDI funds after Nunn indicated that he wanted to preserve the 
Senate's bargaining position in a conference with the House on the 
controversial programs. 
</P>
<P>
While some Administration officials have warned that Bush would veto the 
legislation if SDI priorities were altered, both Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner 
of Virginia, the Republican floor manager, said they had not been told that 
Bush would reject the measure as it now stands. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a liberal critic, voted against the bill, 
contending that it did not cut Pentagon spending enough. "We don't need all 
this exotic weaponry," he told the Senate. "I'd rather have brilliant students 
than Brilliant Pebbles." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, however, insisted that the bill took into account the lessened Soviet 
threat without endangering the national security. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would substantially reshape the nation's conventional forces, 
recognizing that the threat of an invasion of Western Europe has nearly 
evaporated. But it proceeds more cautiously in trimming the strategic nuclear 
arsenal, reflecting a concern that the Soviets are continuing to modernize 
their own long-range bombers, missiles and submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would kill off most of the 13 weapons programs proposed by Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney for termination. It also would cancel 15 other programs, 
the most significant being the MILSTAR communications satellite, saving $1.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
By a narrow margin, the Senate voted to continue production of the B-2 Stealth 
bomber, authorizing $4.6 billion to develop the radar-eluding plane and buy two 
more. 
</P>
<P>
It also approved development funds for the two mobile intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, the Midgetman and the MX, but it denied $1.1 billion 
requested to begin buying launcher trains for the MX. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved $1.2 billion for an 18th Trident missile-launching 
submarine. But it denied the entire $1.7 billion requested for two C-17 cargo 
planes and all the money -- reported to be about $1.5 billion -- requested to 
build A-12 bombers for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
It also reduced the amounts requested to develop the ATF fighter plane and the 
new armed helicopter designated LH. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would steer the Pentagon toward a proportionally greater reliance on 
National Guard and reserve forces, rather than active-duty units. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the reduction of more than 38,000 military personnel recommended by 
Cheney, it would cut active-duty personnel by 100,000 from the current level of 
2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, active-duty personnel would be reduced to 1.6 million, a cut of more 
than 20%. The Army would absorb the biggest cuts, shrinking over five years by 
one-third, to 510,000, as its traditional mission of guarding Western Europe 
becomes less pressing. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require that the Pentagon remove 50,000 of the 311,000 Army and 
Air Force personnel stationed in Europe. The President could waive that 
requirement by certifying to Congress that it was not in the national security 
interest.

BUSH AVOIDS THREATS, PRESSES IRAQ SANCTIONS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, advised by national security aides that Iraq did not appear to 
be bent on an immediate invasion of Saudi Arabia, pressed diplomatic and 
economic sanctions against the Saddam Hussein regime Saturday while avoiding 
threats of military action. 
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that although Bush and his aides concluded that Iraq 
neither wants nor needs to invade Saudi Arabia at this time, the Administration 
is aware of troop movements within Iraq that would increase that nation's 
ability to launch a successful attack if it chooses that course. 
</P>
<P>
And a senior government official, who asked not to be identified, again 
stressed Hussein's unpredictability, noting, "It's difficult to put yourself in 
his shoes and decide what he might do -- and none of us believes invading 
Kuwait would be his end goal." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. actions at this time appear designed to isolate Hussein politically and 
economically while defusing the tense situation by playing down prospects for a 
military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, after a meeting of Bush and his national security advisers at 
the Camp David, Md., presidential retreat, issued a low-key statement saying 
that all options are "under consideration" and that the United States still 
seeks the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and "restoration of 
the legitimate government of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials, playing down the prospects of a military 
confrontation, said that any American forces assigned to the Persian Gulf will 
not include U.S. rapid deployment forces and that no U.S. bombers or tactical 
warplanes are preparing for deployment in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, sources close to the Saudi government said, in the event of 
an Iraqi invasion, the Saudis would request U.S. military assistance only as a 
last resort -- and only then with great reluctance -- and would much prefer to 
meet any Iraqi threat with assistance from other Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials, briefing senators Saturday on Capitol Hill, also 
stressed that reports of 20 Americans being seized by Iraqi forces from a 
vessel docked in Kuwait were apparently untrue. Officials confirmed Baghdad 
reports that 11 American oil field workers swept up in Kuwait by the invasion 
force have been released in Baghdad. Three others have not been accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed al Mashat denied 
that Iraq has "any designs" on Saudi Arabia and insisted that the two countries 
have excellent relations. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that Iraq plans to start withdrawing its invasion force of 
100,000 troops from Kuwait. But in what was an otherwise moderate statement, he 
warned that Iraq would deal "thoroughly" with any aggression or threats to its 
national security and said such acts would end the troop pullout. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials discounted the withdrawal promise and appeared to be 
increasingly pessimistic about Hussein's forces being dislodged in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
One senior U.S. official suggested that other Arab countries may decide to 
acquiesce in the forming of a new puppet regime in Kuwait by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"If the other Arab countries decide they don't want a confrontation with 
Saddam, the forming of a provisional government gives them a fig leaf," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Defense Department official about Iraq's neighboring nations, "I 
wouldn't put a plugged nickel on the Arabs getting their act together on this 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Hussein does next, U.S. officials believe he will make no major move 
at least until after the weekend. "I think we'll just see a weekend of people 
talking with each other," a senior government official said. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official said that Washington will focus its efforts on "economic 
sanctions, trying to keep people from buying Iraqi oil, trying to keep people 
from selling arms to them, trying to isolate Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-nation European Community imposed an embargo on oil imports from Iraq 
and Kuwait Saturday, froze all Kuwaiti assets and imposed a ban on sales to 
Iraq. The action, described as the strongest punitive measures ever taken by 
the EC, was aimed at pressuring Iraq to immediately withdraw its forces from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has been telephoning the leaders of other countries urging them to 
join in the sanctions, spoke Friday night with West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, French President Francois Mitterrand and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday, U.S. officials have been guarded 
about possible military intervention, although they have emphasized that all 
options are under consideration. The beefing up of U.S. naval forces in the 
Persian Gulf region is about the only break from routine military exercises, 
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the senators who attended Saturday's briefings with intelligence 
officials would discuss specific options being weighed in the event of an Iraqi 
attack on Saudi Arabia. But several members of Congress have said that U.S. 
military intervention would be inevitable if an invasion occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, suggested possible retaliation by shutting down two pipelines 
through which Iraq exports most of its crude oil to the outside world. One of 
the pipelines crosses Saudi Arabia, and some U.S. analysts fear that Iraq may 
invade Saudi Arabia in part to make that facility secure. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said that Iraqi intentions toward Saudi Arabia 
are "totally unclear" at this point, but he and other senators who attended the 
intelligence briefing agreed that the Iraqis pose a "serious" military threat 
to the Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have seven divisions and about 2,000 tanks in Kuwait, which is more 
than enough to take Saudi Arabia . . . and their closest units are within five 
miles of the border," said Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
Most senators said that if Bush were to order a military attack, it probably 
would be restricted to naval and air actions and would not involve U.S. ground 
troops. The action would have to be ordered in concert with other countries, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no possibility of American troops being sent to (Saudi) soil, but there 
are other military options we could undertake in concert with other nations," 
Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, American naval forces steamed toward the Persian Gulf, but U.S. 
ground and air forces continued their normal routines, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Washington issued no alerts to U.S. Army or Air Force troops in the 
field, Pentagon war planners worked feverishly to complete contingency plans in 
case Iraqi troops move into Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans would apparently involve the XVIII Airborne Corps, the nation's 
most rapidly deployable force of Army troops. That force of over 85,000 troops, 
fortified by tank units from more heavily armed U.S. divisions, could begin 
arriving in the region within a week and could be at full strength in a little 
over three weeks, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials emphasized, however, that without an invitation from Saudi 
Arabia, no American forces could hope to arrive on the scene quickly enough 
either to deter an Iraqi thrust or thwart one if it was under way. 
</P>
<P>
"People are waiting for the other shoe to drop overseas," one knowledgeable 
Pentagon source said. "Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates -- those 
people basically have to make the first move. But, obviously, there's a point 
after which it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
Another Pentagon official said, "The first, absolute requirement is that the 
Saudis have to want us. If the Saudis don't say, 'Come,' and Saddam's troops 
cross the border," the Iraqis will make tremendous advances before the 
Americans can get there. 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. officials delicately pressing that point on a reluctant Saudi Arabia, 
the Pentagon took the only steps it could by moving naval forces to the region. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Independence Battle Group, a total of eight ships and 75 
aircraft, was fast approaching the Arabian Sea, where it was expected to 
position itself at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Already an armada of eight 
U.S. ships, including a destroyer, a cruiser and five frigates, was plying the 
waters inside the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Eisenhower, with seven escort ships, was in the eastern 
Mediterranean. From its current position, the carrier's aircraft could reach 
parts of Saudi Arabia, or the carrier could transit the Suez Canal into the Red 
Sea. In Mayport, Fla., the carrier Saratoga, with the battleship Wisconsin and 
nine other ships as well as an amphibious assault force of 2,000 Marines, 
prepared for deployment to the Mediterranean early this week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, equipment and supplies to support a Marine expeditionary brigade of 
16,500 men for 30 days was headed toward the Persian Gulf.

WHAT DO IRAQIS THINK? IN CLIMATE OF FEAR, FEW CLUES

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's brutal thrust into Kuwait has been etched in black throughout 
the world, but there is no certain sign showing how it plays on the streets of 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-war protests, or even murmurs, are unknown in the capital, whatever might 
be on the Iraqis' minds. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's is a silent society, cowed by knock-in-the-night internal security. 
But in troubled times it can also be strongly nationalistic, streaked with 
pride over the country's hard-fought war that drove an Iranian enemy into 
submission in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
What do ordinary Iraqis want? How do they see themselves in the world? 
</P>
<P>
For visitors to Iraq, the answers are difficult to plumb, because most Iraqis 
have been conditioned to display exaggerated caution around outside influences 
-- a sort of safe-side xenophobia. Alert to the watchful eyes and keen ears of 
security agents and their informers, very few will speak with foreigners 
outside the demands of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Iraqis may now be wondering what they are doing occupying Kuwait, the 
country that helped them most in their war against Iran -- but if so, they are 
not wondering out loud," one Western diplomat who was based in the Persian Gulf 
region for years said in an interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat who was stationed in Baghdad throughout the Iran-Iraq War 
agreed. "You could never get close to ordinary Iraqis," he said. "The only ones 
we could talk to without putting them in jeopardy were our drivers, cooks and 
maids -- and they were all government agents." 
</P>
<P>
But some signs emerge, often contradictory. For instance, educated and informed 
Iraqis often expressed disgust over the high-handed antics of Kuwaiti men who 
trekked north to Basra and Baghdad for whiskey-filled weekends, banned in their 
own country. For tradition-minded rural Iraqis, such behavior was even more 
shocking. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as Hussein opened the doors to small private business over the 
past two years, Iraqi merchants knew what their countrymen wanted: all the 
luxury items that filled the shops of the neighboring Persian Gulf sheikdoms. 
</P>
<P>
Along the broad streets of Baghdad, entrepreneurs stocked shelves with the 
latest household conveniences, import cosmetics and other symbols of the 
Western world. The Iraqis cannot afford the prices, and many good-life 
boutiques have gone sour, but customers still press against the windows for a 
covetous look. 
</P>
<P>
There is perhaps no sharper example of Iraqi desires than the long lines at 
embassy visa offices. After nearly a decade of banning foreign travel, Hussein 
-- who has not visited a Western capital in more than a decade -- relaxed the 
restrictions last February. Tens of thousands have jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't you?" a retired chemist told a visitor soon after the ban was lifted. 
"I want to go to the States." 
</P>
<P>
One benefit of Hussein's regime, which he describes as Arab socialist, has been 
a sharp jump in literacy in Iraq, making it one of the best-read nations in the 
Arab world. In art, architecture and literature, the country of 17 million 
produces at a worldly level. Galleries display abstract and Arabic-evocative 
paintings that have won critical praise in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, because they have been repeatedly drawn in by wars throughout 
their history, "they really do take pride in seeing themselves as the hard men 
of the Arab world," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
But the long years of Hussein's jingoism -- he has formally been in power since 
1979 -- his insistence that Iraqi culture is superior and his glorification of 
the ancient Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations have a dark side as well. 
</P>
<P>
One shameful example is the Iraqi treatment of the millions of foreign workers 
who have kept the economy running both during and after the war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Asian workers -- Filipinos, Thais and Pakistanis -- are treated shabbily in 
many Arab countries. The Iraqis have extended the behavior to their Arab 
brethren, Egyptians and Sudanese, as well. In a common scene at Baghdad's 
International Airport, hundreds of Egyptian laborers are forced to sit in the 
hallways while other travelers take chairs in half-empty lounges. 
</P>
<P>
And Hussein's regime can be equally brutal to its own people. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the gulf war, when things were going badly for Iraq and the strain was 
beginning to show on the populace, Hussein came up with a way to lower what was 
said to be a high rate of desertion from the Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
Any deserter who was caught -- and that was most of them -- was taken to his 
home and executed in front of his family, which was then made to pay for the 
bullets used to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
One French diplomat, leaving Baghdad after several years there, had this to 
say: "This is a very heavy place. The things that are natural in most places 
are unnatural here. To take a picture, to go outside the city, to be irreverent 
-- all these are forbidden. When you see someone smile, you think you have made 
a big discovery." 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that unites (Iraqis) is fear -- fear of their government," 
Augustus Richard Norton, a Middle East expert at the U.S. Military Academy in 
West Point, N.Y., declared. 
</P>
<P>
But even the Iraqi leader cannot get it all his way, and in times of economic 
stress -- like these -- the government line is to blame the outside world. 
Iraq's crushing foreign debt, for instance, is portrayed in the controlled 
press as an alien imposition, a view credited in part for the invasion of 
Kuwait, which rejected an Iraqi demand for erasure of its war debts. 
</P>
<P>
And occasionally hairline fissures appear on the surface of the ordinary 
Iraqis' hard shell. A few years ago, when the war with Iran was going badly for 
Iraq and casualties were high, an American visitor in Baghdad was surprised by 
the number of young men who nervously approached him to ask for help in 
obtaining a U.S. visa. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1986, the year of the "black flags" -- a symbol of mourning -- and there 
were so many war dead that virtually every residential street in the Iraqi 
capital was aflutter with them. Alarmed at the effect this sight was having on 
morale, the government banned the display of these homemade flags. 
</P>
<P>
But as the death toll mounted and food shortages worsened, the flags reappeared 
in spite of the ban -- a small but, in the Iraqi context, exceedingly brave 
display of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
These small gestures of dissent did not last long, however: The tide of battle 
began to change, for one thing, in part because of Iraq's then-widespread use 
of poison gas. But 1986 also was the year that Iraq passed a law making 
criticism of the government punishable by sentences ranging from seven years' 
imprisonment to death. 
</P>
<P>
The grim joke at the time was that, if you got sentenced to seven years, you 
might get lucky and have the punishment commuted to death. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the president's ego flows over his country in nightly newscasts: Hussein 
hosts Arab leaders, talks tough to the West, tours country villages surrounded 
by adoring children and a uniformed, black-bereted bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
What do the Iraqis think of it? How do they see their place in the world? No 
polls will be taken to tell. He is not appealing for support of himself or his 
policy. Hussein lays down the law, and his countrymen keep their counsel.

REASONS FOR GAS PRICE SURGE VARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When crude oil prices fell precipitously in early spring, gasoline prices did 
not. At the time, oil companies blamed rising demand and tight refining 
capacity, adding that changes in gasoline prices generally lag changes in crude 
prices by about 30 to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
But when crude oil prices skyrocketed late last week in the aftermath of the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, gasoline prices rose within a day despite assurances 
from oil companies that there remained ample stocks of crude oil that had been 
purchased at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups and some politicians are crying foul, accusing oil companies of 
price gouging and profiteering, invoking the specter of past price hikes after 
the Iran-Iraq war in 1979 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill last year. The 
increases threaten to stoke inflation and would likely place a heavy burden on 
low-income people for whom gasoline costs are a big family budget item. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies "are not going by the amount of oil available. They are raising 
prices because they see prices going up in the spot market," Ed Rothschild, 
spokesman for the consumer group Citizens-Labor Energy Coalition, said in the 
wake of Friday's higher prices at the pump. "They are cashing in on an 
opportunity, but this is nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, oil companies argue that they are simply passing on the higher 
new costs of oil and have no intention of exploiting a volatile situation. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a steady increase in the price of crude oil over the last two 
months," said Thomas Burns, manager of economics at Chevron Corp., which raised 
its wholesale gasoline prices by 5 cents a gallon Friday. "That is ultimately 
reflected in gasoline markets one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
The real reasons for the price hikes seem to lie somewhere in between the two 
sides, according to analysts and economists who have studied previous price 
swings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost entirely the result of structural changes in the oil market," said 
Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow at the Institute of International 
Economics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons cited for the quick price hikes are an effort to dampen 
demand and preserve inventories in anticipation of higher crude oil prices and 
potential shortages; industry practices that will have refiners paying higher 
crude oil prices almost immediately, even for oil ordered months ago; and 
transactions in the futures market that may require refiners to come up with 
extra cash quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, oil companies also see the potential to earn higher profits. 
</P>
<P>
During the late spring and early summer, when crude prices fell, gasoline 
prices remained high. At the time, oil companies blamed that lag on tight 
refining capacity, high demand and natural market delays. 
</P>
<P>
But refining profit margins rose to record levels during that period, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The profitability of a barrel of refined product peaked at $11 at that time, 
compared with a typical refining spread of about $4, said Bernard J. Picchi, an 
industry analyst with Salomon Bros., an investment firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The spread represents the difference between the wholesale price of a barrel of 
refined products and the cost of a barrel of crude from which those products 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, retail prices of gasoline had jumped by 4 cents to 14 cents per 
gallon around the country. On the wholesale level, refiners had raised their 
prices between 5 cents and 10 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
September contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of 
crude oil, have gained $4.45 a barrel since Monday and $2.95 since the 
invasion. On Friday, the contracts closed up $1.38 to $24.49 a barrel. On the 
spot market, crude oil prices jumped $1.25 to close at $24.40 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists drew parallels with the sharp hike in gasoline prices 
immediately following the massive oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound 
from the Exxon Valdez oil tanker in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks after that spill, which closed the Valdez, Alaska, marine terminal 
for a time and threatened to crimp West Coast supplies of Alaskan crude oil, 
wholesale gasoline prices jumped between 10 cents and more than 70 cents per 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that hike was attributed to fears of a cutoff, although no real 
shortages developed. Wholesalers and distributors bought up available stocks of 
gasoline rapidly, leading to a sharp price hike. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the increases were also attributed to a simple desire by refiners to 
maximize profits while they could after a period of slim profit margins. As one 
retailer put it at the time, they didn't want to sell a gallon of gasoline one 
day that they might be able to sell for a higher price a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the same dynamics are at work now. Fear and uncertainty about the 
Middle East situation has led refiners to raise prices in anticipation of 
demand from buyers wanting to hoard gasoline stocks in fears of a shortage, 
although there is no sign that has happened. 
</P>
<P>
The argument is that price increases, while unpleasant and frustrating, 
nevertheless restrict demand and discourage hoarding that would exacerbate any 
real shortage of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Refiners are also raising prices to cover the expected costs of future barrels 
of oil, which analysts expect to remain high. "When companies set prices, they 
attempt to read what the correct market price will be" down the road a bit, 
Chevron's Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
But last week's price hikes also reflected real changes in oil markets, 
analysts said. Crude prices have been rising steadily since June, but gasoline 
prices have not kept pace, oil company officials argue. 
</P>
<P>
On June 21, spot prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil hit $15.30 a 
barrel, and wholesale spot prices for unleaded gasoline were 62 cents per 
gallon in New York, 60 cents per gallon on the Gulf Coast and 85 cents in Los 
Angeles, Verleger said. 
</P>
<P>
By last Thursday, crude prices had shot up to $23.30, but wholesale unleaded 
gasoline prices had only crept up to 69 cents a gallon in New York and 67 cents 
on the Gulf Coast, and had actually fallen in Los Angeles to 81 cents. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, demand for gasoline products on the West Coast has remained 
strong, while inventories of gasoline have been falling because of tight 
refining capacity. Although refineries have been running flat out, a string of 
accidents and shutdowns for routine maintenance has limited refinery capacity 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Exxon refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Benicia 
caught fire, halting some gasoline production. In July, a massive explosion 
idled an ARCO Chemical Co. petrochemical plant in Houston, which made a key 
gasoline component. 
</P>
<P>
What about the abundant inventories of crude oil that were bought at cheap 
prices? Companies are reluctant to draw down supplies too rapidly, given 
expected shortages and higher prices, analysts argue. Unlike the Valdez spill, 
the current Middle East turmoil promises to have longer-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is very reluctant to liquidate its inventory as a source of 
supply because it is cheap crude and they don't know how long this thing will 
continue," said Jack Aydin, an oil analyst with the investment firm of McDonald 
&amp; Co. in New York. "They sit on the inventories to reduce their risk, not 
knowing what's going to happen down the road." 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that oil companies have crude oil physically in inventory, the 
Iraqis have effectively increased the value of that crude over the last few 
days," added Michael Doyle, a market analyst with Computer Petroleum Corp., a 
research firm in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Peculiarities of oil company accounting practices also ensure that price hikes 
in the crude oil market find their way quickly to the gasoline pump, Verleger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil ordered from the Middle East a month ago was contracted but not paid 
for. It will be paid for at the prevailing price when it arrives in U.S. ports. 
So an increase in the world market price translates into an instantaneous 
increase in the cost of crude already on order, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, oil companies now hedge their investments in crude oil. Crude oil 
inventories in company tanks are hedged by futures contracts. If crude oil 
prices fall, the value of the physical crude stocks may also fall, but the 
value of the crude futures contracts rises, offsetting the loss. 
</P>
<P>
But when crude prices rise, as they are doing now, the value of the physical 
crude stocks may rise, but the company loses money on the futures contracts. To 
cover those losses, the companies need to come up with hard cash and therefore 
feel the need to raise wholesale product prices. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the profitability of marketers -- service stations and bulk 
distributors -- remained tight through the summer as they tried to keep retail 
prices stable. With refiners raising wholesale prices, many retailers now feel 
they have no choice but to raise prices. The impact of price increases on 
Californians was heightened by the onset of the 5-cent-per-gallon increase in 
the state gasoline tax last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason for the price hikes, no one expects them to fall again 
nearly as fast as they rose. 
</P>
<P>
"When prices go up substantially, marketers tend to pass through those 
increases as quickly as possible," said McDonald J. Beavers, president of 
Whitney Leigh Corp., a Tulsa, Okla., market research firm. "But when prices go 
down, (retailers reduce) them in smaller increments, looking over their 
shoulders at what the other guy is doing."

REPORTS OF ROBBERIES AND ASSAULTS ON BIKE PATHS IN LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE

<P>
Bill Evans considered it the code of the road to stop for a fellow cyclist in 
distress. What else was he to think of the guy waving that day from the side of 
the Los Angeles River bike path? 
</P>
<P>
Hunkered sheepishly over his rusty old bicycle, the man looked sadder than two 
flat tires and a busted chain. So Evans, a 52-year-old veteran cyclist, braked 
his customized mountain bike -- his option-loaded, cherry-red, $2,900 handmade 
bike. Just as it dawned on him that he was all but isolated on the concrete 
trail, the man grabbed his handlebars and hauled him to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a nice bike you got," the man remarked amicably before suggesting that 
Evans let him take it for a test ride. When Evans refused, the man -- young, 
heavyset and nicely dressed -- pulled out a buck knife. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me have this bike," he hissed, "or I'm going to cut you up bad." 
</P>
<P>
Evans -- who complied and who was shaken for months after the robbery last 
summer -- is among a growing number of cyclists who believe that Southern 
California's inner city bike trails have become too dangerous to ride alone. 
</P>
<P>
Early last month, a 46-year-old liquor store clerk pedaling home from work at 
night was shot to death on the Ballona Creek bikeway near Marina del Rey. Los 
Angeles and Culver City police said it was the worst of at least seven attacks 
in the last four months on the trail. The Ballona Creek path has generated so 
many complaints that the Automobile Club of Southern California has for the 
last 18 months warned its cycling members to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclists in San Diego and Ventura County say such incidents are rare along 
their lush bike paths, which for the most part run along the beach or through 
verdant countryside. But along those trails that cut through urban 
neighborhoods, the picture, in some spots, is more menacing. 
</P>
<P>
Harassment, assaults and strong-arm robbery have been reported in recent months 
by cyclists on the San Gabriel River bike trail, the Los Angeles River bike 
trail and Orange County's Santa Ana River bike trail, among others. Parts of 
those trails are idyllic, and police say that for the most part bikers have 
more to fear from potholes and unleashed dogs than they do from muggers and 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, they say, is concentrated along stretches that run past some of 
the most crime-ridden sections of Los Angeles, Pico Rivera, Compton, Lynwood 
and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Here, gang graffiti in lurid reds and blacks cover blocklong stretches of the 
concrete riverbeds. Homeless people camp in the underpasses and behind the 
brittle clumps of brush that flank the trails. In such spots, police say, lone 
riders are isolated and easy prey for highway robbery. Thieves pose as fellow 
bike enthusiasts in need of help, police say, or simply grab cyclists who pedal 
by too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Mar Vista Gardens Housing Projects in Los Angeles, police were warning 
cyclists earlier this year about a gang of urchins who were booby-trapping the 
Ballona Creek path with sticks and little nests of rocks and glass. When a 
cyclist stopped to avoid a blowout, gangs of 13- and 14-year-old boys emerged 
from the brush with baseball bats and 2-by-4s to wrest away bicycles worth 
hundreds, often thousands, of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been real lucky -- I put my head down, look straight ahead and I don't 
look weak," said Ruth Barnes, a past president of the L.A. Wheelmen bicycle 
club and a member of the Los Angeles Bike Advisory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"But there have been knifings, women harassed, and then this murder," Barnes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police caution that the concern about bike path crime may be more a function of 
heightened awareness than anything else. Although statistics are hard to come 
by -- most agencies do not keep a separate accounting of bike-path crime, and 
the paths themselves are split among many jurisdictions -- in general, police 
say, only a handful of crimes are reported each year by people who use the 
riverbed trails. 
</P>
<P>
The recent slaying of John Carl (Jack) Jones of Los Angeles along the Ballona 
Creek bike path was the first murder of a bicyclist in memory for any of the 
three police jurisdictions covering the seven-mile concrete path, and 
authorities noted that Jones, who worked nights, was riding alone about 4:30 
a.m. when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year in the summer, we have problems on the bike path -- robberies, 
assaults, other things," said Los Angeles Police Officer David Martinez, senior 
lead officer for the patrol covering Los Angeles' portion of the Ballona Creek 
path. "It goes in spurts." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, authorities are the last to know. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Jim Moss said the San Gabriel River bike path 
is so tranquil that his deputies in the Pico Rivera substation rarely even 
patrol it. Santa Ana police had a similar impression of the Santa Ana riverbed 
path. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara (Bobbi) Gold, Culver City's newly appointed bike-path safety 
coordinator, said police may be underestimating the problem because much of the 
harassment to cyclists goes unreported. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the victims think it wasn't severe enough, or the police won't do 
anything," she said. "My husband has been bothered twice by aggressive 
panhandlers, and I had a terrible time getting him to report it. All the bike 
stores and bike clubs know about the problems. There have been a lot of things, 
but they're just not getting to the police." 
</P>
<P>
Muriel Scheurman, a Downey bicyclist who rides the San Gabriel River and Rio 
Hondo bike trails, said that earlier this year, a fellow cyclist who was riding 
without a helmet was knocked unconscious when a vandal heaved a bottle at him 
from the top of an overpass. Jim Tatum of Pico Rivera, another regular on the 
San Gabriel River trail, said he has had to dodge rocks from time to time. His 
daughter, Jean Thurmond, said she once encountered a flasher on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
But strong-arm bike theft seems to be the most common form of violence on the 
path, cyclists say. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I hear about is druggies stopping people and saying, 'I want 
your bike, give it to me, thank you,' " said Jerry Woodruff, manager of Downey 
Cyclery in Downey. Woodruff said that at least four people in the last year 
have confided, as they purchased a new bike, that they were replacing one that 
was stolen on the Los Angeles River trail. 
</P>
<P>
Such attacks can be traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Pena, a 24-year-old Anaheim cyclist, is still recovering from an ambush 
in 1985 that occurred near Santa Ana's Centennial Park on the Santa Ana River 
bike path. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through a training ride, Pena stopped for water. As he swung back up on 
his $1,400 Bianchi racing bike, he found himself surrounded by three gaunt, 
unkempt men. One grabbed the handlebars. Another began fingering his pack. 
Tauntingly, they said they were hungry and asked if he had anything to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"I literally reached around, opened my pack and gave them a banana," Pena 
recalled. They burst out laughing and dashed it to the pavement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Pena began to fight, but he was outnumbered and unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy behind me put his left hand on my right shoulder and stuck a gun under 
my rib cage," Pena recalled. "He pulled the trigger. I fell." 
</P>
<P>
Slumping to the ground, Pena watched the gunman scramble onto his bike and flee 
down the path. As the other two took off running, he said, "I heard one say, 
'What the hell did you do that for?' And I realized I was hurt pretty badly, 
because I couldn't feel my right leg at all." 
</P>
<P>
It took a three-week hospital stay, major abdominal surgery and years of 
physical therapy for Pena to recover. "I was 5-10, 185 pounds and 5.5% body fat 
when it happened, and by the time I got out of the hospital, I was a shell," 
Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
He still rides, but only for short stints, because of the pain he still gets in 
his leg and back. His racing bike was never recovered and his attackers were 
never caught.

NEA ADVISORY PANEL OKS GRANTS TO 2 CONTROVERSIAL GALLERIES; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: BUT THE COUNCIL PUTS OFF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TWO PERFORMERS WHO EXPLORE 
SEXUAL TABOOS AND ARE TARGETS OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE OBSCENITY DEBATE.

<P>
The advisory council of the National Endowment for the Arts voted to approve 
$155,000 in grants Saturday to two art galleries that sparked an ongoing 
obscenity debate last year, while postponing a decision on funding for two 
controversial performance artists in a new dispute over conflict of interest by 
NEA grant reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
However, the actions by the National Council on the Arts appeared to have 
fallen far short of the panel's apparent goal of mollifying NEA critics, both 
on the political right and among artists and arts sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Top staff aides to two key conservative congressmen said any benefit was 
effectively offset by a new focus on longstanding problems of conflict of 
interest in NEA grant-making. 
</P>
<P>
Observers from the offices of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and Rep. Dick 
Armey (R-Texas) monitored the NEA meeting throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
The council delayed voting on federal grants for the two New York performance 
artists, Karen Finley and Holly Hughes, until their work is reconsidered by a 
new panel of their peers. The vote to ask the peer panel to reconsider the 
applications was 10 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the council voted to require a brand new grant review for five 
questioned grants, including those for Finley and Hughes. The new review will 
not be completed until November -- long after the final expected vote on NEA 
bills in Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
David Chambers, a Yale School of Drama professor and chairman of the NEA's top 
theater program policy panel, charged that NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer 
wanted to "corral anything that might be construed as controversial." 
</P>
<P>
Council member Harvey Lichtenstein, director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 
delivered an impassioned defense of Finley, a lightning rod of conservative 
criticism. "There is no way that one can comprehend art by reading about it," 
Lichtenstein said of the controversy, which has been fanned by racy 
descriptions of Finley's stage technique in the press. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to experience art is face-to-face," he said. "Yes, she smears 
chocolate on her body. Yes, she puts gelatin in her bra. It was not obscene. It 
was funny. She was professional. She was adept." 
</P>
<P>
Artists and gay rights groups immediately accused the arts agency of 
manufacturing a "bogus" excuse to sidestep funding for Finley and Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
An official of one of the art galleries that received new funding said the 
actions of the NEA advisory board -- on which Frohnmayer has the final say -- 
represented a "mixed message" to artists and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Votes on the grants came during a tumultuous, daylong meeting here in which gay 
rights and arts freedom demonstrators disrupted the gathering, carrying signs 
and chanting: "NEA do your part! We demand more homo art!" 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen demonstrators were removed by police, but no charges were 
filed. About 250 people marched outside. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer had little better luck in keeping peace on the council as factions 
clashed repeatedly. At one point, arts council member Phyllis Berney asked 
Susan Lubowsky, the NEA official explaining one of the grant proposals, "Is 
there an artist in this particular group who will immediately inflame the 
public?" 
</P>
<P>
A flustered Lubowsky answered no, but Frohnmayer disclosed that he had 
personally screened the work of 10 artists to be included in the Awards in the 
Visual Arts show, apparently to make sure the selections were devoid of 
controversial work. 
</P>
<P>
A total of $80,000 went to the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University 
of Pennsylvania, which last year organized a show of work by the late 
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe that resulted in the obscenity prosecution of 
a Cincinnati gallery. The show opened to new controversy in Boston last week. 
</P>
<P>
The vote reversed a decision taken three months ago, in which the council 
withheld the money in an earlier ill-fated attempt to placate congressional 
opponents of the arts agency. The National Council on the Arts has advisory 
power within the arts endowment. Its votes are not binding on Frohnmayer, but 
are almost never set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Another $75,000 was voted for the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in 
Winston-Salem, N.C., for the 1990 edition of an touring art show. Last year's 
show was a center of controversy because it included a photograph of a crucifix 
immersed in urine. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Tannenbaum, assistant director of the Institute for Contemporary Art, 
said the mix of grant votes by the 24-member presidentially appointed arts 
council "leaves it really ambiguous" in terms of what political or artistic 
message -- and to whom -- the NEA was attempting to send. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict-of-interest issue led to the vote to ask a reconsideration of five 
of 52 grants proposed for funding in an NEA program that specializes in 
cutting-edge work. The action had been closely watched because Finley and 
Hughes were recommended for funding despite an earlier move by Frohnmayer to 
cancel grants to the two women and to California performance artists Tim Miller 
and John Fleck. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, The Times reported that the five new grants were involved in a 
conflict-of-interest situation long troublesome to the NEA -- in which grant 
review panel members are simultaneously also applicants for money. Frohnmayer 
acknowledged Friday that the situation needed correction and announced a new 
policy curtailing the practice. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes had been proposed for a $15,000 grant through New York's Downtown Art 
Co. for a production called "No Trace of the Blond," in which grant panel 
member Ellen Sebastian is a collaborator. Finley was involved in a grant under 
which she and musician Jerry Hunt -- a grant panel member -- would create a new 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a lesbian artist who attended Saturday's arts council meeting, 
contended the decision to defer action on grants for her and Finley "is a bogus 
thing. They (Frohnmayer and the NEA) are looking for a reason because they do 
not want to fund openly lesbian, gay art or art that deals with sexual 
politics."

Jurors deliberated four hours without a verdict in Mayor Marion Barry's cocaine 
and perjury trial Saturday and then stopped work for the rest of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deliberations were halted until Monday after the panel asked the judge for 
another look at more than 150 prosecution and defense exhibits in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors introduced more than 100 exhibits and Barry's lawyers more than 60 
during the six-week trial on cocaine and perjury charges. 
</P>
<P>
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson brushed off questions from reporters 
waiting at the courthouse, saying: "Do you people ever feel silly doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
The jurors are sifting through testimony from 44 witnesses, including 10 of 
Barry's friends who said they saw him use cocaine some 200 times dating back to 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
The panel has been told to ignore such factors as the mayor's flamboyant 
personality and his central place in local politics.

The Catholic archdiocese announced Saturday that a priest had offered to resign 
because of a relationship with the same woman whose "intimate" ties with 
Archbishop Eugene Marino forced him to step down last month. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, 27-year-old Vicki R. Long, sued the church for paternity payments 
stemming from her alleged relationship with a third priest. 
</P>
<P>
The church is paying child support, but denies that the priest is the father. 
</P>
<P>
Father Michael Woods, pastor at St. Jude's Catholic Church in Sandy Springs, an 
Atlanta suburb, offered to resign after confessing to an intimate relationship 
with Long, a Riverdale lay minister, said Bishop James Lyke, acting 
administrator of the Atlanta Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the church had accepted Wood's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop said Woods used an undisclosed amount of parish funds to help Long. 
In a statement read to his congregation by an archdiocese spokesman, Woods said 
his relationship with Long has ended.

U.S. DIPLOMAT SEEKS CHINESE COOPERATION 
</P>

<P>
A senior Bush Administration expert on Asia arrived in Beijing on Saturday for 
a hastily arranged visit aimed primarily at seeking Chinese cooperation in an 
international arms embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, also will brief 
Chinese officials about the meeting last week in the Siberian city of Irkutsk 
at which Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze served notice of their desire for unprecedented 
U.S.-Soviet cooperation in Asia, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon's mission indicates that the United States is seeking both to enlist 
China's support against Iraq and, at the same time, to reassure the Chinese 
regime that it need not feel threatened by the closeness with which U.S. and 
Soviet officials are now working together. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are big players, and they ought to be in on these decisions," one 
Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably would have thought about doing this (sending an emissary to 
Beijing) anyway, but (the Iraqi invasion of) Kuwait put it over the edge," the 
official said. "You can't have a situation where you appear to be working only 
with the Soviets. You've got to include China in the action here." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union and France have been Iraq's two leading arms 
suppliers, China also provides significant amounts of arms and military 
equipment to Baghdad. In addition, China is a permanent member of the U.N. 
Security Council, and its cooperation would be necessary to pass any council 
resolution imposing sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Asked two days ago whether China might go along with an arms embargo against 
Iraq, Solomon told The Times, "The Chinese are going to have to decide how 
isolated in the world they want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze told a news conference Friday night in Moscow that the Soviet 
Union had not been in direct contact with China concerning the international 
efforts against Iraq. U.S. officials at the time declined to say whether they 
had talked with Chinese officials, but made clear they expected to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon accompanied Baker during the secretary's just-completed visit to Asia, 
including the meetings in Irkutsk, at which Baker and Shevardnadze spoke of the 
importance of having Washington and Moscow work together in Asia on Cambodia, 
Afghanistan and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, while Baker stopped in Moscow for an emergency meeting on the 
situation in Iraq, Solomon left the secretary's entourage to catch a flight to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon is the highest-ranking Administration official to visit China since 
National Security Adviser Brent A. Scowcroft made two secret trips to Beijing 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Administration still maintains the policy it adopted after 
China's 1989 crushing of its pro-democracy movement. The United States has 
banned "exchanges" with China by any officials at the level of assistant 
secretary or higher. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Administration has explained that it defines exchanges narrowly as 
meaning a reciprocal trading of visits between Beijing and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Administration official said he is quite hopeful that China will 
join the U.S.-Soviet arms embargo and other international efforts against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that the Chinese will be cooperative," he said. "The Chinese 
generally don't like it when one country invades another country. They really 
got mad at us over (the U.S. invasion of) Panama" last December. 
</P>
<P>
However, over the past decade, China has carried out an extremely active effort 
to develop close friendships in the Middle East. A willingness to supply 
low-cost weaponry has been the key ingredient in China's diplomatic effort. 
China made huge arms deliveries to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, U.S. officials have been extremely concerned about 
the possibility that China would supply newly produced M-9 missiles to several 
countries in the Middle East, including Iraq. The missile is still believed to 
be in the development stage.

DEADLY GAME FOR 2 LEADERS; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: HUSSEIN AND BUSH ARE MANEUVERING WITH MILITARY FORCE AND DIPLOMACY -- 
AND THE HEALTH OF THE WORLD ECONOMY IS AT STAKE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, followed now by a direct military threat to Saudi 
Arabia, has become a deadly serious game between two very different world 
leaders -- each maneuvering with military force and diplomacy for stakes that 
could determine the health of the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
For President Bush, dealing with an unpredictable leader under extremely 
adverse circumstances, the challenge is to find a combination of diplomatic, 
economic and military pressures that are sufficient to halt Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein's drive for control of the oil-rich Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The danger, Administration officials acknowledge, is that a misstep could lead 
Hussein to lunge again, creating a situation both more damaging to U.S. 
interests and far harder to rectify. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hussein's) calculation so far has been that he can get away with it," said 
Richard W. Murphy, a former assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern 
affairs. "What we have to do is somehow change that calculation and get it 
across that the costs will be severe." 
</P>
<P>
Potentially more important for the President and his advisers -- accustomed to 
more conventional arithmetic -- the high-stakes calculations are made more 
daunting by deep uncertainty about how Hussein is likely to add things up. 
</P>
<P>
"Warnings to Hussein tend to make him act more truculently," said Graham 
Fuller, a Middle East expert at the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica. "Instead of 
backing down, he reacts with belligerence." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said Saturday that they are particularly concerned 
that Hussein, if he regards his oil routes under threat, will order his army 
into Saudi Arabia to secure a crucial pipeline that delivers Iraqi supplies to 
deep-water ports. 
</P>
<P>
Because such an attack might well propel the United States into war, the 
officials said the Administration has agonized in its efforts to deliver an 
unmistakable threat without delivering an unnecessary provocation. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, one well-placed source said, the Administration has decided for 
the moment not to pursue a strategy that would seek to halt the shipments of 
Iraqi oil through the pipelines in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a Panama, this is not a Grenada, this is not a Tripoli," retired 
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said 
in a television interview. "You cannot assume Iraq will not react to those 
attacks." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the United States and Iraq, one from afar and the other on the 
ground, each took important steps to consolidate its positions and dissuade the 
other from taking further action. 
</P>
<P>
To his earlier pledges of quick withdrawal, Hussein added a chilling caveat: 
Kuwait's new army would essentially become his own. And along the Saudi border, 
he massed a force capable of quickly seizing control of the world's richest oil 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, assembling new punitive sanctions, enlisted the markets of Europe in his 
campaign of economic warfare and further underlined his willingness to use 
American military power if Iraq persists in its march toward the oil fields 
that are crucial to world energy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. military forces are out of geographic reach. They are also in an 
unaccustomed role in such Third World crises: Far from being a joke, Hussein's 
1-million-man army is fully equipped with Soviet and Western armaments, 
including about 5,000 tanks, and battle-hardened after a successful eight-year 
war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, for the present at least, the American side can 
muster mostly a middle-term threat to fend off an imminent Iraqi challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range struggle pits a diplomatic-minded American President in his 
first serious military crisis against a war-scarred Iraqi leader who disdains 
the Western world and has shown no qualms about using misdirection to keep the 
other side off guard. 
</P>
<P>
Just a day after pledging that Iraqi troops would promptly begin withdrawing 
from Kuwait today, Hussein on Saturday dashed international optimism by making 
clear that they would instead don new uniforms and be incorporated into what 
apparently will be a new 100,000-man Kuwaiti army. 
</P>
<P>
Such consolidation of power in Kuwait, a slap to the United States, signaled 
Hussein's firm determination to maintain his war-won dominance over the 
sheikdom and its bountiful reserves, which give the Iraqi leader control over 
one-fifth of the world's supply of oil. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in describing the new army as "all-Arab," the Iraqi leader 
appeared to be invoking a once-powerful pan-Arab ideology in hopes of winning 
greater sympathy from neighbors who might be turned against the West. 
</P>
<P>
Some regional experts said they are concerned that a similar motivation might 
embolden Hussein to launch further military moves, hoping to humiliate the 
United States and expose its impotence in the region before military response 
forces had been put in place. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move would be "very dangerous" for Hussein, said Fuller, the Rand Corp. 
analyst. But he said such a move was increasingly conceivable as part of an 
Iraqi effort to "recover Arab honor and sock it to the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
With Iraqi forces enjoying an overwhelming advantage over Saudi Arabia on the 
scales of military power, the United States -- while rapidly assembling forces 
that might redress the balance -- is seeking in the short run to alter the 
equation with encirclement from afar. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Saturday by the 12-member European Community to halt all oil 
imports from Baghdad gave a boost to the Bush Administration strategy of 
isolation, which has already seen the Soviet Union halt arms sales to its 
former client. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to escalate the punishment -- and persuade Iraq of its limited 
options -- the Administration now hopes to widen the scope of the sanctions, 
seeking stiffer penalties from a wide range of sources, including China and the 
U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Such faith in economic sanctions flies in the face of a history that has 
recorded few successes for them, with enforcers inclined to cheat rather than 
apply the punishment. But Administration officials expressed confidence that 
that rule may be less valid in the post-Cold War world, particularly against a 
nation with as few friends as Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"This appears to be an unprecedented opportunity for true international 
action," one State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under what some believe to be the most likely scenario, if Hussein refrained 
from new military action but refused to loosen his hold on Kuwait, the United 
States and other nations would seek to squeeze Iraq economically while relying 
on its Arab neighbors to negotiate the political solution that no outsider 
could impose. 
</P>
<P>
But such a time-consuming option also could exact severe costs to the United 
States, Administration officials acknowledged. Sources involved in management 
of the crisis said there was considerable concern that a prolonged war of wills 
with Hussein could push the world toward recession, with one outside expert 
predicting that oil could rise to $35 a barrel.

The Soviet Union called on Iraq on Saturday to back up its words with deeds and 
pull its army out of Kuwait as official media heaped scorn on Moscow's former 
ally, accusing Iraq of the same phony justifications the Kremlin once used to 
legitimize the Afghan invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"The moving in of troops 'at the request of' and 'to prevent foreign 
intervention' -- that is quite recent," the daily Rabochaya Tribuna wrote in an 
acid commentary. "We know better than anyone else the pretext used by the Iraqi 
leadership to justify the attack on its neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
In an extraordinary example of the new superpower collaboration, the Soviet 
Union joined with the United States on Friday to call for an international 
weapons embargo against Iraq, a longtime arms customer of the Kremlin and the 
co-signatory of a 1972 treaty of friendship and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
As confusion reigned about Iraq's plans, the Soviet Union made it clear that it 
would be satisfied with nothing less than a withdrawal from Kuwait. A Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, speaking through the official Tass news agency, welcomed 
the Baghdad government's expressed intent to begin the pullout today but said 
words are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"If this encouraging statement is supported by real measures, this would mean 
the start of implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 660 and of 
settlement of the acutest crisis in the Persian Gulf, which has caused worry to 
the entire world," said the spokesman, who was not identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, passed Thursday, calls for an immediate and unconditional 
Iraqi withdrawal. The superpowers joined to demand that Iraq fully obey it. 
</P>
<P>
If there were any doubts after the joint statement issued Friday by Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, 
the escalating language Saturday used by official Moscow-based media showed 
there is no sympathy here for Iraq's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
The government of President Saddam Hussein, once routinely lauded for its 
"peace-loving" policies, was accused by Rabochaya Tribuna, a publication of the 
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, of waging a Wehrmacht-style 
blitzkrieg against a tiny, helpless foe. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of adversary is it whose total forces, including police, are fewer 
than 20,000, whose territory is 25 times smaller than Iraq's and whose 
population is less than half of Baghdad's?" the newspaper's Vladimir Mikhailov 
wrote in indignation. 
</P>
<P>
So closely bound to Moscow that it owed the Soviet Union $6.3 billion for 
foreign assistance at the end of last year, Iraq is now being pilloried in 
Soviet media as an "absolute dictatorship" guilty of massive human rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"President Saddam's coming to power was accompanied by an unprecedented 
campaign to physically annihilate any dissidence, let alone any potential 
shoots of opposition," the Sovietskaya Rossiya daily said. "Thousands of Iraqi 
Communists vanished into the dungeons of the security forces. The northern 
region of Iraq, Kurdistan, was drowned in a sea of blood when government troops 
enforced Baghdad's policy of assimilation of the Kurds." 
</P>
<P>
The language in such commentaries was so harsh that it made it hard to envisage 
renewed cooperation with the Hussein regime on anything approaching the 
pre-invasion scale, although Shevardnadze noted Friday that the Soviet Union is 
keeping its official channels to Baghdad open and sees no merit in breaking 
diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Under Shevardnadze and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has 
publicly broken with many of the foreign policy practices of its past, 
withdrawn its soldiers from Afghanistan and apologized for the 1968 Warsaw Pact 
intervention that snuffed out Czechoslovakia's "Prague spring" turn to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Such revisionism is now being applied to Iraq in the press accounts of last 
week's Kuwait invasion, which tacitly criticize past Soviet indulgence for the 
Hussein government. 
</P>
<P>
"This unprecedented aggression should be regarded as yet another manifestation 
of Baghdad's hegemonist policy in the region, the logic of power pressure and 
rejection of world public opinion," Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist youth 
organization newspaper, said. 
</P>
<P>
A. Shumilin, writing for Komsomolskaya Pravda, one of the Soviet Union's most 
popular dailies, also bared what would be a secret for many of his readers: 
Tanks and airplanes used by the invading Iraqi army were Soviet-made and 
Soviet-supplied. 
</P>
<P>
"It is to be regretted that the Soviet weaponry which comprises the backbone of 
Iraq's armed forces is being used for fanning regional conflicts for the sake 
of satisfying ambitious designs of myopic politicians," Shumilin wrote.

The Egyptian government Saturday canceled leave for its armed forces, ordering 
all officers and soldiers back to their units in response to the Middle East 
crisis sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A defense source said, however, that the forces had not yet been put on alert. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt has one of the largest armies in the region, with 320,000 men under arms. 
Iraq's army is nearly 1 million, the largest in the Middle East.

TRINIDAD'S LEADER DESCRIBES ORDEAL AS HOSTAGE;

REBELLION: HE SAYS MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS ATTEMPTING A COUP SHOT HIM AS HE LAY 
ON THE FLOOR OF PARLIAMENT.

<P>
A battered and bruised Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson made his first public 
appearance in a television interview broadcast Saturday and said that radical 
Muslim rebels who staged a coup attempt shot him as he lay on his stomach in 
the Parliament building calling for Trinidad forces to attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouted, 'Murderers! Torturers!' and I called upon the forces outside to 
attack with full force," he said in the interview taped Friday from his 
hospital bed. "And then it was while I was lying on my face, I was shot in the 
leg." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was wounded a week ago Friday after the Muslim fundamentalist rebels 
led by Yasin abu Bakr stormed the country's Parliament and state television 
station, taking more than 45 hostages in a bloody, five-day standoff. It ended 
Wednesday with the hostages' release and the rebels' unconditional surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Looking tired and shaken and with bruises on his face, Robinson, 63, called on 
Trinidadians to keep the faith and thanked the nation and foreign heads of 
state who had expressed their solidarity and offered support. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in good shape now," Robinson said. "I know it has been a trying period, 
and even if we who were in the Red House (Parliament) were in pain, in my mind 
the welfare of the country was foremost." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson condemned the rebellion, saying the coup attempt was not a popular 
uprising and that he felt relief that the people rallied behind the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The violent attack on Parliament is something absolutely new in our experience 
and in our view should never be allowed to happen again," he said. "It was a 
violation of every code in civilized society and a throwback of 300 years." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson described the treatment he and about 17 other ministers and 
legislators received during the 91-hour stretch as hostages, saying he had no 
choice but to at least pretend to cooperate with rebel demands. 
</P>
<P>
"We were humiliated, roughed-up, and we suffered extremely excruciating pain. I 
called on the forces outside to attack with all their resources, and that was 
when I was shot in the leg," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, army troops and police searched the island, tracking down holdouts 
from the Muslim group, uncovering weapons and killing the rebel leader's 
stepson in the mop-up operation. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. David Williams, an army spokesman, said his troops found eight bodies 
Friday in the Parliament building and collected 93 weapons in a sweep through 
the compound where the Muslim rebels lived. 
</P>
<P>
He also reported the death of Njassane Omuaali, 21, stepson of rebel leader Abu 
Bakr and a student at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Williams reported 
that Omuaali, who was on summer vacation in Trinidad, was killed in a gun 
battle with police who found him in the town of Curepe, five miles east of Port 
of Spain, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the coup attempt sparked violence and widespread looting 
and destruction in the capital, claiming at least 30 lives and causing millions 
of dollars worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, it was reported that more than 300 died and about 1,000 were 
injured in the failed coup. 
</P>
<P>
The island continued to stagger Saturday from the aftereffects of the crisis. 
Food and gasoline remained scarce, and long lines formed outside grocery 
stores. Most supermarkets and banks remained closed.

GALVESTON BAY REOPENED TO FISHING A WEEK AFTER OIL SPILL

<P>
Galveston Bay reopened to fishing Saturday, a week after a tanker-barge 
collision in the environmentally sensitive waterway that authorities now 
concede spilled far more oil than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
The state health department declared the entire bay open for taking of fin fish 
but, concerned about the continuing effects of the spill, maintained a ban on 
shellfish harvesting across much of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
When salvage crews lifted one of the two barges damaged in the collision out of 
the bay, they found virtually no oil on board, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer 
Todd Nelson said. That led to an increase in the estimate of the amount spilled 
from 500,000 gallons to more than 700,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
In Beaumont, Tex., two lawsuits were filed on behalf of hundreds of people who 
say their livelihoods have suffered because of the July 28 spill in Galveston 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Both class-action lawsuits name Apex RE&amp;T Inc., owner of the barges, and 
Eletson Corp., owner of the tanker, as defendants. The suits seek monetary 
awards for each fisherman expected to lose money because of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
A helicopter flyover Saturday morning found that southerly winds had pushed the 
oil north onto beaches around the Houston Point marshlands, Nelson said. At 
least 120 contract workers and 30 Coast Guard employees worked to clean that 
area, as well as beaches at Redfish Island.

BUDGET TALKS SHOW LITTLE PROGRESS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: BOTH SIDES BLAME EACH OTHER FOR THE LACK OF GAINS IN THREE MONTHS OF 
NEGOTIATIONS. AND NOW, CONGRESS IS OFF ON ITS AUGUST BREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's high-stakes campaign to reach a budget compromise with 
Democratic leaders has been suspended for Congress' August break, with little 
to show for three months of talks besides political scars on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia contends the budget talks have 
virtually collapsed -- and he blames the Democrats for it. Democrats say 
divisions among Republicans are the primary cause of the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fiddling around while Rome burns," Rep. Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.), one 
of the negotiators, cried in despair over the lack of any real progress in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Even last week's invasion of Kuwait by Iraq may have set back the 
deficit-reduction process -- by making it more difficult for negotiators to 
count on deep cuts in defense spending or to raise taxes on gasoline, 
particularly if oil prices begin to spiral. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, both the President and key Democratic leaders have refrained from 
declaring the summit sessions a failure, holding out hope even in this election 
year that an elusive, bipartisan deficit-cutting accord can be achieved in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: The most likely alternative -- automatic federal spending cuts of 
$100 billion or more that would slash some federal programs by as much as 40% 
on Oct. 1 -- is considered too horrible to contemplate by the Administration 
and congressional negotiators alike. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to keep hope alive, the bipartisan congressional leaders and Bush agreed 
to set a Sept. 10 deadline for agreement and a speedy timetable for approval of 
a package that would reduce the deficit by $50 billion in the coming fiscal 
year and by an unprecedented five-year cut of $500 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the lack of progress, Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) summed up the 
situation: "We're designing a honeymoon cottage. Unfortunately, the girl hasn't 
said 'yes' yet, so we've got a way to go." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the results offer little basis for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
One factor behind the inability to reach an accord is the widespread public 
apathy over the deficit -- even though the red-ink figure has climbed from $100 
billion last January to $169 billion in mid-July, without including the cost of 
the massive savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
While opinion surveys show some signs of rising public concern, the shift has 
not been enough to galvanize members of Congress into taking the kind of tough 
action that is needed -- such as raising taxes or cutting pet spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
And there has been no domestic or foreign shock to jolt the lawmakers into 
casting their reticence aside. "There is no sense of crisis in the land," said 
Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.), one of the negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, when Bush convened the budget summit and hinted that he might support 
some limited tax increases, Democrats urged him to go on nationwide television 
to outline the gravity of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
But the President declined, insisting that he would address the nation only 
when he could endorse a bipartisan agreement to narrow the budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
Key Democrats contend that without jawboning from the White House to intensify 
pressure on Congress, there is no way they could persuade a majority of 
lawmakers in the House and Senate to support them. Only the President can lead 
on the issue, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's advisers, however, are worried that he will receive the political blame 
if he becomes identified with painful solutions while the Democrats keep their 
distance on taxes and program cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The President also is faced with a sizzling revolt in his own ranks after his 
decision to reverse himself and declare that some tax increases might be needed 
to tackle the budget dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bush has remained ambivalent. In Washington, he meets regularly 
with Democratic leaders and seeks their cooperation. On the campaign trail -- 
in order to keep his conservative followers happy -- he has blasted the 
Democrats as big spenders. 
</P>
<P>
But the Democrats also have been schizophrenic. While some of their 
negotiators, such as House Budget Committee Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel 
Valley), have been eager to engage the Republicans by offering their own budget 
plan, Senate Democrats generally have played a waiting game, expecting to 
improve their bargaining position through delays. 
</P>
<P>
Still others, such as Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.), chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, and his House counterpart, Rep. Jamie L. Whitten 
(D-Miss.), seem concerned primarily with holding onto their turf -- and are 
resisting major spending cuts or changes in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) is reported to be the chief 
proponent of a hang-tough posture in the closed-door negotiations, a stand that 
often is echoed publicly by Fowler and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim 
Sasser (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's reasoning is that the growing size of the deficit, together with 
fast-rising estimates for resolving the S&amp;L crisis, will put added pressure 
on Bush and his Republicans to offer the Democrats a better deal on tax 
increases and other parts of a budget package. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Panetta has been urging Democrats to start putting "real numbers" 
on the bargaining table as the only way to get practical results from the 
stalled negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But once the Republicans leaked details of their latest proposal -- which 
called for highly unpopular increases in beer, wine and liquor taxes -- Panetta 
had second thoughts about advancing a high-risk plan of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not pledge that every time the Republicans slit their wrists, we'll 
slit ours," he said. Democrats also feared that any proposal they made before 
the current recess would be picked apart by special-interest groups before 
negotiators could defend their plan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the schism in GOP ranks -- and the Democrats' inability to agree even 
on an opening counteroffer -- negotiators on both sides remain confident that 
it will not take them long to find a way to reach an accord once they achieve 
the political will. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has suggested shifting the summit talks in late August or early September 
to his tranquil hideaway at Camp David, Md., the same spot that former 
President Jimmy Carter took the leaders of Israel and Egypt to make peace, to 
encourage domestic harmony on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), one of the key players in the talks, 
has endorsed the idea, and last week Foley renewed his expressions of optimism 
that the two sides will be able to reach an agreement in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
To Foley, the real deadline for any accord will be Oct. 1 -- the day that the 
automatic spending cuts mandated under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law 
would take effect if there is no agreement on how to trim the deficit more 
gradually. 
</P>
<P>
If no deal is possible, however, Congress and the President may finesse the 
issue this year by revamping the deficit targets and again deferring the 
deadline for balancing the budget -- in essence a political cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
Foley already has hinted that Congress might postpone the Gramm-Rudman deadline 
for a month if the negotiators seemed to be making progress. 
</P>
<P>
His Republican counterpart, House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois, 
agrees that only the threat of an imminent deadline will get Congress moving. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get a lot of members' attention around here until you're on the 
precipice," Michel said.

Commercial salmon fishermen off the Central California coast may face lean 
years beginning in 1991 when the fish feel the full impact of the drought, a 
state Department of Fish and Game scientist said. "It looks like an unhappy 
coincidence of factors down the road," said Alan Baracco, a marine biologist 
for the department's ocean salmon project at Rancho Cordova near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon caught off Central California spawn in the Sacramento and San Joaquin 
River watersheds, where breeding conditions are deteriorating because of low 
stream flows and warm water. In 1988, ocean fishermen unloaded a record 9.6 
million pounds of salmon at San Francisco, Monterey and smaller harbors in the 
region. The catch declined to 3.7 million pounds in 1989, and probably will be 
about the same in 1990, Baracco said.

While federal agents prowled remote mountain areas on a sweep to uproot 
marijuana, local authorities were forced to send their eradication teams home 
because of funding problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mendocino County is disbanding its marijuana team today because the state has 
not renewed its funding. The sheriffs of Trinity and Humboldt counties plan to 
dissolve their teams unless they get state help. State and federal agents last 
weekend began "Operation Green Sweep," which they said was the largest 
anti-marijuana operation ever conducted on public land. Since 1984, the state 
has provided the three counties with money to patrol the mountains and yank the 
illegal plants, valued at up to $3,000 each. Last year the counties received a 
total of $2.2 million.

LATINO LEADER SAYS COUNTY FACES PRESSURE TO REDISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success of a historic voting rights lawsuit in Los Angeles County has 
placed local government officials under the gun to consider redistricting plans 
in Ventura County, a Latino rights advocate said in Ventura on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Every county is now vulnerable to these kind of lawsuits," Richard Martinez, 
executive director of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, told 
a group of about 50 local Latino politicians and activists. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a federal judge approved a reapportionment plan for the Los Angeles 
Board of Supervisors, which Martinez said sets an important precedent and opens 
a window of opportunity for Latinos in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is designed to help the first Latino win a seat on the powerful board. 
</P>
<P>
"For counties like Ventura this means that for redistricting in 1991 they are 
going to be under the gun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no voting rights lawsuit has been filed in Ventura County, Martinez, 
whose agency oversees voter registration efforts in 13 western states, said it 
is only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is who will exercise the political leadership of the Latino 
community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was the keynote speaker at Ventura College for the "Latino Political 
Empowerment Voter Registration and Redistricting Conference." The conference 
was attended by Latino council members, city officials and congressional 
candidates from Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
The conference -- the first of its kind in Ventura County -- was part of a 
statewide effort by a coalition of organizations to increase Latino political 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
It was sponsored by organizations such as Latinos for Fair Representation, the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the National Assn. of 
Latino Elected Officials. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez criticized at-large elections in cities such as Oxnard, where more 
than half of the population is Latino but only three Latinos have ever been 
elected to the City Council. One Latino, Manuel Lopez, sits on the five-member 
council now. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said 27% of California's population is Latino, yet only 5% of all the 
state's elected politicians in federal, state and local offices are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he foresees a voting rights lawsuit in Ventura County initially 
targeting a small school district where boundaries dilute the voting power of 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The success of such a suit could pressure larger government agencies, such as 
the county, to voluntarily consider redistricting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Los Angeles County spent more than $3 million to fight the 
redistricting lawsuit. Martinez guessed that county officials working with 
tight budgets might be reluctant to fight such a suit. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Herrera, an aide to Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, said an 
immediate step toward achieving fair minority representation is increased voter 
registration. However, he acknowledged that getting residents to register to 
vote is difficult and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is the first step in a long journey we have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Antonio Abarca, an attorney for the California Rural Legal Assistance 
office in Oxnard, outlined the conditions that he believes are necessary to win 
a redistricting lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
He said such a lawsuit will be most successful if the city, county or district 
has a cohesive Latino population, a geographic concentration of Latino voters 
and a history of ethnic discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to build this evidentiary base first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez noted that Ventura County residents have one of the highest participation 
rates in the country for responding to the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
He said the census results will be vital to a redistricting effort because the 
census will give an up-to-date record of the number of Latinos living in the 
area.

THE ABORTION BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: FEMALE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN VENTURA COUNTY ARE FOCUSING ON A 
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION AS A MAJOR THEME IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the first general election campaign since the U.". Supreme Court revived the 
abortion debate last summer, female Democratic candidates are asking voters to 
elect them as guardians of a woman's right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Ginny Connell, a former Catholic nun, decided to run against Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) out of frustration over his antiabortion votes and 
rough treatment of those who disagree with him. Although she retains deep 
Christian beliefs, Connell said preserving abortion rights is her No. 1 issue. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Perez Ferguson is challenging Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) with 
the rallying cry that the veteran congressman is "standing in the way of 
exercising our rights and trying to take away our reproductive freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The two Democrats, both taking on entrenched incumbents, are hoping that their 
campaigns will get boosts from a fellow abortion-rights advocate leading the 
Democratic ticket in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, who is matched against Republican nominee Pete Wilson in the 
gubernatorial race, suggests in her speeches that the only way to ensure 
abortion rights in California is to elect her as governor. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates who support abortion rights are counting on the upcoming nomination 
hearings of U.". Supreme Court justice nominee David Souter to keep the 
abortion issue fresh in the minds of the voters. The hearings are expected to 
begin shortly after the Senate returns from recess on Sept. 10, less than two 
months before the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortion will be in the news no matter what we do," said Dee Dee Myers, a 
spokeswoman for the Feinstein campaign. "Abortion is going to be an important 
issue in the campaign, not because candidates are making it an issue, but 
because people care about it." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the U.". Supreme Court upheld a Missouri law that bans abortions 
in public hospitals and forbids public employees from assisting in abortions. 
The Webster decision opened the door for other states to place restrictions on 
abortion for the first time since 1973, when the court stopped states from 
regulating abortion with its Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
That shift intensified interest in legislative races and awakened 
abortion-rights activists who had seen little need for political activity to 
match the increasingly visible antiabortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, for instance, the California Abortion Rights Action League 
has seen its annual donations double to $500,000 and its membership quadruple 
to 50,000, said Robin Schneider, CARAL's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider suggests that renewed concern over abortion rights can translate into 
votes in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think abortion is a miracle issue," Schneider said. "But it can take a 
campaign that is a little bit of a long shot and make it competitive." 
</P>
<P>
As proof, she cites two long-shot female candidates who overcame antiabortion 
competitors in special elections to win legislative seats shortly after the 
July 3, 1989, Webster decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the most widely publicized case, Democrat Lucy Killea of San Diego won a 
special election in a Republican-dominated state Senate district after Catholic 
Bishop Leo T. Maher banned her from receiving Communion because of her advocacy 
of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ferguson and Connell hope that the abortion rights fervor that ignited 
Killea's supporters will spark their own campaigns. "It is still very much an 
issue," Killea said. "Certainly with women, it is not just a philosophical 
issue, it is a personal issue as well." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Johnston, director of the National Right to Life Committee's Western 
region, disagrees that voter sympathies have swung toward supporters of 
abortion rights. He lists a string of defeats for abortion-rights advocates in 
the June primary that shows favoring legal abortion does not necessarily 
enhance a candidate's chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
"Ferguson and Connell will be another demonstration that being pro-abortion 
isn't a boot up," Johnston said. "I'm not writing off those races, but I think 
Anita Ferguson and Robin Schneider are blowing smoke to try to create an image 
of a stampede that isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said that if needed, he will unleash his group's full arsenal of 
political weapons -- including direct-mail brochures, volunteers walking 
precincts, and phone banks -- to protect antiabortion incumbents Lagomarsino 
and McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
"Lagomarsino has carried water for us," Johnston said. "I've known Tom since 
1985, and he's voted with us consistently." 
</P>
<P>
In the congressional and Assembly race, the views of all four candidates spring 
from deeply rooted beliefs, albeit from widely different perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock, whose Assembly district stretches from Ventura to Thousand Oaks, is 
well-known for his opposition to public financing of family-planning clinics 
that perform abortions. Unlike some who oppose abortion on moral grounds, his 
position stems from the same fiscal conservative zeal that motivates him to 
protest tax increases and government spending. 
</P>
<P>
Although McClintock opposes abortion, he said he does not favor an outright ban 
on the procedure because it would drive the practice underground. But he 
vehemently opposes state financing of "wholesale abortions on demand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain things the government should not promote, and abortion is 
one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ginny Connell, a former nun who now is a licensed marriage and family 
counselor, decided to run against McClintock after she was nearly forcibly 
ejected from his office building while trying to persuade him to alter his 
voting pattern. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 17, 1989, Connell was one of the speakers at a news conference outside 
McClintock's office in Camarillo, designed to pressure the assemblyman to vote 
to restore cuts in the state budget for family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock declined an invitation to present his views at the news conference, 
and his staff asked building security officials to remove the assembled group 
from the premises, Connell and other organizers said. Failing to break up the 
gathering, security personnel called the police, who arrived just as the group 
was dispersing. There were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock denies that either he or his staff tried to squelch the news 
conference. "It was an action by the building superintendent without the 
knowledge of our office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Connell and other organizers do not believe him. "That was a very big part 
of my decision to run," Connell said. "That was a very strong experience of how 
extreme his position was . . . how his kind of representation was very 
unacceptable, very narrow and very dangerous to women." 
</P>
<P>
Connell said she did not give abortion much thought during the 1960s when she 
was a nun teaching inner-city school children in Brooklyn, N.Y. It wasn't until 
after she left the order that she formulated her views, largely in response to 
the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
"It became something I felt very strongly," Connell said. "Neither the church 
nor the government should make that decision for a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Although Connell spent 10 years as a nun and considers herself Christian in 
philosophy, she is no longer a practicing Catholic. After leaving to attend 
postgraduate school, she married Phillip Connell, a former priest. 
</P>
<P>
Marrying a priest is grounds for excommunication, and the Connells decided to 
leave the church voluntarily instead of forcing the issue. They are both 
licensed counselors living in Thousand Oaks with two teen-age sons. 
</P>
<P>
In the 19th Congressional District that straddles Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties, both candidates share Catholic upbringings even though they split on 
the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino refused to be interviewed for this article. But John Doherty, his 
spokesman, said the congressman remains steadfast in his opposition to abortion 
and to government funding of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Doherty said Lagomarsino supports amending the Constitution to outlaw abortion. 
He also believes that parental consent should be required for juveniles seeking 
abortions and that physicians should be criminally prosecuted for performing 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to have any effect on his campaign because his views are the 
way they always have been, and he's not going to change," Doherty said. "He 
sees no point in talking to you." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was raised Catholic, Ferguson said her position in support of 
abortion rights began to form when she was growing up in Montebello and one of 
her best friends in sixth grade became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"She was in my Girl Scout troop, and her mother was one of the co-leaders of 
the troop," Ferguson said. "She was a member of my church. It was a good family 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
At age 12, Ferguson said she suddenly realized, "Life was not a 'Father Knows 
Best' TV serial. It has adult problems that need adult information. You made 
tough choices and stuck with them." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said working with programs that cater to pregnant teen-agers and 
victims of rape and incest has strengthened her resolve to protect abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"When you meet these girls face to face, you realize that they are just like 
your sister, your neighbor. They need to have the opportunity to understand 
what abortion is about and make that decision with their families." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson believes that her views are more in step with those of the voters. She 
backs up her assertion with a June 21-23 survey of registered voters in Santa 
Barbara and Ventura counties that showed 64% consider themselves "pro-choice" 
rather than "pro-life." 
</P>
<P>
The polling firm, paid by her campaign, singles out the abortion issue as the 
most important to the success of her campaign. In a poll with a margin of error 
of 5%, nearly half of voters surveyed agreed that they would "vote against a 
member of Congress solely if he opposed a woman's right to have an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the Ferguson campaign, the firm wrote, "Most importantly, fully 71 
percent of voters did not know that Rep. Lagomarsino is anti-choice. Ferguson's 
support can only grow if her campaign is able to educate voters about 
respective positions on this crucial issue." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has tried to hammer Lagomarsino on the issue, but her campaign lacks 
money needed to broadcast her message on television, radio, newspapers or 
through direct mailings. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the California Abortions Right Action League is planning to help 
abortion-rights candidates by lining up volunteers to get out the vote and mail 
slate cards listing candidates espousing their views. 
</P>
<P>
In a massive statewide effort, the league is calling every woman registered to 
vote who is between the ages of 25 and 45, to recruit those who are 
abortion-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"Those names will be available to pro-choice candidates such as Anita Perez 
Ferguson and Ginny Connell," Schneider said. "We are going to make sure that 
they vote and that they know who the pro-choice candidates are."

LAND DEAL BY LINDSAY AIDE UNDER INVESTIGATION; 
</P>
<P>
PROBE: DEPUTY SAL ALTAMIRANO ALLEGEDLY ORCHESTRATED A HOUSING CONTRACT TO A 
DEVELOPMENT TEAM HE HAD ASSEMBLED BEHIND THE SCENES. HE DENIES ANY WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office is investigating whether a top aide to 
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay improperly influenced the award and subsequent 
cancellation of a proposed contract to build senior citizen apartments on city 
land later sold to a fund-raiser for Mayor Tom Bradley for a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the probe is Lindsay's longtime deputy Sal Altamirano. According 
to information provided to the district attorney by city officials, Altamirano 
allegedly orchestrated the housing contract award to a development team he had 
assembled behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the developers was Edward C. Reyes, an Altamirano friend since junior 
high school. Another was Dynamic Builders Inc., a major political contributor 
in the city. A third was Arturo Ramos, a former member of the singing group the 
Ink Spots, who alleges that Altamirano killed the senior housing project in 
1986 during a dispute over its control. 
</P>
<P>
Public records show that less than one month after Ramos and Reyes formed 
Central City Planning and Development Corp., Altamirano paved the way for the 
development of low- and moderate-income senior citizen apartments on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as part of a two-man committee evaluating development proposals, 
Altamirano recommended that the City Council sell the land to his friend's 
corporation over four competitors. Inexplicably, papers ranking the competing 
proposals were not filled out, according to documents on file in the city's 
Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with The Times, Altamirano offered contradictory accounts of his 
role in the matter, but insisted that he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that his efforts to sell the city land began after a discussion 
with Ramos and Reyes, but said their proposal to build 100 senior citizen 
apartments was selected on its merits. It was the only development plan, he 
said, that did not request taxpayer subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to say that I was never promised anything (by the development team), I 
wasn't paid anything," Altamirano volunteered. "My only intent was to build 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that "in hindsight," he probably should have withdrawn from the 
selection committee because of his 30-year friendship with Reyes and a possible 
appearance of favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
Altamirano insisted that it was not his fault that much-needed senior citizen 
housing was not built on the city-owned lots, located south of downtown in an 
impoverished area of Lindsay's district. He said the housing probably would 
have been built by a developer if the land had not been sold to mayoral 
fund-raiser Allen E. Alevy and his wife for the expansion of their adjacent 
mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason the project died," Altamirano said, "was because the Alevys wanted 
to buy the property. Simple as that. . . . I assume the mayor talked to the 
councilman because he (Lindsay) told me to sell the property to the Alevys." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay said he stands behind his deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever he has done, right or wrong, he was carrying out my request or 
order," Lindsay declared. "He's as honest as the day is long." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay also said he does not regret his involvement in helping Alevy buy land 
that had been slated for senior housing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my district," he said, "and I'll do what I want to do. And the people 
keep reelecting me. . . . I got senior housing all over my district." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the controversy surrounding the two long, narrow dirt lots on Martin 
Luther King Jr. Boulevard has centered on the mayor's attempts in 1987 and 1988 
to help Alevy buy them without a public auction. At the time, Alevy was 
organizing a series of fund-raising carnivals that generated at least $80,000 
for the mayor's reelection drive. 
</P>
<P>
Alevy was allowed to purchase one 41,720-square-foot property without 
competitive bids, but was denied the second neighboring parcel when the city 
administrative office said it should be auctioned off to ensure that taxpayers 
received top dollar. Bradley has said that he did no more for Alevy than he 
does for any of his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, a story in The Times about the Bradley-Alevy connection prompted a 
city audit of the unusual land transactions. It was during this review that the 
allegations surrounding Lindsay's office surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
The city audit report, released two weeks ago, made only passing reference to 
the referral of information to the district attorney's office, saying it 
concerned events "which may have caused cancellation of the housing project." 
The district attorney's office has refused to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has learned that the allegations against Altamirano came chiefly from 
the development team's president, Ramos, during questioning by city auditors. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what happened during the approval and subsequent death of the 
housing venture because the key participants contradicted each other -- and 
sometimes themselves -- in interviews with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Public records make at least one thing clear: Altamirano abruptly derailed the 
housing development that he helped initiate. As a result, the mayor's political 
ally was able to buy the land for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, whose account triggered the district attorney's investigation, said that 
he told Altamirano in early 1985 that he wanted to build a senior citizen 
apartment complex on the property. Ramos said the council aide liked the idea 
and suggested that he include their mutual friend Reyes in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he figured, "Maybe if I scratch his (Altamirano's) back, he'll 
scratch mine." 
</P>
<P>
Altamirano also requested that Ramos use a particular construction contractor, 
telling him that "the councilman would like you to use Dynamic Builders," 
according to Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
"Far be it from me," Ramos said, "to do something against the councilman's 
wishes." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos' team and four other companies eventually responded to the city's 
published request for proposals to build apartments for seniors on the 
property. As Lindsay's representative on a two-member selection committee, 
Altamirano and a top housing official picked Ramos' team, a choice later 
routinely endorsed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Neither man could explain why their evaluation sheets in city files were not 
filled out. Both insisted that Ramos' Central City firm was the clear choice 
because it alone asked for no city subsidies. As the project moved forward, 
Ramos said, Altamirano pressured him to relinquish more control to Reyes, with 
whom the council aide grew up and served in the Navy. In response, Ramos said 
he gave his power of attorney to Reyes so that he could run day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that when he later questioned how the project was being run, 
Altamirano and Reyes tried to push him further out. 
</P>
<P>
He said Reyes warned him that, "If you release yourself as president, this 
thing will go ahead smoothly. Otherwise, you're not going to have a project." 
He said Altamirano also told him to "move out of the way because we can't trust 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Refusing, Ramos said he canceled the power of attorney to Reyes and scouted for 
new financing. City records show that until that point in mid-April of 1986, 
the project was racing through the City Hall bureaucracy. The only remaining 
obstacle was passage of a City Council ordinance transferring title of the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
But records show that after the power of attorney was canceled, Altamirano 
blocked the project by directing that the paperwork be sent back to Lindsay's 
office, where it remained indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reyes and Dynamic Builders pulled out of the project, leaving Ramos 
with no contractor, architect or financing. Undeterred, Ramos informed city 
housing officials in a November, 1986, letter that he had assembled another 
team. When he didn't hear back, Ramos said he went to Altamirano. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the mayor has decided to give the land to some person who owns a liquor 
store," he quoted Altamirano as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Sal, that doesn't make any sense. That was needed housing. That 
doesn't make sense coming from Tom Bradley.' He said, 'If I were you, I'd leave 
it alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
With that, Ramos said, he abandoned his efforts, contending that the project 
died because he refused to be "a puppet." 
</P>
<P>
In two interviews, Altamirano offered directly conflicting versions of his role 
in the housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
He first acknowledged suggesting that Ramos and Reyes team up. "I said, 'Why 
don't you submit a proposal?' And they did. But (it) had to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Altamirano minimized his participation on the two-man selection committee, 
saying: "I really didn't make the selection. I wasn't pushing them (Central 
City)." He said the other member, ex-housing Director Craig Avery of the 
Community Development Department, decided it was the best proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Avery, when contacted by The Times, said he had no comment on the council 
deputy's recollections or role in the selection. 
</P>
<P>
Altamirano also denied that he told Ramos to use Dynamic Builders. "I think 
Ramos asked who the best builder in town was, who does the most building 
downtown," Altamirano said. "I told him Dynamic Builders." 
</P>
<P>
He said he sidetracked Central City's proposal because there were financing 
problems and Ramos was trying to sell the project out from under his partners. 
It was around this time, Altamirano added, that "the Alevys surfaced." 
</P>
<P>
The day after his first interview, Altamirano telephoned The Times, saying 
Reyes had refreshed his memory and that his earlier comments were "incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
Altamirano said he did not recommend that Reyes and Ramos submit a housing 
proposal. He said the two men had approached him with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he never mentioned Dynamic Builders as a possible developer. It 
was Reyes, he said, who was entirely responsible for bringing Dynamic into the 
deal. "I was talking off the top of my head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, now a grading inspector in the city's building and safety department, 
said that he recommended Dynamic Builders because he had worked there and knew 
company President Ramon Bonin. Without Dynamic, Reyes said, Ramos would not 
have been able to finance the development. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that Dynamic and he abandoned the venture solely because Ramos had 
been dealing behind their backs. "Art (Ramos) was trying to ace everybody out," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamic's Bonin did not return phone calls by The Times. Since 1984, his 
company and its employees have contributed nearly $150,000 to the campaigns of 
various city politicians, most of it to Bradley. Lindsay has received $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, the dispute between the players delayed construction to a 
point where city housing Director Ralph Esparza said he believed senior housing 
was no longer feasible. Changes in federal tax laws, he explained, had reduced 
government rent subsidies for such developments. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to city real estate officials, Esparza said the land was no longer 
suitable for a residential project and should "be given full consideration for 
commercial development." 
</P>
<P>
Esparza said that although he had reached this conclusion independently, he 
wrote the memo after a call from the mayor inquiring about "the status" of the 
land that Alevy later bought. 
</P>
<P>
Alevy has yet to break ground on the site.

DECLINE OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ACCELERATES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S PROBLEMS STARTED LONG BEFORE MASSIVE CUTS IN THE 
NEW STATE BUDGET. PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE ARE FRIGHTENING, EXPERTS WARN.

<P>
In about three weeks, Los Angeles County's mental health system will start 
self-destructing. Many county clinics will be closed, already overcrowded 
psychiatric emergency rooms will be deluged and up to 26,000 severely disturbed 
patients will be stranded, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the crisis facing the county's most psychotic and suicidal citizens didn't 
start last week when massive mental-health cuts in the state's new budget 
prompted the county's mental health director to declare a "state of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
The system started eroding in the 1970s, but for many it only became tangible 
last year. After blaming their problems on another year of meager state 
funding, county officials closed five of 28 clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences came swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, for instance, physicians at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center have released hallucinating patients if they do not appear to be 
suicidal to free scarce beds, according to Dr. Anna Smith, vice chairwoman of 
the hospital's department of psychiatry, who compares the practice to "playing 
Russian roulette." 
</P>
<P>
With psychiatric admissions up 43% since April, 1989, severely mentally ill 
patients sometimes sit two or three days in a waiting room before a bed is 
free. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened since the summer of 1989, mental health activists warned, is 
only a precursor to what can be expected in the coming months. And, they said, 
it frightens them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to grapple with the enormity of the problem," said Ann Brand, 
president of the Assn. of Community Mental Health Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
With no place else to turn, many disturbed people have ended up at County-USC 
Medical Center shackled to their beds with leather restraints. In recent 
months, 30 to 60 patients a day could be found tied to their beds, said many 
psychiatrists. They are sharing rooms with cancer patients, heart attack 
victims and others in the medical wards because the 116 beds in the locked 
psychiatric wards -- where shackles are not needed -- are filled. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous psychiatrists, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal, 
told The Times similar stories: 
</P>
<P>
Some County-USC patients have laid on urine-soaked sheets and waited three or 
four days to see one of the psychiatrists, who said they are overwhelmed with 
the crush of suicidal and psychotic people. Frightened or angry patients 
sometimes cut or bruise their limbs trying to escape from restraints. One man 
in his early 20s recently managed to free himself and was found standing on a 
13th-floor ledge talking to God. He was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
"You've heard of animal rights? You can't put makeup on a rat and yet you can 
let someone sit in their own urine for many hours because there is no one there 
to take care of them. That doesn't seem right to me," said Dr. Nick Dewan, who 
until recently worked as a psychiatrist at County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cordova, County-USC administrator, disputed that any mental patients 
are being neglected. He said that up to 75% of the psychiatric patients 
shackled to beds in the medical wings are there because they are physically 
sick and not because the psychiatric wards are filled. 
</P>
<P>
The dimensions of the suffering, said Dr. Milton Miller, chairman of the 
psychiatry department at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, "deadens people's sense of 
the horror. When you take away one person's doctor and he dies . . . you can 
encompass it in your mind. When you get to talking about 5,000 people, 10,000, 
20,000, it's hard for people . . . to encompass what that means." 
</P>
<P>
The current crisis was precipitated when Gov. George Deukmejian's budget cuts 
resulted in a deficit of up to $45 million for the county's mental health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
After last year's closures, some patients waited three or four months to see a 
psychiatrist at county-supported clinics. About 8,000 patients couldn't get any 
appointments. Calling it a "wrenching, wrenching experience," Ford Kuramoto, 
who resigned as district chief of the Hollywood clinic in March, said many 
patients "begged and cried" when told they were no longer welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Some centers remained open with skeleton crews after massive layoffs and 
resignations. Last summer, there were 358 fewer doctors, nurses and other 
personnel on the payroll than two years before when there were 1,763 health 
workers. Many more have left since then. Under these conditions, physicians 
have relied more heavily on drugs to control patients, according to clinic 
administrators and psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
With treatment at the clinics no longer guaranteed, more mentally ill grew 
sicker, concluded Dr. Smith and numerous other physicians. 
</P>
<P>
A sicker population has placed a greater burden on the county's four 
psychiatric emergency rooms, which are expected to treat the uninsured mentally 
ill when they become suicidal or a threat to someone else. At County-USC 
Medical Center, for instance, the psychiatric emergency room closes to the 
public almost daily because too many people are already inside. 
</P>
<P>
When the Board of Supervisors meets on Monday to begin budget hearings, it will 
have few options to soften the blow of a deficit of $43 million to $45 million 
from assorted state cuts. Officials will propose clinic closings, cuts in 
programs for disturbed children and adolescents and the abolishment of 
emergency teams often called when a deranged person is threatening to kill 
himself or others. The board also will have to eliminate or cut funding to many 
of the 70 or so private mental health agencies that serve county patients. 
</P>
<P>
The county would begin closing clinics within two weeks of the board's 
approval, said Francis Dowling, chief deputy director of the county's mental 
health department. 
</P>
<P>
Those centers are in northeast Los Angeles, La Crescenta, San Fernando, Santa 
Fe Springs, San Pedro, Compton and an emergency center at Metropolitan State 
Hospital in Norwalk. The Inglewood clinic also will be closed if problems with 
the lease can be resolved. In addition, an undetermined number of private 
clinics that receive county funds are expected to close or reduce services. 
</P>
<P>
County officials and mental health advocates blame their problems on historic 
underfunding by the state, which provides 90% of the money for the county's 
mental health network. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the county pays the other 10%. For the last four years, the state's 
contribution to the clinics, the psychiatric hospital wards and other basic 
mental health services has remained at $129 million, said Gurubanda Singh 
Khalsa, the mental health department's financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
With inflation eroding its buying power, the Board of Supervisors for the last 
four years has contributed a total of $31.4 million -- beyond its mandated 
obligation -- to keep the system afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the county anticipated another $129-million appropriation in fiscal 
1990 which would have left it with a $10.2-million shortfall. But officials 
were shocked when they learned earlier this summer that Deukmejian was 
proposing much deeper cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman said he would recommend that the board once again kick in 
extra money. But he acknowledged that, as in previous years, the county has too 
many needy causes to completely bail out the department. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really angry about this," said Mental Health Director Roberto Quiroz of 
the governor's cuts. "It's not a situation where you could stop building a road 
or building an airplane. This is a situation where we are telling people who 
need care we don't have the resources to treat them. It's damn inhumane." 
</P>
<P>
But a state finance official said Deukmejian had little discretion when he 
pared mental health funding. Wanting to maintain a $1.3-billion reserve for 
emergencies, the governor had few places to cut, said Theresa Parker, program 
budget manager for the state's Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
The governor had to dip into the 8% of the state's budget that can be touched 
and that includes the mental health monies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees that as the system crumbles further, the county's psychiatric 
wards and psychiatric emergency rooms at County-USC, King, Harbor-UCLA and 
Olive View Medical Center will be taxed even more. But among the four 
facilities, only 265 psychiatric beds exist. In comparison, New York City has 
1,700. 
</P>
<P>
The psychiatric emergency rooms are often jammed with delusional patients 
because there is no other place to put them, Quiroz said. Ideally, these 
patients would get a bed in one of the hospitals' psychiatric wards. But these 
wards are filled with people who really need to be in a state hospital for 
long-term care. An empty bed at a state hospital, however, is a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
At County-USC, 127 physicians and other health professionals signed a petition 
this spring asking that 100 new psychiatric beds be created in the county. 
Saying they were "distraught and enraged," the physicians said they could not 
properly treat the crush of mental patients. 
</P>
<P>
County-USC's Cordova agreed that the lack of sufficient psychiatric beds has 
created problems, but is not endangering the patients' health. 
</P>
<P>
As the county's mental health system has eroded, no one is keeping track of the 
system's dropouts, but Los Angeles police say they are bringing more disturbed 
people to emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
County officials believe that some people who were barely hanging on are now 
wandering the streets or sitting in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Van Horn, head of the Mental Health Assn. of Los Angeles County, 
predicts that the collapse of the mental health network will prompt the 
doubling of the county's homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
Roslyn Perry, a 46-year-old with a raspy voice and sad eyes, is already a 
casualty. The streets of South-Central Los Angeles swallowed her up when she 
couldn't cope with the hassle of getting seen at a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have 20 or 30 bucks, I forget all about schizophrenia," Perry said. "I 
forget all about epilepsy. I get in my own little world. It's so nice, but you 
can't stay there forever."

POLICE MAKE FIRST ARREST WITH USE OF LOJACK HOMING DEVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Saturday arrested a suspected car thief in the city's first 
successful use of the new "LoJack" homing device used to track and recover 
stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very surprised," Officer Stella Lara of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Stolen Vehicle Recovery Network said of the suspect's reaction 
when told he was the first person to be arrested with the aid of the new 
device. "He thought of himself as a celebrity, because he was the first guy 
that we caught that way." 
</P>
<P>
Lara said the suspect, Tom Sinanian, 21, of Lawndale, allegedly stole the red 
1990 BMW 325i convertible from a car rental lot in the Hollywood area about 
4:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as its owner reported it stolen, police activated the LoJack 
transmitter that had recently been installed in the vehicle, the officer said, 
and within minutes, a police patrol car picked up the unique signal on its 
special LoJack receiver. 
</P>
<P>
It took three patrol cars only 80 minutes to converge on the stolen car, which 
officers pulled over at Arbor Vitae Street and La Cienega Boulevard near Los 
Angeles International Airport, Lara said. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up the signal southbound on (the) 405 (Freeway) at Century," the 
officer said. "At that time, I coordinated with two additional units and set up 
a perimeter." 
</P>
<P>
Lara said the device allows officers to determine a stolen car's direction. She 
said Officer Randy Fudala made the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Lara said the BMW's ignition had been punched out, but was otherwise undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
Sinanian was booked at the Van Nuys jail on suspicion of grand theft auto. He 
was taken to Van Nuys because that jail has an infirmary. Police said the 
suspect apparently had a minor arm injury unrelated to his arrest or the auto 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
The $595 device, manufactured by Massachussetts-based LoJack Corp., is about 
the size of a blackboard eraser, small enough to be hidden in any of 35 places 
in a car. Using special tracking computers installed in patrol cars, police can 
follow a signal emitted by the device within a radius of two to four miles. 
</P>
<P>
Each device emits a signal that is unique to the car it is installed in. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department began using the system last week, Lara said.

GIRL WHO FELL FROM SEAWALL IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENTS: THE CERRITOS CHILD RECOVERS FROM HEAD INJURIES AND CUTS AFTER 
FALLING DURING A FAMILY OUTING ON ANACAPA ISLAND.

What was supposed to be a camping adventure on one of the Channel Islands 
turned into a vacation nightmare for the family of an 8-year-old Cerritos girl 
who fell off a seawall while looking at sea birds. 
</P>
<P>
Maryanne Duarte fell 15 feet and landed on rocks on Anacapa Island Friday, said 
her father Carl, 36, who witnessed the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Maryanne was reported in satisfactory condition Saturday after suffering head 
injuries and cuts on her left arm and leg, said a nursing supervisor at St. 
John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"It has not been a good trip," Duarte said. On the day of his daughter's 
accident, she cut her hand on a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Then Duarte's 64-year-old father, Manuel, panicked and fell, breaking his leg, 
after seeing the child tumble off the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Maryanne, described by her father as somewhat of a tomboy, was on her way back 
to shore after her first camping trip to Anacapa Island when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Maryanne, her sister, grandfather and father were waiting for a National Park 
Service boat to return them to shore when they saw brown pelicans, Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was climbing over a lot of things. When I was at the top, I fell," Maryanne 
said from her hospital bed Saturday. "My dad was there. He said the whole thing 
went so fast." 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service rangers administered first aid to the girl until a Coast 
Guard helicopter from Los Angeles arrived and took her to the hospital, Petty 
Officer Scott Wassermann said. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte said park rangers and Coast Guard officials worked quickly to help 
Maryanne. Coast Guard officials later called to inquire about her health. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone kind of worked together. . . ." Duarte said. "One of the park rangers 
was a paramedic. He was taking all of her vital signs, and I was freaking out 
all this time." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte blamed himself for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was leading his two daughters over the seawall to get a closer look 
at the birds when Maryanne slipped. 
</P>
<P>
She fell over a series of jagged rocks and finally landed about three or four 
feet from the water, Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cuts and bruises, Maryanne suffered a slight cut on her 
liver and must avoid rigorous activity for about 1 1/2 months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to get away from it all," said Duarte, a certified public 
accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an excursion that turned into a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the accident, Duarte said he plans to take his daughters on another 
camping trip to Santa Cruz Island later this fall. On that trip he plans to 
take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
Maryanne "is a muscular little kid. She likes to do different things. She's not 
too afraid of anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But next time, he added, "I'm going to have her tied to a rope."

MISLEADING HOME-SALE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your July 9 article "Buyer's Market -- House Sales Drop 35%" is an 
all-too-familiar example of one-sided misleading reporting which fails to give 
readers the complete picture of Ventura County real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
I was interviewed for this article. When I read it, I was shocked that every 
positive fact I offered had been totally disregarded. 
</P>
<P>
It's true of course that home sales in many areas of the county are slow, but 
there are also very active areas, and Ventura is one of them. As vice president 
of the Ventura Board of Realtors and chairman of the Multiple Listing Service, 
I offer your readers the facts about real estate sales in the city of Ventura: 
</P>
<P>
1. The number of single-family home resales in Ventura during the first half of 
1990 (576) exceeds every such period in history except 1987. 
</P>
<P>
2. Total dollar volume of Ventura home resales in the first half of 1990 ($155 
million) is not only 13% greater than the same period in 1989, but is higher 
than the first six months of any year ever. 
</P>
<P>
3. The average closed sales price of a Ventura home (sales that have actually 
closed escrow) has not dropped, but instead has risen 7.6%, from $249,000 last 
year to $268,000 in the first half of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
4. The only negative statistic for 1990 is market time. On average, it now 
takes 89 days from putting up the for-sale sign until the seller accepts an 
offer. This compares with the record low of 48 days in 1988 and a more normal 
63 days last year. Clean, well-maintained fairly priced homes are selling in 60 
days or less. One sold recently as the sign went up, and several have sold in 
less than 10 days. However, homes priced at more than 5% over closed sales 
prices of comparable homes may not sell at all. 
</P>
<P>
The facts say there are bright spots in the county. That's why 1990 is a rare 
window of opportunity for home buyers on any budget. That's why Ventura homes 
are selling at the second highest rate in history.

WHY ARE LATINOS DESCRIBED AS MILITANTS? WOULD BLACKS HAVE BEEN LABELED THAT 
WAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was shocked by the use of the term "militant" in reference to Latinos in 
Harry Bernstein's July 17 Labor column, "Illegal Alien Law Is Here to Stay." 
</P>
<P>
What made these Latinos "militant?" Were they holding hostages? Were they 
uncivil in pressing their legitimate concerns? Or is it the mere fact that 
these Latinos pressed for agendas that might force the NAACP to consider issues 
outside African-American concerns? 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern media have always had problems reporting on issues affecting the 
diverse Latino community. But how could The Times, in a city with a large 
Latino community, be so insensitive that it would call mainstream politicians 
"militant?" You can bet that the same insult would not be visited on 
African-Americans.

HOPE BURNS ETERNAL AT AGING STATION NO. 2 IN MONTEBELLO; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICES: CITY LEADERS PROMISED TO REBUILD THE COCKROACH-INFESTED FIREHOUSE IN 
THE 1960S. DECADES LATER, A NEW STATION IS IN THE WORKS.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was clear by the late 1960s that Engine Company No. 2, built in the final 
years of World War II, was no longer the gleaming firehouse that had been a 
source of pride to firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The red brick building was so small that some new firetrucks could not fit 
through the doors unless the firefighters folded in the rear-view mirrors. 
There was no heat or central air-conditioning. Three or four firefighters 
shared a tiny room next to the fire engine. And the place was infested with 
cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
City officials promised to remodel or rebuild Engine Company No. 2 in the 
1960s, but nothing happened. In the late 1970s, south side residents were 
assured that a new fire station was all but built, but assurances were all that 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, city leaders said the station would be demolished, prompting 
firefighters to move to a more spacious air-conditioned trailer in the station 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters are still living in the trailer today. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember when I got promoted in 1979, and the talk was that they were 
going to break ground," Battalion Chief Eugene Chavez said. "It never happened. 
. . . It got to be kind of a joke. We've been rebuilding the station for 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
In late June, the City Council approved the plans and specifications for a 
$1.5-million project to level the old fire station and build a new one on the 
site at the corner of Greenwood Avenue and Date Street. 
</P>
<P>
This time, "it's going to happen," Montebello Fire Chief Robert Fager said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, the new 9,300-square-foot station will be nine times 
larger than the current building. It will be capable of housing four trucks, up 
from the one paramedic engine housed there now, and it will include a 
Montebello Police Department community center, where residents can file reports 
or make complaints. There will be a dormitory for the firefighters, a kitchen, 
day room, equipment storage area and a dressing room and bathroom for female 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Engine Company No. 2 was the second of three stations built in Montebello in 
1944, when the town was small enough that a neighbor's tonsil operation or a 
Rotary Club meeting was enough to make front-page news in the weekly paper. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1970s, it has been occupied by paramedic firefighters, who 
respond to both fires and calls for medical aid. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only station that does not have modern facilities, though sometime in 
the 1970s, firefighters who were tired of cramped quarters enclosed the porch 
and turned it into an office, built a bedroom for the captain right behind the 
fire engine and knocked out a wall between the kitchen and the day room to add 
more space. 
</P>
<P>
But officials knew that sooner or later the building would have to be 
demolished. The remodeling raised concerns that the fire engine's proximity to 
sleeping quarters might be hazardous. Unreinforced masonry also made the 
structure vulnerable to earthquake collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"You can just look at it and see that it's past its years of service," Capt. 
Jerry Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
But city leaders said they did not have the money to replace or remodel the 
building before now. The station house, once a source of pride, became an 
example of what South Side residents call the bias city leadership shows 
favoring northern Montebellans. 
</P>
<P>
During November's election, South Side groups pointed out that while city 
leaders were saying they could not build a new fire station in the mid-1980s 
because there was no money, the council approved a $1-million parking lot 
expansion for a North Side disco. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Salazar, who was a leader in a South Side organization, said residents 
are pleased that the new station soon will finally be built. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting a long time," he said. "I guess it's better late than 
never." 
</P>
<P>
Demolition crews knocked down an old house next to the trailer Monday to make 
room for the paramedic engine after the building is demolished. Chief Fager 
said construction of the new station should begin in early September and be 
completed in a year.

DEUKMEJIAN TRUE TO FORM IN PANEL CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: GOVERNOR ONCE AGAIN HITS FAVORITE TARGET, VETOING $656,000 FOR THE 
COASTAL COMMISSION. IT REPRESENTS 10% CUT IN AGENCY BUDGET SENT TO HIM BY THE 
LEGISLATURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the staff of the California Coastal Commission, Gov. George Deukmejian's 
departure from office Jan. 6 will not be an occasion for tears. 
</P>
<P>
The agency -- set up to protect the coastline -- has been a favorite target for 
Deukmejian since he took office in 1983. And the governor, who decided not to 
seek a third term this year, was true to form in his last whack at the state 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, he vetoed $656,000 for the panel's budget as part of $753 million in 
cuts to the fiscal 1990-91 spending plan he signed after a monthlong fight with 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
For the Coastal Commission, Deukmejian's veto represented a 10% cut in the 
agency budget sent to him by the Legislature. It left the commission with a 
budget of about $6.5 million for the fiscal year that began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
James Burns, the commission's chief deputy director, said the money would have 
been used to fill vacant positions, especially for lawyers and analysts, whom 
he described as "the workhorses of the commission." 
</P>
<P>
The money also would have paid travel expenses, he said, so more staff members 
could attend agency meetings, which are held throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
One commission staffer joked that until the governor leaves office in January, 
agency officials plan on "just generally keeping our belts so tight we stay 
blue in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Burns acknowledged that he is looking forward to January, 1991, because the two 
leading gubernatorial candidates -- Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican 
Pete Wilson -- are expected to be more supportive of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
That view was echoed by Melvin Nutter, a Long Beach lawyer who was the panel's 
chairman in 1982-85. "There isn't any question that both of the gubernatorial 
candidates have indicated an interest in and support for the Coastal Commission 
and protection of the coast. That will be a refreshing change. . . . It 
couldn't be any worse," Nutter said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Katz, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, defended 
Deukmejian's latest veto, saying that anyone sitting in the governor's chair 
would have been forced "to make the same difficult decisions" that he did. She 
also said the panel fared better than most state agencies in this year's budget 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Still, panel supporters view Deukmejian's veto as a parting shot at the agency. 
"He's had eight years of this, and this was his last swipe at the commission, 
it would appear," Nutter said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission traces its origins to 1972, when voters approved an initiative 
that set it up. Since 1976, when the Legislature redefined its powers, the 
panel's main responsibility has been passing judgment of local development on 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
During the Administration of Deukmejian's predecessor -- Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr. -- the commission was dominated by environmentalists. But Deukmejian came 
into office viewing the panel as an unnecessary layer of government. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to abolish the panel and turn its duties over to local government, 
Deukmejian in the last eight years has drastically reduced the agency's budget 
and staff. Early in his Administration, for example, Deukmejian successfully 
got the commission to close its office in Eureka. And over the years, its 
full-time enforcement staff has dwindled from six to one to cover the entire 
state. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Elizabeth Hill, state legislative analyst, said that when adjusted 
for inflation, the panel's $6.2-million budget originally proposed by 
Deukmejian for the 1990-91 fiscal year was $2 million less than it was in 
1982-83. And she noted that the panel's work force has been cut from 170 to 110 
in the last eight years, a 35% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest budget battle, while the spending plans for most state agencies 
were reduced across the board by 3%, the panel's was one of those that 
Deukmejian chose to cut by 7% more. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, the commission's chief deputy director, said that even with the cut, the 
panel's annual budget, excluding federal funds, should rise from about $6 
million to an estimated $6.5 million. He said that most of that increase was 
from increased salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Burns also said the blow of Deukmejian's veto was somewhat softened because the 
Legislature added $651,000 from the license plate fund -- proceeds from the 
sale of vanity plates -- to offset a 1668641824budget.

LONG BEACH STABBING TRIGGERS UPROAR; POLICE CALL ATTACK RANDOM

Kim Labourdette's death could have been just another crime statistic in a city 
that has seen its share of the reckless, senseless violence of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
But the 38-year-old bartender was gay, and since the night he was mugged and 
stabbed to death on Broadway, Labourdette's killing has triggered an uproar in 
the local gay community almost as dramatic and unexpected as the attack itself. 
</P>
<P>
Police say there is no evidence that Labourdette was killed because he was gay; 
they say he was murdered while being robbed. But gay activists view the killing 
as the latest example of what they perceive as a significant increase in 
attacks on gays. 
</P>
<P>
In the four weeks since the murder, gay activists have been holding protest 
marches, distributing leaflets and forming committees that, among other things, 
are considering equipping area bars with safety-oriented videotapes. They are 
also establishing a 24-hour hot line to report harassment and attacks and are 
organizing neighborhood watch teams to cut down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
Few gays walk alone on the streets any more, and in the restaurants and bars 
that cater to the gay community, there is fear and uncertainly. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been violence against gays," said Mark Foster, a member of the 
local chapter of ACT-UP, a militant gay organization that has taken an interest 
in the case. "But we think it's at a fever pitch right now." 
</P>
<P>
Labourdette had been dining with friends July 5 at a restaurant on Broadway 
when he left to walk across the street to buy cigarettes about 9:30 p.m. He 
didn't get far. Immediately outside, two men jumped from a car, stabbed him 
repeatedly and rifled his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who have no suspects, say the motive appears to have been simple 
robbery and that the victim's selection was random. 
</P>
<P>
But some gays say the unusual viciousness of the stabbings and the attack's 
location in the middle of the city's most visibly gay neighborhood indicates to 
them that the selection may not have been random. In fact, they say, the attack 
has the earmarks of being part of a rising tide of verbal and physical 
harassment of gays along the Broadway corridor -- a two-mile stretch centered 
roughly on Bixby Park at Broadway and Cherry Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police insist that the area is relatively safe, with fewer assaults, murders 
and robberies on record than many other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a low-crime area, considering the city as a whole," said police 
spokesman Melvin Gallwas, who added that crime statistics reveal no assault 
upsurge in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"During the many times I've monitored the situation," he said, "the place 
looked (quiet) as a ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rosen disagrees. Chairman of the police relations committee of the 
gay-oriented Lambda Democratic Club for the last year, Rosen said many crimes 
against gays go unreported because of the unwillingness of some gays to be so 
identified and their general distrust of police. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Rosen said, his own statistics seem to contradict those of the police. 
Part of his job is to field calls from gays complaining of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, he was averaging one or two calls a month, but today he is 
getting up to four a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a noticeable increase," said Rosen, adding that the incidents range 
from name-calling to physical assaults. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, the perception of danger seems to have mobilized the gay 
community. A rally and protest march last weekend drew about 150 people. Local 
members of ACT-UP are planning a community meeting Aug. 17, followed by another 
public rally later this month. And in the bars along Broadway, fears seem 
palpable. 
</P>
<P>
"We walk out in groups," said David Bowling, 31, a waiter who frequents the 
bars. "We kind of watch out for each other." 
</P>
<P>
"I only live two blocks away," added Jim Forbes, 26, "but I drive here now." 
</P>
<P>
Activists are not sure what has caused the increase in attacks. Some said gays 
are finding themselves subjected to more abuse because society itself seems to 
be more violent, because fear of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is growing 
and because anti-gay hysteria is too. 
</P>
<P>
Others said that even though some attackers have nothing against gays in 
particular, they are more likely to act against a population that, according to 
the stereotype, is less likely to fight back. And some blamed a neighborhood 
action taken by the city last year for contributing to the problem: 
specifically, the gating of Bixby Park. 
</P>
<P>
Long known as a cruising area for male homosexuals and prostitutes, as well as 
a gathering place for drug dealers and vagrants, the park was the subject of 
several community meetings in 1989. Acting on recommendations from a 
neighborhood coalition that included gays, the city finally increased police 
patrols, enacted an anti-cruising ordinance and built gates to stem the flow of 
foot traffic through the park from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most area residents now say there is much less criminal activity 
in the park. But the same criminal element that once gathered in the park, some 
activists complain, now wanders along Broadway, creating an unhealthy 
atmosphere in which gay bashing is more likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen, who as a member of Lambda sat on the panel that drafted the park 
recommendations, sees Bixby Park as a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter where the crime takes place," he said, "a victim is a 
victim. Closing the park (at night) has not led to an increase in the number of 
assaults anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
At least one element of the community -- an ad hoc group called Community 
Response Network, formed shortly after the Labourdette killing -- says it 
intends to pursue the problem as a general matter of crime affecting the entire 
neighborhood, gays and non-gays alike. 
</P>
<P>
ACT-UP members say they have organized informal neighborhood patrols to watch 
out for fellow gays. 
</P>
<P>
"Harassment is very common down in that corridor," said Bob Brown, who is 
coordinating the group's anti-bashing effort. "Hopefully, just our presence 
will deter any (potential attacks) in our vision."

More than 11 years ago, Sandra (Sam) Bradley was making good money as a 
cocktail waitress, but she longed for a career change. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed my job, but I started wondering what would happen in several years 
when my legs were gone," Bradley said. "I was concerned. I also needed 
something where there was more advancement," said Bradley, whom everyone calls 
Sam. (She got the nickname as a teen-age tomboy and it stuck.) 
</P>
<P>
When a television series about paramedics piqued her interest, Bradley took a 
course in basic emergency medical training at Santa Ana College. Soon she was 
hired as an emergency medical technician by American Medical Enterprises Inc. 
in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
After working for several years as a medical attendant and ambulance driver for 
American Medical, Bradley graduated from Daniel Freeman Paramedic School in 
Inglewood. She has worked since then as a paramedic, field supervisor and 
instructor of emergency medical training for American Medical. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started, females were rare. Men 18 and 19 were getting into the 
business. I was 32," Bradley said. "I have not regretted the change in careers. 
After more than 11 years, I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the 43-year-old Whittier resident was named the 1990 Emergency 
Medical Services Employee of the Year. The honor was given by the California 
Ambulance Assn., a private association representing about 70 companies 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
She was recommended for the award because of her dedication to the job, a 
continuing quest to become more knowledgeable about her field and her volunteer 
work, American Medical founder and owner Joan Woehrmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley currently is assigned to the Vernon Fire Department as a paramedic. The 
city contracts with American Medical Enterprises for paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
"She is very good. She is one of the best out there. She is a dedicated 
person," Vernon Fire Chief Larry Spadt said.

DOYLE SUIT SETTLED WITHOUT TRIAL FOR 6-FIGURE AMOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civil lawsuit against Judith M. Doyle, a gay and lesbian community activist 
and former family therapist, has been settled without coming to trial in Long 
Beach Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Doyle and the plaintiff, Patricia A. Lamis, appeared before 
Superior Court Judge Norman Gordon on July 27 and agreed that Lamis should 
receive compensation, in six figures, for emotional, mental and career damages 
stemming from a sexual relationship she had with Doyle in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle's attorney, Peter Zomber, would not reveal the exact value of the award, 
saying he was not sure if the attorneys involved had agreed to disclose the 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
Zomber said Doyle had counseled Lamis until April, 1983, but the sexual affair 
did not begin until four months later. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle's insurance carrier, American Home Assurance, agreed to cover the 
settlement but reserved its right to recoup its losses from Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody walked away from this thrilled to death," Zomber said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Doyle, whose license was revoked July 18 by the state Board of 
Behavioral Science Examiners, will begin an appeal of that decision Sept. 24. 
At issue is the lack of a procedure of formally documenting how a 
client-therapist relationship is terminated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was standard in the early 1980s to not take notes (during a counseling 
session) and the question now is how to prove that a relationship ended when a 
patient says such a discussion never occurred," Zomber explained. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle, who practiced in Long Beach, formerly worked as director of the AIDS 
Response Program of Orange County.

STREET CLOSURES URGED NEAR DANA STRAND HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has called for the closure of 
several streets and alleys near the Dana Strand housing project in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
In a motion she introduced at a council meeting, Flores said closing the roads 
will enable city officials to erect a security fence around the public housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The fence, she said, would "create a more secure community by helping to reduce 
crime and protecting improvements" to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The fence and other improvements are part of a $14-million face lift to housing 
projects throughout the city, paid for by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
The action, officials said, is not related to recent gang violence at Dana 
Strand. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been in the works for some time; we were just waiting for engineering 
reports to be completed," Flores spokeswoman Karen Constine said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' proposal, forwarded by the council to its Public Works Committee, calls 
for closing King Avenue from C to F streets; D Street from Hawaiian Avenue to 
Wilmington Boulevard; E Street from Hawaiian to Wilmington; the alley east of 
Hawaiian from E to C streets, and the alley west of Wilmington from F to C 
streets.

SACRAMENTO / BRADLEY INMAN; 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRIAL SPIES TAKE NOTE: PROSECUTING THEFT OF SECRETS JUST GOT EASIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, BRADLEY INMAN is an Oakland writer specializing in California 
business issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1985, U.S. District Judge Murray Schwartz in Delaware tried to force 
Coca-Cola Co. to divulge its secret formula. He didn't succeed, but since that 
time businesses have been nervous about losing trade secrets in open court. 
</P>
<P>
In California, companies can now rest a little easier. A bill approved by the 
state legislature last month and signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian 
limits public and media access to criminal trials that involve trade secrets. 
Introduced by Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush (R-Cupertino), the legislation 
also makes it easier to prosecute theft of trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90% of all trade secret cases never go to trial because defendants who 
possess confidential information often threaten to reveal trade practices in 
open court as part of their defense, according to expert testimony before the 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"A defendant's first move upon being charged with trade secret theft is to 
serve subpoenas on the victim," said Santa Clara County Deputy District Atty. 
Kenneth Rosenblatt, who proposed the legislation to Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
"Claiming that the thrust of his or her defense will be that the secret is in 
fact public information, the defense will request thousands of documents 
disclosing other trade secrets," said Rosenblatt, who heads up the county's 
high-tech crime unit. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in a case pending before the San Jose Municipal Court, George 
Hwang and Alfred Chan are charged with stealing trade secrets from Intel Corp. 
In this case, both the district attorney and Intel are concerned about trade 
secrets being leaked in oral testimony or from documents subpoenaed by the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "gray mail," the practice often discourages victimized companies from 
pressing charges against trade secret thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt concedes that "closing courtrooms is a delicate task," but "the 
problem is that California's criminal law does not provide for protection of 
trade secrets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quackenbush points out that current law permits judges to restrict public 
access in civil cases, and state law already provides exceptions to the rule in 
other criminal cases. For example, proceedings can be closed to protect child 
witnesses in sex cases and other witnesses whose lives may be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
The California Constitution states that, "when there is good cause for such 
action based upon justice or protection of the parties," closure is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
The Quackenbush measure establishes specific rules for when a judge can close 
criminal proceedings in a trade secret case. The bill authorizes the court to 
issue a protective order when the owner of a trade secret asserts during a 
trial that confidential information may be divulged. Either the prosecutor or 
the company can petition for closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind that, under this legislation, the only time a judge can close the 
proceedings is when there is a substantial probability that the trade secret 
will be endangered," said Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the bill had its critics. Initially, both the California 
Newspaper Publishers Assn. and the American Civil Liberties Union opposed it. 
They said the legislation would set off a constitutional clash because of a 
defendant's right to a public trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult balancing act between the public's right to know and the 
value of business trade secrets," said Margaret Pena, legislative director for 
the ACLU in Sacramento. "At first it was tipped the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
However, the ACLU dropped its opposition when the bill was amended requiring 
the court to make findings that there is no overriding public interest in the 
proceedings being closed. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers decided to take no position on the legislation after Quackenbush 
put a requirement in the bill that the court notify the news media that a 
request had been made to seal papers or close access to a trial. The changes 
also give interested groups, such as newspapers, an opportunity to protest a 
judge's decision to close proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the newspaper lobby is still insisting that any state legislation on 
trade secrets should give judges clear direction on what constitutes cause for 
closing a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a valid trade secret, then it should be protected," said attorney Ed 
Davis, who specializes in media law and assisted the newspaper group in 
crafting its position. "But we were worried that judges and prosecutors might 
be cavalier about what is and what isn't a secret." 
</P>
<P>
Follow-up legislation is being crafted to address this specific concern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimum Wage Rise Seems Likely, Someday 
</P>
<P>
The California Industrial Welfare Commission just wrapped up public hearings on 
the minimum wage, but don't expect swift action on increasing the 
$4.25-per-hour wage floor. 
</P>
<P>
Before the minimum can be increased, the state will go through an elaborate 
bureaucratic exercise that involves stacks of paperwork, several studies, 
nearly a dozen hearings and hundreds of hours of debate. 
</P>
<P>
According to state law, the Industrial Welfare Commission decides 
single-handedly whether the minimum wage shall be increased, but it never acts 
on impulse. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the commission increased the minimum wage, it took more than two 
years of wrangling. The new limit was approved in December, 1987, and it went 
into effect on July 1, 1988. (On April 1 of this year, the federal minimum wage 
was increased to $3.80. Next March, it goes to $4.25. But the higher state 
minimum takes precedence.) 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the commission could decide to increase the wage limit at its 
meeting this month based on input from the three hearings that were held in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't count on it," said Karla Yates, executive officer of the commission. 
Several vacancies on the commission haven't been filled by the governor or 
confirmed by the Senate, so even getting a quorum could be an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, before any action is taken on the minimum wage, the commission must 
call for the creation of a special wage board to investigate the need for an 
increase, which means more study, hearings and discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to increasing the minimum wage, we go out of our way to 
encourage participation," Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
If two-thirds of the wage board members agree to increase the minimum wage, 
then the commission must go along. But this, too, is very unlikely: The 
membership of the board is evenly divided between employers and employees.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL KRUGMAN: A EUROPE-WIDE CURRENCY MAKES NO 
ECONOMIC SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL KRUGMAN, PAUL R. KRUGMAN is professor of economics at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of European unity -- the transmutation of the European Community from 
a free trade area to a full-fledged economic union and eventually to a federal 
political system -- has become virtually unstoppable, even in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wanted to stop the process with trade; she has 
been an ardent opponent of British entry into the so-called exchange rate 
mechanism of the European Monetary System, which stabilizes exchange rates 
within Europe. But she has effectively lost that struggle; Britain is now 
expected to join the exchange rate mechanism in the very near future. 
</P>
<P>
And this is a more pregnant move than a decision to join five years ago would 
have been, because the European Monetary System has clearly become a way 
station on the route to a common European currency. And as the Germans have 
just reminded us, a currency union is not much different from a political 
union. 
</P>
<P>
What is ironic is that Thatcher, who gained a reputation for leadership by 
putting her economy through incredible punishment in the 1980s, now looks weak, 
foolish and silly for clinging to a position that makes considerable economic 
sense. On purely economic grounds, the case against a common European currency 
is actually quite strong. 
</P>
<P>
Why should one ever want to have separate national currencies? Because 
sometimes it is very helpful to be able to change the value of one currency 
relative to another. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose, for example, there is a sharp drop in worldwide demand for goods made 
in Britain. To cope with such a shock, Britain must both make its goods cheaper 
and attract new industries to replace the shrunken old ones. The only quick way 
to do this is to reduce British wages, to make its labor more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
But how can all British wages be reduced quickly? In the face of sustained high 
unemployment, workers might be persuaded to accept lower wages, and the whole 
wage structure could gradually be squeezed down to a competitive level. But the 
economic and social cost of reducing wages by, say, 15% would be huge. In 
contrast, a 15% devaluation of the pound on foreign exchange markets would 
accomplish the same thing instantly and almost painlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, imagine a surge in demand for British products. This would bid up 
the prices of British goods and services, possibly building an inflationary 
momentum that would later prove hard to stop -- unless Britain accommodated the 
surge by allowing the pound, instead of the price level, to rise. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that it can be very convenient to change the value of your 
currency rather than experience painful inflation and deflation. Once Britain 
has accepted a common European currency, as it may well do this century, that 
option will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the argument is not that one-sided. If it were, then not only should 
every country have its own currency, so should each region within a country. 
Why not a Southern California dollar, or even a San Diego dollar? There must be 
some kind of trade-off. And there is. Having your own currency brings costs as 
well as benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, it is more difficult to do business when the contracting 
partners keep their books and pay their workers in different currencies. So 
keeping your own currency acts as a barrier to potentially beneficial 
international trade and investment. 
</P>
<P>
The economic theory of the "optimum currency area" says this trade-off gets 
less and less favorable as the size of the economic unit shrinks. An 
independent currency for San Diego would not make sense. On one side, residents 
of San Diego do so much business with other Americans that the costs of keeping 
track of a separate currency would be huge. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, changing the value of a local San Diego currency would 
probably be ineffective as a way of cutting or raising wages because workers in 
such a tiny currency area would almost surely want to index their wages to some 
outside standard. So it only makes sense to have an independent currency for an 
economic unit large enough to do most of its business with itself, and to have 
some prospect of an independent wage- and price-setting process. 
</P>
<P>
But how large is this optimum unit? Nobody knows -- and it is not at all crazy 
to imagine that Europe might be better off economically with four or five 
regional currencies than with only one. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it is all too likely that in the next several years Germany will 
be a boom economy, as it gets most of the business from the reconstruction of 
Eastern Europe. To fight inflation, the German central bank will keep interest 
rates high; these high interest rates will depress other European economies, 
notably Britain's. There will be a clear economic case for devaluation of 
Britain's currency against the German mark. Yet this will be difficult under 
the European monetary system and impossible once a common currency has been 
established. 
</P>
<P>
Against this one might use the example of the United States -- 260 million 
people living with only one currency. We're doing fine, aren't we? Not 
necessarily. During the first half of the 1980s, when the United States was 
fighting inflation with high unemployment, the harshest burden of that 
unemployment was concentrated in the Midwestern industrial heartland. Had there 
been a separate Midwestern currency, it is arguable that inflation might have 
been controlled at significantly lower cost. Right now, as the economy of the 
Northeast fights a serious slump, one wonders whether we wouldn't all be better 
off if Mario Cuomo could devalue a regional currency. 
</P>
<P>
But of course the idea of separate currencies within the United States is 
unthinkable, for the same reason that a common European currency is now 
inevitable. Whatever the strict economies of currency union, a common currency 
is a potent political instrument: a symbol of unity. 
</P>
<P>
And this symbol may be most important when it makes the least economic sense. 
In terms of economic geography, Canada makes no sense as a currency area: each 
province's natural business linkages are with the U.S. regions to its south, 
not with fellow Canadians. Yet Canada needs an independent, unified currency to 
exist as a nation. (In the long run, it may cease to exist anyway; but, as John 
Maynard Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead.) 
</P>
<P>
As the 20th Century nears its end, the idea of European unity has finally 
become real, and to symbolize that idea, Europe must have a unified currency. 
The common currency may not do much economic good; it may even do some harm, 
but that is beside the point.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: REVERSE MORTGAGE TURNS HOME EQUITY INTO CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I recently heard of something called a reverse mortgage. I own my home free 
and clear and believe it is worth about $400,000. I am on a fixed income and 
would like to tap into my equity so I can have more money. I am an 82-year-old 
widow and live alone. I checked with three bankers in Southern California and 
all told me no reverse mortgage program was available in the state. Is this 
true? -- M.B.". 
</P>
<P>
A: No. But it's not surprising that you've had difficulty getting the full 
story on these complex and sometimes controversial mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Reverse annuity mortgages were first offered in California in 1980 to help 
senior citizens who have substantial equities in their homes but need more cash 
to meet their living expenses. Basically, these mortgages allow owners who owe 
little or nothing on their home mortgages to tap into their equity without 
selling their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they work: Typically, a lending institution makes the homeowner a 
loan based on the borrower's age -- the minimum ranges from 62 to 65 -- and the 
property's appraised value. After taking its loan fees and points, the 
institution pays the homeowner the balance of the loan either in equal monthly 
installments, in a lump sum or as a line of credit for as long as the borrower 
continues living in the home. The loan balance -- actually the amount dispersed 
plus interest and loan fees -- is repaid when the house is sold by the owner or 
his heirs. 
</P>
<P>
These open-ended loans are complicated because it's impossible to know how long 
the homeowner will continue to live in the house. If he stays just a brief 
time, the reverse mortgage proves a costly way to pull equity out of the house 
because loan fees and points on the full potential loan amount are assessed at 
the outset. However, if he stays a very long time, the lending institution 
stands to pay out more than the home may be worth. Because of the risk, several 
institutions offering reverse mortgages charge an additional "guaranty fee" or 
require that they share in the appreciation of the home's value during the 
course of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Assn. of Retired Persons, three private lenders offer 
reverse mortgages to Californians. They are: American Homestead in New Jersey, 
(800) 233-4762; Providential Home Income Plan in San Francisco, (800) 441-4428, 
and Capital Holding Corp. in Kentucky, (800) 942-6550. 
</P>
<P>
Each lender offers a slightly different loan package, explains Bronwyn Belling, 
a housing specialist at the AARP, so it is important for borrowers to carefully 
evaluate their choices before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Belling said that with a $200,000 loan at current interest rates, monthly 
payments from the three lenders mentioned previously would range from $903 to 
$1,124, with substantially varying requirements and restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about reverse mortgages, send a self-addressed, stamped 
envelop to the Independent Living Resource Center, 70 10th St., San Francisco, 
Calif. 94103. Another source is the American Assn. of Retired Persons. Send a 
postcard asking for Home-Made Money to AARP Fulfillment D-12894, 1909 K St.

Social Security Taxes Just Keep on Coming 
</P>
<P>
-: It's already August, and I'm still paying Social Security taxes. How much do 
I have to earn before I satisfy my obligation? It seems as though I finished 
paying the tax earlier last year. -- M.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: You didn't imagine it; you did finish paying your Social Security taxes 
earlier last year. This year, the Social Security tax rate and the maximum 
earnings subject to the tax were increased. 
</P>
<P>
The tax rate paid by employees, as well as their employers, this year is 7.65%, 
up from 7.51% in 1989. This year the rate is applied to the first $51,300 of 
earnings, for a maximum Social Security tax obligation of $3,924.45. Last year, 
the tax rate was applied to the first $48,000 of earnings, and the maximum 
amount of taxes paid by employees was $3,604.80. 
</P>
<P>
For 1991, the tax rate remains at 7.65%, but the amount of earnings subject to 
the tax has not yet been set. The level is established annually by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Spouses Can Reap Tax Break After Split 
</P>
<P>
-: My wife and I are getting a divorce. One of us will keep the house, and the 
other will buy another place in which to live. Is there any way we can both 
keep the $125,000 tax exclusion for home sale profits? -- I.C.". 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes; assuming that each of you is individually qualified to take advantage 
of the tax break, each may leave the marriage with a full $125,000 exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tax laws, an individual or a married couple may exclude from taxation 
$125,000 of profits from the sale of their home if certain conditions are met. 
In the case of couples, at least one must be age 55 or more, and both must have 
owned and lived in the home for three of the past five years. Individuals must 
meet all three qualifications on their own, and once divorced, each former 
spouse must meet those three requirements to take the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
A caveat: Be sure that your divorce is completely final before selling the 
house you shared. If you are still married when you sell, you qualify for only 
a single $125,000 exemption that you would both be required to share, even if 
you file separate tax returns.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: TIPS FOR PLANNING A RECESSION-PROOF PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL SING

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer spending is tailing off. Real estate prices are languishing. Corporate 
profits are slipping. Job growth is sluggish. Purchasing managers' activity is 
slowing. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make you fear a possible recession on the horizon. But if one 
comes, are you -- and your investments -- ready? 
</P>
<P>
Making money -- or at least not losing it -- is not easy in a recession. Many 
stocks and real estate investments could be big losers. Your savings accounts 
won't lose money, but their yields will look lousy as interest rates tumble. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some suggestions for elements of a possible recession portfolio: 
</P>
<P>
* Long-term bonds and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
These may be the best investments for a recession. Why? Because in a recession, 
interest rates typically fall. That increases the value of already issued 
bonds, giving a hefty capital gain in addition to income from interest 
payments. The longer the bond's maturity, the higher the possible gain. 
</P>
<P>
Such gains can be quite dramatic. Take the longest maturity bonds currently 
available, 40-year bonds issued by Refco (short for Resolution Funding Corp.), 
a federal agency created to help finance the savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The "stripped" zero-coupon versions of these bonds -- those that don't make 
periodic interest payments but instead are sold at a deep discount from their 
face value -- will produce a whopping annualized gain of 166% if interest rates 
fall 1.5 percentage points in six months, according to Larry Biehl, director of 
Bailard, Biehl &amp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., investment advisory firm. If 
rates fall only 1 percentage point in six months, the gain on an annualized 
basis is 103%. 
</P>
<P>
Gains on 30-year zero-coupon Treasury bonds can also be quite impressive, Biehl 
notes. If rates fall 1.5 points in six months, your gain is 117%; if that 
happens in 12 months, the gain in 41%. 
</P>
<P>
But timing is important. If rates go up instead, as can happen in a recession, 
you will lose money -- but your loss won't be quite as big as the potential 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
How can you invest? You can buy bonds from a broker or through bond mutual 
funds. The most extensive family of bond funds investing in zero-coupon 
Treasuries is Benham Management Corp., at (800) 472-3389. Its Target funds 
allow you to pick the maturity you want, depending on the risk you wish to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
* Cash equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
In a recession, you'll want to have access to lots of cash. For one, things 
could really get bad and you might lose your job. Also, you'll want cash to 
take advantage of the many bargains that will become available, particularly in 
stocks and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best vehicle to hold cash in a recession? Federally insured savings 
deposits are among the safest, but you might consider money market mutual 
funds. They are virtually as safe as federally insured savings, but yields are 
better than many bank and thrift accounts. And you can get your money out more 
quickly than certificates of deposit and Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
* Gold and gold funds. 
</P>
<P>
Gold normally rises during times of inflation, not when prices are falling, as 
is sometimes the case in a recession. But gold also does well during severe 
economic crises and political turmoil, argues John Markese, research director 
for the American Assn. of Individual Investors. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a calamity involved, gold makes sense," Markese says. You can buy 
the metal directly, but a better bet might be to buy stocks of gold-mining 
firms, either directly or through mutual funds. Unlike the metal, gold stocks 
pay dividends. They also are more volatile, moving up or down quicker and 
farther. 
</P>
<P>
* Stocks and stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks of utilities, food processors and non-durable goods manufacturers tend 
to do better in economic bad times, says Donald J. Phillips, editor of Mutual 
Fund Values, a Chicago-based investment advisory service. On the other hand, he 
says, recessions are hard on stocks of firms in cyclical industries such as 
autos, transportation and natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a good idea to maintain some investment in European and Asian stocks 
or international-stock mutual funds. "Not every country goes through a 
recession at the same time," Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
But timing is also important. Stock prices normally decline prior to the start 
of a recession and for the first few months into it. You may not want to buy 
until the recession is well recognized and discounted. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips outlines three categories of stock mutual funds suitable for a 
recession portfolio. The most conservative category, income funds, generally 
invest in bonds and stocks paying high dividends and generally offer yields of 
about 7% to 8%. In this group, he likes Value Line Income (800) 223-0818, USAA 
Income (800) 531-8000 and Wellesley Income (800) 662-7447. All invest heavily 
in utility stocks and high-quality bonds. 
</P>
<P>
He also likes balanced funds, which are a bit more aggressive in the stocks 
they pick. In this group, Phillips likes Twentieth Century Balanced, (800) 
345-2021, which is heavily invested in consumer non-durables, retailers and 
utilities; Pax World, (603) 431-8022, a stock and bond fund that applies social 
and ethical criteria to its investment choices, and Axe-Houghton Fund B, (800) 
366-0444, now heavy into utilities and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
More aggressive investors might be interested in a third group of equity funds 
that includes Lindner Dividend, (314) 727-5305, now heavily into utilities and 
financial services firms, Phillips says. It did well in the last recession, 
rising 26.3% in 1981 when the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 5%. 
</P>
<P>
He also likes SoGen International, (800) 334-2143, a fund that has never had a 
down year since 1978, when its current manager took over; Greenspring, (301) 
435-9000, which invests part of its portfolio in troubled firms expected to 
come back, and Pennsylvania Mutual, (800) 221-4268, which specializes in small 
companies and has not had a down year since 1973, when one of its co-managers 
took over.

WINFIELD WINS IT IN 12TH; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: HIS BASES-LOADED HIT BEATS ATHLETICS. GRAHE HAS PROMISING DEBUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels finally found a way to build a lead the Oakland Athletics couldn't 
erase: score the winning run in extra innings at home. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield's 2,499th career hit, a fly-ball single to the warning track in 
left field, scored Dick Schofield with the decisive run with one out in the 
12th inning Saturday night as the Angels beat the A's, 6-5, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's hit won the game while a fan cavorted in right field. Time was not 
called, and the game continued. The A's, whose lead over the second-place 
Chicago White Sox was cut to 2 1/2 games, did not protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see anybody behind me," said right fielder Jose Canseco. "Was she 
good-looking?" 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who had squandered a 5-1 lead, put together the winning rally when 
Todd Burns (2-3) walked leadoff hitter Schofield on four pitches in the 12th. 
Dante Bichette moved Schofield to second with a sacrifice. Joe Klink replaced 
Burns and walked Max Venable and Devon White to load the bases. Winfield then 
collected his second hit of the game, giving the Angels only their second 
victory over the A's in nine games this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We demonstrated we can do it," Winfield said. "We needed to. We had a couple 
of games that got out of our hands. They're a tough team to hold down." 
</P>
<P>
"He can handle it from the emotional standpoint," Angel Manager Doug Rader said 
of Winfield, "No. 2, he has the physical tools." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were unable to protect a 6-0 lead last week at the Oakland Coliseum 
and another 6-0 lead Friday at Anaheim Stadium. Their inability to hold the 5-1 
lead they built Saturday inspired boos from many in the season-high crowd of 
52,774, but those who remained for the end cheered wildly when Schofield scored 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Eichhorn (2-4), the fourth Angel pitcher, was credited with the victory. 
He pitched the 11th and 12th, giving up one hit. The veteran reliever had 
allowed at least one earned run in each of his last four appearances and six of 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Grahe (pronounced gray) started in place of Bert Blyleven, who was at home 
with his family after his wife and three of his four children were involved in 
a car accident Thursday. Grahe, whose contract was purchased from triple-A 
Edmonton early Saturday, gave up four runs -- three of them earned -- over 5 
1/3 innings and struck out Canseco twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who had lost seven of their previous eight games against the A's, 
avoided dropping 17 games out of first place and falling six games under .500 
for the first time since they were 17-23 on May 22. 
</P>
<P>
Grahe's first major league pitch was a strike, but the next four were balls, 
putting Rickey Henderson on first. Henderson stole his 919th base -- 19 behind 
all-time leader Lou Brock -- on the first pitch to Carney Lansford and went to 
third when the throw by catcher Lance Parrish hit him and rolled into left 
field. He scored when Lansford grounded to second. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had runners on base in each of the first three innings but couldn't 
score. They finally got to Mike Moore in the fourth, taking a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
White led off with a triple over Canseco's head in right. Winfield walked. Lee 
Stevens singled up the middle, scoring White and sending Winfield to third. 
Winfield scored on Johnny Ray's single to center. Anderson walked, loading the 
bases, and, after Dick Schofield struck out, Luis Polonia lined an 0-and-2 
pitch into the right-field corner, clearing the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Grahe was in control until the sixth, when the A's scored three times to cut 
the Angels' lead to 5-4. Doubles by Dave Henderson and Felix Jose sandwiched 
around a walk to Mark McGwire -- his third walk of the game -- produced one 
run, and Walt Weiss' single to right scored McGwire and Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Young couldn't hold off the A's in the eighth, when they tied the game and 
deprived Grahe of a chance to earn a victory. McGwire led off with a walk and 
Lance Blankenship ran for him. Jose bunted him to second and he scored on 
Weiss' single to left. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Joe Grahe, catcher Ron Tingley was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list because of tendinitis in his right hand. . . . Grahe was 1-0 in 
three starts for Edmonton with a 1.46 earned-run average in 24 2/3/ innings. He 
began the season with double-A Midland, where he was 7-5 with a 5.14 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure believes his elbow is fully healed after pitching two perfect 
innings for Class-A Palm Springs Friday.

QUIET AMERICAN'S RUN UPSETTING TO BAYAKOA

Gary Jones was in a hurry late Saturday. He didn't want to miss the replay of 
the eighth race. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to see this again to believe it," the trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
What had Jones eager to get to a television set was Quiet American's impressive 
upset of Bayakoa in the $157,300 San Diego Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first start since April 14, the 4-year-old son of Fappiano caught 
the 1-2 favorite with about a quarter of a mile to run and from there the only 
question was what the final victory margin would be. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his 1:40 2/5 journey for the 1 1/16 miles, Quiet American was a 
little more than two lengths ahead of the Eclipse-Award winning mare, who was 
spotting him seven pounds (122-115). 
</P>
<P>
Well-beaten with excuses in his previous two starts -- the Santa Anita Handicap 
and the Budweiser Breeders' Cup at Golden Gate -- Quiet American looked like 
the horse who had displayed so much promise in his first two outings in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the retirements of Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, the Florida-bred 
and 7-2 second choice could be headed for New York with the prime objective the 
Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"If Ruhlmann turns up here (in the $300,000 Cabrillo Aug. 25), I might go to 
New York and see what he can do there," Jones said. "If he runs good there, 
I'll know I have a horse for the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"He came back fine, didn't he? I wasn't that confident going in because I had 
to see him get back to that level. I was extremely disappointed in the Big 
'Cap, and when he stumbled in the race up north, he never ran a step after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give Bayakoa credit, though. She ran well. He's a great, big stud 
colt and she had to give him a lot of weight." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was also sweet for Kent Desormeaux, who had attempted to upset 
Bayakoa aboard Fantastic Look, another Jones trainee, in the Milady Handicap 
June 16 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thrill to beat a horse like her," he said. "All you ever hear is 
Bayakoa. We beat the filly of the world. Right now, this kind of thing compares 
to winning No. 547 (to break Chris McCarron's record for most victories in a 
year). 
</P>
<P>
"Today was Quiet American's day. He ran tremendous. He just blew her away and 
separated the men from the girls. Mr. Jones and I talked over strategy this 
morning and the race was pretty much run the way we figured it. You can't take 
anything away from her. She kept on digging in the stretch to get second. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on him once, in his last work, which was absolutely great. He blistered 
the last eighth when he was supposed to be galloping out." 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa's trainer, Ron McAnally, didn't come down to unsaddle Bayakoa after the 
San Diego, so he wasn't available for comment, but Laffit Pincay had no excuses 
for the champion mare. 
</P>
<P>
"She ran well," he said after Bayakoa's second loss against males this year. 
She was beaten by 29 lengths in the Santa Anita Handicap in early March. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't give up. The pace was nice and slow (23 1/5 and 46 3/5 for the 
half-mile) and when I saw Quiet American come up on the outside, I tried to 
stay ahead of him, but I couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
"The other horse was too good for her today. What surprised me was how he went 
by me so strong because I had a lot of horse at the time. She was trying." 
</P>
<P>
Bosphorus, the longest shot in the field at nearly 18-1, was third, 3 1/2 
lengths behind Bayakoa. Leger Cat was fourth, then came Kunjar and Charlatan. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Nakatani will be sidelined for at least 10 days after suffering a broken 
hand in a fight with jockey Orlando Garrido Thursday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The injury cost Nakatani the mount on Itsallgreektome, with whom he combined to 
win two stakes at Hollywood Park, in today's La Jolla Handicap. Julio Garcia, 
who replaced Nakatani on Palomar Handicap upsetter Jabalina Brown last 
Saturday, will take over on Itsallgreektome. Nakatani missed the Palomar after 
suffering a neck injury while working horses in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was a profitable day on both coasts for trainer Brian Mayberry and owners 
Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
Prospectors Gamble, who won the Triple Bend and Bel Air Handicaps at Hollywood 
Park, defeated Sewickley by 2 1/2 lengths in Saratoga's A Phenomenon. It was 
the third victory in four starts for the 5-year-old roan son of Crafty 
Prospector in tandem with Julio Garcia and he covered the six furlongs in 1:09 
1/5. 
</P>
<P>
At Del Mar, Movinglikeawinner won his third consecutive race when he beat 
$80,000 claimers in the third race. The Highland Park colt has now won six of 
his 18 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes. 
</P>
<P>
Jovial, who upset Stalwart Charger in the Swaps in his first start on the main 
track, will probably race next in the Travers Aug. 18 at Saratoga. . . . Annual 
Date, who was scratched from the San Diego, is being pointed for the Longacres 
Mile later this month. . . . Quiet American paid $9.40 to win and the victory 
was worth $89,800 for his owner, Sheik Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. . . . 
The final time of 1:40 2/5 was only two-fifths of a second off Windy Sands' 
28-year-old track record for 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
With the scratch of Predecessor, there's a field of six for today's La Jolla 
Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the turf. Besides Itsallgreektome, the other 
3-year-olds set to go are Green's Leader, Music Prospector, Forest Glow, Barton 
Dene and Tight Spot. 
</P>

COOPER COULD BE LATEST LAKER WITH A NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Cooper, a key performer in Showtime for more than a decade, may have 
finally run out of time. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers reportedly have told the 34-year-old guard that he might not be back 
for a 13th season, that he could be traded or put on waivers. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Corriere Dello Sport, an Italian newspaper, reported that Il 
Messaggero Roma of the Italian league has offered Cooper a $900,000-a-year 
contract. The paper, as well as La Gazzetta dello Sport, reported the deal 
hinged on whether the Lakers would match the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"But (the deal) can be considered a sure thing and will be announced early next 
week," Corriere Dello Sport reported. 
</P>
<P>
Team president Carlo Sama was quoted as saying: "He could be the right man for 
Messaggero.Because of American rules, we have to wait a few more days. " 
</P>
<P>
Contacted at his home Saturday, Cooper responded that "as far as I know, I'm 
still a Laker. I heard these rumors about Italy earlier this year and nothing 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Laker General Manager Jerry West is on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
His assistant, Mitch Kupchak, said the team has "never considered Michael 
Cooper expendable. He's been a true-blue Laker as far back as I can remember. 
We plan on having him back next year. He's under contract and we fully expect 
him to play." 
</P>
<P>
Would that mean he would not be traded? 
</P>
<P>
"We look at every situation as it comes up," Kupchak said. "That (Cooper's 
departure) would be a decision Michael Cooper would make along with Dr. (Jerry) 
Buss." 
</P>
<P>
West has indicated he'd like to make a deal before the start of training camp. 
Rumors have run through the summer that the Lakers, despite a league-high 63 
victories last season, are ready to break up the team of the '80s to build a 
team for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Lakers traded forward Orlando Woolridge to the Denver Nuggets for 
two draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of Woolridge and, perhaps, Cooper, could free up money the club 
might need under the salary cap to obtain a high-priced player. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, known for his Coop-a-Loops early in his career, game-breaking 
three-pointers in the later years and tough defense throughout, is one of two 
remaining Lakers to have played throughout the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson is the other. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, of course, will be back. At this point, no other player can say that

EDBERG, CHANG REACH FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stefan Edberg stared straight at the bright sun when he tossed the ball to 
serve, his eyes wide open. 
</P>
<P>
Then, "sometimes, you're almost half-blind when you come to the net," Edberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, you just close your eyes, and you can almost see Edberg serve 
and volley in another final. He got to his sixth of the year on a sunny 
Saturday at UCLA, where he defeated 18-year-old Pete Sampras, 6-2, 6-7 (7-2), 
6-1, in the semifinals of the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Just to prove there is nothing new under the sun, Edberg will play Michael 
Chang in today's final, their sixth meeting in less than two years. Edberg has 
won three of the previous five. 
</P>
<P>
Under the lights, Chang defeated Gary Muller, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, in their Saturday 
semifinal. It was a match interrupted slightly when someone watching apparently 
fell from a tree beyond the grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
Muller could have prevented the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I had a spare ticket if anyone needed it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Chang, Muller had too many spare errors -- 35 of them. Coupled with his 
failure to break Chang's serve, Muller was constantly frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to the stage where I wanted to catch it and throw it over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was resilient. He saved a set point in the first set when he caught 
Muller leaning the wrong way on a passing shot, allowed only 11 points on his 
serve and reached his second final in two weeks. Chang won at Toronto last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Because he played at night, Chang's day was free, so he used part of it to 
watch Edberg. Chang's reaction: "Impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's victory was as much a matter of experience over youth as anything. It 
was a curious matchup of poise and power. 
</P>
<P>
There was Sampras, knocking his serve in at speeds up to 113 m.p.h. Edberg 
countered with simple strategy. 
</P>
<P>
He won the first set on the fifth set point with a first serve of only 73 
m.p.h., the ball dropping to the court as if it were coming by parachute. 
Sampras mistimed his return and pushed the ball long. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to mix it up," Edberg said. "It was just a matter of thinking out 
there a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras has moved swiftly through the rankings to No. 15, his pace quickened by 
a rapidly maturing serve-and-volley game. Down a break in the second set, 
Sampras got it back, forced a tiebreaker and then closed it out in a hurry to 
cause a third set. 
</P>
<P>
When Sampras tossed the ball to serve, he looked into the sun, too, but he 
couldn't see himself winning. So relieved to be in a third set with Edberg, 
Sampras said he didn't care what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Only 33 minutes later, his cares were over. He fell down two breaks, trailed, 
4-0, and already knew he had no chance. Sampras said he was merely being 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing to go down 0-3, it was basically over then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Edberg's view that Sampras hadn't really run out of gas in the third 
set. "I was out there, too," Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Sampras, who began the year ranked No. 81, Edberg said he expects a 
top-10 ranking is possible by the end of the year. But Edberg cautioned against 
expecting too much too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays unbelievable at times, and then he doesn't," Edberg said. "But that's 
normal. If he didn't, he would be in the top 10 already. He's got to give 
himself a little bit of time." 
</P>
<P>
Chang took little time, only 76 minutes, to defeat Muller, a South African who 
lives in Los Angeles and whose girlfriend, actress Ann Turkel, owns a gourmet 
takeout restaurant near the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
Like Sampras, Muller lined up behind Edberg in the final against Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to put my money on anyone, I'd put it on Edberg . . . or a house, 
condominium, mobile home, VCR," Muller said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing at home hasn't really worked for Rick Leach and Jim Pugh, the 
top-ranked doubles team, who lost to Scott Davis and David Pate in the 
semifinals, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In two other appearances at the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament, Leach and Pugh 
lost in the first round in 1988 and lost in the semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't seem to do very well here," said Pugh. 
</P>
<P>
It was Leach and Pugh's first hardcourt tournament, and they will play at 
Cincinnati and New Haven, Conn., before the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a setback, it's just a little disappointing," Pugh said.

PRO FOOTBALL: THEY PLAY SAINTS TODAY IN LONDON IN THE AMERICAN BOWL, WHICH HAS 
SURVIVED FOR FIVE YEARS, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE NOVELTY HAS WORN OFF. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They miss "the Fridge" out at Wembley, and the circulation of Touch Down, 
England's only weekly on American football, is less than half the 53,000 it hit 
a few years back, but sports entrepreneurs and analysts say the gridiron, as 
many non-Americans still call American football, has finally taken firm hold in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way, it'll never be a No. 1 sport in England," said Keith Webster, 
a British sportswriter and long-time American football enthusiast. "It'll never 
compete with soccer. But four years on, American football has achieved a solid, 
hard-core following, and it is certainly a sport that is here to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as London prepared for today's fifth American Bowl -- this year 
matching the Raiders and the New Orleans Saints in an NFL exhibition game -- 
there has been little of the hype and hoopla that accompanied football's 1986 
London debut, which brought Jim McMahon's larger-than-life Chicago Bears and 
America's Team, the Dallas Cowboys, to an electrified and overflowing Wembley 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
There have been the obligatory television commercials on the BBC and poster 
campaigns in the London Underground, but the thrill of something new and 
different that brought an instant cult following to the sport in its first few 
years here has been dimmed by time in a nation where football means soccer. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, soccer continued to dominate London's sports news throughout the week, 
buoyed by Britain's unexpectedly strong performance in the World Cup, where it 
reached the semifinals, and the recent decision that its "hooligan" fans 
finally were well enough behaved to permit English clubs back into European 
soccer competition. Not a single mainstream British daily carried an advance 
story on today's football match, as they call it here. 
</P>
<P>
For Lance Cone and other veteran American football enthusiasts, part of the 
problem is simply the faddishness of professional sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no heroes here in sport seven years ago," said Cone, an American 
expatriate credited with introducing the game in London then. "We were doing 
poorly in soccer, getting killed in rugby, and American football is the kind of 
sport that creates heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"This glamorous sport just came along with bigger-than-life heroes like 
Refrigerator Perry and Jim McMahon, and it took off -- especially with the 
kids, who instantly began worshiping these new imported heroes." 
</P>
<P>
But now, with England again competitive in the world soccer arena, American 
football is finally settling in with a limited, yet enthusiastic, following. 
Cone is chairman and managing director of the British American Football Assn., 
which oversees several amateur teams playing throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The American Bowl, of course, is something else again, according to Wembley's 
deputy director and chief executive, Jarvis Astaire, who confidently predicted 
Friday that today's game will be a sellout despite the slight drop in popular 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"American football, you see, is still really an event for most of the fans who 
come to the Bowl," he said. "People don't go to the Bowl to see a match, as 
they would a soccer match. They come for a big event. So you find that American 
football attracts a more affluent audience that admires the scientific aspects 
of the game. And there will always be an audience for that here in England." 
</P>
<P>
Astaire is certainly betting on it. During a news conference Friday, Astaire 
joined with the movers and shakers in the new World League of American Football 
in announcing that Wembley will be the home of England's franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The league also announced "Operation Discovery," a year-long recruitment 
program that hopes to draft 50 top athletes from around the world to be trained 
in the finer points of American football and ultimately join the league's 12 
teams, which will consist mostly of American players. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is to spread American football all over the world," declared Joe 
Bailey, the former Cowboy executive who is vice president and chief operating 
officer of the NFL-created league, which is expected to begin play next March. 
</P>
<P>
The league will have eight franchises in North America and four in Europe, 
where teams will be based in London, Barcelona, Spain, Frankfurt, Germany, and 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
Already armed with contracts for television coverage by ABC-TV and the USA 
cable network, as well as plans for similar coverage by networks in Mexico, 
Canada, Europe and Japan, the league also is gambling that football's 
once-a-year-success phenomenon pioneered in London will spread in what Bailey 
called "the globalization" of football. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans such as Webster, though, remain a bit skeptical. This summer, he said, 
is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
"Just notice how even American attention is no longer focused on Wembley this 
summer," he said. "This summer, all eyes are on Berlin. Now the 1990 Rams are 
no more exciting than the Raiders or the Saints, but American football in 
Berlin? Now that's a story. That's a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm saying is, that some novelty has worn off a bit here in England, and 
maybe our fans are looking for something new and different again." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today's game will be televised by NBC at 10 a.m., PDT. . . . Wide receiver 
Willie Gault is doubtful because of a groin injury. Sam Graddy is expected to 
start in his place. Dennis Price will start at left cornerback in place of 
Terry McDaniel, sidelined with a hamstring injury. . . . The Raiders resume 
training camp at Oxnard on Tuesday.

HALL OF FAME CAN'T ANSWER BASEBALL'S BIG QUESTION

The first thing you learn at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is 
that real fans don't take lunch breaks. 
</P>
<P>
About half-past noon, the main exhibit hall on the museum's first floor is 
teeming with activity. For one day, visitors are taking their nourishment from 
bats, balls and the other 6,000 items that tell a remarkable story. 
</P>
<P>
A young couple and their two children are watching a TV monitor, and being 
thoroughly entertained by Abbott and Costello's hilarious "Who's On First?" 
comedy routine. A few steps away, visitors are clustered around "The Three 
Umpires," Norman Rockwell's classic painting of the stone-faced arbiters braced 
against some industrial-strength rain drops. Hanging in a place of prominence 
are 6- to 7-foot-long banners emblazoned with the photographs of Jim Palmer and 
Joe Morgan, the 205th and 206th inductees into baseball hallowed Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It's baseball as you've probably never experienced it. Baseball in Sensurround. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Hall of Fame and Museum is an impressive repository of baseball 
history, not to mention a mighty tourist attraction. When it opened for 
business in 1939, the museum welcomed more than 25,000 visitors, and, as 
recently as 1984, yearly attendance hovered just above 200,000. But several 
years ago, the explosion in baseball's popularity finally reached this remote 
country outpost in upstate New York. In 1989, visitors to the Hall topped 
410,000, with the majority coming during the peak months of June, July and 
August. 
</P>
<P>
They might have come to see the jersey worn by Orel Hershiser in the fifth game 
of the 1988 World Series, Bo Jackson's cap from the 1989 All-Star Game or 
Mickey Mantle's Yankee Stadium locker. They're all here. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe they made the pilgrimage hoping to pick up a handy fact or two about 
the game. Like the young boy in a Red Sox cap who stood in front of a display 
case that held items belonging to the dynastic Yankees of the 1940s, '50s and 
'60s. Among the treasures was a fielder's glove and a pair of spikes used by 
Phil Rizzuto, the famous shortstop turned TV pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
As he stood beside the window, the boy made a startling discovery. Then, in a 
tone of utter astonishment, he asked his dad, "You mean the guy from The Money 
Store ... was a baseball player?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the museum is full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
It's also an excellent place to go in search of baseball's origins and secrets, 
the trouble being that most of the deepest secrets have to do with who gave us 
baseball in the first place and, most important, where. There is no shortage of 
theories on this point. Ask the citizens of Hoboken, N.J., who recently 
proclaimed their town "The real birthplace of baseball," and hired a 
public-relations firm to convince the rest of us. But if you're interested in 
making friends during your visit to Cooperstown, only one answer will do. 
</P>
<P>
The historians pretty much agree now that there isn't a baseball birthplace and 
that there almost certainly wasn't a first baseball game. Instead, baseball 
probably evolved slowly during the 1830s and '40s from a game known as 
"Townball" that was played in any number of cow pastures where men gathered 
with their bare hands and handlebar mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Cooperstown has been recognized as the cradle of baseball since the 
early 1900s, when A.G. Spalding, the sporting-goods manufacturer, suggested a 
commission be appointed to resolve the question of baseball's birth once and 
for all. In 1907, the seven-member panel announced its decision, which was that 
the first game was played here and that it had been created in largest part by 
one Abner Doubleday, a Civil War hero and a career military officer. 
</P>
<P>
The commission considered lengthy testimony from a number of sources, but its 
conclusion was based largely on the recollections of a man named Abner Graves, 
an elderly mining engineer, who reported that baseball had been "invented" by 
Doubleday between 1839 and 1841. Doubleday wasn't in a position to either 
confirm or deny this; he'd died in 1893 in Mendham, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
In reporting its findings, the commission outlined its reasons for finding that 
Cooperstown was the birthplace of baseball, and praised its star witness, 
referring to Graves as a "reputable gentleman." But years later, there's more 
reason than ever to challenge both conclusions. Among them: About 20 of 
Doubleday's journals survive, but none mentions baseball; Graves was 5 and 
Doubleday 20 when the former claimed the two were classmates; in his final 
years, Graves was judged criminally insane after he shot and killed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum doesn't answer the question of baseball 
origins any more convincingly than Graves did. But there are fascinating 
exhibits that speak to the game's earliest chapters. In the Cooperstown Room, 
on the museum's ground floor, is a glass case containing the museum's first 
acquisition -- a brown, bruised, crudely shaped baseball literally bursting out 
of its seams. Steven C. Clark Sr., one of Cooperstown's richest and most 
civic-minded citizens, bought the ball for $5 from another local who claimed it 
was one of those used by Doubleday and the boys. Ball in hand, Clark began 
pitching the idea of a baseball museum to a skeptical baseball Commissioner 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who began to see the genius of the idea only when 
Clark offered to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Under the heading of relics, there's a gem in the display that traces the 
evolution of baseball equipment. It's the original catcher's mask, invented in 
1876 by the captain of the Harvard College baseball team. While it won't win 
any beauty contests, the mask is a first, and firsts are a rare thing even in 
this building. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Clark, the Hall of Fame's registrar, considers this one of the museum's 
most precious possessions because "it's one of the few things in the collection 
that you actually can point to as the first, the start of all catcher's masks." 
He pauses to consider the enormity of it. "It's almost like seeing the first 
baseball," Clark said. "If such a thing existed, can you imagine how 
overwhelming that would be?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark is one of the museum executives who shoulder the heavy responsibility of 
deciding what new items should be added to the collection. The group, which 
also includes the museum's librarian and curator, meets each Friday to discuss 
letters and calls that have come in with offers of everything from Babe Ruth 
autographed baseballs to a 1925 Hudson automobile whose owner claimed it 
belonged to Ty Cobb. Most offers (the museum does not purchase items) are 
politely turned down on the grounds that the museum already is well-stocked in 
that area. Balls signed by Ruth are particularly plentiful -- Clark estimated 
the museums owns 50 to 60 balls with his signature -- and more are offered 
almost every week. "There's so many out there, it kind of makes you wonder how 
he had time to play baseball," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum accepted 373 items last year, including 15 autographed baseballs, 
four uniforms and five items that fall under the heading of "books and 
publications." Among those gifts was a letter to Jackie Robinson from Sen. John 
F. Kennedy dated July 1, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Items high on the museum's wish list are old uniforms, especially if they date 
back to the 19th century. "If we could come up with something going back to the 
Cincinnati Red Stockings period, that would be a real coup," Clark said. That's 
not as much of a long shot as it may sound. Three years ago, a man from Ohio 
phoned the museum with an offer of six Chicago Cubs uniforms from 1909, 
including one that had belonged to Hall of Famer Frank Chance. The man's 
grandfather had been a florist in Chicago, and the players, many of whom were 
customers, presented them as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's executives use a rigorous system of checks and double checks to 
satisfy themselves that all the items they accept are the real thing. First, 
they examine the items closely. After you've seen Ruth's signature a couple 
hundred times, it's not too difficult to spot a phony. When it becomes 
necessary, they also quiz the donors to determine things like where they 
obtained the item and from whom. If they don't get the right answers, the gift 
isn't accepted. That's what happened with the Cobb car. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the matter of authenticity is trickier than others. On the first 
floor, in the east wing, most of one wall is given over to a display of 
baseballs from no-hit games dating back to Bob Feller's no-no (Cleveland 1, 
Chicago 0) on April 16, 1940. Most of the balls are autographed, and on some 
the winning pitcher also has scrawled the final score and date. 
</P>
<P>
The problems come in determining just what balls you are looking at. Clark says 
the museum tries to get the last ball used in the game because "there's 
something about the last pitched ball that people will ooh and aah about." But 
it isn't always successful in doing that, according to a random poll of two 
no-hit pitchers who live in the Baltimore area. The museum has the ball used to 
record the last out of Rex Barney's no-hitter. The Baltimore Orioles 
public-address announcer, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1940s, 
vividly recalls being asked to autograph the ball for display at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Palmer, on the other hand, says the only place his no-hit ball is on 
display is in his garage -- it's in a plastic bag, along with a baseball from 
his 1966 World Series victory over Sandy Koufax. The most likely explanation is 
that the museum received a ball -- but not THE ball -- from his big game. 
</P>
<P>
There are no doubts about what you are seeing in a special room on the first 
floor, the one with the cathedral ceiling and the bronze faces on the walls. 
The Hall of Fame gallery is quieter than most places in the museum. It's the 
kind of place that makes people think about removing their hats, or maybe 
taking off their shoes. Something about being in the company of Ruth's plaque 
-- or the plaques of Walter "Big Train" Johnson or, yes, Brooks Calbert 
Robinson Jr. -- has that effect on a baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, they'll add two more faces to the collection.

U.S. SPORTS ARE PUSHED TO THE EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
BETTING: GAMBLERS' QUEST FOR INSIDE INFORMATION BECOMES MORE AGGRESSIVE -- AND 
MORE SOPHISTICATED. THEY PREY ON VULNERABLE ATHLETES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BRUBAKER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of Pete Rose's expulsion from baseball for betting and George 
Steinbrenner's admission that he gave $40,000 to a gambler, sports and law 
enforcement officials say they are concerned about the growing influence of 
gambling on college and professional leagues. 
</P>
<P>
While a sporting event being fixed remains their greatest fear, league 
officials say they are grappling with a more everyday concern: that gamblers 
and bookmakers -- some with ties to organized crime families -- are approaching 
athletes to gather information that would be useful in formulating bets and 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
"Gamblers are more aggressive now," said Kevin Hallinan, security director of 
Major League Baseball. "They're trying to get closer to the athletes and to 
people who work within the game. I'm very much concerned about that trend. . . 
. It is a very scary thing." 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, unwitting celebrities have been used to gain access to major 
league players and umpires, Hallinan said. One gambler lured a player to a 
party by telling him a celebrity wanted to meet him, and in other instances 
players have received gifts from gambling figures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called 'the edge,' " Hallinan said of the gamblers' motives. "And the 
edge is that little piece of information from somebody inside that locker room, 
be it a player, a clubhouse guy, an umpire. Gamblers believe that, no matter 
how small the information, that edge is going to put them over the top." 
</P>
<P>
Said Warren Welsh, the National Football League's security director: "Gamblers 
aren't only interested in injuries or learning the game plan. They want to know 
if a player has financial woes or family problems because these can have an 
adverse influence on a player's performance." 
</P>
<P>
Pro and college sports personnel are forbidden by their leagues from 
associating with gamblers and from betting on their respective sports. While 
gambling has long cast a shadow over the sports world, the last 12 months have 
been notably dark.

Rose, then-manager of the Cincinnati Reds, placed bets -- directly or through 
intermediaries -- with bookmakers who had ties to organized crime families in 
Illinois, Massachusetts and New York, according to Hallinan. In basketball, 
former North Carolina State star Charles Shackleford has been accused in a 
report on ABC-TV of fixing games, an accusation he has denied. In football, 
former athletes at Texas, Arkansas, Florida and Mississippi State have been 
investigated for alleged gambling activities. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees' principal owner, said he paid admitted 
gambler Howard Spira to keep him from revealing damaging information about 
former club employees. Spira said he accepted $40,000 from Steinbrenner in 
return for detrimental information about outfielder Dave Winfield, with whom 
Steinbrenner was feuding. Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has ordered 
Steinbrenner to relinquish his majority ownership of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Sports gambling is a flourishing business. In Nevada, $1.35 billion was wagered 
legally on sports during the last fiscal year, and sources say as much as $100 
billion is bet illegally in the United States each year. With more money than 
ever at stake, gamblers and bookmakers have become increasingly adept at 
gathering information about athletes and teams, according to league and law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The bookmaker knows more about some teams than some of the coaches do when 
they prepare for another team," said Tom French, 
</P>
<P>
an FBI supervisory agent who works closely with college and pro teams. "The 
bookmaker has a network. He can pick up the phone, and if he needs to know 
what's going on in a locker room, he has somebody who can find out. Whether 
it's a ballplayer who has a marital problem or narcotics problem, these are all 
factored into the line." 
</P>
<P>
Hallinan and Welsh said gamblers have long attempted to contact athletes at 
bars and restaurants. "But now the approaches are more sophisticated," Welsh 
said. Gamblers are "going into the nicer restaurants and nicer clubs, engaging 
athletes in conversations, buying them drinks, buying them dinner, doing favors 
for their girlfriends and wives." 
</P>
<P>
When he became baseball's security director in 1986, after 25 years with the 
New York Police Department, Hallinan said he was surprised by the "numbers of 
people who were trying to infiltrate professional baseball and professional 
sports" and by the "tactics they used to try to get close to athletes." 
</P>
<P>
In the last several years, Hallinan said, gamblers and bookmakers have used 
unwitting movie stars, television personalities, professional wrestlers and 
country and western recording artists to establish relationships with players 
and umpires. 
</P>
<P>
After relationships were formed, gamblers and bookmakers invited the players 
and umpires to dinner, even sent gifts to their children, Hallinan said. Most 
of these gambling figures have ties to organized crime families, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the athletes and umpires were questioned about injuries and players' 
personal lives. "Some pretty far-out questions have been asked," Hallinan said, 
declining to name the athletes and umpires he said have been approached. 
</P>
<P>
Professional teams issue regular injury reports, partly to minimize the amount 
of so-called inside information available to gamblers. But inside information 
still is available because players do not report all of their ailments and 
injuries to trainers and coaches, league officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're looking at things like sore arms," Hallinan said. "Or a guy's got a 
pulled muscle. He doesn't want to come out of the lineup. He's starting to go 
downhill. His average is starting to drop. So nobody knows (about the ailment). 
He's keeping it a secret." 
</P>
<P>
"You just have a lot of players who are just very, very competitive, and 
they're going to play with a great deal of pain," Welsh said. "And sometimes 
those players playing in pain just aren't quite as effective as a well player 
would be. That's not always going to come out on an injury report, but that 
information certainly would be a key to somebody who is gambling on the game." 
</P>
<P>
At the college level, player injuries are not routinely announced by football 
and basketball teams. But college injuries rarely remain hidden from gamblers, 
according to Michael Roxborough, a Las Vegas oddsmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Roxborough said he often phones reporters to gather information on college 
teams. "If I need to find out about injuries, beat writers are the best to 
call," he said. "Sometimes I tip them off to stories they don't know, so I'm 
doing them a favor, too." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Levin, public relations director for Major League Baseball, said some 
reporters are betting on games they cover. "It goes on a lot . . . reporters 
talk about bets they've made, how much money they've won or lost," he said. 
"And on occasion (they) call from a press box phone to a bookmaker." 
</P>
<P>
Last year the baseball commissioner's office took the unusual step of revoking 
the credentials of two news media representatives who were observed gathering 
information in clubhouses, then using stadium phones to place bets, Hallinan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We caught them in the act (at ballparks), putting their action in," he said. 
"They were extremely embarrassed about it. . . . They said they just got 
carried away." Hallinan declined to name the reporters or specify whether they 
are employed in the print or broadcast media. 
</P>
<P>
Chet Forte, a former director of ABC-TV's "Monday Night Football," recently 
acknowledged having an addiction to sports gambling. Terry O'Neil, NBC Sports 
executive producer, said in his book, "The Game Behind the Game," that he once 
observed Forte phoning a bookmaker from the ABC director's truck. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing worries league security officials more than the threat of a fix. Dozens 
of college basketball games were fixed during the 1950s and '60s. In 1981 a 
Boston College basketball player was convicted for his role in a point-shaving 
plot that was backed by the Lucchese crime family. In 1985 several Tulane 
basketball players and students pleaded guilty to participating in a 
point-shaving scheme. 
</P>
<P>
In February, ABC-TV reported that an alleged New Jersey gambler Robert Kramer 
III paid Shackleford and three unidentified former North Carolina State 
basketball players to shave points in as many as four games during the 1987-88 
season. Kramer and Shackleford have denied the allegations, which reportedly 
are being examined by a New Jersey grand jury and the North Carolina State 
Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Schettler, who directs one of the largest Las Vegas betting operations, 
the Stardust Hotel Race and Sports Book, said he doubts a fix occurred because 
no extraordinary amount of money was bet on the suspected games. "We would know 
if something's wrong," he said. "There was nothing wrong. It's as simple as 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford is now a forward with the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Bettman, NBA senior vice president and general counsel, said his league 
isn't particularly worried about fix attempts. "Relative to what our players 
make, I don't know that there's enough money that could cause one of our 
players to fix a game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some sports and law enforcement officials said soaring salaries do not 
eliminate the possibility of a fix, especially in view of increased drug and 
gambling activity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst-case scenario is that an athlete who's a drug abuser becomes 
indebted to his drug source and can't pay," said Welsh, a former FBI agent. 
"The athlete then gets that little knock on the door at 2 some morning, and 
he's told: 'Now you have two employers. One may be your football team but the 
other is us.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest (gambling) concern of the FBI and probably all the professional 
and college leagues is the potential use of bribery or extortion to compromise 
an athlete," French said. "Three areas we concentrate on are money, narcotics 
and women. These are the areas we feel an athlete could be most vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Those in the Las Vegas gambling community disdain talk of fixes or 
organized-crime involvement in their business. "The crap about bookmakers 
breaking people's legs if they don't pay, that's all bull," said Billy Walters, 
a self-described high-stakes bettor and former bookmaker. "That might have 
happened 20 years ago. But it hasn't happened in the last 20 years that I've 
been involved." 
</P>
<P>
Some federal law enforcement officials disagree, and they point to recent court 
cases. In December of 1988, for example, an alleged associate of the Genovese 
and Gambino organized crime families, Vincent Matturro of Scarsdale, N.Y., was 
arrested on charges he operated a multimillion-dollar football betting ring. 
Several days later Matturro was found dead, hanging from a rope in the garage 
of his home. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the alleged leaders of a New York sports gambling and loan-sharking 
operation were indicted on charges they threatened bodily harm to bettors who 
didn't repay loans. A representative of the defendants set fire to one man's 
car and threatened to break another's legs, the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Welsh said organized-crime figures have attempted to make inroads with NFL 
players in "very limited situations." Horace Balmer, NBA security director, 
declined to be interviewed, referring all questions to Bettman. Asked about 
possible ties between gamblers and NBA club and league personnel, Bettman said: 
"I don't want to comment. . . . The whole issue is sensitive. I don't want to 
fuel speculation. . . . We have not had any gambling problems, and we're proud 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Rose scandal, leagues have taken steps to distance 
themselves from gambling. "The leagues realize gambling has the potential to 
destroy the golden goose," French said. "Once the public's confidence is shaken 
by a scandal or two, the game could go down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent flexed his muscles in Washington recently, warning that a proposed 
sports lottery game could reduce the city's chances of getting an expansion 
franchise. Several days after Vincent's statement, the D.C. Council voted to 
block creation of a sports lottery game. 
</P>
<P>
After learning Rose had placed bets from ballparks, Vincent ordered clubs to 
log phone calls to and from clubhouses and umpires' locker rooms. Earlier, the 
commissioner's office barred nonessential personnel from clubhouses. "Once you 
get burned, you start closing the doors," Hallinan said. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA has filed suit against the organizers of a state sports lottery in 
Oregon. "Our players have been on record as saying they don't want to be bet on 
like horses," Bettman said. And the NFL has notified five television networks 
it does not want gambling-oriented information on game-day telecasts. Welsh 
said the TV betting segments created a perception that "the NFL condoned 
betting." 
</P>
<P>
One apparent double standard remains: While NFL players are forbidden from 
betting on games, even in Las Vegas, the league allows hotel owner Barron 
Hilton, whose Las Vegas Hilton houses a sprawling sports bookmaking operation, 
to remain a minority owner of the San Diego Chargers. Welsh said NFL 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will review Hilton's ownership status. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and club officials can't plead ignorance to the subject of gambling. 
Since 1982, FBI agents have been making annual visits to college and pro teams, 
warning them of the pitfalls of this activity. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents have warned players repeatedly since the mid-1980s that a woman, 
posing as a fashion model or portrait artist, has lured dozens of college and 
pro athletes to hotel rooms and, in some instances, drugged and photographed 
them in compromising positions, according to law enforcement sources. 
</P>
<P>
Based on an unrelated case, a federal warrant has been issued in Cleveland for 
the arrest of a man who has assisted the woman and who allegedly has had sex 
with an athlete, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're hoping to blackmail athletes, trying to gain some benefits from them 
down the road," said Frank Torpey, security director of the NHL. "The most 
likely benefits would be to obtain inside information on teams or to eventually 
alter the outcome of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Welsh: "We're certainly aware of it, and (NFL) players' names have come 
up. They had lists of people who were on their kind of hit list. Most of these 
scams seem to be aimed at getting money from a person. But there's no reason it 
couldn't be used -- attempted, at least -- to influence the outcome of a 
contest." 
</P>
<P>
Some associations between sports and alleged gambling figures seem inevitable. 
For example, two newspapers and a Detroit television station reported in June 
that a close friend of Piston guard Isiah Thomas is a target in an FBI gambling 
investigation. The friend, Imad Denha, is a former neighbor of Thomas' and the 
godfather of Thomas's son, Joshua. Thomas is not a suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas's NCAA championship basketball players can scarcely visit a 
fast-food restaurant without meeting a gambler. Not only is sports gambling 
legal in Las Vegas, some of UNLV's most prominent boosters, including Steve 
Wynn, owner of the Mirage and Golden Nugget hotels, operate legal sports books. 
</P>
<P>
"If the kids are betting and stuff like that, you know, that's bad," UNLV Coach 
Jerry Tarkanian said. "But to go out and have dinner with a guy who works in a 
casino, what the hell. That's his livelihood. There's nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
One gambler who seemed harmless to Tarkanian was Sam Perry, a New York 
summer-league coach who gambled in Las Vegas. Perry helped support one Rebel 
recruit, befriended at least two others and was seen in 1987 around the UNLV 
basketball coaches' offices. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV players later learned that Sam Perry was really Richard Perry, a 
twice-convicted sports fixer. "We don't encourage our athletes to interact with 
people with unsavory backgrounds," Brad Rothermel, UNLV athletic director, said 
recently. "But how do you prevent it? You know, it's virtually impossible to 
follow 15 student-athletes every hour of the day." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL won't soon forget former Baltimore and Indianapolis Colt quarterback 
Art Schlichter, who was suspended by the league in 1983 after he reportedly 
totaled $750,000 in gambling debts. Schlichter underwent treatment for a 
gambling addiction and was arrested on illegal gambling charges four years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Schlichter, who entered another treatment center last fall, now quarterbacks 
the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football league. At 30, he said he dreams of 
returning to the NFL. This spring he was observed betting on sporting events in 
Las Vegas hotels, according to Welsh and Nevada gambling sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody said if you're ever looking for Art Schlichter, all you have to do is 
go to the Stardust," Welsh said. "With no mask or anything else, I guess he was 
just hanging out there. Art's had his problems." Schlichter could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, FBI agents will return to NFL training camps for their annual 
lectures. French said he will warn players of the federal penalties for fixing 
games and of the scams being attempted by gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go into the specifics of different (scams), it seems to ring a bell 
with the athletes," French said. "The light goes on in their heads. They say, 
'Geez, I remember that happening when I was on the road in Detroit or Cleveland 
or Buffalo.' " 
</P>
<P>
For those who cannot relate, or who believe his lecture is much ado about 
nothing, French will display a newspaper clipping that appeared the day after 
Rose was banned from baseball. "I think the headline sends a pretty strong 
message," French said. 
</P>
<P>
The headline reads: 
</P>
<P>
THE SAD END.

WOULD YOU BELIEVE THE SANTA CLARA GIANTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICK PETERS, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They don't call them the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
They don't call them the Arlington Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA champions aren't known as the Auburn Hills Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
In the NFL, they're not the Foxboro Patriots, the Irving Cowboys, the Pontiac 
Lions or the East Rutherford Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, must they be called the Santa Clara Giants? 
</P>
<P>
From a provincial standpoint, it's understandable why the folks in the Santa 
Clara Valley want their name on the major-league sports map. Surely, there's 
more to life than cultivating prunes, peaches and computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clara Giants? It has a minor-league ring to it. Can you imagine the 
snickering when the National League West standings list Santa Clara with Los 
Angeles, Atlanta and Cincinnati? 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Giants owner Bob Lurie has consented to the name change. Spurned by 
San Francisco, he simply will take his toy down the street and change its name. 
That surely will shake up the boys in the financial district. 
</P>
<P>
What did anyone expect Lurie to do? He has no choice, other than selling to 
owners who would move the Giants much farther away than Santa Clara. If he 
wants to keep the team in his beloved Bay Area, he would agree to call them 
anything -- perhaps even the Milpitas Giants or the Saratoga Giants. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a ridiculous idea. This is a regional baseball team, and it deserves 
better than to be named after a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
If a change must be made -- and that's a reasonable assumption given the fact 
that San Francisco doesn't care that much about its baseball team -- why not at 
least give it a regional identity? Something like Bay Area Giants or Redwood 
Giants isn't ideal, but it makes more sense. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara Councilwoman Sue Lasher, who spearheaded the Santa Clara Giants 
movement by insisting on a name change, has noble intentions. But how would her 
voters feel if such a stubborn stance cost them an opportunity for a 
major-league team? 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who isn't emotional about the issue might realize that it's far more 
important to acquire a team of such stature than to be petty and concerned 
about what it is called. 
</P>
<P>
THE RIPPER REBOUNDS -- The San Diego Padres were 1-11 in new manager Greg 
Riddoch's first 12 games before entering the weekend with a 9-3 record in their 
next 12. Much of the credit for the turnaround goes to Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
He was batting .358 with nine homers and 19 RBI in his last 24 games through 
Friday, a hot streak that has led him to announce his intention of remaining 
with the Padres despite the likelihood of being granted free agency because of 
the recent collusion ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad there are people in this organization who are patient," Clark said. 
"My priority is to stay here. I would like to be a part of this team next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who is in the final year of a $2 million contract, once again is forming 
a solid one-two punch with newcomer Joe Carter, who had seven RBI in his last 
four games through Friday. Over a longer haul, Carter has 15 RBI in 13 games 
after producing only four in his previous 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Lefferts also has contributed, bouncing back from a mid-season slump to 
register 11 1/3 scoreless innings. He also has 15 saves and has allowed only 
four of 30 inherited runners to score. 
</P>
<P>
STREAKING SABO -- While many observers expect Eric Davis to carry the 
West-leading Cincinnati Reds down the stretch, third baseman Chris Sabo 
continues to be the club's surprising offensive standout. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo homered for the fourth consecutive game Friday night, one away from Johnny 
Bench's club record, set in 1972. Sabo is among the league leaders with 27 
doubles and has a career-high 21 homers. He leads the Reds with 54 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo seems a cinch to erase the record for home runs by a Cincinnati third 
baseman. Tony Perez, later a first baseman, hit 25 home runs as the Reds' third 
baseman in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds entered play Saturday 11-14 since the All-Star break, losing 3 1/2 
games off their lead. A recent 2-10 slump has given new life to the Giants and 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has been the most notable culprit, going hitless in five of six games. 
Most of the other regulars have been hitting, however, making the Reds' lack of 
run production even more mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
NO-HITTER INEQUITIES -- When Scott Garrelts of the Giants and Doug Drabek of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates lost no-hitters with one out to go in the ninth inning 
Friday, it brought the major-league season totals to seven no-hitters and eight 
one-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
It also brought to mind that no-hitters shouldn't be awarded unless a pitcher 
goes at least nine innings, or eight if accomplished by a losing team on the 
road, as was the case with Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees last month. 
</P>
<P>
It seems unfair that pitchers receive credit for a no-hitter when a game is 
shortened by rain, as the Chicago White Sox's Melido Perez did this season. 
Many no-hitters are lost in the eighth and ninth innings. Why should those 
pitchers be penalized while others profit from inclement weather? 
</P>
<P>
AROUND THE HORN -- Kevin Mitchell has a new hobby. He enjoys watching his new 3 
1/2-inch pet boa devour mice. "I dropped a mouse into the fish tank the other 
night, and a second later, it was gone," Mitchell said. "Man, those boas are 
strong." ... With the Philadelphia Phillies and the Atlanta Braves out of their 
division races, the impact of the Dale Murphy trade Friday night was 
diminished. "Why block a deal between the Braves and the Phillies?" Giants 
general manager Al Rosen asked. One would think Murphy might have gone to a 
contender for the stretch drive. It's a strange deal to figure, and with Von 
Hayes probably shifting back to first base, Ricky Jordan's future in 
Philadelphia appears shaky. ... The Padres are 17-29 since Jeff Brantley broke 
Benito Santiago's forearm with a pitch June 14. ... Santiago began his 
rehabilitation at Triple-A Las Vegas last week and is expected back next week. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Schiraldi wants to be a starter for San Diego, and he is proving it by 
enabling the last 16 runners he has inherited to score. ... Ryne Sandberg 
entered the All-Star break with a .335 average, 24 homers and 57 RBI. Since 
then he is barely above .200 with one homer and six RBI.

CHINESE DIVER, 11, WINS GOLD MEDAL

<P>
At 4-foot-6 and 75 pounds, Fu Mingxia barely makes a ripple when she hits the 
water, but she made a big splash at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old Chinese sensation became the youngest gold medalist at the 
games Saturday night in the women's 10-meter platform at Federal Way, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can do a little better," Fu said through an interpreter. "I will try 
a little harder next time." 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe Fu is the youngest person to win a major international diving 
competition, winning the Alamo Invitational in May at Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Fu, who turns 12 on Aug. 16, took the lead on the first of the eight dives, an 
inward 1 1/2 somersault in a pike position, and never relinquished it, winning 
with 443.04 points. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Miroshina of the Soviet Union took the silver at 433.59 and teammate Inga 
Afonina got the bronze at 430.53. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Lian Williams of the United States, the 1989 World Diving Cup gold 
medalist, finished fifth at 418.23. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, extremely unhappy with her performance, said she wasn't surprised by 
Fu. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of getting used to it," she said. "They had another good diver who 
was 11 or 12 several years ago. And I was in China last June and saw a lot of 
incredibly talented 7- and 8-year-olds. It was just amazing." 
</P>
<P>
The two-time world and Olympic champion U.S. women's team moved into the 
basketball final with a 106-67 rout of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Edwards scored 19 points for the Americans (4-0), and Lynette Woodard 
and Carolyn Jones had 12 each. 
</P>
<P>
Australia beat Czechoslovakia, 64-63, in overtime in the consolation round as 
Shelley Gorman put in a layup with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Reyes of Ft.Worth won the 119-pound gold medal with a 3-2 decision over 
Serafim Todorov of Bulgaria. Reyes, a 5-foot-3 Marine, threw punches in 
flurries, applied the pressure from the opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Austin of Cincinnati also squeaked out a 3-2 decision over Dzhambulat 
Mutayev of the Soviet Union to win the 112-pound gold. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Marquez of Houston lost a 4-1 decision to Francisc Vastag of Romania in 
the 147-pound final. 
</P>
<P>
World champion Felix Savon of Cuba took a 5-0 decision over Yevgeni Sudakov of 
the Soviet Union in the heavyweight final. 
</P>
<P>
In other finals, Cuba's 132-pound world champion, Julio Gonzales, lost a 3-2 
decision to Artur Grigoryan of the Soviet Union, and Orestes Solano of Cuba 
took a 4-1 decision over Sven Ottke of West Germany at 165 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
World Cup champion Cuba won the men's volleyball bronze medal, beating the 
U.S., 15-5, 15-11, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
Italy won the gold, 9-15, 15-7, 15-7, 15-10, over the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Grzegorz Myszkowski of Poland won the gold medal in sailboarding, thanks in 
part to Scott Steele of the United States, who won the silver. Fernandez Asier 
of Spain took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Steele testified on Myszkowski's behalf at a protest hearing after Myszkowski 
was disqualified for a premature start. Myszkowski was reinstated, giving him a 
14.7-point net gain over Steele. Going into the final race, Steele had the 
lead, but finished fourth while Myszkowski was second to win by four points.

SAMPRAS LOOKS FOR THE MIDDLE; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: HE HITS HIGHS AND LOWS IN THREE-SET LOSS TO EDBERG AND SEARCHES FOR 
CONSISTENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like most 18-year-olds, Pete Sampras is a bundle of energy whose life teeters 
on an emotional roller coaster. His tennis game is much the same. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, having his best year since turning professional in 1988, dropped 
Saturday's semifinal at the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament to Wimbledon champion 
Stefan Edberg, 6-2, 6-7, (7-2), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time I play these guys in the top five, it gets easier and easier," 
Sampras said. "After a set or two, you kind of relax and play your own game." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras won his first professional tournament in February in Philadelphia, 
defeating Andres Gomez for the title. He has made it to the quarterfinals in 
three of his past five tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will mature in the years to come," said Sampras' coach, Joe Bardi. 
"He's a serve-and-volleyer and they tend to mature a little later than baseline 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"But the first priority is more consistent results. Week in and week out I want 
him to finish in the semis and win one every once in a while. The last two 
times he's done just that. You just can't hurry it. You build a tennis player a 
little at a time." 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes native started the match showcasing his 
serve-and-volley attack, beating Edberg with an array of drop volleys and 
passing shots and taking a 2-1 lead in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
His serve was keeping Edberg on the defensive and his volleys were landing in 
all the right corners. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good talent," Edberg said. "Soon, he's going to rank in the top 10. He 
has a bright future if he keeps working." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth game, however, Sampras' game changed dramatically. He never won a 
game the remainder of the set, playing as dejectedly as he looked. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a lot of careless volleys and my concentration was up and down," 
Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
The second set was as up and down as the first. But this time, Sampras came out 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 3-1 and 4-2, Sampras played superbly, coming back to tie the game, 
then winning it in a tiebreaker, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, I was so happy to be in the third, I didn't care what happened," 
Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
But just as a few good points in the second set ignited Sampras, a few bad 
shots in the third set depressed him again. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg took a 5-0 lead before Sampras finally held serve, but Edberg finished 
it with a love game.

KATERINA MALEEVA BEATS SABATINI, WILL FACE GRAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Third-seeded Katerina Maleeva defeated Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 6-4, Saturday to 
earn a berth opposite Steffi Graf in the finals of the Canadian Open in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Graf beat No. 7 Nathalie Tauziat of France, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Maleeva-Sabatini match had plenty of acrobatics and finesse. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing to lose, so I went for it," Maleeva said after her first victory 
in four career matches against Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
"Sabatini seems very strong," the 21-year-old Bulgarian said, "but at the same 
time, I've seen her lose matches because she tires." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini had a three-set struggle against Jennifer Capriati Friday night and 
completed a doubles match about an hour before her singles assignment on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva, who is winless against Graf in six matches, says she will play to 
Graf's powerful forehand today. 
</P>
<P>
"If you play to her backhand," Maleeva said, "she makes you move left, right, 
left, right until you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina beat Canadian Martin Wostenholme, 6-2, 
6-1, to reach the finals of the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships at Brookline, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Jaite will play Czechoslovakia's Libor Nemecek in the finals today. Nemecek, 
who had to go through two rounds of qualifying to enter the tournament, 
defeated Darren Cahill of Australia, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Jaite won six consecutive games during one stretch, beginning in the fifth game 
of the opening set. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's Karel Novacek continued a winning streak when he defeated 
sixth-seeded Horst Skoff of Austria, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, in the semifinals of the 
Austrian Open at Kitzbuehel. 
</P>
<P>
Novacek, ranked 37th in the world, defeated Boris Becker, 6-3, 6-3, in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the second semifinal, Horacio de la Pena of Argentina defeated Emilio 
Sanchez of Spain, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5).

MURPHY GETS HIT IN PHILLIE DEBUT, BUT PIRATES WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After making a tearful departure from Atlanta after 15 years with the Braves, 
Dale Murphy said he was excited about joining the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, once one of the most feared hitters in baseball, had a single in four 
at-bats in his debut in right field Saturday night at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Don Slaught doubled home two runs in the 10th inning to give the Pittsburgh 
Pirates a 3-1 victory and a tie for first place with the New York Mets in the 
National League East. 
</P>
<P>
A leadoff home run by Von Hayes in the bottom of the ninth sent the game into 
extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been impressed with the way things are run here," Murphy said. "I 
think there's a bright future here." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was robbed of a hit in the first when shortstop Jay Bell made a diving 
catch of his line drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little nervous," Murphy said. "After all, I was with the Braves a long 
time." DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
CLEMENS GETS SORE AT TIGERS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between starts lately, Roger Clemens has been complaining about a sore 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Once the hard-throwing right-hander of the Boston Red Sox takes the mound, 
however, the injury is forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, in improving to 15-5, threw 165 pitches in hot, humid Boston Saturday 
and beat the Detroit Tigers, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
He needed help to get the final out and his string of shutout innings ended at 
26, but he celebrated his 28th birthday with another strong performance. He had 
eight strikeouts, four against Cecil Fielder, and gave up nine hits. Rob Murphy 
came in to get the last out. 
</P>
<P>
"I pushed it a little far today," said Clemens, who had pitched consecutive 
shutouts. "I was physically drained, but mentally I was in there pretty much. I 
threw a lot of pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens gave up a run in the fourth on a one-out double by Lloyd Moseby and a 
two-out single by Gary Ward. 
</P>
<P>
He lowered his major league-leading earned-run average to 2.14 and increased 
his league-leading strikeout total to 158. 
</P>
<P>
"He's some pitcher," Manager Sparky Anderson of the Tigers said. "He pitched 
well. He did what he had to do when he had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens also impressed his catcher, John Marzano. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger wanted to stay in there and almost made it," he said. "He pitched a 
great game. He didn't have the pop early he had in the late innings, but he's a 
battler. He's just the greatest pitcher in baseball and it's an honor to catch 
him." 
</P>
<P>
A single by Larry Sheets and a two-out walk to Dave Bergman chased Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news for the Red Sox was that they lost their closer, Jeff Reardon, 
because of a ruptured disk. He will be sidelined the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
So it was left to Murphy to finish. In his first chance as the No. 1 closer, he 
needed only two pitches to get Lou Whitaker on a fly ball to end the game and 
get his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
With their sixth victory in a row and seventh in the last eight, the Red Sox 
increased their lead in the American League East to 2 1/2 games over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs, who had three hits for the third time in the last four games, 
singled home the tying run with two out in the fifth and scored after a single 
in the seventh for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The winning run scored in the sixth when rookie Steve Searcy walked Jody Reed 
with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 3, Toronto 2 -- It's probably too late for the Rangers to make a move in 
the West, but they are making life miserable for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Witt pitched a five-hitter at Arlington, Tex., for his seventh 
consecutive victory as the Rangers extended their winning streak to six games 
with their third in a row over the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Witt (10-8) had a no-hitter until the fifth and pitched his third complete game 
in 21 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Franco and Ruben Sierra each had two hits for the Rangers and Sierra 
drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays have lost four out of five and must face Nolan Ryan tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 9, Milwaukee 6 -- Sammy Sosa hit a three-run home run in a six-run 
sixth inning at Milwaukee and the White Sox won their fourth in a row. It was 
the Brewers' seventh consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Calderon hit his 11th home run of the season and his fourth home run in 
the last four nights. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Peterson went into the eighth with an 8-2 lead, but the Brewers scored 
four runs before Bobby Thigpen came in and got the last four outs and his 35th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 17, New York 3 -- Looking at the final score, it's hard to believe 
that it was a 3-3 tie going into the sixth inning at New York. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Cory Snyder hit a grand slam to break the tie and hand Tim Leary 
his 14th loss. 
</P>
<P>
Chris James hit a two-run home run in the first inning, the first home run off 
Leary in 90 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Minnesota 3 -- The Twins' Brian Harper extended his hitting streak 
to 25 games with a double in the fourth inning at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a bloop double with two out in the ninth inning by the Mariners' 
Harold Reynolds that was the key hit. Reynolds' double scored Scott Bradley 
from first base. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins had rallied for a run in the top of the ninth to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Only Ken Landreaux, who hit safely in 31 consecutive games, has had a longer 
hitting streak for the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 9, Baltimore 1 -- The Royals, battered and bruised in two previous 
games at Baltimore, turned it around. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Macfarlane hit a grand slam and drove in a career-high five runs as the 
Royals dropped the Orioles 5 1/2 games behind the Red Sox in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, who were outscored, 19-2, in the first two games, also had a home 
run from George Brett. 
</P>
<P>
Andy McGaffigan (3-0) gave up two hits in six innings to keep his record 
perfect and lower his ERA to 1.39. DAN HAFNER

COSLETT SEES GOOD THINGS IN JET SCRIMMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took the Jets' offense 33 plays to score against the Jets' defense, and at 
that point, Bruce Coslet had seen enough. Right after Mickey Shuler took a 
5-yard pass from free-agent quarterback Brent Snyder for the only touchdown of 
Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage -- and Pat Leahy added the PAT -- the Jets' 
first-year coach called a halt to the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Coslet said he "saw good things" on both sides of the field -- 
actually, both offense and defense shared the same sideline -- but acknowledged 
that the defense held a slight edge. "In half a game we only scored one 
touchdown," Coslet said, "so I guess you could say they won." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets used four quarterbacks -- in order of appearance Tony Eason, Ken 
O'Brien, Troy Taylor and Snyder -- who completed 11 of 13 passes for 131 yards. 
Snyder saw the most action, 16 plays, and Eason the least, four. O'Brien and 
Taylor were sacked once each -- not counting one apparent sack of O'Brien by 
defensive end Marvin Washington -- and until Snyder finally found Shuler for 
the scrimmage's only score, the closest the offense came to the end zone was 
Leahy's 47-yard field-goal attempt that fell short. 
</P>
<P>
"We set out to accomplish three objectives," Coslet said. "We wanted to get 
everybody some contact, we wanted to hit hard, and we wanted nobody to get 
hurt. We accomplished all three. We've still got some work to do." 
</P>
<P>
The high point offensively was supplemental draft pick Rob Moore's leaping 
catch of a Snyder pass for a 26-yard gain that set up Shuler's TD catch three 
plays later. 
</P>
<P>
As for the offensive line, which was guilty of two holding penalties, Coslet 
said, "We've got to get more consistent. We got sacked twice, but I didn't see 
the quarterbacks running for their lives on every play." 
</P>
<P>
Coslet also was pleased with a resounding collision between Erik McMillan and 
Roger Vick -- 'I think that one was a tossup on who hit who the hardest" -- and 
on the play of outside linebacker Joe Mott, who forced inside several sweeps 
for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
Coslet, however, was left with one question. "Do we praise the defense?" he 
asked, "or (knock) the offense?" 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, locked in a battle for the No. 3 quarterback job with Taylor, was the 
only quarterback to move the offense, but the second-year pro attributed that 
mostly to playing time. "When you get as many reps as I did, it's a lot 
easier," said Snyder, who completed 6 of 7 passes, including the TD pass. "It's 
a lot different being out there for real than just going through the motions in 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder laughed when told that Coslet had boasted of "throwing the rookie 
quarterbacks some curves" by calling plays they were unfamiliar with. "He did 
do that," Snyder said. "But that's OK. Coaches are allowed to do that, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who was credited with one of the defense's two sacks -- Ron 
Stallworth had the other -- thought he should have gotten credit for another 
sack on the scrimmage's sixth play, when he clearly reached O'Brien and planted 
a two-hand tag on him. But the play was allowed to continue and O'Brien 
completed a 15-yard pass to Carl Parker. "I definitely had him," Washington 
said. "Maybe I should have tackled him." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien waved off Washington's complaint. "He sacked me? You've got to be 
kidding." 
</P>
<P>
LB Troy Benson (pinched nerve in neck), WR Al Toon (strained groin), RB Johnny 
Hector (knee), LG Mike Haight (sprained right ankle) and DE Dennis Byrd 
(shoulder) did not play. Toon and Byrd will practice Monday. Benson was to be 
examined by Dr. James Nicholas Saturday and undergo further tests during the 
week. Hector, said Coslet, is "a wait-and-see story." 
</P>
<P>
Benson's injury is an old one that was aggravated when he ran head-on into 
rookie fullback Leon Perry, a 230-pounder. "It's tough to tackle with a pinched 
nerve," Benson said, "and being a linebacker, that's kind of my job."

Jerald Clark of the Las Vegas Stars tied a Pacific Coast League record Saturday 
night with home runs in four consecutive at-bats, hitting three of them to lead 
the Stars to an 8-6 victory over the Edmonton Trappers. 
</P>
<P>
Clark hit a home run in the eighth inning Friday night to give the Stars a 3-2 
victory over Edmonton, then hit solo homers in his first three at-bats Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The right-handed hitting outfielder singled home a run in his fourth and final 
at-bat in the seventh inning. He was in the on-deck circle when catcher Benito 
Santiago of the San Diego Padres, on an injury rehabilitation stint with the 
Stars, grounded into a double play to end the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The only other player in PCL history to hit home runs in four consecutive 
at-bats was Gus Zernial of the Hollywood Stars, who homered in his last two 
at-bats on May 18, 1948, and in his first two the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Schneider of Vernon set the PCL record of five home runs in one game May 
11, 1923.

Louis Willie, the first black to join Shoal Creek Country Club, site of this 
week's PGA Championship, was relaxed during his initial visit as a member, his 
wife said. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved it," Yvonne Willie said of her husband's visit to Shoal Creek in 
Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't Willie's first trip to the club, though. He was a spectator at the 
1984 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Willie, 66, an insurance executive, took a few strokes on the putting green 
Friday, three days after he received an honorary membership as part of an 
agreement that led civil rights groups to call off plans for picketing the 
previously all-white club during the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 25 years since he played golf. He wasn't able to get in a round 
because the course is closed as it gets some final touches in advance of 
Monday's opening practice round.

In another development related to Steinbrenner, the prosecutor in Spira's 
extortion trial asked baseball to delay its Steinbrenner investigation to avoid 
uncovering information that would help Spira in his defense, baseball's lawyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
John Dowd, who advised Commissioner Fay Vincent in the Steinbrenner inquiry, is 
quoted in the New York Times as saying assistant U.". attorney Gregory Kehoe 
contacted him in April with the request. 
</P>
<P>
Kehoe acknowledged asking for the delay, but he called claims that he sought to 
avoid helping Spira's defense "pure nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are required to share any information necessary for the defense to 
make its case. 
</P>
<P>
Spira is expected to be tried later in the year.

MEYER, PERKINS HEADED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT?

<P>
This is the second time around for Ray Perkins and Ron Meyer. Perkins left the 
New York Giants for Alabama in 1983. The New England Patriots fired Meyer in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Both wanted to return to the NFL in the worst way. So they took two of the 
worst jobs. Perkins went with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Meyer joined the 
Indianapolis Colts. With their personal blessings, Perkins and Meyer have let 
their owners set up their potential firings this season. The Bucs and the Colts 
once again are disasters waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
The time bomb in Indianapolis exploded this month. General manager Jimmy Irsay 
activated that bomb in April when he traded two Pro Bowl-caliber players -- 
tackle Chris Hinton and wide receiver Andre Rison -- to the Atlanta Falcons to 
put him in position to draft quarterback Jeff George. George received $2 
million a season. Disaster followed. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Chris Chandler expressed his displeasure. Halfback Eric Dickerson 
turned into a verbal terrorist. Center Ray Donaldson, the only remaining 
high-quality blocker on the offensive line, told management he had too many 
personal duties to handle to meet the Thursday reporting date. If he could, 
Donaldson would try to make camp Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Irsay and Meyer found themselves with an offense that has a raw 
quarterback, George, and an aging but versatile running back, Albert Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, Irsay totally mismanaged the Chandler affair and might 
be forced by the courts to let him escape as a free agent. The Colts refused to 
pay Chandler his $50,000 workout bonuses. Chandler attended the workouts, but 
the Colts contend that he was there in body, not spirit. Chandler sued, but his 
intent is to break his contract with the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
In the free market, Chandler could be a hot commodity. The Bucs reportedly were 
willing to give a second-round choice to the Colts to acquire Chandler as a 
backup. If he played, the Bucs would surrender a No. 1 choice next year. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler's agent, Mike Sullivan, said that former Oakland A's pitcher Catfish 
Hunter became a free agent when owner Charlie Finley fudged on a postseason 
workout payment. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a willful breach of contract," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Way to go, Jimmy. The young Colts general manager already has taken heat for 
trading away the franchise's future to acquire Dickerson, linebacker Fredd 
Young and George. 
</P>
<P>
For those three players, Irsay sacrificed four first-round and two second-round 
choices, linebacker Cornelius Bennett, Hinton and Rison. 
</P>
<P>
Young hasn't been their best linebacker, Dickerson wants out and no one knows 
whether George will be an instant star. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jimmy Irsay's father wasn't the owner of that team, no way would he be 
running it," Dickerson said. "He deserves to be a general manager about as much 
as Daffy Duck does. It's a terrible football team. They couldn't beat some of 
the worst Canadian League teams. That's how bad it is. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I thought we had a team that could go to the playoffs every 
year, but they've dismantled the team slowly but surely. With what they've got 
left, there's probably not a chance they'll win five games. Without me, it 
might be zero." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts will have trouble winning more than five or six games this year. 
Defensive end Jon Hand and linebacker Jef Herrod are expected to have long 
holdouts. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, if the Colts have the worst record in the NFL, the Falcons get 
the first choice in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Look for Meyer to get fired. 
</P>
<P>
Down in Tampa, usually cheap owner Hugh Culverhouse started spreading some 
money to players this off-season. He traded for halfback Gary Anderson. He took 
chances on top, expensive athletes in the draft who could produce big dividends 
-- namely linebacker Keith McCants and halfback Reggie Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is the Bucs' year? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm about as excited as I've ever been about any team in Tampa," Culverhouse 
said. "I predict we will go 11-5 or could go 12-4 with a few breaks. I can't 
sit here and tell you we'll be as good as any team in the league, but I think 
we will. I know we will be in the top six, seven or eight teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
But they aren't. So Perkins, who has never won more than five games in a season 
with the Bucs, should be joining the unemployment lines. Meyer and Perkins 
wanted to get back to the NFL in the worst way and they did. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Bay Packers are puzzled by the Don Majkowski negotiations. They have 
offered him a two-year, $2.4 million contract, but his agent, Randy Vataha, 
won't come down at all in his demand for $2.8 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski, who became a one-year sensation last season, wants a $3 million 
signing bonus included in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"He started out asking for the universe," Packers general manager Tom Braatz 
said. "Now, he's at Mars. I hope he comes back to Earth." 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Broncos have serious contract troubles with defensive end Ron 
Holmes. The former University of Washington defender wants $1 million a season. 
Speaking of Huskies lineman, tackle Dennis Brown, all 310 pounds of him, had a 
weight clause included in the contract he signed with the San Fransisco 49ers 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Broncos receiver Ricky Nattiel is still troubled by the cracked right kneecap 
that kept him ineffective last season. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers camp is off to a bad start. Guard Leo Goeas, a 
third-round choice, suffered a foot injury that might keep him out for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Ron Walker, who caught 24 passes as a rookie, blew out a knee and 
will miss the season. First-round choice Junior Seau won't come down from his 
$1.5-million-a-year contract demand and is buckled in for a long holdout. 
</P>
<P>
If Steve Beuerlein's holdout persists, the Raiders might sign Doug Williams for 
help. That might not be too critical, though. Jay Schroeder is having a great 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Albert Lewis is trying everything possible to 
force a trade. Last week, he criticized president Carl Peterson for having an 
Eastern, arrogant attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff George has been throwing well in the Colts camp. Some compare his throwing 
style to former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bradshaw, George puts his right index finger at the back point of the 
football. 
</P>
<P>
The trade value of Houston Oilers halfback Mike Rozier has dropped so much that 
the Eagles rejected a straight-up trade for quarterback Don McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
Eagles coach Buddy Ryan never minces words. He told Philadelphia writers that 
he wanted to steal a first-round choice from the Seahawks in a trade for 
holdout middle linebacker Byron Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said that Seahawks coach Chuck Knox was fighting for his job and needed a 
solid middle linebacker for his new 4-3 defense. What he didn't tell the 
writers was that the Seahawks weren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula is willing to take chances. In May, he signed 
cornerback Reggie Sutton, who has had a history of drug problems. Sutton had to 
be released when he failed to show up for a drug test. Last week, he added 
halfback Tony Collins, another player with a drug history. Collins has been 
impressive in camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals are expected to stay in Seattle for a week after they 
play the Seahawks Oct. 1 because they visit the Los Angeles Rams the next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos washed their hands of halfback Lorenzo Hampton by trading him to 
the Dallas Cowboys for a conditional sixth-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, a Plan B acquisition, practiced 11 days and collected $155,000 in 
signing and reporting bonuses. The Broncos aren't impressed with another 
expensive Plan B acquistion, tight end Chris Verhulst. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas loves Bart Simpson. Each day in 
practice, he's worn a different Simpson T-shirt. Among the early selections: 
"Bart is my hero"; "Bart isn't an underachiever"; "Bart can achieve anything he 
sets his mind to, good or bad"; and "Bart's a radical dude." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Eagles backup quarterback Jim McMahon is causing a stir. Each day, 
the controversial quarterback has worn a different jersey. The Eagles refused 
to give him his customary No. 9 because that belongs to holdout quarterback Don 
McPherson. The first day, McMahon wore a question mark on the back of his 
jersey. The second day he wore the No. 12 of starter Randall Cunningham. He 
followed that with Jerome Brown's No. 99. On the fourth day, he wore a black 
jersey with no number at all. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien golfed this summer with Phoenix 
Cardinals return specialist Vai Sikahema. During their round, the conversation 
turned to Timm Rosenbach, another product of the Washington State quarterback 
fraternity. "We started talking about Timm, and Mark said, 'If Timm ever gets 
his head out of the bar and into the playbook, he'll be a good quarterback,' " 
Sikahema told Phoenix reporters this week. When asked by reporters about 
Rypien's comments, Rosenbach replied bitterly, "I'm a 23-year-old single male. 
I have a life. I'm tired of it. I'm sick of the crap, everyone saying I can't 
do this and I can't do that. That's a bunch of b.s. I know I can play in this 
league. I know I can win. I'll show everybody." Rosenbach had nine completions 
in his rookie season.

THE SPIRIT OF GIVING IS DOOMING THE KINGS

<P>
Unhappy in your present job? Looking for greater opportunities? Call the 
Sacramento Kings Executive Placement Service and ask for a trade. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball team that can't help itself has become expert at helping others. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies suffer from mistrust between management and the work force. Not 
the Kings. They are positively charitable toward their employees. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings also are nice to the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Most NBA teams hate to make trades within their own conference. They don't like 
to feed the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Such selfish concerns don't trouble the Kings. In the spirit of cooperation, 
they help their Western Conference brethren year-round. They lose in the winter 
and give away their best players in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Kings' generosity, Rodney McCray and Danny Ainge will be able to 
compete for championships in Dallas and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings gave away 35 points per game while advancing the careers of McCray 
and Ainge. The Kings left their cupboard bare, but they made friends in Dallas 
and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Pervis Ellison was discouraged by the demise of his patron, Bill Russell. To 
soothe Ellison, the Kings sent him to Washington, where his agent lives and can 
hold his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings made it easy for Vinny Del Negro to research his Italian roots. They 
declined to bid against Benetton Treviso for Del Negro's future. Harold 
Pressley can go, too, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are crying for help at point guard. Don't worry. When things get 
desperate, they can walk into a fire sale and throw good money at someone like 
Nate McMillan of Seattle, Michael Adams of Denver, Mark Jackson of New York or 
Brian Shaw of the Roma/Boston Il MessaCeltics. 
</P>
<P>
After a whirlwind of trading, the Kings have produced another lineup for the 
upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
The club's public relations staff will try to pass off the new look as 
"exciting" and "unique." In truth, it's an old story, featuring less talent 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Habitual rebuilding caused the Kings' decline. Stability -- the hallmark of 
every good franchise -- is a concept the Kings don't fathom. 
</P>
<P>
Charter members of the Kings fan club will recall that Joe Axelson broke up the 
last playoff squad in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
One year later, Russell came along and tore apart Axelson's handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dick Motta is having his turn at the canvas, brushing on yet another layer 
of whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
Axelson and Russell had reasons for their trades. Motta has reasons, too. 
There's always a reason, something like, "Well, we weren't getting anywhere 
with those other guys, so we wanted to get guys with a fresh outlook." 
</P>
<P>
The team that Motta and player personnel director Jerry Reynolds are building 
this summer will have a fresh outlook for a while. New teams always enjoy a 
respite from past failures. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Pressley and Kenny Smith had fresh outlooks. Joe Kleine 
certainly had a fresh outlook, as did Ed Pinckney, Derek Smith, Jim Petersen 
and Brad Lohaus. Not long ago, Ainge's outlook was fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Losing has a way of making fresh outlooks stale. One miserable season does the 
trick. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 Kings have little chance of winning 20 games, a reality Motta 
acknowledged when he traded Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we're ready for our push, Danny will be too old to help us," Motta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone will be old when the Kings are ready. The club will resemble the 
Children's Crusade marching on the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
At center, the Kings have one arthritic malcontent (Ralph Sampson), a veteran 
who rarely left the bench in Dallas (Bill Wennington), a youngster from Utah 
who did most of his work in practice (Eric Leckner) and an unsigned rookie who 
played 2 1/2 seasons in college (Duane Causwell). 
</P>
<P>
At forward, they have two rotund scorers who dislike rebounding and are never 
without double coverage (Wayman Tisdale and Antoine Carr) and two unproven, 
unsigned rookies (Lionel Simmons and Anthony Bonner). 
</P>
<P>
At guard -- their weakest yet most important position -- the Kings have a 
32-year-old point man whom the Miami Heat considered expendable (Rory Sparrow), 
one aging defensive specialist (Bobby Hansen) and two novices who aren't really 
anything yet (Byron Irvin and Travis Mays). 
</P>
<P>
Motta can't wait for training camp to start. He promises dogfights at every 
position. 
</P>
<P>
They'll fight like dogs until Nov. 2, when the season starts. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Kings will play like puppies -- all bark, no bite.

QUANCE MOVES A BIG STEP CLOSER TO FULFILLING OLYMPIC DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING: NORTHRIDGE TEEN-AGER'S EFFORT IN LONG COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS LANDED HER 
ON A NATIONAL TEAM THIS SUMMER AND SHOULD EARN HER A BERTH IN THE '92 OLYMPIC 
TRIALS AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Until last week, Kristine Quance's Olympic goal was a secret, something she 
pondered on long, silent swims to avoid being mesmerized by the black line on 
the bottom of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
But Quance, 15, from Northridge, let the cat out of the bag last Sunday and 
Monday at the U. S. Swimming National Long Course Championships in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Although the qualifying times will not be released until the U.S. Swimming 
convention Sept. 16-23 in Pittsburgh, Quance's efforts in the 400-meter 
individual medley (4 minutes 49.52 seconds) and the 200 breaststroke (2:33.52) 
are expected to be well under the qualifying standards for the Olympic Trials 
in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, her third-place finishes in those races put her within striking 
distance of the first- or second-place performance she'll need to make the U.S. 
team that will travel to Barcelona, Spain, to compete in the Games of the XXVth 
Olympiad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kinda been in the back of my mind, but I've never told anyone," Quance 
said of her Olympic aspirations. "I still don't want to tell anyone. I don't 
want to be bragging about the Olympics, but it's a little more realistic now." 
</P>
<P>
Quance made it more realistic with a drastic improvement during the past 12 
months. Her 400 IM time was seven seconds better than her previous best and a 
whopping 15 seconds faster than her best time of a year ago. In the 200 
breaststroke, her clocking was three seconds faster than what she swam unshaved 
and unrested at the Olympic Sports Festival in Minneapolis last month, and 
seven seconds quicker than her 1989 best. 
</P>
<P>
"At her first nationals last summer at USC we weren't expecting her to make it 
and she had an awkward time," said Steve Reardon, her coach with the Valley 
Aquatic Swim Team. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second one in Nashville last March she did her best times in the 
morning (preliminaries) but she didn't come back (well) at night (in the 
finals). It was a sign that she was too excited by her morning swims. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, she had great races in the morning and she came back and made some 
adjustments and swam even better times at night. She feels like she belongs at 
this level now." 
</P>
<P>
Already Quance has earned a berth at yet another level. This weekend, she will 
make her international debut in the Legion of European Nations Cup in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty excited about going to Italy," Quance said. "I've never been 
anywhere with U.S. Swimming except Canada and Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I like traveling with swimming, I really don't have a problem getting 
homesick. It's really exciting, but it can get tiring because of the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the intimidation. Quance is still in awe of Olympian Janet Evans 
as well as Summer Sanders and Mary Ellen Blanchard, among others. But the 
difference between her first national championship meet last summer and her 
last is that now she can race with the best in the U.S. in the individual 
medley and the breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
"I kinda still do idolize them because they are so awesome, and when I first 
started going to nationals they were so much more awesome, " Quance said. "But 
now I'm getting closer and closer. I didn't really expect to place here and it 
still hasn't sunk in." 
</P>
<P>
While Quance's inexperience was painfully obvious in the 200 breaststroke, her 
talent was equally apparent. She reached the first wall ahead of the field, 
established a personal best at the 100 by turning in 1:13.00 and maintained the 
lead through 150 meters. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the more experienced Blanchard (granddaughter of Heisman trophy 
winner Doc Blanchard) and Jill Johnson passed her and Quance held on for third. 
</P>
<P>
In the individual medley, she picked up time on all four strokes, but still 
suffers from a weak backstroke leg. 
</P>
<P>
"Her backstroke is something we've worked on from Nashville (last March) until 
now," Reardon said. "It has helped her cause. She still falls behind the 
leaders, but in Nashville, she fell behind the whole field." 
</P>
<P>
On her best leg, the breaststroke, Quance makes up for lost time, but that 
takes its toll on the final freestyle portion. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes her 25 meters to recover because she goes so hard on the 
breaststroke," Reardon said. "But all those things will work out. I guarantee 
her next nationals she'll be more competitive on the backstroke and the 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she has a taste of what it's like to be in a race like that." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ed Spencer, coach of the Industry Hills Aquatic Club, it's that 
ability to race that sets her apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes athletes only do about two-thirds of what they need to do," Spencer 
said. "Some of them work hard in the pool, but up on the blocks they are not at 
all cut out for the perfect race. 
</P>
<P>
"Others are great racers, but they are not willing to pay the price in 
workouts. Kristine is going all out in workouts and weight training on her own, 
and when she gets up on the blocks, she's all business." 
</P>
<P>
Though Quance, who began swimming at age 10, has reached the age when 
boy-watching and shopping with friends compete with the early hours, cold 
temperatures and monotony of her sensory-deprivation sport, Reardon believes 
she can withstand distractions. 
</P>
<P>
For now. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't been swimming that long so everything is really fresh and new to 
her," he said. "And she's having too much fun doing what she's doing, 
especially coming to a meet like this and getting third. 
</P>
<P>
"After Nashville, she said she didn't want fifth and sixth any more, and now 
she doesn't want third. She's constantly upgrading her goals." 
</P>
<P>
Even at the risk, it appears, of someone finding out.Associated Press

RANGERS HEAD FOR WICHITA AFTER GAINING SOME RESPECT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: CINDERELLA BAND GETS INVITATION TO NBC WORLD SERIES AFTER 
NINTH-INNING RALLIES LEAD TO SECOND-PLACE FINISH IN STATE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

They drive beat-up cars that barely make it to blue-collar jobs. Their dreams 
are in minor-league hues and of major-league debuts. But the reality for the 
Valley Rangers is summer amateur baseball, because somewhere along the line 
nearly every member of the squad was overlooked or rejected by a professional 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nobody asked for credentials or lines of credit when the Rangers lined up 
last month at the Central State National Baseball Congress tournament in Santa 
Maria. And now this band of castoffs is bound for Wichita, Kan., this morning, 
and the NBC World Series. 
</P>
<P>
To become the first Valley team since the 1987 Valley Dodgers to earn an NBC 
World Series berth, the Rangers won four games in the losers' bracket of the 
central state event. 
</P>
<P>
Twice they rallied with two out in the bottom of the ninth to keep their 
Cinderella summer alive. 
</P>
<P>
Their chances in the World Series, beginning Monday against the Hays (Kan.) 
Larks, seem slim considering their first-year status. To compound matters, the 
Rangers won't be at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
Several players, including pitcher Lance Gibson and shortstops Donnie Erickson 
and Ted Weisfuss, couldn't get time off from work to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Neither could former Calabasas star Cort Wright, so he gave up his job as a 
supermarket box boy, ensuring that the Rangers would have enough pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Now Wright and most of his teammates are concerned about paying for lodging and 
meals. The Rangers got a late start raising money for the tournament because of 
a communications breakdown between local NBC officials and their national 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The national group refuted the locals' contention that the Rangers, as central 
state runners-up, were assured a berth in the World Series. Nevertheless, on 
July 27, the national organizers invited the Rangers to replace a first-place 
team that couldn't raise enough money for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers Manager Frank Des Enfants found himself in the same situation after 
scrambling for a week, without success, to find corporate sponsorship in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, half of his players were able to come up with the air fare; the 
others were still trying to borrow a van late in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"While no one has to do anything, I'm a little disappointed by the lack of 
community support," said Des Enfants. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they'd care if we were Little League. People are ignorant about NBC 
baseball. We're not a bunch of fat beer-swillers. There's nothing higher (than 
the NBC) in amateur baseball (except) the Olympics every four years." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, the 45-year-old skipper considered competitiveness, talent 
and attitude last spring when he assembled the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years you get a feel for who can play and who can't," Des Enfants 
said. "Who is a crybaby and who you want up at the plate in a clutch 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
The 33-9 Rangers cornered the market on clutch in winning nine games with 
ninth-inning rallies, some of which were inspired by infielder Dave Price. 
</P>
<P>
"He does an unbelievable impersonation of Vin Scully," said Wright. "He changes 
all the last names to big-league names like 'Cort' Canseco. He can do 
play-by-play for nine innings." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Tim de Grasse, of UC Santa Barbara via Notre Dame High, offers another 
source of amusement. The "Vulture," as he is known for swooping in amid 
late-inning rallies and claiming wins, is a blur of zany, constant chatter. 
</P>
<P>
"I make sure no one gets mad if they don't do well," De Grasse said. "I remind 
them it's not the college season or their life or their job on the line. It's 
summer ball and you gotta be loose. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're going to a place where there'll be millions of fans and scouts. 
That's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be pros," added center fielder Jason Peterson, "that's where it's 
at." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson played for Grant High in a City Section championship game at Dodger 
Stadium, but Peterson didn't get a tumble in the amateur draft following his 
senior year, much less a call from a college recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Des Enfants believes Peterson is one of several Rangers who could play at 
the Class-A level. 
</P>
<P>
Some team members already have played in the minors. Price competed in a pro 
league in Australia, and part-time catcher Andy Allanson was with the Cleveland 
Indians last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has a lot of talent," Des Enfants said. "I'm not worried when anyone 
comes up to the plate. I don't say I wish we had our No. 3 or No. 4 hitter up. 
Everyone has contributed to the late-inning rallies." 
</P>
<P>
Since many pro and college scouts are expected to be in Wichita, the World 
Series represents the late innings of these players' careers, their last chance 
to impress someone and earn the right to keep playing the game they love. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wright left his job he remembered the feeling of going from work to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get on the ball field," he said, "it's like a dreamscape. Everything 
becomes magical." 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said of the Valley Rangers' season.

BOLDEN CHASING HIS DREAM AT THE SUMMER PRO LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pat Bolden of Inglewood was a standout basketball player at Cal State 
Northridge, he set his sights high -- 10 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly seeking out the basket, Bolden finished his career with 1,081 
points, fourth in school history. The more he scored, he thought, the better 
his chances of being noticed by scouts for professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
Although undoubtedly one of the finest basketball talents ever to play at 
Northridge, Bolden never received a pro contract. For the past two years, he 
has struggled to keep alive his dream of making it to the pro ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Patience finally seems to have paid off, however. Bolden, a 6-foot-5 off-guard, 
is flourishing as a member of the NBA Pro team that is competing in the 
Southern California Summer Pro League at Loyola Marymount. His teammates 
include Ralph Sampson of the Sacramento Kings and Leon Wood, most recently of 
the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Before the start of Thursday night's game against the NBA Stars, led by Byron 
Scott of the Lakers, Bolden tried not to rush through warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just so happy to be out here that I don't want it to end," said Bolden, a 
three-year starter who played at Northridge from 1984 to '88. "I'm finally 
getting my big break, and I want to make the most of it. This is what I've been 
waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
Bolden, a former All-Southern Section guard at L.A. Lutheran High in Burbank, 
is averaging 14 points a game as a reserve for the NBA Pros. His play has been 
so impressive that Coach Joe Weakley, an assistant at Crenshaw High, is certain 
that some team will invite Bolden to try out. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat is good enough to go on to the next level," Weakley said. "I don't know 
why he didn't get noticed before. He can do some very good things on the court. 
Perhaps he just wasn't getting enough exposure at Northridge. It's not a school 
known for its development of basketball players." 
</P>
<P>
Improving his skills enough to impress pro scouts has been a difficult task. 
After averaging 16.4 points during his senior season, Bolden was neither 
drafted nor contacted by any teams, and he did not have an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Bolden tried out for the Summer Pro League at Loyola in 1988 and was selected 
to play on a free-agent team. Although he performed well, there were no serious 
offers at the end of the three-week league. He was invited to attend leagues in 
both Mexico and Ecuador, but plans fell through at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
For the next year, Bolden worked as a salesman for a video distribution company 
in Woodland Hills and took some classes at Northridge. He also played in a few 
recreation leagues to stay in shape and waited for another chance to play in 
the Summer Pro League. 
</P>
<P>
He played on a free-agent team again last summer, and this time he came out of 
it with an agent, Mike Arias, who helped him get a tryout with the Wichita 
Falls Texans of the Continental Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the first cut there and thought I had a good chance of making the 
team," Bolden said. "When they chose the final 10, I was listed as the 11th 
man. A lot of guys, including myself, couldn't believe I didn't make the team. 
It was very political. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was a very good experience for me. I really improved my game. The 
competition was great." 
</P>
<P>
When the tryout ended in November, Bolden went back to the drawing board. He 
moved in with his parents, Prentis and Beverly Bolden, in Inglewood and began 
preparing for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing basketball since I was 8, so it's in my blood and I want to 
keep going," Bolden said. "At the same time, there have been many frustrating 
moments. I have felt like giving up quite a few times. Everyone has been so 
supportive that I just keep going. I know I'm good enough to make it, but it's 
easy to get down on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Bolden, who at 200 pounds said he is in the best shape of his life, started to 
have a change of luck this spring. His mother initiated conversations with Fred 
Slaughter, an ex-UCLA player and well-known agent whose clients include Wood 
and John Williams of the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter agreed to watch Bolden in the Run-'N-Shoot League at Crenshaw and 
liked what he saw. By mid-June, Slaughter agreed to represent Bolden and 
secured a place for him on Weakley's team. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem Pat's had the past couple years is a lack of exposure," Slaughter 
said. "The scouts don't notice you when you're on a free-agent team. But when 
you're with the pros, you get noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed with how he's doing. He's got a great jump shot and plays 
hard defense. He has a pro body. I think I'll be able to get him tryouts with 
several NBA teams. It was simply a matter of getting him where he should be." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bolden acknowledged being a bit nervous in the beginning about playing 
with the likes of Scott, Sampson and Wood, he said he now feels comfortable on 
his new team and is holding his own. Wood agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started practicing for the Summer League, I had no idea who Pat Bolden 
was," said Wood, a 6-3 guard. "But he's certainly caught my attention. That boy 
can really play. He's a very good ballhandler." 
</P>
<P>
Bolden said that since he joined the NBA Pros, he is able to make decisions 
much more quickly on the court, allowing him to anticipate what's going to 
happen and get free for an open shot. 
</P>
<P>
If Bolden fails to get an invitation to an NBA camp, he appears likely to 
generate interest from foreign teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love the opportunity to play in Europe," he said. "Italy or France 
would be great. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to finally be getting my chance."

IGNORED BY BIG SCHOOLS, ROBISON PICKS EL CAMINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, Rick Robison was upset and somewhat depressed that he didn't get a 
scholarship offer to play college basketball. After all, he led the South Bay 
in scoring as a senior at Torrance High and he was twice named to The Times' 
South Bay All-Star team. The prolific three-point shooter also led Torrance to 
the playoffs two consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"No one recruited me," Robison said. "No one offered me anything." 
</P>
<P>
As a junior in the 1988-89 season, Robison (28.6 points a game) was second in 
South Bay scoring to former Inglewood standout Harold Miner, now at USC. That 
year he led the Tartars to a third-place finish in the Bay League and the CIF 
Southern Section 4-AA Division quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Robison averaged 34.5 points a game, the state's third best high 
school average. He ended his two-year varsity career with 180 three-point 
baskets, believed to be the third highest mark in the Southern Section behind 
Rolling Hills' Steve Clover (Pepperdine) and former Glendora High standout 
Tracy Murray, now at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive shooting however, wasn't enough. Robison, who graduated with a 3.0 
grade-point average and scored 850 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, was 
bypassed by everyone, even the smaller NCAA schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what happened," Robison said shaking his head. "I just 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton basketball Coach John Sneed, who followed Robison's prep 
career, offered an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"He has very good knowledge of the game and he thinks right," Sneed said. "What 
he needs is experience. He needs physical maturity. A year or two at a 
(community college) and you'll see a lot of improvement." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, community college basketball was Robison's only choice. He 
considered walking on at Arizona State, but realized it would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
So the lanky 18-year-old chose El Camino, much to the satisfaction of Warrior 
Coach Ron McClurkin. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing against El Camino, but I was hoping I would go somewhere else," 
Robison said. "I guess in a way it's good because at least I'll get to play. If 
I would have gone to a Division I school I wouldn't get playing time." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 175-pound guard will add strength to the Warriors' solid back 
court, which includes sophomores Mike Houck, an all-star from Redondo High, and 
Darius Dubose, a fierce defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised no one recruited him," said McClurkin, who led the 
Warriors to the semifinals of the state tournament last season. "After his 
junior year I wouldn't have thought we ever had a chance to get him. He's an 
awfully smart ballplayer and he's great at decision making and a great passer 
and ballhandler. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought he was just a shooter, but he can do it all. He's an 
all-around ballplayer and a real fine athlete. He can just flat out play. He'll 
be a big part of this team." 
</P>
<P>
Robison said the initial disappointment of not getting a scholarship is gone. A 
brief conversation with an assistant coach from UC Irvine and another from 
Fullerton was the closest he came to playing at a big school. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he was discouraged, but never bitter. Now most of his energy is 
spent working 52 hours a week at a Torrance warehouse and playing in a summer 
league with El Camino's team. He has virtually no time to dwell on the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about it anymore," Robison said. "Well, maybe I do sometimes but 
I really don't worry about it like I used to. I can't worry about what could 
have been. It's behind me now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say 'forget basketball, I'm not going to play anymore.' I 
love it and I want to play." 
</P>
<P>
The next step for the baby-faced teen-ager with a Ricky Nelson crew cut is 
proving himself in the community college ranks and possibly earning a spot on a 
Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever they ask me to do I can do," Robison said. "If they want me to score 
I can score. If they want me to play defense I can do that. If they want me to 
set a pick I can. But I get the feeling they want me to score." 
</P>
<P>
Sneed believes Robison made a wise choice. "He's definitely doing the right 
thing," he said. "At El Camino he's going to get the experience he needs." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Strong, who coached Robison as a junior at Torrance, said he is ecstatic 
over Robison's choice of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Strong was a long-time assistant basketball coach at Torrance prior to a 
four-year stint as the boys' head coach. He left to become an assistant at El 
Camino last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick is a gamer," Strong said. "He's a very competitive young man. The one 
thing that stands out for me was during his junior year when he was in an auto 
accident. He was in a truck that rolled over and his knee was still very sore, 
but he still played. He hobbled around out there and had 21 points, the lowest 
he scored during his junior year. That's an indication of the kind of player he 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Strong said Robison, who lives in Harbor City with his mother and sister, can 
do a lot more than score from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
"He can improve on his lateral quickness, but he has the ability to hit lots of 
different shots," Strong said. "He can hit the medium-range jumper and he can 
pump fake." 
</P>
<P>
McClurkin believes Robison's only drawback will be defense, but he said all 
freshmen have a difficult time adjusting to El Camino's tough man-to-man 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be the question with Ricky, but no one plays defense the way we do," 
McClurkin said. "Every freshman I got, that's their biggest problem. In high 
school those guys play zone and we play a straight man 90% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken and shy Robison isn't worried. He said he will have no problem 
defending even the toughest players in the South Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds cocky, but I'm not cocky I'm just confident of what I can do," he 
said. "I think I'm misunderstood by a lot of people. They think I'm a mean, 
arrogant guy. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts me that people think that. It's just that I'll do anything to win. I 
put a lot of pressure on myself so I act a certain way when I play. If you know 
me you know I'm a nice guy. I'm really laid-back off the court." 
</P>
<P>
But he'll remain fierce and intense on the court, especially since he's trying 
to earn the scholarship offer he never got out of Torrance High.

A DUTCH TREAT; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. BASEBALL TEAM WILL SWING ALONG WITH MITCH MILLER TO EUROPE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mitch Miller's teams apparently are trying to hit to all fields. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, Miller and a team that includes several 
Valley-area high school and college players are venturing to Europe to tutor 
and compete against would-be adopters of America's national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer Miller took a contingent to France to help prepare the French 
national team for the European championships. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a Miller-led team, sponsored in part by the West Coast Baseball School 
in Agoura, will leave on a 10-day trip to the Netherlands where it will compete 
against the Dutch junior national team that is preparing for the junior world 
championships later this month in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans will play six or seven games in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Haarlem 
and also conduct clinics for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to approach the games trying to win, but we're going over there to 
prepare the Dutch," said Miller, a junior high school teacher and scout for the 
Kansas City Royals who has coached several teams in the Valley. "They don't 
have the luxury of turning on a TV and getting a baseball game every night like 
we can here. Their only instructional aids are videos and tapes of games. 
</P>
<P>
"They like teams to come over and demonstrate how to play in person." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen players, drawn primarily from the Valley and the West Side, were 
recruited by Miller and co-coach Bryan Maloney for the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Valley-area players making the trip include former Chatsworth High infielder 
Nick Simpson, pitcher John Levine of Oakwood, infielder Eric Berger of 
Crescenta Valley, catcher Mike Wisenberg and outfielder Kevin Egan of Glendale 
College, and catcher Mike Sims of Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Sims, who started for Northridge last season as a freshman, had planned to 
relax this summer after helping lead the Matadors to a second-place finish at 
the NCAA Division II World Series in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
But he jumped at the opportunity to travel overseas and is hoping to use the 
tour as preparation for Northridge's step up to Division I next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear it's a beautiful country," said Sims, who graduated from Alemany High. 
"I've been looking up things about it and I'm anxious to go out and see how 
they play baseball there." 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain: The Dutch team and facilities figure to be far better 
than those offered by the French, who did not compete in the 1984 or 1988 
Olympic baseball exhibitions but are shooting for the 1992 Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. team took seven of eight games against its inexperienced opponents 
during a two-week stay in and around Paris last August. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Vigo, a junior-to-be third baseman at Northridge, was among the 
contingent that visited France. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good experience just to see the way other people live," said Vigo, 
who is recovering from a torn hamstring suffered in the Division II national 
championship game at the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseballwise, I think the team that is going this year will see better 
competition than we experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the French, the Dutch are not novices when it comes to baseball. Several 
Americans play in professional leagues on teams sponsored by private 
corporations such as Philips Electronics, and at least one Dutchman has signed 
a contract with a major league organization in the U. S. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Americans practiced only informally a few times before departing, 
Vigo said unfamiliar teammates become close once they take the field in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about it is all the guys on the team got along," Vigo recalled 
of last year's squad. "We didn't know each other before we left, but being over 
there for two weeks, we became a team pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
Both on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to touring the cathedral of Notre Dame and the Louvre Museum as a 
group, the Americans displayed their unity by rallying together during a row 
with surly restaurant workers in a cafe along the Left Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he hopes to avoid a repeat of that kind of incident, but added that 
his players will have free time to explore the sights of the cities they visit. 
Among the attractions: the van Gogh and Rembrandt museums, Anne Frank's house, 
and the Heineken Brewery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an educational experience. For a lot of these kids it will be their first 
long trip away from home," said Miller, who has coached at Mission College and 
also was an assistant for the Valley Dodgers, who finished seventh at the 
National Baseball Congress World Series in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're also going over there to work on some skills and prepare these 
players for their seasons next year."

trainer Wayne Lukas said. "I wasn't worried when he went wide. I told Gary to 
stay in the middle of the track and stay out of trouble. I wanted him to be out 
in the clear. I didn't want anyone pushing him down on the rail. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a campaigner. He's very professional. Horse of the year is our major 
goal. Calumet has been on top before and we want to get them back on top. We'll 
look at the Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold Cup next." 
</P>
<P>
The Whitney victory was Criminal Type's fourth in a row and comes on the heels 
of wins over Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, both since retired, in Belmont's 
Metropolitan Handicap and the Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type was allowed to set the pace and posted moderate fractions of 24 
2/5 for the quarter, 48 2/5 for the half-mile and 1:12 2/5 for three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Midway in the turn, Stevens asked Criminal Type for speed and the horse 
responded, completing a mile in 1:36 2/5 and covering the final furlong in 12 
1/5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Spree, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr., finished well along the inside to 
claim second in the six-horse field, 2 1/2 lengths ahead of Mi Selecto. Tricky 
Creek, Exemplary Leader and Forever Silver completed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type returned $2.80, $2.20 and $2.10. Dancing Spree paid $2.80 and 
$2.10 and Mi Selecto was worth $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
In the Grade III A Phenomenon Stakes on the same card, Julio Garcia rode 
Prospectors Gamble to a 2 1/2-length victory over Sewickley in a six-furlong 
test for horses ages 3 and up. Prospectors Gamble, a 5-year-old son of Crafty 
Prospector, went the distance in 1:09 1-5 for his third victory in seven starts 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sewickley was 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Mr. Nickerson, with Quick Call the trailer 
in the four-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Prospectors Gamble earned $50,400 from a purse of $84,000 and returned $11 and 
$3.60. Sewickley paid $2.80. There was no show betting.

Beau Genius and Triteamtri ran virtually as a pair for most of the 1 1/4 miles 
before favored Beau Genius won the Arlington Challenge Cup by one length 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The glamour of the race was lost because of career-ending injuries to Sunday 
Silence, the 1989 Horse of the Year, and his Triple Crown rival, Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the inaugural Challenge Cup was to renew the rivalry between 
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, but both suffered injuries while preparing for 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
With Sunday Silence and Easy Goer out, Criminal Type, who beat both of them 
this year, was held out in favor of the Whitney, which he won Saturday at 
Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Genius was timed in 2:02 1/5 and paid $4.80, $3.80 and $2.80. Triteamtri 
paid $14.20 and $5.40 and Western Playboy returned $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Arlington, Southland-based Real Cash beat five other 3-year-olds in the 
American Derby. Real Cash, ridden by Pat Valenzuela, covered the 1 1/4 miles on 
a good track in 2:02 in beating Home At Last by one length. 
</P>
<P>
Real Cash, who took the lead from pace-setting Adjudicating entering the 
homestretch, returned $11.40, $5.60 and $3.20. Home At Last paid $4 and $2.60 
and Adjudicating returned $2.40.

Harmonious took the lead midway through the stretch and then held off Embassy 
Lobell by 1 1/2 lengths Saturday to win the $1,346,000 Hambletonian at the 
Meadowlands in straight heats. 
</P>
<P>
The Hambletonian victory was the third in four years for driver John Campbell 
and it also gave owner Frank Antonacci and his Lindy Racing Stable a record 
fourth victory. 
</P>
<P>
Harmonious and Embassy Lobell were both impressive in winning their divisions 
of the opening heat. Harmonious was by far the better horse in the second heat, 
trotting the mile 1:54 1/5, the third fastest heat in the 65-year history of 
the Hambletonian, the foremost trotting event.

OFFENSE SPUTTERS AGAINST CARDINALS

<P>
It was one of those days for Charger Coach Dan Henning that had to make him 
glad the regular season still is five weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers played the Phoenix Cardinals in a 60-play controlled scrimmage 
Saturday in front of 11,859 at Northern Arizona University's Walkup Skydome and 
left with as many questions raised as answered. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals outscored the Chargers, 17-10, but in these affairs, it is 
individual impressions that can matter more than points. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, the Chargers had a few subjects to ponder. Most of them 
centered on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joe Tolliver, in his first scrimmage of the season, looked more like the 
inexperienced second-year quarterback he is and less like the starting 
quarterback he will have to be to lead the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver was seven of 16 for 94 yards and threw two interceptions. The normally 
affable Tolliver was terse and highly self-critical in his post-scrimmage 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
He particularly was annoyed about the two interceptions. One was on a pass 
intended for H-back Tim Spencer near the sideline that was intercepted by free 
safety Lonnie Young. The other was a post route thrown to rookie wide receiver 
Nate Lewis that was intercepted by cornerback Marcus Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one I thought I had the guy wide open and the safety makes a great 
play," Tolliver said. "The second one I might have held onto a little too long. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some progress this week, but it all boils down to the scrimmage, and a 
poor showing like that ruins the whole trip." 
</P>
<P>
Henning was also displeased with the showing of Tolliver, who was in for the 
Chargers' first 24 plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy has got to know you can't hit the driver from the fairway all the time 
on your second shot on a par 5 when there are hazards around," Henning said. 
"There will be times when it is not his fault, but I believe both those 
interceptions were his fault. Not so much because they were bad passes, they 
were bad judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"One was thrown late, and one he tried to squeeze it there and instead he 
knocked it in the water. Penalty stroke." 
</P>
<P>
As for the other three quarterbacks, each had 12 plays to show their best. And 
for the second time this year, it was John Friesz, the sixth-round pick from 
Idaho, who made the most productive impression. 
</P>
<P>
Friesz, playing third, was five for eight for 56 yards and led the Chargers to 
their 10 points -- a 10-yard run by rookie free agent Jerry Mays and a 37-yard 
field goal by John Carney. The performance was almost a duplicate of what 
Friesz did 10 days earlier in a scrimmage against the Rams, when his two 
touchdown passes were the Chargers' only points. 
</P>
<P>
"He was smoother against these guys," Henning said. "He didn't have that stage 
fright he had against the Rams. He was much smoother this time." 
</P>
<P>
As for the other two quarterbacks, Mark Vlasic was four for seven for 40 yards, 
and David Archer was three of six for 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The running game also had a key breakdown. With Archer at quarterback in the 
final series, the Chargers took four tries at first-and-goal from the Cardinal 
3. Four handoffs to Marion Butts netted two yards. It was Butts' only action of 
the scrimmage, but Henning would not even bite at an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in cold right at the end, but I don't think that had anything to do 
with it," Henning said. "We ought to be able to send a guy in with a tuxedo 
from the three yard line four times and make a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Charger defense, the scrimmage provided few clues. Strong safety 
Martin Bayless was the only expected starter to play even a down as the other 
10 were either held out or are holding outs. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Cardinals a chance to raise the spirits of their own second-year 
quarterback, Timm Rosenbach. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach, who played in parts of two games as a rookie last season, completed 
eight of 10 passes for 143 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His touchdowns came on a four-yard pass to running back Vai Sikahema and a 
40-yard completion to rookie wide receiver Ricky Proehl. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense mainly used the scrimmage as a test of some of its younger 
players. One who got the longest look was cornerback Donald Frank, a rookie 
free agent from Winston-Salem State. Frank was on the field for all 60 Cardinal 
plays and finished with a team-high seven tackles. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw underneath him in zone but he needs to have some underneath help 
from the linebacker on his side," Henning said. "His man coverage was pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Another rookie cornerback, Keith Collins, had two interceptions of Cardinal 
quarterback Tom Tupa on the final series. 
</P>
<P>
"One was a little lucky; he got beat but the ball was laid out there and he 
kind of made up ground," Henning said. "The other was a pretty good play." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
There had been some debate earlier in the week about how the scrimmage would be 
played. The Chargers wanted full contact, except on the quarterback, and 60 
plays. The Cardinals wanted no tackling at all and 48 plays. The Chargers won 
that argument. . . . Running back Thomas Sanders, in his most action of 
training camp, gained 54 yards on eight carries and caught two passes for 28 
yards. . . . Running back Ronnie Harmon left the scrimmage with a dislocated 
finger. . . . Rookie wide receiver Walter Wilson led the Chargers with four 
receptions for 40 yards, but one of those he fumbled away while being tackled. 
. . . Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said Saturday afternoon he still 
was waiting to hear from the agent for cornerback Sam Seale about whether Seale 
would approve a two-year contract proposal. Beathard said the agent, Frank 
Bauer of Stockton, said Friday he would recommend to Seale that he approve the 
deal.

LEGAL SNAG POSES A NEW THREAT TO HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: STATE WARNS THE CITY AGAINST BUILDING MORE RESTAURANTS NEAR THE 
OCEAN, FURTHER IMPERILING THE CONTROVERSIAL PIERSIDE VILLAGE PROJECT.

<TEXT>
<P>
State regulators have warned city officials that they cannot legally build more 
restaurants on the ocean side of Pacific Coast Highway -- a stand that could 
threaten a key piece of the city's multimillion-dollar redevelopment effort. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful State Lands Commission has also hinted that it would go to court 
to halt construction of any restaurants in the controversial Pierside Village 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The state, based upon the advice of the office of the attorney general, 
continues to assert that the entire area is a dedicated public access and beach 
recreational area," said Dwight E. Sanders, chief of the State Lands 
Commission's division of research and planning. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders made the comment last month in a blistering letter to city officials in 
which he stated that the commission strongly disagreed with the city's 
environmental impact report on Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
The city's assessment, released in late July, concluded that the restaurant 
project would have no major impact on the ocean-bluff land at Main Street and 
Pacific Coast Highway. But the State Lands Commission contends that the city is 
legally bound to keep public easements near the municipal pier free of further 
commercial construction. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for Pierside Village call for at least three major restaurants, including 
a new building for the existing Maxwell's restaurant. The project also includes 
plazas, promenades, multilevel public parking and small takeout food services 
for beach-goers. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Pierside Village, including Councilman John Erskine, criticized 
the State Lands Commission this week for opposing the project, which they 
consider an important part of redevelopment at the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the documentation shows the project is an asset to the city and to the 
community," Erskine said. "I see no environmental impact that can't be 
mitigated." 
</P>
<P>
The city's environmental report on Pierside Village states that land use was 
among issues "not considered to be of significant concern" in the restaurant 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of Pierside say that land use is at the heart of their opposition 
and that the city should not build any more commercial structures on the ocean 
side of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with the project's critics, the commission said in its letter to the 
city that "the (environmental impact report's) indication that there is no 
potential impact is seriously flawed." 
</P>
<P>
But Erskine noted that much of the land-use criticism centers on charges of 
"visual pollution." He said the environmental report clearly shows that there 
would be little loss of ocean view if Pierside Village was built. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (report) goes into a lengthy review of the visual impact," Erskine 
said. "I think the visual impacts are very minimal, and the visual enhancement 
is very significant for those people who would be able to stand on the 
promenade and view the ocean and the surfing action." 
</P>
<P>
Geri Ortega, chairwoman of the city's Planning Commission and a critic of 
Pierside Village, also disputes the project's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with the State Lands Commission in their concern about this," Ortega 
said. "There is a larger question involved, and that is about the appropriate 
use of this public beach. The land is encumbered; it has an easement for public 
access." 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, the city of Huntington Beach sued several powerful owners of beach 
property near the municipal pier, including Standard Oil, the Southern Pacific 
Railway and the Huntington Beach Co. The city eventually won a court order that 
granted a public-access easement over the beach land. 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission contends that the city is the permanent custodian of 
that public easement and, therefore, cannot allow construction of any 
non-recreational buildings on oceanfront land. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, a spokeswoman for an environmental group called Save Our Parks, 
said she is dismayed that the city is trying to build on the public easement. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't, for the life of me, see why the city is still proceeding with this, 
staring in the face of opposition from the State Lands Commission and the 
attorney general's office," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook and her husband, John Fisher, led a move earlier this year to qualify a 
ballot measure for the city's Nov. 6 election. That measure, a proposed city 
charter amendment, would forbid the city from selling or leasing any beach or 
parkland unless specifically directed to by a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that if that proposal is approved by a majority of city voters, the 
Pierside Village project will grind to a halt.

CRIME: A FULLERTON WOMAN WITH A COCAINE HABIT IS ON THE RUN, ACCUSED OF 
PLOTTING TO MURDER A FAMILY MEMBER, A RESPECTED ANAHEIM BUSINESSWOMAN.

<P>
This is a tale of two sisters as different as night and day. 
</P>
<P>
One, a Fullerton woman with a dangerous penchant for cocaine, has been charged 
with being so greedy that she allegedly plotted the death of her own sister to 
avoid sharing an inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
The other is known as a respected Anaheim businesswoman who loved her sister so 
much, said a prosecutor, that she refused to believe she could be cold-hearted 
enough to want to have her killed. She even talked a judge into releasing her 
sister from jail into her custody. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the bizarre case, characterized by Deputy Dist. Atty. Aimee Libeu as 
"the stuff novels are made of" because of its allegations of greed and 
betrayal, emerged last week when a mistrial was declared. 
</P>
<P>
But many of those details are sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
The accused, Alice Marie Reidhead, has apparently fled. 
</P>
<P>
And the alleged target, her sister Karen Meadows, declines to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The case began to unfold the night of Oct. 25, 1988. Reidhead, then 34, was 
arrested at a Cypress motel after she allegedly paid an undercover police 
officer $800 to kill Meadows, then 35. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutor, Reidhead told a Cypress officer posing as a hit 
man that she wanted her sister out of the way so she could avoid sharing what 
she believed to be a $2-million property inheritance from her mother, Lorraine 
Hulbert. Reidhead also told the officer, according to court documents, that 
"she felt her sister had been back-stabbing her." 
</P>
<P>
Reidhead, who also goes by the alias of Alice Marie Witten, had agreed to pay 
$1,500, with the remaining $700 to be handed over after her sister was killed, 
police allege. 
</P>
<P>
"She stated she didn't want her sister to suffer," undercover Officer Roger 
Neumeister testified during Reidhead's preliminary hearing. "I told her I would 
make it look like an accident." 
</P>
<P>
The encounter at the motel was the second time Reidhead had met with the 
undercover officer to discuss the alleged murder plot. Neumeister wore a hidden 
microphone and their conversations were tape-recorded and monitored by Cypress 
Police Sgt. Gene Komrosky. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana defense attorney Michael Cassidy, who represents Reidhead, said he is 
confident he has a strong case to prove his client was a victim of police 
entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that there was no motive for Reidhead to solicit murder. Her mother 
was alive and healthy, and there was no expensive property to inherit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cassidy argues that the police tape-recordings aren't clear as to 
what his client really wanted from the undercover officer. In fact, during the 
preliminary hearing, the undercover officer admitted under cross-examination 
that Reidhead never actually used the words, "I want her killed . . . or I want 
her dead." 
</P>
<P>
What she did say, the officer testified, was that "she didn't want her 
(Meadows) around." Neumeister said that when he specifically asked if she 
wanted her sister killed, Reidhead responded, "That's a strong word." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cassidy, Reidhead contends that she paid the undercover officer 
$800 to purchase cocaine, not solicit the murder of her sister. She claims the 
officer even showed her the cocaine at the motel. The officer, however, 
testified during the preliminary hearing that it was Reidhead who brought the 
cocaine to the meeting and offered him some. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy said it was Elbert (Chick) Chickelero, an informant and drug suspect 
seeking leniency in his own case, who set up the initial meeting between 
Reidhead and the undercover officer. Chickelero told the officer, according to 
court documents, that Reidhead was looking for a hit man to kill her sister. 
Cassidy said police contacted Reidhead 24 times before they finally arrested 
her -- she never called them once. 
</P>
<P>
The night of Reidhead's arrest, Sgt. Komrosky said, he informed Meadows of her 
sister's alleged plot against her. Her reaction was one of total "shock," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the evidence that police said they had against her sister, Meadows 
refused to believe that Reidhead would do such a thing and was adamantly 
opposed to her being prosecuted. Libeu says that even though Meadows was the 
intended victim, under the law she really had no say in whether her sister was 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
But Meadows, who owns her own business, was so loyal to her younger sister that 
she persuaded Municipal Judge Alan N. McKone to release Reidhead from jail into 
her custody. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of an intended victim of a murder plot welcoming the accused 
conspirator into her home "is very unusual," said Deputy Public Defender Susan 
Green, who then represented Reidhead. "At that time, Karen felt Alice was not a 
threat to her. She wanted Alice to live with her. She was very concerned about 
her sister." 
</P>
<P>
According to Libeu, the sisters "had very different lifestyles" and Meadows had 
long taken a "parental" attitude toward Reidhead, "watching over her and 
feeling responsible for her." Meadows had long been concerned about her 
sister's drug problem. Reidhead was an admitted cocaine addict, according to 
her lawyer, Cassidy. Once, Meadows had nursed her through a drug rehabilitation 
program, Libeu said. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced of her sister's innocence, Meadows even appeared with her on the 
"Geraldo" television program in February. The show's topic was contract 
killing, and the sisters held hands throughout most of the broadcast. Meadows 
said she "laughed" at police when they told her of the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
Reidhead, who wore long dangling earrings and bore a hard look on her face 
during the show, denied the charge but admitted that she had been a cocaine 
addict, using as much as an ounce a week about the time of her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Meadows, dressed in a conservative gray suit, said she had always been close 
with her sister, and when host Geraldo Rivera asked Meadows what she would like 
to tell the prosecution about the charge against Reidhead, she answered, "I'm 
going to tell them they are full of crap." 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, however, Meadows' belief in her sister was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
In May, prosecutor Libeu said she finally showed Meadows the actual transcripts 
of her sister's conversations with the undercover officer. Meadows, she said, 
broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing vague about what (Reidhead) says" on the tapes, Sgt. Komrosky 
said. "You could hear the viciousness in her voice. You don't have to be a 
brain surgeon to figure out what she wanted done." 
</P>
<P>
It's "clear that she was soliciting the murder of her sister," Libeu said. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters split up, and as Reidhead's trial date approached, she became 
increasingly "depressed and fearful," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Reidhead pleaded no contest to a charge that she embezzled money from 
her employer, Western Waste, a Norwalk refuse hauling company, Libeu said. She 
was ordered to pay $4,400 in restitution for false claims she had processed in 
the company's insurance department. She was also sentenced to 180 days in jail, 
but that was stayed so she could make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reidhead had another misdemeanor case pending against her in Orange 
County, stemming from her arrest on a charge of being under the influence of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
On July 25, when a jury was selected for her trial on the charge of 
solicitation for murder, Reidhead attempted to plead no contest. She had come 
to court that day looking distressed and unkempt, Cassidy said. She wept a lot 
and was dressed in black spandex pants with spike, turquoise-colored high 
heels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan began to accept her plea, he asked 
Reidhead if it was true that she had tried to solicit the murder of her sister. 
"No," Reidhead screamed, and she began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
"She couldn't choke it out," Libeu said, "so the judge refused to accept the 
plea." 
</P>
<P>
That same day, the prosecutor filed a motion asking that Reidhead be taken into 
custody and her bail set at $100,000. Cassidy says that may have been the final 
straw. "She was very afraid of going to jail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, a Thursday, Reidhead didn't show up in court. When she failed to 
appear again on Monday, the judge issued a warrant for her arrest and declared 
a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
Meadows "has no idea where Alice is," Libeu said. "Meadows is concerned for her 
safety. She's under a lot of stress. She's refusing all interviews." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Komrosky is confident that police will eventually find Reidhead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't put anything past her," he said. "She was sophisticated enough to get 
away with embezzling money from her company for a long time, and she was 
sophisticated enough to contact persons in the world of murder-for-hire. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether she is going to try to get out of the country. But I 
think I will find her."

DIANNE KLEIN: THE DOOWHOP BEAT: WHO GAVE CENSORS THE LICENSE?

<P>
Yvonne de la Paix likes doo-wop music. So do I. It snaps, sizzles and curls 
your toes. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe computers can't appreciate that. They got no rhythm, got no soul, got 
no common sense to call their own. 
</P>
<P>
So I'll blame this one on the humans, those of the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles. They're the ones who sicked their computer on Yvonne de la Paix, and 
the computer, bless its little microchip heart, simply did as it was told. 
</P>
<P>
It ferreted Yvonne out. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Department recently received a letter of complaint from a member of the 
public on the Environmental License Plate DOOWHOP assigned to your Datsun," the 
certified letter sent to Yvonne's Westminster address began. 
</P>
<P>
"The configuration DOOWHOP is offensive to the Italian community." 
</P>
<P>
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
No, wait a minute. Make that, Oh yeah? 
</P>
<P>
GIMEABK! 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne, of course, is not being singled out. The DMV computer turned up more 
than 500 other such license plates -- all with some version of WOP or DAGO in 
them -- that are said to be offensive to the Italian community. 
</P>
<P>
The humans then reviewed those and winnowed the truly offensive down to 333. 
The plates' registered owners were ordered to turn them in by July 26, or else. 
</P>
<P>
So far, according to DMV spokesman Bill Gengler, 182 drivers have demanded an 
administrative hearing to duke this thing out. Most of the others -- only 13 
cases have been closed -- still haven't made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne, though, is incensed. On principle. 
</P>
<P>
Because she sold her car in February (to a Cal State Fullerton student who says 
he's planning to give the DOOWHOP plates back to Yvonne), she hasn't even been 
using the tags lately. But still. 
</P>
<P>
"I was angered by the letter, implying that I was a bigot and that if I didn't 
turn over my plates in 14 days I would be taken to court," Yvonne says. "My 
license plate is not in any way a racist comment, unless the DMV or the Sons of 
Italy didn't know what they were attacking." 
</P>
<P>
The Sons of Italy is a fraternal organization with about 44,000 members 
nationwide, 12,000 of them in California. The Californians sent a letter and 
petition with 300 signatures asking that license plates bearing any and all 
configurations of WOP or DAGO be banned in the state. 
</P>
<P>
They made the same request last year, only this time they got action. Fast. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs insurance executive Richard Armento, chairman of the 
organization's Social Justice Commission, says the difference came after his 
counterpart in Virginia persuaded that state to outlaw the same offending 
plates. Armento wrote to Gov. Deukmejian asking him for the same treatment 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent my letter to the good governor on May 4, and on May 30 I got a call 
from the DMV saying they were going to recall the plates," Armento says. 
</P>
<P>
(The DMV's Gengler, meantime, says the governor had absolutely nothing to do 
with it, that Deukmejian's office simply passed Armento's letter on. He says 
the person at the DMV who ruled against the Sons' request last year is now 
dead, so they'll never know why he didn't take action.) 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the result of the petition was California's first mass recall of 
personalized license plates. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is the final judge," says Gengler. "With 300 signatures, we 
couldn't not do something. . . . And WOP and DAGO are racial slurs." 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, is true. To some extent. Many Italian-Americans, mostly the 
older generation, are offended by these terms. But many others, mostly the 
young, are not. 
</P>
<P>
It's been overwhelmingly Italian-Americans who requested the DAGO and WOP 
plates in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we did this, I've gotten 150 calls from people with the plates," Armento 
says. "They want to hang me. They are Italians, every one of them. They just 
don't understand what the problem is." 
</P>
<P>
Nor, of course, does Yvonne de la Paix. 
</P>
<P>
"Will I, as a woman of French descent, be able to disallow anyone who has a 
plate that may spell or remotely resemble FROG the right to a colorful plate?" 
she asks. "Gee, I might even demand that any sound or spelling of TOAD be 
recalled too as an indirect, negative reference to my heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Armento, incidentally, thinks that Yvonne should rail against FROG, which the 
DMV says is acceptable for a state license plate, although it's currently not 
on any vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
As for DOOWHOP, Armento says that maybe that should be allowed to squeak by. He 
thinks the correctly spelled DOO WOP, however, should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you see," Armento says, "then they've got the WOP in there, and that 
offends me, and a whole lot of other people." 
</P>
<P>
So maybe some of you -- Italian-Americans, Polish-Americans, Mexican-Americans, 
Irish-Americans and every other kind of American -- are thinking, "Where do you 
draw the line?" 
</P>
<P>
When does freedom of expression go too far? Or can it ever? And who is to 
decide? By what right? 
</P>
<P>
The debate, these days, is popping up all the time and positions -- as I'm sure 
you've noticed -- are becoming extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Some, for example, would outlaw all to which they take offense. The work of 
rappers 2 Live Crew, painter Andres Serrano, comedian Andrew Dice Clay and 
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe come to mind. Throw into the mix the flag 
burners and screecher-songstress Roseanne Barr and you've got quite a group. 
</P>
<P>
They've been called racist, sexist, blasphemous, pornographic, treacherous and 
lacking in all standards of good taste. Depending upon who's doing the 
appraising, they may be all, or none, or some of the above. 
</P>
<P>
But even if they are offensive, it is worth repeating that they have the right 
to be -- as well they should. Even if I, or my neighbor, or my congressman, or 
anybody else, doesn't like it one bit. 
</P>
<P>
Today it's tolerance that's in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Yvonne de la Paix wants to know: "How far will our own paranoia and 
mistrust go? Has it gone so far that we automatically see racists in everyone 
who is not exactly like us? Doesn't that, then, make us bigots ourselves?" 
</P>
<P>
Good question, Yvonne. At the rate we're going, it may take King Solomon to 
figure this mess out.

AVIATION: SAILPLANES, A TWIST ON GLIDERS, ALLOW PEOPLE WHO AREN'T IN A HURRY -- 
OFTEN OLDER FOLKS -- TO INDULGE BOTH THEIR LOVE OF FLYING AND THIRST FOR 
ADVENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bumping around in a plane without an engine doesn't sound like the greatest 
cure for open-heart surgery, but for Hal Lord, flying one of the sleek planes 
was just the treatment he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Lord didn't start flying a sailplane, a type of glider, until he was 65, and he 
wasn't about to let quadruple bypass surgery ground him. Now at the ripe old 
age of 69, Lord insists that flying has kept him young and vows that he'll keep 
at it until "they put me under." 
</P>
<P>
"If you get to be 60 and sit on your butt all the time, you aren't going to be 
around for long," said Lord, a retired Navy pilot who proudly wears a pin that 
reads "Retirement is a full-time job." 
</P>
<P>
Lord isn't alone among people his age who enjoy venturing into the air strapped 
to nothing more than a sailplane's seat. In fact, about 70% of the 39 flying 
members of the Orange County Soaring Assn. are older than 30, and 10 or so are 
older than 60. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, Hank Faeth, OCSA's oldest member at 69 years and 10 months. 
He's been flying motorized airplanes for more than 50 years and sailplanes for 
about 14 years. Or Ralph Fuller, a 30-year sailplane pilot who started training 
other pilots with the Air Force's Auxiliary Civil Air Patrol in Hawaii in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"There tend to be more older people in the club," said Fuller, 69, who is now 
an OCSA flight instructor. "Younger people are always in a hurry to get 
someplace." 
</P>
<P>
The fast life is not what these pilots experience. Adventure, yes. Challenge, 
definitely. But they do not live for the quickest route between two points. 
Although they can fly upward of 140 m.p.h., the route they take is anything but 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-pound planes get airborne by being towed behind motorized planes. 
Once high enough in the air, the glider pilot unhooks the sailplane's tow line 
and soars about, searching for shifting air currents. The planes stay aloft by 
riding warm patches of air called thermals. Heat bubbles off the desert -- like 
bubbles in a pot of boiling water -- and lifts the plane, often to heights of 
20,000 or 30,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
One recent Saturday, with his high-performance sailplane quietly hovering at 
about 6,500 feet, Fuller exclaimed almost with disbelief, "Here's this thing 
with no engine and two people in it going up. That's the exhilarating part." 
</P>
<P>
When one warm-air lift dies down, the pilot must soar in search of another. 
Veteran fliers can see the currents of moving air -- all but invisible to the 
untrained eye -- and maneuver their planes toward them. Typical flights last 
about an hour, but seasoned sailplane pilots can find enough summer thermals to 
fly for hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Glider pilots are always working with Mother Nature," Fuller said. "In power 
planes, you go from A to B. There's no sport in that. This is pure sport. And 
on the right day, you can stay up all day." 
</P>
<P>
A "right day" is marked by typical Southern California summer weather, with 
high afternoon temperatures in contrast with cool temperatures from the night 
before. The drastic change in temperature creates a lot of relative heat and 
the strong thermals that give sailplanes their lift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shooting Straight Up 
</P>
<P>
Ideal conditions are found in the nearby desert areas, Fuller said, because the 
desert floor reflects heat and produces strong thermals. In addition to the 
thermals, a natural phenomenon called a shearline makes flying in certain parts 
of Southern California different from almost anywhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Near Perris Valley Airport in Riverside County, where OCSA members do most of 
their flying, a shearline forms as warm desert winds ride over the cool marine 
air that gets trapped between two mountain ranges, Fuller said. The warm winds 
hit the cool air and tend to shoot straight up, lifting the smart sailplane 
pilot to incredible heights for miles. 
</P>
<P>
The cool marine air carries smog with it, in contrast to the clear desert 
currents, making it easier for pilots to spot and utilize shearlines. 
</P>
<P>
"You've now discovered the only good thing smog is used for," Faeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Every flight is different, depending on the amount of turbulence and lift that 
the pilot finds. Some flights are quiet, have little lift and can last 30 
minutes. Others are rougher, feature lots of lift and can last for hours. This 
particular Saturday, Lord had just returned from a three-hour flight. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't difficult to understand why the pilots seek to stay up so long. Once 
the sailplanes are flying on their own, the only noise is the sound of air 
washing over the plexiglass-covered cockpit or through the 3-by-3-inch vents 
that provide air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than 50 Flights 
</P>
<P>
"I love the feeling of your stomach being taken away and the earth rotating 
around you," OCSA member Meggan Clark said. "When you close your eyes and lay 
back, it feels like the bottom is dropping out of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
At one month shy of her 13th birthday, Clark is OCSA's youngest member, proving 
that the young can be young at heart too. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down from my first flight and I'm like, 'Yeah, I like this a lot. Can I 
join the club too?' " Clark remembers. She was 11 when she took her first ride 
and has been flying for almost two years now. She has more than 50 flights to 
her credit and is ready to fly by herself, but Federal Aviation Administration 
laws that govern sailplaning say she must be 14 to solo. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the age, the spark in each of these fliers' eyes is the same -- a 
desire for adventure mixed with a love of flying. And none of them ever expect 
to be cured of it. 
</P>
<P>
For 30-year-old Oscar Alonso of Westminster, sailplaning was one of those 
things he wanted to try before he got too old. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after my first flight, I said, 'Hey, this is for me,' " Alonso said. 
He's been flying now for three years and edits OCSA's monthly newsletter. "To 
fly, you've got to have some time and some money," he said. "When you are 
younger, you want to get ahead. But I had all these things I wanted to do 
before I got old." 
</P>
<P>
OCSA formed in 1959. Since then, the club has grown to more than 120 members, 
most supporting the sport but not actively flying. One-day OCSA memberships, 
which include an introductory flight of about 30 minutes, cost $40. For those 
interested in learning how to fly the planes themselves, club dues, National 
Soaring Society of America dues, insurance and monthly flying fees can reach 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The club is the most economical way to learn to fly, members say, because the 
only per-flight expense is the tow charge -- usually about $16. To fly 
privately with a commercial pilot, the flier must pay for the tow, the glider 
rental and the instructor's time. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's safe," Alonso said. "There's nothing to fail -- no lubricant, no fuel 
to go out. The only thing that is unsafe about sailplaning is hitting another 
aircraft in the air. Everything is a risk in life -- this not excluded. But if 
you had to pick something safe, this is the safest." 
</P>
<P>
For some of the fliers, now that they've started sailplaning, things will never 
be the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole game of soaring is loitering in the up-going air and hauling . . . 
in the down-going air," said 59-year-old Scott MacIndoe, a power pilot and 
five-year sailplane pilot from Tustin. "I kept riding by glider ports saying, 
'I've got to try one of those.' I did, and I got hooked. Now the only purpose 
for a plane with an engine is to get a glider off the ground."

<P>
SUPERVISOR'S RACE: INCUMBENT WIEDER ENJOYS A WIDE FINANCIAL LEAD, BUT 
CHALLENGER CLAIMS THE EDGE IN GRASS-ROOTS SUPPORT.

<P>
Although her once-hefty campaign coffers now hold only $35,000, Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder maintains a sizable financial lead over her November 
reelection opponent, Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer. 
</P>
<P>
But Neugebauer, with only $3,014 on hand, according to the latest campaign 
disclosure reports, says she is not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have enough grass-roots support that I'm not going to worry about the 
amount of dollars that Harriett has," Neugebauer said last week. As for her own 
comparatively small campaign fund, she added: "I'll watch it carefully and hope 
that it grows." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, according to her campaign forms, spent most of the $319,000 that she 
raised since January, 1989, on besting Neugebauer and a field of three other 
candidates in the June 5 primary. She won 47.4% of the vote, compared to 
Neugebauer's second-best 19.9%, and was forced into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Hoffenblum, Wieder's campaign chairman, said last week that the incumbent 
will rely heavily on direct mail and the telephone solicitations of campaign 
workers to raise additional funds for the rest of the campaign. Wieder will 
probably spend money on some advertising, he said, although no decision has 
been made yet on whether to use radio or television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go into specifics," Hoffenblum said. "She's going to run a hard-fought 
campaign is all I can tell you." 
</P>
<P>
During the last campaign reporting period, which ran from May 20 to June 30 and 
covered the crucial final days of the June campaign, Wieder's single largest 
expenditure was $70,258 to a Woodland Hills graphics company for preparation 
and handling of direct mailings to Orange County constituents. Her 
second-largest expenditure was $24,915 paid to the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder paid another $4,240 to Telly Design, a graphic arts firm in Pasadena, 
for work on direct-mail brochures and $2,800 to a polling firm. Hoffenblum's 
campaign consulting firm received $10,000 for work leading up to the June 
election; campaign treasurer Betty Presley received $7,065; and Sue Hutchinson, 
coordinator of volunteers, received $5,766. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Neugebauer's largest campaign expense in the latest reporting 
period was $5,247 spent on a brochure inserted with the Pennysaver shopper. She 
also received $715 worth of free printing from the Impression Connection in 
Westminster. Neugebauer said her campaign chairman, Ed Merrill, is an unpaid 
volunteer.

HUNTINGTON COUNCIL TO SPELL OUT PARK USES

<TEXT>
<P>
As part of the city's plans to develop unused portions of Huntington Central 
Park, the City Council on Monday will define the specific uses for a complex of 
sports and recreation buildings planned for a 5-acre area. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Engle, the city's acting community services director, is proposing that the 
section of the park be used for a swimming pool complex, a gymnastics center 
and a recreation center that would include a multipurpose gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have already set aside the land and have discussed Engle's 
proposed uses for the area, but have yet to determine exactly what facilities 
should be built there. 
</P>
<P>
In previous discussions of that issue, the council has been divided. Their main 
disagreement has been whether the gymnastics facility should be designated 
specifically for a single private organization or focus on being a public 
facility. Council members have also discussed whether the gymnastics center 
should be integrated into the recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the swimming complex could accommodate all levels of swimming 
competition and lessons. 
</P>
<P>
The recreation center would include indoor facilities for basketball, 
volleyball and other sports, as well as board games and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
The gymnastics center would be a separate facility solely designated for 
gymnastics training and competition. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed developments would be part of a 21-acre section of the park west 
of Golden West Street that the council plans to build into a sports and 
recreation hub for northwest Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-acre area borders the southern edge of a 16-acre site at Talbert Avenue 
designated for a lighted complex of youth baseball, soccer and football fields.

NEW TERMINAL DOWN TO FINISHING TOUCHES; 
</P>
<P>

A FIRE SYSTEM FAILS ITS FIRST TEST.

With the scheduled opening of the new John Wayne Airport terminal roughly six 
weeks away, airlines this week will began installing waiting room chairs and 
their own gate check-in facilities as the prime contractor winds down 
construction activities. 
</P>
<P>
And although glitches marred a test Friday of the new $63-million passenger 
terminal's fire control system, both airport officials and the contractor, 
Taylor Woodrow California Construction Ltd., praised the progress of the last 
few weeks, which was aimed at a public open house Sept. 7 and 8 and commercial 
use by jetliners Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The fuselage-shaped terminal is bustling with workers putting final touches on 
the most visible part of the county's biggest-ever public works project, a 
$310-million expansion that includes new roads, freeway ramps, parking garages, 
aircraft aprons and taxiways. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going pretty well," assistant airport manager Jan Mittermeier 
said. "Taylor Woodrow is working far ahead of their late (worst-case estimate) 
completion date of Aug. 23." 
</P>
<P>
The computerized fire suppression system failed its first test Friday when it 
did not automatically trigger an equipment shutdown, Mittermeier said. The 
system is the last big item in Taylor Woodrow's contract, although some workers 
are still laying the last pieces of marble flooring and carpeting in the north 
wing. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's test is nothing to get excited about," Mittermeier cautioned about the 
fire failure. "My understanding is that these systems never test out completely 
right the first time." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Taylor Woodrow asked all subcontractors to submit final financial 
claims so it can bill the county within 90 days. A notice to subcontractors 
stated that Taylor Woodrow expects to achieve "substantial completion" of the 
terminal by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier said the firm is not likely to meet that goal because of the fire 
system glitches. But she said the goal was probably too ambitious anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The problem-plagued terminal project -- months late and millions of dollars 
more expensive than planned -- stirred controversy from its beginning, when 
Taylor Woodrow's low bid came in about $17 million over the county's original 
budget of $42.5 million. A cost-cutting effort began. A major redesign took 
place after the architect was fined $775,000 for late and inaccurate drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the project missed a grand opening scheduled April 1, and a new 
target of Sept. 16 was selected. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taylor Woodrow was fired from a separate, $25-million job building a 
garage and elevated roadway, with the county citing errors and behind-schedule 
work. The contractor sued once and then again, hoping to nullify the county's 
subsequent award of that work to the Irvine-based McCarthy Bros. construction 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
However, Airport Manager George A. Rebella has insisted that the overall, 
$310-million expansion is on budget, with the five-year timetable originally 
expected actually compressed into just three years, after environmental 
litigation stalled it early on. 
</P>
<P>
The airport's 27,900-square-foot old terminal opened in 1967; the new terminal 
is 338,000 square feet. Passenger capacity will jump from 4.75 million a year 
now to 8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Working at a feverish pace the last few weeks because of a threat by the Board 
of Supervisors to fire the contractor from the terminal contract, Taylor 
Woodrow has at times had more than 200 workers on the site, 151 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, airport officials said, inspectors from the county's Environmental 
Management Agency have been combing the building for flaws. They hope to 
prevent problems that have occurred at some other Taylor Woodrow projects. 
</P>
<P>
At a new airport terminal in Tampa, hot water flowed through urinals, 
thermostats were installed incorrectly and some heating and air-conditioning 
vents were left unconnected. Taylor Woodrow, that airport's contractor, is 
embroiled in litigation with the Tampa airport authority. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow Senior Vice President William Ostfeld said that Orange County's 
"terminal project is looking very good. This week we've been working very 
closely with our client, the county, to test and check out systems. This is the 
normal procedure you go through when a project gets close to completion." 
</P>
<P>
But serious issues remain. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Taylor Woodrow's revised contract states that the terminal was 
supposed to be completed by May 16. The firm has asked for extensions, both to 
avoid late fines and to become eligible for on-time bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
But the county hasn't budged, so fines totaling several million dollars -- 
actually, withheld payments -- may take the project into court after the 
terminal is in use. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, there are payment disputes totaling several million dollars 
between Taylor Woodrow and its subcontractors, mostly about costly change 
orders issued by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest claim so far -- $4.6 million in damages for delays allegedly caused 
by the county -- is from Taylor Woodrow itself and remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
The second-biggest claim -- $3.7 million for speeded up work -- is from 
Utah-based Stott Steel Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Steel procurement was a big problem for the airport in 1988, with Taylor 
Woodrow and the county pointing fingers at each other over delays in placing 
steel orders with a mill. A Texas subcontractor of Stott's tried to charge the 
county for steel work actually to be performed by another company; the Texas 
firm was barred from the job. 
</P>
<P>
Stott and Taylor Woodrow split a $200,000 bonus for making up for some of the 
lost time later, but Stott has filed documents with the county alleging that it 
has received nowhere near the amount that it is owed. 
</P>
<P>
The documents show that the county never actually examined Stott's books to see 
whether Stott's bills were justified but offered to settle the dispute anyway 
-- for less than $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Stott officials argued that the county did not account for delays it caused by 
redesigning the building in mid-project. "The bottom line is that no agreed-to 
pricing was accepted by any of the involved parties" when speeded production 
schedules were agreed upon, the company's claim states. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Taylor Woodrow's problem," Mittermeier said. "We're not responsible for 
what Taylor Woodrow did to its steel supplier." 
</P>
<P>
The county's written responses, meanwhile, contend that Taylor Woodrow and 
Stott are responsible for some delays and errors and that the Utah firm is in 
effect trying to get the county to underwrite a major expansion of Stott's 
facilities that are still in use after the county's steel order was filled. 
</P>
<P>
Stott officials have countered that the county is "negotiating in bad faith."

AMERICAN LEGION: WOODLAND HILLS TEAM WAKES UP IN SEVENTH TO WIN, 8-6, AFTER 
SPOTTING LAKEWOOD A 5-0 LEAD.

The headline in the local morning newspaper screamed, "The Best in America." 
Under the headline was a large photo of Woodland Hills West Coach Don Hornback 
and third baseman Del Marine, smiles all around. 
</P>
<P>
For most of West's first-round game Saturday in the American Legion state 
tournament, this could have qualified as the ultimate in editorial license. 
</P>
<P>
In a game that started at a yawn past 9 a. m., the defending World Series 
champions managed just one hit over the first six innings and kicked the ball 
around often enough to hand Lakewood a five-run lead. Marine struck out his 
first three times up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it was," West right-hander Pat Treend said. "We went to bed 
early last night. We didn't ransack any restaurants or throw ice out of any 
windows." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe Lakewood merely got hold of a better cup of coffee -- on its roster 
was a reserve named Juan Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"It was early in the morning," West catcher Bobby Kim said. "I was nervous, 
real nervous, and it seemed like my whole body was tired." 
</P>
<P>
Kim and crew's lumber finally snapped out of its slumber, however, scoring 
eight runs in the seventh to defeat Lakewood, 8-6, at Cleve Borman Field. West 
(32-6) will play Union City in the second round at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
West, which lost its opener here last year -- another morning start -- seemed 
about ready to nod off for good before getting things rolling against Lakewood 
left-hander David Reeser. 
</P>
<P>
Through six innings, West had one single, a third-inning grounder to center by 
outfielder Chris Castillo. Reeser, who will be a senior in the fall at Lakewood 
High, retired 18 of the first 22 batters he faced, which was enough to finally 
send West first baseman Jason Cohen into a Friday the 13th-style tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
"Jason went crazy in the dugout in the seventh," Castillo said. "I've never 
seen him like that. He was screaming his head off, going nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Kim led off the seventh with a line single to left. Reeser, who had fanned 
seven and walked three over the first six innings, then faded. He walked Sean 
Boldt and Gregg Sheren on eight pitches to load the bases for Castillo, who 
sent a liner into left to make it 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Paul Geller doubled to left-center, driving in Boldt and Sheren 
to cut the Lakewood lead to 5-3. Reeser then hit Jeff Marks in the back to 
reload the bases and was relieved by his younger brother, Dan, another 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Marine, who didn't have many good swings against Dave, didn't look too dapper 
against Dan, either. Marine topped one down the third-base line, where Richard 
Alvarez stepped on the bag for a forceout and gunned to first for what could 
have been an inning-ending double play. But the throw was in the dirt and 
skipped down the line into foul territory. Two runs scored and a slightly 
confused Marine wheeled all the way over to third. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see what happened," Marine said. "I stopped running. I thought it was 
a foul ball." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's single drove in Marine to give West a 6-5 lead and Kim -- whose single 
started the outburst -- then slammed a 400-plus-foot bomb over the scoreboard 
in left for an 8-5 lead. It was the sixth home run of the summer for the 
red-hot Kim, who is 15 for 28 with 14 runs batted over the past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Kim figured that West was tired early. Lakewood napped later on. 
</P>
<P>
"It started getting scary," Kim said. "Luckily, (David Reeser) started getting 
tired around the sixth." 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood (25-5) scored three runs in the second and two in the third to take a 
5-0 lead off Treend. West errors -- the defending World Series champion 
committed eight -- led to all five runs. 
</P>
<P>
Boldt dropped a fly ball in right to open the second and Lakewood banged out 
three consecutive two-out, run-scoring singles for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Geller booted a routine grounder at second with two out and 
Treend surrendered back-to-back, run-scoring doubles by Shawn Clodfelder and 
Alvarez as Lakewood took a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought Cohen was upset? 
</P>
<P>
"(Treend) was getting really . . . off," Kim said. "He was throwing his glove 
in the dugout. He kept yelling, 'Play some defense and get me some hits off 
this . . . 11th-grader.' " 
</P>
<P>
Treend (7-3) had a legitimate gripe. He did not allow an earned run, struck out 
10 and walked four. He allowed nine hits, but only three over the final six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"That was typical of us," Kim said. "We get our butts kicked for a while and 
then we come back later." 
</P>
<P>
And later, as in today's noon start, had better not come any sooner.

GARRIDO SAYS HE PROBABLY WOULD TAKE TITAN JOB; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THOUGH SEARCH CONTINUES, FORMER FULLERTON COACH SAYS HE IS CONVINCED 
OF SCHOOL'S COMMITMENT TO SPORT AFTER MEETING WITH OFFICIALS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having spent the past three days in Orange County discussing the Cal State 
Fullerton baseball coaching job with Titan officials, Augie Garrido is 
convinced he would like to return to the program he guided to national 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the selection committee would see me as the best candidate, I would 
probably accept the job," said Garrido, the Illinois coach who led Fullerton to 
College World Series championships in 1979 and '84. "I'm going to continue to 
pursue the job -- take it to the end of the process and see where it takes me." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido, who Saturday left for Edmonton, Canada, to rejoin Team U.S.A. for the 
World Cup Games, met with the five-person selection committee Friday for about 
an hour. He also has met with Titan Athletic Director Ed Carroll and associate 
athletic director Steve DiTolla, who oversees baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido said he has not been offered the job, but most of his concerns about 
the program -- primarily the school's commitment to the sport -- apparently 
have been addressed to his approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the direction they're going," Garrido said. "I feel good about 
the cooperative effort that will be made on behalf of the administration. 
They're actively going to participate in the program, and that's a key issue." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido spent 15 years at Fullerton, the first two at the Division II level, 
but after moving to Division I in 1975, he guided the Titans to a 611-242 
record, 11 NCAA regional appearances and four College World Series appearances. 
</P>
<P>
But when he left for a six-figure contract and a strong administrative 
commitment at Illinois in 1987, Garrido said he felt like he was "treading 
water" at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the Titan coach has been directly responsible for raising about 
40% of the baseball budget -- about $100,000 now -- and that became a burden 
for Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Garrido, the Fullerton athletic department would take over 
most of the fund-raising duties in the future, allowing him to coach baseball. 
"I had reached the point where I wasn't able to implement new ideas, and we 
were constantly struggling to solve the same old problems," Garrido, 51, said. 
"That's what I have focused on in these conversations. I wanted to know there's 
a real opportunity to do some things that need to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido, who has led Illinois to two Big Ten titles in three seasons, believes 
there is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be different," he said. "They're going to build the stadium 
(Titan Sports Complex), and the administration is going to be involved in the 
program (through fund raising)." Garrido said he didn't know what Fullerton's 
timetable was for hiring a coach, and Carroll would not comment on the process 
or any of the candidates. But Garrido said he was told the selection committee 
would be interviewing other applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm done with the interviewing process," Garrido said. "It's their shot to 
call now."

<P>
Terrence Miskell of Salinas shot a three-under-par 69 Friday to score a 
nine-stroke victory over runner-up Bob May of La Habra in the Pacific Coast 
Amateur at the Eugene Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Also nine strokes back was Bill Edwards of Moultrie, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Miskell, runner-up in the U.S. Public Links Championship in 
Portland in July, finished with a 72-hole total of 10-under-par 278. 
</P>
<P>
Miskell's runaway victory wasn't even close to a tournament record for margin 
of victory. In 1988 at Bear Creek Golf Club in Colorado, Billy Mayfair won the 
Pacific Coast Amateur by 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Miskell started Friday's final round with an eight-shot advantage and he didn't 
let up from his stinging pace in the final 18, hitting 15 greens and mixing 
five birdies with three bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I play aggressive," Miskell said. "I'm out to make birdie, even if it's the 
hardest hole in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The California native played all four rounds below par, and finished the 
tournament with three consecutive rounds of 69.

U.S. PROMINENCE IN WORLD AGRICULTURE MARKET EBBING; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: IN THE GLOBAL FOOD ARENA, EXPERTS SAY, THE COUNTRY HAS LOST ITS CORNER 
ON TECHNOLOGY AND KNOWLEDGE.

Technology has been a major reason for the United States' success in the world 
agriculture market, but this country risks losing its prominence, experts said 
recently at a conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The day has passed when American agriculture had a lock on the world 
marketplace for food," U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said. 
</P>
<P>
He joined international food experts, scholars and businessmen in Indianapolis 
recently to discuss global food trends during the 1990s at a conference 
sponsored by the conservative think tank Hudson Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The United States held 35% of the value of world trade in bulk agriculture 
commodities in 1988, Yeutter said, but in intermediate products such as flours 
and vegetable fats, the U.S. share dropped to 18%. Among consumer-oriented 
agriculture products, such as processed fruits, cut flowers and bakery 
products, American farmers have less than a 6% stake. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Eastern Europe has begun moving toward free market systems. 
That won't help American farmers, but it may be a windfall for food processors, 
one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Judy, a Soviet specialist at the Hudson Institute, said there will be a 
demand for companies involved in food processing and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Central Soya, based in Ft. Wayne, Ind. Since January, it has 
formed joint ventures with Hungary's state-owned agribusiness concern to 
produce livestock feed and with a Yugoslav company to produce soybean 
concentrates used in meat processing. 
</P>
<P>
Bioprocessing represents another opportunity. Genetically engineered 
microorganisms will be used to produce food, fuel, industrial feedstocks and 
commodity chemicals from corn, sugar cane and other crops, said John R. 
Campbell, president of Oklahoma State University. 
</P>
<P>
However, such products may meet with resistance, including consumer fears. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology has been one of the major reasons for the success in American 
agriculture," said John Urbanchek, senior vice president for economics in the 
Washington office of consulting firm Hill and Knowlton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the contribution of current technology is being rapidly 
exhausted and must be replaced if the United States is to retain its prominence 
as an agricultural producer and exporter, and to continue to supply American 
consumers with high-quality, safe and reasonably priced food," he said.

CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: TAKING THE MYSTERY OUT OF LISTING TERMS; 
</P>
<P>
HOME SALES: THERE ARE SEVERAL CHOICES FOR THE HOMEOWNER WHEN CONTRACTING WITH A 
REAL ESTATE AGENT TO SELL PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-based syndicated real estate 
columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are thinking of selling your home, it will pay to spend a few minutes 
considering the pros and cons of your listing choices. 
</P>
<P>
To a real estate agent, a property listing is inventory. It costs the agent 
nothing. But a fairly priced listing gives the agent control of an asset that, 
if the agent does his or her job well, should produce a handsome sales 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
A listing is a contract between the real estate owner and a realty agent 
whereby the seller agrees to pay the agent a fee for selling the property on 
acceptable terms. But there are several types of listings, with different legal 
consequences, for the seller and agent. 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Open listings. From a real estate agent's viewpoint, the worst type of 
listing is the open listing. It is a written or oral invitation by a property 
owner to one or more real estate agents to find a buyer on terms acceptable to 
the seller. The first agent to bring a purchase contract, which the seller 
accepts, earns the entire sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
But an open listing is really no listing. At first glance, the open listing 
might seem attractive to agents. However, if the owner finds a buyer without an 
agent's help, then the seller owes no sales commission. Or the property owner 
can withdraw the property from the market and owe no fee to an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this lack of control over the sale, most realty agents will work on 
open listings only if the potential commission is large and there is nothing 
else to do on a rainy day. Few agents will advertise or spend much time on open 
listings. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Exclusive listings. An exclusive listing means the owner has listed the 
property for sale with just one real estate agent. However, there are two types 
of exclusive listings: 
</P>
<P>
Exclusive right to sell. Regardless of who finds a buyer for the property, 
whether it is the seller, the listing agent or a selling agent, the listing 
agent will earn the sales commission. Of course, if two agents are involved in 
the sale, they split the sales fee. 
</P>
<P>
Most realty agents prefer this type of listing, because it gives the agent 
maximum control over the sale. For this reason, agents gladly invest their time 
and money in the sale of a property listed on an exclusive right to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Most real estate agents don't want property owners to know about an exclusive 
agency listing. It earns the exclusive agent a sales commission if the listing 
agent, or any other licensee, finds an acceptable buyer for the property. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the property owner finds a buyer without the help of a licensed 
real estate agent, then the listing agent does not earn a sales commission. In 
other words, this type of listing creates a race between the owner and the 
exclusive agent to find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Multiple listings. This is not really a type of listing. A multiple 
listing is either an exclusive right to sell, or an exclusive agency listing, 
which is submitted to the local multiple listing service (MLS) for distribution 
to all member real estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
The MLS is a cooperative organization, often run by the local Board of 
Realtors, for sharing listings to give them the widest possible market exposure 
to agents who may have buyers looking for the exclusively listed property. 
</P>
<P>
The MLS does not accept open listings from the general public. Computers are 
widely used by local MLS members to quickly distribute the listings to members 
who also usually receive weekly MLS books with photos of all current listings. 
The MLS is considered a major marketing tool by agents and their sellers. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Net listings. A dangerous variation of an exclusive listing is the net 
listing, where the property owner specifies the net amount desired for the 
property and any amount received above this minimum becomes the agent's 
commission. Net listings are illegal in some states, but are legal in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you sign a $100,000 net listing for your property. If 
your realty agent obtains a $120,000 offer, you will feel cheated and might 
refuse to accept unless the agent cuts his $20,000 commission. However, if the 
agent receives a $100,000 purchase offer, the agent will earn nothing and might 
be tempted to forget to deliver such a low offer to you. The best way to avoid 
these net listing pitfalls is to exclusively list your property for sale at its 
fair market value, based on recent sales prices of nearby comparable 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
By knowing your real estate listing alternatives, you can decide which type of 
listing is best for you. For most home sellers the exclusive right to sell 
listing is best, because it gives the realty agent maximum sales incentive. 
Such a listing should be submitted by the agent to the local multiple listing 
service for maximum market exposure.

REAL ESTATE Q&amp;A: HOW TO USE THE 'OVER-55' TAX BREAK WHEN MOVING TO LESS 
COSTLY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We own our house, which should sell for about $275,000. As it only 
cost us about $40,000 many years ago, we want to shelter as much of our 
$235,000 profit from tax as possible. Although our plans are indefinite, we 
might buy a retirement home in Arizona or Florida. Is there any way we can 
shelter more than $125,000 of our profit from taxes? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes. I'll presume you or your spouse are 55 or older, have owned and 
lived in the principal residence at least three of the five years before its 
sale and have never used the $125,000 home-sale tax exemption before. 
</P>
<P>
When you claim this tax break on IRS Form 2119, you can subtract the $125,000 
exemption from your $275,000 adjusted (net after selling expenses) sales price 
to arrive at a $150,000 "revised adjusted sales price." Then you can use the 
"roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034. 
</P>
<P>
This tax break, available to principal residence sellers of any age, says you 
can defer the tax on the remaining $110,000 of your sale profit if you buy a 
replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost ($150,000) within 24 
months before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Builders Often Negotiate on Extras 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife insists that we buy a brand-new home rather than a resale house. We 
have looked at about a dozen new houses so far and the salespeople absolutely 
refuse to negotiate on price. But I have heard the sales of new homes are very 
slow. How can we negotiate on the price of new homes? 
</P>
<P>
A: Home builders are extremely reluctant to cut the prices of their new homes. 
The reason is the lower sales prices will cut the appraised values of future 
home sales in that builder's development. 
</P>
<P>
However, builders will negotiate on what is to be included in the sales price. 
Rather than reduce the price, home builders will include extras such as 
landscaping, appliances and upgrades such as carpets, mirrors and decorating. 
It won't hurt to ask. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrower Can Set Up Biweekly Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Q: I work in a large office. One of my co-workers has a part-time job where she 
sets up biweekly mortgage plans for homeowners. She showed me how I can cut my 
30-year mortgage down to about 20 years and save thousands of dollars of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
The catch is her company will convert my mortgage into a biweekly loan and a 
national bank will automatically withdraw a loan payment from my checking 
account every two weeks. But it will cost me $475 to set up this program. Do 
you think it is worth it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why pay someone else to do something that you can do for yourself? There are 
many biweekly mortgage conversion programs being marketed by various 
organizations. It is true you can save thousands of dollars by paying off your 
30-year mortgage as if it were a 20-year mortgage. Better yet, if you can 
afford the increased payment you could pay off your mortgage in 15 years and 
save thousands of dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you have a $100,000 home loan for 30 years at 10% 
interest with a $877.58 monthly payment. If you want to pay off that loan in 20 
years, increase your monthly payment to $965.03. However, if you prefer to pay 
off the mortgage in 15 years, the monthly payment will be $1,074.61, or almost 
$200 per month more than you are now paying. The savings will be thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't need your co-worker's help to do this. Just ask your lender how 
much you need to increase your monthly payment to pay off your mortgage in the 
number of years you desire. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the biweekly mortgage plans is you make 13 monthly payments 
each year instead of 12, thus paying off the loan in just over 20 years. But 
why pay someone $475 to set up the plan and let a bank earn huge profits on 
your money while it is being accumulated for the 13th payment? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Kind' Exchange for Sale of Apartment 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in one apartment of a four-apartment building I want to sell. As I 
have a profit of over $100,000 and am not yet age 55 and eligible for that 
"over 55 rule" you often discuss, what is the best way to avoid profit tax, so 
I can buy a single-family house? 
</P>
<P>
A: For income tax purposes you will be making a sale of one building with two 
tax consequences. You can defer the profit from the sale of the apartment where 
you live (by buying a replacement residence of equal or greater cost within 24 
months before or after the sale), but the profit on the sale of the three 
rental apartments will be taxable. 
</P>
<P>
However, to avoid tax on your entire profit, you can move out of your 
apartment, rent it to tenants, and then make a "like kind" IRC 1031 
tax-deferred exchange for a rental house. Later, you can convert the rental 
house into your personal residence without paying profit tax since no sale 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the tax law does not specify how long you must rent your 
apartment before exchanging or how long the house must be rented before you can 
convert it into your residence. But most tax advisers suggest renting at least 
six to 12 months and through the end of the tax year. Your tax adviser can give 
you further information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Owner Keeps Lease-Option Benefits 
</P>
<P>
Q: The market for home sales in our town is soft now, and I have seen several 
houses offered for sale on lease-options. Upon inquiry, it appears the 
lease-option is a great way for a home buyer to try out a home by renting it 
and to build up a down payment in the form of a rent credit. But are there any 
income tax deductions for the renter before the purchase option is exercised? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. During the lease-option term, the property owner retains the income tax 
deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes, operating expenses and 
depreciation. However, the lease-option tenant is compensated for the lack of 
income tax deductions by receiving a rent credit for part or all of the rent 
paid. In addition, the non-refundable consideration for the option also is 
usually credited toward the buyer's down payment. Ask your tax adviser to 
explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fixed-Rate Mortgage Offers Fewer Risks 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are in the process of buying a new home and have talked to mortgage 
lenders about fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. The best fixed-rate 
mortgage we found is slightly below 11% interest. But the best adjustable-rate 
mortgage we can find starts at 8% for six months and then jumps to 2.5% above 
the 11th District Cost of Funds Index, which is currently 8.26%. 
</P>
<P>
If the index stays the same, in six months, we will be paying just about the 
same cost as the fixed-rate mortgage. I don't see any advantage in the 
adjustable-rate mortgage, or am I blind? 
</P>
<P>
A: You understand the picture very well. If you can qualify for a fixed-rate 
mortgage, take it. Adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers take the risk rates might 
go up. Of course, they might come down. But fixed-rate borrowers also have a 
risk that rates might decline substantially. If that happens, they can 
refinance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Advantage of Small Down Payment 
</P>
<P>
Q: When you recently answered a question about why home buyers should make a 
small down payment when buying a home, in addition to the income tax and 
leverage advantages, why didn't you mention the advantage of the homeowner 
having cash in the bank instead of having it tied up in home equity? 
</P>
<P>
A: Shame on me for forgetting that major benefit. Frankly, I think leverage is 
the major advantage of making a small down payment on a home. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you bought a $100,000 home five years ago with a $10,000 
down payment and a $90,000 mortgage. If that home appreciated just 3% in each 
of the last five years, today it would be worth $115,926. That $15,926 profit 
is more than 150% of the $10,000 investment or 30% each year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Title Insurance Limited in Boundary Disputes 
</P>
<P>
Q: My neighbor claims my garage encroaches on her property five inches and she 
wants me to move my garage. I contacted the title insurance company, and they 
refuse to help me because I did not have a survey made at the time I purchased 
my house about six years ago. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Consult a real estate attorney. The title insurance company is correct that 
title insurance does not insure boundary locations unless a survey was made and 
the survey is insured, often at an extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
However, in most states there is a relatively short statute of limitations for 
encroachments. If the garage encroaches and it has done so for many years, it 
may be too late for the neighbor to assert her claim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lease-Option May Help Tough-to-Sell Unit 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the last three months, my condo has been listed for sale. It is priced 
reasonably according to comparable condo sales prices. The agent seems to be 
doing a good job. She advertises the house several times a week and holds an 
open house every other weekend. But no offers so far. I've got to move out of 
town next month. Do you think I should rent the condo instead of selling it? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. If you will be moving away, managing a rental from a long distance is 
not easy. A better alternative would be a one-year lease with option to 
purchase. For example, try running a classified want ad such as "$3,000 MOVES 
YOU IN. Spacious condo (describe it). All your rent applies to down payment on 
purchase. Call for details (phone number)." 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared for your phone to ring. However, be sure to check out the 
tenant-buyer's references very carefully because you don't want any 
long-distance problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Save Equity by Selling Before Foreclosure 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our townhouse will go to foreclosure sale next month. My wife and I are 
getting a divorce and neither of us wants to make up the almost $3,500 of 
defaulted payments. But we have about $15,000 equity in the townhouse that we 
hate to lose. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: First, let's face the facts. You don't have $15,000 equity. You have a 
$15,000 equity minus the $3,500 it will take to cure the mortgage default. 
Another problem is you need to get the lender's cooperation to let a buyer take 
over the existing mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
After you have gotten the lender's cooperation for a loan assumption to a 
qualified buyer, run a newspaper classified ad such as "Foreclosure Loss. Pay 
just $10,000 to take over mortgage on a delightful townhouse. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
From the $10,000 the $3,500 arrearage must be paid before the buyer can obtain 
marketable title, so you and your ex-wife will only net about $6,500. But 
that's better than the nothing you will receive after the foreclosure sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use Big Earnest Deposit in Making Low Offer 
</P>
<P>
Q: The house next door to mine is for sale. I want to buy it as an investment 
and to control who lives near me. But the owner's asking price is outrageous. 
What is the best technique for getting an offer accepted even though it is far 
below the asking price? 
</P>
<P>
A: A big earnest money deposit can be very influential to get a seller to 
accept a low offer. When the seller sees your large deposit check on the 
kitchen table, he knows you are a serious buyer. But a small deposit check with 
a low offer probably would be a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Can Be Deferred on Sale of 2 Homes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently married a woman who owns a condo that she plans to sell. I own a 
small house where we now live, but I want to sell so we can buy a nicer home 
together. Although we will be selling two residences, is there any way we can 
defer tax on both sales? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 
1034 is available to you. If you buy a replacement principal residence within 
24 months before or after the sales, costing at least as much as the total 
adjusted (net) sales prices of your two former principal residences, then both 
of you qualify for tax deferral on your sale profits. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose your wife's condo sells for $100,000 and your house 
sells for $125,000. If you together buy a new principal residence costing at 
least $225,000 in this example, then you must defer tax on the sale of both 
former principal residences. Please consult your tax adviser for further 
details.

SPEAKING OUT: BARRIER-FREE DESIGN BENEFITS ALL, NOT JUST DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUNE ISAACSON KAILES, Kailes is a disability policy consultant who consults 
with local, state, national and international organizations in the areas of 
disability-related advocacy, public policy, independent living center 
management and universal design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disability is a common occurence and characteristic of the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
Most people have at least one family member with a disability. 
</P>
<P>
There is a good chance (80% for the average life span) that you will experience 
a significant temporary or permanent disability at some point. 
</P>
<P>
There is a 95% chance that you will experience a temporary mobility impairment 
during your life such as a broken leg, sprained ankle, twisted knee, painful 
back. 
</P>
<P>
And most people, if they live long enough, will age into disability. 
</P>
<P>
The only tragedy of disability occurs when our built environment severely 
limits access, and participation, productivity, independence and equality are 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
The need for barrier-free or universal design is increasing because of American 
demographics: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Today one person out of 10 over the age of 15 has difficulty climbing 
steps, walking more than 1,000 feet and lifting or carrying a bag of groceries. 
If people with temporary disabilities are counted, this number multiplies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Baby boomers" are moving into older adulthood and are beginning to 
experience an increased incidence of disability. 
</P>
<P>
 -- People with disabilities and people who are aging will constitute the 
majority of the population within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As America grays, the prevalence of visual, hearing and mobility 
disabilities greatly increases. 
</P>
<P>
Some architects, designers and developers view various "access" regulations as 
out of proportion to "the need." They say that these regulations mandate 
designing for the "worst situation." 
</P>
<P>
Universal design is, in fact, designing for the best situation because it 
better accommodates everyone by meeting the needs of a changing population. 
</P>
<P>
An accessible or universally designed environment is not just for those who use 
walkers, canes, crutches, wheelchairs or guide dogs. Barriers are a problem for 
anyone whose mobility or navigation of the environment is limited due to size, 
age, pregnancy, vision, hearing, broken bones, sprains, arthritis or painful 
joints. 
</P>
<P>
Often, universal design costs no more than making the appropriate design 
decisions. And it is an important consideration because, looking at the bottom 
line, it allows people to maximize their independence. 
</P>
<P>
All businesses want to increase their market. Incorporating universal design 
features will help do that. 
</P>
<P>
For example: Helen is a 42-year-old corporate executive married to a 
stockbroker. The couple have four children. They live within one mile of a 
large, fully-equipped shopping center that they don't use. The reason? The 
center is not accessible. Due to an injury received in a car accident, at age 
17, Helen is a wheelchair user. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of curb cuts, designated parking spaces for people with disabilities 
and steps into stores, force this family to travel eight miles to use a center 
that is barrier-free. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say you owned a store in this complex. If your average customer sale is 
$10 and if you average 100 customers a day, then you may be losing $100 a day 
in sales. (Based on a conservative estimate that 10% of your potential 
customers have mobility impairments.) 
</P>
<P>
This nation's lack of access contributes heavily to the massive cost to 
government and taxpayers. President Bush estimates the cost of discrimination 
against people with disabilities is $300 billion, that is about $1,200 per year 
per person in this country. Much of this discrimination is caused by what can 
be termed "architectural disablement." 
</P>
<P>
For people with disabilities, the need for institutional change as a precursor 
to freedom is especially clear. No laws forbid people in wheelchairs to ride 
public buses or to enter public buildings, for example, but the steps at their 
entrances serve as more effective barricades than laws. 
</P>
<P>
When universal design is ignored, taxes rise because people who could be and 
would be self-supporting have to be supported. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice, a retired schoolteacher, fell and broke her hip. This accident left 
her unable to negotiate the steps to her second-floor apartment. The building 
lacked an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
Since she had no family to turn to for support as she had outlived them all, 
she was forced into a nursing home. Once her financial resources were 
exhausted, taxes supported her 15-year stay (at an average cost of $14,000 per 
year) in that nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, older people or people with disabilities live limited lives or give 
up their homes and neighborhoods prematurely because the standard housing of 
the past can't meet their needs. This costs taxpayers a massive amount. 
</P>
<P>
Many who cannot find alternate affordable housing are forced unnecessarily into 
costly government financed nursing homes or other publicly supported 
institutions. Others are forced onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The minimal costs of providing appropriate housing options for people with 
disabilities is well worth the investment because of the significant savings 
generated by enabling people to live independently in the community, get jobs, 
buy goods and services, and pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Many buildings in the future will have to be retrofitted to accommodate every 
member of the population. Many of these costs can now be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
One study in Sweden found that installation of elevators as a renovation in 
apartment buildings was 40% less costly than the institutional care they would 
have prevented. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Congress passed the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 to 
influence the construction of new housing units. These amendments mandate that 
new multifamily buildings having four or more units, scheduled for occupancy 
after March, 1991, must incorporate accessible design features that include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Doorways and passageways wide enough for wheelchair users to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kitchens and bathrooms that are useable by wheelchair users. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lever hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental 
controls between 15 and 54 inches from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars. 
</P>
<P>
These features apply to all units on the ground floor as well as those 
reachable by elevator. 
</P>
<P>
This is only the first of many mandates for universal design. It forces 
developers to build units that address the needs of a broader market. It does 
not exclude anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone benefits because these design features provide greater convenience and 
safety for all. 
</P>
<P>
Wide doors and hallways not only permit safer passage, but also make moving 
furniture and other belongings easier. Adjustable counters and storage spaces 
are not only helpful to wheelchair users but also benefit people who prefer to 
sit while performing tasks. 
</P>
<P>
From a construction perspective, developers often complain that ramps take up 
valuable real estate, but this is not necessary if entrances are placed at 
grade level. Stairs are not required, ramps are and the point is that you don't 
need both. It is steps that are unnecessary, hazardous and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Another common builders' complaint is that bathrooms and kitchens that easily 
accommodate wheelchair users use too much square footage. The extra space makes 
a great place for storage and work islands that can easily be removed when more 
space is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Many existing buildings will have to undergo extensive and expensive 
retrofitting to accommodate our quickly changing population. Many of these 
costs can be prevented if attention is paid now to designs that will 
accommodate everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Access features integrated into the design of new and remodeled facilities in 
the early conceptual stages of planning increase costs less than one-half of 
1%. If delayed, these costs approach 5% to 30% of the building costs. 
</P>
<P>
The resistance to universal design is partially caused by perceptions of 
"ruining the aesthetics" and "imposed constraint" on the creative process. Some 
builders and designers equate access with ugly and with having to respond to a 
small but loud and fanatical group of people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary there are thousands of examples of structures that incorporate 
universal design which are beautiful, tasteful, grand, creative, dramatic and 
have won many awards. 
</P>
<P>
Think about universal design on a personal level. Will your home be adaptable 
for a lifetime of use? Incorporate universal design features into your list 
when you rent, buy or remodel. This will increase your chances of living 
independently as you age or acquire a disability. 
</P>
<P>
Is your home a place that you and your family will be able to get around in? 
Will you be a prisoner in one room of a six-room home, or a prisoner on the 
second floor? Will you be able to use your community's churches, temples, 
community centers, restaurants or other local businesses? 
</P>
<P>
Everyone wants the right to remain in their home, to move freely around the 
community, to be with friends, to participate in social and recreational 
activities, and to live independently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ELEMENTS OF GOOD BARRIER-FREE DESIGN 
</P>
<P>
Short walking distances. 
</P>
<P>
Ease of paths of travel those which are level and include curb cuts or curb 
ramps at intersections and crosswalks. 
</P>
<P>
Covered walkways and sky walks for geographic areas that experience frequent 
inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
Inclines, which if needed, have gradual slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Building entrances with Bide doorways, doors which are easy to open and level 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
Elevators that are conveniently placed. 
</P>
<P>
Parking spaces that are close to entry ways and easy to use. 
</P>
<P>
Elevator buttons that are reachable by short people, children and wheelchair 
users. 
</P>
<P>
Adequate lighting that makes for safer areas, helps people with impaired vision 
and assists people with impaired hearing to read lips and observe body 
gestures. 
</P>
<P>
Well planned acoustical environments help people with hearing loses and assists 
people with visual impairments to use audible cues for getting around. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical outlets placed at easily reached heights. 
</P>
<P>
Handles at doors and drawers that require no gripping or twisting to operate, 
such as levers or loop handles. 
</P>
<P>
Alarm systems that are audible and visual. 
</P>
<P>
Restrooms and showers with wide stalls and adjustable height shower heads, stud 
reinforcements around tubs/showers and toilets which can easily accommodate 
grab bars if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Faucets easy to turn on and off. 
</P>
<P>
Non-skid surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Adjustable "built-in" counters and storage areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 On July 26, President Bush signed a new law that will bring 43 million 
disabled Americans into the economic mainstream by giving them equal access to 
jobs, transportation and public facilities. One challenge facing architects and 
developers is to design and construct more "barrier-free" homes and buildings.

TAX SAVINGS ON MORTGAGE EXAGGERATED 
</P>

QUESTION: My father-in-law is deceased now and my mother-in-law would like to 
pay off the mortgage on her home. But one of her sons insists on keeping a 
small mortgage on it for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
My father-in-law, every few years, would take out a mortgage so he could claim 
it on taxes. I cannot believe the benefits of this outweigh the interest rate, 
plus the bother of making these payments, etc. Even if you deposit this money 
from the mortgage at 5% or 6% it still is less than your mortgage payment 
interest. What's your opinion on this? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: This notion that you must have a mortgage is one that dies hard. The 
value of mortgage interest deductibility -- under the most ideal of 
circumstances -- is almost always grossly exaggerated. We're talking about X 
number of dollars in interest that will be deducted from your taxable income, 
and the resulting figure will then be taxed, probably, at about 28%. 
</P>
<P>
For every dollar that he's spending on interest he's saving 28 cents. Big deal! 
And, of course, he's also paying for the cost of borrowing it in the first 
place. As you say, what's the attraction of paying a lender 10% on money that 
you might then turn around and invest at 8%? 
</P>
<P>
And your mother-in-law is undoubtedly living on a fixed, reduced income and 
probably is being taxed (if at all) at the minimum rate, anyway. If she wants 
the peace of mind of having the home free of indebtedness, it's none of her 
son's business. 
</P>

Giving Property Back to S&amp;L Not Applauded 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently, you advised an elderly man from New Orleans to "tell the S&amp;L 
to take the property back." You seem to think it's the S&amp;L's fault that he 
has a negative cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
This irks me for a couple of reasons: The first is that elderly people have 
enough trouble receiving credit as it is, in fact we have laws to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, part of the reason that the S&amp;L industry is as big a mess as it 
is people with the "give it back" mentality. More palatable suggestions should 
have included renegotiating the rate or refinancing the loan. 
</P>
<P>
A: The elderly gentleman (he was in his 80s) wasn't experiencing a negative 
cash flow, or, more importantly, rapidly exhausting his liquid resources 
because of any fault of the S&amp;Ls involved. 
</P>
<P>
He was experiencing this because he was voluntarily -- and steeply -- 
accelerating the payoff of the mortgages on both pieces of income property 
simply to benefit his heirs. 
</P>
<P>
This 80-year-old man, at his age, simply could not afford to strap himself and 
deplete his irreplaceable resources by pandering to his heirs. 
</P>
<P>
If immediately stopping the principal-only acceleration didn't put his 
financial house in order then, I advised him, let the S&amp;L take one of the 
properties back. At his age he should worry about a black mark on his credit? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Frequent Payoffs Won't Make Difference 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read an article some time ago about making payments on a home weekly 
instead of monthly. If you made 52 weekly payments for the same total amount as 
12 monthly payments on a 10-year loan of $70,000 at 12%, what would be the 
savings on interest? What is the formula to figure this out? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, making the same annual payment on a weekly instead of a monthly basis 
(if you could find a lender obliging enough to go along with it -- which is 
doubtful) wouldn't have much of an impact. 
</P>
<P>
On this 10-year loan that you cite, by going weekly would save you only $460 in 
interest ($50,055 instead of $50,515). The formula is loan balance multiplied 
by the interest rate and divided by 12, or, in this case, divided by 52. 
</P>
<P>
Unless there is some acceleration involved -- another $5, $10, $20 or $50 per 
week or month -- frequency of payoff without acceleration doesn't make any 
dramatic waves. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
Why is there something less than comforting in knowing that, after paying 
$5,045 in monthly payments in your first year of a mortgage -- on $50,000 at 
9.5% -- you have built up a fat $308 in equity? That's about 6% of your 
payments. The other 94% went to the lender in interest. 
</P>
<P>
You can greatly step up this buildup of equity through painless acceleration of 
principal. "Free and Clear: Getting the Mortgage Monkey Off Your Back," 
explains how. Send a long, stamped, self-addressed envelope and $2 to cover 
costs to Don Campbell. P.O. Box 80260, Phoenix, Ariz. 85060.

DOWNTOWN: THEN, NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Lockwood's points regarding "L.A. Heart's Failure: . . ." (July 29) are 
well-taken. 
</P>
<P>
My first job, almost 50 years ago, was with the Bank of America at 7th and 
Olive Streets. 
</P>
<P>
The department stores were decidedly distinct, one from the other, rather than 
the present homogenization. 
</P>
<P>
Though times appeared safer than now, there also were more safeguards. Before 
Pershing Square was ruined by the underground parking construction, pedestrians 
could crisscross the park from corner to corner/side-to-side. One area, chained 
off, was designated "For Women Only." Police officers were at every 
intersection and officers walked the beat as well. 
</P>
<P>
During my last visit, earlier this year, around and west of the Biltmore, the 
lack of small, interesting shops was obvious. Cities become homogenized when 
the Golden Arches are allowed into every shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
I seldom go into downtown Los Angeles these years. Gone are the days when I 
took my children into Bullock's alley for a cappuccino. Or stopped for a quick 
nostalgic round-trip ride on Angel's Flight. 
</P>
<P>
And who wants to stroll around the outdoor mausoleum that is downtown around 
the west side of the Biltmore, when one can sit for hours watching in wonder 
the elegance of its parking entry? But as a young office worker, I did prowl 
during my lunch hours, shopping around 7th and Broadway, up 7th Street, with a 
bag of cookies from the dime store next to the Loew's State Theatre. And then 
there was Clifton's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It would be gratifying to know that as a result of articles such as Lockwood's, 
something might be done. I wish I could feel that someone developing a project 
downtown might make some change, alter some plan, rather than responses from 
letter writers as myself.

MONEY FOR CO-OPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the Speaking Out "Southland Hot Spot: Converting Co-Ops to Condos" 
(by F. Scott Jackson and Steven Solomon, July 22): 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of money available for stock co-ops if you know where to look 
for it. The National Cooperative Bank loans exclusively to co-ops. 
</P>
<P>
And the share loan market is heating up with several other lenders starting to 
compete for the business. 
</P>
<P>
Co-ops are increasingly a lifestyle choice as well as a legal and financial 
option. People are seeking a sense of community and co-ops will always be more 
effective in helping people achieve that. To say that "co-ops are on their way 
to extinction" does a real disservice to cooperatively oriented people among 
your readers. Co-ops will always be less expensive than condos for the 
first-time home buyer and others who choose co-ops for their long-term housing.

DENSE THINKING ON AREA'S GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "A Maturing L.A. Grows Up and In" (July 29), Greg Krikorian quotes Dan 
Garcia, former Los Angeles city planning commissioner: "Whether we like it or 
not . . . infill development provides opportunities to build the city without 
continuing our urban sprawl." 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of density-increasing, pro-development tripe that's 
contributing to destruction of the quality of life throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Density, not urban sprawl, is the major threat to many fine neighborhoods where 
crime, traffic congestion, overcrowded schools, parks and public facilities, 
and urban blight are driving people out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing inevitable about loading up our neighborhoods with massive 
condos and apartment buildings where California bungalows and duplexes once 
stood. All it takes to stop all the "make a quick buck development" is some 
politicians and neighborhood leaders with the backbone to say no to increased 
density. 
</P>
<P>
In my North Long Beach council district, we've been down zoning for eight 
years. We flatly reject the view that we have some vague responsibility to 
house the multitudes at the expense of existing neighborhoods. We don't have 
to, and we're not going to, no matter what the urban planners say. 
</P>
<P>
My position is that it's preferable to let the next few million new Southern 
Californians reside in Antelope Valley, Riverside or San Bernardino counties 
than it is to impact existing neighborhoods with a lot of overbuilding.

GARDENING Q&amp;A: ROSE PETALS FOR SALAD CAN BE HOME-GROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: In the produce section of my grocery, I saw an expensive package of 
flower petals -- including roses -- for use in salads. Can I use roses from my 
own garden in salads? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: If you don't apply pesticides, by all means use your rose petals in 
salads. A stunning opener to a meal is rose petal salad, consisting of endive, 
rose petals and toasted pine nuts served with a garnish of slivered limestone 
lettuce and dressed with raspberry vinaigrette.

Bird of Paradise's Place in the Sun 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the best location for a bird of paradise plant? Does it require an 
area where it will receive sun all-day long? 
</P>
<P>
A: A bird of paradise needs full sun in our beach areas; however, in the warmer 
inland valleys, it does best in partial or filtered sunlight.

Are Earthworms Good for Potted Plants? 
</P>
<P>
Q: If earthworms are good for the soil, are they also beneficial in my potted 
plants? 
</P>
<P>
A: Earthworms enrich the soil with their castings, and their burrowing assists 
in aerating and draining soil. But some people consider them a nuisance in 
lawns and in pots. If you have an excessive number, consider a commercial worm 
killer (available at some garden centers). In my own pots, I've noticed 
earthworms in the soil, but they don't seem to create any problem.

Using Less Fertilizer May Be Solution 
</P>
<P>
Q: Using rabbit droppings has increased leaf size and the size of plants but at 
the expense of flowers and crops. What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to an old copy of the Western Fertilizer Handbook, rabbit pellets 
or manure contains 2% nitrgen, 1.3% phosphorous and 1.2% potassium. If it were 
sold as a fertilizer it would say 2-1-1 on the label. That would make it a mild 
and balanced fertilizer but too much of anything is not a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of growth at the expense of flowers and fruit is simply too much 
fertilizer, nitrogen in particular. Simply use less, and give your extra to a 
neighbor who should be thrilled to get such a good fertilizer for free.

Excess Nitrogen Can Harm Epihyllums 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a small collection of epiphyllums and have always used Cactus Pete's 
fertilizer on them. Now that he has retired, what is an appropriate fertilizer? 
The Sunset Western Garden Book indicates "low nitrogen." Do they mean low or 
no? 
</P>
<P>
A: Excess nitrogen can can cause small round areas of rot that later callous 
and become hard, but the orchid cacti do need nitrogen, so the answer is "low.' 
Use any houseplant fertilizer where the second two numbers on the label are 
larger than the first, such as 5-10-10. 
</P>
<P>
That first number is the nitrogen content. Fertilizers formulated this way are 
usually sold as promoting flowering so that information on the label is the 
tip-off. Also, use the fertilizer half-stregth, since epiphyllums are not heavy 
feeders. -- R.S. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rotation May Help Boost Vegetable Yield 
</P>
<P>
Q: Perhaps you can help me with a puzzling problem. I have planted a vegetable 
garden each spring for the last five or six years, however now the yield is way 
down, even though the plants are lush and green. I add amendments and 
fertilizer each time I replant, so what am I doing wrong? We live in a canyon 
area where sun is scant -- a maximum of about five hours per day. 
</P>
<P>
A: The problem could be not enough sun. Perhaps the trees have grown taller 
during the last six years. Too little sun would certainly cause plants to grow 
lush, but fruit poorly. You also might try fertilizing less, since that also 
promotes leafy greens at the expense of fruit, unless you are growing leafy 
greens of course. 
</P>
<P>
You might also try crop rotation. Many plants shouldn't be grown in the same 
spot year after year. This is even true of flowers, such as delphiniums. 
Harmful soil organisms build up in the soil where the plants grow, but moving 
them leaves these organisms behind. Put the tomatoes where the lettuce was, the 
lettuce where you grew carrots before and so on. -- R.S.

Espalier Planting at Long, Blank Wall 
</P>
<P>
Q: We just moved into a newly constructed home that has a long, blank wall near 
the entry with only a foot of planting space. What can I grow in this space 
that will look attractive year round? 
</P>
<P>
A: Why not espalier a plant on a trellis or on plastic-coated wire in the 
European fashion? Some good shrubs for training are pyracantha, Parney 
cotoneaster, xylosma, photinia, Burford holly, Wilson holly, and twisted 
juniper. In European gardens, fruit trees like apple, pear and peach are the 
usual espalier subjects.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
 For a late show of color, plant petunias, marigolds, zinnias and lobelia. 
</P>
<P>
Water roses well during hot weather and mulch to help soil retain moisture. 
Fertilize now if you want blooms into and through the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Continue to mow the lawn at a high level. It helps keep the roots cool. 
</P>
<P>
Look for cannas to bring a colorful and tropical look to your back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Keep bougainvillea vines on the dry side during their bloom season to ensure 
the brightest bracts.

SCREENING WINDOWS AGAINST SUN'S HOT RAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have a problem with the hot sun shining in my windows. It's hot and 
it fades my furniture. What can I put on the windows in the summer that won't 
block the view or the winter sun for solar heating? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: In addition to increasing your air-conditioning bills and making you 
uncomfortable, the sun can do significant fading damage to your furniture and 
drapes. The bright sun also often creates enough glare to force you to close 
blinds and turn on a light. This wastes more electricity. 
</P>
<P>
There are several window sun-control options to satisfy your needs. Standard 
see-through tinted window film is the most effective method to block the sun's 
heat and fading rays. Unfortunately, it is on year-round and it blocks some of 
the passive solar heating rays in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
There is a new type of durable non-reflective vinyl sun-control window film 
that can be removed each winter and reused the following summer. Therefore, it 
won't block the beneficial winter sun's heat. It is very easy to apply and 
remove yourself each year. 
</P>
<P>
This lightly-tinted vinyl film holds itself in place on the window by its 
natural static electrical charge. This same type of clear film is used as 
labels on new TVs and other surfaces. It feels like it is glued to the glass, 
but it just peels off cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
You can apply this new reusable static-cling vinyl film either on the inside or 
outside surface of the window glass. To apply it, first clean the window 
surface. While it is damp, lay the piece of vinyl on it and smooth it out. It 
slides easily while it's still damp underneath. 
</P>
<P>
The tinted vinyl film blocks more than 50% of the sun's heat and glare and 95% 
of the ultraviolet fading rays. There is also an opaque (dark brown or ivory) 
type of static-cling film that is perforated. This blocks much of the sun's 
heat and fading rays, yet you can still see outdoors. It's like looking through 
a coarse window screen. 
</P>
<P>
Another option is the use of one of the indoor see-through tinted film 
pull-down window shades. These use a tough, heavy-gauge polyester window film. 
You can get either spring-loaded or rope-operated shades. 
</P>
<P>
These are available in many colors and varying degrees of reflectivity. They 
are very attractive and give you total control over the amount of light and 
heat you want to enter your room. The polyester material blocks 95% of the 
sun's fading rays and the various tints offer varying degrees of solar heat 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 286 listing the suppliers of 
the new do-it-yourself static-cling window films and pull-down tinted film 
shades, performance specifications, and a small sample piece of each to try on 
your windows. Please include $1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope.

How to Get Perfect Bead for Caulking 
</P>
<P>
Q: All my windows and doors in my house need to be re-caulked, but it costs a 
lot to have it done. When I caulked my previous house, I had a problem keeping 
an even bead. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: A good-looking and effective caulking job is an art and requires practice. 
Select an easy-to-use caulk material, like siliconized acrylic latex, which 
cleans up with water. True silicon is excellent caulk, but more difficult to 
work with. Another option is getting a cordless electronically-controlled 
caulking gun at a builders' supply outlet. You should be able to lay a perfect 
bead of caulk with one on your first try.

GETTING DRY PAINT OUT OF CARPETING DIFFICULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: During my last paint job, I covered the floor of the room I was 
painting thoroughly, but when I finished I found I had tracked latex paint 
throughout the rest of the house. How can I remove the stains on the carpet and 
varnished wood floors? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: To avoid tracking paint into unprotected areas, many pros wear galoshes 
that they step out of when leaving the work area. Getting dried paint out of 
carpeting is difficult. You might try scraping the carpet fibers with a razor. 
If you have a high-pile carpet, you might be able to get away with carefully 
cutting out some of the stained fiber. 
</P>
<P>
Do not use solvent on the varnished wood floor. Try washing the paint spots 
gently with a steel-wool soap pad. If that doesn't work, try scraping off the 
paint with a razor blade. 
</P>
<P>

Compound Available to Fix Wall Depression 
</P>
<P>
Q: There's a large depression in my basement wall, and chunks of gravel are 
exposed. What's the best way to repair the depression? 
</P>
<P>
A: The condition you describe is called "honeycombing" and can be patched with 
vinyl polymer patching compound. If the cavity is deep, it may be best to fill 
it in two stages -- first with a thin coat and then with a finish coat -- to 
prevent the patching material from sagging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Televisions Damaged in Lightning Storm 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've had two television sets damaged by lightning. It blows the tuner out 
even when the set is turned off. A 15-amp voltage surge protector installed 
between the wall plug and the TV plug hasn't helped. We have cable TV that is 
grounded outside. What can I do to prevent this from happening again? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your problem sounds like the classical example of what happens when the 
cable TV coaxial cable is not grounded properly. The National Electrical Code 
specifies that the CATV cable should not have a separate ground, but that it 
should share a common ground with the inlet electrical service to the house. 
</P>
<P>
If the electrical system and cable TV are grounded separately, a lightning 
surge can generate a difference of many thousands of volts between the power 
cord and the coaxial cable, causing the TV set to blow out. You can avoid this 
problem in the future by making sure the ground for the TV cable is connected 
and properly bonded to the main ground for the electrical service to your home.

RIGHT PANELING TRIM HELPS IN A TOUGH JAMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walls get ugly in a variety of ways. Over time, they may begin to crack. The 
paint may peel. Someone may cover them with hideous wallpaper, or coat them 
with a thick layer of paint to create a textured effect. 
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to deal with problems like these. You can try to remove or 
repair them. Or you can simply cover them up with a new wall. In many cases, 
the cover-up is the easiest route to take, especially if you do the job with 
prefinished paneling. You could also use drywall, but if you do, you'll have to 
tape all your joints, apply two or three coats of drywall compound, sand and 
then apply a couple of coats of paint. That adds up to a lot of work. If you 
choose paneling it's pretty much a matter of putting it up and getting on with 
your life. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's not quite that simple. Before you can panel, you'll have to 
remove all the trim -- moldings, casings, etc. -- on the old wall. After the 
paneling is up, you replace the trim, either reusing the old trim, or starting 
over with new. 
</P>
<P>
Your problems, if any, will no doubt center around the trim, especially at 
window and door openings. (Take a look at the sketch to see what I mean.) 
</P>
<P>
When your walls were originally built, the drywall or plaster was installed 
flush with the edges of door and window jambs. Then a piece of trim called 
casing was installed over the joint between the wall and the jamb, covering it 
up and creating a neat finished look. The right side of the top and bottom 
sketches shows this original condition. 
</P>
<P>
But when you apply paneling over an existing wall, you increase the thickness 
of the wall, and its surface no longer sets flush with the edge of the door and 
window jambs. (The left side of the lower sketch shows this situation quite 
clearly.) 
</P>
<P>
Solution? The sketch shows two possible ways to go. One is to rip a strip of 
pine to the thickness of the paneling and use it as a filler strip to bring the 
jambs out flush with the surface of the new paneling (see the left side of the 
top sketch). 
</P>
<P>
This works quite nicely if your jambs are painted. Just fasten the filler 
strips in place with brads and glue, fill any nail holes and paint both jam and 
filler strip. The strip will look like part of the original jamb and you are 
ready to reinstall your casing. 
</P>
<P>
This approach doesn't work quite so neatly if the jambs are finished naturally 
. . . with varnish and possibly a stain. The reason? It's difficult to match 
the color of the filler strip to the jamb. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, you might consider a different approach, shown in the lower 
sketch. Instead of putting a filler strip on the jamb, rabbet the back of the 
casing, cutting it so it wraps around the edge of the new paneling. This is 
more work, and it will require a table saw or a jointer, but it will provide an 
invisible solution to your problem.

ASK THE INSPECTOR: NON-SAFETY GLASS SLIDER COULD CAUSE INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL ROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our early-1960s house has a cracked sliding-glass door. We called a 
glass company, and were told that the sliders are dangerous and should all be 
replaced. Could this be a scare tactic to sell us new doors? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A cracked sliding glass door is proof that the glass isn't tempered 
safety glass, and it is indeed dangerous if someone should walk or stumble into 
it. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an alternative to complete replacement of all your doors. Safety 
film is available that laminates onto the glass, offering greatly enhanced 
protection. Of course, the cracked panel should be replaced with safety glass, 
but others can simply be coated with the safety film. 
</P>
<P>
We urge readers to check their sliding-glass doors (and picture windows) for an 
etched label similar to the labels on your car windows, which indicate safety 
glass. If they are not, have them coated or replaced. If replaced, you might 
consider updating to the fashionable "atrium doors" or French doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
View the Inspector as a Team Player 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm in the process of buying a home, and my agent said my home inspector 
exceeded his authority by suggesting safety features that were not required at 
the time of original construction. Was it proper of the inspector to question 
such things as lack of ground fault interrupters and earthquake strapping? 
</P>
<P>
A: It strikes me that you are now a better informed home buyer for knowing 
about enhancements that might make the house safer, regardless of whether they 
are mandatory. Think of the inspector as a personal consultant with information 
to share, and not (as your agent seems to think) as someone to simply recite 
what's broken or what's not working. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shower Volume Drops When Toilet Flushed 
</P>
<P>
Q: Over the last few years, we have noticed a drop in our shower pressure when 
a toilet in another bathroom is flushed. Is this a problem, and will it get 
worse? 
</P>
<P>
A: I presume you mean a drop in flow volume in the shower when other fixtures 
are used simultaneously. If your house is older, say 35 years or more, this 
condition is probably due to your water supply plumbing being aging galvanized 
iron pipe. 
</P>
<P>
This type of piping is notorious for becoming restricted and leak prone as it 
ages. Removal and replacement of all galvanized piping with a modern system is 
recommended. If your house is newer I would suspect an undersized main supply 
and/or branch piping. I recommend that a licensed plumber be contacted to 
determine if the water piping is properly sized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Association for Inspector Names 
</P>
<P>
Q: My real estate agent has advised me that she uses one inspection company all 
the time. Should I use the firm she recommends? 
</P>
<P>
A: Real estate professionals will usually suggest the names of at least three 
firms for you to choose from to avoid negligent-referral suits. I suggest you 
call the California Real Estate Inspectors Assn. at (800) 526-2135 for the 
names of member inspectors in your area. I also suggest that you shop for 
experience and quality, not price. A good inspection for the average home will 
cost $200 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tries to Find Source of Noxious Odor 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a noxious odor in our house. We're at our wits end with this problem 
and haven't been able to find what's causing it. We've explored the crawl space 
for dead animals or whatever; we've cleared away brush near the house where the 
former occupant's dog "went," but all to no avail. Do you have any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are a number of possible explanations. If it's an animal odor, you 
might try pulling back carpet to see if a pet's "accidents" might have 
penetrated the flooring. If the smell is musty, and especially if mildew occurs 
within the house, you should suspect water damage. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is a faulty sewer vent, allowing sewer gases to enter the 
house. Some home inspectors will do partial inspections such as this, but it 
may be on a "best effort" basis, since smells can be elusive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Do Costs Vary Widely for Inspections? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I called three home inspectors and got three widely different prices to 
inspect a house. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A: Home inspections are anything but standardized, thus neither are the fees. 
Think of us like you would a suit of clothes, which you might buy at a chain 
discount store or you might buy on Savile Row. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the analogy, some inspection companies offer simple "off the shelf" 
reports, others highly personalized "tailored" reports. We suggest you talk to 
each company thatyou are considering, and choose one whose qualifications and 
style meets your needs. 
</P>

Ross is the public relations chairman for the California Real Estate Inspection 
Assn. (CREIA), a statewide trade association of home inspectors. Readers may

COMMERCIAL SCENE: SECONDARY MORTGAGES POPULAR BUT RISKY; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENTS: WHILE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE MAIN PURCHASERS, INDIVIDUALS CAN 
PARTICIPATE IN REMICS AND CMOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Imagine owning your own home mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
As far-fetched as this prospect may seem, it's very much a reality thanks to 
two increasingly popular, yet controversial investment vehicles: real estate 
mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) and collateralized mortgage obligations 
(CMOs). 
</P>
<P>
These mortgage securities form the backbone of what's known in industry 
parlance as the secondary mortgage market. Lenders are often unwilling to wait 
the full term of a mortgage to get their money back. While they can't force 
borrowers to pay off their mortgages early, the lenders can sell off several 
hundred mortgages at a time to outside investors. 
</P>
<P>
These loans usually continue to be serviced by the original lender, but 
payments of principal and interest (less a moderate service fee) get passed on 
to REMIC and/or CMO investors. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, other banks and institutional investors are the buyers for 
these so-called mortgage pools. Individual investors can buy into the pools 
too, however. 
</P>
<P>
And theoretically, these investors can "buy" a part of their own mortgage -- 
along with a piece of several hundred other mortgages. CMOs and REMICs are 
usually bought in $1,000 denominations, although a minimum purchase of $25,000 
is usually advised. 
</P>
<P>
As long as investors are willing to put their money into CMOs and REMICs, 
lenders can continue to make mortgage loans -- often without soliciting bank 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
These real estate-linked securities also allow lenders to spread some of their 
interest rate and loan default risks among a broad pool of investors. 
</P>
<P>
Be advised: For individuals, assessing these risks is a difficult -- and some 
say impossible -- task. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most REMICs are also CMOs and most CMOs are REMICs. Basically, the 
investment sponsor elects to form a mortgage pool as a REMIC for tax purposes. 
The interest income from REMICs is taxable only for the individual investor. 
</P>
<P>
Pure CMOs (in non-REMIC form) are taxed as a corporation and the interest 
income is treated as a dividend for which investors must once again pay income 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, about 1,300 CMOs have been issued with an original value 
of about $380 billion, according to Salomon Bros Inc. 
</P>
<P>
These instruments can be issued by lenders directly, or more often through the 
Federal National Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. (Freddie Mac). 
</P>
<P>
The Government National Mortgage Assn. (Ginnie Mae) does not directly issue 
CMOs, but dealers do package CMOs based on Ginnie Mae collateral. 
</P>
<P>
Most CMOs are backed at least indirectly by the federal government, and such 
issues are generally rated as AAA bonds. These securities pay anywhere between 
30 and 100 basis points over Treasury securities -- currently yielding about 
8.5%. (That translates into an extra one-third to one full percentage point for 
investors -- or about 8.8% to 9.5%) 
</P>
<P>
This year, it should be noted, Fannie Mae alone has issued 98 CMOs. Freddie Mac 
has sponsored about 185 CMOs since its first such issue in June 1983, according 
to Lehman Bros. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
While CMOs and REMICs may seem relatively straightforward, nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
For CMOs aren't just sold to investors as a pool of whole mortgages. Rather, 
these loans are broken up into three to five other pools -- known as tranches. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who don't fully understand which tranch they are buying can be hurt 
by either getting their money back too soon or having to wait longer than they 
had expected to recover interest and principal. 
</P>
<P>
Each tranch also has its own interest rate yield. 
</P>
<P>
"CMOs are the real estate equivalent of a nuclear reactor," warned Burl East, a 
vice president at investment adviser Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in downtown 
Los Angeles. "They're the black hole of finance." 
</P>
<P>
"You need a supercomputer to figure these things out," East said. His advice to 
the individual investor: "You're probably in over your head." 
</P>
<P>
Individuals interested in mortgage securities are better off opting for less 
complicated and more direct investments in Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie 
Mac securities, East said. 
</P>
<P>
Understanding CMOs is no easy task even for the experts, said Fred Price, a 
principal at New York-based Sandler, O'Neill &amp; Partners, a brokerage firm 
specializing in mortgage securities for institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for us in the business to distinguish how certain tranches 
will pay out," Price said. "I don't think the (individual) investor has any 
place being in this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Not every broker agrees with East and Price, however. 
</P>
<P>
Some brokerage houses have been marketing CMOs as something of an investor 
panacea -- especially with uncertainty in the real estate and stock markets. 
Some CMOs are even paying as much as 14% annual interest. 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds to good to be true, consider that these CMOs are bundles of 
second vs. first mortgages, and that the risk of default is greater for these 
hybrid CMOs than for more traditional first trust deed mortgage pools. Also, 
these mortgage pools and their tranches are unaffiliated with Fannie Maes, 
Ginnie Maes or Freddie Macs. 
</P>
<P>
How does a tranch work? 
</P>
<P>
CMOs are usually structured to include three to five different bundles of cash 
flows -- or tranches. By breaking mortgage pools into these different tranches, 
investors have more of a choice in how they would like to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors may choose a tranch that accommodates a two-year investment. 
Others may opt for a longer-term tranch. CMOs are also often divided into 
Planned Amortization Classes (PACs) and Targeted Amortization Classes (TACs). 
</P>
<P>
PACs -- also known as Planned Redemption Obligations (PROs) -- first appeared 
in 1986 and function similarly to corporate sinking fund bonds. 
</P>
<P>
PAC bonds are retired according to a planned amortization schedule. The 
schedule of other tranches (such as a TAC, which is in essence a narrow PAC) 
are either accelerated or slowed to complement these PACs. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also have a choice of long-dated Z bonds that accrue interest and pay 
the investor nothing until all other tranches are paid out. These Z bonds are 
also known in some circles as accrual bonds. Investment advisers can't agree, 
though, on whether these Z bonds are in fact coupon bonds or not. 
</P>
<P>
They also can't agree on the wisdom of investing in what are known as IO and PO 
tranches. These interest-only and principal-only schedules provide yet another 
option for investors. Just about every broker/adviser urges that only the most 
sophisticated of securities mavens should indulge in these complex creations. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are CMO residuals for investors with a desire to gamble or a 
need to hedge a fixed-income portfolio against the risk or rising interest 
rates. Residuals are created when a CMO's actual cash flow exceeds the cash 
flow required to pay off bond holders. 
</P>
<P>
This may occur as a result of a small number of prepaid mortgages or because of 
very conservative predictions about the income from a mortgage pool. Investors 
can dabble in residuals through the direct issuance of a CMO, buying into a 
CMO-issuing entity or investing in a CMO owner's trust. 
</P>
<P>
Prepayment risk, it should be noted, is the biggest risk associated with CMOs. 
When interest rates go down, many homeowners refinance their mortgages at lower 
rates and pay off their old mortgages. When this happens, the CMO backer gets 
its money back earlier than expected, while the investor now is faced with 
reinvesting his/her/its money in lower-yielding instruments. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not yet confused, CMOs (REMIC or non-REMIC) may be for you. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to understand which maturity you're buying," said Stan Ross, 
partner at accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in Century City. Still, 
he added, "you can get some really excellent yields." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time to play with real estate yields," Ross concluded. But, "the 
minute someone says you can make lots of money," he warned, "beware!"

Great Western Builds New Headquarters 
</P>
<P>
Great Western Financial Corp. broke ground late last month on a new 
headquarters complex totaling 78,000 square feet on 20 acres in Chatsworth. The 
site is adjacent to nine buildings at Corbin Avenue and Plummer Street that 
currently serve as a company service center. 
</P>
<P>
A new 10-story executive office building is set for occupancy in 1992. Great 
Western's current headquarters -- a 10-story, 227,000-square-foot tower at 
Wilshire and La Cienega boulevards in Beverly Hills is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakes at West Covina -- a 16-acre office project set to eventually include 
614,000 square feet of office space -- officially opened its doors last 
Thursday with the completion of two four-story buildings totaling 180,000 
square feet. The $130-million business park is located near the San Bernardino 
Freeway at Vincent Avenue. Watt Investment Properties Inc. is the developer.

OFFICE VACANCIES LIMIT INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The high vacancy rates and overbuilding that plague most of the nation's office 
markets contributed to a "marginal" increase of 1.4% in net operating income 
last year over 1988, according to the Building Owners &amp; Managers Assn. 
International (BOMA). 
</P>
<P>
According to the just-published BOMA "1990 Experience Exchange Report," the 
nation's overall office building occupancy rate stands at 81.8%. Occupancy 
factors over the last decade range from a high of 93.7% in 1981 to a low of 
79.4% in 1987, according to BOMA. 
</P>
<P>
Expenses have increased "across the board," according to Roland O. Downing, 
president of the Washington-based professional association, while "defense 
spending cutbacks, down sizing in financial circles, and mergers and 
acquisitions are reducing the demand for office space at a time when supply is 
still increasing." 
</P>
<P>
Information about the book, which uses data from 4,335 office buildings in 108 
cities in the United States and Canada, is available from BOMA International, 
1201 New York Ave., N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20005.

WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: LIBERIA JOINS RANKS OF COUNTRIES TO BE AVOIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States, contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American embassy. 
</P>
<P>
AFRICA 
</P>
<P>
Liberia: Civil war continues unabated in this troubled country. In recent days, 
rebel forces have taken major portions of the capital city of Monrovia, while 
beleaguered President Samuel Doe has been in hiding in a seaside mansion. 
Loyalist forces are reported to have massacred hundreds of civilians in 
retaliation, and a loyalist counterattack in the downtown area and the embassy 
district of Mamba Point has driven back the rebels in heavy fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Doe is on the verge of defeat in the seven-month-old civil war, and it is 
uncertain how violent the aftermath will be. For civilians, the situation in 
Monrovia is grim -- they have been virtually without food, water or electricity 
for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
No travel should be undertaken to Liberia at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya: Long a bastion of stability in Africa, the country is experiencing 
upheaval. While most of the problems have occurred in the Nairobi area, the 
potential for trouble exists elsewhere. Consider Zimbabwe, Botswana or Tanzania 
as alternatives for game-viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Mali: Non-essential travel to the Gao (seventh) region, particularly east from 
Gao to the Niger border, should be postponed because of violence directed 
against security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Niger: Exercise caution when traveling to the Tchin-Tabaradene district north 
of Tahoua and west of the city of Tchin-Tabaradene due to armed dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Senegal: Exercise caution when traveling in areas bordering Mauritania and 
Guinea-Bissau, particularly in the area from Dagana to Bakel. There have been 
shooting incidents along the frontier. All air and land routes between Senegal 
and Mauritania have been closed due to soured diplomatic relations. It is no 
longer possible to get a Mauritanian visa in Senegal. Unstable conditions also 
exist in southern Senegal (Casamance). Contact the U.S. Embassy in Dakar if you 
plan on traveling to any of these areas. 
</P>
<P>
Zaire: Students demonstrating for a multiparty system have clashed recently 
with security forces in Kinshasa and other cities. Tensions are increasing. 
Avoid large gatherings. Register with the U.S. Embassy on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Zambia: Unrest has increased in Lusaka, with vigilantes patrolling the streets. 
Defer non-essential travel at this time. 
</P>
<P>
ASIA 
</P>
<P>
China: Hotel rooms and transport in and out of Beijing may be difficult to 
arrange while the city hosts the 11th Asian Games from mid-September to 
mid-October. Be sure to have confirmed reservations before arrival. 
</P>
<P>
India: Due to continuing unrest, travel to troubled Jammu and Kashmir state 
should be avoided. In addition, travelers should avoid flying on Indian 
Airlines' flights that originate in or are destined for Srinigar because of 
threats against these flights believed to be from militant groups. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise caution if visiting the suburban Calcutta areas of Purulia and 
Tiljalaa, which have been the sites of recent public violence. Several 
foreigners visiting the Ananda Marg organization facilities have been detained. 
Contact the American Consulate General in Calcutta for current information. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan: Ethnic violence in Karachi has become so entrenched that some fear 
the city could become another Beirut. Follow local newspapers for current 
conditions and be aware that the situation can change rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the unsettled political climate in Afghanistan, security in the Afghan 
refugee camps near Peshawar has deteriorated, with increased threats of 
violence against foreign aid workers. Police protection is also limited in the 
smuggler's bazaar in the Hayattabad district of Peshawar. Be especially 
cautious if contemplating a visit there. 
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka: Travel to the north and east is to be avoided because of ongoing 
civil strife, but the central and southern parts of the country, including 
western beaches and the hill tea country, are generally stable. Terrorist 
activity is unpredictable, however, so exercise caution, particularly in remote 
areas such as Yala National Park, which is open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
There have been outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever in some 
areas, including Colombo. Make sure immunizations are up to date, and try to 
avoid mosquitoes. Register with the U.S. Embassy on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE 
</P>
<P>
Poland: Visitors no longer need to exchange a specified amount of money daily. 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA and CARIBBEAN 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua: Recent strikes that paralyzed the country confirm that the 
Sandinistas, voted out of power earlier this year, retain substantial power as 
an opposition party. Such disruptions could occur at any time, and could affect 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad and Tobago: An attempted coup in this two-island nation has created 
chaos and disrupted travel. The six-day coup attempt, which began July 27, 
resulted in Muslim militants taking the prime minister and more than 
three-dozen other persons hostage in two separate buildings. The government 
maintained control of the airport, but no international flights were allowed to 
arrive or leave. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone contemplating travel to Trinidad and Tobago should wait until the 
situation stabilizes, but Caribbean tourism authorities have emphasized that 
the problem is a local one and should not affect travel to other countries in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA 
</P>
<P>
Brazil: Crime in Rio de Janeiro continues to climb, and statistics show that 
crime targeting foreigners is highest in the Copacabana and adjacent Leme 
neighborhoods. Avoid nightclubs and bars in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador: The northeastern jungle region should be avoided due to incursions of 
Colombian guerrillas, which have included the well-publicized kidnaping of an 
American in April. Travel to standard tourist destinations (Galapagos Islands, 
Quito, Cuenca, Otavalo and Ibarra; resorts in the eastern jungle, such as 
Flotel Orellana and La Selva; hotels in the Misahualli area, and the beach 
resorts of Salinas, Esmeraldas, Atacames and Manta) continues without problems. 
</P>
<P>
Peru: The recent inauguration of new President Alberto Fujimori has created 
optimism, but the country faces severe social and economic problems. Street 
crime remains high both in urban and rural areas.

Travelers visiting the historic Andean city of Cusco should exercise caution 
when touring the archeological sites outside the city and should not wander 
from the main roads. Purse-snatchers and pickpockets target tourists in Cusco. 
Due to increasing robberies in the vicinity of the train station, travelers 
should not walk there from their hotels in the early morning hours.

Micronesia: A cholera outbreak has been confirmed in the Chuuk/Truk State. 
Travelers to Chuuk/Truk State should avoid eating shellfish and raw fish and 
should avoid swimming or snorkeling in shallow waters near populated areas. 
Drink only bottled or otherwise purified water and wash hands regularly, 
especially before meals.

SOUTHEAST ASIA

<P>
Philippines: The mountain resort of Baguio, a popular tourist destination, was 
devastated by July's earthquake, and should be avoided until the city has 
recovered and roads are repaired. Manila is completely functional. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam: The Bush administration's policy change on Cambodia, marked by recent 
announcements that it would cease aiding the rebel coalition fighting the 
Vietnam-supported government and would enter talks with Vietnam about resolving 
the conflict, could lead to a normalization of relations between the United 
States and Vietnam. Such a move would undoubtedly lift travel restrictions, 
making it easier for Americans to visit Vietnam and making it possible for 
American companies to operate tours there.

PETE ROSE: HE WILL FIND THAT HUMILITY IS SECRET TO SURVIVAL IN PRISON, FORMER 
INMATE/ATHLETES SAY.

<P>
The spotlight and the special treatment that comes with it will be gone, 
replaced by a regimented lifestyle and a job that pays 11 cents an hour. The 
feeling of invincibility will be gone, too, replaced by emptiness and maybe 
even a little fear. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis courts and patio umbrellas aside, such will be life for federal prison 
inmate Pete Rose, according to several prominent former athletes who firsthand 
what the next few months hold for baseball's all-time leader in hits. 
</P>
<P>
Rose must report to the federal prison camp in Marion, Ill., by Aug. 10, to 
begin serving a five-month sentence for federal income tax violations. 
</P>
<P>
He will do his time at a minimum-security facility with tennis courts, 
umbrella-shaded patio furniture, a wildlife refuge and no fences. But even 
under those conditions, he will find prison to be a humbling, sometimes 
demeaning experience, say former athletes who have been there, particularly if 
he doesn't leave his customary swagger on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"How many hits did he have, 4,200-something? If he takes those 4,200 hits 
inside with him, somebody is going to put one of those hits in his eardrum," 
said former Detroit pitcher Denny McLain, who spent 29 1/2 months in maximum- 
and medium-security federal prisons after his conviction on charges of 
racketeering, extortion and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be with some white-collar guys -- embezzlers, tax-evaders. But 
he's also going to see some people who have committed crimes of violence, and 
he's not going to believe the mentality. I mean, there are some lunatics in 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Like in every prison in America, there will be small gangs. People will take 
sides. And you've got to be careful to stay out of the politics of the 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
One former professional athlete who served a prison sentence similar to Rose's 
is John Williams. An offensive tackle with the Rams and Baltimore Colts from 
1969 to 1979, Williams spent seven months in minimum-security federal prison 
camps in 1983 and '84 after his conviction in Minneapolis on a charge of aiding 
and abetting in the distribution of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
According to Williams, who did most of his time in the minimum-security 
facility in Leavenworth, Kan., his NFL background was widely known throughout 
the prison camp, but he was able to serve an uneventful sentence mainly by 
keeping as low a profile as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have to serve time, you have to accept it and be determined to go ahead 
and go through the process," said Williams, now a Minneapolis dentist. "The 
problems occur when people think they're exempt from the process or think they 
should have special treatment once they're in the system. You sort of have to 
go along with the program and say, 'Hey, I'm here. I've got to do whatever I've 
got to do.' 
</P>
<P>
"I got along with everyone well. I didn't have any problems. I'm not a flashy 
type of guy. . . . Then again, there was another athlete -- I don't want to 
mention the guy's name -- in the same facility who had a lot of problems, 
created a lot of dislike among the staff as well as the other inmates." 
</P>
<P>
But in the view of former Miami running back Mercury Morris, who served 3 1/2 
years of a 20-year sentence after being found guilty on drug-related charges in 
Miami in 1982, it is impossible for a truly famous former athlete to blend in 
with the prison population. 
</P>
<P>
"Because just as surely as you have people who want to do well by you, you have 
people who want to cross you, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris' prison term had barely begun when he found himself sparring verbally 
with a guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just been convicted -- minutes. Handcuffs and a suit," he said. "I got 
off on the fifth floor of the Dade County jail, and this guy goes, 'Oh, so 
you're Morris. Well, I'll tell you something. In about two months, they'll 
forget all about you. You'll just be another inmate around here.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'In about 20 minutes, I'm going to forget about you. Why don't you try 
doing the same.' That set the tone right there. I told the guy, 'Let me tell 
you something. I don't want any special favors, and I'm not going to accept any 
special abuse.' And that was the way I handled myself throughout the whole 
time." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Morris said that five charges of verbal disrespect were brought 
against him during his time in prison, some of it spent at Union Correctional 
Institute, a close-custody state facility in Raiford, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem I had was the female guards," he said. "It (a guard's 
order) would be something like, 'Hey, Morris, come over here. Why do you walk 
around like you do? Go bring me a shave.' A discretionary call. I'd go back to 
my room and wash my face. She'd say, 'That's OK.' It's just the control factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive Pete will have to deal with that type of individual, too, the 
kind who says, 'You're on my turf now.' They want to control you." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hayes, the former Olympic gold medalist and Dallas Cowboy wide receiver, 
got a similar reception upon arriving at a state prison facility in Texas to 
begin serving a five-year sentence after pleading guilty to drug-related 
charges in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first walked in, this guard walked straight through me," he said. "Just 
pushed me aside and kept walking. Big, stupid, ignorant guy. He said he hated 
the Cowboys, loved the Oilers. Then he threw a lot of stuff at me, like, 'One 
of your teammates was down here and said you were a racist, didn't like 
whites.' " 
</P>
<P>
After responding in kind -- "I pushed him back and let him know that I was 
there to do my time and not to take abuse from anybody," he said -- Hayes 
managed to serve out his sentence without further incident. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was concentrating on was getting out of there, just minding my own 
business and taking care of myself and no one else," said Hayes, who was 
paroled after nine months. 
</P>
<P>
McLain, whose conviction was overturned on appeal in 1987, said he never was 
taunted during his time in prison, but once, at the U.S. penitentiary in 
Atlanta, he was hit in the head by a fellow inmate wielding a fire 
extinguisher. The problem? The inmate felt that McLain was tying up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted the phone, and he tried to kill me with a 24-pound fire 
extinguisher," McLain said. "I mean, that's the kind of mentality that's in 
these places. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are behind a wall, you eventually will have a confrontation. 
Fortunately for Pete, he's not going to be in that long. If he leaves his 
arrogance at the front door, he shouldn't have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
For Rose, who has been undergoing treatment for the gambling addiction that led 
to his banishment from baseball a year ago, prison holds other dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"The last place in the world you want to send a guy who's got a gambling 
problem is jail," said McLain, now host of a radio talk show in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, I never in my life saw as much gambling as I did in jail. And while 
it's only $5 and $10 (being wagered), you've got to remember these guys make 
only $50 a month. So if you stiff a guy for $15 or $20, you may have a problem. 
When I first walked in, some guy said, 'I'm going to give you the best advice I 
can give you. Respect everybody in here, but don't trust anybody.' " 
</P>
<P>
Former Dallas linebacker Thomas Henderson, who spent 28 months in California 
state prisons after pleading no contest to charges of sexual battery and 
bribery in 1984 in Long Beach, recalled how inmates would bet packs of 
cigarettes on football games and said: "Those convicts will tell Pete Rose, 
'Hey, Pete, how much did you bet on the Reds?' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "The inmates are corrupt, getting away with things. Then you see 
some of the staff people doing things they shouldn't be doing. It's a wild 
scene. And the only thing you can do is just go through it. Who are you going 
to talk to about it?" 
</P>
<P>
According to McLain, who received five years' probation in 1988 after pleading 
guilty to several of the old charges against him as part of a plea-bargain 
agreement when the government sought to try him again, prison is "nothing more 
than a human holding tank" that offers inmates little chance for 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"You go in. You do your time. They hold you for that period of time. And they 
let you go," he said. "There's nothing inside prison that is rehabilitative. 
Nothing. Everything is poor." 
</P>
<P>
But Morris and Henderson, both of whom are active public speakers, have said 
that the time they spent in prison stripped away the bullet-proof feeling that 
comes from gaining fame as an athlete and helped them overcome their drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When people ask me, 'How did you get off cocaine and the like?' I say, 'Well, 
I had a determinative experience called a 20-year sentence,' " said Morris, who 
won his release in 1986 after he was granted a new trial by the Florida Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Said Henderson: "You know how some people refer to death as 'the other side?' 
Well, the joint was 'the other side' for me." 
</P>
<P>
What effect will a few months in a minimum-security federal prison have on Pete 
Rose, guilty of cheating on his taxes? 
</P>
<P>
Said Morris: "Well, look at it this way. There are people in prison for mass 
murder, and there are people in prison for catching lobster out of season. 
Everybody's got the same uniform on, but everybody's resolve is different. 
Everybody's rock bottom is different. Once you wise up to that aspect, it only 
matters that you learn from it."

RERUNS TO REWATCH: THE GOAT THAT ALMOST ATE MAYBERRY

Sleepy Mayberry wakes up for a while when an ornery billy goat swallows some 
dynamite in "The Loaded Goat" on The Andy Griffith Show (Friday at 3:35 p.m. on 
TBS). 
</P>
<P>
Usually the town's biggest danger is Barney Fife, but this time Jimmy the goat 
even has Barney beat. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy, who had insisted on coming to town to see the sights, gets loose and 
snacks on some explosives meant for highway work. ("First time he comes uptown 
he figures he's got to do everything," complains Jimmy's owner, Cy Hudgins). 
</P>
<P>
Barney and Andy put Jimmy in a sort of padded cell to keep him safe, but the 
goat's run-in with a drunken Otis- who doesn't like his new roommate- threatens 
to blow their plans sky-high. (Warns Andy: "About one loaded goat at a time is 
all we can handle.") 
</P>
<P>
In the end, thanks to Andy's brains and Barney's French harp playing, the goat 
winds up in one piece- and so does Mayberry.

VON SYDOW'S SCENES OF DESTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY MILLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This movie is not entertainment," Max Von Sydow says, casting his eye over the 
bloody costumes of dozens of Japanese people lying in a church courtyard. "It's 
much more of a political statement." 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who received a best actor Oscar nomination last year for "Pelle the 
Conqueror," is talking about NBC's "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes," about the 
aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing. It airs at 9 p.m. on Sunday, the 45th 
anniversary of the day the United States dropped the first atomic bomb, on 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The pacifist in me made me interested in this project," he says, explaining 
his decision to portray a German Catholic priest working in Hiroshima on Aug. 
6, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that we're sometimes reminded of important events in 
history. When Pope John Paul II visited Hiroshima recently, he says, 'We have 
to look to the past to learn for the future."' 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who first came to worldwide notice 35 years ago through the films of 
fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, explains he's not just talking about bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiroshima has become a metaphor not just for nuclear war but for war and 
destruction and violence toward civilians," he says. "It's not just the idea we 
should not use nuclear arms. We should not start another war because it's 
madness." 
</P>
<P>
The scene today in Valencia, which is standing in for Hiroshima, occurs the day 
after the bomb fell. With two wind machines at work blowing smoke and dust in 
the actors' faces, the scene is eerily reminiscent of photographs taken of the 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black cassock, Von Sydow busily attends the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb on Hiroshima, which flattened 90% of the city, resulted in nearly 
130,000 casualties. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later prompted 
the Japanese to accept unconditional surrender, bringing an end to World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other movies that have examined America's decision to bomb Japan, the 
focus of "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes" follows the survivors. In the ensemble 
film, Von Sydow shares billing with Judd Nelson (an American POW interned in a 
Hiroshima jail), Pat Morita (a Hiroshima postman), Tamlyn Tomito (a 
Japanese-American whose husband is in the Japanese Army) and Kim Miyori (a 
mother of a missing child). 
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow is reluctant to address the moral issues surrounding Hiroshima. "We 
don't know what would have happened if America hadn't dropped the bombs," he 
said. "It's easy to say that no bombs should have been dropped. But this was a 
war situation, and dropping them was an attempt to end the war." 
</P>
<P>
Although Von Sydow, 61, was too young to have fought in World War II, he did 
see its effects first-hand. In 1945 he was a high school student in Sweden, a 
country that remained neutral during the war. "That spring," he recalls, "the 
concentration camps were opened, and members of the Red Cross went in and 
brought a large number of prisoners to southern Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"I belonged to a folk dance group that visited these poor, miserable people and 
performed for them. We were asked to learn a number of national anthems, and we 
sang them. It was an extremely emotional experience. Many of these people were 
in terrible shape. They looked like walking skeletons, but they were beaming 
with joy as we entertained them." 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by such a reception, Von Sydow ignored his parents' plan for him to 
enter college and instead pursued an acting career. "I was in such a hurry to 
be an actor," he remembers. "Now I'm sometimes mad at myself that I didn't stop 
and study for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he attended Stockholm's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, began a stage 
career and then had the good fortune to meet Bergman. His work in the 
director's "The Seventh Seal," "The Magician" and "The Virgin Spring" brought 
him to the attention of Hollywood. In 1965, Von Sydow came to America to play 
Christ in "The Greatest Story Ever Told," and he has come back periodically 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the title role in "The Exorcist" and a small part in "Hannah and Her 
Sisters," as Barbara Hershey's intellectual lover, most of Von Sydow's work in 
Hollywood films has been villainous. "It's because I'm foreign," he explains in 
his ever-so-lightly accented English, Rand foreigners are very often villains." 
Since the success of "Pelle the Conqueror," an Oscar-winner in 1989 for best 
foreign film, Von Sydow thinks he has a new image in the United States. "Now 
I'm getting less villain offers and more normal people offers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even as his Hollywood career prospers, Von Sydow, who has lived in Rome and 
Paris for more than a decade, intends to move back to Sweden to pursue stage 
work. "If they want me, I'll do one limited theater engagement there every year 
and films the rest of the time," he says. "It's a daydream, but I hope it will 
work."

HORRIFYINGLY HOOPER;

<P>
'CHAINSAW' DIRECTOR SEEKS TO CUT A MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARE THESE DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE , Times Staff Writer

<P>
Tobe Hooper flipped a switch and a 10-foot projection screen smoothly rolled 
down from the ceiling in his Benedict Canyon home. He pulled from his stockpile 
of videocassettes a four-year-old episode he directed for Steven Spielberg's 
"Amazing Stories" TV series and inserted it into a tape machine. 
</P>
<P>
In moments, a 6-foot image of Weird Al Yankovich dressed as a green alien 
cabbage man materialized on screen. In a way, Weird Al was one of the more 
normal sights in Hooper's home. 
</P>
<P>
The horror director-whose latest work can be seen Wednesday at 9 p.m. on USA in 
a new film called "I'm Dangerous Tonight," starring Anthony Perkins and Madchen 
Amick-keeps strange mementos from his pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
Enshrined in a glass case is the meat hook from "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" 
(he says Spielberg has the other one). The dismembered hitchhiker corpse from 
the same movie sits in his living room. Then there's the steel mallet from "The 
Texas Chainsaw Massacre II," a staircase banister from "Salem's Lot" and a 
ceramic doll used in "Freddy's Nightmares." 
</P>
<P>
The props, most grotesque and out of place in the quiet suburban house, are 
tokens of an unassuming man whose paramour has always been film fantasy. His 
supernatural USA movie stars Perkins as an archeology professor who helps one 
of his students, Amick (Shelley of "Twin Peaks"), when she succumbs to the 
deadly powers of an ancient Aztec cloak. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the movies every day, sometimes twice a day, growing up," said 
Hooper, 47, who was raised in Austin and Dallas. Wearing a cap, T-shirt, jeans 
and shoes-all solid black-Hooper sat in his living room holding a stubby, 
unlighted cigar. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw everything," he continued. "I always figured I would be there one day 
making movies, because there really wasn't anything else I could do. That's all 
I thought about. That's all I dreamed about. I would talk my teachers at school 
into letting me turn in an 8mm film instead of written projects." 
</P>
<P>
When he was 25, the former University of Texas film student abandoned 
documentaries and TV commercials to make a feature film called "Eggshells." "We 
shot for about nine months," Hooper said, his soft-spoken words a contrast to 
his gravel-rock voice. "It was partly shot off a script written on a napkin and 
partly improvisational shooting." 
</P>
<P>
He paused and tried to light his cigar. It wouldn't light. He gave up and just 
held the cigar in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a film about hippies at the end of the Vietnam War," he continued, Rand 
they were living in a commune house that was also inhabited by this thing we 
called a crypto-embryonic-hyper-electric presence." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper said that the low-low-budget "Eggshells" played in only about 50 
theaters, but the horror element was a hit. "I learned what I had to do to get 
attention," he explained. "I was in Texas, 2,000 miles away from the center of 
activity in Los Angeles. I had to have a gimmick to get into any kind of 
stream, let alone the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
So Hooper co-wrote a script with Kim Henkel inspired by bloody events in 
Wisconsin, raised $155,000 from a consortium of good-ol'-boy businessmen and 
politicians in Austin and shot "Chainsaw Massacre" on 16mm film in the summer 
of 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The exploitation film, about a cannibalistic family who give new meaning to 
roadside kill, first went largely unnoticed, then became a cult classic, then 
spawned a hailstorm of imitations and now is hailed by some as a groundbreaking 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of slick B-horror films and the acclaimed TV miniseries "Salem's 
Lot," based on Stephen King's novel, Hooper's career peaked in 1982 when he 
directed the box-office hit "Poltergeist" for Spielberg, its co-writer and 
producer. But at a time when his career should have skyrocketed, the media 
climbed on Hooper's back and held him down with stories about Spielberg's 
creative influence overpowering the contributions of his meek director. 
</P>

It was almost a year before Hooper received another offer to direct. His next 
film, "Lifeforce" in 1985, was a biggish-budget movie for Cannon Films, about 
space vampires, that flopped in theaters. He directed another science-fiction 
movie, a remake of the 1953 3-D classic "Invaders From Mars," before turning 
again to horror with a messy sequel to "Chainsaw Massacre" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Hooper is developing two new feature films and a TV series, and hopes to 
shed the scaly reputation of a horror director. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been trying for many years to break out of that mold," Hooper said. "The 
face of horror is changing. I think we're about saturated with graphics. I 
definitely think it's taking a turn toward the psychological and emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper proudly went on to tell of an "Equalizer" episode he directed about the 
homeless. As he spoke he tried to light his cigar again. This time it stayed 
lit, and the red ember glowed brightly. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, no. I don't think so," Hooper responded when asked if he planned to 
retire one day soon. He shook his head and smiled as if he just heard an inside 
joke. "There's nothing else I want to do. This is all I've ever wanted to do. 
It's like play for me. Orson Welles said it best-making a movie is the best 
electric train a kid ever had."

Louis Malle's 1987 film is a wonderful companion piece to "Lacombe, Lucien," 
his 1973 drama of life under the Nazi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
In this superb semi-autobiographical film, a tale of innocence and betrayal set 
in a French provincial Catholic boarding school, Malle's grand, understated 
strategy reveals anti-Semitism deeply embedded in the society's social fabric. 
So flawless and overwhelming is "Au Revoir" that it is tempting to call it 
Malle's masterpiece. Pictured above are three Jewish students (from left, 
Raphael Fejto, Damien Salot and Arnaud Henriet) flanked by a priest who 
sheltered them (Philippe Morier-Genoud) and a German soldier. (Movie Channel

These two Czechoslovakian films, Oscar winners for best foreign film in 1966 
and 1965, respectively, exemplified what, at the time, was Eastern Europe's 
most vital film industry. 
</P>
<P>
Both are humanist, pacifist works set during World War II. Jiri Menzel's 
quirkier, more unclassifiable "Trains" is a wistful tragicomedy on the tangled 
love life of an assistant train dispatcher. Janos Kadar's "Shop" boasts a 
superb performance by Ida Kaminska (above, with Josef Kroner) as the old woman 
forced to cede her button shop to a clumsy non-Jewish outsider. (KCET Saturday 
at 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.) Michael Wilmington

TELL TV TIMES: WHICH ANCHOR PEOPLE DO YOU WATCH REGULARLY AND WHY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For this week's cover story, TV Times asked Los Angeles anchors, including 
KCOP's Warren Olney, below, what qualities they believe makes a good anchor. 
Now it's your turn. Which anchor people do you watch regularly and what 
qualities do you look for? Send responses to Tell TV Times, TV Times, Times 
Mirror Square, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053. Or fax them to (213) 237-7630. 
Letters must be signed with full name and address. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the responses to the July 15 question: Which TV family most closely 
resembles your family? 
</P>
<P>
My answer has to be the Steadmans of "thirtysomething." Our family is like the 
Steadmans because we -- unlike the Bundys of "Married . . . With Children" -- 
have compassionate and genuine concern for one another. Each member in our 
family helps each other through any hardship, tribulation and sadness that 
comes through in our life, just like the Steadmans. 
</P>
<P>
The Steadmans have the qualitative family life, which reflects love, honesty 
and warmth. Our family also has all that plus family loyalty and unity. We all 
do our part to make other members' lives better, such as helping in family 
business and housework, and we share our thoughts, concerns and complaints in 
orderly fashion to avoid hurting each other's feelings. 
</P>
<P>
April Shin, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
We're the Bundys of "Married . . . With Children." Life isn't a bowl of 
cherries for us or the Bundys. We have an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old so life 
can be crazy, strange and sometimes gets out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people we know can relate to the Bundys, even though they wouldn't 
admit it. 
</P>
<P>
Kathi Mathews, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
My family is closest to the Seavers on "Growing Pains." My mom looks so much 
like Maggie Seaver; she's even had people tell her about the resemblance many 
times. My dad has the same sort of humor as father Jason. My older brother is 
exactly like Mike Seaver because neither of them get good grades and they are 
always sneaking around. My little brother resembles Ben Seaver in the way that 
they are both so funny. I'm kind of like Carol Seaver because I get better 
grades than my brothers, and we get along with each other in a similar way.

HALL OF FAME IS THE NAME OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG, TIMES SPORTS COLUMNIST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is possible that television viewers watching Jim Palmer's induction into 
baseball's Hall of Fame Sunday won't recognize him with his pants on. 
</P>
<P>
Jim did well in pants, but better when he removed them, appearing in ads and 
commercials for years in his undergarment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crazy world," he confided. "I won 20 games eight times (for Baltimore). 
I won the Cy Young Award three times. And there was more written and said over 
my being seen in my Jockeys." 
</P>
<P>
Logic would dictate he appear in that attire at Cooperstown where, with his 
colleague, Joe Morgan, the two will be decorated in a sort of all-ESPN show. 
</P>
<P>
By that is meant Palmer and Morgan work as baseball analysts for ESPN, which 
will air the Hall of Fame telecast at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Of Morgan's 22 years in the majors, eight were spent in Cincinnati where he 
served from 1972 to 1978 as teammate of Pete Rose, for whom he fosters a soft 
spot today. 
</P>
<P>
"Making the Hall of Fame is the high point of my baseball life," Morgan says. 
"I am proud. I am ecstatic. I am also touched with guilt that I should get into 
the Hall so easily (on the first vote) while Pete is buried under so much 
trouble and must battle to get into the Hall at all." 
</P>
<P>
Rose isn't yet eligible for admittance, but when he is some argue that baseball 
shouldn't recognize a son who has bet on games. He also failed to pay income 
tax, an oversight that got him five months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete and I 'lockered' together for eight years," says Morgan. I don't think 
anyone in baseball knows him better than I do. I studied him on the field every 
day. He was the most dedicated player I've seen. I felt I was dedicated. But 
there were times I let up, as most players do. 
</P>
<P>
"But Pete? Never. He played every game as if it were the seventh game of the 
World Series. His lifetime ambition, his dream, his obsession, was to get into 
the Hall of Fame. Now it's anyone's guess." 
</P>
<P>
"If you voted," Morgan is asked, "what would be your verdict?" 
</P>
<P>
"You can't overlook his sins" he responds. "Tax fraud is serious business. And 
betting is against the rules. But I feel that what he did on the field, and 
what he did off the field, can be separated. There is also room for 
forgiveness. He never bet against his own team. He never threw a game. And tax 
problems needn't be related to baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"Then you would be more lenient than some of the voters indicate they will be?" 
</P>
<P>
"The same guys finger-wagging at Pete Rose will forgive drug-users, alcoholics, 
wife-beaters, cop-fighters and deadbeats. I hope they are equally charitable 
when Pete comes up for the Hall of Fame vote." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan confides he saw Palmer as an automatic selection for the Hall of Fame on 
the first ballot, but suffered serious misgivings about himself. 
</P>
<P>
"A pitcher is more visible than an infielder," says Morgan. "What an infielder 
does to win games for his team isn't always as obvious. My lifetime batting 
average ran only .271. And I got fewer than 3,000 hits." 
</P>
<P>
"Then what was your secret?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"My secret," he answers, "is that I did the right thing at the right time. It 
took a knowledgeable voter to realize this. And I am gratified that enough 
knowledgeable voters participated." 
</P>
<P>
Engaged in baseball on television since 1985, Morgan is new to ESPN, having 
previously served NBC, ABC and the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
Also a first-year man on ESPN, Palmer tilled an oar previously at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
If Morgan's glove is solicited for the Hall of Fame Museum, you have to assume 
a request will be made for Palmer's shorts. 
</P>
<P>
At department stores, Jim used to autograph them for women shoppers, who 
weren't especially in the market for a pair of shorts -- but hoped that Palmer 
went with them.

</P>
<P>
BEST-SELLING AUTHOR BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD LIVES THE GLAMOROUS LIFESTYLE OF 
HER CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing her well-stocked closet, Barbara Taylor Bradford is caught in a small, 
pleasurable dilemma: What to wear for the evening's dinner party -- the 
elegantly tailored dress designed by a Paris couturier, or the flirtatious 
red-skirted ensemble by her favorite New York designer? 
</P>
<P>
The multimillion-dollar author is deliberating over this embarrassment of 
riches in the living room of her bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of her latest best seller, her publisher, Random House, has 
flown her here on a VIP publicity trip. Her husband, producer Robert Bradford, 
who has transformed all but one of her novels into television miniseries, has 
jetted out to be by her side. Her personal publicist is on hand. And a press 
packet has been prepared, extolling her books' vital statistics: more than 30 
million copies sold in English-language editions and publication in 34 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
A household word in England, the British author of romance novels is also 
building her name -- and her fortune -- in the United States, where she has 
lived for more than 26 years. In an industry dominated by deep-pocketed 
corporations, Bradford is a guaranteed money-maker with whom publishers are 
making record-setting mega-deals. 
</P>
<P>
Her present book, "The Women in His Life," jumped into the No. 1 slot on 
British best-seller lists mere days behind the novel's June publication date. 
In a review of the book, the British newspaper the Evening Standard, noted, 
"While 'The Women in His Life' lacks the page-turning intensity of, for 
instance, 'A Woman of Substance,' the tightly knit plot is splendidly 
sustained." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in bookstores last Thursday in the United States, the work is the 
first product of a $10-million three-book contract, engineered by literary 
agent Morton Janklow. Janklow, who represents such authors as Jackie Collins, 
Judith Krantz and Danielle Steele, named his take-it-or-leave-it price to the 
publishers -- "no negotiations," Bradford says. And that was for U.S. and 
Canadian rights only. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the world is mine," Bradford says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The author is sitting on the bungalow's peach brocade couch (her favorite 
color) in a room fresh with flowers. At 57, Bradford is a handsome woman, 
coiffed and dressed with impeccable English order. Living the world-scale 
glamour her novels portray ("I write about places I know"), she unabashedly 
loves clothes, fine antiques, handsome men and expensive hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Her style is chit-chatty (she has a small chipped tooth, a wonderful Romanian 
manicurist and plans to redecorate her kitchen and dining room next year) and 
alternately decisive, in the manner of Margaret Thatcher, whom she much 
admires. Her conversation is heavily referenced with the names of the rich and 
powerful: her friend Hannah Pakula, director Alan Pakula's wife, who wrote 
about Elena Ceausescu in Vanity Fair; Queen Elizabeth's cousin, Lord Lichfield, 
who took her portrait, bedecked in emeralds, for her new novel's dust jacket; 
publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch and his wife, Anna; Spanish singer Julio 
Iglesias and, last but not least, the loyal steed of her world travels, the 
Concorde. (It bore her home from London two years ago when her fluffy white 
bichon frise, Gemmy, became temporarily paralyzed.) 
</P>
<P>
She and and her husband have just returned from a vacation in St. 
Jean-Cap-Ferrat on France's Cote d'Azur, which followed a three-week 
promotional tour through Britain. Relaxed, Bradford is again ready to talk 
about "The Women in His Life." 
</P>
<P>
The set piece of the room's coffee table, the book shimmers in its red jacket, 
with the author's name in "lapis royal blue purple," as Bradford describes it. 
She set out to re-create the colors from the packaging and graphics of Giorgio 
Beverly Hills' perfume Red, she says. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I want it to be packaged like cosmetics,' I told (Random House publisher) 
Joni Evans. 'I want it to have that look that somebody wants to reach for it.' 
Packaging is so important in selling perfume." 
</P>
<P>
But the principal reason that her books sell well is, as she states, "that I'm 
a brand name. When a book comes out, they grab it." 
</P>
<P>
The story now up for grabs is a departure from her panoramic sagas centered on 
strong-willed women, which began with her blockbuster, "A Woman of Substance," 
published in 1979. In "The Women in His Life," Bradford tells the tale of 
Maximilian West as his life sweeps by those of his mother, his nanny, and a 
trio of wives. A beautiful billionaire corporate raider, West is "power 
personified," a man who dashes about a world staged with marble mansions, women 
ready for seduction and corporations ripe for takeover. In a "This Is Your 
Life" ending, West comes to his senses, pleading in a post-epiphanic cri de 
coeur, "No more champagne"; he takes brandy instead. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the book's subject matter accurately reflects the author's 
interests. "I think finance is fascinating," Bradford says. "That's why I made 
'Maxim' a tycoon. Business and money interest me. Not money in the sense of 
something to spend, but as a monetary unit, a tool of industry." 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing historical drama, the book's action progresses from Kristallnacht, 
the first of the Nazi pogroms, on Nov. 9, 1938, to the dismantling of the 
Berlin Wall 51 years later. At its most informative, the novel recounts 
resistance to Hitler in Germany's upper social ranks and West's (shortened from 
Westheim) childhood escape from the country, which is loosely based on 
Bradford's husband's experiences as a German Jew fleeing Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of a strong Germany functioning within a European political 
framework, Bradford declares, "They've spent 45 years trying to expiate their 
crime. The Nazis only wanted power for the sake of having power; they didn't 
want it for economics. Germany is going to be the most dominant country in 
Europe, but not necessarily warlike." 
</P>
<P>
With the major exception of a nurturing nanny (Bradford's mother was a nanny 
before she married), the novel is less supportive of women, often depicting 
them as frivolous, (two New York working women are shown as egregious new-rich 
hustlers) and it assumes an ethical allegiance to the monied class. 
</P>
<P>
"The book has no message," Bradford says, adding: "It's a book people can read 
quite easily. I work very hard to make it easy to read, without descending into 
an infantile prose style." 
</P>
<P>
As for literature in general, she says, "You tell me someone who's writing 
literature today and I'll go buy the book." 
</P>
<P>
Examples are given. 
</P>
<P>
"But how many people read them?" she ask. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford's own desire to be a novelist began when she was a child growing up in 
Leeds, in the industrial north of England. The daughter of a machinery 
engineer, she says she was both spoiled and driven to make a success of 
herself. She sold her first short story at the age of 12 and later bypassed 
college to get on with a career as a journalist, working for a year as fashion 
editor of Woman's Own, a popular women's magazine, and interviewing celebrities 
for the large-circulation evening paper, the London Evening News. 
</P>
<P>
After her marriage, she moved to New York in 1964, and for 12 years wrote a 
syndicated newspaper column on interior design. Following four attempts at 
writing suspense novels, she turned to the saga, finding immediate success with 
"A Woman of Substance." In this best seller, Bradford's heroine, Emma Harte, 
rises from poverty in a small Yorkshire town to become the head of an 
international merchandising empire and one of the world's wealthiest women. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford resents press correlations of her frequently termed "rags-to-Vuitton" 
rise with that of Emma Harte. She says she "loathes" a profile published 
recently in the Sunday Times, which mentions "childhood deprivation" and 
describes her father as a "wooden-legged" former soldier. "His leg was made of 
aluminum," Bradford corrects, saying: "I come from an ordinary middle-class 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Like Harte, however, she admits she is a workhorse who starts at sunup and puts

walls of books contain such favorite novelists as Irwin Shaw and James Clavell, 
as well as Charles Dickens, the Bronte sisters and a biography of Winston 
Churchill. Her typing table is custom-made to blend with her Victorian desk;

She will be returning to their New York apartment ("47th floor overlooking the

beginning her next book in the fall, Bradford plans to take the rest of the 
summer off.

There will be time for lunch dates with pals such as Fran Weissler (Broadway 
producer with her husband, Barry, of "Gypsy" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," she 
notes) at restaurants such Le Cirque, the Russian Tea Room, and, she says after 
a second's consideration, "maybe some little place."

AN AWESOME ARSENAL OF TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To win an important award is an honor, the significance of which has been 
slowly diluted by the proliferation of media ceremonies. Today the rarest and 
most prestigious tributes go to the men and women who, in effect, have 
themselves become awards. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Lester Carter has just joined the elite group. Last month, at the 
Hollywood Bowl, the first annual "Benny" award, in the form of a bronze bust of 
Carter, commissioned by the American Federation of Jazz Societies and sculpted 
by the bassist-turned-artist John Heard, was presented to Carter. In future 
years it will go to others who come closest to matching his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Such artists will be hard to find. Carter today, instead of resting on the 
laurels accumulated during overlapping careers as saxophonist, composer, 
arranger, bandleader, songwriter, trumpeter and drafter of scores for 
television series and movies, remains as active as ever. He has just composed 
his first-ever extended piece for two vibraphones, to be premiered Tuesday 
evening at New York's Avery Fisher Hall, with Milt Jackson and Bobby Hutcherson 
in the featured roles. An hour after the concert ends, his 83rd birthday will 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm calling it 'Good Vibes,' " he said over tea at his Los Angeles home 
overlooking the Valley. "It will run from 30 to 40 minutes; the Classical Jazz 
Orchestra, a repertory ensemble, will perform it. Bobby Hutcherson will double 
on vibes and marimba, an instrument you don't hear often enough. It's a long 
the lines of the 'Kansas City Suite,' which I wrote for Count Basie in 1960 -- 
a swinging thing, with ballad and Latin interludes. We'll probably record the 
whole suite in a studio a few days later." 
</P>
<P>
Carter's recording career is in higher gear than ever. He is a guest soloist on 
a current album of his tunes recorded by pianist Marian McPartland, for 
Concord. Next month the session he recorded with Phil Woods, an alto 
saxophonist who came out of the Charlie Parker generation, will be issued by 
Music Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil is younger than my daughter," he says, "but age has never been an issue. 
I wrote a song called 'My Man Phil' -- words and music; I sang it on the record 
-- and he dedicated a number to me." 
</P>
<P>
Lyric writing is the newest addition to Carter's arsenal of talents. Over the 
years he has had such collaborators as Johnny Mercer ("A Kiss From You") and 
Sammy Cahn ("Only Trust Your Heart") but lately he has devoted himself to the 
serious study of how lyrics are devised. 
</P>
<P>
In the works now is a Benny Carter songbook album that will belatedly bring 
together, in vocal version on one CD, some of his best known standards, among 
them "Blues in My Heart" (1930), "When Lights are Low" (1936), "All That Jazz" 
(from the Sammy Davis movie "A Man Called Adam") and "Key Largo." 
</P>
<P>
Also due sooner or later is "Benny Carter: Symphony in Riffs," a 60-minute 
documentary that has been shown and praised in England while ironically an 
American release is still to be set. The film, narrated by Burt Lancaster, 
includes splendid evocations of Harlem in the '20s and of Carter's expatriate 
years and Hollywood movie successes. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's gift for melodic creation has been expressed most memorably through 
his improvisations on alto saxophone. The logic, symmetry and beauty of these 
solos set a standard that has never been outdated, despite the inroads of bop, 
modality, the avant-garde and whatever other movements have prevailed since his 
style was essentially set in the 1930s. His orchestral arrangements, 
particularly those of a five-piece sax section on such records as "Further 
Definitions" in the early 1960s, are paradigms of skill and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's writing has been interpreted with panache by musicians at a 
one-or-two-generation remove from him. Those who played in his orchestra at the 
recent Hollywood Bowl concert (and who will return when he shares a bill there 
with Ella Fitzgerald Aug. 22) range from musicians in their 30s (saxophonist 
Jeff Clayton and his bassist brother John) to others in their 60s, like the 
trombonist Buster Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
He has gone from being the youngest man in the band ("I was only 23 when I 
joined Fletcher Henderson") to becoming the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's longevity has enabled him to triumph over many obstacles -- most 
conspicuously racism, which he has opposed actively on many levels, whether it 
was fighting to retain ownership of a home in Hollywood against the objections 
of bigoted neighbors, or taking an active role in eliminating the segregated 
musicians' unions that long existed in Los Angeles, until the two combined in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's achievements in broadening the vocabulary of the music world he has 
inhabited for 65 years have involved most of jazz history's honored names: he 
has played with (or written arrangements or conducted for) Benny Goodman, Glenn 
Miller, Dizzy Gillespie, Django Reinhardt, Max Roach, Buddy Rich, Quincy Jones, 
Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Dexter Gordon, Coleman Hawkins -- not to 
mention Ella and Peggy and Sarah and Carmen and a constellation of other 
singers. He has outlived many contemporaries, but those who have survived are 
all good friends. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes hard to find a negative word to say about Benny Carter, to avoid the 
overtones of press agentry. For the record, then, let it be said that he was a 
co-composer of "Cow Cow Boogie," a song of which he is less than proud ("but it 
made a fair amount of money for me"), and that his singing is, well, not on the 
level of his other accomplishments. At that point the negatives have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The tributes, though, go on and on; just last month, with a thousand names from 
which to choose, an international panel of 64 jazz critics voted him Jazzman of 
the Year in a Down Beat poll. 
</P>
<P>
He has done it all and won them all -- what possible unrealized ambition can 
remain? 
</P>
<P>
"Easy," he said, "To live to be a hundred -- and in good health." 
</P>
<P>
Don't bet against it.

THE UP-AND-COMING BALLET DOWN UNDER; 
</P>
<P>
MAINA GIELGUD, ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE AUSTRALIAN BALLET, HAS NURTURED HER 
BROOD OF DANCERS WITH PRIDE AND A STRONG HAND 
</P>

<P>
During the 1970s, the Australian Ballet was known to Americans as a mostly 
anonymous ensemble dancing behind such big-name stars as Margot Fonteyn and 
Rudolf Nureyev. In fact, the last time the 28-year-old company performed in 
this country was in 1976, when it traveled with Fonteyn in Ronald Hynd's "The 
Merry Widow." 
</P>
<P>
When it returns this week to the Orange County Performing Arts Center, there 
will be no guest stars. Instead, the focus will be on the young talent nurtured 
by Maina Gielgud, the company's artistic director since 1983 -- talent in which 
she has such confidence that four different casts of "Giselle" will be fielded; 
talent that has scored successes during recent tours to such discriminating 
ballet capitals as Moscow and London. 
</P>
<P>
Gielgud inherited an established venture, but events leading up to her arrival 
created a situation in which she was rebuilding almost from scratch. During the 
late '70s and early '80s, directorial changes, financial instability and labor 
troubles that culminated in a dancers' strike created an unsettling environment 
in which many of the more established company members either retired or 
departed. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Ballet found the strong directorial hand it needed in Gielgud, a 
British-born ballerina who had recently stopped performing after an extensive 
and varied career that began at age 15. She is the niece of actor Sir John 
Gielgud, who early on tried to steer her away from ballet by telling her that 
it was "too much like hard work." 
</P>
<P>
She remained undaunted, studied with a variety of Russian teachers (she recalls 
being coached in mime by Tamara Karsavina), and began an international career 
that included stints with the companies of Roland Petit, the Marquis de Cuevas 
and Rosela Hightower. After four years with Maurice Bejart, she returned to a 
more classical repertory with London Festival Ballet (now the English National 
Ballet), where she was a principal dancer from 1972 to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The predilection for hard work that Gielgud demonstrated by ignoring her 
uncle's warning has remained with her, and she has earned a reputation as an 
extremely dedicated, energetic and demanding artistic director who is deeply 
involved in all aspects of her company. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in her New York hotel room (the current tour began with a 
week at the Metropolitan Opera House and continued with a week at the Kennedy 
Center), Gielgud described the situation she inherited in 1983. "There had been 
a succession of artistic directors, and there had been problems between the 
administration and the artistic direction -- they weren't working as a team. 
Six months after I arrived, the then-deputy administrator, Noel Pelly, was 
named administrator, and we've had a really excellent relationship. It's 
important to have the two areas working towards the same aims, understanding 
each other's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of dancers had left the year before I came, and I inherited a company 
of, for the most part, very young dancers. So it's really been a developmental 
process for these dancers, and over four or five years, they rushed through the 
ranks." 
</P>
<P>
"Maina coincided with a whole new generation of dancers," notes company member 
Stephen Baynes, whose ballet "Catalyst" will be on the opening-night program, 
preceding "Giselle." He joined the Australian Ballet in 1976, went to the 
Stuttgart Ballet during the early '80s, and returned in 1985 when good reports 
of Gielgud's invigorating influence on the troupe reached him. 
</P>
<P>
"She really had the job of building it up from scratch, but there were good 
foundations there," Baynes said. "The school was very well established by then, 
so she could draw on it for new dancers." 
</P>
<P>
The school, founded in 1964, two years after Peggy van Praagh founded the 
Australian Ballet, holds auditions throughout the country and provides up to 
85% of the company's dancers, Gielgud estimates. The company and school share a 
new facility in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
Van Praagh, a British dancer who originated roles in several Antony Tudor 
masterworks during the 1930s and later danced with the Sadlers Wells Ballet, 
came to Australia at the recommendation of Sadlers Wells founder Ninette de 
Valois. 
</P>
<P>
"(Van Praagh) gave the company a very solid foundation as far as repertoire is 
concerned, and she was also an excellent teacher," Gielgud says. "She brought 
the big classical productions (Nureyev's "Don Quixote," her own "Giselle" and 
"Coppelia"), several full-length Cranko ballets and one-act works by Ashton, 
Balanchine, Robbins and others." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Helpmann, the Australian-born dancer who achieved great fame with the 
Royal Ballet in the '40s and '50s, became closely associated with the company, 
assisting Van Praagh from 1965 on. Tudor choreographed "The Divine Horseman" 
and staged his "Pillar of Fire" for the company in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Gielgud has added her own productions of "Sleeping Beauty" and "Giselle" to the 
repertoire, as well as Cranko's "Taming of the Shrew," Tetley's "Voluntaries" 
and some Kylian works. New productions scheduled for the coming year include 
Balanchine's "Apollo," Nijinska's "Les Biches" and Tudor's "The Leaves Are 
Fading" and "Gala Performance." 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to bring the ballets that I thought would suit the dancers -- 
develop them and show them off," Gielgud explains. "I've kept the balance 
between contemporary and classical, continued bringing in the best works being 
done for other companies while also having works created on the company. That 
side of things is growing now, because I think the dancers have a solid enough 
foundation." 
</P>
<P>
She reintroduced a choreographic workshop project that had fallen by the 
wayside, and it is through these workshops that Baynes' abilities became 
evident. After several works choreographed under workshop auspices, "Catalyst," 
which is set to Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos, is his first commissioned 
work. It premiered last May and is receiving its American premiere in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Poulenc's music is very colorful and vibrant. I've known the Concerto for a 
long time and always wanted to choreograph it," the lanky, thoughtful Baynes 
remarked backstage at the Met between rehearsals. As a coryphee with the 
company (the 60 dancers are divided into a hierarchy of six ranks), he is 
performing in most of the tour repertory while also preparing his own ballet. 
</P>
<P>
On the podium conducting both "Catalyst" and "Giselle" will be someone whom 
longtime balletgoers will find familiar: John Lanchbery, who was ABT's music 
director in the late 1970s and is now the Australian Ballet's principal guest 
conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"Catalyst" joins Gielgud's "Giselle" on the first program; the second program 
is a triple bill made up of Serge Lifar's "Suite en blanc", a rarely seen 1943 
work created for the Paris Opera Ballet; Kylian's "Return to the Strange Land," 
an elegiac series of pas de trois and pas de deux set to Janacek piano pieces 
(the Joffrey performed it starting in the early '80s); and David Lichine's 
"Graduation Ball," a frothy 1940s bonbon in which cadets and young girls (some 
naughty, some nice) join forces under the watchful eye of a comic headmistress. 
</P>
<P>
The "Giselle" production, first staged in 1986, aims to be a traditional one, 
emphasizing the Romantic style. Subtle but significant dramatic details are 
included in the first act, which, in Peter Farmer's design, features a palette 
of autumnal browns, yellows, oranges and golds. The second act's wilis are an 
especially haunting, fierce band of betrayed maidens, entering eerily from the 
furthest upstage reaches. 
</P>
<P>
Gielgud was eager to revive "Suite en blanc," which Lifar first set on the 
Australian Ballet before Gielgud arrived. "It's a very good display piece for 
the company, she says." 
</P>
<P>
The series of solos, pas de trois and pas de deux are framed by an ensemble 
architecturally arranged on two staircases and a raised platform and are set to 
music by Edouard Lalo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ballet that I know extremely well because I danced it from my teens 
on," Gielgud notes. "I've done almost every soloist and principal role in it 
and worked with Lifar on it. I found that it suits the company extremely well. 
It displays their virtuosity and their understanding of neoclassical style." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the gentle, somewhat reserved tones in which she speaks, Gielgud's 
pride and confidence in her dancers are evident. So is her determination to 
make Australian dancers, who have tended to retire by 30, pursue longer 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
"Dancing is regarded in Australia as something you do in your 20s," she says 
regretfully. "Then you go on to a 'proper career.' I think they miss out on 
their years of maturity; they're not fulfilling their potential. Also, the 
younger dancers don't have role models." 
</P>
<P>
She hopes she can create a working environment where this trend will change, 
and dancers will perform for longer stretches. The youthful Australian Ballet 
has principal dancers nearly all of whom are between 25 and 28 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"So I won't know for five or 10 years if I've been successful," Gielgud says 
with a slight laugh. "We'll see what happens."

<TEXT>
<P>
ABOUT midway through Jack Nicholson's "The Two Jakes," the long-delayed and 
much-anticipated sequel to "Chinatown," private eye Jake Gittes finds himself 
on the defensive end of a one-on-one sexual fast break by the stunning widow of 
a man his client is suspected of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to make me do it, Jake?" asks the feverish Lillian Bodine 
(played by Madeleine Stowe) in a voice that tells him exactly how to respond. 
"Yeah, yeah, I'm going to make you do it," Jake says, his back to the water 
cooler in his office. 
</P>
<P>
But first, he needs a break. Some time to think about it. This isn't the same 
young Jake of "Chinatown," the impulsive ex-cop who stuck his nose out so far 
he almost got it cut off. Eleven years have passed since he got to the last act 
of that story of greed, incest and betrayal, and a lot has happened, to him and 
to America. 
</P>
<P>
It is now 1948, and Jake is a decorated war veteran running a thriving business 
in boom-town Los Angeles. The years, the war and his memories have altered him; 
his face is as lined as a dry bean field, and a lot of good meals have come to 
rest just above his belt. Soaring domestic infidelity and a rich clientele of 
betrayed lovers are paying for a lifestyle that includes a membership in the 
exclusive Wilshire Country Club, dinners at swank Perino's restaurant and the 
sleek gray Hudson convertible that gets him back and forth from his home in the 
hills to the Streamline Moderne headquarters of Gittes Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
And now Jake is in a very interesting situation, facing not one but two 
conflicts of interest. Does he satisfy this woman he barely knows and risk the 
interests of his client? Does he stick around and get rug burns while his 
faithful fiancee dines alone? No prompting from the audience, please. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that after all these years Jake is still Jake. But that he 
hesitates at all is a sign -- at least to the star and director of the movie -- 
that he is no longer the hair-trigger guy he was before the war. Those years in 
Naval Intelligence have made him at least consider the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"The old Jake would have done it different, that's for sure," Nicholson says, 
with a grin that roars with mischief. "He's a little calmer now, a little less 
quick to fly." 
</P>
<P>
"THE TWO JAKES"is called that because Gittes' client and adversary is also 
named Jake. But the two Jakes that Nicholson talks about are the same guy a 
decade removed. The movie is laced with incidents like the one above, in which 
the changes in Jake are apparent but not remarkable. "I like that element of 
this film, that part of the story is told by how you have the characters 
change," Nicholson says. "Gittes is still the same guy, but the fact that 
events have changed him is actually a literary element of the movie. This is 
not the same guy who jumped out of a barber's chair and went nuts." 
</P>
<P>
When it's pointed out that one key scene ends in a wild brawl, with Jake 
shoving a pistol in a cop's mouth, Nicholson says, "Yeah, well, you can change 
some of your spots, but not all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicholson, now 53, seems a little calmer, too, a little less quick to fly. 
As the director of "The Two Jakes," he hesitated at the water cooler himself. 
He actually shot part of the lovemaking between Jake and Lillian, but the man 
who -- on a breadboard with Jessica Lange in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" 
-- gave the '80s one of its steamiest sex scenes, restrained himself and cut 
from Jake pondering his opportunity to the morning after he'd enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
Friends who've known him throughout his career say Nicholson has mellowed, 
become more confident and assured, and Nicholson agrees. He says he's more 
reflective about life and, in fact, worked a favorite theme of his -- that the 
past can be neither shaken nor ignored -- into Robert Towne's script for "The 
Two Jakes." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson makes no apologies and says he has no regrets, except for having been 
so open about his views on sex and drugs in interviews over the years. "I put a 
certain amount of effort into being a good interview because it was better for 
all of us," he admits of that period when he courted his bad-boy image. "When 
you're younger, you get so tired of these pat phrases. . . . It's also another 
area of communications. I thought, 'Let's open it up a little.' You can't do 
that now; there's too much misinformation out there." 
</P>
<P>
More than that of any other star, Nicholson's off-screen personality seems to 
match the nature of his on-screen roles. The expressions, mannerisms, speech 
patterns -- the way his lips purse and his eyebrows arch -- are similar as 
well. There has been something both charismatic and aloof about most of the 
people he has played, an explosive charge that is both exhilarating to watch 
and fearsome to ponder. As a movie star, he has ignored conventional wisdom and 
taken supporting roles, then put vanity on the run by growing an ample paunch 
and allowing it to be shot in naked profile at the outset of a love scene (with 
Shirley MacLaine in "Terms of Endearment"). 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson has created some of the most comic and most dramatic moments on film, 
often in the same movie, sometimes in the same scene. (Recall his tantrum when 
a bartender refused to serve underage seaman Randy Quaid in "The Last 
Detail"?). And the wild side that came through in his early interviews -- his 
storied appetite for sex and pot, his aggressive iconoclasm, his humor -- all 
added up to something irrepressible. 
</P>
<P>
The actor and sometime director has lived his life in the public eye, at least 
during the 21 years since being vaulted into stardom by "Easy Rider." His 
friendships, his long romance with Anjelica Huston and their recent parting, 
even his discovery a few years ago that the woman he thought was his mother was 
actually his grandmother and that his real mother was his older sister, June, 
have been played out publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Nicholson says he has matured in some of the ways that Jake Gittes did 
between "Chinatown" and "The Two Jakes." "Sure, I think there's a parallel," he 
says. "I think there would be a parallel with the majority of people. You get 
older, you do change." 
</P>
<P>
The thing that Jake comes to understand -- that the past won't go away -- was 
Nicholson's motto for the '80s, he says. "People used to talk about going to 
the Bahamas or some other exotic place to get away from it all. There is no 
away anymore. No matter where you go in the shrinking global community, you run 
into your past. Somebody will say, 'Hey, I never expected to see you here.' 
You've got to deal with it without running away." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson is guarded about himself these days; he is much less the maverick. 
The iconoclast has become an icon, the personification of creative power in a 
town that reveres it, and though he drops bits of personal gossip into his 
conversation, it seems more an act of habit than intention. He brings up his 
4-month-old daughter and her mother, actress Rebecca Broussard, and talks about 
his trips down the hill to see them, of how looking into the face of his own 
child "obliterates all the minor chords in life." Later, when asked what the 
girl's name is, he answers "Lorraine," then snaps, "Doesn't anybody want to 
talk about film anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
So, if his life isn't quite the open copy of High Times it once seemed, there 
are clues wherever you look. As he says, "Life can only be understood in 
retrospect; you can only get a picture of it when you look back." Since Jake 
Gittes bears an admittedly personal stamp, is it fair to conclude that, when an 
actor has been in charge of his career as long as he has, he is inevitably the 
sum of his parts -- and that Jack Nicholson is exactly who we think he is?

"Well, that's fair in my case, as long as you realize I play a lot of deceptive 
characters," he says. "I like the disguise element of the theatrical 
profession. But yeah, everything counts in the existential sense. What you 
choose to do has to do with who you are. If you saw my work and met me, you 
wouldn't be shocked. You can certainly say that." 
</P>

NICHOLSON LIVES on the ridge of the Hollywood Hills in a house that has been 
described so often that it seems a part of his personality. It's the middle 
house of three in a sloping, gated compound off Mulholland Drive. After you 
enter the front gate, the road forks twice, the first right leading to Marlon 
Brando's house where, one night in May, Brando's son Christian shot to death 
the boyfriend of his half-sister, Cheyenne. The next fork leads left to a house 
that Nicholson owns but leases to a prosperous businessman and right to the 
house of popular lore. It was here, while Nicholson was away, that director 
Roman Polanski had felonious sex with a 13-year-old girl, which led to his 
eventual flight from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The unremarkable split-level stucco house, built in the early '50s by an IBM 
executive with an architectural background, defies the millions it must be 
worth. The interior seems rumpled, well lived in, and though there is wealth in 
the artwork, it is hardly arranged for impact. On this particular evening, a 
lone Picasso rests on the hearth. 
</P>
<P>
The view and the solitude are what attracted Nicholson's attention 20 years 
ago, and the view and solitude are the reasons he says he stays. From the front 
of his house, the hills fall away to the floor of the Valley and to the 
mountains beyond; on the other side of the pool lies the L. A. basin, west to 
the ocean. The location has rooted Nicholson in what he declares the heart of 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"If you laid L. A. out the way Manhattan is laid out, this is 55th and Fifth 
Avenue," he says, holding his arms out. "This is dead center L. A. I've lived 
here a long time, and I haven't any desire to move." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, like Randy Newman, loves L. A.: "Mad about it," he says. He looks 
out over the rolling hills and watches the mists roll up the canyons. "When 
it's pure white, it's the regular stuff that makes L. A. beautiful. The desert 
by the ocean. I can't look out my back window with the same degree of ocular 
naivete that I had when I moved in here. I know what's out there, that mountain 
and that one and another that may be 12 miles beyond. People comically impugn 
the L. A. sensibility. They think it's kookie. But it's based on breadth. We 
have an open view of things that comes out of the topography." 
</P>
<P>
You can get a glimpse of Nicholson's house in "The Two Jakes." He used it for 
scenes set in Jake's house. His and Jake's tastes are similar in some respects; 
Jake loves L. A., too, which is the autobiographical element of the series that 
appealed to Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
Years before "Chinatown" was made, Nicholson and Towne planned a trilogy of 
mystery stories that would deal with the ecological milestones in Los Angeles 
-- the scheme to bring in water from the Owens Valley, the draining of the oil 
fields beneath the city and the pollution of the air above. "Chinatown" took 
care of the water, and "The Two Jakes" deals with oil. But the third film, 
which was to have been set in 1959, will never be made because the series' 
creative team -- Nicholson and Towne -- had a falling out over the making of 
the second one (see sidebar). 
</P>
<P>
The air on this summer night is uncharacteristically clear atop Mullholland 
Drive. There is no mist, brown or white, and the valley floors on both sides 
are luminous. Inside, some unseen speakers are alternately pumping out 
progressive jazz and early Sinatra as Nicholson finishes off some thin brown 
liquid that is part of a diet plan that has him down to his lowest weight in a 
decade. Despite his diet and a physical regimen that includes mountain climbs 
near his second home in Aspen, he manages to go only 10 or 15 minutes between 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson refers to key people in his life by their first names, and listeners 
have to sort them out in their own mental files. Some are obvious: friends and 
neighbors Warren and Marlon, former lover Anjelica. Others aren't. John is the 
late John Huston, Mike is director Mike Nichols, for whom Nicholson worked in 
"Carnal Knowledge," "The Fortune" and "Heartburn." Rebecca is Rebecca 
Broussard, the mother of his new baby and also the actress who plays his 
secretary in "The Two Jakes." Bobby is "The Two Jakes" co-producer Robert 
Evans. Robert is screenwriter Towne. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these names pop up in connection with questions about problems with 
"The Two Jakes." Nicholson would like to talk about the movie, which marks his 
third outing as a director, but in its refusal to show the film until these 
interviews were almost over, Paramount Pictures unintentionally forced the 
film's tangled past into the foreground. "The Two Jakes" fell out of production 
five years ago when Nicholson, Evans and Towne failed to solve a creative 
crisis. And following reports that scenes were being reshot long after filming 
ended, the current version has had its release date shoved back from last 
Christmas to March and then to midsummer. It will open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson says the studio knew that Christmas was never a realistic target and 
insists that the film, which reportedly cost about $25 million, came in 
"perfectly on schedule and perfectly on budget. I think it's the first 
(Paramount) film in four or five years to do so." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing that people are going to notice about "The Two Jakes" is how 
unflatteringly the director shot himself. Jake Gittes is heftier by about 30 
pounds, and though the film is set just 11 years later, each of the 16 years 
that have actually passed are carved in the actor's face. "I would have shot 
for the weight that I am now if I could have, but now I'm glad I didn't," he 
says. "I think it's better this way. It says more about the difference. Jake 
was lean and mean then; he should be just a little comfortable now." 
</P>
<P>
The story of "The Two Jakes" is tightly interwoven into the fabric of 
"Chinatown," which itself was an intricately plotted story. There are several 
flashbacks to the first movie, and a scene where Jake, his eyes brimming with 
tears, thumbs through a file of old photos and newspaper clippings reminds him 
(and us) of the way "Chinatown" ended, with Evelyn Mulwray (the Faye Dunaway 
character) being shot to death by police. 
</P>
<P>
The sequel co-stars Harvey Keitel as the other Jake, a real estate developer 
who catches his wife (Meg Tilly) in flagrante delicto with his partner and 
kills him, a crime of passion that makes him both the sole beneficiary of the 
business and the chief suspect in what Jake thinks was a setup murder. But this 
is the easy stuff; the story also weaves its way through land-grant and 
mineral-rights records, the La Brea Tar Pits, gay bars -- even Chinatown. The 
opening scene, in which Jake Berman's doomed partner utters the name Katherine 
Mulwray (the illegitimate daughter of Evelyn and her dad in "Chinatown"), tips 
us to the long and winding trail that Jake will take us down. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson worries about the dense weave of his film but thinks it makes nice 
counterprogramming in a summer boiling with simplistic action films. "This 
movie children aren't going to come back 10 and 11 times to see, so it's out of 
the megagross category to begin with. (Studios) don't want you to say this, but 
the fact of the matter is, this is a demanding movie; it requires the 
involvement of the audience. There aren't a lot of popcorn stops in it. This is 
a real movie." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson directed only two pictures before this one -- the message-ridden 1972 
counterculture film "Drive, He Said" and the 1978 Western lark "Goin' South" -- 
so critics will have little with which to compare his behind-the-camera work. 
Stylistically, Nicholson's three films share very little, but people who worked 
on "The Two Jakes" say he was an assured leader on the set even though his 
storied geniality slipped occasionally into outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was incredibly serious about the work," says Meg Tilly. "Sometimes he 
stayed up till 5 in the morning rewriting a scene and would get three hours 
sleep. I didn't believe he would make it to the set. But when he did, he would 
give me more than any actor ever did and more than any director." 
</P>
<P>
Tracey Walker, a character actor who worked on "Goin' South" and "The Two 
Jakes," says it was a different Nicholson behind the camera this time out. "He 
is unquestionably more confident. He's much more relaxed; it comes across." If 
Nicholson has been influenced by anyone, it's probably Michelangelo Antonioni, 
for whom he worked in "The Passenger." Nicholson speaks in reverent tones about 
Antonioni, saying that the Italian director has even changed the way he views 
the world. "I'm dedicated to the man, I think he's fabulous." Nicholson says 
he's considering a script that Antonioni wants to direct, but won't make a 
decision about his next project until "The Two Jakes" is out and done with. "I 
want a real punctuation mark to this film. Then I can look ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson says the detective genre makes certain demands that take choice out 
of the director's hands. "The classic style of most detective stories is to let 
the audience see what the detective sees. So we shot with a lot of camera 
angles from behind. I didn't try to duplicate the look of 'Chinatown,' but they 
share a lot of similarities in that sense." 
</P>
<P>
Both films have the benefit of brilliant cinematographers -- John Alonso on 
"Chinatown," Vilmos Zsigmond on "The Two Jakes" -- but the look of a film is 
the director's choice, and Nicholson's film looks much different from Roman 
Polanski's. Perhaps because he is both director and Jake Gittes, he gives us a 
story that is told almost literally through the eyes of the detective. We look 
down his legs at his shoes, over his shoulder as he drives through town, 
through the viewfinder of his camera. If he had visited a urinal, the movie 
would have been X-rated. 
</P>
<P>
HEADLINE WRITERS are going to come up with a lot of "Two Jacks" headlines for 
reviews of the movie -- Jack the actor and Jack the star. But when you look at 
Nicholson's life and career, you can draw several pairs of Jacks out of the 
deck. The pre-"Easy Rider" Jack and the post-"Easy Rider" Jack. The wild and 
crazy young Jack, the laid-back middle-age Jack. Jack the romantic and the 
Jack-of-all-babes. 
</P>
<P>
Before "Easy Rider" in 1969, Nicholson was a B actor with a long list of 
credits in Westerns, horror films and biker movies. Since "Easy Rider," he has 
been a superstar with his pick of projects. He went from almost nothing to 
almost everything in one extraordinary leap, and he remembers the precise 
moment it happened -- midway through the premiere of "Easy Rider" at the 1969 
Cannes Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been to Cannes a couple of times before, and I knew that place like a 
guttersnipe," he says. "I was a back-street movie hustler, and I could smell it 
when something really big was going on. I had been around long enough to know 
that while I was sitting in that audience, I had become a movie star. Nobody's 
ever had that experience, I don't think." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, who grew up in what are called "modest circumstances" in Neptune, N. 
J., moved to Los Angeles in 1954. "For the first year and a half, all I did was 
go to the beach, go to the track and shoot pool. It was great, just like home." 
He soon became interested in acting and joined a class taught by Jeff Corey. 
Among his classmates were Robert Towne and two other future authors of 
Nicholson movies: Carol Eastman, who would write "Five Easy Pieces," and John 
Shanner, who would write "Goin' South." 
</P>
<P>
By the time of "Easy Rider," Nicholson had appeared in nearly 20 movies, had 
written two screenplays himself and was signed to direct his first film. He 
says now that he didn't consider himself a failure at that time -- "any actor 
who has worked steadily for 10 years has achieved some sort of success" -- but 
his career had dead-ended in a way that surprised even his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not that self-assured in the beginning," says Roger Corman, who 
produced Nicholson's debut film, "The Cry Baby Killer." "He had that 
flamboyance from the beginning, but he was not convinced he would be 
recognized." 
</P>
<P>
"Jack went through an extraordinary period of failure when he was about 30," 
says Bob Rafelson, a Nicholson contemporary who directed him in the 1968 
"Head," a film Nicholson wrote and which starred the TV rock group the Monkees. 
"He was co-starring, not being featured prominently. He didn't believe he'd be 
discovered for his talents. I said, 'Jack, the next thing I do after the 
Monkees will be with you.' " Sure enough, Rafelson's next film, "Five Easy 
Pieces," was with Nicholson. But by then, Nicholson was a superstar and 
Rafelson was the one who could use the help. 
</P>
<P>
Once he had the power, Nicholson knew what he wanted to do with it -- go to 
work for the best directors in the world. He starred in "Carnal Knowledge" for 
Mike Nichols, "The Last Detail" for Hal Ashby, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's 
Nest" for Milos Forman, "Chinatown" for Polanski, "The Shining" for Stanley 
Kubrick and, eventually, "Prizzi's Honor" for John Huston. He's been nominated 
for Oscars nine times and has won twice (as best actor for "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest" and best supporting actor for "Terms of Endearment"). 
</P>
<P>
Even in those Nicholson movies that were badly reviewed, Nicholson came off 
well. The only time critics ganged up on him in any meaningful number was on 
the 1978 "Goin' South," in which he directed himself playing a bearded jackal 
who reminded a lot of the reviewers of a young Gabby Hayes. Almost all of his 
films have made money for their backers, and one of them -- last summer's 
"Batman" -- hit the stratosphere, grossing more than $425 million worldwide and 
guaranteeing him a reported $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
NICHOLSON HAS established a hefty body of work for critics and armchair 
analysts to examine: 27 movies since "Easy Rider," and he chose the 27 he 
wanted to do. "Absolutely my choice, every one of them," he says. "Since life 
tends to imitate art, I guess you could look at (the films) en masse, and it 
would be almost innately autobiographical." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, specifically autobiographical. "Five Easy Pieces" was written 
for the actor by his former acting-school classmate Eastman, who captured his 
fascination with disguise. "What I liked about that film was that the character 
was posing as a hick rough-and-tumble worker who in fact was a concert pianist, 
and he just dropped the disguise in the middle of it. After 'Easy Rider,' a lot 
of people thought I was a Southerner. When the character goes home and drops 
that accent, that seemed autobiographical to me." 
</P>
<P>
It's tricky business sorting through performances and trying to decide whether 
a characteristic was put there by Nicholson or absorbed by him. "Carnal 
Knowledge," in which he portrayed a man obsessed with sexual conquest, had a 
lot to do with his reputation as a womanizer. "I knew 'Carnal Knowledge' was a 
risky character. I sort of was savvy enough to know that women weren't going to 
like me for a year or two," he says. "But doing things that other people didn't 
want to do is a risk factor that's been appealing to me in a lot of my 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson denies any autobiographical link to that character but does admit 
that the philanderer he played in "Heartburn" had personal reference. "There's 
something autobiographical in a man who might do something as heinous as buy a 
woman a bracelet while his wife is pregnant," he says. "This may be grounds for 
execution in most people's minds, but we wouldn't have many men left if these 
executions were carried out. The rogue male is a character the audience just 
won't buy. You can have a mass murderer get away scot free, but not some guy 
who's (fooling) around." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, there was real heartburn in Nicholson's life when word of 
Broussard's pregnancy got to Anjelica Huston, with whom he'd shared some sort 
of relationship for 17 years. In a recent Vanity Fair cover story, Huston 
talked about the pain of dealing with Nicholson's philandering and of learning 
that another woman was having his baby. She also talked of the frustration of 
life in the shadows of two of Hollywood's legendary men -- Nicholson and her 
father, the late director John Huston. The three of them had teamed up for 
"Prizzi's Honor," a 1985 Mafia comedy that won an Oscar for Huston. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson takes credit for advancing her career, first by getting her a showy 
part in "The Postman Always Rings Twice," then by making "Prizzi's Honor" 
happen by simply agreeing to star in it. Nicholson thinks the article left the 
impression that he was responsible for her years of professional unfulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a myth there, and I'm sure Anjelica's not creating it," he says. "I've 
somehow become a character who was repressive of her career. I may not have 
wanted to have been in an intimate relationship with another theatrical 
personality, true enough. However, with the great good fortune I've had in my 
career, I'd be the last person to tell someone who wants to be an actor not 
to." Huston had no interest in responding further, but a mutual friend 
confirmed that "Anjelica said ciao to Jack" after learning about the baby. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Nicholson seems to be enjoying his role as a new father. "It's the 
greatest experience in life," he says, his lips curling at the corners. "I got 
that feeling when Jenny was born, but it's even greater. I have less fears 
about life now than I did then." 
</P>
<P>
From 1961 to 1966, Nicholson was married to actress Sandra Knight, another 
classmate at Jeff Corey's acting school. Jennifer, his 26-year-old daughter 
from that marriage, is now studying with Corey and has been working on films 
(including "The Two Jakes") as a production-design assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer says she has always been on great terms with her dad. She spends a lot 
of time with Nicholson, Broussard and the baby, who she says looks like her own 
baby pictures come to life. She says she's glad her father's life has been a 
public performance; reading about it depersonalized the events and eased the 
shock. "Everybody knows all the family secrets, so you're not attached to them, 
and they don't bother you so much." And of his reputation as a ladies' man? "He 
is a sweet and good man, and he knows how to treat a woman, and that includes 
me," she says. "He has always treated me in a very feminine way." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer, too, says she thinks her father is calmer now -- but he's never been 
as wild as people think. "That's the question I always get: 'Is your dad 
crazy?' The answer is no, he's not crazy, but he pretends to be." 
</P>
<P>
NICHOLSON'S professional and personal lives have revolved in large part around 
relationships that he established two and three decades ago. For an actor who 
has turned the rootless drifter into a signature character, he seems remarkably 
rooted. Same house for 20 years, same agent for 30, same publicist since "Easy 
Rider." He says he never does favors for anyone, but talk long enough to him 
and "friendly decisions" pop up. 
</P>
<P>
He turned down the role of Michael Corleone in "The Godfather" to appear in pal 
Rafelson's "The King of Marvin Gardens." Later, he let Warren Beatty talk him 
into playing Eugene O'Neill in "Reds" even though he felt ill-suited to the 
role. He agreed to play the network TV anchorman in "Broadcast News" because 
James L. Brooks asked him to, even though it involved a personal ban on roles 
that simply require Jack Nicholson the star. When Rafelson was removed from the 
film "Brubaker," Nicholson helped ease the sting by immediately going to work 
with him on "The Postman Always Rings Twice." 
</P>
<P>
"People who are willing to fly with him find an incredible spirit," says Mary 
Steenburgen, whose career was airlifted out of anonymity by her role opposite 
Nicholson in "Goin' South." "He has a mixture of modern and old-fashioned 
qualities. One of the old-fashioned ones is his dedication to friendships." 
</P>
<P>
Being a man of excess has its rewards: Money, cars, houses (Nicholson says "I 
own a lot of them" but refuses to elaborate), friends and as many dalliances as 
one needs to quench the fires below. So rootlessness doesn't quite explain him. 
"I know the quality you're describing," he says, as the probing pushes his 
patience. "I'm a drifter, but I'm not rootless. I think what you're calling 
rootlessness, I would just call being in flux." 
</P>
<P>
The movie that seems to connect Nicholson most closely with his personal roots 
is "Ironweed," perhaps his least-seen work. The 1988 film, adapted by William 
Kennedy from his own novel, is about a former major-league baseball player who 
has become an urban bum haunted by his past. It is set in Albany, N. Y., in 
1938, the year after Nicholson was born, and in it he plays a character with 
strong parallels to the man he still refers to as his father even though it has 
since been revealed that he was Nicholson's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I always just called him Jack," Nicholson says. "He was a great baseball 
player in the late '20s and early '30s. I don't know this firsthand, of course, 
but Ma always said he never took a drink until Prohibition was over. Then one 
day, after the firehouse baseball game, he got drunk on apricot brandy and 
never stopped drinking. Never, never stopped. He started drinking in his 
mid-30s and died in his mid-50s. I remember the first outing I ever went on 
alone with him was up to the Polo Grounds. I saw Mel Ott hit a home run. I saw 
Bill Nicholson, my namesake, park one. It was the Giants and the Cubs. We were 
both Yankee fans, but they weren't in town. Yeah, 'Ironweed' was close to the 
bone." 
</P>
<P>
Things have brightened up considerably since "Ironweed." Nicholson went from 
there to "Batman," acting up a storm in the role of a man who was able to put a 
happy face on an acid bath, and to "The Two Jakes." And while Robert Towne 
wrote the script, the star and director shaped it in his own image. Jake and 
Jack, homeboys in L.A. looking ahead with an eye to the past. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there's something about Jake that doesn't square with Jack at all; it's 
that 6 handicap at the Wilshire Country Club. There's a scene in the movie 
where the two Jakes meet on a golf course and discuss business while having a 
tensely competitive match. When Nicholson's Jake tees off, his swing isn't 
grooved like a 6 -- more like a 36. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only played a couple of rounds of golf in my life," says Nicholson, 
adding that he's taking lessons and getting serious about the game. "It's going 
to become one of my main activities. It's a divinely infuriating activity that 
teaches you patience and inner poise." 
</P>
<P>
That may be too much. A devil, an astronaut, a madman, a gangster, a drifter, 
even a network anchorman, OK. But Jack Nicholson a golfer? Nobody will believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think so?" he asks, breaking into that $60-million smile. "Well, 
that's what I am."

ATHOL FUGARD: S. AFRICA IS ALWAYS WITH HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an entry from his published "Notebooks, 1960-1977," Athol Fugard comes up 
with a seemingly improbable quote from Queen Victoria: "No civilization is 
complete that does not make provision for the dumb and defenseless creatures of 
God's creation." 
</P>
<P>
Improbable for her maybe, but not for him. The one constant of Fugard's plays 
-- aside from their inextricable link with his native South Africa -- is his 
extraordinarily deep, even profound, human sympathy, which is not to be 
confused with sentimentality. It's a rigorous, closely observed, punishingly 
detailed identification with his characters and their situations that reaches 
so deep that it seems to collect like blood around a basic human root -- just 
the way South Africa itself appears compressed on the bottom of the world like 
the tapered base of an immense geographic tooth. 
</P>
<P>
What Harold Pinter said of Samuel Beckett could also be said of Fugard, who has 
rivaled Beckett as the English-speaking world's pre-eminent playwright: "He 
leaves no stone unturned and no maggot lonely." The similarity rests on 
Fugard's uncanny ability to get to the heart of a matter and find those 
sympathies that far transcend specifics -- he's a regional writer whose 
penetration of locale has helped make South Africa an international metaphor 
for sorrow and racial strife, for the personal human breath imperishably alive 
under a brutal political machine and modernism's leveling abstractions. He's 
won numerous awards, including two Tonys. It's not unlikely that at some point 
in his career he could win a Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
His latest play, "My Children! My Africa!," which has its West Coast premiere 
at the La Jolla Playhouse Aug. 26, deals with a black township schoolboy and a 
white schoolgirl who are brought together by a black teacher, Mr. M., to 
represent their school in regional debates. They begin by debating each other. 
The speech by the black student, Thami, says in part: 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition has spoken about sexual exploitation and the need for women's 
liberation. Brothers and sisters, these are foreign ideas. Do not listen to 
them. They come from a culture, the so-called Western Civilization, that has 
meant only misery to Africa and its people. It is the same culture that shipped 
away thousands of our ancestors as slaves, the same culture that has exploited 
Africa with the greed of a vulture during the period of colonialism, and the 
same culture which continues to exploit us in the 20th Century under the 
disguise of concern for our future." 
</P>
<P>
Counters Isabel, the schoolgirl: "I believe most strongly that there are values 
and principles in traditional African society which could be studied with great 
profit by . . . Western Civilization. But at the same time, I know, and you 
know, that Africa no longer lives in that past. For better or worse, it is part 
now of the 20th Century and all the nations on this continent are struggling 
very hard to come to terms with that reality. Arguments about sacred 
traditional values . . . are used by those who would like to hold back Africa's 
progress and keep it locked up in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Is this an obscure high school in the South African Karoo, or is it the streets 
of racially divided Bensonhurst, where black crowds yell at each other about 
who is more African than whom? 
</P>
<P>
"I always set out to show a brotherhood," Fugard said recently, as he was 
gearing up for rehearsals at the Playhouse. His associate director and longtime 
friend, Susan Hilferty, also works as a designer with the Playhouse and was 
instrumental in bringing the play there 
</P>
<P>
instead of to the Mark Taper Forum, where Fugard's plays normally have their 
local debuts. 
</P>
<P>
"With 'My Children! My Africa!,' it was time to acknowledge the extraordinary 
inspiration of young South Africans. 1984 was a period of great unrest in South 
Africa. It looked like that was the year when the country was going to blow 
apart. It's inexplicable how certain things touch you on the shoulder and say, 
'Remember me? We have an appointment.' The front pages of the newspapers were 
full of the horrors of the period. But it was this little item that stopped me. 
In a small hinterland Karoo town, a mob of blacks assaulted a teacher and 
necklaced him. That was all. Those were the facts." ("Necklacing" refers to 
murdering someone by igniting a gasoline-soaked tire around his neck.) 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, his thoughts were divided between the play and the daily 
political developments in South Africa, which he was monitoring closely. Where 
once he said, "I cannot see sanity prevailing in South Africa," now he was 
feeling cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"The whites know this old system has to go," Fugard said. "The unbanning of the 
African National Congress and the South African Communist Party, the freeing of 
political prisoners, the unbanning of all the people who'd been silenced under 
court order, and the release of Nelson Mandela -- at first I didn't believe it. 
For years the government had created an atmosphere of suspicion, but now I 
think it's imperative to give the government trust. . . . It's amazing to see 
how how rich Mandela is and how stunted is (president Frederik W.) de Klerk's 
capacity for soulful giving -- though it's clear he's struggling with the 
limitations of fear and prejudice that have been thrust on him. For you in the 
West to hear the phrase 'All men are created equal' is to draw a yawn. For us 
it's a miracle. We're starting out at rock bottom, man. But South Africa does 
have soul." 
</P>
<P>
His thoughts returned to "My Children! My Africa!" 
</P>
<P>
"The things that converge in the writing of a play come from a complex of 
motives, a genesis shrouded in a certain kind of mystery," Fugard said. "I 
meditated on that teacher, and then the young people of South Africa. I had to 
acknowledge them and how extraordinary it is that they're fighting for a sense 
of decency under a system that's been imposed on them. The teacher gave me an 
opportunity to lay out my testament of faith in what I did as a man of the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me the opportunity to articulate my faith in the power of the spoken 
and written word. There are times in my 30 years in the theater that I have 
come perilously close to losing faith in the one form of action I have in this 
life. There have been moments when I've said, 'Put away the pens and paper and 
go learn to make bombs.' But I feel if I ever broke the silken thread of faith, 
I would not have gotten it back." 
</P>
<P>
To spend any time with Fugard is to become reacquainted with the temper of his 
plays, which echo in his personality. He has the storyteller's innate skill at 
creating intimacy with a subject through mood and evocative detail, and a born 
actor's emotional transparency as well; his mirth gusts through him, his griefs 
tie up his whippet-thin frame, and he moves visibly through the writer's 
classic unending struggle to harness a thought, nail down a phrase. 
</P>
<P>
He has a face that belongs more to the 19th Century than to the 20th. Its lean 
angularity tapers into a forward-thrusting beard that gives him the 
commemorative look of an explorer, a sea captain or a weathered field-commander 
-- a stern, dure visage staring obdurately into endless vistas of the unknown 
tinged with unimaginable hostility. His intense, recessed eyes are a dark agate 
color and seem to blacken as he recalls pain or grief. He's a good, eager 
listener and an easy laugher ("Chaplin had a motto, 'If the flesh does not 
laugh in mockery and delight at the world around it, and itself, the flesh will 
die.' "). 
</P>
<P>
Part of his interview took place in one of the playhouse offices and part on a 
trail of the Torrey Pines Reserve, which snaked along the top of a bluff 
overlooking the Pacific ("It's called the Fleming Loop," he later told 
Hilferty. "Sounds like a gynecological device, doesn't it?"). During the '60s 
he had written in his notebook, "How thin and insecure is that little beach of 
white sand we call consciousness. I've always known that in my writing it is 
the dark troubled sea of which I know nothing, save its presence, that carried 
me. I've always felt that creating was a fearless and a timid, a despairing and 
hopeful, launching out into that unknown." 
</P>
<P>
He peered down below. In bright sunlight, the ocean off La Jolla had a bit more 
of a tropical, aquamarine glow than the darker, blue-black color it has further 
north, and the mid-size waves rolled ashore in frolicsome crests. "I had a 
place on the beach in Port Elizabeth that had a view like this," he said. "Then 
I moved a couple of miles inland." Why? "Every time a black friend visited my 
house, a neighbor informed the police." 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, the South African government seized his passport and in effect 
sentenced him to an internal exile that lasted for four years. (His phone was 
tapped, his mail was opened, and he was subjected to frequent interrogations.) 
Not that he would've chosen to leave anyway. He was in England with his wife 
when he heard of the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, in which 71 demonstrators 
among a group protesting South African pass laws were gunned down by police. 
His response was to return home at once. In a 1982 interview in the New Yorker, 
he explained his decision: "Like Tchaikovsky, I find that I cry very easily 
when I'm not on my native soil. I do very little crying back there. In Anna 
Akhmatova's awesome 'Requiem' she says, 'Under a foreign sky or on a strange 
land, I was with my people and they suffered.' That articulates it for me. It 
is an emotional bind to my country and its people that is without logic." He 
still lives in Port Elizabeth, but keeps a second home in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
("You can always tell when he's been away from home for too long," observed 
Hilferty. "He begins drying up. You feel a melancholy in him.") 
</P>
<P>
Today he was peering out over the Pacific, but he was thinking of home, and the 
events he was observing from afar. "My plane had just touched down in 
Johannesburg when I heard of De Klerk's decision to release Nelson Mandela," he 
said. "Like any other South African I said, 'What's the catch?' But it became 
clear that Mandela was right when he said De Klerk was a sincere man. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not talking concessions now; they're talking about restructuring the 
society. The first meeting between the African National Congress and the 
government has taken place. The rabid response of the white fascist 
neo-conservatives is a sign of the government's effectiveness -- they're 
bombing the country the way the ANC used to do. What people don't realize is 
that Mandela has problems of his own with the militant young blacks. They want 
victory and subjugation of the whites, not a negotiated settlement. And I worry 
about Mandela's total allegiance to the ANC, which won't make peace with the 
Inkatha movement -- which is made up of the Zulu majority. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, how does a man like Mandela exist? After 27 years behind bars, the 
first words he utters are of forgiveness for those who took those years from 
his life. 'Come, join us,' he says. 'Let us make the future together.' " 
</P>
<P>
The subject brought him back to "My Children! My Africa!" "The single most 
awesome tragedy, the greatest social disaster in the history of South Africa, 
is the lack of education afforded blacks. We're not just talking about reading 
and writing, we're talking about the ability to get into other viewpoints and 
understand attitudes other than your own. Education is not just the development 
of social tools. The real arena of the challenge is in the realm of the soul. 
Even the ANC is pulling in its head at the sight of a generation that can't 
read or write. They're saying, 'For God's sake, don't boycott the schools! Get 
your education.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fugard sees a similar danger in America, a country for which he feels great 
affection but which alarms him. "It's even more dangerous in this society, 
because somehow the angers and frustrations built around the social inequities 
that exist here are much more poisonous than in South Africa. I've stood on a 
street in New York near Penn Station and listened to a black political group 
that sets up a soap box and harangues passersby, and I've heard more poison, 
more anger and evil from them than anything I've heard in South Africa. The 
castrating forms of censorship are all around in America. Look at the NEA 
dispute. America is engaged in economic censorship, of censoring itself 
beforehand. It's obvious that television has corrupted literary craft for the 
theater. Now the attention span is eight minutes, then a blackout for 
commercial. It plays to the lowest common denominator of human intelligence. 
The structuring of human experience, the understanding of emotion, is 
completely falsified. It's very depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard later alluded to this mysterious groundswell of American rage when he 
spoke of casting "My Children! My Africa! in La Jolla. "The young people in my 
play deal with enormous anger and outrage," he said. "I wanted to be sure the 
actors I cast would understand that, so I asked all the actors who auditioned, 
young and old, about feeling anger. Some of the reponses -- particularly if you 
think all is well with your country -- would leave you frightened. You saw 
bitterness, frustration, anger of a most bitter degree, towards the business 
and society at large. I'm talking explosive responses." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke about the experience of Nancy Travis, who plays Isabel (Brock Peters 
plays Mr. M. and Sterling Macer plays Thami), and what she was up against as a 
woman. "I went to see the film she made, 'Internal Affairs.' She plays a 
married woman and there's a scene in a restaurant where her husband accuses her 
of having an affair with Richard Gere. She's innocent. The audience knows it, 
the husband doesn't. He slaps her around in public. The audience cheered. I 
couldn't believe it. It was horrible to sit in the middle of that savagery." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard was born Harold Athol Lannigan Fugard in Middleburg on June 11, 1932. 
His father was a jazz pianist who lost a leg in a childhood shipboard accident; 
lifelong complications forced an early retirement and a decline into alcoholism 
and inactivity. His mother was a matriarchal life force for the family (Fugard 
also has a brother and sister) and a good businesswoman. In 1941 she took over 
a Port Elizabeth cafe called the St. George's Park Tearoom, the setting of his 
"Master Harold . . . and the Boys." She doesn't appear in the play, but his 
shamed allusions to his father are echoed in his contention, "I have a 
deep-rooted sense of male ineffectuality." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never properly acknowledged my dad's influence on me," Fugard says now. 
"He was a great storyteller. One of my vivid memories is sitting at my father's 
bedside. The pain in what he called his 'gammy' leg was often unbearable. In 
return for my massaging it with the 1950s equivalent of Deep Heat called Oil of 
Wintergreen -- I can smell it now -- he told stories. We had a candle bedside 
so that we wouldn't disturb my mom. He loved Jack London, mystery thrillers, 
Bram Stoker, the Victorians. He'd put them in a nutshell and spin them out. I 
owe him the debt of my craft because I consider myself a storyteller." 
</P>
<P>
Of his mother, Fugard recalls, "A formidable lady. She paced me in my 
questioning, my examining and doubting the world in which I found myself. I'll 
never forget the way we did things together, the way she discovered her 
outrage, which didn't diminish but unfolded as she got older. She was a woman 
of righteous anger. Once when she was baking at the tea room, her bare arms 
covered with flour, she looked up and said, 'I shouldn't be making scones, I 
should be making bombs.' 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't just formidable, she was big, big! It's no accident that the most 
affirmative influences in my life have been women. I think it's true anywhere, 
black and white women sustaining their men. It's deep, extraordinary, 
mysterious. Is there a bigger word than mother? Where do we have an expression 
that's as primitive, as archetypal, as that: passing on life that links one 
with all life. She had awe, a primitive capacity for wonder that turned on like 
a tap. She was a rainbow. She drew no distinctions between reality and her 
dream life -- Jung would've embraced her. Towards the end of her life, the 
dreams became powerfully religious. She told me once of witnessing the 
Crucifixion and hearing Christ groan as he pulled the cross up the hill. She 
couldn't stand it and picked up the long end to help. She described what it 
sounded like to hear the nails driven into his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've inherited these qualities, you have a big debt of gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard took a scholarship at the Port Elizabeth Technical School to study auto 
mechanics (his mechanical skills have aided him enormously in the construction 
of his plays) and later took another scholarship at the University of Cape 
Town, where he studied philosophy and social anthropology, and spent his 
extracurricular time as an amateur boxer. In 1953, just before graduation, he 
decided to quit school. ("If I'd got that degree," he said in the New Yorker 
interview, "I could have been trapped into doing things I didn't want to do. I 
didn't want to teach. I just had a sense of horizons shrinking as I got nearer 
the end of university.") Instead, he hitchhiked the length of Africa with a 
friend and wound up broke in Port Sudan six months later, and from there signed 
on with a steamship bound for Japan. He was the only white man on board a ship 
full of Sudanese and Malaysians; it was his first experience in living with 
people of other races. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two years when I was a sailor were extraordinary," he said. "I realized 
just the other day how character-forming they were. Being a young white South 
African struggling with an accepted tradition of how to be with men of color, 
and how those traditions were wrong -- it was a muddle and a confusion. But in 
the end, how clarifying it was." 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Port Elizabeth, Fugard tried his hand at journalism, but found 
himself temperamentally unsuited to the dry conventions of reportage. He met 
and married another aspiring writer, Sheila Meiring. Both of them became 
interested in the theater (around this time, 1957, he wrote his first play, a 
short work called "The Cell," which premiered in a theater they founded in Cape 
Town). The Fugards relocated to Johannesburg, where Athol took a job as a clerk 
in a court that tried passbook cases. The job, which he described as "a 
nightmare," lasted only three months, but made a powerful impression on him 
when he saw how blacks brought in on charges of not carrying their government 
passes were completely deprived of due process (the experience later inspired 
one of his greatest successes, co-authored with John Kani and Winston Ntshona, 
"Sizwe Banzi Is Dead"). 
</P>
<P>
Fugard became a stage manager for South Africa's National Theatre Organization 
and began spending time in the black township of Sophiatown with black writers 
and others interested in starting a theater. He wrote "No-Good Friday" and 
"Klaas and the Devil," followed by "Nongogo," the story of an ex-prostitute who 
runs a saloon, and "A Place for the Pigs," which deals with a soldier who has 
been in hiding for 40 years. The works were performed for private audiences, 
but there wasn't much opportunity in South Africa at that time for playwrights 
with a new -- especially local -- voice. 
</P>
<P>
The Fugards moved to London to study theater; she worked as an office temp and 
he took up domestic housecleaning. (The Royal Court Theater not only wouldn't 
consider his plays, they wouldn't hire him as a stagehand either.) Fugard still 
views Great Britain with a certain misgiving, for political as well as personal 
reasons, though his plays are regularly performed there. ("My Children! My 
Africa!" opens at the National Theatre this fall, with his daughter, on whom he 
still dotes, calling her "my beautiful Lisa," appearing as Isabel.) 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, the British are rotten with class attitudes and prejudices," 
Fugard said. "It was they who first defined apartheid, but they don't 
acknowledge the significant hand they played in race relations in South 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Fugard's pregnancy with their daughter and news of the Sharpeville 
Massacre brought the Fugards back to South Africa. He wrote a novel called 
"Tsotsi," and then went to work on "The Blood Knot," in which he cast himself 
as the light-skinned Morris and Zakes Mokae as the darker-skinned Zach. He had 
been working with a young director named Barney Simon as well in a warehouse 
rehearsal space known as the Dorkay House. 
</P>
<P>
"Athol and I would stand at the window, watching the traffic come down the 
street," recalled Simon. "We'd wonder if any of the cars were going to stop at 
the theater." 
</P>
<P>
In a single October, 1961, performance before an steamy overcrowded house of 
friends, journalists and other theater professionals, the play ran uncut for 
four hours and revolutionized South African theater, much as John Osborne's 
"Look Back in Anger" had permanently altered the course of British theater -- 
South Africa had never seen a local interracial play like this before and had 
never heard the country's indigenous language expressed with such theatrical 
purity. 
</P>
<P>
"All my plays before that had been apprenticeship works," Fugard said. "I had 
set out to copy the masters, your Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Clifford 
Odets and Eugene O'Neill. Not the British. The Americans seemed to have that 
raw, gutsy, emotionally charged quality I wanted to write about in my people. 
With 'Blood Knot,' I finally discovered my own voice, the language, structure 
and style that were uniquely mine." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, a group of black men knocked on his door in Port Elizabeth. They were 
from a local township called New Brighton, and had heard of this fellow who had 
staged interracial plays. None of them had had any theater experience, but 
their collaboration with Fugard into a new troupe called the Serpent Theatre 
resulted in one of the most productive periods in Fugard's career (this was the 
period that produced "Sizwe Banzi Is Dead" and "The Island"). Other plays 
around this time, some with with the Serpent Theatre and some with his friend 
and associate, actress Yvonne Bryceland, included "The Cure" (1963), "People 
Are Living There" (1968), "Hello and Goodbye" (1969), "Friday's Bread on 
Monday"(1970), "Boesman and Lena" (1969), "Orestes"(1971) and "Dimetos"(1975). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the plays enjoyed a life outside South Africa and others didn't, but 
after "Sizwe Banzi" Fugard's work entered a more mature phase; everything he 
wrote met with international interest, including "Statements After an Arrest 
Under the Immorality Act" (1974), "A Lesson From Aloes" (1979), "Master Harold 
. . . and the Boys" (1982, his only play that did not premiere in South Africa) 
and "The Road to Mecca" (1984). 
</P>
<P>
"My Children! My Africa" opened at the Market Theater in Johannesburg in June 
of 1989 and had its American premiere at the New York Perry Street Theater in 
December. The La Jolla Playhouse production marks the West Coast debut of both 
the play and Fugard as director (he frequently acts in and directs his plays, 
and played Gen. Smuts in the film "Gandhi"). 
</P>
<P>
Fugard is a meticulous craftsman who writes the first draft of each play at 
home in Port Elizabeth with a different fountain pen and specially mixed ink. 
("To be a playwright is to be a maker of plays, like a wheelwright," he says. 
"You make a play like you make a table. You make it. It isn't just a matter of 
inspiration.") But inspiration does play its part. In addition to searching out 
what he calls his "fulcrum moments," those devices that quicken a play's hidden 
pulse, he usually puzzles one or more central, talismanic images. 
</P>
<P>
For "My Children! My Africa!," there's the image of a mountain pass. "I had Mr. 
M. holding a dictionary in one hand and a stone in the other to talk about how 
one had so much more power than the other -- the dictionary has 60,000 words, 
the stone just one -- but I didn't know where to go from there," Fugard said. 
"I knew I had to make Isabel go one step farther, but I didn't know what to do. 
I went for a run on one of the hottest days of the year in Port Elizabeth. 
After four miles, I suddenly -- it just came to me. I realized that Isabel had 
to pledge herself, to commit. I ran the next three miles crying tears of 
release -- I'd been so bottled up. There was a beat to the end -- Isabel at the 
mountain pass -- I didn't have to make up. It was already there. I sat down 
sweating and wrote it out." 
</P>
<P>
The allusion is to the boyhood of Mr. M., when en route to a rugby match, his 
class stops at the mountainous Wapadsberg Pass on the road to Cradock. The 
immense vista spread before him grips his heart. His asks his teacher what lies 
in that direction. North, is the answer, and if his little legs will carry him, 
he can wander the length of Africa and meet all his brothers. But if his little 
legs can't, he can meet them in books. So begins Mr. M.'s introduction to the 
power of the word. In the end, Isabel will seek out that pass. They are of 
different races, different generations, different sexes, and even a different 
consciousness, but standing on the same spot, they cannot help but share the 
same vision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been living in London and had seen the Bolshoi and Brecht and worked with 
Joan Littlewood," said Barney Simon, who in Johannesburg in 1976 co-founded the 
Market Theatre, which is now considered on a par with the Moscow Arts Theater, 
the Abbey and the Berliner Ensemble for the inspired concentration of its 
output. "Back in Johannesburg I saw one of Athol's early works, 'No-Good 
Friday,' and as amateurish as it was, it excited me as much as anything I'd 
seen. I felt an instant rapport and electricity with Athol. In his lyricism, he 
did for the South African language in the theater what Sean O'Casey did for the 
Irish. In a similar way he's a strong expression of the paradoxes and absurdity 
of existence -- all great theater is tragicomic. 
</P>
<P>
" 'My Children! My Africa!' is a very bold work for this time," Simon 
continued. "He argues that the word comes first, but I argue that his vision 
and impulse come first. His vision is extraordinary. And he's always had the 
courage to inform what he does with his own pain and damage. I'm not talking 
about personal confession. I mean really the true source, arrived at the 
hardest way, alone in front of a blank page." 
</P>
<P>
For a while before the conversation with Simon, the phone line to his 
Johannesburg apartment was down and it didn't look like an interview would be 
possible. A return to Fugard's notebooks seemed in order during the wait, and 
this passage seemed as characteristic as any: 
</P>
<P>
"People must be loved. That is the really crucifying experience in the short 
time we have as human beings -- that intimacy which breaks through our 
defensive isolation and shows the capacity -- if need be no more than that -- 
just the awareness of a potential -- of someone else's suffering."
