LEGISLATORS SEEK INQUIRY INTO GASOLINE PRICE INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Double-digit increases in the price of gasoline at Ventura County pumps angered 
consumers Tuesday and prompted a Republican congressman and a Democratic state 
senator to call for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have an oil shortage at this point; therefore, these price hikes . . 
. are unwarranted," said Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), who called for 
a federal investigation of possible antitrust and price-fixing violations by 
oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) made a similar appeal for a federal 
and state investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Hart and Lagomarsino said they do not think the oil supply crisis, prompted by 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday, is serious enough to warrant changing 
the federal government's ban on offshore oil development along the California 
coast. Without such a policy change, oil officials said, the crisis will not 
provide much of a boon for Ventura County oil producers. 
</P>
<P>
The county's gasoline retailers, however, have been busy raising prices. 
Self-serve, unleaded regular was selling for $1.29 a gallon at Chevron stations 
in Moorpark and Camarillo on Tuesday, an 8-cent increase since the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In the same period, prices have gone up 6 1/2 cents a gallon at an Exxon 
station in Ventura and 5 cents a gallon at a Mobil station in Thousand Oaks and 
at a Unocal station in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax that took 
effect last Wednesday, gasoline prices have risen more than 10% at some 
stations in less than a week. Several station operators said they expect more 
increases in the coming weeks, noting that the price of crude oil has reached 
the highest level in nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
"These scumbag oil companies remind me of looters after a disaster," said 
Donald Ricky, a contractor who was filling up at a Shell station in Ventura. 
The price of gasoline there went up 4 cents Sunday and 2 cents more Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same thing they did in '73 and '79," Ricky said, recalling previous 
oil crises. "They immediately leap at the first opportunity to gouge the 
consumer. I resent it like hell." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky said he has no choice but to pay the higher prices because he needs his 
truck for business. "I remodel houses," he said. "I can't ride the bus with a 
2-by-4." 
</P>
<P>
But a Shell spokesman in Houston said the higher prices are justified. 
</P>
<P>
"Oil is a commodity. It's no different from oranges, soybeans or coffee," 
spokesman H.F. Hutchins said. "This is the way world commodities operate. They 
react to what's going on with the supply situation on an immediate basis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not much different from what you see when there's an orange crop freeze 
in Florida or a coffee crop freeze in Costa Rica. Prices rise almost 
immediately in response to those events." 
</P>
<P>
Hutchins said a $3-per-barrel increase on July 27 by the oil-producing 
countries started the surge in prices. "The combination of that plus dramatic 
events in the Middle East have added a psychology of shortage and uncertainty 
in the market. The prices reflect that uncertainty in supply." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone buying gas on Tuesday was upset about the price increases. "I can 
see the oil companies' point of view," said Mike Murray of Ventura. "They feel 
there will be a shortage and they can make profits now. I'm not opposed to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But Lagomarsino, echoing charges by other congressmen, accused some oil 
companies of "taking advantage of the crisis in the gulf to make a huge profit 
off the public." He called for U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to investigate 
"possible antitrust and price-fixing violations." 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement Monday, the Justice, Energy and Transportation departments 
said they would monitor oil prices and vigorously prosecute any companies 
guilty of antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
After attending a meeting of the state Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday, Hart 
said the state and federal governments should "redouble our efforts at 
antitrust enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
"I think whenever you are in a situation like this there's an easy 
justification to raise prices." 
</P>
<P>
Hart said he disputed figures presented to the committee by Richard A. Bilas, a 
member of the California Energy Commission. Bilas told the panel that gasoline 
prices had gone up by only 2.4 cents on the average since the invasion. "That 
seemed awfully low, based on personal experience and what constituents say," 
Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, who has opposed offshore oil drilling, said that at this point he does 
not expect a change in the federal policy banning lease sales until 1996 along 
the Santa Barbara Channel and until the year 2000 along the rest of the state's 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends how much worse it gets," Hart said. "Those of us who oppose it off 
the Santa Barbara Channel would say there's much more to be gained from energy 
conservation. We just don't have a national energy policy." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino aide John Doherty said the congressman believes that all parts of 
the state should be treated equally. Lagomarsino has supported offshore 
drilling and was politically embarrassed in June when the Bush Administration 
banned it for the entire decade off most of the California coast but only until 
1996 in the waters off Lagomarsino's district. 
</P>
<P>
Oil company officials said that unless the crisis leads to more oil development 
off the Southern California coast, it would not provide much of a boost for the 
local oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a whole lot of change in Ventura County per se," said Fred 
Sarrafian, a Texaco official in Ventura. The company pumps about 9,000 barrels 
a day in the county, mostly from around the Ventura River bed. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be a substantial change if things result in more offshore oil 
activity," he said.

SHELTER SAYS OXNARD WANTS TO SHUT IT, OPEN OWN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN and SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the county's only year-round homeless shelter accused Oxnard 
officials Tuesday of conspiring to close the Zoe Christian Center while working 
to develop their own city-run shelter. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech to the City Council, Zoe founder Fred Judy said the 
city's effort to "manipulate and successfully cut off some major funding" for 
the center was based on racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"They have deliberately planned and generated negative support and attitude 
toward our organization," said Judy, who along with the Rev. Jim Gilmer, the 
center's executive director, is black. 
</P>
<P>
To support his assertions, Judy cited an internal memo from a Thousand Oaks 
city planner that said support of the center "may have political liability" 
with the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi called allegations of political maneuvering "absolutely 
false" and said the conflict with Zoe centers primarily on a zoning dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing all we can to help them out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the Zoe center, which provides shelter and counseling for about 
150 people a day, was placed in jeopardy when the city Fire Department issued a 
report in June, 1988, that pointed out that it is next to a fertilizer company 
where toxic chemicals are stored. The council has since said the center is too 
close to the hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Zoe Center had been operating for five years on a temporary permit in an area 
zoned for industrial and manufacturing uses. That permit expired last year. 
</P>
<P>
Judy contends that Oxnard's failure to renew the permit or rezone the area has 
prompted several organizations, including the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, to cut off funding to Zoe. He accused Takasugi and other 
officials of spreading inflammatory information about the center. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that Zoe has lost more than $1 million in grants since 1988. The 
center's annual budget is about $700,000, according to an Internal Revenue 
Service report. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Housing Director Sal Gonzalez said that the city has never tried to 
persuade any organization to cut off funding to Zoe and that it is trying to 
find a permanent site for the center. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gonzalez acknowledged that Oxnard officials asked the Assn. of Ventura 
County Cities in March to form a joint-powers agreement to help develop a 
homeless shelter in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said Judy and Gilmer will be allowed to bid to operate the proposed 
city-run Oxnard shelter. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ventura city officials told Judy that the city is withholding 
$200,000 in support to Zoe until Oxnard's joint-powers proposal is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it seems to me that somewhere along the line we are being eliminated 
from the picture," Judy told the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
During the Oxnard City Council meeting Tuesday, Judy revealed an internal memo 
from Thousand Oaks planning officials that he said proves Oxnard has tried to 
force the closure of the Zoe center. 
</P>
<P>
In the memo to Thousand Oaks City Manager Grant Brimhall, Senior Planner Olav 
Hassel said support of the joint powers agreement is "an alternative to 
additional assistance to Zoe." 
</P>
<P>
The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, says that "there appear to 
be two political groupings in the county pursuing the development of new 
shelter facilities" and that "commitment to the Zoe project may have political 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
The memo identifies the two groups as the city of Oxnard and Zoe supporters. 
</P>
<P>
However, in an interview Tuesday, Hassel tried to back away from statements in 
the memo. 
</P>
<P>
"My comments in that internal memo are an overreaction," he said. "It's obvious 
that my analysis oversimplified the situation. I don't think that funding the 
Zoe Center is a political issue. It's a zoning and environmental issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said the facts in the memo were correct but that the assumptions about 
political groupings were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Vice Mayor Donald Villeneuve, who also chairs an Assn. of Ventura 
County Cities subcommittee on homeless housing, said he was surprised by the 
statements in the Thousand Oaks memo. 
</P>
<P>
"What cropped up in the memo may be something the city of Oxnard is planning, 
but it was never discussed by the committee," he said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: COUNTY IS DOING ITS PART FOR LEGISLATIVE DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's often said that San Diego County doesn't count for much in the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A crass canard, that. A libel upon our dedicated public servants. 
</P>
<P>
Just look at the list of fancy cars leased by the state so legislators can 
cruise in style while pondering which health and education programs to slash in 
these lean times. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive car in the state Senate is the 1990 Lincoln Towne Car leased 
for Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita), valued at $30,811. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive car in the Assembly is the 1989 Cadillac Allante leased for 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), valued at $44,530. 
</P>
<P>
No local angle with Brown, you say. Oh ye of little faith. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's Cadillac, the sporty Mercedes-like model, is leased from De la Fuente 
Cadillac of El Cajon, owned by Brown's political friend Roque de la Fuente. 
When De la Fuente opened his business park in Otay Mesa, Brown was an honored 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
The state pays the maximum allowable under legislative rules: $446.50 a month 
for Deddeh's Lincoln, $400 for Brown's Caddie. Insurance is also provided. 
</P>
<P>
(Since the leases exceed the state maximum, Deddeh pays another $347.49 a month 
from his own pocket, and Brown pays $668.83.) 
</P>
<P>
Deddeh said the Lincoln is strictly for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I want something very heavy, because I drive a lot on the freeway," Deddeh 
told The Times' Ralph Frammolino. 
</P>
<P>
He said he drives 18,000 to 22,000 a miles a year, mostly around his district 
on weekends: "The only time it is non-business is when I go to church or go to 
the grocery, and, even then, someone stops me and asks about a piece of 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
About half of the legislators take the maximum car allowance. 
</P>
<P>
One who doesn't is Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside). It costs the state a 
crummy $200 a month to lease a 1985 Oldsmobile for Craven. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the roads in North County are less dangerous than those in South Bay.

NBA stars are coming to San Diego for a benefit game next Tuesday at the Sports

hospitality suite. 
</P>
<P>
Then somebody discovered that the luxury suite has a very low ceiling. That 
could be a problem for a bunch of giants. 
</P>
<P>
A new suite has now been found. The view isn't as good, but the ceiling is a 
regulation 10 feet.

During last year's City Council election, Linda Bernhardt sent out a mailer 
blasting Ed Struiksma for taking contributions from, among others in the 
building industry, executives of the La Jolla development firm Oliver/McMillan: 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past eight years, Ed Struiksma has sold our district to the highest 
bidders." 
</P>
<P>
Since her victory, Bernhardt has been hustling to reduce a $155,000 campaign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure forms filed last week show that Bernhardt received post-election 
contributions from, among others in the building industry, executives of 
Oliver/McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also hosted a Bernhardt fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The debt is now down to $90,000. And Bernhardt just sent a letter to previous 
contributors (and their spouses) asking for more money and pledging fealty: 
</P>
<P>
"Please make a contribution to the campaign deficit. Be assured that I will do 
everything in my power to continue to serve you in the best possible way."

RETRIAL SOUGHT OVER PROSECUTOR ON JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Municipal Court judge who allowed a prosecutor to serve on a 
jury that convicted an Oxnard man of heroin intoxication drew criticism Tuesday 
from the public defender's office and a motion by Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury's office for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Steven Hintz is scheduled to hear a motion today that William Lopez, 28, 
be retried. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez originally requested the new trial because he was unable to summon his 
own witnesses during a one-day trial before Hintz. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury's office said it joined the action to avoid a conflict of interest in 
a case where one deputy district attorney, Terence M. Kilbride, was a juror and 
another served as prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez acted as his own lawyer in the trial that ended Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The jury elected Kilbride as its foreman, then deliberated 15 minutes before 
finding Lopez guilty of being under the influence of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
Hintz sentenced Lopez to 330 days in jail, which Lopez admitted Tuesday was 
partly based on seven prior convictions on charges of narcotics intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward F. Brodie said Tuesday that the district attorney's 
office is joining Lopez's motion for a new trial to avoid the appearance of 
impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel anything was unjust about his conviction," said Brodie, the 
county's chief narcotics prosecutor. "But we fully intend to try the case 
again." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Ventura County public defender's office said Hintz neglected his 
duties by not citing the apparent conflict of interest caused by Kilbride's 
jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I have is I think that the judge has the general duty to see that 
justice is done," said Assistant Public Defender Duane Dammeyer. "And the judge 
should be as concerned with the appearance of impropriety as with actual 
impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
Hintz declined Tuesday to discuss the Lopez case since it is still under his 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent Baker, said he attempted 
during jury selection to avoid any conflict of interest by asking the court to 
excuse Kilbride. 
</P>
<P>
But when Lopez vehemently insisted on having Kilbride join the jury, Baker 
said, he withdrew his objections. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision, 'All right, if he thinks he's going to get a fair trial . 
. . he can proceed that way.' " And Baker said he worried that Kilbride might 
be more critical of the evidence than would an average juror. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said Tuesday in an interview at the Ventura County Jail that he 
originally thought Kilbride was a doctor, after misreading Kilbride's wife's 
occupation on a juror questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he did not learn until midway through the trial that he had put a 
prosecutor on his own jury. 
</P>
<P>
But even after he realized that Kilbride was a deputy district attorney, Lopez 
said, he did not worry that he would not get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a D.A.," Lopez said. "He should know how much the police officers are 
telling the truth and how much they're not." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he requested the new trial because he had been unable to contact a 
friend who was present when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also had been unable to reach an Oxnard police booking officer who 
heard him ask to be taken to a hospital for a urine test rather than being 
tested for heroin intoxication at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
Kilbride said, "I tried as best I could to be a fair and impartial juror." 
</P>
<P>
Kilbride said he did not mention that he was a prosecutor, and the other jurors 
did not ask. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was nominated as the jury foreman by three women jurors who said, 
"Let's make the guy in the suit the foreman." 
</P>
<P>
Kilbride said he recommended a straw poll in the opening moments of 
deliberations, before the jurors even began discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 11 to 1 for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But as the lunch break approached, the jurors discussed the case for a few more 
minutes, then voted unanimously for conviction, Kilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
Kilbride said he took part in the discussion. "But my observations were like 
the others: 'This is what I remember the testimony to be,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the evidence showed that Oxnard police detained Lopez near Cooper 
Road during a routine traffic stop for driving with expired license plates. 
Officer Richard Anderson testified that when Lopez got out of the car, he was 
shifting back and forth on the balls of his feet and that his pupils were 
constricted, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson took Lopez to Oxnard police headquarters, where he and other officers 
trained to recognize such symptoms observed that Lopez had clammy hands, warm 
upper arms and other signs of heroin intoxication, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
When Lopez refused to give a blood or urine sample, police arrested him, Baker 
said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL VOTES TO ENACT OPEN-MEETING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council, acknowledging the importance of public input, 
voted Tuesday to enact its own version of California's open-meeting law, which 
was recently suspended. 
</P>
<P>
After several minutes of congratulating themselves on their fair-mindedness, 
the council members voted 11 to 0 to draw up an ordinance resembling the Brown 
Act, which was suspended for a year by state budget writers as a cost-saving 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The act required local governments, including city councils and boards of 
supervisors, to post an agenda 72 hours before a meeting, follow that agenda 
and allow time for public comments.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN MURDERS OF 7 
PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he murdered seven people in a 
yearlong spree: three during a drug transaction, three in various bars and one 
in a motel parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Abelino Manriquez, 33, an unemployed laborer from East Compton appearing in 
Municipal Court for arraignment, denied seven counts of murder, three counts of 
residential robbery and one count of residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
He also pleaded not guilty to special circumstance allegations -- multiple 
murders and murder during an attempted robbery and a burglary -- which would 
qualify him for a possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Manriquez was ordered to remain in custody without bail and to return to court 
Sept. 10 for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Morrison said three of the slayings were premeditated 
by Manriquez and a second suspect and occurred during "a planned drug rip-off." 
Investigators are trying to identify the second suspect.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO; 
</P>
<P>
ANNEXATION OF 146 ACRES IS APPROVED

<P>
As part of a development plan known as Airport North, the Camarillo Planning 
Commission on Tuesday approved the annexation of 146.68 acres between Camarillo 
Airport and the Ventura Freeway west of Las Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
Seacoast Associates, which plans to develop the area, requested that the city 
annex a 75.5-acre parcel and change the zoning to allow a combination of 
professional and industrial offices and general commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
Another 71.18 acres are to be included in the annexation at the request of the 
property owners. All the property under consideration for annexation is now 
farmed with row crops. 
</P>
<P>
To provide for a greenbelt between Camarillo and Oxnard, an agricultural parcel 
of nearly 50 acres south of the airport will be detached from city jurisdiction 
under the Planning Commission's action. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners also approved a request by Mission Gelles of Santa 
Barbara for the rezoning of 51.42 acres just east of the Seacoast property. The 
developer has requested zoning similar to that suggested by Seacoast for the 
eventual construction of office buildings and general industrial complexes. 
</P>
<P>
All the annexation and zoning changes are subject to approval by the City 
Council and the Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the Planning Commission approved a 600-square-foot addition to 
the existing 5400-square-foot First Interstate Bank in Carmen Plaza at Paseo 
Camarillo and Carmen Drive. Plans include the addition of another automated 
teller machine. RUSS CHARVONIA

MENTAL HEALTH OFFICIALS AWAIT BAD NEWS ON FUND CUTS THAT COULD SLASH SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County's mental health system could be derailed if budget cutbacks 
proposed in the new state budget are enacted later this month, local officials 
warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The county's mental health programs face the possibility of losing up to $7 
million in state funds, said Steve Harmon, assistant deputy mental health 
director. If enacted by state bureaucrats, the $7-million cut would affect the 
county's mental health services and programs for the poor, totaling about 
47,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"For all practical services, services for the medically indigent could be 
serverly cut and eliminated," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
John Sweeten, director of intergovernmental affairs for the county, said 
funding for the county's mental health programs is already below "the level 
needed to maintain an adequate system of mental health care." 
</P>
<P>
However, both Sweeten and Harmon said the amount of the cuts San Diego County 
will have to endure will not be known until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The two said the options range from an unrealistic expectation of zero cuts to 
a worst-case scenario of a $7-million reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the depth of the cuts," Sweeten said. "Over the next few weeks 
the county managers in mental health and health departments will be seeking 
better information about the depth of the cuts." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian left it up to the state Department of Health to decide 
how much to reduce from each county's mental health budget, Harmon said. Harmon 
and other mental health officials expressed optimism Tuesday that San Diego 
County's cutback will not be as severe as in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
One option under consideration by the state is bigger cuts for counties that 
have traditionally received a greater portion of state funding for mental 
health services. If the state uses this formula, San Diego County would come 
out relatively unscathed, said local officials. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said the county now ranks last of 58 California counties in state funds 
received for mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If they use the reverse allocation formula, San Diego wouldn't suffer a 
serious cut. But don't forget that we're already under-funded to begin with," 
Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sweeten warned that, whatever the outcome, the Board of Supervisors will 
have to make some tough decisions on Sept. 11, when they decide how to allocate 
the remaining mental health funds. 
</P>
<P>
"The board will not have a strategy on how to implement the reductions until 
they debate the various scenarios. . . . If the $7-million cut is enacted, the 
county will have to eliminate a variety of activities in the mental health 
system critical for its operation," Sweeten said. 
</P>
<P>
"The result would be that the remainder of the program would be unable to 
accomplish its basic function when you take away a number of little pieces . . 
. . What is left would not be capable of doing what there is to do."

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<P>
No one wants to get caught at an epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
But what about at the Epicentre, L.A.'s first earthquake-themed restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling was that so many people from out of state talk about L.A. falling 
into the ocean that we'd have a positive attitude about it," said A. L. 
Wehmeyer, assistant general manager of the downtown Kawada Hotel. "Besides, 
Californians have a good sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
The Kawada's Epicentre, located at the corner of Hill and 2nd streets, will 
open to epicures in October, three years after the Whittier quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
Wehmeyer said that the restaurant's decor will include walls designed to appear 
as if they're cracked, a map that shows California taking a dive into the 
Pacific and a work of art that depicts City Hall "as it is now and after it has 
crumbled in an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the dessert menu will include pineapple upside-down cake. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the shifting Earth, have you ever noticed the world map sculpture 
on the Pacific Bell building on Grand Avenue? 
</P>
<P>
California's still in place, but South America has moved up alongside it. 
Meanwhile, Africa has drifted up toward Canada. And Australia's where Brazil 
used to be. 
</P>
<P>
Keep Pac Bell's map in mind the next time you have trouble making a connection 
on an international phone call. 
</P>
<P>
This is about that sports team that shifted its base to L.A. and left many 
embittered fans behind. We mean the Dodgers, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The club's heavy hitters -- its lawyers -- have filed a lawsuit against two men 
who are using the name "Brooklyn Dodgers" on two restaurants in Brooklyn. The 
team claims it has sole rights to "Brooklyn Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden has asked New York to seek a 
court order declaring the name part of the public domain, meaning anyone could 
use it. 
</P>
<P>
First employed in 1890, the term originally described the baseball fans who had 
to dodge trolley cars to get to the park. 
</P>
<P>
"The name 'Brooklyn Dodgers' cannot be owned by a Los Angeles corporation which 
turned its back on us more than 30 years ago," Golden declared. 
</P>
<P>
As a public service to the two cities involved, Only in L.A. has decided to 
combine two of its recent crusades: How Can Irwindale Fill Up Its Pits? and 
What Can Long Beach Do With the Spruce Goose?

from the Olympics.

LEGISLATOR SAYS LETTER CASTS DOUBTS ON PARK SERVICE'S ROLE IN HOPE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of a congressional subcommittee that oversees the National Park 
Service says that a 1988 letter concerning Cheeseboro Canyon in Ventura County 
raises new questions about the National Park Service's authority to approve a 
controversial swap of federal land without legislation by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the Park Service could proceed with a proposed exchange of 
59 acres of federally owned land in Cheeseboro Canyon for about 1,100 acres 
that entertainer Bob Hope owns on the adjacent Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the deal have sought to shift the decision-making process from the 
agency to Congress, where they maintain it would probably receive a more 
critical review. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service has not taken a formal position on the exchange pending 
completion of its environmental impact review, but top agency officials have 
expressed support for the proposal in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option to buy the 2,308-acre Jordan 
Ranch from Hope, is seeking to build 750 estate houses and a tournament golf 
course on the ranch's remaining 1,208 acres. 
</P>
<P>
They need the 59 acres of Cheeseboro for an access road to the development from 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Hope has agreed to sell another 4,600 acres of mountain property to public 
agencies at a below-market $10 million if the exchange is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the Interior Committee's 
subcommittee on national parks and public lands, asked Park Service Director 
James M. Ridenour recently whether the agency has authority to trade away part 
of Cheeseboro Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Vento said that, under a literal reading of the law, the Park 
Service does "not appear to have authority." 
</P>
<P>
Vento has asked Ridenour to obtain a legal opinion on this question from the 
Interior Department's solicitor. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) made the same request when his government operations 
subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources held an oversight 
hearing on the proposed swap last month. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law permits the Interior secretary to approve land swaps within a state 
if the properties are deemed of equal value or a cash payment is made to the 
government to equalize the values. 
</P>
<P>
But the law forbids such an administrative exchange when it would change the 
boundaries of a national park, which requires congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeseboro Canyon and Jordan Ranch are within the contours of the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area, a 150,000-acre patchwork of houses, other 
private holdings and public land. 
</P>
<P>
Vento's query was prompted by a Feb. 10, 1988, letter from then-Interior 
Secretary Donald P. Hodel to key members of Congress advising them that he was 
making a minor boundary change to the park to incorporate two parcels at the 
southern end of Cheeseboro Canyon next to Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary has the authority to take such an action but is required to 
inform the chairmen of the House and Senate committees that oversee the 
Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
About half of one of the parcels -- 30 acres that was purchased by the Park 
Service in 1985 -- is part of the 59 acres in the proposed swap. 
</P>
<P>
A second 20-acre parcel, which was donated to the Park Service, is not. 
</P>
<P>
Donald J. Hellmann, associate counsel for the Wilderness Society, a leading 
opponent of the swap, said a boundary revision that was required to add the 
30-acre parcel to the park proves that a boundary change would also be needed 
to remove it from federal ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"With this evidence, I don't see any question whatsoever that this type of 
exchange requires legislation," Hellmann said. 
</P>
<P>
But Willis P. Kriz, chief of the Park Service's land resources division, said 
Hodel's letter does not have any bearing on the question of a boundary change 
in the exchange. "The two actions are separate and independent of each other," 
Kriz said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Kirsch, an attorney representing Potomac, also said that Hodel's letter, 
which he noted has long been in the public domain, does not buttress Hellmann's 
claim that legislation is needed for the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other national parks that consist of only federally owned land, Kirsch 
said, most of the sprawling Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area is made up 
of houses, businesses and other pieces of privately owned property. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, although a boundary change was legally required to incorporate part 
of Cheeseboro Canyon, transferring the 59 acres to a private party does not 
remove it from the recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
"This boundary issue just keeps coming up as a red herring," Kirsch said.

COMPANY TO STAGE DISASTER DRILL

<P>
Officials of a Simi Valley propane plant said they plan to stage a mock 
disaster this morning in an effort to promote emergency preparedness in the 
event of a real disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley police, Ventura County firefighters and personnel from Pruner 
Ambulance Service and Simi Valley Adventist Hospital will participate in the 
drill, said Tom Ewing, district manager for Suburban Propane, which is 
sponsoring the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The drill, which will involve a simulated bomb blast, is scheduled to begin at 
10 a.m. at Tapo Street and Los Angeles Avenue, where the company is located, 
Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise will include simulated injuries as well as a hazardous chemical 
leak, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Adams, Simi Valley emergency services coordinator, said drills give 
different emergency groups a chance to interact with one another in a 
non-threatening situation. He said the exercise also helps raise public 
awareness about safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, who said his company has never had a major accident, said this is the 
third drill in the last three years that Suburban Propane has sponsored. An 
earthquake drill was held last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to feel our facility is incident-proof, but still there could be an 
8.0 earthquake," he said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WAGE WAR ON PLASTIC FOAM PACKAGING; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE: THE EFFORT COMES AS A NORTH COUNTY ORGANIZATION FACES WHAT COULD BE THE 
END OF ITS CURBSIDE RECYCLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two environmental groups are stepping up the war against plastic foam packaging 
by organizing a citizens' campaign to replace polystyrene products with 
biodegradable paper alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Recyclers and the North County Coastal Greens will hold a public meeting 
at 7 p.m. today at Solana Beach Presbyterian Church to launch a campaign in Del 
Mar, Encinitas and Solana Beach to educate businesses about the health and 
environmental hazards of polystyrene and other plastic foam packaging. 
</P>
<P>
In a related environmental issue, curbside recycling collection in North County 
appears in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The Encinitas Community Advisory Board voted 4 to 1 Monday to deny Solana 
Recyclers' request for a permit to continue operating at its present site and 
to expand its plant capacity nearly fourfold. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Recyclers, the area's only curbside recycling collector, charges 55 
cents a month to 27,000 housing units, or 60% of all households in Solana 
Beach, Encinitas and Del Mar, said Brooke Nash, executive director of Solana 
Recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
the Encinitas City Council in 1987 assisted the company in arranging to lease a 
quarter acre owned by the county at 135 N. El Camino Real, Nash said. The 
site's zoning allows a mixture of commercial, residential and public works 
facilities. The county staff already approved the company's expansion. Three 
residents opposed the permit request. 
</P>
<P>
"This vote was unexpected," Nash said. "We were shocked. If it is upheld, we'll 
have to shut down. There won't be any curbside collection in the area." 
</P>
<P>
The Community Advisory Board's recommendation goes before the city's Planning 
Commission in September. On appeal, the City Council has final say. The 
recycling company will appeal the recommendation, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-polystyrene campaign will continue. Its goal is to persuade 
restaurants, markets, vendors, delicatessens and other takeout food 
establishments to use paper packaging products instead of polystyrene food 
packaging and containers for items such as egg cartons, meat trays, coffee cups 
and fast food. 
</P>
<P>
Polystyrene foam packaging is chemically synthesized from petroleum, producing 
hazardous waste byproducts. The North County Coastal Greens is a chapter of a 
national anti-nuclear, ecology movement. Solana Recyclers is a nonprofit 
organization founded in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the campaign will be Solana Recyclers' block leaders, who have helped 
persuade 60% of residents in Del Mar, Encinitas and Solana Beach to participate 
in the group's curbside recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants and other users of plastic foam packages have been reluctant to 
switch to paper products because of expected cost increases, but substituting 
paper products would not substantially raise expenses, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash cited the increasing number of fast-food restaurant chains that are 
switching to paper-product containers as evidence that the changeover is 
economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"It would cost only a few pennies more (per customer purchase)," Nash said. "I 
think if you ask people whether they would spend an extra nickel, they would 
say yes." 
</P>
<P>
Cris Weatherby, a recycling block leader, said many restaurant owners 
mistakenly believe some plastic foam packaging products are environmentally 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I've encountered only resistance to switching, so I think the main goal is 
educate them and show them there are alternatives," Weatherby said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers plan to solicit contributions and services from businesses to print 
informational brochures and lists of alternative paper-packaging products. The 
brochures will be given to restaurants, bars, markets and other food and 
beverage merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers will be encouraged to ask merchants to switch to paper products or 
lose their patronage. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said this would not be a direct boycott of businesses that refused to stop 
using polystyrene, but she said boycotts are a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
She called the campaign a "positive appeal to make the right environmental 
choice" and said businesses that cooperate will receive some sort of 
certificate or window decal to display. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign will rely on environmentally conscious residents selling their 
neighbors and local restaurants and markets on using paper products, which are 
biodegradable and renewable, said Patricia Grimes, community outreach 
coordinator for Solana Recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get away from the throwaway mentality, that there is an endless 
supply of resources," Grimes said. "It's hard to do, but we need to get people 
to change their habits." 
</P>
<P>
Nash said the campaign plans to take advantage of what she described as the 
public's growing concern about the ecology. She cited UC San Diego's decision 
last year to ban polystyrene and other forms of plastic packaging on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I think public interest is up, and that businesses are hearing consumers' 
concerns about the environment," Nash said. "Consumers have unlimited power 
with their buying practices, and they can band together to influence businesses 
and the manufacturers of plastic products." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the campaign will be modeled on similar ventures that have 
succeeded in Berkeley and other communities.

BAIL FOR SUSPECTS IN SLAYING WAS AN ERROR, D.A. SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE COMMENTS FOLLOW PROTESTS THAT THE $20,000 BOND FOR 2 WHITE 
TEEN-AGERS IN THE DEATH OF A BLACK MINISTER WAS RACIST.

<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office conceded Tuesday that 
prosecutors erred last week when they recommended only $20,000 bail for two 
white youths charged in the shooting death of a black minister but denied that 
the decision was racist. 
</P>
<P>
"There should have been no bail," said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the 
district attorney. "Our bail schedule calls for no bail in a murder case. 
Therefore, we feel that the recommendation of the $20,000 initial bail was 
unjustified. However, it has been rectified." 
</P>
<P>
The review of the decision to allow low bail was prompted by protests by 
ministers and community activists in the northeast San Fernando Valley who 
reacted angrily after learning that the suspects in the July 28 slaying of Carl 
White, pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church, were initially granted $20,000 
bail. They called the low bail "lethal racism." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that White was shot in the back of the head during a dispute 
with Philip J. Dimenno, 19, and Dana L. Singer, 18, both of Northridge. The 
suspects allegedly went to White's house in Chatsworth to discuss a minor 
traffic accident that had occurred the night before. They were arrested three 
days after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Billy D. Webb, head of the San Fernando office, said he made 
the decision to initially seek the unusually low bail for the two college 
students because they lived with their parents, had strong ties to the 
community and did not appear to be a danger to the public if released. A 
background search by police had turned up no prior record for either of the 
suspects at the time. 
</P>
<P>
However, a day after bail was set at $20,000, police discovered both had been 
cited earlier this year when they were caught trespassing at a city park while 
armed. Police also learned the gun used to kill White was stolen, and Singer 
had stolen credit cards in his possession. The bail was vacated at prosecutors' 
request and Dimenno, who had already been released on bail, was rearrested. 
Both suspects are being held without bail pending their arraignment next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Webb's decision was reviewed Monday night by Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard W. 
Hecht, chief of branch and area operations for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the recommendation that bail should be set in the amount of 
$20,000 was a mistake and I told Mr. Webb that," Hecht said. "It was a 
discretionary call by him. I understand his reasons. But, in terms of the 
amount of bail, that was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Hecht said he found no indication that Webb was racially motivated. He 
described Webb as an American Indian who is sensitive to minority issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret the issue of race was raised here," Hecht said. "I don't find that to 
be true. Mr. Webb was not aware of the race of the victim until after the bail 
recommendation had been made. No one asked the question during the discussion 
because it was irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
No disciplinary action will be taken against Webb, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the prosecutors' office did little to mollify those who had 
called for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so easy to say they made a mistake," said Bishop Milford Harvey of the 
Unity Life Christian Center in Lake View Terrace. "But they are professionals 
and I believe it was a decision that was intentionally made because of the 
racial situation."

COMMUNITY COLLEGES PUT IN TIGHTER BUDGET BIND; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PIERCE AND VALLEY COLLEGE ADMINISTRATORS ARE TOLD TO CUT $1 MILLION 
EACH, AND MISSION IS TOLD TO PARE $300,000. SOME CLASSES WILL BE CANCELED. 
</P>

<P>
Students and staff at three San Fernando Valley community colleges are facing 
leaner times as administrators pare back operations to match skimpier than 
expected state budget allocations. 
</P>
<P>
In letters that were to be sent out to the colleges Tuesday, officials with 
Pierce and Valley colleges were told to cut about $1 million each, while the 
smaller but rapidly growing Mission College stands to lose more than $300,000. 
Even before the new cutbacks, the district's 1990-91 budget was lower than the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions hit the Los Angeles Community College District particularly 
hard, because they come on the heels of $1 million taken back from the 
district's nine colleges in the spring. Those adjustments occurred when the 
district discovered that its spending for the 1989-90 fiscal year exceeded the 
amount budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the district will receive $363 million from the state for 1990-91, 
about $8 million less than expected, said Lila Aurich, acting budget director. 
The district overestimated the amount it would receive from state lottery 
revenues and an annual cost-of-living increase, Aurich said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'll have to spend has gone up while our income has gone down," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
College administrators across the Valley still are determining exactly where 
the latest round of cuts will come, but all said there would be fewer classes 
offered in the fall. Canceling classes is self-destructive for state-supported 
colleges, they acknowledged, because state funding is based on enrollment in 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Valley and Pierce colleges said that although no full-time 
faculty members will be laid off, instructors probably will be asked to teach 
some of the more popular night and weekend classes. Those classes usually are 
taught by part-timers. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy meeting of department heads Tuesday, Pierce College 
administrators decided to cut classes with the lowest attendance and to lay off 
some part-time instructors at the Woodland Hills campus, said college President 
Dan Means. Hardest hit will be the departments of agriculture, electronics, 
nursing and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
Means said that the college recently canceled programs in dairying and 
forensics to help prevent a deficit in the 1989-90 budget. He said he was 
surprised to learn last week that further reductions will be required. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a shocker," he said. "It would be nice if you could have a budget and 
just rely on it and live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Valley College President Mary Lee had a similar reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We are already tight" in areas such as maintenance, supplies and staffing at 
the Van Nuys campus, Lee said. "It's kind of rough." 
</P>
<P>
At Mission College in San Fernando, administrators seemed to be approaching 
despair. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to figure it out now . . . but we don't have anywhere to pare it 
away," said Andy Mazor, vice president for academic affairs. "I don't have 
enough money to make the year even without the cut." 
</P>
<P>
Mission College -- at 6,000 students the smallest of the Valley colleges -- is 
building a permanent campus in Sylmar to replace the storefronts and bungalows 
it has used for years. Mazor said the new campus is already too small to serve 
the current number of students and if budget cuts cause enrollment declines it 
will be difficult to convince the state that further expansion is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It would put us in a down spiral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Legislature passed the final budget at the end of July, the district 
learned the cost-of-living increase for community colleges was only 4.7%. Based 
on recent history and preliminary statewide estimates, the district had counted 
on a 5.2% cost-of-living increase. 
</P>
<P>
The district had also hoped to receive about $10.5 million from the state 
lottery, but instead the district is to get $9.4 million. An increase of $2.5 
million in employee benefits costs also was unanticipated.

SIMI VALLEY DROPS FIGHT OVER PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
PORTER RANCH: CITY COUNCIL HAS DECIDED AGAINST A LAWSUIT. IT SAYS L.A. AND THE 
DEVELOPER HAVE EASED THEIR CONCERNS OVER SMOG AND TRAFFIC. 
</P>

<P>
The Simi Valley City Council decided Tuesday night not to file a lawsuit 
against the city of Los Angeles to block the $2-billion Porter Ranch 
development in Chatsworth because they said their concerns about increased 
traffic and smog have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which had faced a Friday deadline for filing a lawsuit, announced 
its decision not to take legal action after meeting in closed session for 
nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Davis said the council had been assured by the city of Los 
Angeles and Porter Ranch Development Co. that a fourth lane on the Simi Valley 
Freeway would be built before occupancy permits are issued for 4.5 million 
square feet of commercial and retail space. Construction permits also would not 
be issued for the same amount of commercial and retail space until the fourth 
freeway lane is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Greg Stratton said the language guaranteeing these provisions would be 
included in Los Angeles' district plan, which supersedes the Porter Ranch 
development's specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which voted July 23 to pursue a lawsuit against Los Angeles to 
block the development project, had charged that the environmental impact report 
on the Porter Ranch development did not adequately answer questions about how 
and when Los Angeles and the developer would compensate for added traffic 
congestion and smog that would be generated by the project. 
</P>
<P>
The development, which would rank with Century City as one of the largest in 
Los Angeles history, will include 3,395 residences and 6 million square feet of 
commercial and retail office space. It would be built in the Chatsworth Hills 
just north of the Simi Valley Freeway and less than five miles east of Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
According to the environmental impact report approved by the Los Angeles City 
Council, the Porter Ranch development will generate an additional 150,602 car 
trips per day in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the Porter Ranch area, 
had blasted the council's decision to sue Los Angeles, saying that Simi Valley 
officials acted rashly in their decision and suggested that they may be opening 
themselves up to a countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton said that during the past two weeks, he and Assistant City Manager 
Mike Sedell had met with Bernson and representatives of the Porter Ranch 
Development Co. to see if they could reach some sort of agreement to avoid a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it worked out very well," Stratton said of the negotiations. "We 
really wanted to see the freeway widened as quickly as possible. Now we can 
move forward together. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Davis agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still concerned with the size of the project," Davis said. "But I felt we 
probably got as much as we would have if we had proceeded with a lawsuit. We 
did what we had to do. We held up a hammer and said, 'Hey, negotiate guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
Davis said a lawsuit would have cost the city a tremendous amount of money and 
time and "created a war between Los Angeles and Simi Valley that nobody 
wanted." The council had come under attack from some residents worried that a 
lawsuit would cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mayor did a great job and Mr. Bernson did," Davis said. "It shows that 
cooler heads can sit down and work things out. It's a win, win for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Don Worsham, a member of PRIDE, a San Fernando Valley neighborhood group 
opposed to the Porter Ranch project, said his group had scheduled a news 
conference in front of Los Angeles City Hall at 2 p.m. today to announce 
whether it will file a lawsuit against the city to block the Porter Ranch 
development.

RULING LETS BEILENSON'S OPPONENT CAMPAIGN AT TOWN HALL MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge settled a squabble between U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Los Angeles) and his Republican opponent Tuesday, ruling that the opponent 
can hand out campaign literature outside the congressman's local "town hall" 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But a Beilenson spokesman charged that GOP candidate Jim Salomon, who lost 
badly to Beilenson in 1988, sought the judge's order only as a publicity stunt 
to "attract attention to a faltering campaign." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman issued a temporary restraining order 
forbidding Beilenson to prevent Salomon from handing out campaign literature at 
town hall meetings the congressman holds with constituents, usually at local 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the judge's decision Tuesday, Salomon and two campaign workers 
appeared outside another Beilenson meeting at a Woodland Hills school, passing 
out brochures and chatting with residents. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon asked Ideman for the order after a Los Angeles school police officer, 
alerted by Beilenson's staff, ordered three Salomon campaign workers away from 
a Canoga Park school where Beilenson was talking with local voters Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon, a Beverly hills trade consultant, said school grounds are public 
property and Beilenson's action violated his free speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Miller, a Beilenson assistant, said he called school police Saturday 
after Salomon workers set up an information table and placed campaign posters 
on the walls at Welby Way Elementary School in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he did so only because he was worried that school officials might 
refuse to give Beilenson permits for future meetings if they thought campaign 
activity was taking place there. Miller said a school police official confirmed 
that campaigning was not allowed on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Beilenson did not even send a lawyer to contest Salomon's request 
at the court hearing and that the judge's order helps Beilenson by ensuring 
that Salomon's campaigning will not jeopardize the congressman's ability to 
hold the town hall get-togethers at schools. 
</P>
<P>
The two camps also clashed Tuesday over what took place at another town hall 
parley last month in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
According to Salomon spokesman Richard Mahan, a wary Beilenson tried to 
persuade a local TV news crew to leave the meeting, but crew members refused. 
When the cameraman later left the room briefly, a Beilenson staffer removed the 
TV crew's microphone from the speaker's podium, Mahan charged. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller said Beilenson merely asked constituents if they minded the TV crew 
being present. He said he had no knowledge of anyone from Beilenson's staff 
moving the crew's microphone.

COUNCIL BALKS AT ADOPTING MIRAMAR LAKE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt and developer Corky McMillin unveiled a 
proposal Tuesday that both described as a workable solution to a longstanding 
disagreement over how to develop the north shore of Miramar Lake. 
</P>
<P>
However, during a lengthy closed session, council members declined to accept 
the agreement, at least at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no authorization for a settlement," Mayor Maureen O'Connor said after 
the closed hearing. "There was not five votes for a settlement." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts described the proposed settlement agreement, which was 
submitted to the council shortly before noon, "as one of the more complex, the 
most complex we have ever had here . . . there is a great deal at stake for the 
city of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed during Tuesday's secret session to take public testimony on 
the proposed settlement at a Sept. 18 hearing. The accord, if accepted by 
council, evidently would end a federal lawsuit that McMillin brought against 
the city two months ago in order to overturn an emergency ordinance that 
restricted development at the lake's northern shore. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt said at at press conference that the proposed settlement agreement 
would protect the environmental concerns of area residents, help to build 
desperately needed public facilities such as roads and schools and allow 
McMillin and his partners to build a profitable development. 
</P>
<P>
McMillin, president of McMillin Development, described the plan as a "balanced 
financial plan that gives us the ability" to make a profit as well as pay for 
needed public facilities. McMillin also described the plan as "much, much more 
desirable" from an environmental perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Although specifics of the proposed settlement were not released, it would 
eliminate a controversial industrial park planned for the northwest corner of 
the lake. Total open space would be increased to 268 acres, up from 168 acres, 
and only about 60 homes would be visible from the lake shore, down from the 700 
that would have been visible from the shore if a past development plan had been 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
The plan drew praise from Gary Underwood, founder of the Save the Lake 
Committee, a public-interest group that formed nearly two years ago to oppose 
McMillin's initial development plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I support the compromise development agreement," Underwood said. "It will help 
to provide adequate facilities for the community and a fair and reasonable 
profit" for McMillin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Sorensen, president of the Scripps Ranch Assn., said he was "greatly 
encouraged" by the proposed agreement. He said it would help Scripps Ranch 
develop urgently needed "roads, schools and other facilities." 
</P>
<P>
McMillin urged the council to act swiftly on the settlement agreement. "I could 
receive information that financing on this project (has been canceled)," 
McMillin told the council. "You could have on your hands the destiny that this 
project might not go forward." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a project I can make work today," McMillin said. "I don't know if I 
can make it work 30 days from now."

CAMARENA AFTERMATH: PYRRHIC VICTORY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was doubtless a deeply satisfying victory for the U.S. Justice Department. 
The complex and controversial trial that grew out of the brutal murder of U.S. 
drug agent Enrique Camarena five years ago ended in the conviction of four 
foreign drug traffickers. But it could prove a verdict most Pyrrhic -- one that 
could needlessly hurt relations with Mexico if it is not handled with great 
tact. 
</P>
<P>
Of special concern is the conviction of Ruben Zuno Arce, a wealthy Mexican 
businessman who helped the drug traffickers who kidnaped Camarena, a Drug 
Enforcement Administration agent based in Guadalajara, and tortured him to 
death. Unlike several other suspects who have been convicted in U.S. and 
Mexican courts in the Camarena case, Zuno Arce is not just another thug. He is 
related to the family of former Mexican President Luis Echeverria Alvarez and 
very much a member of Mexico's political Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. drug agents have long suspected that major narcotics traffickers could not 
operate in Mexico without at least the passive cooperation of influential 
Mexicans, but Zuno Arce's conviction marks one of the few times this widely 
shared suspicion has been proved in court. And because Camarena's murder was 
the most egregious example of how this corrupt alliance can work, it took on a 
symbolism far beyond the normal drugs-and-murder investigation; it was 
routinely discussed at the presidential level in both Mexico City and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
And the manner in which Camarena was methodically interrogated and tortured to 
death led other drug agents to pursue the case with near-religious zeal. On 
more than one occasion, they pressed the law to the limit to track down 
suspects and bring them before U.S. courts. Indeed Zuno Arce may yet go free if 
an appeals court rules that federal agents went too far in trying to get him 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Bush Administration officials must not let their satisfaction over 
this moral, as well as legal, victory blind them to the many other important 
issues on the U.S.-Mexican agenda -- not least of which is the need for greater 
cooperation in the continuing war against drug traffickers. Current Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has done more than any of his predecessors 
to help stem the flow of drugs through Mexico from Colombia and other producing 
countries. He has also begun to crack down on corruption within Mexico's legal 
system. What purpose would it serve to rub official Mexico's noses in the 
verdict? 
</P>
<P>
The better tribute to "Kiki" Camarena -- and the many other U.S. and Mexican 
policemen who have died in the drug war -- would be to work harder, and more 
cooperatively, to defeat the brutal criminal organizations who plotted their 
deaths.

POND WILL BE LOWERED IN FIGHT ON MOSQUITOES; 
</P>
<P>
INSECTS: OFFICIALS SAY DRAINING PART OF THE CHATSWORTH RESERVOIR WILL REDUCE 
THE PEST PROBLEM WITHOUT ENDANGERING OTHER WILDLIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Part of a 10-acre pond and marsh in the Chatsworth Reservoir that serves as a 
wildlife refuge will be drained to combat a mosquito infestation that has 
plagued nearby residents, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement on how to control the mosquitoes without harming wildlife was 
worked out at a meeting Tuesday between representatives of several agencies, 
including the Southeast Mosquito Abatement District, the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power, which owns the reservoir, and the city Department of Animal 
Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the DWP will lower the pond, which is about five feet 
deep in places, by 16 inches and will remove about 40% of the tule plants, or 
bulrushes, along the shore. 
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes thrive in the water and thick vegetation, which also prevents 
mosquito fish that live in the pond from getting to the insects, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-term solution to a bad problem," said Sabrina Brummond, public 
information officer for the South Gate-based mosquito control district, which 
operates in most of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The wildlife pond, a remnant of what was once a big lake in the 1,320-acre 
reservoir, is used by waterfowl and other birds, raccoons, deer and coyotes. 
Wildlife officials were concerned that a more complete draining of the pond 
would hurt the animals and send them into residential areas to slake their 
thirst. 
</P>
<P>
But Gary Olsen, district supervisor for the animal regulation department, said 
he believed the agencies "came up with a reasonable solution that would abate 
the mosquito problem and also not endanger any of the wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
DWP crews are expected to start pumping water from the pond Wednesday, although 
officials said the project could take several weeks to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Reservoir neighbors have complained about hordes of mosquitoes, and Brummond of 
the abatement district said trapping by district entomologists confirmed an 
unprecedented number of the insects. 
</P>
<P>
Mosquito traps placed in the reservoir in late June netted 27,000 mosquitoes in 
a 12-hour period, compared to a norm of several hundred captured in a 24-hour 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Brummond said tests have not been conducted to determine if the mosquitoes were 
infected with the dangerous St. Louis encephalitis virus. She said the insects 
would be sent to the lab today.

2ND BUCKEY TRIAL ENDS IN DEADLOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
The McMartin Pre-School molestation case leaves most of us disgusted with our 
legal system ("Buckey Jury Deadlocks; Mistrial Is Declared," Part A, July 28). 
</P>
<P>
Everyone involved lost -- parents, defendants and mainly the children. 
</P>
<P>
I personally feel that these children were exploited by being exhibited on the 
talk show circuit and news conferences by their publicity hungry parents. This 
is child abuse at its lowest level. 
</P>
<P>
How many parents would advertise the molestation of their children on national 
TV? Not very many I hope. In fact the majority of the McMartin students were 
not allowed to be viewed on the media.The parents of these kids should take a 
bow.

It is true some new immigrants cannot adapt themselves to the American way of 
life instantly and sometimes cut down trees in their gardens and build walls 
around their houses. 
</P>
<P>
The walls are intended to ensure security, not privacy as Gibson has said. When 
they live here longer and know their environment better, they will give up such 
practices.

According to Lee A. Iacocca a way to increase our revenue is to tap foreign

A 7% business transfer tax could mean a net increase of $42 billion a year for

I was sickened and infuriated to hear of the jury deadlock on Ray Buckey. 
Buckey claims he is innocent. The true innocent are the dozens of helpless 
children and damaged families in this case. 
</P>
<P>
I am a victim of sexual abuse. I was also intimately involved in a child 
molestation case where the victim had physical evidence, testimony from 
psychologists, and a telephone confession from the perpetrator. We watched as 
the accused smirked at the child (who was forced to be present, though she was 
only 6) and laughed at the parents as he plea-bargained (he pleaded guilty to a 
lesser charge) his way to only 30 days in the county jail. Five years later the 
girl and her family are finally leaving therapy from the horror and devastation 
his crime caused. 
</P>
<P>
My heart goes out to the children and the families of the McMartin case. To 
them I say, "I believe you. I know you are telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
For myself I felt there was, could be, no God present to allow such travesties 
to take place, and in your case, to reoccur time after time in useless 
courtrooms. All I can offer is this: In my mind I see God crying too.

VOTE SET ON BUILDING LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A measure on the Nov. 6 ballot will ask San Fernando voters if they want to 
lease the city's old police station to either public or private organizations 
at fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday night approved placing a measure on the ballot 
asking voters what they want to do with the old building at 120 MacNeil St. The 
San Fernando Police Department moved to a new station at 910 1st St. in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under a voter initiative approved in 1986, the City Council is prevented from 
selling, leasing or exchanging the police station property without voters' 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, spearheaded by then-Councilwoman Carmillis Noltemeyer, was 
aimed at thwarting a plan by the City Council to demolish the building, leaving 
the 31,000-square-foot Civic Center land open for development. Noltemeyer has 
since moved out of the community. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the council unanimously appointed Les Barnett as acting 
director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department while a search is 
conducted to replace Dave Watt, the former director who retired last month.

SAN FERNANDO, UNION AT IMPASSE OVER PACT; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRACT: THE TALKS STALLED MAINLY OVER PAY. THE ISSUE GOES TO THE CITY 
COUNCIL, WHICH CAN ORDER MORE TALKS, IMPLEMENT ONE SIDE'S OFFER OR DO NOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Fernando and the union representing half its employees agreed 
Tuesday that they had reached an impasse in their 4-month-old effort to 
negotiate a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Declaration of an impasse, due primarily to disagreements over pay raises, 
sends each side's final contract offer to the San Fernando City Council for 
consideration at its Aug. 20 meeting. The council could implement one side's 
offer for up to a year, force the two sides to return to the bargaining table 
or do nothing, negotiators said. 
</P>
<P>
If the council decides not to act, the impasse would remain until March, when 
the next round of contract talks is scheduled. The pay and benefit scales of 
the old contract, which expired June 30, would continue to apply, but because 
no contract would be in effect, union members would be free to stage a work 
slowdown or to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Local 690 of the California League of City Employees Assn. represents about 60 
of San Fernando's 115 municipal employees. It does not represent the city's 30 
police officers, who belong to a separate union, or management employees, who 
are not unionized. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides said money was the major reason for the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
The city has proposed a two-year contract, retroactive to July 1, which would 
grant workers a 4% pay raise during the first six months and an additional 1.5% 
during the second six months, said Jane Herran, the city's personnel director 
and chief negotiator. Workers would receive a cost-of-living increase of 
between 4% and 6% during the second year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The union has called for a pay increase of 6% for the first six months and 2% 
for the second half of the first year. It is seeking cost of living plus 2% for 
the second year, said Bill Shawhan, the union's general manager and chief 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement came one week after the union sent the city a letter 
unilaterally declaring an impasse in the talks. One union member disclosed the 
impasse declaration in a statement to the press Sunday, an action Herran said 
violated a confidentiality clause agreed to by the two sides before talks began 
April 13. 
</P>
<P>
Shawhan apologized Tuesday for the "breach of protocol" and said the disclosure 
had not been authorized by the union. "That was not appropriate," he said.

CALIFORNIA HAS LOST ITS SHIELD; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: STATE'S DIVERSITY UNLIKELY TO CUSHION THE IMPACT OF RECESSION AND 
MASSIVE DEFENSE LAYOFFS -- IT'S BACK TO 1970. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HENSLEY, David Hensley is director of California forecasting for the 
UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent weeks, the economic outlook for California has markedly deteriorated. 
The sudden flurry of negative news on the U.S. economy indicates that the 
nation is falling into recession. Should it tumble, California will certainly 
not be spared. Worse, the situation in California increasingly resembles that 
of 1970, when the state was severely hurt by the one-two punch of national 
recession and massive defense layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
After drifting for months, the national economy is gaining momentum -- 
downward. The initial estimate of second-quarter gross national product, 
released July 27, was abysmal. For the first time since the 1981-82 recession, 
real final sales -- led by declines in consumption, investment and net exports 
-- fell. Only inventory accumulation and a surge in government spending 
prevented real GNP from declining. Then the government reported that employment 
declined by 220,000 in July -- by 60,000 even after accounting for the loss of 
census workers. 
</P>
<P>
These two reports signal that the United States is either already in or about 
to be in recession. Compounding the problem is Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which 
is driving oil prices sharply higher. Since more expensive oil means higher 
price inflation, long-term interest rates are moving up. As a result, the most 
promising method of avoiding recession -- an attempt by the Federal Reserve to 
lower long-term interest rates -- has been derailed for now. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and California 
economies, the outlook for the state is thus decidedly more negative. Much has 
been made of the California economy's industrial diversity, which has enabled 
it to avoid the kind of slowdowns that have afflicted nearly every other region 
of the country. But this same diversity also virtually guarantees that the 
state will follow the nation into recession. The state's economy is already 
showing signs of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A precipitous decline in California home-building. As recently as last 
December, building permits for single-family units were being processed at 
annual rates of 160,000 units. Since then, they have fallen each month, 
reaching an annual rate of 98,000 in June. In Los Angeles County, new permits 
are off by 50% from last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Construction employment, flat since February, seems poised for a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Statewide employment growth is running 25% behind 1989's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Help-wanted advertising in Los Angeles, as reflected in the Los Angeles 
Times, is in the midst of the biggest percentage decline not associated with an 
outright recession in 30 years. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of 
help-wanted ads placed with The Times in July was down 13% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lackluster retail sales. Growth in California retail sales has been slow 
since last August, barely keeping pace with price inflation. Statewide sales of 
building materials declined in four of the past five months ending in April 
(the most recent month available), the first such declines since the 1981-82 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Myriad fiscal problems at all levels of California government. 
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop, Lockheed and General 
Dynamics have scheduled layoffs of 15,000 to 20,000 workers for later this 
year. Large numbers of construction workers, meanwhile, will lose their jobs as 
the bottom falls out of the housing market. These two sectors have contributed 
350,000 new jobs during the state's current expansion. That number triples when 
multiplier effects are factored in. The sharp reversal in aerospace and 
construction employment already augured a much slower near-term economy, 
because no other sector is expected to accelerate to offset the losses. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to 1970: Massive defense and space-related layoffs exacerbated 
economic damage caused by the national recession. Indeed, the damage was deeper 
and more widespread in California than elsewhere. Employment growth fell below 
that of the United States; the jobless rate soared to 8.8%, three percentage 
points about the national average. Net immigration plummeted, from 200,000 in 
1968 to a record low of 96,000 by 1970. Ironically, a boom in home construction 
(the result of a housing recession in the mid-'60s) prevented the slowdown from 
being even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is too early to predict whether the harsh experience of 1970 will 
be repeated, it is unambiguously clear that California's previous position of 
economic strength, relative to the United States, is fading and will not shield 
it against a future downturn.

SHOOTING OURSELVES IN THE FOOT; 
</P>
<P>
THE U.S. RESPONSE TO IRAQ -- NOT IRAQ'S ACTION -- HAS PRECIPITATED AN OIL 
CRISIS. WE HAVE ONLY OURSELVES TO BLAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's frenzied response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is surely 
ill-considered. Engineering a U.N. trade embargo and talking up a military 
blockade are themselves precipitating the very oil crisis that the Iraqi 
invasion supposedly threatened to bring about. U.S. paratroops are said to be 
en route to Saudi Arabia. It is as though a nervous householder, hearing that 
an armed robber is in his neighborhood, pulls out a pistol and shoots himself. 
The stock market has dropped and the price of oil has soared, but these 
probably are as much in reaction to the exaggerated U.S. response as they are 
to Saddam Hussein's invasion. 
</P>
<P>
We are told that the Security Council's 13-0 vote for an embargo was "welcomed 
by many participants" as a sign that the United Nations is emerging from "Cold 
War paralysis." Perhaps a certain degree of paralysis was not a bad thing. The 
consensus now is that since we have the Soviets on our side, we no longer need 
fear nuclear confrontation and can swing happily into action against anyone we 
dislike. This may be seen in retrospect as a green light to rashness. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion of Kuwait, of course, is to be deplored. The world would be a 
nicer place if such things did not happen. Iraq and Kuwait together produce 
about one-twelfth of the world's oil. It is a cliche, but nonetheless true, to 
say that "the oil weapon" is a destabilizing one in today's "interdependent 
world." But a few points seem to have been overlooked: 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein was certainly planning to sell Kuwait's oil, not hold it off the 
market to drive up the price. As we have been told repeatedly, his long war 
with Iran impoverished Iraq; Hussein owes his creditors at least $60 billion. 
Withholding production in order to force the price up helps other producers at 
the expense of one's own bank balance. Such altruism has proven to be rare 
among oil producers, which is why the OPEC cartel has never worked very well. 
</P>
<P>
We are also led to believe that Hussein plans to invade Saudi Arabia, as a 
result gaining control of even more oil, and that we should stop him before he 
does this. Unless and until he does, we should stay out. President Bush's order 
Tuesday, sending thousands of U.S. troops for purposes that were not made 
clear, is exactly the sort of gesture that invites a megalomaniac response. 
</P>
<P>
We should not assume that the defunct Kuwaiti emirate was a pocket of 
constitutional and democratic enlightenment in the Middle East. It was little 
more than a wealthy oligarchy, importing guest workers to do the manual labor, 
lavishing welfare benefits on favored subjects and, with its ample spare cash, 
bankrolling the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The governing principle of our foreign policy, and of the United Nations 
itself, seems to be that it doesn't matter what governments do to their own 
subjects, just so long as they respect one another's jurisdiction. For 
President Bush, foreign policy seems to mean governments helping governments. 
If one government finds its prerogatives curtailed by another, however, the 
whole world is supposed to become incensed. "Collective action" is then called 
for, as Margaret Thatcher keeps reminding us. But it is hard to understand why 
Americans are supposed to become outraged -- and pay more at the pump -- 
because Kuwait's oil is now controlled by a tyrant in a military uniform rather 
than by oligarchs in traditional attire. 
</P>
<P>
If Americans feel they have the right to depose one Arab ruler because they 
suspect him of harboring military ambitions, they had better have a good idea 
of who will replace him. If Saddam Hussein goes, who comes after him? You can 
be sure that the State Department doesn't have the slightest idea. It wasn't so 
long ago, remember, that we were supporting Hussein in his war against Iran. 
Why? One reason, in case you had forgotten, was that he was "secular," and, to 
that extent, supposedly enlightened, by comparison with the Ayatollah 
Khomeiniand his fundamentalist zealots. Well, if we keep on playing Morally 
Superior Policeman, we had better be prepared for an Arab world swarming with 
fundamentalist zealots who will make Saddam Hussein look judicious by 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
As Dan Rather's recent reporting from Jordan makes clear, people in the region 
view themselves less as citizens of particular countries than brother Arabs 
facing Western powers that arrogate to themselves both the right to buy Arab 
oil and to dictate which Arab, precisely, controls which slice of territory. 
How would we feel if the state governments of California and Arizona came to 
blows over water rights, and Arab leaders responded by hectoring us in the 
United Nations and "peacemaking" Arab warships began showing up over the 
horizon? 
</P>
<P>
Is it "right" that we are so moralistically projecting? Or is it might? I used 
to think that the rhetoric about "U.S. imperialism" was stale and exaggerated. 
Now I'm not so sure.

KILLEA'S BILL ON CONFIDENTIAL POLICE HEARINGS IS SIDETRACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial bill by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) to make sure police 
personnel files are kept confidential during civil service hearings was 
sidetracked and essentially killed Tuesday by an Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly's Public Service Committee refused to pass the measure and instead 
consigned it to an interim hearing to be held after the legislative session 
adjourns Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
That procedural move guarantees that the measure will not pass the Legislature 
this year, sending Killea back to square one in her attempt to guard the 
confidentiality of the police records. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue will not go away," Killea said Tuesday after the hearing. "The 
public is increasingly concerned about the actions of peace officers and has a 
right to know whether their law enforcement agencies respond appropriately to 
allegations of misconduct by an officer. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the enthusiasm to discover misconduct must be tempered with the 
respect of an individual's right to privacy and safety," said Killea. 
</P>
<P>
Killea's measure would make the police personnel records available to civilian 
review boards but seal them for civil service hearings, a provision that drew 
opposition from newspapers, the American Civil Liberties Union and the city of 
San Diego, which conducts its civil service hearings in public. 
</P>
<P>
The groups claimed that Killea's bill was an attempt to restrict the public's 
right to know about police personnel problems. 
</P>
<P>
However, Killea said her measure would require police departments to report 
statistics about police discipline and allow the personnel records to become 
public in civil or criminal court cases. The measure, she added, was designed 
to prevent newspapers from obtaining charges and testimony against police 
officers through what she claimed was the back door of civil service 
proceedings.

SANTA CATARINA DEVELOPER SUBMITS NEW PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer who proposed the controversial Santa Catarina project, rejected 
by the Santa Clarita City Council last month, has submitted to the city a new 
plan for the site. 
</P>
<P>
In a July 31 letter to City Manager George Caravalho, the developer, Dan Palmer 
of G.H. Palmer Associates, did not specify the number of units he wants to 
build. But Palmer said the new project would take into consideration the 
objections of homeowners, who said the Santa Catarina proposal was too large 
and would destroy a nearby stream. 
</P>
<P>
As a "healing gesture of good faith," Palmer offered to extend Golden Valley 
Road from Soledad Canyon Road to Ermine Street, thus providing the city with a 
badly needed route into the Blue Sky Mesa neighborhood in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy reacted cautiously Tuesday to the Palmer letter. "I just 
don't know what to say," she said. "I don't know enough about it yet." The 
council is scheduled to consider the request next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the Santa Catarina plan polarized the city and left homeowners, 
City Council members and the developer bitter and angry after months of lengthy 
public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The council wanted Palmer to provide millions of dollars in road improvements 
in exchange for city approval of the Santa Catarina project. But ultimately, 
the roads-for-condos swap became too complex and controversial. The council 
voted 4 to 1 last month to kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Palmer dropped what had been a confrontational stance with the 
city and appealed for cooperation between Santa Clarita and his company. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the Santa Catarina project was met with what recently became 
insurmountable political opposition," Palmer wrote, "it would be unfortunate 
for either of us to let some very focused opposition frustrate this otherwise 
popular and uniquely positive opportunity for the broader community." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer wrote that he and Caravalho should "stand together before the City 
Council in unified support of a pared down, less controversial agreement that 
preserves and provides the benefits that the city has worked so hard to 
obtain." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer also touched on the city's tentative approval of another Palmer 
Associates effort known as The Colony, an 800-unit condominium complex in 
Canyon Country. The council had said approval of The Colony would become final 
only after the city resolved the Santa Catarina issue. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Palmer asked the city to give The Colony final approval. In 
return, he promised that he would build the Golden Valley Road extension and 
allow a second proposed road, Rio Vista, to cross through another Palmer 
housing development now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said he would build Golden Valley Road even though there no guarantees 
the city would later approve a new housing project for the Santa Catarina site.

COUNCIL REVERSES DECISION ON EAST-WEST ROUTE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: ACTION LEAVES THE FATE OF PROPOSED ROUTE 56 PATH THROUGH CARMEL VALLEY 
UP TO COASTAL COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for coastal property owners, the San Diego City Council rescinded 
its earlier controversial decision to link a new east-west freeway to 
Interstate 5 at Carmel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The council also unanimously approved an extension of the proposed highway, 
Route 56, in Rancho Penasquitos at its eastern link with Interstate 15. But, 
after heated and organized opposition from residents in the Carmel Valley area, 
it took back its earlier vote rezoning the freeway route through North City 
West at its the western link to Interstate 5 at the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, however, did not mean that the highway might not eventually link 
that area. The council's action leaves the fate of the western link to the 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Route 56, which has been in state highway plans for a quarter of a century, is 
designed to link fast-growing inland communities with coastal freeways near Del 
Mar. Coastal residents have opposed the route, while inland residents have 
pushed for its construction to relieve near-gridlock on Interstate 15 during 
heavy commuting hours. 
</P>
<P>
The action rescinding an earlier rezoning of the freeway route through Carmel 
Valley came in response to a successful petition campaign by the Carmel Valley 
Coalition, a group of property owners along the western end of the proposed 
freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition gathered nearly 50,000 signatures on referendum petitions calling 
for the council members either to change the alignment through Carmel Valley or 
to put the measure to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
When the petitions, turned in last week, proved to have sufficient signatures 
to force the measure to a vote, the city clerk's staff hurried it onto the 
council's Tuesday agenda, the last meeting agenda before their four-week 
"legislative recess," so that council members could decide whether to place it 
on the Nov. 6 ballot -- at a cost of about $40,000 -- rather than delaying the 
decision until their return in September when the deadline for the Nov. 6 
ballot would be past. A special election on the freeway issue would cost about 
$850,000, City Atty. John Witt estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected a motion to place the issue on the Nov. 6 ballot by a 3-4 
vote, then agreed 6 to 1 to rescind its earlier zoning action, after Asst. City 
Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick advised that its action probably would not affect the 
construction of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The zoning ordinance was adopted at the insistence of the (state) Coastal 
Commission staff," Fitzpatrick said, explaining that rezoning of a small 
portion of the freeway route from residential use to open space would make it 
easier for the commission staff to recommend approval of the route to the 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ellen Lirley, spokeswoman for the regional Coastal Commission staff, 
said she was unaware of such a request. "I am sure that we would not have 
required the city to take such an action," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the Coastal Commission will take up the Route 56 issue along with 
a number of other road and highway improvements in the Del Mar-North City West 
area during its Sept. 11-14 meeting in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot see how rescinding the zoning action can affect the freeway, except 
perhaps to move the alignment a few feet or so to the south," Lirley said. "It 
possibly could delay construction, but not stop it." 
</P>
<P>
The Carmel Valley Coalition wants to detour the $28-million, 2-mile-long Route 
56 alignment out of Carmel Valley and move the route south, outside the 
developed portions of North City West. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McNamara, president of the Rancho Penasquitos Town Council and head of 
the newly-formed Save 56 group, told council members that the rescinding of 
their earlier action would have "absolutely no effect" on Route 56. He 
challenged the council to put the issue to a citywide vote because "we are 
willing to spend the time and money to find out what the people of San Diego 
really think about selfish neighborhoods" of North City West that oppose the 
cross-county freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Mailhot, co-chairman of the Carmel Valley Coalition, said the group does 
not oppose construction of Route 56 but does oppose having it run through North 
City West's established neighborhoods. That plan also would have threatened 
sensitive wetlands around Penasquitos Lagoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several environmental spokesmen unsuccessfully sought Tuesday to have the 
council to delay approval of the half-mile eastern link between Rancho 
Penasquitos Boulevard and Black Mountain Road because it would run through a 
nesting site of the California gnatcatcher, a bird that is a candidate for 
endangered species status. 
</P>
<P>
However, Caltrans has required the county to provide a gnatcatcher nesting site 
in Ramona to mitigate for loss of a similar-sized site in the path of the route 
through a Rancho Penasquitos Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Maureen O'Connor interrupted Bernhardt to remind her that the action 
approving the eastern segment of Route 56 already had been taken and that 
further discussion was improper. 
</P>
<P>
The east-west freeway probably will not be completed before the year 2000, a 
Caltrans engineer said, because of the problems with financing the middle 
portion of the 9-mile route between I-15 and I-5. The alignment runs through 
the city of San Diego's urban reserve, where major development requires 
citywide voter approval, he said. Without developer contributions, no funding 
for the middle part of the route is available.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SOMEHOW ONE SENSES A LACK OF SINCERITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a $400,000 settlement was reached last year in the so-called "poll-guard" 
lawsuit, the plaintiffs earmarked $150,000 for a massive voter registration and 
education effort in Orange County's Latino community. Creating a fund for that 
purpose was generous and fitting, but what's happened to those funds since is a 
real disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was brought against the Orange County Republican Party and the 
campaign of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) by plaintiffs who said 
there had been intimidation of Latino voters in the November, 1988, election by 
uniformed security guards at several polling places in Santa Ana. The county 
GOP, which hired the guards at the request of Pringle's political consultant, 
said it responded to rumors that Democrats planned to bus illegal voters to the 
72nd Assembly District to tip the election in favor of Pringle's opponent. 
Nevertheless, the incident left a bad feeling among Latinos, and criminal 
investigations by the county and federal prosecutors are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, it appears that most of the money set aside for the 
nonpartisan voter registration and education project is not being utilized. 
Unless something is done quickly, a huge opportunity to increase Latino voters 
by as many as 30,000 before the Nov. 6 election will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money -- about $48,000 -- was given to the Hispanic Political 
Council, an organization created in 1988 by a Santa Ana construction workers 
union. But so far only a pittance -- $1,200 -- has gone toward voter 
registration, according to financial statements filed with the county registrar 
of voters. The council spent $3,000 to rent a hall for a fund-raiser and $4,400 
was loaned out. Records indicate that about $42,000 of council money remains 
unspent. 
</P>
<P>
Of the rest, $4,000 was given to a national voter registration project, which 
used it to support Latino candidates -- none from Orange County; $7,800 was 
given to a group for a registration project that hasn't gotten off the ground, 
and $90,000 is being held by the lawyer who represented the plaintiffs. He says 
he hasn't gotten around to organizing a voter registration drive in Orange 
County, which is understandable since his firm is in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
If there's to be a successful drive to register Latino voters, it must come 
from the community itself. The money is there, but someone must make sure the 
money is spent as intended. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs have done their part. It's time for others to do the rest.

Olympic organizers probably thought they had a tough time getting Los Angeles 
ready for the 1984 Games. Their counterparts in Beijing have it much worse. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in the Chinese capital are eager to put the best possible face on a 
society beset by AIDS, cholera, mosquitoes, rats, flies and cockroaches as the 
city prepares to play host to the Asian Games, which open Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
One measure was announced this week: Beijing residents caught spitting in 
public places will (a) have to clean up their mess and (b) pay a fine of five 
yuan ($1.06), roughly equivalent to a day's pay. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Evening News noted that the new fine is 10 times higher than the 
previous one. Also, the newspaper said, if an offender refuses to pay, the 
penalty will be doubled or tripled, depending on his or her attitude.

Trivia time: Which Heisman Trophy winner played for four NFL teams? 
</P>
<P>
Employment barrier: From Tom Whitfield of the Atlanta Journal: In 1960, Coach 
Hank Stram faced his first cut with the Dallas Texans of the American Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
At practice, Stram noticed team owner Lamar Hunt about to begin his personal 
workout with a 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt ran it in 5.1 seconds. Stram yelled: "Hey, you receivers and backs. We're 
cutting everybody that can't run faster than the owner." 
</P>
<P>
Check his cap: Left-handed knuckleball pitcher Daniel Boone, 36, 
whosegreat-great-great-great-great-great-great uncle was the Daniel Boone, 
recently threw a seven-inning no-hitter in a doubleheader for the Rochester Red 
Wings, Baltimore's triple-A farmclub. 
</P>
<P>
Their Yankees: On Monday, the German mass-circulation newspaper Bild ran the 
headline: "Bayern, ha ha ha." 
</P>
<P>
A headline in the Cologne Express said: "The whole of Germany is laughing at 
Bayern." 
</P>
<P>
That's what powerful Bayern Munich, which won the Super Cup soccer tournament 
eight times, got for losing to an amateur team in the opening round of this 
year's competition. 
</P>
<P>
Digging himself a deeper hole, Uli Hoeness, coach of the professional club, 
blamed the heat wave sweeping Europe. Hoeness told Agence France-Presse: "This 
never would have happened in normal weather conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Unkindest cut: When pro golfers on the Ben Hogan Tour played the Woodlands 
Country Club in Falmouth, Me., this year, 53 players survived the cut. All it 
took was a nine-over-par 153. 
</P>
<P>
Very narrow fairways, slick greens and windy conditions produced only one 
subpar finish. Brandel Chamblee won the tournament at one under par, and Jeff 
Maggert finished second at even par. 
</P>
<P>
Try a Detroit Tiger: Bob Sargent, the national sales manager for Homers Cookies 
-- "the official cookie of major league baseball" -- looks down his nose at 
comparisons between his company's little shortbread figures, cut in six 
different baseball positions, and a more familiar shortbread product, animal 
crackers. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sargent: "One thing that always got me about animal crackers was that you 
couldn't tell one animal from another." 
</P>
<P>
What? 
</P>
<P>
Up in the air: The New York Jets' starting quarterback job is a tossup between 
Tony Eason and Ken O'Brien. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
When the Jets held their first scrimmage, Eason noticed he was ahead of O'Brien 
on the depth chart. He asked Coach Bruce Coslet: "Is that by alphabetical 
order?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Coslet: "Alphabetical? It's much more scientific. We flipped a coin . . . 
twice."

CROW, SOCKERS AGREE ON 1-YEAR DEAL 
</P>

<P>
Kevin Crow became the fourth member of the Sockers' 1989-90 championship team 
who will return for '90-91 when he signed a one-year contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Crow, selected the Major Soccer League's defensive player of the year an 
unprecedented three times, joined Branko Segota, Victor Nogueira and Paul 
Wright as players under contract for next season. 
</P>
<P>
In signing a one-year deal for $50,000, Crow is taking a $10,000 cut in pay. 
But the majority of the players in the MSL are taking pay cuts because of the 
league's reduced salary cap of $630,000, which has made nearly every player a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Crow is a former San Diego State star and the Sockers' all-time leader in games 
played, having joined the team in 1983 as a second-round draft choice. 
Remaining in San Diego, he said, was the primary reason for his re-signing. 
</P>
<P>
"My home is San Diego. This is where my wife and I have decided we're going to 
settle down, and I don't see any reason to leave," Crow said. "As long as the 
Sockers are here, I'm healthy and still got the energy and desire to go out and 
win, I'll be here. That's basically the reason." 
</P>
<P>
Sockers' Coach Ron Newman was especially pleased to have Crow back because 
defenders George Fernandez and Ralph Black have left in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Waad Hirmez and Brian Quinn are among other Sockers who have yet to re-sign. 
Newman said Quinn is expected to return. Hirmez is unhappy with the team's 
latest offer to him, $12,000 less than he made last year.

TENNIS: SECOND-SEEDED PLAYER'S CALF MUSCLE IS INJURED DURING PRACTICE FOR SAN 
DIEGO TOURNAMENT. SHE HOPES TO BE READY FOR L.A. COMPETITION.

<P>
What tennis fans had hoped would be a showdown Sunday between the two top 
female players in the world, No. 1 Steffi Graf and No. 2 Martina Navratilova, 
won't take place. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova suffered an injured calf muscle during a practice set Monday 
against doubles partner Gigi Fernandez, and withdrew from the Great American 
Bank tennis tournament Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said that although she is a quick healer, she would have to monitor 
the injury a day at a time. She said she is unsure whether she will be ready to 
play at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, beginning Aug. 13 in Manhattan 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be able to play next week," Navratilova said, "but certainly not 
(Wednesday). I'm hoping three or four days. The doctor said two or three weeks, 
but I'm a little more optimistic. I'll take it on a day-by-day basis." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said she bent down low to hit a slice backhand when her left foot 
slipped and she jammed her Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
"The ground is porous and normally my foot would have held," she said, "but it 
didn't. I was still getting used to the footing." 
</P>
<P>
This was to be Navratilova's first tournament since she won her record ninth 
singles title at Wimbledon. She had planned to play back-to-back events here 
and in Manhattan Beach to prepare her for the U.S. Open, beginning Aug. 27 in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Seeded second, Navratilova was to play Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer in a 
first-round match Tuesday night. She was replaced by Luanne Spadea of Boca 
Raton, Fla., in singles, and by former San Diego State All-American Monique 
Javer and Spadea in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank-Nideffer made short work of Navratilova's replacement, winning 7-5, 
6-1 before of 3,875. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement that Navratilova had withdrawn came after Graf's 6-0, 6-3 
afternoon singles victory over Oceanside's Stephanie Rehe, a wild-card entrant. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, seeded first, said Navratilova's withdrawal will have no effect on how 
she prepares for the rest of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no difference," Graf said. "I'll still prepare the same way to get 
myself ready for the next match." 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Zina Garrison, Wimbledon finalist this year and runner-up to Graf 
in this event last year, had her opening match delayed a day because of a bout 
with flu. Garrison's coach, Sherwood Stewart, said she will be ready for her 
singles match today against Fernandez, which follows the 11 a.m. center-court 
match between Patty Fendick and Manuela Maleeva. 
</P>
<P>
"She could have played singles (Tuesday)," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
"But she was a little sick Saturday night and I asked them if she could delay 
her first (singles) match a day." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Navratilova is a mixed blessing for Coronado's Angelica Gavaldon. 
Had she advanced to tonight's second round, Navratilova and Gavaldon would have 
played in the featured match on center court. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great experience to play Martina," Gavaldon said last Friday 
immediately after the draw was made. "But everyone looks forward to playing a 
top player." 
</P>
<P>
Like Gavaldon, Oceanside's Stehpanie Rehe, formerly of Highland, Calif., was 
looking forward to playing a top player. But Graf is no longer suffering from 
the sinus problems that plagued her at Wimbledon and she played at full 
strength against Rehe, winning, 6-0, 6-3. Rehe scored only nine points in the 
first set.

FISHING REPORT: CATFISH AT MOST SITES; STRIPERS IN SOME AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's catfish and more catfish at most Southland reservoirs, but two offer an 
alternative -- striped bass. 
</P>
<P>
The bite is rated fair at San Bernardino County's Silverwood Lake, where Paul 
Offerdahl of Mira Loma caught a 26-pound striper. In Los Angeles County's 
Pyramid Lake, Ed Kurihara of Monterey Park took 14-, nine- and five-pound 
stripers, while Ernie Benabidez of La Crescenta landed a 15 1/2-pounder.

HUNT FOR DEER MIGHT BECOME SECONDARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The general deer hunting season opens in the state's largest zone Saturday, and 
experts advise hunters to do what the deer have to do: Look for water. 
</P>
<P>
Zone A, encompassing 26 counties, extends along the California coast from Santa 
Monica to within about 125 miles of the Oregon border and inland along 
California 99, an area suffering from a four-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some water left in scattered locations, (but) good water sources are 
few and hard to find," said Larry Sitton, wildlife management supervisor in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Hunters who have scouted for water sources are expected to have the best 
chance. Last year, 6,847 of 53,924 hunters -- 15% -- were successful in taking 
a legal buck (forked horn or better) in Zone A. The season ends Sept. 23. 
Archery season ran from July 14 to last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sitton suggested that the better areas would be Ojai ranger district of the Los 
Padres National Forest, the Nordhoff Peak area east of California 33 and south 
of Sespe Creek, the southern tip of Los Padres National Forest, and the Potrero 
Seco area. 
</P>
<P>
Hunters were alerted to extreme fire danger and were advised that some areas 
could be closed because of dry conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hinckley of Fullerton was fishing in the right company when he caught a 
record-size 333.4-pound Pacific halibut near Gustavus, Alaska, last week. His 
wife, Jean, holds the 12-pound-test line class record for albacore with a 
57-pound 12-ounce catch off Pt. Loma in 1982, and his fishing pal, James McAdam 
Jr., has the all-tackle world record for giant sea bass -- 563 pounds 8 ounces, 
at Anacapa Island in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley's halibut would have been a line-class record, except for a couple of 
technicalities. Instead of gaffing the fish, the crew first harpooned it twice, 
then had to shoot it to subdue it. A large halibut can destroy a small boat. 
</P>
<P>
The fish was eight feet long, a foot thick and three feet wide. Another boat 
had to be summoned to assist in getting the fish aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial Columbia River-Pacific Ocean SHARK Tournament last weekend 
failed to fulfill concerns of opponents who feared it would attract a dangerous 
number of sharks to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four entrants caught four sharks, the largest 56 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The drought isn't all bad. Bob Tanner, who operates the Red's Meadow Pack 
Station out of Mammoth Lakes, said the lower water levels will provide an 
unusual opportunity for good back-country fly fishing next month. 
</P>
<P>
"With the low water, there is less food floating in," Tanner said. "What it 
means is you're getting October fishing in (August and) September." 
</P>
<P>
And the onset of winter makes the high Eastern Sierra difficult to fish in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
For non-anglers, the scenery alone can be worth the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in awfully good shape," Tanner said. "We had some good rains in July and 
may get some more this week. The horse food in the mountains is excellent. The 
grass is green." 
</P>
<P>
With most outfitters, a customer has the option of riding in with his pack mule 
or hiking and letting the mule carry the load. Tanner noted a change over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The age group that used the trails in the '60s went to work and didn't have 
time for backpacking anymore," he said. "Now we see them coming back with their 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
A new federal ruling establishes stiff penalties for dumping trash overboard 
and requires all commercial and recreational boats 26 feet or longer to display 
a placard stating that such dumping is illegal. The ruling, which went into 
effect July 31, provides for civil penalties of as much as $25,000 and criminal 
penalties of as much as $50,000 and five years in jail. Placards are available 
by calling (800) 237-8663. . . . Toll-free whitewater rafting information is 
available by phoning the California Western River Guides Assn. at (800) 
552-3625. 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Game Commission has scheduled a meeting in Sacramento Thursday to 
consider certifying environmental documents for dove and bandtailed pigeon 
hunts. Adoption of the hunts was postponed last week because of the threat of a 
legal challenge. . . . The commission authorized doubling ptarmigan permits to 
100 in Alpine and Mono counties, where the state's first hunt was conducted 
last year. . . . DFG wildlife biologist Denyse Racine will lead a free tour to 
observe tule elk Aug. 18, starting at 8 a.m. at the wildlife viewpoint six 
miles south of Big Pine on California 395.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
GIANTS LOSE THIRD STRAIGHT, 4-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After last Saturday's action, the San Francisco Giants seemed ready to take 
command of the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
They had cut a 14 1/2-game lead to 3 1/2 and the Cincinnati Reds appeared to be 
on the verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few days later, it is the Giants who seem to be falling apart and the 
Reds have increased their lead to six games. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Portugal reached his high mark of the season against the Giants Tuesday 
night at Houston. Portugal (5-9) gave up five hits in 7 2/3 innings and struck 
out a career high eight in the Astros' 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' skid began Sunday, in a 12-6 loss to the Dodgers, and now their 
bats have stopped booming. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night against Bill Gullickson, the Giants managed to score one run. 
</P>
<P>
The big three in the middle, Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams have 
suddenly lost power and the Giants are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
For the season the three have hit 61 home runs and driven in 219 runs. In the 
last two games they are a combined 5 for 24 without a home run or an RBI. Clark 
has not hit a home run in his last 108 at-bats. It's the longest Clark has ever 
gone without hitting one. 
</P>
<P>
Giant starter John Burkett (10-4) pitched brilliantly. He retired the first 
nine Astros before Eric Yelding singled to open the fourth. Yelding eventually 
scored on Franklin Stubbs' sacrifice fly. It was the only run Burkett gave up 
on four hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
A passed ball and a wild pitch helped the Astros break it open with three in 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"If we play a little better than a high school team they don't score in the 
eighth," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "All we had to do is play the way we 
normally do. We wasted a good pitching performance." 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' Bill Doran was two for three and is 14 for 26 in a seven-game 
hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Montreal 3 -- Instead of the New York Mets pulling away in the 
East, it's the Pirates who have been hot, winning six of their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Pittsburgh, the Pirates won in the 12th, as Jose Lind opened 
the inning with a double, went to third on a bunt and scored standing up on Jay 
Bell's long fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Bream homered in the eighth to give the Pirates, who are 51-1 in games they 
lead after eight, a 3-2 lead. But an error by third baseman Jeff King with two 
out in the ninth enabled the Expos to tie. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 9, New York 0 -- Rookie Jose DeJesus allowed just two hits at New 
York and pitched his first shutout as the Mets lost their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was because the start was delayed 100 minutes because of rain, but 
Frank Viola, going for his 16th victory, had one of his worst outings. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up six runs on eight hits in 5I innings. 
</P>
<P>
Viola would have had to be at his best just to stay even with DeJesus. He gave 
up a single to Daryl Boston in the second and another to Darryl Strawberry in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, St. Louis 3 -- Ryne Sandberg hit just his second home run since the 
All-Star break, but it came at an opportune time at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg hit the home run after Jerome Walton reached on an error and his 26th 
homer broke the 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was off Scott Terry (1-6) and was not unexpected. Sandberg is 
seven for 15 (.467) against Terry and four of the hits have been home runs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 7-11, Atlanta 2-9 -- Everybody else is picking on the hapless Braves, 
so why not the surging Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Despite three home runs by Dave Justice, the heir to Dale Murphy's right-field 
post, the Padres swept the doubleheader at Atlanta. They have now won 12 of 
their last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
A sparkling performance by Andy Benes (8-8) was the highlight of the opener. In 
the nightcap, the Padres built an 11-2 lead before the Braves rallied. DAN

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WHITE SOX GIVE FERNANDEZ SOME HELP AND HIS FIRST VICTORY, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The White Sox bullpen gave rookie starter Alex Fernandez an assist in Chicago's 
5-3 victory Tuesday night at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez had that coming. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, in his major league debut, he gave up only two runs in seven 
innings and led, 3-2, but the bullpen couldn't hold the lead and deprived 
Fernandez of the victory. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Fernandez (1-0) went six innings, giving up three runs, and the 
bullpen came up with the save in a 5-3 victory over the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Sosa and Scott Fletcher each drove in two runs for the White Sox, who 
came back from a 2-0 deficit to win for the sixth time in their last seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"This club has character, the ability to bounce back," White Sox Manager Jeff 
Torborg said. "Our young pitchers have come through for us. 
</P>
<P>
"What everyone said about Fernandez is true. He has poise, composure, 
instincts. He's got all it takes to be a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez hasn't wasted much time in his career. In 1989, he felt he was ready 
for the majors when he had 15 victories for the University of Miami. In order 
to be eligible for this June's draft, Fernandez transferred to a junior 
college. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox made him their No. 1 choice. After a brief stint in the minors, 
he appears to be ready to lend a hand in Chicago's stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have my best stuff," the 20-year-old right-hander said. "I went out 
there and battled every pitch. On nights like this that's all you can do. My 
job was to keep us in it." 
</P>
<P>
The Royals' Brian McRae, whose father, Hal, was a longtime favorite in Kansas 
City, made an auspicious major league debut against Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 27,240 gave the rookie McRae a standing ovation when he tripled in 
his first at-bat in the second inning. He also singled in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 3, Baltimore 2 -- There was a power outage that lasted for 18 minutes 
at Oakland after both teams scored twice in the first inning. When the 
electricity came on, power outage at the plate lasted for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Welch and John Mitchell were in charge most of the way. Welch became the 
major league's first 18-game winner when Walt Weiss singled home Ron Hassey to 
break the tie in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, who has lost four, gave up seven hits in seven innings, settling down 
after giving up two runs in the first inning on a double by Sam Horn. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some opportunities early to do Welch in, but he wouldn't allow us to. 
He pitched from here," said Oriole Manager Frank Robinson, pointing to his 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Eckersley got the last four outs for his 36th save and kept the A's 
three games ahead of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 11, Detroit 5 -- The Blue Jays were relying on Jimmy Key to have a good 
season. If he had, they probably would be leading the East instead of chasing 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But Key has had arm problems and has not been consistent. In this game at 
Toronto, he was almost unhittable through seven innings. By the time he 
weakened, the Blue Jays had given him a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
Key (7-5) lost his shutout in the eighth. In the ninth, Alan Trammell, Cecil 
Fielder and Gary Ward opened with consecutive home runs. For Fielder, it was 
his 35th. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit starter Jack Morris (9-14) before he could get anyone out in the 
fourth. He gave up seven hits and eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 8, Texas 4 -- Three errors by the Rangers' infield enabled the 
Indians to stay close at Cleveland and they scored four in the eighth to break 
it open. 
</P>
<P>
Brook Jacoby, Sandy Alomar and Alex Cole hit run-scoring doubles in the big 
inning. The Indians had six doubles, two by Cole. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Colby Ward faced only one batter in the eighth and struck him out to 
earn his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Sierra doubled in the second inning to stretch his hitting streak to 14 
games, then hit a two-run home run in the fourth for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Seattle 1 -- Former Angel pitcher Mike Witt, hampered by injuries 
most of the season, earned his first victory as a Yankee with an impressive 
performance at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Witt (1-4) limited Seattle to four hits in six innings in his sixth start this 
season and 16th appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Maas continued his home run spree, hitting a 448-foot shot. It was his 
12th homer in 94 at-bats since joining the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, Minnesota 3 -- Jaime Navarro (3-3) pitched six perfect innings at 
Minneapolis, then blew a 3-0 lead in the seventh. Robin Yount drove in the 
go-ahead run with a tie-breaking double in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Until the seventh, the Twins had gone 24 innings without scoring. Then, Nelson 
Liriano got an infield hit and Randy Bush hit a home run. DAN HAFNER

RANGERS EYE COMEBACK FROM NBC SERIES DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITTORIO TAFUR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Making their first appearance in the National Baseball Congress World Series, 
the Valley Rangers played Monday night on artificial turf for the first time. 
The result was yet another first -- a 12-2, five-inning shellacking at the 
hands of the Hays (Kan.) 
</P>
<P>
Larks before 1,000 fans, with the Rangers spared further embarrassment because 
of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers, who had not lost by the 10-run rule all season, will try to avoid 
an early exit from the double-elimination tourney today, when they return to 
Lawrence Dumont Stadium in Wichita, Kan. The Rangers will play at 8 a.m. PDT 
against the Palm Beach (Fla.) Bulldogs, who lost Tuesday night to the San Diego 
Stars, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
"The story for us is that we have been loose all year and we were real tight 
(Monday)," Ranger Coach Frank Des Enfants said. "We made mental and physical 
mistakes. I don't think the kids will be tight (today). 
</P>
<P>
"We'll either win or lose. No excuses." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers are the first Valley team since the 1987 Valley Dodgers to have 
earned an NBC World Series berth. 
</P>
<P>
Four Ranger errors contributed to 10 unearned Lark runs, including six in the 
fifth inning. That made the score 12-2, and when Valley was unable to score in 
the bottom of the inning, the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
Des Enfants used four pitchers in the fateful fifth, and they combined to walk 
five batters. The walks and two doubles, a single and an error turned the game 
into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Trainor ended the outburst when he came on to strike out No. 3 hitter 
Todd Jerrich with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger designated-hitter Eric Vargas had two doubles, the first of which 
started a two-run rally in the third inning that made the score 3-2. VITTORIO

TWO AZTEC FRESHMEN FAIL TO MEET ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freshmen John McCartney, a Times' All-County defensive back from Lincoln High, 
and Michael Landry, a cornerback from Marrero, La., have been declared 
ineligible to play football at San Diego State this fall, Coach Al Luginbill 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney failed to score 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and Landry 
a 15 on the American College Test, the minimums required by the NCAA for 
freshman eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, those failing to meet one of the test requirements cannot 
receive athletic scholarships or participate with a team for one year. Players 
also normally lose a year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Luginbill said, McCartney and Landry have decided to stay out of 
school for a year and enter in the fall of 1991 if they can achieve one of the 
required test scores. They will have 12 chances to do so, Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
Their situation is similar to that of Curtis Conway, a quarterback from Los 
Angeles' Hawthorne High who sat out last year but is eligible as a freshman 
this fall at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"We presented (the idea) to them, and their feeling was that the penalty was 
too severe, and they want to prove to everybody that they are capable of 
meeting the minimum requirements," Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
"These young men have made the choice to be at San Diego State in the fall of 
1991, and they will be there. We have made that commitment to them." 
</P>
<P>
With newcomers reporting Thursday for physicals, and the returning players due 
Tuesday, Luginbill said that sophomore linebacker Eric Thompson is the only 
other player not expected to be there. Thompson, who started two games at 
inside linebacker in 1989, has quit the team. Luginbill said he thought about 
quitting during spring practice but changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 recruits (17 freshman, two sophomores), Luginbill said defensive 
backs Damon Pieri, a sophomore from Phoenix College, Steve Rudisill, from 
Thousand Oaks High, and Sam Williford, from Muir High, have the best chances of 
playing this fall.

THE FILM: "Young Guns II" 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE: Billy the Kid, played with gusto by Emilio Estevez, is chased across 
the New Mexico desert by Pat Garrett (played by William Petersen), formerly a 
cattle-rustling compatriot and now a well-dressed sheriff. It's the same old 
story with a sex-appeal spin. Billy's accompanied on this chase to the death by 
his band of Regulators -- Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian 
Slater (pictured), Balthazar Getty and Alan Ruck. They are the Team 
Testosterone. Their down-and-dirty appeal is enhanced by Dean Semler, the 
director of photography, who knows a few things about heroically depicting 
renegades, having done the "Mad Max" trilogy, and backed with songs by Jon Bon 
Jovi, who is no slouch when it comes to stirring young women into a fever of 
lust. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Estevez, Getty and Ruck are dressed prairie style -- bowler hats, 
lumpy wool pants, suspenders, muslin shirts and worn-out boots. Slater's 
character is an aspiring outlaw, Dave Rudabaugh, who would like the same 
notoriety as the Kid. He makes up for his lack of billing by strutting around 
in bad guy-black suede pants and a Stetson (pictured). Sutherland's Doc 
Scurlock wears a period tweed suit that evolves from natty to nasty as his 
character declines from poet and teacher to desperate gunslinger. Phillips as 
Chavez y Chavez wears an ethnic mix that reflects the character's 
Mexican-Indian heritage -- ponchos, feathers and a shearling vest that looks 
decidely as if it was tanned at home, in the tepee. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion victim of the film is Pat Garrett. He is given 50% of his bounty 
payment for capturing the Kid up-front and the first thing he does with his 
new-found wealth is buy new clothes. And such splendid clothes he buys: a black 
ottomon overcoat and a pinstripe three-piece suit. The vest even has jeweled 
buttons. Costume designer Judy Ruskin explained his peacock style, saying: "In 
my research, I found Pat Garrett was quite a fashion plate. He was always very 
well dressed and incredibly vain." 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: Ruskin had almost all of the wardrobe for the principals custom 
made, although some of the accessories were bought off the rack. Estevez's 
suspenders are from Perry Ellis Menswear and Getty's are from Cole-Haan. The 
black cowboy hat that Christian Slater wears carries the Outback Trading Co. 
label. Estevez's long-john shirt was also bought and then customized with a 
muslin placket for period authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
THE PAYOFF: So what if "Young Guns II" is a heavy-metal version of the 48-times 
told tale of Billy the Kid? These guys are a visual delight. GAILE ROBINSON

NEW AND USEFUL: WALKER ABLE TO PUT THE BRAKES ON IMMOBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian inventor Norman Rolston developed Able Walker for seniors and others 
who need help to walk. He said he came up with the idea after watching an 
elderly aunt struggle with a conventional walker. 
</P>
<P>
Able Walker, made of chrome and weighing 15 pounds, is a grocery cart and a 
seat that can hold an individual weighing up to 500 pounds. "My goal," Rolston 
said, "is to get people on the road again. . . . Able Walker may not add years 
to their lives, but it certainly adds life to their years." 
</P>
<P>
The device is adjustable, so it can be used by someone who is 4-foot-10 or 
6-foot-6. It is fitted with handlebars covered with foam grips, four wheels, 
hand brakes and the shopping basket that converts to a seat. It also can be 
turned into a luggage cart. 
</P>
<P>
Able Walker costs $259, including shipping and handling. It comes in one piece 
and requires only the attaching of its brakes, which is "easy to do," the 
firm's California representative said. 
</P>
<P>
To order, contact Able Walker Inc., Building C-2, 1122 Fir Ave., Blaine, Wash. 
98230; (800) 663-1305.

Spray Wax Puts Dent in Car-Care Chores 
</P>
<P>
Carnauba Spray Wax -- introduced by Eagle One, a longtime California 
manufacturer of car-care products -- helps cut down on the time car buffs spend 
with liquid and paste waxes. The aerosol spray contains no fluorocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle representatives said it is the first aerosol spray wax for vehicles. It 
takes about 20 minutes to wax a regular-size car, wiping the spray with a soft, 
dry cloth. 
</P>
<P>
Carnauba Spray Wax costs $5.99 for a 14.5-ounce can that is good for five or 
six waxings. It's available at Chief Auto Parts, Pep Boys, Kragen Auto Parts, 
other automotive stores nationwide and Thrifty Drug Stores. If you can't find 
it in your area, contact Eagle One, 2231 Faraday Ave., Suite 101, Carlsbad, 
Calif. 92008; (619) 931-0784.

<P>
TRIPLE CROSS ISRAEL, THE ATOMIC BOMB, AND THE MAN WHO SPILLED THE SECRETS BY 
LOUIS TOSCANO CAROL PUBLISHING GROUP/BIRCH LANE PRESS $19.95, 321 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's enough sex, spycraft and sheer suspense in "Triple Cross" to rival a 
thriller by Len Deighton or John le Carre. But Louis Toscano's book, the story 
of Mordechai Vanunu and his betrayal of Israel's nuclear secrets, is a work of 
investigative journalism by an experienced foreign correspondent. It's a fast, 
hot and furious read with a story line as urgent as the headlines in today's 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Mordechai Vanunu worked as a technician in the top-secret nuclear complex at 
Dimona in the Negev, where plutonium is recovered from spent fuel rods and 
then, according to Vanunu and his evidence, fashioned into bombs -- or at least 
the makings of bombs. Vanunu claimed that Israel had stockpiled as many as 200 
"screw-ready" atomic bombs, and was capable of making hydrogen and neutron 
bombs. After Vanunu told his story to the Sunday Times of London in 1986, he 
was lured out of Great Britain by a Mossad operative and then spirited back to 
Israel, where he is now serving an 18-year sentence for revealing his country's 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
As Toscano spins out a remarkable story of real-life intrigue, we are 
introduced to a cast of characters so colorful that they might have stepped out 
of a spy novel: Oscar Guerrero, the self-styled journalistic impresario and 
world-class hoaxer who befriended Vanunu; John McKnight, the activist minister 
who converted Vanunu to Christianity and then undertook a public relations 
crusade on his behalf; Cheryl Hanin, the American-born Israeli who baited the 
"honey trap" in which Mossad eventually snagged Vanunu; Amnon Zichroni, the 
flamboyant civil rights activist who went on to make a fortune in corporate law 
but returned to the courtroom to represent Vanunu; and Vanunu himself, a loser 
and a loner who managed to thrust himself into the eye of a diplomatic and 
journalistic hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the fact that Israel possesses nuclear capability is one of the 
great non-secrets of the Middle East, as Toscano readily concedes. The familiar 
and yet enigmatic formulation of Israeli policy -- "Israel will never be the 
first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East" -- has always served 
to create "a surprisingly effective nuclear deterrent." But, Toscano insists, 
Israel decided to turn Vanunu's revelations to its own advantage in a cunning 
and cynical maneuver that he characterizes as the "triple cross" of the book's 
title. 
</P>
<P>
According to Toscano's sources -- who, he says, risked "criminal and political 
liability" by talking to him -- Vanunu's fate was debated in the highest 
circles of the Israeli government even before he went public with his story. 
Shamir, Toscano writes, suggested that the traitor be assassinated, but Peres 
had another idea -- why not allow Vanunu to tell his story to the world press 
and then arrest him? The government would still brand him a liar, but the 
credibility of Israel's nuclear deterrent would only be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
"It would essentially be another leak," Toscano writes, "this time designed to 
warn the Arab world how advanced and powerful the Israeli arsenal had become." 
</P>
<P>
Toscano is not exactly an Israel-basher, but he does make use of Vanunu and his 
various miseries to dramatize all the problems that afflict a beleaguered 
Israel today. And Toscano gamely tries to lionize Vanunu, whom he describes as 
a man with "a deep commitment to basic values like truth, freedom, justice, and 
. . . . equality." It's as if Toscano, after casting Vanunu as a hero rather 
than a villain, can't bear to portray him as something less than heroic. 
</P>
<P>
Vanunu himself never seemed to be able to make up his mind about precisely why 
he was betraying his country's secrets to the world. On Page 5, Toscano reports 
that Vanunu claimed that he took photographs of the Dimona nuclear facility 
"(p)artly as a souvenir." On Page 120, it is suddenly revealed that Vanunu 
wanted to "give Israelis the opportunity denied to them by their government . . 
. to decide the nuclear issue." 
</P>
<P>
But the real reason for Vanunu's treachery, it appears, was less a matter of 
idealism than abject psychological and spiritual crisis. "I am a failure in 
life," Vanunu confided to his own journal. " I am about to explode . . . . I 
want to be left alone and be with myself, with my dirty mind, which then will 
be cleaned of all the filth which has become part of me." Even Toscano is 
finally forced to concede that Vanunu was "a naive misfit . . . a restless 
rebel searching for some cause out of an almost childish pique." 
</P>
<P>
Still, whether or not Vanunu deserves to be called a hero, Toscano expertly 
narrates the conspiracies within conspiracies that swirled around him -- his 
infiltration of the most secret recesses of the Dimona complex and then his 
restless wanderings around the world; the efforts of Guerrero to peddle 
Vanunu's story to the world press (and cut himself in on the score); the 
painstaking investigation undertaken by the Sunday Times to test Vanunu's 
veracity and the authenticity of evidence; and the elaborate espionage 
operations of Mossad, whose agents shadowed Vanunu until they were finally 
authorized to snag him and bring him home. 
</P>
<P>
As much as I admired and enjoyed Toscano's book, I feel compelled to register 
one small complaint -- the text is flawed by a number of typographical errors 
that are the result of cursory proofreading. Toscano is obviously a meticulous 
reporter who cares about getting his story right; I wondered why similar care 
was not extended to the presentation of his work in print.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: DORMANT VIRUS

Question: My brother has come down with shingles. I realize this is not major 
news, but he never had chickenpox, and I'm positive I've been told that you're 
not supposed to be able to get shingles unless you first had chickenpox. 
</P>
<P>
Is there an explanation for this? And why does one depend on the other? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is true that a person can't have shingles (herpes zoster) without 
first having had chickenpox. In your brother's case, I can only guess that he 
must have had chickenpox, but no one realized it at the time. This would be 
possible, for example, if he had the virus but no clinical symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Once a child is infected with the varicella zoster virus, which causes both 
chickenpox and shingles, he remains infected with it. Following a case of 
chickenpox, the virus lies dormant. Why it remains latent and why it becomes 
reactivated are not known. What is known is that the incidence of shingles 
increases with age, and seldom occurs before middle age.

<P>
There's a production of "The Sound of Music" here acted entirely by people 5 to 
18 years old. The auditorium is stuffy, and you sit on a folding chair. How 
good can it be? 
</P>
<P>
Pretty darned good. 
</P>
<P>
Director Dan Halkyard has created a show with spontaneity and an admirable 
absence of chaos, considering the two large alternating casts (80 children in 
all) and the jitters of a second consecutive opening night. 
</P>
<P>
Halkyard uses the small stage smoothly, relying on a red velvet curtain and the 
talents of his young players to evoke the sweep and romance of this epic tale 
of the singing Von Trapps, who escaped the Third Reich, on foot, over the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
His players are up to the challenge. Jennifer Schlotterbeck, a high school 
freshman, is the right age to play the flibbertigibbit postulate Maria. Because 
her singing is lovely and confident, her acting warm and earnest, she is a 
winning leading lady. In Patrick Johnson as Capt. Von Trapp, she has a strong 
and handsome leading man. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Staudt as the luxury-loving Max Detweiler and Laurie O'Remus as the 
disapproving Sister Berthe both capture moments of real humor. Jannene Lowry 
does very well as the ever-wise Mother Abbess, bringing gorgeous pitch and 
plenty of power to "Climb Every Mountain," a big, daunting anthem. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, all the young people playing adults, including Dyan Hobday as heiress 
Elsa Schraeder, realize their roles admirably. They're a bit stiff as 
grown-ups, but then being grown-up is a tough act at any age. 
</P>
<P>
The kids who play kids do well too. The Von Trapp children, all seven, are 
charming. And the marionettes who show up in "The Lonely Goatherd" add a 
hilarious touch of improvisation, because you know something's always going 
happen any time you put 19 children and 40 strings together in a small space. 
The other cast looks promising just from the photos in the program. 
</P>
<P>
There are some glitches in the sound system (the show is miked with recorded 
orchestral accompaniment). But who can resist a dozen serious-faced, miniature 
nuns, even if they are only singing along with the record?

Rated A: The New York Times has accepted an ad for a movie that carries an 
adults-only rating assigned to it by its own distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Wang's "Life Is Cheap . . . But Toilet Paper Is Expensive" was rated X by 
the Motion Picture Assn. of America, but Silverlight Entertainment, arguing 
that the X creates an undue economic hardship on films, put its own "A" label 
-- for adults only -- on the ad and submitted it to the New York Times. The 
newspaper has in recent years rejected ads for X-rated movies, but has run ads 
for films that went out unrated. "Life Is Cheap" opens in New York on Aug. 24 
and in Los Angeles in September. GREG BRAXTON

Forget Martinique. If Orange County's hectic lifestyle is a gettin' you down, 
pack up the chillun and escape to Dogpatch, U.S.A., a town that moves slower 
than maple syrup a-slidin' down a stack of hot cakes. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Dogpatch comes to Brea's Curtis Theatre via "Li'l Abner," a 
"Hee-Haw"-style family musical presented by the Brea Youth Theatre under the 
direction of Gregory and Kysa Cohen. Closing performances are scheduled 
Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1956 by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, the stage version of "Li'l 
Abner" is based on Al Capp's syndicated comic strip of the same name, which 
premiered in 1934 and ran a whopping 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't changed much in Dogpatch. Daisy Mae is still mooning over Abner, 
Mammy Yokum still runs the roost and "most everybody else can still be found 
lazin' around the fishin' hole and moochin' a little moonshine." 
</P>
<P>
But, there's trouble a-brewin'. It seems the worthy Senator Phogbound has 
proclaimed Dogpatch to be the "most worthless town in the whole U.S. of A.," 
earning it the right to be blown off the map in an A-bomb test. This would be 
just fine with the residents, if it didn't interfere with the annual Sadie 
Hawkins Day race, in which members of the fairer sex (and in Dogpatch, you use 
that term loosely) nab unwilling husbands. 
</P>
<P>
The search for something -- anything -- to make Dogpatch worthwhile turns up 
Yokumberry tonic, the secret elixir that has made Abner the strapping youth he 
is. Government types whisk the boy and the brew off to Washington for extensive 
testing, setting the stage for lots of jolly jabs at Big Business and dimwitted 
politicians. (There's a not-too-subtle irony in that this "Abner" plays inside 
Brea's slick Civic and Cultural Center, just a stone's throw from the city's 
seat of power.) 
</P>
<P>
"Abner" features a 36-member cast of area youngsters, ages 8 to 17. The kids 
have varying degrees of theatrical and vocal expertise, but all put out equal 
shares of energy and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Kristyn Jenkins, 10, is the real standout as the sassy Mammy Yokum, hobbling 
madly about the stage, barking orders between puffs on her corncob pipe. Doug 
Book, 17, falls short as a singer, but his portrayal of the loveable country 
hunk Abner is larger than life. Wendy See, 15, is slim, blond and has a sweet 
soprano, making her a winsome Daisy Mae. And Roger Alan Ross, 15, is a slippery 
Marryin' Sam, a fast-talking huckster with more dee-lux wedding packages up his 
sleeve than a Vegas chapel. Eric Bleau, 14, plays Earthquake McGoon, a solid 
block wall of a man with an intellect to match. 
</P>
<P>
The opening number, "It's a Typical Day," is meant to introduce several of the 
minor roles, but the overamplified background music made it tough to make out 
the lyrics. Additionally, the program lists the cast alphabetically, instead of 
in order of appearance, making it harder to identify cast members. 
</P>
<P>
Musically speaking, however, things do improve later in the show. "Jubilation 
T. Cornpone" and "The Country's in the Very Best of Hands" are a couple of 
rousing numbers highlighted with some surprisingly tight dancing. And "Love in 
a Home" is a tender duet between Abner and Daisy Mae that shows off See's 
honeyed voice. 
</P>
<P>
Sets and lighting by Trent Nelson are serviceable and allow the large cast 
plenty of room to whoop it up on the theater's expansive stage. Annie 
McQuitty's costumes ape Capp's original drawings, down to Abner's single-strap 
overalls and Daisy's polka-dot blouse (See chose to wear hers a little more 
modestly than the comic strip's original, amply-endowed Daisy); and Senator 
Phogbound's 40-gallon Uncle Sam hat was a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
According to program director D. Scott Riordan, the Brea Youth Theatre has

'TWISTER': A KANSAS QUITE UNLIKE DOROTHY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Almereyda's "Twister" (at the Nuart) is set in a modern boozy Kansas, 
where flaky rich kids float off on a sea of alcohol and boredom. It's a movie 
with a slight buzz on: a charming, trance-like fantasy soggily alive to strange 
spasms and tics of character. 
</P>
<P>
First-time director Almereyda based this movie on Mary Robison's 1980 novel 
"Oh" -- which the writer says is about "the frailty of adulthood, the frailty 
of love. " That describes the plight of most of the central characters seem 
arrested in adolescence, especially siblings Maureen and Howdy Cleveland (Suzy 
Amis and Crispin Glover). Unwed mother Maureen, or "Mo," has the face of a 
corn-silk Botticelli with a spray of Sissy Spacek freckles. She's given to 
slouching, tantrums, petulant pouts. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Howdy is the real oddball: dressed in black with fluttery eyes and 
Renaissance bangs, he's given to cracking whips, striking Byronic poses and 
droning awful self-composed dirges that try to fuse new-wave rock with Gaelic 
poetry ("Daddy was mean" is his main theme). Howdy is an "artist" the way many 
bored, bright, lazy, self-indulgent rich kids are artists: their writing, 
painting or movies are just like his "songs." And Glover makes him a classic 
poseur-hysteric: fracturing his delivery so hilariously that every word is 
filigreed to death and every gesture is a goony ballet. In "River's Edge," 
those flailing, eccentric emphasises sometimes seemed a little forced. Here, 
they fit perfectly; it's his best performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland kids' dad, Eugene the soda pop king is played by Harry Dean 
Stanton with almost hair-raising delicacy and control: as someone so inured to 
his family -- or so soused himself -- that he's beyond amazement. He reacts to 
everything with the same crocked twinkle and amiable mellow-tone. When he 
finally throws a tantrum, it has a horrific daintiness: With quiet ferocity, he 
overturns three soup bowls and sternly tells everyone to continue eating. 
</P>
<P>
Like Dorothy, the characters including Mo's ex-lover (Dylan McDermott) and a 
bemused black maid (Charlaine Woodard) suffer through a tornado. But it doesn't 
spin them into any magic kingdom. They simply wake up dazed again, in another 
unbearably unstructured day. What Almereyda has drawn here -- with a mood that, 
except for its absence of zoom shots, irresistibly recalls the vaguely 
narcotized, real-surreal atmosphere of Robert Altman's '70s films -- is the 
dilemma of a family sunk in riches and without a clue what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
Setting the movie in Kansas -- that flat land of pale skies, with its echoes of 
both Oz and "In Cold Blood" -- heightens the surreality. It suggests the magic 
that won't come, the terror that might. When William Burroughs shows up, taking 
target practice and then ruminating on an acquaintance who shot horses and died 
after trying to eat a clock, it's a good sample of "Twister's" humor: 
ultra-deadpan, a little mean: American Gothic with glazed eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Almereyda fills every scene with verbal jolts and spins, but he doesn't have 
much visual style. The film suffers from a lack of modulation, and also from 
the low budget that keeps Almereyda from even trying for a simulated hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
But "Twister's" shortcomings can be excused, because it has something new to 
offer: a goofball penetration into the lives of the rich and tipsy, 
half-crocked under the rainbow. Seldom does a movie seem so tied to the moods 
and fluctuations of alcohol. Watching these people, you can almost imagine what 
they're drinking: from Chris' six-packs to Mo's whiskey and pills to Dad's 
bourbon to whatever Howdy is doodling himself up with: perhaps creme de menthe 
laced with Methedrine. 
</P>
<P>
"Twister" (rated PG-13) may not have special effects or taut structure, but it 
has something movies with real-looking tornadoes usually miss: intelligence, 
surprise, a flair for the craziness of the everyday.

'BEAUTY SHOP' TAKES ON A 'NEW ATTITUDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That bastion of female clubbiness, the beauty parlor, is the setting for a new 
sitcom, "New Attitude," premiering on ABC at 9:30 tonight (Channels 7, 3, 10 
and 42). 
</P>
<P>
This is an upscale, black beauty shop run with panache by two sisters, (the 
chic, sensible Sheryl Lee Ralph and the brassy, mischievous Phyllis Yvonne 
Stickney). 
</P>
<P>
Morris Day, a beautician called Lamarr, "the prince of perm," is also a 
regular, albeit looking a bit wan in this henhouse where sexual innuendo and 
Oprah Winfrey's diet top the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot episode airing tonight (followed by the first of eight regularly 
scheduled shows premiering Friday) is encumbered by an inane plot about a 
lawsuit from a customer who claims her hair turned green after a visit to the 
salon. We don't see the plaintiff, only her attorney (lame guest star Clark 
Johnson), who's ogled by the chicks under the rinse. 
</P>
<P>
The production's only hope evident here is the flavor and sass of co-stars 
Ralph (who was one of the original Broadway "Dreamgirls") and the turbaned 
Stickney, a Whoopi Goldberg-ish character with a meaner streak. 
</P>
<P>
Director Oz Scott keeps the New Attitude shop's scented captives moving to the 
show's upbeat musical theme: "I'm wearing a new dress and a new hat . . . I 
know where I'm going and what to do." The screen, with video bravado, fills 
with lascivious close-ups of wet lips. New Attitude, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The best title -- and certainly funnier show -- is the outrageously blunt 
"Beauty Shop," the current play at the Pantages Theater, which Castle Rock 
Entertainment bought, sanitized and turned into this series. Tonight's episode 
has a quartet of writing credits (Jack Elinson, Maiya Williams, Tom Straw and 
Ralph Farguhar).RAY LOYND

TWO NOT SO GENTLE VIEWS OF FIDEL CASTRO'S CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most people -- Cubans included -- Fidel Castro is Cuba. What happens when 
he dies? 
</P>
<P>
This is the overwhelming question left in the viewer's mind by both hourlong 
films that make up "Castro's Cuba: Two Views" (tonight at 9 on Channels 28 and 
15, and 8 p.m. on Channel 50). 
</P>
<P>
It emerges in Jorge Ulla's and master cinematographer Nestor Almendros' "Nobody 
Listened" from images of the bitter faces of Castro's former comrades, free 
after decades behind bars and smelling blood. It's no less clear in Saul 
Landau's "The Uncompromising Revolution," which shows Castro's aging face and 
graying beard, symbol of how the winds of global change may have passed him, 
and Cuba, by. 
</P>
<P>
Landau is an old friend of Castro's -- he always calls him "Fidel," a leftover 
from the halcyon '60s when the worldwide Left had a love affair with Cuba's 
anti-Yanqui revolution. So Landau doesn't ask his friend about death, but, 
gently, about retirement. Castro doesn't return the gentility; he rips the 
microphone off and ends the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban exiles Ulla and Almendros, had they been able to interview Castro, 
wouldn't have been so gentle. But the differences between the two films have 
been overtouted in the advance publicity: Both works show a promising national 
birth called "The New Cuba" gone corrupt. Indeed, Landau's left credentials 
allow him to get inside the country's workings far deeper than "Nobody 
Listened," and expose a Cuba in deep, internal breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
As Landau travels with Castro on a pre-arranged tour of model industries and 
institutions (a pre-arrangement that Landau lets us in on), it's clear that 
Cuba isn't working very well. Workers look bored. The lights go out in an 
optics factory just as the "commander-in-chief" arrives, and no one knows how 
to work the back-up generator. (This in a country on a crash program for 
nuclear power.) Workers building a huge medical center tell Castro that the 
winches they're using are no good; never has this master of media control 
looked so chagrined on-camera. 
</P>
<P>
All of this makes Landau wonder if Cubans can live up to Castro's dream of a 
pure communist society. Landau knows they can't until Castro, the father 
figure, the ultimate caudillo, is gone. And even then, he's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Ulla and Almendros are concerned less with Cuba's fate than with the victims of 
Cuba's own gulag archipelago of prisons and labor camps dotting the island. 
While Castro denies to Landau that any Cubans have been "disappeared," Ulla and 
Almendros document cases to the contrary. A long line of survivors of prison 
and torture testify to a barbarous system of "rehabilitation": Convicts 
unwilling to bend to the state live in feces-laden squalor. Human-rights 
activists consider Cuba an outlaw nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody Listened" is a dark contemplation of what happens when power is 
ruthlessly grasped. It is sad, but it is also crudely propagandistic in a way 
Landau's film never is. While one is an understandably angry harangue, the 
other is the disappointed letter of an ex-lover. Castro won't be pleased with 
either. ROBERT KOEHLER

HEEEEEERES JOHNNY, THE 'MAYOR OF HOLLYWOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This man strikes you as something like Leonard Zelig (see Woody Allen's 
docucomedy "Zelig"), who is always seen hanging with the near great and plenty 
great, standing about with Joe Stalin's entourage or hitting line drives with 
Lou Gehrig in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Grant is always seen hanging around Hollywood stars, wherever they 
gather, a circular little man with an ingratiating nature, a human Smiley Face. 
</P>
<P>
Now 67, the effervescing 
announcer-intreviewer-producer-host-star-gazer-hanger-on is feted in a two-hour 
special on KTLA Channel 5 tonight at 8: "The Mayor of Hollywood: Johnny Grant's 
50th Anniversary in Show Business," commencing from his kid days in Goldsboro, 
N.C., when he walked around town with a sandwich advertising board. 
</P>
<P>
Grant is vice president of public affairs for KTLA (for which he produces the 
Hollywood Christmas Parade), the "mayor of Hollywood" -- a goodwill assignment 
that sometimes takes him to distant lands -- and chairman of the Walk of Fame 
Committee, hosting the laying of new sidewalk stars around Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of cornball here but it's a kick to stroll a little down Memory 
Lane in the golden-glamour days. Although the Walk of Fame often reflects 
Hollywood at its silliest, Johnny Grant represents the glitziest of the image, 
without any of the warts. IRV LETOFSKY

SPECTACLE, COMPLETE WITH APES, IN VEGAS COURTROOM; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL RIGHTS: STARDUST HEADLINER BOBBY BEROSINI IS SUING AFTER TAPES SHOWED 
HIM HITTING HIS ORANGUTANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With performing orangutans, chorus line dancers and a few laughs, this show has 
the makings of a hit on the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe a TV soap opera, given 
the accusations of abuse, tearful denials and tales of intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
But the stage for this show is the Clark County courthouse, a few miles off the 
famed Strip. A proceeding known here as "The Monkey Trial" has tantalized Las 
Vegas for four weeks with an inside look at the backstage politics of floor 
shows on the Strip and what some say is a raw display of special treatment for 
stars here. 
</P>
<P>
When its run ends, the trial's most sweeping result could be to force animal 
protection activists around the country to scale back their aggressive tactics 
in pursuit of suspected animal abusers. 
</P>
<P>
"If they make this stick, no Humane Society or ASPCA (American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) can ever investigate a report of animal 
abuse," said Philip Hirschkop, a Virginia attorney for People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals, (PETA) a Washington-based group. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, a video camera hidden backstage at the Stardust hotel-casino 
recorded headliner Bobby Berosini hitting his orangutans across the back with a 
rod while handlers held the apes' hands. The treatment is repeated on tape 
several nights, moments before Berosini and his apes take the stage for their 
act of gags and tricks during the Lido de Paris floor show. 
</P>
<P>
An animal rights organization got hold of the tape and sent copies to primate 
experts around the world. Most, including famed researcher Jane Goodall, 
complained that it depicted gross abuse. The tape and the charges found their 
way onto national television, first on "Entertainment Tonight," then on the 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
Berosini, who contends that he was only "correcting" his reddish-brown, 
waist-high apes, is suing for slander and invasion of privacy, and seeking $80 
million in damages. This is no ordinary lawsuit, however, even by Las Vegas 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The jury has been sequestered each night in the Golden Nugget hotel-casino 
across the street -- a highly unusual step for a non-criminal proceeding. But 
then, most civil lawsuits take years to come to trial here. This one got to 
court in 11 months. The trial also convenes evenings and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Pitaro, Berosini's lead attorney, only smiles and shrugs when asked how 
the trial came to be expedited. But in Las Vegas, Berosini is a star. His name 
in lights towers over the Strip outside the Stardust. Since 1984, the 
performing orangutans have been a twice-a-night mainstay of the Lido de Paris, 
a spectacle of chorus numbers and topless dancers that the Stardust advertises 
as "The Show That Made Las Vegas Famous." 
</P>
<P>
The defendants -- PETA, local activists and ex-Stardust dancers -- have a more 
conspiratorial view. They say that Las Vegas has closed ranks around Berosini 
to protect abusive animal acts in the Strip's hotel-casinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevada's a very political state, more than any I've ever litigated in," 
Hirschkop said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have sought a mistrial more than 20 times, claiming numerous 
mistakes and favoritism toward Berosini by the judge -- beginning with the 
trial's opening act. When the jury was first seated, Berosini was allowed to 
bring in the orangutans and give a short performance. Jurors were enraptured by 
the mugging apes with the big eyes, outraged defense lawyers said, making it 
hard for them to objectively view testimony that Berosini mistreats the 
orangutans. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, Myron Leavitt, was Nevada's lieutenant governor from 1979-82. The 
defense sought to have Leavitt disqualified because he is a former roommate and 
law partner of William Boyd, one of the Stardust owners, and received a $25,000 
campaign contribution from the Stardust for an unsuccessful try for election to 
the Nevada Supreme Court. Leavitt ruled there was no conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was totally improper for the judge to not disqualify himself," 
Hirschkop said in an interview. "I feel he has shown bias." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after Leavitt ruled that more than 15 defense witnesses -- including 
key experts on animal abuse -- would not be allowed to testify for procedural 
reasons, activists who are observing the trial reacted bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia is a pretty open society now. Why can't Las Vegas be?" said Cleveland 
Amory, animal rights activist and president of the New York-based Fund for 
Animals. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has been played out before local TV news cameras and, on especially 
good days, a courtroom full of spectators. They have heard Berosini labeled 
"worse than a child abuser," and Hirschkop called a communist by the 
entertainer. One defendant, a local animal rights activist, also complained 
that one of Berosini's attorneys was having a relationship with her sister. 
More than once the judge has threatened fines for courtroom behavior. 
</P>
<P>
For the four days that Berosini testified, the courtroom was treated to 
laughter and copious tears. A native of Czechoslovakia whose father and son 
also have performed in Las Vegas, Berosini said he has lost a TV show and other 
work in the entertainment field because no one wants to touch him -- though his 
show continues at the Stardust. 
</P>
<P>
When the tape became public, the Stardust received more than 1,000 out-of-state 
phone calls of protest. "I was in shock, sir. I was in bad shape," Berosini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The orangutans are not abused, he declared. "The animals are not beaten," 
Berosini testified. "I corrected those animals." 
</P>
<P>
He blames the trouble on disgruntled dancers who are unhappy that he has the 
power to have dancers fired at the Stardust, and on zealots who want the power 
to keep animals out of Las Vegas shows. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't about animals," Joan Berosini, his wife and former stage partner, 
said outside court one afternoon. "It's about power. They don't even like 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
PETA said its investigators found that the orangutans cower in terror in 
Berosini's presence and often urinate at the sight of him. A veterinarian found 
physical evidence of abuse. The apes are kept isolated in dark, metal boxes -- 
rather than outside in cages or wooded compounds, as in zoos -- to intensify 
their emotional reliance on Berosini, the group contends. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Berosini lost his federal permit to breed and obtain new 
orangutans, in part because of the living conditions on the bus where he keeps 
the orangutans. Laws require cages of 22 square feet per animal, and he 
provides about 7 1/2 feet. The government also cited Berosini's failure to 
breed the Sumatran apes, a requirement of the permit allowing him to keep an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Berosini, in turn, says the apes could not perform if they were abused, and in 
court he sparred with attorney Dan Foley over the need for more space. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't lay like people, Mr. Foley," Berosini said. "They have very short 
legs. They put their legs on their stomach and hold them with their hands. They 
are very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The apes watch television to relieve their boredom, Berosini said. He conceded 
that none of his orangutans have been bred, but he denied charges by activists 
that his breeding program is a sham to let him keep the animals. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Berosini said, he tried to match Tiga, his 24-year-old 
female, with Rusty, a 17-year-old male, but they weren't compatible. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, she used to beat him up," Berosini testified. "Tiga is a lovable 
animal, but for some reason she didn't like Rusty." 
</P>
<P>
When Foley pressed for details on the stage gags performed by the apes -- 
especially one in which they raise a single finger to the audience -- Berosini 
broke up the courtroom in laughter with his rejoinder: "Mr. Foley, I'll give 
you a demonstration of how to give the finger if you want." 
</P>
<P>
Berosini has been unable to clear up a key point of contention: What was the 
object he was using to hit the apes? Activists and dancers contend that it was 
a steel reinforcing bar. Berosini said it was a wooden baton that was lost 
before he could produce it as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
During the defense's case, which began last week and ended abruptly early this 
week, there was testimony about Berosini's jealousy when country singer Dottie 
West got his dressing room -- the one with the private bathroom -- and about 
dancers who lost their jobs for crossing Berosini. In one episode, Berosini's 
displeasure with new hats worn by the dancers ended in a fight and a battery 
charge against the entertainer, which has been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants put witnesses on the stand -- including actress Rue McClanahan, 
a PETA member, and music personality Casey Kasem -- to challenge the contention 
that Berosini has lost work. The main defense point is that activists cannot be 
held liable for making what they consider to be truthful charges. 
</P>
<P>
The hidden videotape was made by a former Lido de Paris dancer, Ottavio 
Gesmundo, who said he and other dancers suspected abuse of the orangutans but 
could never prove it. A condition of their job was that they stay away from the 
curtained-off area where Berosini prepares the animals. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, Gesmundo said, after he was informed that he was not to be 
rehired, he hid the camera where it could tape Berosini. Every night after the 
taping, while Berosini was on stage, the Lido dancers would gather in their 
dressing room to watch the tape. "We couldn't believe what we were seeing," 
dancer Russell Martin testified. 
</P>
<P>
Gesmundo sent copies to PETA, which quietly conducted an investigation, the 
group's officials said. The tape was released to "Entertainment Tonight" via 
another defendant, the California-based Performing Animal Welfare Society, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
PETA officials said that when they received the tape, they sent it to 20 
experts on primate behavior. Several responded with notarized letters 
condemning the treatment seen on the tape, PETA officials said.

Goodall wrote from England that she was "shocked, sickened -- and saddened" by 
what she described as entirely unprovoked assaults.

"I sincerely believe that these orangs should be confiscated immediately and 
placed in the hands of caring and responsible people (and those responsible) 
should never be allowed to own, train or handle animals again," said Goodall,

WAR PLANNERS SKETCH STRATEGY FOR DESERT FIGHT 
</P>

<P>
President Bush's plan for blocking an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia combines a 
deployment of American ground troops with sophisticated air and naval weaponry 
designed to shatter advancing armored columns in the desert wastes of the 
world's richest oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they were unable to match an Iraqi invasion force tank for tank and man 
for man, U.S. military forces would seek to dominate the battle from the skies, 
raining down Maverick missiles and explosive mines on Iraqi tanks and infantry. 
</P>
<P>
As sketched by U.S. military planners, a modern desert war would see 
sophisticated fighters capitalizing on air superiority while naval guns bombard 
a strategic coastal road and paratroopers dig in at crucial choke-points to 
erect anti-tank defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Such a battle would be costly to both sides. But, while it would be unlikely to 
send Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his forces fleeing, it at least would 
"soak up" Iraq's onslaught and "probably stop" any Hussein advance, a senior 
military official said. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of such a conflict -- involving some of the most elite troops and 
warplanes that the United States can muster -- provides at last what American 
officials say is a credible deterrent that makes it clear any Iraqi land grab 
would be met with significant force. 
</P>
<P>
But with Iraq's 1-million-man army dominating the region, there still is major 
uncertainty about Hussein's intentions. Although the increased air power might 
protect Saudi Arabian soil, experts said, it offers no hope of forcing the 
enemy to roll back from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important step, but it don't get Kuwait back," Michael Dunn, a 
Washington-based military consultant, said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, military planners said Tuesday that the single most important facet of 
the U.S. intervention may be the actual presence of Americans on the ground -- 
an unmistakable tripwire that virtually guarantees that any new Iraqi foray 
would bring the United States to war. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that with Tuesday's troop deployments, America's once-vague threat 
of retribution had now been rendered immediate and vivid. The airborne weapons 
Bush sent to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday can halt even the most well-armored tank. 
</P>
<P>
"Deterrence means control of the other side's state of mind -- and this is 
bound to get Hussein's attention," retired Navy Adm. Thomas Moorer said. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force experts said that with access to Saudi air bases, which has now been 
granted, U.S. warplanes could stall and exact heavy losses on any Iraqi ground 
attack -- even a blitzkrieg that sent hundreds of tanks thundering down the 
highway toward the Saudi oil port of Dhahran. 
</P>
<P>
Under a scenario described by several military sources, such an attack would be 
scouted out in advance by high-flying TR-1 spy planes and blunted from its 
outset by super-secret Navy EA-6B Prowlers, whose electronic arsenal could 
confound enemy communications. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Air Force planes and Navy vessels in the Persian Gulf would 
bombard the coastal roadway, forcing Iraqi columns into the sand. Tank-killing 
F-16s and AH-64 Apache helicopters would join in the attack, firing Maverick 
and Hellfire missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Any Iraqi breakdown would quickly be compounded as tanks bogged down in traffic 
and became more vulnerable to airborne raids. 
</P>
<P>
"That terrain is very hard to hide tanks in," one Pentagon war-planner said. 
"They would look like a fleet of ships floating out in a big, featureless 
desert." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, American and Saudi ground forces, dug in at crucial points 
and armed with thousands of antitank weapons, would fire additional salvos at 
the narrow spaces where increasingly unfriendly Saudi Arabian terrain would 
force the tanks into a single file. 
</P>
<P>
"You could delay them, you could stop them, you could hurt them badly," said 
Benjamin Lambeth, a former combat fighter pilot who is now a RAND Corp. 
consultant and expert on tactical air forces. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're dealing with is a situation in which U.S. air assets would be used 
as a spoiling factor, with a view to making any such operations prohibitively 
costly," Lambeth added. "And the sooner you have them there, the easier it is 
to do this." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Pentagon planners caution that military operations are inherently 
uncertain, and often even the best-laid plans do not work out. Moreover, they 
concede that U.S. forces have little experience in desert warfare, particularly 
against troops like the war-hardened Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, strategists say that the size and type of the force that the 
President has ordered deployed makes the prospect that the mission might 
succeed a credible threat to Iraqi commanders -- and that in itself may be 
sufficient to forestall any new attack. 
</P>
<P>
The optimistic scenario envisions U.S. aircraft quickly assuming control of the 
skies, leaving American fighters and helicopters free to strafe oncoming 
armored forces without fear of being blindsided from the air. 
</P>
<P>
In such early dogfights, early-warning radar surveillance planes operated by 
Saudi forces would play a crucial role in managing the battle from the air. But 
experts warned that despite the presence of the AWACS planes, the air battle 
still might bring heavy casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Top-of-the-line Air Force fighters, such as F-15s and older F-111s, would joust 
with advanced Soviet-made MIG-23s, flown by Iraqi pilots whose skill and 
experience makes them among the most feared flyers in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
And even if the American forces prevailed aloft, they would still have to 
contend with French-made Mirages and tank-protecting Iraqi aircraft called 
Su-25 "Frogfoots." Among the planes that the Frogfoots would have to face: RF-4 
reconnaissance/attack planes that the Air Force calls Wild Weasels. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a fight that we're looking for," one Pentagon planner said. "But 
those forces are ready to go to war today." 
</P>
<P>
If the defensive effort foundered -- or perhaps even if it did not -- American 
forces might well respond by widening the battlefield and striking deep into 
Iraqi territory at supply depots and airfields, the military analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the weapons that might be brought to bear: A-6 Intruders and A-7 Corsairs 
from American carriers, F-111s based in Turkey or even long-range B-52s now 
believed to be in the Indian Ocean -- any of which could attack behind Iraqi 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
But the more likely assault would come from Tomahawk cruise missiles, armed 
with conventional explosives and launched from Navy vessels from as far as 
1,600 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that we would blow the hell out of every airfield 
in Iraq," said one retired Army general, who insisted on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has one of the best air defense networks in the world, military analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Added Moorer, the retired Navy admiral: "This is all just part of deterrence, 
to make Hussein stop and think."

BROWN ASSAILS INITIATIVE TO LIMIT TERMS IN OFFICE

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown aimed his rhetorical guns at Pete Schabarum's 
term limits initiative Tuesday, accusing the Los Angeles County supervisor of a 
"mean-spirited" attempt to return the state to an era when big-money corporate 
lobbyists controlled the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said legendary lobbyist Artie Samish -- made famous in a photograph in 
which he held a puppet "legislator" on his arm -- could have written the 
measure himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The sleazy, coldblooded special interests are going to see an opportunity and 
they're going to be supporting Schabarum because, believe me, they will 
dominate," Brown, a San Francisco Democrat, told reporters at a Capitol press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, Proposition 140 on the November ballot, would limit Assembly 
members to three terms and state senators and statewide officers, including the 
governor, to two terms. It also would sharply reduce what the Legislature could 
spend on its staff and operations and would eliminate the Legislature's 
taxpayer-financed retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure, Proposition 131, sponsored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, 
would limit state legislators to 12 successive years in one office -- six terms 
for the Assembly or three in the Senate. The Van de Kamp initiative also would 
limit statewide elected officials to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, a Republican, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But Mike 
Lewis, a spokesman for the Proposition 140 campaign, denied Brown's charge that 
the initiative would increase the power of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a little silly to suggest that the Legislature could be any more 
dominated by interests than it is today," Lewis said. "There is going to be 
fresh blood, a rotation of the seats. Limited terms is going to improve the 
function and process and the results that the Legislature achieves." 
</P>
<P>
Brown last spring helped raise more than $5 million -- much of it from the very 
special interests he often attacks -- to defeat Propositions 118 and 119, two 
ballot measures that would have limited the power of lawmakers to draw their 
own district lines. The Speaker hinted Tuesday that a similar campaign is in 
the works to defeat Propositions 131 and 140, beginning with a fund-raiser 
Sept. 13 at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Brown focused his ire on Proposition 140, which he has said he considers a 
personal attack on his leadership of the Assembly. "This is a mean-spirited 
effort," Brown said. "When addressed appropriately, it will be rejected by the 
voters of this state." 
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative's provision to cut the Legislature's budget by more than 
one-third would deprive lawmakers of their professional analysts and in turn 
make them more dependent on lobbyists for their information. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbying corps would be given a further advantage by the initiative because 
the term limits would force lawmakers out of office just as they were gaining 
the expertise to be effective, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only time that anyone is suggesting that experience is a 
liability," said Brown, who is in his 13th term in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Brown asked: "Would you prefer to be administered for your brain tumor by the 
surgeon who graduates this year or by the surgeon who has been practicing for 
10 years and never lost a patient? There is no question which one you'd prefer 
to . . . do a number on your brain tumor."

METABOLISM, WEIGHT-GAIN LINK REFUTED;

RESEARCH: DIETERS' ABILITY TO BURN OFF CALORIES BOUNCES BACK, A STUDY FINDS. 
BUT WEIGHT LOSS IS STILL DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN FOR REASONS THAT ARE POORLY 
UNDERSTOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The fear that diets ultimately fail because the dieter's metabolism becomes 
abnormally sluggish appears to be unfounded, researchers report in today's 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But, they said, long-term weight loss is still very difficult to maintain for 
reasons that are poorly understood. The findings are similar to those reported 
recently by a USC researcher. 
</P>
<P>
Experts previously assumed that a drop in weight triggered a permanent, 
corresponding drop in resting metabolic rate, the amount of energy the body 
requires at rest to maintain basic physiological functions such as heart rate 
and respiration. A permanently lowered resting metabolic rate would mean that a 
dieter would not burn calories as rapidly and might regain weight or have 
trouble shedding more pounds. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new studies at the University of Pennsylvania show that when 
overweight women who also exercised were taken off a very-low-calorie diet, 
their metabolism bounced back to a level that is normal for their new, lower 
body weight. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are important for individuals attempting medically supervised 
dieting. Some experts feared that very-low-calorie diets -- such as liquid 
diets -- put the body into a starvation mode, slowing metabolism to a rate that 
thwarted significant weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically at least, dieting can work, but researchers still don't 
understand why it is so hard for many people to permanently keep the weight 
off, said Thomas A. Wadden, associate professor of psychology at the University 
of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistics tell us that it is extremely difficult to keep weight off; people 
will still have to work very hard at this despite our favorable metabolic 
findings," Wadden said. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that extreme dieting triggers a plunge in metabolic rate. 
But how the change in metabolic rate affects long-term weight control has been 
the subject of much research and debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have long known that when people diet, metabolic rate falls sharply. And 
the more you cut back your calories, the more your metabolic rate falls," 
Wadden said. "But does it ever come back up or does it stay down? That is what 
we were trying to assess." 
</P>
<P>
The study followed 18 women weighing an average of 216 pounds for 48 weeks. 
Nine of the women received a conventional diet of 1,200 calories a day for 48 
weeks. The other nine were placed on the very-low-caloried liquid-formula diet 
Optifast for 16 weeks, followed by a conventional reducing diet. All the women 
increased their physical activity by walking. 
</P>
<P>
After five weeks, the resting metabolic rate dropped in both groups, most 
significantly in the very-low-calorie dieters. But metabolic rate rose again in 
both groups. After 48 weeks, metabolic rates of both groups were about 9% lower 
than at the start of the study and weight had been reduced by 16% to 19%. 
</P>
<P>
"After people lost 40 or 50 pounds, their metabolic rate is lower than it was 
before. That reduction in metabolic rate has to be anticipated; it takes less 
fuel to keep a lighter body going than a heavier body," Wadden said. 
</P>
<P>
"What they don't have is a long-term suppression of the metabolic rate due to 
the effects of dieting. Over the long term, the metabolic rate increases to a 
level that is appropriate for your new, reduced body weight." 
</P>
<P>
The results mirror a similar study performed at USC by Dr. Ken Fujioka, now a 
San Diego-based researcher. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of obese women placed on a 650-calorie diet for 10 weeks, Fujioka 
found that the dieters' metabolic rates fell in proportion to their weight 
loss. Wadden's finding that even diets of 420 calories do not trigger long-term 
metabolic suppression is significant, Fujioka said. 
</P>
<P>
"The question was, how many calories can you go down and not permanently lower 
metabolic rate? I'm surprised at that number (420 calories)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the metabolic rate was lower than before dieting, however, the dieters 
still needed to consume fewer calories to maintain their weight loss, Wadden 
said. Generally, for each 25 pounds lost, a dieter should cut back 100 calories 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
Wadden also noted that the women in the study also exercised -- a factor that 
might be very important in boosting metabolic rate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to exercise while you're dieting," he said. "The exercise 
preserves your muscle tissue, and the more muscle tissue you have, the higher 
your metabolic rate. Moreover, we know that exercise is the single known 
predictor of long-term weight loss." 
</P>
<P>
In a related study published earlier this year, Stanford researchers found that 
men who dieted but did not exercise experienced a suppressed metabolic rate. 
But overweight men who lost weight through exercise, but did not diet, 
experienced no reduction in metabolic rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always held that it would be better for overweight people to increase 
exercise than to rely totally on extremely low-calorie diets," said Peter Wood 
of Stanford. "Exercise is less likely to have this permanent effect on the 
resting metabolic rate, which makes it easier for people to maintain their 
weight in the future." 
</P>
<P>
But, Wadden said, researchers have few other clues on how to maintain long-term 
weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid we can't say you can lose weight and never regain it."

FUNERAL FOR SLAIN ISRAELI YOUTHS SPARKS VIOLENCE; ARAB KILLED

<P>
Thousands of angry young Israelis stormed through Jerusalem on Tuesday, hurling 
stones at Arab cars and roughing up the occupants, after a funeral for two 
Israeli youths who were brutally killed. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, the former defense minister, called for the 
immediate expulsion of the entire Palestinian leadership, which he said would 
put an end to the intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
Several injuries and arrests were reported as the police tried to quell the 
disturbance that erupted after the funeral. And earlier in the day, a 
Palestinian woman was shot to death near the West Bank city of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
The rampaging crowds chanted "Death to Arabs" and "Death to left-wingers," a 
reference to Israeli supporters of the Palestinian cause. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, many of the young men racing through the streets wore masks 
similar to those worn by Palestinian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Teddy Kollek called for calm, declaring: "Violence and danger are a way 
of life. These are problems we have to live with." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's two chief rabbis, Avraham Shapira of the Ashkenazic community and 
Mordechai Eliahu of the Sephardic community, called on Israelis to refrain from 
"acts of revenge." Both urged Arab leaders to denounce the crime. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident in Hebron, crowds injured two Pakistani tourists, police said. 
In others, doors were ripped off cars and passengers were pulled out into the 
street and pummeled. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli television crews, blamed for announcing the names of the victims before 
their families had been notified, were also attacked. 
</P>
<P>
The two dead youths were Ronen Karamani, 18, and his friend, Lior Tubul, 17. 
They were last seen alive Saturday night as they left to visit girlfriends 
north of Jerusalem. Their bodies were found Monday afternoon in a ravine, 
bound, gagged, stabbed and bludgeoned. 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic acts of violence continued through Monday night. The most serious was 
the fatal shooting of the Palestinian woman, Aziza Salem Jaber, 25, as she 
drove past the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, taking her pregnant 
sister-in-law to a Hebron hospital.

COLOMBIA'S NEW LEADER SAYS HE'LL PACIFY NATION; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA: GAVIRIA TAKES OFFICE WITH A TOUGH POSITION AGAINST THE MEDELLIN 
DRUG CARTEL. 
</P>

BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cesar Gaviria, 43, took office Tuesday as president of Colombia and vowed in an 
ambitious inaugural speech to pacify his violence-torn South American country. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria took a tough position against "narco-terrorism," ruthless bombings and 
shootings by the notorious Medellin cartel of cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Narco-terrorism is the principal threat against our democracy," he said. "We 
will face it without concessions." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign officials attending the inauguration ceremony, which took place in a 
plaza between the Congress building and the presidential palace, included three 
South American presidents and Vice President Dan Quayle. Police and soldiers 
cordoned off a large area around the plaza, and armed helicopters hovered 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The extreme security measures reflected fear of an attack by drug traffickers, 
and so did Gaviria in his speech, recalling the assassinations of three 
presidential candidates in the campaign that ended with his election May 27. 
Police have blamed the Medellin drug cartel for all three slayings. 
</P>
<P>
"No nation in the history of humanity," Gaviria said, "has paid as high a price 
as Colombia . . . for confronting the most powerful criminal organizations in 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
He did not refer to a truce that has silenced narco-terrorist bombs and guns 
since July 28, but he had said earlier that it was good news. The traffickers 
have called for an end to the government policy of extraditing Colombians for 
trial in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria said Tuesday that extradition is a "discretionary" tool, but for the 
government to exercise true discretion, "it is first required that the terror 
disappear and that we have a strengthened judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to leave the door open for a tacit peace arrangement that would 
offer traffickers the alternative of trial in Colombia rather than extradition 
-- if the narco-terrorism ends and if Colombia's courts, made impotent by 
intimidation and bribes, can be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria promised deep reforms in the criminal justice system and special 
protection for judges. 
</P>
<P>
Without effective justice for traffickers in Colombia, the outgoing 
administration of President Virgilio Barco Vargas has in the past year 
extradited 22 accused traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, after meeting with Gaviria, was asked by a Colombian journalist if the 
United States would halt its economic aid to Colombia if the new administration 
stopped extraditing suspected drug dealers to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle did not respond directly but said: "We anticipate the extradition will 
go forward, and we think it will. I have no reason to believe that it will 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria's pacification proposals also include dismantling death squads, which 
have killed thousands of suspected guerrilla sympathizers and other leftists, 
and following through on the Barco administration's peace negotiations with 
guerrilla organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the April 19 Movement, or M-19, laid down their arms last March 
and joined in the presidential campaign. Three other guerrilla groups also have 
entered peace talks, but two others continue to fight the government. 
</P>
<P>
On April 26 a gunman killed Carlos Pizarro, the M-19 presidential candidate. 
Antonio Navarro continued the race as the M-19 candidate and finished third 
with 12% of the vote.

UNREST NOT OVER YET, SOUTH AFRICANS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
RACIAL STRIFE: BOTH LEFT-WING BLACKS AND RIGHT-WING WHITES ARE CRITICAL OF 
ANC-GOVERNMENT ACCORD.

<P>
The suspension of the African National Congress' 30-year-old guerrilla war was 
warmly welcomed here Tuesday as an important symbolic breakthrough for hopes of 
racial reconciliation, but political analysts said it will not be enough to 
douse the unrest immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Andre du Toit, a professor of political studies at the University of Cape Town, 
said, "I'm not sure how long it will take for what was decided in Pretoria to 
percolate and make a difference in Crossroads (a scene of recent unrest near 
Cape Town), but I certainly don't think it will happen tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The police found the bodies of two gunshot victims Tuesday in the black 
township of Sebokeng, the scene of factional fighting about 30 miles south of 
Johannesburg. And a day earlier, as the ANC and the government were meeting, 
more than a dozen people were killed in township clashes west of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's agreement on ending military action, announced early Tuesday after 14 
hours of talks with the government, was received favorably for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm deeply thrilled . . . in the seventh heaven of delight," Anglican 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner and 
anti-apartheid campaigner, had been criticized by the ANC in the past for 
refusing to endorse its armed campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The government expressed hope that constitutional negotiations could begin 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the accord was sharply criticized by left-wing blacks as well as right-wing 
whites, two groups the government and the ANC need to bring to the negotiating 
table for talks on a new constitution. The government says it is prepared to 
grant the black majority voting rights and to dismantle remaining apartheid 
legislation that makes for segregated neighborhoods and schools. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC characterized the suspension of its armed struggle as a major 
concession, pointing out that the government had not yet fully met its 
pre-negotiation demands. 
</P>
<P>
For example, although the accord outlines a procedure for identifying and 
releasing political prisoners, one of the ANC's central demands, the first of 
those prisoners will not be freed until Sept. 1. And indemnity for tens of 
thousands of exiles will not be granted until after Oct. 1 under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest, which can be traced to a variety of factors, has escalated sharply 
since the ban on the ANC and other anti-apartheid organizations was lifted Feb. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting between supporters of Nelson Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Gatsha 
Buthelezi's Inkatha organization, which has claimed about 3,000 lives in the 
last three years in Natal province, has in recent weeks spread to 
Johannesburg-area townships. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 years of ideological disagreement between the ANC and its leftist 
rival, the Pan-Africanist Congress, has also triggered violence in some 
townships. Although the two organizations have tried to stop these outbreaks, 
the PAC still accuses the ANC of selling out for negotiating with the 
government, and it is gaining support among young radicals who agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the ANC has become part of the negotiating process, it is clearly 
going to be more vulnerable to charges that it is compromising and 
collaborating," Du Toit, the Cape Town professor, said. 
</P>
<P>
The PAC refused Tuesday to relinquish its own, smaller military effort until 
the government agrees to a redistribution of the country's wealth and the 
election of a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
PAC leader Zeph Mothopeng said his organization "is not bound by (the ANC) 
decision," adding: "We have no option but to remain committed to the 
continuation and intensification of the struggle on all fronts and in all 
forms." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's armed struggle, directed by commanders of the 6,000-man Umkhonto we 
Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), has been largely dormant for nearly a year. 
Although bombs have been set off periodically across the country this year, 
most appear to have been the work of small groups of radical left-wing blacks 
or right-wing whites. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the number of acts of terror committed by the ANC fell from a high 
of 281 in 1988 to only 32 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party, the government's right-wing white opposition in 
Parliament, scoffed at the ANC-government agreement Tuesday, saying the ANC was 
interested only in "a surrender of power or a seizure of power." Again, the 
party refused to take part in talks. 
</P>
<P>
"If the talks are about negotiating ourselves out of political power and out of 
our own land, then you won't find us there at the table," Conservative leader 
Andries Treurnicht said. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has said it is committed to the peace process, but it warned Tuesday 
that the military wing would remain in place -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using the word 'suspension' deliberately but we are hoping there will be 
no need to resume (the armed struggle)," ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Slovo, another member of the ANC's five-man negotiating team, said, "There 
is nothing in the law to make it a crime to operate secretly." 
</P>
<P>
Both the ANC and its ally, the South African Communist Party, have carried out 
some secret operations. But Slovo said "there will be no further infiltration 
of combat formations and of weapons into the country."

Prince Johnson, one of two rebel leaders besieging the capital of Liberia, 
threatened Tuesday to attack a detachment of U.S. Marines unless the United 
States or another foreign country intervenes to halt the Liberian civil war. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a group of West African countries announced that they will 
send a joint military force into Liberia in an effort to end the conflict and 
set up an interim government. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication of when the multilateral force will be organized. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of West African intervention came at the end of a two-day 
meeting in Banjul, Gambia, attended by the leaders of Guinea and Sierra Leone, 
which border on Liberia, and Ghana and Nigeria, which have had close ties with 
Liberia. Many Ghanaian and Nigerian citizens work and do business there. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson issued his threat against the Marines, which was interpreted as an 
attempt to provoke foreign intervention, at a news conference in Monrovia, the 
Liberian capital, where he and a rival rebel leader are trying to oust the 
government of President Samuel K. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 Marines were put ashore at Monrovia on Sunday to oversee the 
evacuation of U.S. and other foreign nationals wishing to leave the war-torn 
capital. The Marines are under orders not to get involved in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference in Monrovia, Johnson presented eight of the foreigners 
seized Monday at the Hotel Africa on the outskirts of Monrovia, including an 
American identified as Chris Mendes, 27, a mining engineer from Sacramento. The 
others were three Britons, two Germans, a Dutchman and an Argentine. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has pledged not to harm them but said he would hold them until an 
outside force arrived to settle the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
There was some question about the total number of hostages. U.S. officials in 
Washington put the figure at 14 or 15, but in London the British Foreign Office 
said it was 16. Late Tuesday, the Associated Press reported more had been 
taken, raising the number to 22. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also announced that he had executed a Liberian senator, Fred J. Blay, 
for espionage on Sunday and is planning to shoot Congressman William Jabrah on 
the same charge. Jabrah was brought to the news conference with his hands 
bound. 
</P>
<P>
Also present at the West Africa meeting was Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim 
of the Organization of African Unity. The OAU charter prohibits African 
countries from interfering in one another's internal affairs, but in this case 
the OAU has endorsed the move. 
</P>
<P>
The West African force reportedly will be commanded by a Ghanaian officer with 
a Guinean deputy. Nigeria, the dominant military and economic power in West 
Africa, is expected to provide most of the troops. 
</P>
<P>
President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria has been friendly toward President 
Samuel K. Doe of Liberia, and this has caused concern that a Nigerian-led force 
might not have the credibility needed to disarm the two rebel groups and 
instill confidence in the Liberian people that Doe will go. 
</P>
<P>
The West African task force, according to sources reporting from Banjul, will 
consist of troops from Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia as well as 
Nigeria. It will include an overland party setting out from Sierra Leone, which 
is situated on Liberia's western border, and a largely Nigerian naval party. 
</P>
<P>
For a brief time Tuesday, it appeared that the intervention would have the 
support of all three warring parties in Monrovia: Doe, Johnson and Charles 
Taylor, leader of the larger rebel group, the so-called National Patriotic 
Front. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor spokesman Tom Woewiyu indicated in Banjul before the summit meeting that 
he might support the intervention if he were satisfied that its mission would 
be only to police a cease-fire. But on leaving the meeting, he said, "We do not 
think military intervention will solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The West African task force would be one of a very short list of military 
interventions in African countries since the period of independence after World 
War II. In 1981, the OAU made an abortive attempt with 5,000 men from Nigeria 
and Zaire to impose a cease-fire between the government and rebels in Chad. 
They failed to enforce the cease-fire and withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Tanzania's President Julius K. Nyerere sent troops into Uganda to oust 
President Idi Amin and install Milton Obote for his second term as leader of 
Uganda. But by then Ugandan forces had invaded Tanzania and bombed a border 
town. As it happened, Obote's second term proved even more repressive and 
violent than Amin's reign, and he was deposed in 1985 by Lt. Col. Tito Okello, 
who was overthrown the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The West African leaders who met in Banjul under the auspices of the 16-nation 
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which is modeled on the 
European Community, said in a communique that "the sole purpose of the . . . 
peacekeeping force is to create the necessary conditions for normal life to 
resume to the benefit of all Liberians." 
</P>
<P>
The Liberian civil war began last Christmas Eve when Taylor, a former member of 
Doe's Cabinet who fell out with the president and later received arms and 
training from Libya, invaded from Ivory Coast with 200 men. 
</P>
<P>
Since reaching Monrovia, Taylor has declared himself head of an interim 
government, but has given no indication that he plans to restore democratic 
rule. The West African task force, if successful, would bar him from power 
along with Johnson and Doe.

East German unemployment nearly doubled in July to 272,000 people, underscoring 
the need for unification with West Germany to rescue the former Communist 
country's crumbling economy, labor officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Office said that unemployment soared 90% last month to 272,000, with 
another 847,000 people working or registered for "short time," a state-funded 
limbo between joblessness and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Labor officials tried to play down the gravity of Tuesday's data, saying it was 
wrong to assume that all workers registered for short time were in fact 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"My rough estimate, made from spot checks with firms, is that only half are not 
working at all," said Horst Kinitz, state secretary in the Labor Ministry. He 
also said that more than 6,000 companies were on short time, affecting 
agriculture, textiles and electronics firms. 
</P>
<P>
Economic union between the two Germanys July 1 was supposed to open East 
Germany to Western investment, providing more jobs for the 8.4-million work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's unemployment rate in July was still just 3.1%, well below the 7% 
in West Germany.

A previously unknown faction calling itself the Palestine Revolutionary Squads 
said it will release two Swiss hostages of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross within 24 hours. The statement, handwritten in Arabic, was delivered 
to the independent Beirut newspaper An Nahar along with a photograph of Swiss 
captive Emmanuel Christen, 32. He and the other hostage, Elio Erriquez, 23, 
were kidnaped Oct. 6, 1989, in Sidon.

Hurricane Diana battered Mexico's Gulf Coast with 85-m.p.h winds Tuesday, 
toppling trees and electricity poles in Poza Rica, 25 miles inland, federal 
highway police said. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross spokesman Moises Gutierrez Pina said by telephone that at least one 
person was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents fled low-lying areas before Diana hit. 
</P>
<P>
The eye of the storm was over Tuxpan, on the coast 180 miles northeast of 
Mexico City, at 4:45 p.m. EDT, the U.S. National Weather Service near Miami 
said. By 6 p.m. EDT , the center of the storm, with winds at 75 m.p.h., was 20 
miles west of Tuxpan, moving west at about 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Maria Ahuja, a spokeswoman for the state government, said Diana had 
affected 14 towns at the foot of the eastern Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines to Tuxpan were out. The Red Cross and highway police in Poza 
Rica, on higher ground 30 miles southwest of Tuxpan, said they had no radio 
contact with the coastal town. 
</P>
<P>
Small craft were warned to remain in port from Baffin Bay, Texas, southward. 
</P>
<P>
Rainfall of 10 inches or more was expected along Diana's path.

The California Legislature was told Tuesday that although the state imports no 
crude oil from the Middle East, it is hardly immune to the economic 
consequences of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Iraq and Kuwait produce 8% of the world's total oil supply -- and if 
this amount is not available, "that's a heck of a big shock to the worldwide 
market," state Energy Commission member Richard A. Bilas testified. 
</P>
<P>
Because the worldwide pool of oil is bought and sold on the changing global 
market as a commodity, Bilas said, California or any other state or nation 
cannot "lock up" a chunk of the supply for its own uses. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bilas told a special hearing of the State Senate Energy Committee, 
the ripples of Middle East oil economics affect the pocketbooks of Californians 
to some extent even though California does not import oil from the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing called to take a preliminary look at the impact of the Persian 
Gulf crisis on California, Bilas said the state produces 47% of the crude oil 
it uses and imports 46% from Alaska. The other 7% comes from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that California imports (little) of its oil from foreign countries 
does not mean that we are independent from supply disruptions in other areas of 
the world," he told the committee. "Oil is sold in a worldwide market. So 
disruptions any place will, of necessity, affect the state of California."

INVADERS TAKING OVER LIVES, HOMES OF KUWAITIS, AMBASSADOR CHARGES

Invading Iraqis have been permitted to take over the homes and even wear the 
clothes of Kuwaitis who have been killed or have fled their homeland, Kuwait's 
ambassador to the United States charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah said in an interview that he had spoken by 
telephone to several Kuwaitis taking refuge in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, who 
reported that the Iraqis had made it easy for them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the fleeing Kuwaitis apparently are being replaced by Iraqis 
seeking to meld in with the local population, he contended. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trucking them in, busing them in, trying to replace the population, 
to change the makeup of the place," Saud said, adding they were issuing the new 
residents cards that identify them as Kuwaiti citizens. "They are giving them 
Kuwaiti clothes in order to make it appear that these are the people of Kuwait. 
They are taking the houses, robbing the houses." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials who have been detained by the Iraqi military and who have 
refused to cooperate have been executed, Saud claimed, adding: "We have 
eyewitness reports. Some were bused back to Baghdad for further interrogation. 
We don't know what has become of them." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti refugees have also reported that almost all government buildings and 
palaces have been blown up and destroyed, Saud said. 
</P>
<P>
There has been "mass destruction," he said, noting that all official 
installations except the water system and oil equipment are ruined. "Everything 
is gone."

POLLS OVER THE FORMER ATLANTA MAYOR AND U.N. AMBASSADOR.

Georgia Lt. Gov. Zell Miller won the Democratic nomination for governor 
Tuesday, cutting short Andrew Young's effort to become the state's first black 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
With 26% of precincts reporting, Miller had 153,602 votes or 71% and Young had 
62,984 votes or 29%, clearly enough to assure victory. 
</P>
<P>
Miller will face state Rep. Johnny Isakson, the Republican nominee, in November 
elections. Isakson had won the nomination outright in the July 17 primary. 
</P>
<P>
For Young, the loss closes a chapter in his long history of public service, 
including stints in Congress, the United Nations, and as mayor of Atlanta, and 
raises the question of what his next endeavor will be. 
</P>
<P>
Since the primary last month in which he outpolled Young but failed to win a 
majoity of Democratic votes, Miller, who has been lieutenant governor for 16 
years, had amassed a 20-point lead in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to overcome that lead, Young, in the final days of the contest, 
resorted to attack ads, labeling Miller "Zigzag Zell" and accusing him of 
waffling on several issues. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Young, who was accused of ignoring black voters before the first round of 
voting, made a concerted effort to attract them in recent weeks. He could be 
heard on black-oriented radio stations, touting his record as mayor of Atlanta 
and boasting of his achievements in the civil rights movement as a chief aide 
to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
However, Miller had hit upon an issue that proved to be a winner: a state 
lottery. Georgians by the thousands trek to Florida to buy lottery tickets and 
responded to Miller's promise to start one in this state. Miller also promised 
to apply part of the lottery proceeds to help the state's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's other high-profile campaign issue was the drug war, as he vowed to 
establish "military-style boot camps" for first offenders. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Young emphasized his worldwide contacts gained during his tenure 
as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and promised to attract business to 
the state, this providing jobs and economic prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
In other elections Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas, first-term Gov. Mike Hayden fought for survival in a Republican 
primary as his chief opponent, real estate executive Nestor Weigand Jr., tried 
to capitalize on voter anger over higher property taxes. On the Democratic 
side, former Gov. John Carlin was favored to win the first round of a comeback 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
In Michigan, Republicans picked opponents for two Democratic incumbents seeking 
third terms -- Gov. James Blanchard and Sen. Carl Levin. Polls showed Rep. Bill 
Schuette a heavy favorite over lawyer Clark Durant for the right to challenge 
Levin. State Sen. John Engler was expected to trounce General Motors engineer 
John Lauve and earn a shot at Blanchard. 
</P>
<P>
In Missouri, Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, sought the 
Democratic nomination for an eighth term against Nicholas F. Clement, a 
newspaper carrier who is a follower of extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche JR.

UNWISE TO QUIZ SOUTER ON SPECIFICS, STEVENS SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens said Tuesday that it would be unwise for the Senate 
to question Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter closely on specific legal 
issues during his confirmation hearings next month. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even if Souter directly responds to such questions, his answers may 
not disclose much about how he would rule as a justice, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Souter has said and written little on the most controversial issues 
before the high court, legal activists have said that senators must interrogate 
the longtime New Hampshire judge on such issues as abortion, civil rights, free 
speech and religion. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a key member of the Judiciary Committee, 
sounded that theme in a speech to the American Bar Assn. here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Souter's lack of a track record "means the Senate must ask more, not less, 
about his views," Kennedy said. "In this day and age, the Senate will not 
confirm a blank slate to the Supreme Court of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy denounced what he called "the unseemly attempts" by the Bush 
Administration to "muzzle the Senate confirmation process." 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is certain. The Senate Judiciary Committee intends to find out what 
Judge Souter thinks about the Constitution," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice Stevens, who was confirmed to the high court in 1975, disputed the 
common assumption that a nominee's answers to detailed questions will forecast 
his decisions on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens did not mention Souter directly and stopped short of urging the Senate 
to forgo the public questioning of President Bush's high court nominee. But he 
did voice doubt about whether the exercise is productive. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a mistake to predict, based on the confirmation hearings, how a nominee 
will vote when he comes on the court," the 70-year-old Stevens told an ABA 
gathering Tuesday. He cited as an example former Chief Justice Warren E. 
Burger, who was appointed as a law-and-order conservative by President Richard 
M. Nixon in 1969. "If he had been asked at his confirmation hearing about 
busing, he might have said it was not the best idea," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Burger in 1971 wrote the Supreme Court opinion that led to court-ordered 
busing for school desegregation nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens might have cited himself as an example of the unpredictability of court 
appointees. President Gerald R. Ford chose Stevens on the assumption that he 
would be a moderate conservative. Instead, he regularly sides with the court's 
liberal faction.

SALVADORAN REFUGEE SLAIN WHEN TENSIONS BOIL AT HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Day in and day out, the neighborhood street gang clustered on the concrete 
front porch of Juan Alberto Joya's cramped apartment in the Pueblo del Rio 
housing project south of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For the four months Joya and his family had lived there, they mostly put up 
with it, hunkered uneasily in their drab, concrete-block unit as the gang 
members joked and jostled just outside the window, brazenly playing music and 
selling crack cocaine during the day and far into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Joya had had enough. This battle of nerves seemed no better than El 
Salvador, the war-ravaged land he had fled in 1985. So on Monday afternoon, the 
40-year-old Salvadoran army veteran mustered his courage and tried to chase 
several of the gang members off his stoop. 
</P>
<P>
They argued. Then one of the youths fetched an assault rifle. He shot and 
killed Joya, spraying the apartment with 15 to 20 rounds of 
semiautomatic-weapons fire. 
</P>
<P>
The gang scattered after the shooting, but on Tuesday the suspected triggerman 
walked into a nearby police substation with an attorney and gave himself up. 
Cesari Hardman, 19, was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
For Joya's widow, Maria Mindala Aguilar, 44, the arrest offered little solace. 
She remains in the tiny two-bedroom apartment with the couple's 10-year-old 
daughter, Migdalia, grappling with a mixture of grief over the loss of her 
husband and fear that the threats and intimidation will never wane. 
</P>
<P>
Such fear seems as much a part of Pueblo del Rio as the baby-blue paint on its 
concrete walls. With its mix of blacks, Latinos and Cambodians, racial tensions 
only add to the gang woes, some residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"So many bullets, so many bullets," Aguilar murmured in Spanish, pointing to 
the scattered bullet holes in the apartment's block walls. "Things here can be 
just like in El Salvador. You can be in your house and they attack you. It's 
just the same." 
</P>
<P>
She said her family left El Salvador to find peace in the United States. They 
settled into a life as garment workers, but problems with the frequent 
immigration sweeps at the factories prompted Joya and his wife to save up and 
buy a pair of industrial-quality sewing machines to do piecework at home. 
</P>
<P>
All was fine, she said, until the family moved to Pueblo del Rio. From the 
beginning, she said, their apartment was a magnet for gang members, who seemed 
to find the family's unit, at the far end of a long building, a strategically 
perfect spot to avoid the prying eyes of police. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dennis Hegwood of the Housing Authority Police Department said officers 
have made significant inroads against gang problems in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged, the project remains a haven for some criminals, 
including drug dealers who come from nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his neighbors, Joya would take extreme precautions against the 
gang menace. 
</P>
<P>
Haunted by his days in the Salvadoran war, he slept most nights on the 
downstairs couch with a machete nearby in case thieves broke in, Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
As the weeks went by, the episodes with the gang escalated. It started with 
taunts and slurs, she said. Gang members took to camping out near the apartment 
door, laughing and shouting long after midnight. They pushed at the Joyas' 
front door menacingly, blew smoke in their faces as they passed by or urinated 
on the back step until the urine pooled inside the unit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said her husband kept his cool mostly, but a neighbor tells it 
differently. Lisa Moore, 22, lives just across a grassy courtyard from the Joya 
apartment. Moore said she had seen Joya on more than one occasion grab his 
machete and threaten residents, even small children, who got too close to his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time someone walked by he used to chase them with that sword of his," 
Moore said. "Every day he would be going off on you. . . . I don't think anyone 
deserves to be shot, but I guess they got tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
Others support Aguilar's story. Maria Nuno, another neighbor, said the gangs 
squat on her front porch as well, and have threatened her family with guns. By 
the time police arrive, the guns have disappeared and all is calm. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday it was him, tomorrow it may be someone else," said Nuno, 34, a 
mother of nine. "I fear they'll start spraying bullets around here with so many 
children." 
</P>
<P>
For Juan Joya, it was his child that finally prodded him to take action, his 
widow said. The girl reported to her parents that she had seen the girlfriend 
of a gang member pull down her pants to hide drugs inside her pantyhose. 
</P>
<P>
"He just couldn't take it anymore," Aguilar said. "After all the things that 
happened, that was it. He didn't want our daughter to see that anymore."

RULING LEAVES CRASH VICTIM AND JURY PERPLEXED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A JUDGE OVERTURNED THE $7.65-MILLION AWARD A PARALYZED WOMAN WON FROM 
THE CITY. SHE WONDERS HOW SHE'LL PAY FOR THERAPY; JURORS WONDERS WHY THEY SAT 
THROUGH TRIAL.

<P>
On the subject of life's disappointments, Susan Tartakoff speaks with some 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
A traffic accident stemming from a police chase left her paralyzed from the 
waist down in 1985. And a related $7.65-million jury verdict she won last 
spring against the city of Los Angeles has been thrown out by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling cancels the largest liability verdict ever levied against the city 
and leaves Tartakoff, 42, in bad financial shape with dwindling insurance 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't aware that this could happen," Tartakoff said Tuesday at her home in 
Northridge. "It was a big blow to me, because I don't know where my life is 
going to stand." 
</P>
<P>
The decision by retired Superior Court Judge Paul G. Breckenridge Jr. also has 
angered jurors who sat through the three-week trial and weeklong deliberations. 
Several said they believe police officials lied during their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"What were we there for?" asked juror Robert F. Dudley. "It was a waste of 
taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member jury concluded "without a shadow of a doubt" that the police were 
to blame, said Dudley, 36, an electrician at the Veterans Administration 
hospital in Westwood. "For her not to be compensated for the mishap is a damn 
shame." 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff was returning home from a video store about 8 p.m. Jan. 11, 1985, 
with movies she rented for her husband when a car that had been traveling at up 
to 100 miles an hour slammed into her car at a Chatsworth intersection. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit, Tartakoff claimed that the 19-year-old driver was being chased 
by Los Angeles police officers, who failed to turn on their siren or emergency 
lights. She never saw the car coming, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But police officers and representatives of the city attorney's office argued 
that the chase, if it ever began, had ended long before Tartakoff's car was 
struck. Therefore, they contended, the police officers had no obligation to 
warn other motorists away. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors interviewed over the past several days said they agreed early in their 
deliberations last March that the police were negligent in their conduct during 
the incident. Most of their deliberations were spent trying to determine a fair 
amount for the award, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not believe the witnesses of the Police Department, so they buried 
themselves," said Patrick F. Hoferer, 45, an electrician for Southern 
California Edison Co. Police officials denied that the officers were in 
pursuit, he said, but the jury made time and distance calculations and 
concluded that "they had to be in pursuit." 
</P>
<P>
Because the police did not turn on their lights or siren, "it was unanimous 
that they were guilty of not following their own procedures," he said. "This 
definitely was not a sympathy thing." 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Willis, 58, a cost accountant for ITT Cannon, said a substantial number 
of jurors sided with the city, but were swayed toward Tartakoff because of the 
judge's written instructions regarding negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff "had every right to at least have been warned that that police car 
was coming," Willis said. "They in no way warned anybody on the ground that 
there was anything going on." 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff might not have entered the intersection if she had heard a siren or 
seen a light, Willis added. 
</P>
<P>
The juror said she was surprised and bitter that the judge threw out the jury's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is totally unfair to Susan," she said. "Why do they even bother 
to pick a jury and go to all this taxpayer expense? Why don't they just have a 
judge?" 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling in May, Breckenridge said that the police did not cause the 
accident and that "there was nothing that the police could have done reasonably 
to prevent (the driver) from doing what he did." 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that he saw "no competent evidence" that the police were 
chasing the car at excessive speed. Further, he said, the police had no legal 
duty to warn Tartakoff of the approaching car. 
</P>
<P>
"The court does not believe that the police have a duty to use sirens to warn 
third parties whenever they are simply following a fleeing and recklessly 
driving criminal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Breckenridge added that he is not "insensitive" to the plight of Susan 
Tartakoff and her husband and added that he does not "lightly set aside the 
verdicts returned by conscientious jurors." 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff's lawyer, Timothy J. Wheeler, has filed an appeal of the judge's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car that struck her, Douglas Gray of Panorama City, was 
convicted in 1986 of driving under the influence of drugs, as well as other 
charges stemming from the incident, and was sentenced to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Gray had almost no insurance and Tartakoff has collected nothing from him. She 
is nearing the limit of her own $1-million health insurance policy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tartakoff, who was 36 at the time of the accident, has not been able to return 
to her job as a computer programmer at Universal Studios. She has spent the 
years since the crash in extensive physical therapy, and now has medical bills 
of about $5,000 a month. She remains in substantial pain, she said Tuesday, and 
her bowels and bladder do not function normally. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought when the verdict came through that at least I'd be able to continue 
therapies and take advantage of anything new that comes along," she said. "Now 
I don't know what I'm going to do."

POLITICAL TEASE SCHABARUM KEEPS THE 1ST DISTRICT GUESSING ON ELECTION PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, ever the political flirt, now says that running for 
the 1st District seat under a court-ordered plan intended to elect a Latino to 
the all-white board is a "serious option." 
</P>
<P>
How serious? 
</P>
<P>
"Sammy Serious is my middle name," said Schabarum, who played a central role in 
the legal fight over whether new political boundaries were needed to create 
opportunities on the board for nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Schabarum announced he was retiring from the board because being a 
supervisor was not "as much fun as other things these days." 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, the conservative supervisor said Judge David V. Kenyon's 
decision on Friday to implement a drastic redistricting plan had altered his 
thinking about the race. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum teasingly refused to elaborate, saying there were "too many unknowns 
to expand" on his vague hint. Pressed further by reporters, Schabarum squeezed 
his lips and hummed. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon ruled that the county had intentionally discriminated against Latino 
voters by diluting their voting power. He ordered that new district boundaries 
be drawn to increase a Latino's chances of winning a seat on the powerful 
five-man board. Under Kenyon's order, Schabarum's old district will be 
dominated by Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's handpicked successor, Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien, has 
expressed a reluctance to re-enter the race under the new district lines. 
O'Brien had finished second behind Schabarum's former aide, Sarah Flores, in 
the June primary, forcing a runoff between the two. They would be eligible to 
run for the seat still, as would Schabarum, even though they no longer live in 
the 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he would decide whether to run, Schabarum said, "Certainly before 
the filing deadline," which is Aug. 24. Schabarum's aide, Judy Hammond, 
confirmed that the supervisor has made inquiries about the candidate filing 
period with the county registrar-recorder. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Schabarum's musing was swift, and largely negative. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete can run, but he can't hide," said Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, who is a likely candidate for the new district seat. "He has a record 
to defend . . . a record that is inconsistent with the needs and aspirations of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said that Schabarum's potential candidacy is just a "spiteful" act, 
intended to gum up the election that could potentially elect the first Latino 
to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who is the only announced candidate in the new district, said, "May the 
best man, uh, person, win." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why Schabarum would consider running again, Flores said, "because 
he's Pete. He always likes to keep people guessing. . . . He's just trying to 
create a wrinkle." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's board colleagues were not surprised by Schabarum's statements, and 
they were not pleased at the prospect of him staying on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow conservative Supervisor Deane Dana said he was disappointed. "He's 
burned a lot of bridges. I would not be unhappy if he left," said Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich said it would be "hypocritical" for the four-term 
Schabarum to run when he is pushing a ballot measure limiting local officials 
to two terms. Antonovich conceded that Schabarum would be a "heavyweight" 
candidate even in the heavily Democratic and Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
"He has name recognition and a campaign treasury," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential candidates for the district include Los Angels City 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina and U.S. Reps. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), 
Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) and Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente). 
These Latino officials have vowed to present a united front in the race. 
</P>
<P>
The county has appealed Kenyon's ruling in favor of the redistricting and his 
adoption of the new political boundaries. The appeal has yet to be heard by a 
higher court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL PUTS WATTS REDEVELOPMENT ON 
HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council officially put on hold Tuesday a $200-million 
project to redevelop Watts, delaying plans to revitalize the economically 
depressed community until residents' fears of losing their homes can be 
allayed. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 11 to 0 without discussion to rescind its previous approval 
of what would have been the city's biggest redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they voted to have the Community Redevelopment Agency, which would 
carry out the project, and two citizens' advisory committees work over the next 
six months to resolve the concerns of many Watts residents, who fear they would 
be driven out by the sudden changes in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed redevelopment project was to have been an expansion of a 107-acre 
site that was established in 1968 along 103rd Street after the Watts riots 25 
years ago exposed the area's blight.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING ON GROUND WATER PROMISED IN 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After hearing arguments in a case involving severe ground water pollution in 
the San Gabriel Valley, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge said Tuesday she 
will issue a written opinion within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, a nine-member board of local water 
agency representatives, asked Judge Florence T. Pickard for increased authority 
to control how and where water is pumped. Agency attorney Ralph B. Helm argued 
that the expanded powers are needed to remedy one of the West's worst water 
pollution problems.

BILL BOYARSKY: WHAT A MERE $4.5 MILLION COULD DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching Los Angeles County's supervisors try to preserve the flimsy remains of 
their health care system this week, I wondered if another $4.5 million might 
save some threatened clinics. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't pull that figure out of the air. It's the minimum in taxpayers' 
dollars the supervisors have channeled into their legal defense against the 
U.S. Justice Department's charge that they rigged district boundaries to 
exclude Latinos from the board. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the legal expenses have been money down the drain. A federal judge 
ruled against the supervisors after a long trial. But the supes -- the kind of 
clients lawyers love -- aren't giving up. They're appealing, starting the long, 
expensive process they hope takes them to the U.S. Supreme Court. Their 
lawyers, I bet, hope so, too. 
</P>
<P>
But what if they hadn't resisted the Justice Department's attempt to create a 
supervisorial district that would assure a Latino being elected to the board? 
What if, instead, they'd used the $4.5 million to partially ease the impact of 
$138 million in reductions in state aid to the county made by Gov. George 
Deukmejian and the Legislature? How much difference would a few million dollars 
make in a county budget totaling almost $10 billion? 
</P>
<P>
Plenty. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the $4.5 million would more than cover the $3.39 million in cuts 
that the county mental health department has recommended for the San Fernando 
Valley Mental Health Clinic in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic, the only such facility in the entire Valley, serves the poorest of 
the mentally ill, those without health insurance, not even eligible for 
Medi-Cal aid from the government. Outpatient care, including prescriptions and 
counseling, keeps them sane. Their families also receive counseling, which 
helps the patients maintain a tenuous grasp on normal life. 
</P>
<P>
Or the supervisors could use the money in another part of the county. It would 
take just $877,454 to preserve present services at another facility designated 
for extinction, a center in Baldwin Park which provides short-term residential 
care for the San Gabriel Valley's mentally ill. Compton's clinic could remain 
in full operation for $963,000. Just $1.9 million would save a well-known, old 
mental health facility, the Gateways Mental Health Center in Echo Park, from 
recommended cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Less than $1 million would preserve services at a county-operated evaluation 
center at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, where the mentally ill go in 
a crisis for evaluation. The center is the only such screening facility for the 
San Gabriel and Pomona valleys and East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health care, of course, isn't the only county service that could use 
part of the $4.5 million. County government operates parks, the Sheriff's 
Department, the jails, the courts. The cuts in state aid are hitting most of 
these. 
</P>
<P>
I looked through a list of requests from the county lawmakers, programs and 
projects they'd like to finance if money was available. 
</P>
<P>
One was for $400,000 to develop a trail from the Santa Clara River to Castaic 
Creek in the far northern Valley -- with more than enough left for $344,000 to 
put more employees in the parks at nights and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
A $131,000 request would go to About Face, which serves seriously emotionally 
disturbed children in the San Gabriel Valley. And $438,000 would pay for a gang 
alternatives program in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
I could give you more figures, but I'm sure you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the reduction in services, there are two other issues involved. 
</P>
<P>
One is representative government. Although the supervisors hold open hearings 
on appropriations, there were no such sessions on paying lawyers to press on 
with the the redistricting fight. That's because the supervisors said they were 
entitled to confidentiality when discussing a lawsuit. In this case, taxpayers 
didn't get to say whether they wanted the money spent on legal fees or other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the supervisors made an open-ended financial commitment: $4.5 million 
represents the minimum price. 
</P>
<P>
It could grow. Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose job was threatened by the 
redistricting plan favored by the board's majority, was provided a lawyer to 
represent his interests -- at taxpayer expense. And if the county ultimately 
loses, a court might order the supervisors' to pay the multimillion-dollar 
legal fees run up by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the plaintiffs in the 
redistricting case. 
</P>
<P>
No, the gloomy county fiscal picture could not have been transformed by 
abandoning the expensive redistricting fight. The state cuts were too great for 
that. But at least the money would have provided a Band-Aid for some rather 
severe wounds. The supervisors had other priorities.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRANSTON URGES LARGER U.S. ROLE IN MASS 
TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying "intolerable traffic congestion is choking" the state, U.S. Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) told a Senate hearing in Los Angeles Tuesday that the 
federal government "must play a more active role in helping develop mass 
transit systems." 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing conducted by the Senate Urban Affairs subcommittee, which Cranston 
chairs, the senator said he hopes to make the Urban Mass Transit Act -- up for 
reauthorization next year -- "the basis for shaping the nation's mass transit 
policy over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
It is unrealistic to expect state and local governments to shoulder the full 
costs of our public transportation needs." 
</P>
<P>
Damage caused by automobile air pollution and economic losses caused by traffic 
congestion are local problems, "but they have a national impact," Cranston 
said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 GIRLS FOUND UNHARMED AFTER NIGHT IN 
FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three teen-age girls who became lost hiking during a church outing in the 
rugged Angeles National Forest were rescued by authorities at daybreak Tuesday, 
unharmed but shaken by their night under lightning- and thunder-filled skies. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said the girls -- ages 13, 14 and 15 -- heard a helicopter 
at daybreak and hiked to a clearing. The search team found the girls at 7:15 
a.m. near Inspiration Point, about half a mile from Angeles Crest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
They were rain-soaked, mud-caked and crying on a clearing in the Big Pines area 
of the forest, where terrain is considered among the most rugged on the West 
Coast, said Sgt. Gordon Carn, coordinator of rescue team that spotted the 
hikers.

BRANDO SON PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: HE IS RETURNED TO JAIL AFTER FAILING TO POST $10 MILLION BAIL AND 
SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Actor Marlon Brando's son Christian pleaded not guilty Tuesday to murder and 
illegal-weapons charges, and was returned to jail after he failed to post $10 
million bail and surrender his passport. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Brando's attorney, Robert Shapiro, asked Santa Monica Superior 
Court Judge David Perez to consider reducing the amount of bail and attaching 
conditions to it "that will satisfy the most skeptical person that Christian 
will definitely appear" for trial. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said outside court that conditions he may propose include placing 
Brando under "house arrest" using 24-hour guards, or requiring him to wear an 
electronic monitoring device on his wrist or ankle that would allow authorities 
to keep him under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Perez scheduled a bail hearing for Thursday and pretrial motions for Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to ask that Christian not be singled out and treated any 
differently than anyone else would be in a similar situation," Shapiro told a 
throng of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how Marlon Brando's fame and fortune could be disregarded in setting bail 
high enough to ensure that the actor's son will not flee, Shapiro replied, 
"That's not him, that's his father. He's just a 32-year-old welder. And he's so 
high-profile. Where could he go?" 
</P>
<P>
He said that bail on such charges as the younger Brando faces is usually set at 
$50,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"And the highest I've ever heard of, going through a bail bondsman, is $3 
million," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-day preliminary hearing last month, Brando was ordered to stand 
trial on one count of murder with special allegations and one count of 
possessing a machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
He has admitted shooting Dag Drollet, 26, the boyfriend of his pregnant 
half-sister, in May at his father's Mulholland Drive estate. But he said it was 
an accident: 
</P>
<P>
"I shot him, man, but not on purpose," Brando told police minutes after the 
incident. "We were both in a fit of rage; the gun went off. . . . Please 
believe me, I wouldn't do it (shoot someone intentionally) in my father's 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Although prosecutors asked that Brando be held without bail, Los Angeles 
Municipal Court Judge Larry Fidler last month set bail at $10 million and 
ordered that Brando surrender his passport. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had argued that Brando might attempt to leave the country as his 
half-sister, Cheyenne Brando, did. She returned to her home in Tahiti, 
presumably to avoid testifying against her brother, and has since given birth 
to Drollet's child. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Shapiro told Fidler that the amount of bail was not an issue, 
given the family's resources. But as days, and then weeks, passed, Brando 
remained in county jail, the lawyer said, because the family was unable to find 
his passport. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the passport Tuesday, he said, "We'll discuss those issues on 
Thursday" at the bail hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Paparazzi, tourists, groupies and several women claiming to be the defendant's 
girlfriend jammed the corridors of the small seaside courthouse Tuesday. Most 
left disappointed when the elder Brando did not show up for the brief 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
In court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Barshop read the charges, then asked the 
defendant, "Mr. Brando, to the two charges, do you enter a plea of not guilty?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," answered Brando, who had changed from jail blues to a white shirt, tie, 
and slacks for his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said later that he had asked Marlon Brando not to go to court Tuesday 
in an effort to avoid turning the hearing into a celebrity spectacle.

BOY, 4, KILLED PLAYING WITH GUN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 4-year-old boy playing with a loaded gun shot and killed himself Tuesday 
after his mother tried to coax the weapon from him, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified as Jeauxneille Jeileouxn Jones, had apparently picked up 
and started playing with a small-caliber pistol belonging to his mother's 
boyfriend in the living room of their home on West 37th Place, Detective 
Richard Taft said. The boy then ran to his mother's bedroom to show the weapon 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, Linda Givhan, told the boy, who was standing a few feet away, to 
"be still and put the gun down," Taft said. Instead, Jeauxneille turned and 
ran. As he scurried away, the gun went off, the bullet striking the boy in the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened so quick, there was very little she (the mother) could do, if 
anything, at that point," Taft said. "It doesn't take a lot to pull the trigger 
on a gun like that." 
</P>
<P>
Jeauxneille was taken to Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, where he was 
pronounced dead at 10 a.m., about half an hour after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The incident remained under investigation Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, of the police Juvenile Division, said there was "some negligence" in 
leaving the gun where the boy could reach it. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed, but detectives said the case will be reviewed by 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Jeauxneille's uncle, Dominic Givhan, said the boy's 21-year-old mother is a 
student at a local vocational school where she is studying to become a fashion 
designer. He said the gun belonged to the boyfriend, whose name was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my only little nephew," Givhan said. "He was my pal. This weekend I was 
going to take him to get some tennis shoes. He was waiting for me to take him 
to Disneyland."

CITIES HURT BY ENERGY SLUMP HOPEFUL AGAIN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait may have provoked fears of a recession for most 
Americans, but in Denver and other U.S. cities where the oil industry has been 
in a deep slump since the mid-1980s, the subsequent jump in oil prices was 
cause for cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and other petroleum-producing states, analysts 
said the price rise could help sagging regional economies rebound from years of 
stagnation -- but only if oil continues to sell for $25 a barrel for a year or 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"If it continues for a long-term period, our economy will benefit at the 
expense of other parts of the nation," said Nancy McCallin, chief economist 
with the Colorado Legislative Council, a research arm for the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver, the decline in local oil production is blamed, among other things, 
for a slumping real estate market and construction industry. The city has a 23% 
vacancy rate in office space, mostly in the gleaming downtown towers built to 
house Texaco, Exxon and other companies that worked the Colorado oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
The glut of cheap oil in the '80s has had an even more severe impact in Texas, 
where annual oil production declined from nearly 1.3 billion barrels during the 
Arab oil embargo in 1973 to only 762 million barrels in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, housing values in Houston fell by 30% or more as those who 
settled in the region during the good times left in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Now, four years after hitting the bottom of the slump in 1986, some parts of 
the Oil Patch have made a comeback. And some regions stand to benefit more from 
higher oil prices than others, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Houston and Dallas have developed more diversified economies 
that are less dependent on the whims of the international petroleum market. 
High-technology industries have played an important role in the economic 
recovery of Texas' two largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Brown, senior economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, estimates 
that every $1 increase in the price of oil could add 15,000 jobs in Texas, 40% 
of them in the oil industry and the rest in retailing, service and other 
industries. So if oil hovers at $22 a barrel, Brown predicts 50,000 new jobs in 
Texas, which represents less than a 1% increase in employment in the state over 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase (in oil prices) will help some, but we're really not talking 
about very much here. Even at $25 a barrel, it isn't very exciting," he said. 
The energy industry represents only 10% of the gross state product, compared to 
20% in 1981, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in Louisiana and the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa, a sustained 
period of high oil prices would be a desperately needed boost to the local 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
"(Midland-Odessa) is still largely energy-dependent. Clearly, the thing that 
would bring that area back is energy," said Ralph Carestio, vice president for 
real estate and energy with NCNB, a Dallas bank. "If this isn't just a 
short-term spike, it's good news for the Texas economy and for domestic 
producers in general." 
</P>
<P>
John Faulkinberry, chief financial officer of Paramount Petroleum Co., a 
four-year-old Houston-based independent oil producer, said: "We hate to see a 
war key this chain of events, but we've all been smiling. We're steaming right 
ahead." Faulkinberry said Paramount drilled 22 wells in 1989 and is planning to 
drill 45 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite a $5 increase in oil prices the past week, officials in Colorado 
and Texas said they are unwilling to link the future of their regional 
economies to what they see as an inherently volatile and unstable situation in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too uncertain right now," added McCallin, the Colorado economist. "I 
can't imagine that you're going to see any large oil producers saying it makes 
more sense to drill in Colorado right now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, few in the oil industry were willing to predict an increase in domestic 
drilling any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see a lot of companies that are gun-shy. After coming off this 
depression, they're going to wait and see what happens," Faulkinberry said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's far too early to say this is going to mean anything wonderful for 
domestic production," said Jere Smith, a spokesman for Phillips Petroleum Co. 
in Bartlesville, Okla. "You can't base your capital spending on one week of 
price increases." 
</P>
<P>
Smith added that Phillips is more likely to initiate new drilling abroad than 
it is domestically. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Weinstein, an economist at the University of North Texas, said he 
believed oil prices would have to stay in the mid-20s for at least three months 
before the oil industry would consider stepping up domestic production. 
</P>
<P>
And, Weinstein added, it could be from one to three years before an overall 
improvement in the Texas economy could be felt. 
</P>
<P>
"On balance, Texas stands more to gain than lose in higher prices," Weinstein 
said. If $25-per-barrel oil sticks, Weinstein said $8 billion will be added to 
the gross state product over the next year, creating 64,000 new jobs and $258 
million in state and local tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
While oil is "not the dominant industry it once was in Texas, higher energy 
prices will give our oil and gas sector a shot in the arm that it needs," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Small and independent producers fueled much of the Texas oil boom in the '70s 
and '80s. Many of those companies went under when crude prices sunk to $10 per 
barrel in 1986. Even as oil pushed toward $30 per barrel this week, most 
independents were sounding a word of caution. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of uncertainty involved in all of this," said Don Covey, 
president of the exploration and production division of Houston-based Mitchell 
Energy &amp; Development Co. "We've just been in this a few days, and we don't 
know how long it's going to last. It's going to take time to see how it shakes 
out."

More Trouble for Stotler Group: The Chicago brokerage said it was served with a 
class-action shareholder lawsuit that charges that it gave false and misleading 
information about its financial condition in public filings with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. Stotler was the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy 
filing last week by three creditors who said they were stuck with more than $1 
million in unredeemed loans and investments.

Judge Throws Out Most of Suit: A Superior Court judge barred a former employee 
of Shuwa Investments Corp. from pursuing most allegations that two top 
executives beat and harassed him. Former Shuwa accountant Hajime Tanioka 
charged in an August, 1989, suit that President Takaji Kobayashi and Executive 
Vice President Takeshi Shiratori attacked him in 1987 and 1988. Judge Richard 
Lavine ruled that a one-year statute of limitations invalidated six of seven 
parts of the complaint.

Buchwald-Case Warning: Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider said 
he may have to have his own expert examine Paramount Pictures' books because of 
the "ephemeral" nature of material that has been supplied by Paramount and Art 
Buchwald in their dispute over profits from the film "Coming to America." He 
warned the two sides that if testimony produces only "platitudes and all kinds 
of generalizations" about Hollywood accounting practices, he will ask an 
outside party to sort out the truth. Hearings are expected to begin in 
mid-October.

<P>
The Soviet Union announced Tuesday that it would introduce domestic money 
exchanges next year where the ruble, battered by a growing black market, would 
trade freely against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the decision, effective Jan. 1, was an integral 
part of the coming switch from a planned to a market economy and would help 
prepare the ground for eventual ruble convertibility. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said a previously unannounced government decree dated Aug. 4 
provided for the opening of exchanges in Moscow, the capitals of the 15 Soviet 
republics and in other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how far foreign organizations would be able to 
take part in dealing on the exchanges, but a Finance Ministry official said he 
saw no obstacle to non-Soviet banks joining in. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said the main purpose of the 
exchanges would be "to enable Soviet enterprises and organizations who have no 
export potential to buy currency to purchase equipment abroad for their own 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviet businesses, gaining increasing independence under President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's economic reforms, hold vast sums of rubles but have no access to 
foreign currency because they produce only for the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the state Bank for Foreign Economic Relations 
(Vneshekonombank) has held occasional currency auctions for Soviet 
organizations, but newly emerging commercial banks are known to be keen to take 
part in these operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry official said the exchanges, likely to be open at least 
twice a week, were an extension of auctions held once a month in which only 
Soviet organizations have been allowed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
One Western banker in Moscow said there would be a clear interest for foreign 
sellers to act on the new exchanges despite the limited demand for the ruble, 
which has not been freely traded in the outside world since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry official said there was no question at this stage of 
allowing export of rubles, at present strictly banned, for sale abroad to raise 
hard currency. "These will be purely domestic markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Gosbank would control interbank and all other operations at 
the new exchanges, which would be the first in the Soviet Union for six 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The assertion that the measure was a move toward convertibility, or free 
exchange of the ruble on world markets, surprised Soviet economists and foreign 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
Even Soviet government experts have said frequently that this was unlikely to 
be achieved before the mid-1990s at the earliest, even if the long-delayed 
switch to a market system brings a quick boost to the crumbling economy. 
</P>
<P>
The ruble has two officially set exchange rates -- a trading one of 0.58 
against the dollar and a tourist rate of 5.8 to the dollar. But on the black 
market, Soviet business publications say, the dollar sells for up to 25 rubles. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials admit that the official rate, calculated against a basket of 
Western currencies and at which all official foreign transactions are carried 
out, is grossly out of line with the ruble's real value. 
</P>
<P>
It has been widely assumed by foreign and Soviet specialists that the ruble 
could not be freely traded on world markets without devastating effects on the 
already weak economy before radical economic reforms took hold. 
</P>
<P>
The government announcement did not make clear exactly how far the ruble would 
be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
It is now being rapidly replaced in domestic trade by barter and even the 
dollar amid widespread shortages of many goods.

CAL FED TO BUY SOME EMPIRE S&amp;L BRANCHES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
California Federal Bank, moving to further expand its Southern California 
customer base, said Tuesday that it will take over certain branches and 
deposits from Empire Federal Savings of America. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based thrift said it will acquire about $265 million in 
deposits from Empire, taking over three Southern California branches and 
assuming deposits from 10 others. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Fed will not acquire any loans from Empire in the deal, spokesman James F. 
Hurley said. Cal Fed, the nation's fourth-largest thrift with $23 billion in 
assets, did not disclose terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Empire, based in Buffalo, N.Y., has been in receivership since February. 
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with disposing of ailing 
S&amp;Ls, put the entire 122-branch thrift up for sale in June. 
</P>
<P>
Pending approval of federal regulators, Cal Fed will take over Empire's 
branches in Santa Monica, Woodland Hills and Monterey Park, effective Sept. 7. 
Deposits at the 10 other branches involved will be transferred to existing Cal 
Fed branches on the same date. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Fed will inform customers where their deposits will be transferred "almost 
immediately," Hurley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Empire branches whose deposits will be transferred are located in Westlake 
Village, Encino, Hacienda Heights, Bellflower, Seal Beach, Fountain Valley, 
Costa Mesa, Irvine, Upland and Laguna Hills.

SECURITY PACIFIC LOOKS TO HELP IN UAL BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: A COALITION OF BANKS IS ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE FINANCING FOR AN 
EMPLOYEE TAKEOVER. RISING FUEL PRICES CLOUD THE PICTURE.

<P>
Security Pacific National Bank confirmed Tuesday that it has joined a group of 
banks searching for financing for the proposed $4.38-billion employee buyout of 
UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
But the buyout faces an uncertain future given rising fuel prices, which would 
add several million dollars to the annual cost of operating the nation's 
second-largest airline. The board of Chicago-based UAL will meet today amid 
speculation that the union-led buyout group will be forced to ask for an 
extension of its Thursday financing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's stock fell $9.75 a share Tuesday to close at $101 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. On July 27, the stock closed at $163. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys continue to work on the deal," said Steven Matthews, a spokesman in 
New York for the employee group. "No extension has been requested." 
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by former Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, has been 
pressuring aircraft and engine manufacturers to invest in the buyout. The 
failure to find an equity partner has caused three defections from a five-bank 
group that had informally agreed several weeks ago to arrange about $4 billion 
in bank financing. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chemical Banking Corp., Citicorp and Chase Manhattan are reported to 
be interested in rejoining Bankers Trust New York and Manufacturers Hanover if 
an equity investor materializes. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific spokeswoman Penny Maines said the Los Angeles-based bank is 
"involved in discussions with the buyout group and Bankers Trust and 
Manufacturers Hanover, and we are continuing to work on the transaction." 
Maines declined to say whether Security Pacific had agreed to lend $500 million 
to the effort as each of the original five banks had tentatively agreed to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It could well be too little, too late, particularly in light of what our 
friends in the Middle East are doing," said Scott Hamilton, an editor of 
Commercial Aviation Report, an airline financing newsletter. "The banks were 
hardly enthusiastic about this deal a week ago and now . . . an iffy deal 
becomes even worse."

Suit Over Canceled S&amp;L Bonuses: A former attorney for Imperial Savings 
Assn. has sued the federal government, charging that the agency responsible for 
cleaning up the S&amp;L mess deprived executives of the failed thrift of $1 
million in bonuses. In a class-action suit in federal court, Jack Cohen alleged 
that the Resolution Trust Corp. broke the law because directors of the thrift's 
parent company approved the bonuses before its seizure.

<P>
OIL SHOCK IS TWO SIDED COIN FOR MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
TRADING: ON ONE HAND, IT MAY BOOST THE PRICE OF THE COUNTRY'S CRUDE. BUT IF IT 
TRIGGERS A RECESSION IN THE UNITED STATES, EXPORTS WILL SUFFER.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexicans should be dancing on their oil barrels at the prospect of higher 
petroleum prices resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but the local stock 
exchange index has dropped 3.4% since last week's occupation. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction is a gauge of how much the Mexican economy has changed since 1982, 
when oil accounted for three-fourths of exports. Every $1-a-barrel increase in 
the price of oil still brings Mexico an extra $1.2 million a day in badly 
needed foreign exchange, and that will ease -- but not eliminate -- a trade 
deficit projected to top $2.5 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
However, if oil prices rise enough to cause a recession in the United States, 
it could mean trouble for the two-thirds of Mexican exports not related to oil. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is the question of whether Mexico has enough production 
capacity to increase exports -- taking advantage of higher prices -- without 
cutbacks in domestic supplies of oil products. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has cut exports by one-fifth since 1984. In July, it exported 1.23 
million barrels a day. That was 190,000 barrels a day less than the quota 
assigned it under voluntary agreements with other producers that -- like Mexico 
-- are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
Production has slipped nearly 1% a year, while domestic demand has grown at 
about the same rate. 
</P>
<P>
As overall exports have dropped, the United States has remained a steady 
customer, buying 780,000 barrels a day of Mexico's highest-grade oil. In July, 
two-thirds of Mexico's exports were sold to the United States, in violation of 
a Mexican policy to restrict any customer's purchases to no more than half of 
total exports. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all Mexican exports are sold through long-term contracts, tied to 
spot-market prices. However, under terms of the contracts, the country is 
excluded from the kind of quick profits available to those who trade directly 
on the spot market. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first concern is to supply the domestic market," said a spokesman for the 
Energy, Mining and State Industries Ministry, which sets policy for Mexico's 
government-owned oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking a discreet approach," he added, a marked contrast to the 
euphoria that accompanied the oil price hikes of 14 years ago. Unless prices 
remain more than $5 a barrel higher than they were before the invasion, 
economists are betting against a repeat of the 1970s. At that time, Mexico 
relied on oil exports to earn foreign exchange that sustained a protectionist 
economy with high import tariffs and few non-petroleum exports. 
</P>
<P>
Since the oil bust, Mexico has lowered tariffs and cut subsidies on a variety 
of products, trimming the government's role in the economy and encouraging 
non-oil exports and foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, fear of a recession in the United States -- which buys two-thirds of 
Mexico's exports and accounts for 63% of its foreign investment -- explains the 
plunge in what had been a bull market, said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O. 
</P>
<P>
The fear behind the fear is that oil prices will rise enough -- say $5 a barrel 
-- to persuade the government to change its business-supported policy of 
cutting the state's role in the economy to make the country more 
internationally competitive. 
</P>
<P>
In an international depression, Ramirez de la O. said, "it is not popular to 
gear economic instruments to exports and increased capital flows. What (the 
government) would otherwise be doing to maintain external competitiveness would 
not be justified." 
</P>
<P>
However, Mexican economists and government officials said they do not expect 
sustained high price levels. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico expects the Iraq-Kuwait conflict to be resolved as rapidly as it 
developed, making its impact on prices questionable, except in the extremely 
short term. 
</P>
<P>
MEXICO'S OIL POTENTIAL 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's petroleum reserves are higher while daily production has leveled off.

JAPAN IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE TO WEATHER AN OIL SHOCK THAN IN '73; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE NATION IS NO LONGER THE ENERGY-DEVOURING MONSTER THAT IT WAS IN 
THE EARLY 1970S WHEN HEAVY INDUSTRY DOMINATED THE ECONOMY.

<P>
In 1973, when the first oil shock struck, Japan panicked. Housewives scrambled 
to buy up toilet paper. Diplomats kowtowed to Arab wishes. Before the chaos 
ended, prices shot through the roof and the gross national product shrank for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
But as the world's third oil shock gets under way, panic has struck only 
Japan's paper economy. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which took a beating for three months until 
the 225-share Nikkei stock index bottomed at 28,002.07 on April 2, have started 
another plunge. On Tuesday, a new low for the year was reached: 27,653.07, down 
28.9% from the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the fear gripping the stock market in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
last week stems not from concern that Japan will run short of oil but that 
increases in oil prices will increase inflationary pressures and produce higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Growth in the real economy is expected to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth S. Courtis, strategist and senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital 
Markets, Tokyo, said a weak yen and strong signs of an overheating Japanese 
economy make price stability the immediate concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week's spark from the (Persian) Gulf . . . will increase still further 
the concern for higher interest rates. Certainly, that is the message that the 
(stock) market is now screaming," Courtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Masaru Yoshitomi, director of the government Economic Planning Agency's 
Economic Research Institute, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Rising oil prices, coming on top of a money supply that has registered seven 
straight months of double-digit growth, threaten to spur inflation, Yoshitomi 
said. Japan must tighten its monetary policy, he declared, and the government 
should shelve its policy -- newly adopted at American urging -- of increasing 
public works spending. 
</P>
<P>
Courtis and Yoshitomi, however, predicted that the impact of the new crisis 
will be minimal compared to the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 -- and not simply 
because of Japan's comfortable 142-day supply of stockpiled oil. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan imports nearly all of its oil, it is no longer the 
energy-devouring monster that it was in the early 1970s, when its energy 
consumption was expanding 64% faster than the rest of the world's and when 
energy-intensive industries dominated the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1973, Courtis said, energy conservation efforts and economic 
restructuring have been so successful that real output is more than double what 
it was then, with no growth at all in energy input. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, petroleum accounted for 75% of energy consumption. Now it accounts for 
58%. Nuclear power, which produced only 2.4% of total energy, now provides 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Most significant, Courtis and Yoshitomi agreed, at the time of the first oil 
shock a 10% increase in oil prices foreshadowed a 1% increase in consumer 
prices. Now, the impact is only 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
That level of impact, said Shosuke Tanaka, research director of the 
government's Economic Planning Agency, "is much smaller than in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan depended upon Iraq and Kuwait for 10.6% of its oil imports 
during the past two years, the reliance amounted to only 4.8% of Japan's total 
energy consumption, Courtis said. "While not unimportant, these figures are 
only three-fifths of what they were in the mid-1970s," he added. 
</P>
<P>
If crude oil prices rise to $25 a barrel from $18 and stay at that level for 12 
months, Yoshitomi said, growth in Japan's GNP would be depressed by only 0.4%. 
Oil imports represented the equivalent of 5% of Japan's GNP at the time of the 
oil shocks in the 1970s but now equal only 1% of the GNP, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the United States, where pump prices for gasoline have risen 
sharply since the invasion, Japanese oil executives said they planned no 
immediate increase in the price of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Even a recession in the United States will not produce the effect here that it 
did in previous years, Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese exports to the United States would decline if the American economy 
fell into a recession, he said. "But Japan's economy is not dependent upon 
exports for growth. Domestic demand is spurring growth. The effect of a U.S. 
recession would be very small," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist of the Nomura Research Institute, said the 
growth in Japan's reliance on non-oil energy sources is likely to forestall the 
inflation that occurred after the first oil shock, when consumer prices 
skyrocketed 35% at one point. 
</P>
<P>
Okumura said many Japanese companies, perturbed neither by rising interest 
rates nor by the January-March turmoil on the stock market, remain able and 
eager to carry out aggressive investment plans. Large reserves, built up during 
a two-year period of super-low interest rates and hefty profits from stock and 
land trading, have provided the leeway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than $666.7 billion (100 trillion yen) has been loaned by commercial banks 
in the past three years. Corporations have raised $333.3 billion (50 trillion 
yen) in new issues of stocks, convertible bonds and warrants in domestic and 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the new crisis came just as the Bank of Japan had written off as 
negligible the effect of the January-March setback in stock, bond and yen 
values. Private-sector economists, who in April had revised their forecasts for 
real growth in fiscal 1990 down to as low as 3.6%, were raising them back up. 
</P>
<P>
New predictions made in late July by 26 research and financial institutions 
averaged 4.6%, compared to the government's initial forecast of 4%. One 
prediction forecast a 5.4% gain in the GNP. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was written before the new oil crisis erupted, a government 
"economic white paper" approved by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Cabinet on 
Tuesday declared that Japan's economy had developed a sustaining power of its 
own to continue a 45-month expansion, the second longest. During that period, 
the economy has expanded at an average annual real growth of 5.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Abrupt changes caused by the Mideast turmoil will not affect the "overall tone" 
of predictions in the white paper, Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
Kabun Muto, minister of international trade and industry, said Tuesday that the 
government will implement a new package of energy-conserving measures -- 
possibly including daylight savings time -- and will allow oil stockpiles to 
fall to restrain price increases. Kaifu on Monday had urged people to start 
conserving energy voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who had scheduled a trip to the Mideast for Aug. 15-27 
before Iraq invaded Kuwait, was reported planning to ask Saudi Arabia and Oman 
to increase their overall production as well as their shipments to Japan. Media 
reports said Kaifu would ask Saudi leaders to relay to the United Arab Emirates 
Japan's wishes that it do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Muto said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had already rejected 
production increases, but his ministry planned to make continued appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Japan gets 20.5% of its oil imports from the UAE -- its biggest supplier -- 
16.8% from Saudi Arabia and 5% from Oman, which ships half its exports to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu also will visit Turkey, Jordan and Egypt during the overseas tour. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest immediate impact of Japan's sanctions against Iraq fell upon about 
100 Japanese firms that have been left holding some 700 billion yen ($4.7 
billion) in unpaid debts from past dealings. Only 60% of the debt is covered by 
export insurance. Iraq reportedly owed Mitsubishi Corp. about 150 billion yen 
($1 billion). 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions also threw cold water on seven contracts that nine Japanese 
trading companies had just concluded for plant exports worth 43.1 billion yen 
($287 million), including two Mitsubishi oil refinery-related projects worth 
29.5 billion yen ($198.7 million).

THE MIDEAST CRISIS: ASSESSING THE DAMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST CRISIS THROWS FUEL ON FIRE OF OIL FIRMS' IMAGE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Iraq's invasion of Kuwait should really help the cleanup efforts in Alaska," 
wise-cracked comedian Jay Leno. "Exxon will be up there now squeezing the oil 
out of every one of those rocks." 
</P>
<P>
You probably haven't heard that zinger yet. Leno wrote it late Tuesday and said 
he plans to tell it during his "Tonight Show" monologue tonight. Surely the 
disparaging way Leno jokes about the oil industry is much the way the public at 
large feels. 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives and consultants say that with the recent spate of oil 
spills and price hikes, the public perception of oil companies has rarely been 
so low. So who is to blame? Most say the oil companies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes across as if the oil companies really don't care," said Ronald 
Rogers, president of the Los Angeles crisis management firm, Rogers &amp; 
Associates. "For years they've fought every type of environmental legislation. 
Then, they raise prices even though the consumer knows that what happens in the 
Middle East shouldn't affect prices at the pumps for months. Most consumers are 
just throwing up their hands and saying: There they go again." 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry's credibility problems have plagued it for the past two 
decades. In 1973, there was harsh criticism that the price hikes and gasoline 
lines were the result of a crisis manufactured by the oil companies themselves. 
And in 1979, when prices rose sharply again, these same criticisms were leveled 
by consumers and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
New complaints about the oil industry's sensitivity to environmental concerns 
were heard in March, 1989, when the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William 
Sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil. Exxon also was criticized 
when gasoline price hikes resulted later. In February, a British 
Petroleum-leased tanker spilled 394,000 gallons of crude oil that marred 
beaches across Orange County. And late last month, some 500,000 gallons of 
heavy oil spilled into Galveston Bay after a tanker collision. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry image is so poor that even top executives are speaking out 
against industry colleagues. "There has been a deafening silence by most oil 
companies," said George Babikian, president of Arco Products Co., the refining 
and marketing division of Atlantic Richfield Co. "I think they feel the price 
hikes are too difficult to explain, so they're not even trying." 
</P>
<P>
But Babikian says Arco is so concerned about the current image problems that 
are haunting the company and the entire industry that its public relations 
staff has assembled a so-called white paper to try to explain the reasons 
behind the recent price hikes. That paper, expected to be completed Friday, 
will be available to anyone who requests it. 
</P>
<P>
No new Arco advertisements are planned, however. "I don't think they'd be 
believed at this point," said Babikian. "We have a credibility problem to 
overcome." 
</P>
<P>
An outspoken critic of how oil firms are dealing with this image problem is one 
of the oil industry's former public relations wizards. "The oil companies are 
doing themselves and the public a disservice by not speaking out on the 
issues," said Herb Schmertz, former vice president of public affairs at Mobil 
Oil Co. Besides explaining the recent jump in gasoline prices, the companies 
should also try to explain why America is still so dependent on foreign oil -- 
and what policies need to be changed, said Schmertz, now a public affairs 
consultant in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is entitled to this information," said Schmertz, who helped create 
some of the editorial-type ads that Mobil ran on the opinion pages of several 
major newspapers. "The oil companies should use all communication techniques 
available -- including paid and unpaid media." 
</P>
<P>
At least some consultants agree. "If the oil companies want to avoid a major 
backlash in public opinion, they need to be considering some paid advertising 
to break through the clutter," said Peter B. Necarsulmer, president of San 
Francisco-based PBN Co., a crisis management public relations firm that 
specializes in advising oil companies. After the Orange County oil spill, PBN 
advised British Petroleum on its actions. 
</P>
<P>
Besides paid advertising, Necarsulmer says, oil companies should also 
distribute information on the current price hikes at service stations and in 
credit card billings. "They have a legitimate story to tell," he said. "They 
just need to get the facts out on the table." 
</P>
<P>
But some experts say that no matter how the oil companies try to explain the 
price hikes -- or improve their images -- it won't work. "I don't think there 
will ever be a way for big oil companies to be understood," said William C. 
Adams, former public relations director for Phillips Petroleum Co. and now 
associate professor of mass communications at Florida International University 
in North Miami. "How can they win in the court of public opinion with so much 
going against them?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, most oil companies would probably like to improve the public's 
perception of them, said Bari Harlam, assistant professor of marketing at 
Columbia University. "But I'm not sure they have any idea how to do it."

PRESENT A BRAVE FRONT AS THEY STRIVE TO IMPRESS OTHERS WITH THE PLIGHT THEIR 
HOMELAND FACES.

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kuwaiti ambassador has just set down the phone receiver, and his hand, 
although clammy and cool, smells sweetly of after-shave. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah, 45, descendant of a family that has ruled Kuwait 
for 256 years, is part of a clan of 1,000 cousins, aunts, uncles, nephews and 
nieces, who, until seven days ago, controlled the tiny sheikdom perched on the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Saud's uncle is the emir; his cousin is the crown prince; his son-in-law is the 
emir's son. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the reports of terror and chaos in their occupied country, Saud is 
not about to crumble and let the family down. 
</P>
<P>
While commanding the phone, watching the Cable News Network broadcasts and 
reading dispatches, Saud, wearing a fine British-tailored suit and red Jacquard 
silk tie, poises on a burgundy velvet banquette in what is usually the ballroom 
of his diplomatic residence. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the room has been turned into Kuwait's American 
mobilization headquarters. Vast and airy, this space is a fantasy of Middle 
Eastern decor with blue and yellow tiles covering what seems like acres of 
floor. There is a small fountain in the center of the room; it reflects 
latticed woodwork on the ceiling and tall silk floral arrangements nearby. 
</P>
<P>
But amid this splendor are signs of crisis: a giant map of the Middle East on 
an easel; an enormous color television with the sound turned down; two 
telephones; a coffee percolator; a platter of fresh fruit; several U.S. agents 
hanging around, trying to look discreet. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week, Saud has barely slept, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Day and night, he says, he has been laboring to make Americans understand the 
injustices he says the invading Iraqis have inflicted on his oil-rich homeland. 
</P>
<P>
He has been in constant contact with the White House; he translated for 
President Bush in a call with the emir, who escaped to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Saud has appeared on the "Today" show and "Nightline"; he has conducted two 
press conferences in the Embassy. On Monday, he went to Capitol Hill to talk to 
Republican and Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The phones have become his preoccupation. 
</P>
<P>
"Just now, that call . . . was from Saudi Arabia," he says, pointing to the 
white multibutton telephone console as if it's a time bomb about to explode. 
"The calls don't stop." 
</P>
<P>
He says Kuwaiti government officials have been taken to Baghdad and executed; 
several government buildings in Kuwait have been blown up. "They're destroying 
everything, everything but the oil equipment," Saud says, his voice 
intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
But then, as if a wave comes over him, he summons up his Brahmin bearing and 
lowers his voice. "You see," he says softly, "they want to annex Kuwait. They 
want to make it their country." 
</P>
<P>
At this, his son, Nawaf, a sophomore at Princeton University who has not left 
his father's side since their world turned upside down last week, sits up 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
Nawaf is by Saud's side again, this time answering the phone while his father 
talks to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier, in an anteroom, Nawaf, decked out in a double-breasted navy 
blazer, had explained that all he wants to do is return to his country. He says 
he will fight and die if need be for Kuwait, the way the emir's brother did 
during the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of my instincts," he declares in an adolescent's breaking 
voice. "Without a country, I am not a man." 
</P>
<P>
Saud refused to discuss the whereabouts of his wife, Awatif, and three of his 
five children who were in Kuwait during the invasion. "You cannot mention where 
they are," he demands. "They could be in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Nawaf has made a similar demand, explaining only that some of his family -- 
meaning his immediate relatives -- were safe, although others were not. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the ambassador and his family were in New York, en route to 
Kuwait for a month's vacation. But Saud decided at the last minute to stay 
behind. He had read a harsh memo from the foreign minister of Iraq, accusing 
Kuwait of stealing Iraqi land. 
</P>
<P>
Nawaf and his 8-year-old brother, Sabah, returned to Washington with the 
ambassador; a week later, the invasion occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Nawaf was with his father when he got the late-night call that troops were 
three kilometers from the emir's palace. "My father just shook his head and 
called the State Department," Nawaf says. 
</P>
<P>
Saud has been Kuwait's envoy to the United States for a decade. He also has 
served as ambassador to Britain and has worked at the United Nations in New 
York. Educated in British schools and trained as a lawyer in Kuwait, Saud has 
worked and lived in his native land only intermittenly. 
</P>
<P>
Like his father, Nawaf also has lived most of his life away from home. He is 
studying international diplomacy and had hoped to follow in his father's 
footsteps, joining the Kuwaiti foreign service after graduation from Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the son says he would be willing to return to Kuwait and never leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I have many friends there," he says. "Every time I go back, I make new ones. 
Every time I go back, I meet another cousin my age. Our family is just like an 
extension of the whole country. We are all one family, one unit. You cannot 
break us apart." 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, Nawaf has relied on support from other Kuwaitis in America 
and his American friends from St. Albans, an exclusive Washington prep school 
that is his alma mater. His friends have called the embassy daily; some of them 
attended a rally Monday in front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Nawaf says his father put him in charge of fielding calls from the 2,000 or so 
Kuwaiti students in the United States, many in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Father has told them not to worry about their families -- that everyone will 
be all right," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Nawaf, as if by merely raising the possibility that they somehow will not be 
all right and that he might somehow appear disloyal, suddenly turns the 
conversation to Americans and their support of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
He produces a letter that has just arrived over the embassy fax machine from a 
Kentuckian, who writes that Americans love freedom and understand the Kuwaitis' 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world supports us," Nawaf says brightly. 
</P>
<P>
But he darkens when asked about "brother countries" in the Arab world and their 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"People refer to the 'brother country' in Iraq," he observes. "I have no 
relatives there. Right now, I am against all this brotherhood. I think we have 
been betrayed by many of the Arab countries who have not come to our defense." 
</P>
<P>
But his father's diplomatic view is that there are "brother countries who will 
come to our defense. I feel confident that Saudi Arabia will support us," Saud 
says later. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the crisis, it is clear father and son have learned to lean 
more than ever on each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt close to my father," Nawaf says, sounding more boyish as 
his voice softens and he talks of his father and their tennis matches in 
quieter times. "Right now, our relationship has taken on extreme poignancy." 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, a member of the embassy staff interrupts Nawaf to say that his 
father needs to see him. The son promises to return but explains of his 
relationship with his dad: "When he's here, I'm usually always with him. I'm 
always by his side." 
</P>

ACOUSTIC QUARTET MARKS A DECADE OF HARMONIZING; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE 10-YEAR-OLD QUARTET MUSIC PLAYS ITS FIRST LOCAL CONCERT OF THE YEAR 
TONIGHT AT THE LONG BEACH MUSEUM OF ART.

Quartet Music has become one of those groups that comes together when it's 
convenient, said percussionist Alex Cline, and it actually works because the 
ensemble isn't the music of any one or two of its members. 
</P>
<P>
"The group reflects those four people when they play music and it just takes on 
its own life," Cline said. "The compositions they contribute are written 
strictly with the group identity in mind so it dictates its own style. Because 
of that, it will always have a life we can return to -- it isn't something 
we've had difficulty rekindling if we've been away from it for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Quartet Music also includes Jeff Gauthier (violin), Eric von Essen and Nels 
Cline (acoustic guitar) and makes its first local concert appearance this year 
tonight at the Long Beach Museum of Art. It wasn't for lack of trying -- two 
scheduled 10-year anniversary performances earlier this year were canceled due 
to illness and injury. 
</P>
<P>
The group formed when Von Essen and Nels Cline began looking to expand the 
range of their duets in an acoustic framework. Gauthier was recruited from a 
classical orchestra and Alex Cline, who was involved in a number of a 
wide-ranging jazz explorations, rounded out the lineup. The acoustic nature of 
the music forced adjustments on Cline's part. 
</P>
<P>
"It necessitated creating a different set-up of (percussion) instruments that 
would blend well with that instrumentation," said Cline, 34. "We laughingly 
call it an acoustic group because everything has to be miked or you can't play 
with a drum set. With the set-up I have, I can flail away at full intensity and 
not completely overwhelm the band." 
</P>
<P>
Quartet Music isn't Cline's only outlet. Since 1976, the lanky percussionist 
has appeared on more than 30 albums -- mostly on small Los Angeles-based labels 
-- and served as the accompanist/collaborator on many experimental dance 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his ongoing involvement with Quartet Music, pianist Richard 
Grossman's trio and saxophonist Vinny Golia's Quintet and Large Ensemble, Cline 
recently formed his own group and released his debut album for ECM, "The Lamp 
and the Star." Another side of his music will be displayed during the Los 
Angeles Festival when Cline performs a solo percussion concert at 5 p.m. Sept. 
8 in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't played a solo concert in six years so I'm looking forward to it," he 
said. "I used to have a repertoire of solo pieces but after I recorded some in 
1981, I decided I was just going to improvise my solo concerts." 
</P>
<P>
Cline will have no shortage of instruments around to negotiate those musical 
points -- his standard alignment of drums and percussion takes a minimum of two 
hours to assemble. His quest for a broader vocabulary has led him to 
incorporate everyday implements like kitchen pots and wrenches as well as an 
imposing array of chimes, gongs and cymbals. 
</P>
<P>
"When I play solo, there's more focus on the Asian elements of what I'm doing 
with the gongs and bells and singing bowls which fit into their Pacific Rim 
thematic idea," Cline said. "I've always been drawn to rich sounds and the 
Asians for centuries have had the market cornered on high-quality metal 
percussion instruments. The singing bowls and hand bells from the Tibetan 
region, in terms of harmonic range, sustain and sonic richness, are probably 
the best ever made." 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles native, Cline began playing in rock bands with his twin, Nels, in 
the late '60s before gravitating toward jazz behind the influence of drummers 
Tony Williams, Jack DeJohnette and Roy Haynes. The early '70s groups of Herbie 
Hancock, Pharaoh Sanders and the Art Ensemble of Chicago introduced Cline to a 
wider array of percussion sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Now Cline faces the challenge of trying to secure work for his band, not the 
easiest task when the group features an ethereal, evanescent sound that doesn't 
strive for dramatic effect. Some listeners might relegate Cline's music to the 
New Age zone but he rejects the label. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough of a discomfort factor in my music to scare New Age people off 
because they're really looking for background music and that doesn't interest 
me at all," he said. "I like to be moved by music -- I don't need it to be 
sonic incense." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people might think what I do as a solo percussionist is too (New Age-ish) 
because they're not accustomed to hearing one or two bells ringing together as 
enough to listen to in itself . . . but without becoming too Cage-ian, that may 
be something the listener needs to re-evaluate."

Ray Anderson is the most talked-about performer in a sparsely populated field. 
His apparent aim is to play the trombone higher, lower and wilder than anyone 
else, and to bring together the past, present and future of the horn in one 
fell swoop. For his efforts he has earned critical praise and has won the last 
four Down Beat polls. 
</P>
<P>
At 38, the Chicago-born Anderson has worked on avant-garde gigs with Henry 
Threadgill, led a jazz/rock/fusion band called the Slickaphonics that enjoyed 
success in Europe, played rhythm-and-blues and Latin dates around New York, and 
more recently has led an all-purpose quartet that has recorded for Gramavision. 
</P>
<P>
If his playing is outrageous, he has a personality to match it. When he speaks, 
he is Harry Belafonte crossed with the Godfather. When he sings, he is apt to 
break out into multiphonic effects that suggest two Louis Armstrongs. His tall, 
gangling visual image has reminded some observers of a 1940s-style hipster. 
</P>
<P>
Currently on his first visit to the Southland as a leader, he played Monday and 
Tuesday at Elario's in La Jolla; tonight he will be at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill 
in Hollywood and Thursday at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Ave. Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's bizarre technique both vocally and on the horn would seem to have 
been self-taught. "I was the lead vocalist with the Slickaphonics," he recalls, 
"and I developed this strange double sound. A singing coach told me my vocal 
cords were vibrating to produce one note while the skin outside the larynx 
vibrated to produce a second. She said it was an incorrect technique, and I 
should never do it again." He has been using it, of course, ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many American jazz artists, Anderson has enjoyed more success abroad 
than at home. He's been the subject of many feature stories in European jazz 
magazines. Japan, typically, has put out the welcome mat. "I've been there a 
half-dozen times, with various people, and just got back from there this 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
He is not entirely a prophet without domestic honor. True, his Slickaphonic 
sessions were made for European consumption; most were unreleased here. 
However, his more recent albums for Enja and currently for Gramavision have 
been earning five-star ratings, and he has accumulated a pile of laudatory 
clippings hailing his appearances at New York's Village Vangarde. 
</P>
<P>
His best-known album, "What Because," showcased him with what was then his 
regular touring band. At present he has to assemble a group when enough work 
opportunities arise. "There just aren't enough jobs for me to hold a band 
together. I look forward to the time when I won't have to rehearse a new 
personnel for every few gigs. But I'm happy with the people I have right now." 
(Pianist Amina Claudine Myers is a recording artist for RCA, bassist Mark 
Helias also has recorded as a leader, and drummer Dion Parsons on drums 
completes the quartet.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the appearance went by almost unnoticed, he was at Catalina's a couple 
of years ago as a sideman with the International Orchestra led by the Swiss 
composer George Gruntz. Playing in a brass section, however, is his idea of 
nothing to do: "You just sit there a whole evening and get to play one solo. It 
might be fun to have a big band of my own someday, but what I'm doing right now 
is what I really want to do -- be in charge and play what I like." 
</P>
<P>
Proving his point, Anderson then took to the bandstand and, after a few 
explosive warm-up noises, went into a long series of uproarious cadenzas, 
growling and trilling, reaching for notes beyond the blue horizon, plunging to 
the depths, and then, after a premonitory vamp, easing his group into a buoyant 
chorus of a mainstream standard, Duke Ellington's "In a Mellotone." The 
Anderson phenomenon was off and cooking.

HALL RESIGNATION ENDS GLYNDEBOURNE CONFLICT;

<P>
MUSIC: HE WAS AMONG ADVOCATES OF CLASSIC OPERA PITTED AGAINST COMPANY MEMBERS 
WILLING TO EXPERIMENT.

<P>
Sir Peter Hall's weekend resignation as artistic director of Glyndebourne 
Festival Opera has finally ended the bitter backstage bickering that has 
dominated conversation among Britain's opera followers all summer. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the company say advocates of classic opera, including Hall, 
were pitted against those in the company willing to experiment with new works 
and radical re-staging of traditional operas. 
</P>
<P>
A crisis came in May with a highly unconventional Glyndebourne production of 
Mozart's "Die Zauberflote," from Peter Sellars, the director of stage and the 
Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars, 32, cut all the opera's original spoken dialogue, and set it in 
contemporary times -- at an L.A. freeway interchange -- with a cast of 
characters that included beachboys. Reviews were mixed. For the first time in 
the memory of Glyndebourne, a sedate but prestigious festival held in the 
grounds of a magnificent country house, sections of the audience booed. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 59, complained bitterly that he had not been consulted about Sellars' 
production. He said he discovered the decision to omit dialogue two days before 
opening night. 
</P>
<P>
He has been Glyndebourne's artistic director since 1984, and has directed 16 
operas there since 1970 -- including traditional but acclaimed productions of 
Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro," "Don Giovanni" and "Cosi fan Tutte." 
</P>
<P>
One of the preeminent names in British performing arts, Hall founded the Royal 
Shakespeare Company in 1960, and succeeded Sir Laurence Olivier as director of 
Britain's National Theatre in 1973, a post he held for 15 years. He has now 
formed his own production company, and before the controversy had planned to 
quit Glyndebourne after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Hall has pulled back from many of his other opera commitments. The Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera announced Monday that Hall was replaced by David Pountney as 
director of "Elektra" "in order to devote all his energies to his new theater 
company." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Hall said: "Glyndebourne failed to consult me on an important 
artistic matter for which I am seen to be partially publicly responsible." 
</P>
<P>
He had tendered his resignation June 11, and was only making it public now to 
correct "erroneous reports." 
</P>
<P>
"I was not told that all the dialogue had been cut from (the production) until 
two days before the opening night, and then only in passing. I believe that as 
artistic director of Glyndebourne, I should have been party to this crucial 
decision which changed the structure, meaning and rhythm of the work, and is as 
fundamental as re-orchestrating the music." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said of Sellars: "I have admired (his) work in the past and two years ago 
readily endorsed the idea that he should direct 'Die Zauberflote.' I did not 
finally like the production, but that is no reason to resign or fail to support 
an agreed experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to be consulted on so fundamental as matter as the late removal of 
dialogue, however, shows that Glyndebourne now attaches little importance to my 
artistic opinion. I find myself unable to be part of an opera house that puts 
me in the position of endorsing something I knew nothing about." 
</P>
<P>
Hall is now directing a theatrical production for the Chichester Festival and 
was not available to comment. But he stressed he did not regret appointing 
Sellars. "I'm particularly concerned, having spent my life protecting people 
who want to do nutty things, that it might be thought I'm in any way hostile to 
(him)," he told the London Sunday Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Sellars said nothing passed directly between the two 
protagonists: "We're very friendly. I've known him for quite a while and he's 
always been very generous. When the production opened with giant controversy, 
he defended it. 
</P>
<P>
"I gather that Peter had actually wanted to resign for some time, and if this 
came to hand more readily than other excuses, fine. I suspect he may not be 
replaced. From what I understand, it's a position that has come to be 
irrelevant, which seems to be the basis of his complaint." 
</P>
<P>
Hall has successfully straddled the worlds of theater and opera. After leaving 
the National Theatre, he formed his own Peter Hall Company last year and 
promptly staged two hits which made the transatlantic jump to Broadway: 
"Orpheus Descending" with Vanessa Redgrave and "The Merchant of Venice" with 
Dustin Hoffman. Ibsen's "Wild Duck" is now playing in London's West End to good 
reviews and audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this year with Times theater writer Sylvie Drake, Hall 
said: "If somebody said you can't do both (opera and theater) . . . I would do 
theater. But I would do it with a great pang. . . . Everything about my life is 
that I've been able to go from opera to theater and back again. It's like going 
from one mistress to another. It's having two. I do love that." 
</P>
<P>
With the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, he staged his "Salome" in 1986 
(remounted in 1989) and "Marriage of Figaro" earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the internal wrangling at Glyndebourne became public only days 
after Hall gave a candid and widely discussed interview to BBC radio, in which 
he admitted being tough and bullying. "I think some people think I'm terribly 
thick-skinned, arrogant, self-contained and not at all easily hurt," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"I am, my doctor tells me, an adrenaline addict. My system needs . . . and 
produces a lot of adrenalin, therefore I love stress." He added his workaholic 
lifestyle had contributed to the end of his three marriages, one to actress 
Leslie Caron, and another to American soprano Maria Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy over Hall's departure, Sellars' relationship with 
Glyndebourne remains sound. He is set to direct another controversial opera, 
"The Death of Klinghoffer" by American minimalist composer John Adams, which 
deals with the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking. And his "Zauberflote" will be 
performed by Glyndebourne's touring company this fall, and will return to the 
festival next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely flattered that a little thing of mine would be at the center 
of such a brouhaha," Sellars said. "It's ironic, because this ("Die 
Zauberflote") is the sweetest possible thing, all about brotherly love, things 
that nobody could possibly object to." 
</P>
<P>

A LOT OF DORADO; 
</P>
<P>
POPULAR GAME FISH BEING CAUGHT IN RECORD NUMBERS OFF ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning a trip to Baja California, to one of many locations noted for dorado 
fishing? 
</P>
<P>
No need. The acrobatic fish are as thick as can be right here in our own back 
yard. Since appearing in fair numbers off the Orange County coast a week ago, 
the colorful game fish so popular in Mexico have invaded Southern California 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, take Monday aboard the Thunderbird, a 65-foot sportfisher 
operating out of Davey's Locker. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Craig Jacobs departed from the landing Sunday night. His nighttime 
target: the jumbo squid that also have infiltrated Southland waters, not to 
mention a stretch of beach last week along the Orange County coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo squid are a rarity in local waters and provide an interesting change of 
pace with their odd shape and tendency to squirt water and ink. 
</P>
<P>
However, when nocturnal squid fishing didn't work out as expected, Jacobs chose 
to spend the night atop the 267 bank, a popular fishing area about 10 miles off 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was a wise decision. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn, as the sky turned from black to gray, it was time to search for 
floating kelp paddies, beneath which dorado -- another rarity in local waters 
-- have been seen and caught in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long to find a clump of kelp, about 1 1/2 miles south of the 
267. Jacobs pulled alongside the paddy, and the crew began tossing anchovies 
over the side to attract any fish that might be in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers began to fish, and the result was instant chaos. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 fishermen hooked up immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Dorado began leaping, trying to shake the hooks. Free-swimming dorado were 
crashing the surface to feed on bait fish tossed overboard. Still others could 
be seen swimming as far as 50 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Amid brilliant flashes of blue, green and yellow, the action was some of the 
fastest aboard any local boat in years. It went on for three hours, an eternity 
for fishermen involved in any bite. 
</P>
<P>
Between 150 and 200 fish were taken from beneath just one piece of floating 
kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, 23, with 1 1/2 years' experience as captain and 10 more around the 
docks, couldn't believe what he was experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even heard of this happening," he said. "I know during the El Nino 
year (1982-83) there was quite a few (dorado) caught, but nothing like this, 
from what I understand." 
</P>
<P>
He was right. 
</P>
<P>
The last time enough dorado appeared to be called a showing was during the 
warm-water El Nino phenomenon. "But not in these quantities," said Herb Frey, 
an oceanographer with the Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs set out in search of another paddy and found one 1 1/2 miles to the 
southeast. 
</P>
<P>
More chum was tossed over the rail, more lines put out -- and more hungry 
dorado whipped into a feeding frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The 38 fishermen went at it again, battling the fish up and down the rail. 
Lines were tangled and feet stepped on. But nobody was complaining. By 1 p.m., 
the deck of the Thunderbird was littered with dorado -- 380 in all, weighing 
between four and 16 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the vicinity, other boats were still busy catching fish. 
</P>
<P>
The Amigo, of Newport Landing, finished the day with 19 passengers boating 109 
dorado. The Freelance, another of the Davey's Locker fleet, decked 212. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible," said Jeff Long of Huntington Beach, a passenger aboard the 
Thunderbird. "I got 20 dorado. Boy, I got lucky, man. I just picked the right 
day at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
He may not be so lucky when the DFG informs him that there is a 10-fish limit 
for dorado. Maybe he released the other 10. 
</P>
<P>
Said Captain Mike Thompson of the Amigo: "I figured if we got 10 or 20 of them 
we'd be happy. But there's a tremendous volume of fish out there." 
</P>
<P>
Dorado, or mahi mahi as they are known in Hawaii, have been present in local 
waters -- primarily those off southern Orange County beaches -- for about three 
weeks, but have been included only sporadically in the fish counts until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been several days when we've seen 200 or 300 fish under a kelp 
paddy, throwing bait at them, and had them not bite a thing," said Julie Yates, 
a reservations clerk at Newport Landing. "We tried everything and they wouldn't 
bite." 
</P>
<P>
Divers, on the other hand, have found the game fish easy targets for their 
high-powered spear guns and have been targeting them regularly for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Divers first noticed -- and began spearing -- the dorado about a month ago off 
Dana Point," said Jay Riffe, a spear-gun manufacturer and member of the Long 
Beach Neptunes Dive Club. "Since then, they have been getting them every 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Riffe, who once held the world record for a spear-shot dorado, said they make 
easy targets because of their curiosity toward divers and their broad profile. 
</P>
<P>
Because catches among sportfishers were not constant, and the eight- to 12-mile 
boat rides left little time for alternative fishing, dorado were not heavily 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
That changed in a hurry when word spread of Monday's explosion. And Tuesday, 
the bite showed no signs of slowing. The Western Pride, a half-day boat out of 
Davey's Locker, had 87 dorado by noon. Other boats were reporting similar 
success. 
</P>
<P>
The normally quiet landings of Orange County are so no longer. Fishermen are 
inquiring if all they are hearing is true, and if it is, how can they get in on 
the action. 
</P>
<P>
"People hear there are exotics in the area and they go nuts," said Eddie 
DiRuscio, manager of Davey's Locker. 
</P>
<P>
"It has not stopped, I've been on (the phone) all day," said Julie Yates, a 
reservations clerk at Newport Landing. "I haven't done any of the stuff I'm 
supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's boat holds 48 passengers. He figures to carry a full load for quite 
a while, as do captains from San Pedro to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons dorado have migrated well north of their habitat -- tropical and 
subtropical waters -- are not difficult to explain, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Dotson, a migratory species expert with the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, said last week that the lack of prolonged westerly winds in recent 
weeks has served to warm the surface temperature four or five degrees above 
normal. Dorado are surface feeders and have merely followed the warm water 
north. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all warm-water lovers," Frey said of the dorado and jumbo squid. 
"We've had about five or six weeks where we had this hot, humid weather, 
bringing this warm water up. And along with this, we've had a very good 
recruitment year for sardines . . . There's a lot of different factors, and all 
of them look very, very good." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and other skippers, meanwhile, credit successive tropical storms and 
hurricanes off Cabo San Lucas in the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently some of the fish moved up this side of the peninsula and, with all 
the surge of warm water we had from the chubascos down below, they just moved 
up the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it's no secret that dorado are here. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin kelp paddies are becoming increasingly rare. Private boaters are 
becoming the enemies of commercial sportfishing captains by infringing on the 
larger boats' territory. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not even finding their own paddies," Jacobs said. "They're following 
us around instead." 
</P>
<P>
Spear fishermen are doing their thing in evening when most fishing boats have 
returned to port, for fear of being run over. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a war out there," Riffe said. "A few dorado . . . I don't believe 
what it's done to everybody." 
</P>

LOTS OF FAMOUS PLAYERS, NO CANOPY MARK FAME INDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They stood outside -- the few, the wet, the brave. They were lined up at 
Cooperstown High School under bright orange Baltimore Orioles umbrellas in the 
hope of seeing Jim Palmer made bronze. These folks had made the pilgrimage from 
Baltimore to share a piece of history with a local hero, and all they shared 
instead were gloomy skies. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend was a fiasco, to put it kindly. The people who run the Hall of 
Fame, an indoors museum, had apparently never considered the possibility of 
rain at an outdoors event. A canopy, to cover the dais and protect the 
speakers, would have saved the day, but this low-tech solution seemed to elude 
those in charge. It was said, though never confirmed, that erecting a canopy 
would have violated village zoning laws. Can you imagine the police raid that 
might have followed? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, there was no canopy Sunday, when the ceremonies were scheduled, and 
many people, at least those with jobs, had to leave town. For those who stayed 
and weren't one kind of VIP or another, it meant hours in the rain outside the 
school awaiting Palmer's induction, which was broadcast over loudspeakers to 
what would be described as a remarkably friendly, if damp, crowd of about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Regular folks -- just fans, you understand -- couldn't get inside but they were 
treated to more than simply the amplified strains of history. There was also 
this delicious irony: The rain stopped almost as soon as the ceremonies began. 
</P>
<P>
For the 700 fortunates who crowded into the school auditorium, the day went as 
expected. There were many tears. Palmer, the original emotional boy, began 
crying during Joe Morgan's speech. Morgan, who also cried, made a moving 
speech, full of wonder and appreciation for what he had accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
It was harder to say what Palmer's talk was about, except that it was about 
everything. You have to understand Palmer and his remarkable mind, which will 
wander from subject to subject, much like a jazz riff dancing lightly from note 
to note. He is a rambling man, who never could focus on any single object for 
long, unless it was a catcher's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
But when he got to the end of his tearstained speech, Palmer would finally 
explain why all the people had come in the first place. As corny as it may 
sound, and, in fact, as corny as it may be, baseball's appeal is based on the 
idea of a continuum. Nowhere is that concept more fully realized than at the 
Hall of Fame, where Babe Ruth is as alive as Willie Mays, who is as current as 
Jose Canseco. The game, for whatever reason, is in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I tried to be as good as I was, was because of what the gentlemen 
behind me were able to do," Palmer said. "The fact that Warren Spahn won 363 
games. ... I wasn't left-handed, so I was going to be another Bob Feller or Don 
Drysdale. That's what baseball is all about, to grow up as a kid in New York, 
being a Yankee fan -- which proves nobody is perfect -- to dream about pitching 
against Mickey Mantle or Roger Maris, guys I did have a chance to pitch 
against. Then to be one of them is something I never thought I'd have a chance 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who called himself a baseball traditionalist, understood. He had 
already said, "No matter how long I'm in the Hall of Fame, I'll never be able 
to say Mays, Musial and Morgan in the same breath." 
</P>
<P>
To Morgan, Mays and Stan Musial are heroes, as much as they are to you and me. 
Musial, Spahn and Feller were among the 20 Hall of Famers who sat behind Morgan 
and Palmer, smiling as fathers might. A record 32 Hall of Famers had shown up 
for the affair, but a dozen left after the delay. They were missed. They all 
meant something. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the weekend for both inductees was the dinner Sunday night in 
which the old Hall of Famers welcomed the new. That's when they began to 
understand that they, too, truly belonged. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really get in touch with it until the dinner," Palmer said. "The most 
poignant moment was Ted Williams standing up and saying how happy he was to see 
so many of his friends healthy and able to be here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to talk about the Hall of Fame without sounding like you're 
gloating. These guys had .331 lifetime batting averages. They expected to hit 
.330. That's what kind of players they were. And they came here because they 
care about each other." 
</P>
<P>
This feeling of fraternity is understandable. What's funny is that, almost 
immediately, these two former players, only five years retired, became old-time 
wardens of the game. Both cried out for standards. Both worried that money 
would spoil the game, even as Musial and Williams had worried that money would 
ruin the game Morgan and Palmer played. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice for the players of today," Morgan said, "is despite the distractions 
of big money and media pressure, to practice your craft and to enjoy every 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who complained each year of his career that he was underpaid, said 
players should not use money as a motivational factor. The important thing, he 
said, was to have the desire to excel. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many modern players do have that same desire or they don't succeed. 
If big money has changed the game, it has not done so in any substantial way. 
In 10 years or in 50, people will still troop to this little village to honor 
new heroes. Maybe by then, they will have scared up a canopy.

BLYLEVEN IS THANKFUL FAMILY WASN'T HURT MORE SERIOUSLY 
</P>

The photos, piled carelessly on a canvas chair in front of Bert Blyleven's 
locker, bore mute testimony to his chilling description of the traffic accident 
in which his wife, daughter and two sons were injured last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very lucky to have them back," Blyleven said of his family. 
</P>
<P>
A van, driven by Blyleven's wife, Patty, hurtled about 160 feet through the air 
and turned over several times on a road near Lone Pine as the family returned 
from watching Blyleven's eldest son, Todd, pitch in a tournament. Patty 
Blyleven suffered head injuries, cuts and bruises and Kimberley, 16, had 
several smashed toes. Both were in the front seat, wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
Tim, 8, was able to go home with his father that night, but 6-year-old Tom, who 
was thrown from the vehicle, suffered broken arms. The boys were lying in the 
back of the van and were not wearing seat belts. All were released from area 
hospitals last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the photos again and again, seeing the smashed side of the white van 
and its dented roof, Blyleven could only repeat how grateful he is that his 
family was spared more serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I went (to the accident scene) that night because my son (Tom) wanted his 
blanket," he said. "We took a flashlight and poked around and found it and I 
was able to get it to him at the hospital. . . . The tow-truck driver said he'd 
seen people turn over like that and not come out alive. I'm very lucky they 
came out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who was excused from pitching last Saturday so he could be with his 
family, threw in the bullpen Tuesday for the first time since the accident. 
Pitching coach Marcel Lachemann said Blyleven -- who had not missed a turn 
since September, 1983 -- would take his normal turn Friday, when the Angels 
will play Baltimore at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Grahe, who was called from triple-A Edmonton to start Saturday's game, 
remained with the Angels and was available Tuesday for long relief duties.

MAVERICK COACH GIVES PROTEGES THE ADVANTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: CHARLIE DIMARCO FORMED HIS OWN CLUB TO ENSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 
OF ATHLETES WOULD BE MET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The promise of a vaulting pole of his choice lured Charlie DiMarco into 
becoming a track coach 11 years ago, but it is the promise of young athletes 
that is keeping him in his chosen profession. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, disenchanted with what he claimed were numerous restrictions at 
the college coaching level, especially his inability to work with high school 
athletes because of NCAA regulations, DiMarco, 31, resigned as the field events 
coach at Cal State Northridge and started the Advantage Athletics track club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enjoyable when you have to fight the political battles of satisfying 
someone's ego," said DiMarco, who lives in Northridge and still works 
independently with several CSUN athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"What motivates me is to see athletes have the opportunity to reach their 
potential, but that's not always the No. 1 priority with athletic directors. 
</P>
<P>
"All they understand is if the team wins or loses. They don't understand if a 
kid sets a personal best or a school record. 
</P>
<P>
"In track, the bottom line is personal achievement." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco, a full-time employee at On Track, a track and field equipment 
distributor and manufacturer in Glendale, donates his time year-round after 
work and on weekends to help athletes fulfill their potential. In addition, he 
says he provides insurance liability for the club out of his own pocket. There 
are no membership dues and schools for which the athletes compete underwrite 
travel expenses. In rare instances, the athlete himself will pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do it for money because I don't want to put up with the politics of 
being on a high school or college staff," said DiMarco, who likens Advantage 
Athletics to gymnastics and swimming clubs in that the emphasis is placed on 
individual development. "I want to do it for the enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"I get satisfaction as long as someone is improving. I don't have to have the 
top athletes or Olympians." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several athletes have left their mark, literally, under the 
tutelage of DiMarco. Crissy Mills of USC and Campbell Hall High, Walt Stewart 
of CSUN and Melanie Clarke of Valley College all have won significant 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Mills won the girls' high jump in the 1988 and '89 state high school 
championships, prevailing with marks of 5 feet 10 inches and 6-0. Stewart won 
the 1989 NCAA Division II title in the men's high jump (7-0 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who also trains with Valley Coach James Harvey, won the heptathlon in 
the state junior college championships in May and in The Athletics Congress 
junior nationals in June (5,034 points and 5,080). 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who graduated from Notre Dame High, heard about DiMarco's 
individualized training methods and chose to attend Northridge on a partial 
scholarship in 1985 despite the offer of a full ride from Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"I was primarily self-coached in high school," said Stewart, who has a personal 
best of 7-2 1/2 and is still training with DiMarco. "I jumped 6-8 in high 
school, but I still needed help. I really liked the idea of a coach to work one 
to one. I improved four inches in my first year and that's a lot at my level." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who threw 71 feet in the javelin in her first heptathlon in April 
improved to 121-1 in her third heptathlon, in the TAC Junior meet. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really helped me, not only with my technique but (with) what I need to 
focus on before the throw," said Clarke, the woman athlete of the year in field 
events in the Western State Conference. "He's a generous man and loves track. 
He's out there every day and (he is) a great motivator." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stephens, winner of the javelin in the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials, was 
another DiMarco protege at CSUN. Stephens found DiMarco's methods to be sound, 
so much so that in 1984 he won the NCAA Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll take you step by step and show you what to do. . . . That makes things a 
lot easier to understand. He knows the dynamics of throws . . . and how to use 
the stronger muscles to avoid injury." 
</P>
<P>
As much as DiMarco wants to help the athletes who solicit his help, the demands 
placed on his time could eventually limit his effectiveness as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a tendency to take on more than I can handle. I'm just about maxed 
out," said DiMarco, who works daily with nine athletes individually and has 16 
in the club. "If I take any more, it doesn't allow me time to give 100%. I 
can't add people indiscriminately and build my club so big that it can't be a 
hands-on club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not in my personality to turn people away empty-handed, either. I try to 
give them advice or steer them toward an age-group club or a masters club." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco said Advantage Athletics would not have been possible without the 
assistance and support of CSUN track Coach Don Strametz, who allows the club to 
use the Northridge track and weight room facilities. In exchange, DiMarco 
renders his services to the CSUN track program. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely wouldn't be here without him. Strametz pushed through the 
paperwork with the school and got us going," DiMarco said. "He has made the 
facilities available to us and gives us the run of the place every evening." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco, a pole vaulter at Marshall High and Valley College, became 
disillusioned with collegiate track after attending San Jose State for a 
quarter in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't very good and I was looking for help and nobody wanted to (help)," 
said DiMarco, who set a personal best of 14-10 in 1980 while serving as an 
assistant coach at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"They were only interested in the big top guns. I felt that I could be decent, 
but I didn't find a coaching staff that was willing to work with me." 
</P>
<P>
He decided to drop intercollegiate track and complete his degree in television 
broadcasting at Cal State Los Angeles. He got his degree but missed the sport 
and wanted to get back into it. 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco started coaching in 1979 at Valley College as an assistant to Mark 
Covert, currently the track and cross-country coach at Antelope Valley Junior 
College. Covert, the NCAA Division II cross-country champion at Cal State 
Fullerton in 1970, was unable to put DiMarco on salary for his first season but 
dangled another enticement. 
</P>
<P>
"(Covert) was a distance runner and he didn't know anything about vaulting," 
DiMarco said. "He was honest about it and said that if I helped him out that 
he'd get me any pole I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco got the pole of his choice. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, DiMarco's first coaching breakthrough came not in the pole vault 
but in the high jump. Sue Patterson, who jumped 4-10 at St. Genevieve High and 
has since improved to 6-1, placed second in the state junior college meet while 
competing for Valley College in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Both coach and athlete apparently took their relationship and accomplishments 
to heart. DiMarco and Patterson, 27, were married in April. 
</P>
<P>
At CSUN, Patterson was a three-time NCAA Division II All-American, twice in the 
high jump (1985 and '86) and once in the heptathlon ('85). 
</P>
<P>
"By coaching good athletes, I've learned a lot," said DiMarco, who coached at 
Valley and CSUN during the 1984 season, then solely at Northridge the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a two-way exchange, an equal partnership. I don't teach down to athletes. 
I'm at an even level. I learn from them and what they get out (of it) is what 
they give. If they give 100%, they get 100% back. If they give me anything 
less, they get shown to the gate." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stewart: "He's looking for the serious athlete that wants help. He's very 
committed to what he does and expects the same in return." 
</P>
<P>
Leaning on his experiences, DiMarco has designed and marketed several products, 
including a foam rubber practice bar for the high jump and pole vault and an 
elastic cord that is tied to one end of the javelin and the other to a post for 
working on technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't plan on coaching forever," said DiMarco, who eventually would like to 
handle the club's administrative duties and relinquish the coaching chores to 
some of his athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of every season, I tell myself that this will be the year that I 
get out and do something else. But every year the athletes get better and 
better and keep going higher, and I tell myself one more year. This year I 
didn't feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are still tired from the season, but right now I'm revved up and 
ready to go."

Oil price -- A story in Tuesday's Business section incorrectly stated the 
all-time high price for crude oil. Crude oil futures prices reached their peak 
at $32.35 a barrel on Aug. 2, 1983, in trading on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, the exchange reported. On the cash market, West Texas Intermediate, 
the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil, peaked at $39.80 a barrel on March 29, 
1980, according to Peter Beutel, a trader at Merrill Lynch Futures.

<P>
In a courtroom filled with tension and taunts between rival factions, two Santa 
Ana men were convicted of double murder Tuesday in Orange County's worst gang 
incident, which left a 4-year-old boy and a teen-ager dead and six people 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
A separate jury, sitting in on the same trial, deadlocked earlier in the day on 
murder verdicts for a third defendant -- identified as one of the triggermen. 
But that jury convicted him on a single count of murder conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sept. 16, 1989, shootings on La Bonita Avenue in Garden Grove 
brought a public outcry against gang violence, the killings have increased. A 
record 19 gang-related homicides have occurred so far this year, far ahead of 
last year's record-setting 16 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim the La Bonita Avenue shooting was a 5th Street gang 
retaliation against the 17th Street gang because of an earlier incident in 
which a nephew of one of the defendants was a victim. 
</P>
<P>
Just after dark, a pickup truck with two young men in the back drove slowly 
past a group of people gathered in cars and on the street in the block just 
north of 17th Street. Suddenly, they opened fire with semiautomatic rifles and 
shot at random toward the small crowd. Killed were Frankie Fernandez Jr., the 
4-year-old, who was sitting with his family in a car waiting to go to the 
movies, and Miguel (Smokey) Navarro, 17, who had been talking with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Among those wounded were Frankie Jr.'s 2-year-old brother and a young man whose 
wounds were so severe that his leg had to be amputated. Navarro was considered 
a primary target because of his involvement with the 17th Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
The Fernandez family and friends, many of them admitted 17th Street gang 
members or former gang members, cheered and clapped when Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Thomas Avdeef came out of the courtroom after the verdicts. But he answered 
them somberly. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is a message to all gang members," Avdeef said. "There are other 
things we can do with our lives without going around shooting one another. I 
hope you have all learned a lesson; stay on the good side of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef later said the main message to gang members is: "If you go around doing 
these kinds of things, you're going to be put away for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
Louis P. Valadez, 28, and Robert P. Figueroa, 20, now face automatic sentences 
of life without parole for their double-murder convictions. They were also 
convicted on multiple counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Roman G. Menchaca, 19, faces 25 years to life for conspiracy to commit murder. 
He was the only defendant who attempted to provide an alibi for his whereabouts 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
When the Valadez-Figueroa verdicts were announced Tuesday, Irene Fernandez, 
Frankie Jr.'s mother, broke into tears and collapsed into the arms of a cousin. 
But seated across the room, the mother of defendant Figueroa, Isabel Figueroa, 
shouted to the other side: "Damned liars! Child molester!" 
</P>
<P>
The "liars" was aimed at three young women who were victims of the La Bonita 
Avenue shooting and who identified the defendants as their assailants. The 
other taunt was for Ralph Rodriguez, a key figure in the case who once was 
convicted of child molestation. It was Rodriguez who first encouraged the young 
women in the 17th Street gang to cooperate with the police. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Rodriguez shouted back at Isabel Figueroa: "That's OK, 
he (her son) is going to rot in jail the rest of his life!" 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen deputies moved in to separate some of the spectators in the 
hallway when taunts between the two factions heated up. The defendants' 
families and friends were ushered into a separate courtroom until the victims' 
family and friends had left the building. The deputies had their hands full; in 
some cases they could only identify the factions by asking, "Are you 5th Street 
or 17th Street?" 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a gang member," answered one man resentfully. "I am with the 
Fernandez family." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, during the reading of the verdicts, Valadez's young wife, 
Leeza, sat in tears, with her face turned to the wall. She later had to be 
helped outside. 
</P>
<P>
Valadez's attorney, David A. Zimmerman, said he was outraged by his client's 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a single, credible eyewitness who saw Louis there," Zimmerman 
said. "But look at this crime. You couldn't have a more vicious crime. It only 
took a stitch of evidence for a jury to convict anyone put on trial here." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa's attorney, Julian W. Bailey, echoed the sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so emotional; all a jury had to do was see gang members sitting in 
front of them and you'd have a conviction," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Menchaca fared better than the other defendants -- with a mistrial on 
the murders, he avoided facing a life-without-parole sentence -- his attorney, 
C. Thomas McDonald, said he was "stunned" that his client was not acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
"The influence of the fact that Roman was associated with the 5th Street gang 
colored all perceptions," McDonald said. "All during the trial, I felt I was 
fighting an (undeclared) charge -- the onus of being associated with 5th 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy also arrested as one of the gunmen is still awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
One of the prosecution witnesses who faced stiff cross-examination on the 
witness stand said afterward that she was glad she had come forward, breaking 
"the code of silence" among gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real happy right now," said Inez Fernandez, who is related to one of the 
victims. "Now, maybe my nephew can rest in peace and they (the defendants) can 
rot in hell." 
</P>
<P>
The dead child's father, Frank Fernandez Sr., was stoic when the verdicts were 
read. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't do any good," he said. "I still don't have my son. Maybe in a while 
it will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Irene, who turned 24 Tuesday and is three months' pregnant, said the 
outcome of the trial should encourage other witnesses to gang violence to speak 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should be afraid to come forward," she said. 
</P>

O.C. MOTORISTS BLAME BIG OIL FOR 10-CENT AVERAGE RISE IN GAS PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a congressional hearing in Washington on Tuesday, a Nevada senator said the 
American public is "mad as hell" at sharply rising gasoline prices. In Orange 
County, consumers were indeed mad, but they weren't the least bit surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists interviewed at gas pumps Tuesday said they expected the nation's oil 
companies to take advantage of the Middle East crisis by convincing consumers 
that oil supplies are dwindling. But motorist Franco Ferretti was not buying 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil companies are not overcharging the people -- they're ripping off the 
people," Ferretti, a Huntington Beach resident, said as he filled his pickup at 
a Costa Mesa Shell station. "This whole thing in the Middle East looks like a 
setup on the part of the oil companies to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ferretti said his two-mile daily commute means that the price increase will 
have only a negligible effect on his income. Not so for commuter Danny Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
"I commute from Mission Viejo to Huntington Beach every day," Palmer said. "I 
have a Chevy truck that holds 20 to 25 gallons, so I'm going to notice it." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer and other South County residents are going to notice the price increase 
a bit more than other county consumers, according to a random survey conducted 
by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 21 stations revealed an average price of $1.25 for a gallon of 
unleaded gasoline Tuesday at self-serve pumps in South County stations; the 
average price in Central County was $1.20 a gallon, about $1.23 in North 
County. In all regions, prices were up since July 31 an average of 10 cents a 
gallon -- including a new 5-cent-per-gallon surcharge levied by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were even higher for premium unleaded and diesel fuel. Premium prices 
soared past $1.40 a gallon at some stations, and diesel fuel prices were up as 
much as 8 cents a gallons since the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is outrageous," said Jodi Holland, a Huntington Beach resident, 
while her diesel-fueled Mercedes-Benz was being filled at a Huntington Beach 
Texaco station. "I have to mortgage my house so I can pay the credit card 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
The Times survey also showed that prices in the same parts of the county varied 
by up to 11 cents a gallon among gas stations. Jim Daskal, general counsel and 
director of government relations for the Washington-based Service Station 
Dealers of America, attributed the disparity to wild price fluctuations over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"With prices changing almost hourly. . . . you have situations where 10 dealers 
of the same brand could pay six different (wholesale) prices," Daskal said. "It 
depends on when they bought it. Over the weekend, we saw some 7- or 8-cent 
differences between ordering on Sunday evening or Monday morning." 
</P>
<P>
Daskal said service station owners have reported that the western states, 
including California, have been hit hardest by the increases, which he said 
"makes absolutely no sense, considering most of the crude sold in the Southland 
is coming from Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increases, Daskal said, his organization has received few reports 
of consumers directing their anger toward station owners, who contend that they 
are making little profit while the oil companies are raking in millions. 
</P>
<P>
"The customers have been in this situation before, and they expect things like 
this to happen," said Avo Asyan, owner of Avo's Shell in Costa Mesa. "We don't 
control the prices. The oil companies and the suppliers control the prices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GASOLINE PRICES AT VARIOUS O.C. LOCATIONS 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices in Orange County have increased an average of 10 in the past 
week, due to both the crisis in the Middle East and a 5 state tax hike that 
took effect last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are for one gallon of self-serve, unleaded gasoline paid for with cash. 
They are rounded up to the nearest penny.

Photo, Explosive Price Hikes: Fuel prices in Orange County were up as much as 8 
cents a gallon since the weekend. Congress has condemned the skyrocketing 
prices and called on President Bush to pressure the big oil companies into a 
rollback. Motorists interviewed at local gas pumps were indeed mad, but not the 
least bit surprised by the price hikes. Above, Max Luxemberg, owner of Mac's 
Texaco in Huntington Beach. Prices in that area were averaging $1.23 per 
gallon. ; Photo, Franco Ferretti of Huntington Beach says, "The oil companies

LEMUEL C. SHEPHERD JR., 94; EX-MARINE COMMANDANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr., who fought in three wars during his 42 years of Marine 
Corps service and then became the corps' commandant and only four-star general, 
died Monday in San Diego at the age of 94. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd attended Virginia Military Institute and was commissioned a second 
lieutenant in the Marines in May, 1917. Soon he was on his way to France as 
part of the 5th Marine Regiment. 
</P>
<P>
He fought in two World War I campaigns, the Chateau-Thierry and Belleau Wood 
battles, and was twice wounded. He was decorated with the Distinguished Service 
Cross, the Navy Cross and the French Croix de Guerre. 
</P>
<P>
Between the world wars, Shepherd held a number of assignments, including White 
House aide-de-camp, commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the 
battleship Idaho with U.S. forces then serving in Haiti, and at the Naval War 
College. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of World War II, then-Col. Shepherd organized and trained the 
9th Marine Regiment, which became part of the 3rd Marine Division. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, he was promoted to brigadier general and became assistant commander of 
the 1st Marine Division, taking part in the South Pacific campaigns at Cape 
Gloucester and New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
In 1944, he took command of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade that spearheaded 
the recapture of Guam from Japanese forces. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd was then promoted to major general and led the newly organized 6th 
Marine Division during the battle for Okinawa. At the end of the war, he took 
the division to Tsingtao, China, where he accepted the surrender of Japanese 
forces in the region. 
</P>
<P>
When the Korean War began, Shepherd was commanding general of the Fleet Marine 
Force, Pacific, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. He participated in the Marine landing 
at Inchon, Korea, and in the evacuation of Marines from Hungnam after the 
Marine retreat from the Chosin Reservoir when Chinese troops entered the war. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd became commandant, the Marines' only four-star general, on Jan. 1, 
1952, and was the first commandant to become a member of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after his 1956 retirement, Shepherd was recalled to active duty to 
serve as the chairman of the Inter-American Defense Board, a post he held for 3 
1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd is survived by sons Lemuel C. Shepherd III, a retired Marine colonel, 
and Wilson E. D. Shepherd, also a former Marine officer, and daughter Virginia 
Ord, wife of a retired Marine colonel. 
</P>
<P>
He will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

DIANNE KLEIN: AS THE MEDICAL WOUND FESTERS, THE POOR KEEP COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last Saturday in July was a pretty typical day in Santa Ana. Sticky hot. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall it had cooled a bit -- there was even a hint of a breeze -- but 
Irma Garcia was having trouble keeping an even keel. The physical pain of 
childbirth, rhythmic, merciless, was pulling at her strength, draining what 
little she had left. 
</P>
<P>
She'd already been to UCI Medical Center, where somebody had told her they'd be 
able to help, but she was turned away. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has been doing that, on and off, for more than a year. "Diversion" 
is what they call it. "Please go somewhere else" is what it means. 
</P>
<P>
Officials there say they don't like it, but economics and demographics have 
forced their hand. Too many women are giving birth, too few of them are able to 
pay. That means not enough labor rooms, not enough beds and not enough 
obstetricians willing to take a risk on helping those with nowhere else to 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
MediCal isn't working as its planners had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
So Irma Garcia went to a hospital closer to home, with the pain clawing at her 
from the inside. Nurse Catherine Maxey reports that the first time she saw her, 
Irma was on her side, clutching at the rail of her bed, in a labor room. 
</P>
<P>
A fetal monitor was strapped around her belly. An I.V. ran from her arm. Irma's 
eyes were wide. Her breath, heavy, caught as the contractions wracked her, the 
internal explosions that were heralding new life. 
</P>
<P>
The obstetrician, though, had other concerns circling his mind. Tired and 
angry, he'd seen a lot of "Irmas" before. Their names, really, were 
interchangeble. These were strangers who were taking up his time. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't speak Irma's language, Spanish, and because of that, nurse Maxey had 
been summoned to his side. After three years as a public health nurse in Santa 
Ana, she had picked up the Spanish she heard spoken at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
This is Catherine Maxey's recollection of what went on that night. The doctor 
declined to speak to me. 
</P>
<P>
Irma told Catherine that she had had no prenatal medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask her why!" the doctor said, barking his command. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine stared, at the doctor, then at Irma. She was holding her hand. When a 
contraction subsided, she relayed the doctor's demand. 
</P>
<P>
Irma said that she had felt fine. Doctors were for the ill. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask her why she didn't go to UCI hospital!" the doctor said. "Why here?" 
</P>
<P>
Irma told Catherine why. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," the doctor said, impatient. His eyes flashed at the nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell her that we won't accept her either," he said. Then he winked. A little 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell her that!" 
</P>
<P>
But Catherine said that she would not. 
</P>
<P>
Now Catherine, too, was angry; her weariness was showing through. Yes, the 
names of these patients are interchangeable. The refrain, on the floor, seems 
always put to the same tune. She could hear it, now, running through her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 These people... These people.... Oh, these people always have MediCal. Never 
pay a dime. Our hard earned money goes to taxes, to pay for them.... Did you 
know that half the census tonight in the hospital is OB and yet this department 
loses money?... Oh, these people know English. Just play dumb till the baby's 
out, and then they can speak just fine.... These people.... These people. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the doctor broke Catherine's train of thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell her that she's stupid to have never seen a doctor," he said. "Tell her 
that just yesterday a woman came in and had a dead baby. Tell her that!" 
</P>
<P>
"I won't tell her that," Catherine snapped. "Why tell her now? She won't 
understand. How can she listen now. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, they can listen now," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
"After the baby's out, they won't listen anymore. I want them to know that they 
can't not take care of themselves during their pregnancy, never see a doctor, 
and think that they can just walk into any hospital and be received with open 
arms. Do you understand the risk I take to deliver a baby blind like this?" 
</P>
<P>
Catherine understands, and so do I. This doctor is one of the comparatively few 
in Orange County who treat poor pregnant women, many of them who walk in off 
the street only when it is time to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
For most obstetricians, the risks -- of a malpractice lawsuit if something goes 
wrong and a paltry, late MediCal payment to boot -- are simply too high. The 
latest survey in Orange County showed that less than 35% of area obstetricians 
will accept a patient on MediCal. 
</P>
<P>
And this comes at a time when births are booming -- an official 12% countywide 
increase from 1988 to 1989 -- with no immediate end in sight. The percentage of 
indigent patients, meantime, is on the rise. Government funding continues its 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
"I still accept MediCal, though they don't pay me beans," the doctor told 
Catherine. "I deliver these people, with the risk to be sued every time. I do 
this! Yet do I ever get thanks? I get nothing. I'm tired tonight. I had to 
leave my family again; my daughter cried. So I'm not going to tell this woman, 
'Oh wonderful that you have come here.' 
</P>
<P>
"Ask her if she's applied for MediCal," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
The nurse did, and the answer came that she had applied two weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
But this really mattered little, just then. The law says MediCal will reimburse 
delivery charges for families with no way to pay. The payment, however, is 
rarely enough. The medical establishment, and advocates for the poor, are fed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Task forces have been formed. Calls for solutions -- more money, prenatal care, 
hospital beds, doctors, family planning, and the list goes on and on -- abound. 
Frustration and anger are rife. 
</P>
<P>
It shows, in the words and expressions, of everybody concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the labor room, the doctor left to prepare for the delivery of Irma's 
child. Nurse Maxey, bending over the patient, was angry, confused, and on the 
verge of tears. 
</P>
<P>
"You are doing so well," she told Irma. "The time is very near." 
</P>
<P>
Irma squeezed Catherine's hand. Her contraction was debilitating and she let 
out her first little scream. Within minutes after that, Irma's son, wailing, 
strong and healthy, a U.S. citizen, arrived in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I tried to visit this new mother at her home, but the address that she 
gave the hospital did not exist. This happens a lot. 
</P>
<P>
So perhaps the name Irma Garcia, too, is just a private myth. I don't know. It 
certainly wouldn't be the first time. 
</P>
<P>
But the story of this indigent mother, ubiquitous, with the interchangeable 
names, is all too real. It's as typical as a hot, sticky day at the end of 
July.

TESTS CONDUCTED FOR MARROW TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hanh Truong's well-wishers lined up like lottery players Tuesday, each baring a 
vein on the 1-in-100,000 chance that the young man could be kept alive. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old computer programmer is suffering from acute lymphocytic 
leukemia, a bone-marrow cancer. He has been given only a 30% chance of survival 
unless he receives a bone-marrow transplant within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
But finding a bone-marrow donor is proving a particularly thorny problem for 
the Vietnamese-born Truong because his relatives have proven to be incompatible 
and the pool of possible Vietnamese donors in the United States is so small. 
</P>
<P>
To survive, Truong must battle not only the medical odds but a traditional 
reluctance among many Southeast Asians to give blood -- or to go on television 
or even around the neighborhood to ask strangers to give bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, when the doctor told me I had to go back to my community to start a 
blood drive. . . , I was very reluctant," Truong said. "It was hard, because 
being Asian, you keep everything to yourself, you deal with it in the family. 
You don't come out and say, 'I'm sick and need help.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Truong said he now hopes that going public with his own plight may help 
other leukemia victims who are dying in silence. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three friends who say they know someone who has leukemia. . . . They 
don't come out and ask for help. So they die instead of saying something," 
Truong said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this event does not come up with bone marrow for me, I hope it will 
find a match for somebody else," he said. "That would be the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's drive was held at Cal State Fullerton, Truong's alma mater, and 
sponsored by the Covina-based Life-Savers Foundation of America. Family and 
friends had also distributed 20,000 leaflets in Orange County's Vietnamese 
community in hopes of attracting more Asian donors. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 170 people from the college and the community had dropped by for 
testing. Life-Savers data banks contain information on 107,000 potential 
bone-marrow donors nationwide, but only about 4% of them are Asian, and perhaps 
only 1% Vietnamese, said Charles E. Pruitt, donor-recruitment manager for 
Life-Savers. 
</P>
<P>
Siblings offer the best chance of being able to donate bone marrow, with the 
odds of a match averaging about one in four or five, Pruitt said. Outside one's 
family -- but within one's own ethnic group -- the odds drop to 1 in 20,000. 
Though interracial bone-marrow transplants are not impossible, the odds plunge 
to 1 in 100,000 -- hence the need to sign up more potential minority donors, 
Pruitt said.

"What motivates me, keeps me going, is, I'm not doing this just for me," he

die. The best thing (is) if today they can come up with a match for somebody 
else." SONNI EFRON

OFFICERS SMOKE OUT SUSPECTS BUT GET SICK

Two burglary suspects and three police officers became ill from inhaling toxic 
pesticides late Monday night after the suspects were found hiding under a tent 
that blanketed a condominium complex being fumigated for termites. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jim Woods said police received a call at 9:40 p.m. from a resident who told 
them that three men were seen going in and out of the six-unit Edgewood Drive 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Police found that three condominiums had been broken into, with belongings 
piled outside the units. They also found a gas mask outside the tent. 
</P>
<P>
One of the officers then saw three men trying to run from the complex. After 
setting up a perimeter, Woods said, police began a 90-minute search and started 
to pump out the gas that filled the condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
A man later identified as Robert Spell, 18, of Huntington Beach was seen 
running along the complex's rooftop during the search, Woods said. As he jumped 
off, he broke his leg. 
</P>
<P>
Spell and Michael Rodriguez, 22, of Garden Grove were eventually found under 
the huge tent, suffering from inhalation of toxic chemicals, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers became sickened by fumes while they searched in vain for a third 
burglar, whom they thought was still in one of the fumigated units. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to ventilate the place as much as we could," Woods said. "We didn't 
want the third guy to die." 
</P>
<P>
Spell and Rodriguez were arrested on suspicion of burglarizing the vacant 
units, Police Lt. John Woods said. They and the officers were treated at Garden 
Grove Medical Center for inhalation of the poisonous anti-termite chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Spell was later transferred to Western Medical Center-Anaheim, where he was 
held in the prison ward, Woods said. Rodriguez was transferred to Orange County 
Jail.JAMES M. GOMEZ

MOTHER OF BABY FOUND DEAD IS FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Tuesday released a 19-year-old woman whose dead infant had been found 
in a Dumpster, saying they had no proof that the baby was born alive. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Alejandra Baena, 19, of Santa Ana told investigators that the 
baby was stillborn. A preliminary coroner's report Tuesday said that an autopsy 
had failed to establish whether the badly decomposed, 3-day-old body had been a 
living baby, and so murder charges could not be pressed, Sgt. Chet Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Further information from the coroner's office is pending, and the investigation 
is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that we're really looking at is did anyone else ever see the baby 
move, did anyone see that it was, in fact, breathing," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Baena, who speaks only Spanish, concealed her pregnancy from most of the 
residents of the Anaheim apartment complex where she has lived weekdays for two 
years as a baby-sitter for Maria Candida Romero. She was arrested there Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although some residents there said they saw the baby in trash that Baena was 
carrying Friday afternoon to a nearby Dumpster, Barry said, no one is being 
considered as an accomplice to the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Romero, 16, one of Maria Candida Romero's children, said she had no 
idea that Baena was pregnant. But she said her mother told her after Baena's 
arrest Monday that she had known the baby-sitter was pregnant and had offered 
to let her and the new baby stay at the apartment with the family. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Romero said that Baena came from a strict family and was not allowed to 
have a boyfriend until she was 21, but that she had been seeing a boy secretly 
for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The two teen-agers rarely did things together, she said. She characterized 
Baena as an "innocent girl" who "never went out," adding that when she wasn't 
with the Romeros, she was with her boyfriend or visiting her own family. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the type that could be a nursery school teacher. She loved the kids, she 
cooked for us, and the place was always clean." 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Romero said she was going to work Friday when a friend of the family 
who also lives there noticed that Baena had been in the bathroom for hours. 
Claudia Romero said she asked Baena if she was all right, and she answered that 
she was fine, so she left without giving it more thought. LISA MASCARO

CAVE-IN CUTS PHONE SERVICE TO 25,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Things went from bad to worse this week at Prime Financial Securities, a 
four-broker securities firm on Ocean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
First, the stock market on Monday began its 93-point dive to its lowest level 
in nearly 10 months. Then, about 10 a.m., all the phones in Laguna Beach went 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"Things came to a screeching halt around here," said broker George Abrahamsen. 
"It was almost as bad as '87, but in '87 we had phones and no buyers." 
</P>
<P>
Abrahamsen was experiencing the same problem that 25,000 General Telephone 
customers in Laguna Beach had to contend with Monday and Tuesday. Because a 
phone cable was damaged during a cave-in on Coast Highway, they could call 
within the three Laguna Beach prefixes but nowhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Even the mayor of Irvine was put out. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is mad at me," said Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan, who Monday evening 
tried to return her calls from her beach home, a trailer in Laguna Beach's El 
Morro Trailer Park. "All I could get was a busy signal." 
</P>
<P>
The cave-in injured two workers installing a sewer pipe and sheared a cable 
carrying 400 phone lines, said Linda Bonniksen, a spokesman for Pacific Bell. 
It was a Pacific Bell cable, but it cut out service to General Telephone 
customers in Laguna Beach, Bonniksen said. 
</P>
<P>
The outage also cut all emergency 911 calls to the Laguna Beach Police and Fire 
departments, according to Fire Chief Rich Dewberry. But he said all 911 calls 
were quickly rerouted through the San Clemente Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was an emergency we missed, we don't know about it yet," Dewberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven truckloads of Pacific Bell employees worked until 4 a.m. Tuesday to 
repair the cable. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very, very difficult task," she said. "They had to take 400 pieces of 
copper wire and match them to their mates, all in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
All service was restored by Tuesday noon. 
</P>
<P>
Bonniksen said an investigation will determine who is liable for the damage. 
Preliminary reports indicate the cable was cut when workers were forced to 
shore up a ditch to help the trapped men. 
</P>
<P>
She could not put a monetary value on damages, nor could Abrahamsen estimate 
what it cost his company. 
</P>
<P>
Bonniksen said Pacific Bell would reimburse its customers only for 
one-thirtieth of the monthly service -- and only if they ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't reimburse for any perceived lost business," she said. "The Public 
Utilities Commission protects us in accidents like this." LEN HALL

DAVID SILLS TO HEAD 4TH COURT OF APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David G. Sills, a former mayor of Irvine, was appointed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday to the prestigious post of presiding justice 
of the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Sills' appointment to the state appellate court is subject to confirmation by 
the Commission on Judicial Appointments. No date has been set yet for that 
hearing. If confirmed, Sills would replace Harmon G. Scoville, who retired from 
the presiding justice's position April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great choice," said Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald E. 
Smallwood. "He has a marvelous ability to motivate people and get the best from 
those around him. He's a hard worker with a good mind and a great sense of 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
Sills, 52, was tapped to take the helm of Division 3 of the 4th District Court 
of Appeal, which reviews the civil and criminal decisions of Orange County 
Superior Court. Division 3 is the busiest appellate court panel in the state, 
generating about 1,000 decisions each year. 
</P>
<P>
Other divisions of the 4th District sit in San Diego and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Sills, an Irvine resident who has been on the Superior Court for five years, 
said he was "very excited" by the appointment and looked forward to the 
challenge. State appellate justices serve 12-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Crosby Jr., an associate justice on the 4th District Court of Appeal, 
said he and his three fellow justices welcomed the appointment. Crosby said he 
and his colleagues were impressed with Sills when he filled in as an appeals 
justice for a few months in late 1988 and early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Sills wrote two published opinions which are now "landmarks 
in their fields," Crosby said. In one, the court held that it was illegal for 
Santa Ana police to strike, and in another, the panel decided that the city of 
Stanton had illegally tried to zone an adult bookstore out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it showed both sides of him, because here was one traditionally 
conservative decision, which prevented a strike by police, and also a liberal 
one, defending the rights of an adult bookstore," Crosby said. "I think it 
showed good balance on his part." 
</P>
<P>
Sills was an Irvine city councilman from 1976 to 1985, and served as mayor for 
four of those years, presiding over Irvine's initial development boom. He 
challenged Nolan Frizelle (R-Huntington Beach) in the GOP primary for state 
Assembly in 1982 but lost. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., and the University of 
Illinois law school, Sills maintained a private law practice in Newport Beach 
and in Orange for 20 years, specializing in business litigation, before 
Deukmejian appointed him to the Superior Court in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For most of his time in Superior Court, Sills has handled civil cases, and he 
has spent the last year assigned to complex litigation, including the sprawling 
investors' dispute that stemmed from the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Sills is Ronald Reagan's former son-in-law, having been married to Maureen 
Reagan from 1964 to 1967, when Reagan was governor of California. Sills' 
current wife, Susan, is in public relations.CATHERINE GEWERTZ

SAVE OUR PARKS MAY FACE RIVAL INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, in a move denounced by some local environmentalists, is 
considering a rival ballot measure to thwart an initiative sponsored by Save 
Our Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Our Parks initiative, which has already qualified for the Nov. 6 
ballot, would forbid the sale or lease of park or beach land unless approved by 
a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Friday will consider a rival measure that would allow the 
lease of parks and beaches without a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The rival measure surfaced at the City Council's regular Monday night meeting. 
Tom Duchene, a leader of a coalition of parents seeking a "youth sports 
complex" at Central Park, told the council that the Save Our Parks initiative 
would be harmful to the sports effort. 
</P>
<P>
Duchene said the Save Our Parks initiative would prevent parks from 
accommodating any structure more than 3,000 square feet in floor area or 
costing more than $100,000, unless approved by voters. Duchene said that 
restriction would mean that the proposed youth sports complex would have to be 
put to a citywide vote if the Save Our Parks measure passes on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not force our kids and their parents to wage expensive political 
campaigns just to have a place to play in our community," Duchene said. He then 
urged the City Council to adopt another, less-restrictive ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Parks officials and some other environmentalists at the City Council 
meeting spoke against Duchene's proposal. But a majority of the council favored 
the idea. By a 4-1 vote, the council called for a meeting at 9 a.m. Friday to 
consider Duchene's proposed ballot measure. If it is approved, the Duchene 
ballot measure would then go on the Nov. 6 ballot as a competitor to Save Our 
Parks. BILL BILLITER

COMPOSITE DRAWING OF SUSPECT RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have released a composite drawing of the suspect in last week's Newport 
Beach jewelry heist. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who entered the store Jewels by Mondonna at about 11 a.m. on July 31, 
posed as a customer before pulling out a handgun and forcing the two store 
employees to the rear of the shop. He tied up the two workers and then fled, 
stealing an undetermined amount of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The employees described the man as about 40 years old, about 6 feet tall and 
weighing about 200 pounds. He had black and gray hair, blue eyes and a muscular 
build. 
</P>
<P>
Police are asking that anyone with information about a man matching such a 
description call (714) 644-3785.

CLYDE THE CAMEL USED TO PROTEST WATER-CUTBACK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Critics of a state water plan paraded a camel outside a hearing Tuesday to 
protest proposed cutbacks in Southland water supplies from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-pound camel was kept tethered outside UC Irvine's Beckman Center as 
the State Water Resources Control Board conducted a hearing into its plan to 
monitor more closely the amount of water flowing through the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California water officials said the plan would curtail Southland water 
shipments from the delta by up to 15%. Members of the Southern California Water 
Committee, a coalition of Southland water and political leaders, said they 
brought the camel to the hearing to underscore their concerns that the region 
is approaching desert-like conditions and would only suffer more under the 
state plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of bringing a camel is to call attention to all Southern 
California residents that we have water problems today," Ventura County 
Supervisor John K. Flynn, chairman of the water committee, said Tuesday as he 
and another committee member posed for photographs with the animal. 
</P>
<P>
The other committee member, Peer Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water 
District, also pointed to the camel's water-filled humpback as an illustration 
of how the state needs to provide more storage facilities for Northern 
California mountain runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Swan said that surplus water from wet years needs to be saved so that it can be 
used in dry years. California is locked in the fourth year of a drought. 
</P>
<P>

Tuesday's hearing in Irvine was the latest in a series of hearings that the 
state water board has been conducting throughout the state since 1987. The 
hearings are on the future of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, an 
environmentally sensitive estuary through which the majority of Northern 
California water is diverted to both Southern California and the San Francisco 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The state board recently drew up a plan intended to better safeguard delta 
agriculture, fish and wildlife. It is that plan that the Southern California 
water community is opposing. A final decision on the plan is not expected for 
several more months.

Electromagnetic fields created by high-tension power lines do not pose a health 
risk to nearby residents, according to a prominent scientist who has studied 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has been in county headlines recently, with Tustin residents fighting 
Southern California Edison's plan to build a substation there and Fountain 
Valley parents urging their school district to test electromagnetic fields at 
schools next to power lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not found any convincing evidence that there's a problem," said Dr. 
John C. Bailar, a recent recipient of a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship, 
faculty member of the McGill School of Medicine at Montreal, Canada, and 
consultant to the New England Journal of Medicine and the U.S. Public Health 
Service's Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's enough evidence to say it's unlikely there's a health problem 
related to the power lines, and even if we're wrong and there is a health 
problem, then it's small," said Bailar, who was in Anaheim on Tuesday to lead a 
discussion about radiation and health risks as part of the American Statistical 
Assn. convention. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to studies that link long-term electromagnetic field exposure with 
higher rates of some forms of cancer, a parent group in Fountain Valley has 
urged school district officials to hire an independent consultant to measure 
the fields. Measurements taken by Southern California Edison have differed 
greatly from those taken by the parent group. 
</P>
<P>
"Measurements often vary a great deal because the fields vary," said Bailar, 
who organized a conference last year on electromagnetic fields. "A matter of 
several feet or even several inches could make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Measuring the fields can be difficult, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Supt. Ruben Ingram has said he is not certain that he can 
justify taking money away from education programs to hire a consultant when 
there is no consensus on how to interpret and respond to the results of 
electromagnetic field measurements. School district officials are concerned but 
have been waiting to act until health officials provide advice about possible 
health risks. 
</P>
<P>
While parents are frustrated by the district's position, Bailar said he thinks 
that the district's reaction is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not see a need for taking more measurements other than for 
historical purposes on the off-chance that future studies reveal a link between 
the electromagnetic fields and health problems. 
</P>
<P>
What is really needed, Bailar said, is a large study funded by government, 
power companies and concerned communities, with comment from all interested 
parties so all will accept the results. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if there is no scientific problem, we now have a public policy problem, 
and it might be worth doing additional study to see whether these concerns are 
justified and to allay the fears of parents and others," Bailar said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the research, which he estimated would cost more than $1 million, 
should be a large-scale study of people exposed to various levels of 
electromagnetic fields over a long enough time span to determine the frequency 
of serious diseases.

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bus eases to a halt in front of two solemn columns of granite. A brown 
shirt leaves the guard station, waves the bus through and pushes a button that 
retracts a gate of black wrought-iron spikes. 
</P>
<P>
The bus weaves to the left, passing alongside the rugged gray walls, the steel 
bars and the stained limestone pillars, heading to a side entrance where 
another guard awaits its arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The bus carries no prisoners, just the Rams to their Tuesday morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin's Olympiastadion, a monumental failure in both objective and design, 
gets a second chance at sports history Saturday when the Rams and the Kansas 
City Chiefs play in American Bowl '90. This time, it hosts the first National 
Football League game in Germany. Last time, it hosted the 1936 Olympic Games, 
two weeks that neatly foreshadowed the fall Adolf Hitler would have nearly a 
decade later in another arena. 
</P>
<P>
The 1936 Olympics were in tended to be Hitler's games, a five-ringed 
international propaganda rally. The Aryan race was going to rule these races 
and the rest of the world was going to gain an education in Hitler's wacked-out 
theory of success-through-genetics. 
</P>
<P>
Since Olympiastadion was to serve as Hitler's stage, it was built to look the 
part. The result was as grim and foreboding as a Nazi storm trooper, a 
76,000-seat military barracks cast in limestone, marble, granite and basalt. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Cleveland Stadium was drawn from the same blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
Hitler oversaw all the architectural planning, down to the selection of the 
stone blocks. Natural stone and not concrete was to be used, Hitler decreed, 
because it symbolized "indomitable German strength and the enduring nature of 
the National Socialist ideology." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Hitler ignored, however, is now also cast in stone, on the wall next 
to the Olympic torch -- a complete listing of 1936 gold medalists. 
</P>
<P>
The first two lines read: 
</P>
<P>
 100m LAUF: OWENS, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 200m LAUF: OWENS, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
A young American black named Jesse Owens forever altered the meaning of those 
games with the four gold medals he swept away, including the long jump -- then 
known as the broad jump -- and the 4 x 100-meter relay. The broad jump pit 
occupies the same spot as it did then -- situated, tauntingly, only feet away 
from the Fuhrer's private box. 
</P>
<P>
It is eerie to watch the Rams train amid such surroundings. They practice 
outside the stadium, at the adjacent Maifeld, where Mussolini addressed a crowd 
of 900,000 Germans in 1937. They run pass patterns in the shadow of the Bell 
Tower, which was destroyed by Soviet troops during World War II and rebuilt 
during the 1950s. To get from the field to the locker room, they pass between 
two mammoth sculptures of German athletes and walk down a corridor decorated by 
Gothic iron torches. All that's missing is a gargoyle by the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The facility does not sport one swatch of paint. It is a uniform mausoleum 
gray, save for the black scorch marks sustained during Allied bombing near the 
end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
According to stadium manager Peter Schliesser, the south half of the coliseum 
was shelled after the Allies learned the Nazis were manufacturing radio 
equipment underneath the stands. Had they been enemies of real taste, they 
would have hit the northern half, too. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the building was spared greater damage for strategic purposes, since 
Allied pilots often used Olympiastadion as a directional checkpoint during 
their raids on Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction began in 1952 and lasted a decade. It has been restored with its 
original Teutonic austerity in tact, although several concessions to 
contemporary demands have been added. 
</P>
<P>
Today, an electronic scoreboard, capable of rendering full-color replays, hangs 
from the east end. In preparation of the 1974 World Cup, an acrylic rain 
cover-and-light-structure was suspended above the north and south rims of the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the schedule of events has changed. Two second-division soccer teams, 
Hertha BSC and Blau-Weiss 90, play their home games at Olympiastadion. The 
annual West German Cup soccer final is also held there. On the stadium grounds, 
an outdoor amphitheater shows American movies -- a recent viewing of "Dirty 
Dancing" drew 20,000 -- and the Maifeld is now used for rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Maifeld seats 60,000 in the stands plus 250,000 on the grass," Schliesser 
says. "All the promoters are looking forward to getting that in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
The Globetrotters have also played Olympiastadion, most notably in 1953, when 
Owens accompanied the team for his first post-Olympics return to Berlin. The 
event attracted an overflow crowd of 77,000 -- most of them uninterested in 
exploding basketballs. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse Owens is very popular here," Schliesser says. "When he died, they named 
a street after him, Jesse Owens Allee. It runs right by the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Schliesser said Owens made many visits after that. "I must have met him five 
times," Schliesser says. "He liked to come back here." 
</P>
<P>
Owens was one of the few, but then, he was one of the proud. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and the Chiefs? They are here on a different mission. This week, the 
disbelievers are soccer fans, who have yet to observe a better brand of 
football than their own brand. 
</P>
<P>
The conversion attempt will take place Saturday night. By then, Olympiastadion 
will be festooned with giant inflatable Ram and Chief helmets. Its bleachers 
will be dotted with Ram and Chief T-shirts. Its end zones will be painted Ram 
blue and Chief red. 
</P>
<P>
Good. The place could use some color.

FRAZIER, LLOYD, KRONEMANN EARN TENNIS HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former UC Irvine All-American Trevor Kronemann has been named Team Tennis' male 
most valuable player and male rookie of the year, the league announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Dukes' Amy Frazier, who finished as the third-ranked women's 
singles player, was named female rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
John Lloyd, the Los Angeles Strings' player-coach, was named the coach of the 
year after leading the Strings to a 12-2 regular-season record, the best in the 
league. Robin White of the Strings was named the female most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann, who plays for the Charlotte Heat, edged another rookie, San 
Antonio's Sammy Giammalva, for the awards, which are based on winning 
percentage during the league's one-month regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann was an All-American in each of the four years he played tennis for UC 
Irvine and Coach Greg Patton, who is also the Dukes' coach. Kronemann was a 
late replacement for the Heat. Because he was still playing collegiate tennis 
when Team Tennis held its draft, Kronemann wasn't eligible to be selected. But 
when Mark Dickson was injured, Charlotte picked up Kronemann, who helped the 
Heat qualify for the Team Tennis playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach finished fourth in the four-team West Division and missed the 
playoffs in its inaugural season. The Dukes finished the season 7-7, losing 
their final three matches.

RISING OIL PRICES OFFER LITTLE HOPE LOCALLY; 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: HUNTINGTON BEACH OILMEN ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE RECENT JUMP IN 
PETROLEUM COSTS CAN SAVE THE INDUSTRY HERE FROM EXTINCTION. 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crisis in the Middle East tends to bring macabre joy to the hearts of oilmen, 
but the skyrocketing petroleum prices resulting from the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait aren't causing much excitement in this seaside city that oil built. 
</P>
<P>
The terrain is still dotted with hundreds of oil wells, and offshore platforms 
loom beyond the wide, sandy beaches. But dwindling reserves and rising real 
estate values have long driven the local oil industry toward extinction, and 
the recent jump in crude oil may not even slow -- much less reverse -- that 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, local oil companies, which include independent owner-operators with 
a handful of wells and major international firms such as Shell Oil Co. and 
Chevron USA, are planning to just wait and see if the oil prices remain high. 
</P>
<P>
"This has happened too fast and too furious," said Jack Teberg, an independent 
operator who owns 22 Huntington Beach wells and is president of Independent Oil 
Producers Assn. of Huntington Beach. "This is not a normal, sustainable 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Teberg said higher prices might make him "a little more reluctant" to 
sell his wells to real estate developers. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach crude is a relatively heavy, low-grade oil, and it sells for 
less than West Texas Intermediate and other varieties of crude that are used as 
benchmarks in setting world oil prices. Huntington Beach crude dropped to a low 
of $10 a barrel in June but was priced Wednesday at about $16.50. The benchmark 
crudes, which normally cost $5 to $6 more than local product, were fetching 
more than $28 a barrel on the futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Weaver, an independent operator who owns 33 wells and an oil equipment 
supply business, said a consistent price of more than $20 a barrel would be 
necessary to "change the complexion of the situation" in Huntington Beach, and 
he was not optimistic that it would occur. 
</P>
<P>
And even if it did, most in the industry say, the steady decline of the local 
industry would not be reversed. Many of the city's 900 producing wells now 
yield only a few barrels of oil a day, and production totals just 400,000 
barrels a year -- down from as many as 10 million barrels a year from 4,000 
wells in the 1920s, according to city oil field inspector Mark Bodenbender. 
</P>
<P>
The number of independent operators also has declined steadily with a 
precipitous drop occurring after oil prices fell in 1986. Teberg said the 
number of members in his association has fallen from 46 to less than 20 since 
1986, and only about 50 to 75 independent wells are now in operation. 
</P>
<P>
Major oil companies also have cut back their production. Chevron USA has been 
steadily scaling back its Huntington Beach operations, and the company now 
plans to shut its remaining 125 wells by November, said Bob Nettle, Chevron's 
area superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was extremely doubtful that even a substantial, long-term increase 
in oil prices would cause the company to change its plans. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's move is symbolic of the forces that are pushing oil out of the city: 
Chevron owns the Huntington Beach Co., the city's largest landowner, and has 
chosen to pursue real estate development rather than oil production. Real 
estate developers don't like unsightly oil wells next to their fancy new 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
Stricter regulation of oil wells by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District and the city also have hurt small operators. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shell Oil Co., which operates 280 wells in the city and an additional 40 
on an off-shore platform, plans to stay in the local oil business. Shell 
spokesman Bill Gibson said a sustained price increase could lead the company to 
bring about 10 to 20 previously unprofitable wells back into production. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long term, Gibson added, Shell could invest in expensive technology to 
recover more oil from the fields if the price stayed high, but he cautioned 
that there was no certainty that Shell would make the investment funds 
available to the Huntington Beach operation even if the price did stay up. 
</P>
<P>
High oil prices could also give a boost to several efforts at so-called 
"secondary recovery" that are now under way. Traditional drilling and pumping 
have recovered only about 10% of the oil beneath Huntington Beach, said South 
Coast Oil Corp. President Stephen Harris, and injecting water or steam into the 
ground and installing underground pumps can allow the recovery of an additional 
20% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Such secondary recovery programs, however, require the drilling of new wells, 
and that requires a long series of permits and reviews and often riles the real 
estate industry, Harris said. South Coast is still at work on a long-standing 
secondary recovery plan for a large area of downtown Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One local firm, Angus Petroleum, recently gained permits to begin drilling 
secondary recovery wells in the eastern part of the city, Bodenbender said. 
Proponents of these efforts say they actually clean up the area, because 
existing wells are shut down and dismantled and the oil tapped via new wells 
that are drilled at an angle from a single, central location. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the price increases "would certainly help the economics" of the 
South Coast secondary recovery project, "but the irony of this is that we're 
still not at the price we were at when we started this thing in 1981."

CALCOMP'S GROWING MIDEAST SALES EFFORT NOW AT 'STANDSTILL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Cristina Lee Times staff writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was supposed to be the year that CalComp, the Anaheim computer graphics 
manufacturer, made headway in cracking the Middle East market. 
</P>
<P>
Through June of this year, the company's exports to the Middle East jumped 42%, 
to $1 million, from the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
And the company was projecting that exports to the region would double by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
But after Iraqi troops swept into Kuwait and occupied the tiny oil-rich nation, 
"our business in the Middle East literally has come to a standstill," said 
Larry Sanders, CalComp's sales and marketing manager. "A number of our 
shipments enroute to that region were secured by letters of credit from banks 
in Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
CalComp isn't the only Orange County company that is beginning to feel the 
pinch from trouble in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Unless oil prices drop in the next few days, the county's exporters and 
importers say they expect to be paying higher transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The steamship companies that I spoke to Monday are adopting a wait-and-see 
attitude and they told me they'd know in 10 days if prices will rise or not," 
said Kathleen Riggs of Tansey &amp; Riggs, an El Toro freight forwarder. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, if you go and charter a vessel now for a sailing to take place in 
the next month, you'd have a hard time finding a price because of the 
uncertainty of the fuel cost," said Dave Carden, president of Nedrac, a Costa 
Mesa freight-forwarding company that charters vessels for exporters. 
"Everybody's very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
There is some consolation, though, for U.S. traders: Many of their foreign 
competitors face similar problems now that their governments have joined the 
call for economic sanctions against Iraq.

WHEN COUPLES FEUD, IT'S GENDER THAT CAN CAUSE SPARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The dramatic fall of the crystal chandelier to which Oliver and Barbara Rose 
were desperately clinging in last year's divorce film, "The War of the Roses," 
marked the end of a vicious battle that took the war between the sexes to rare 
heights of physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
If you couldn't relate but still found yourself cringing, it may be because 
most of the real-life battles between men and women take place on a quieter 
front -- in a war of words and silences misinterpreted often enough to make 
couples wish they could occasionally cut loose as the Roses did and throw 
things at each other. 
</P>
<P>
What many couples don't realize is that they bring basic gender differences to 
the table every time they negotiate, says Bobbi Nesheim, a psychotherapist who 
practices in Fullerton and San Clemente. The male-female stereotypes that 
feminists have fought against for so long contain grains of truth that 
shouldn't be ignored by couples having trouble communicating, she says. 
</P>
<P>
When Nesheim counsels couples, she often finds that it helps to point out ways 
in which male-female differences condition what they say -- or don't say -- to 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
Once you acknowledge that generalizations about male vs. female tendencies 
don't fit everyone, Nesheim says, you can see that in many relationships, 
conflicts arise because a woman is more likely to respond emotionally or 
intuitively while a man reacts intellectually. The woman also feels more 
comfortable expressing her feelings than her mate, she wants to talk more than 
he does and she's more interested in exploring issues than resolving them. 
</P>
<P>
Among those with whom Nesheim has found it helpful to discuss gender 
differences are the Rev. Robert M. Boyer and his wife, Lesley, of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
As rector of St. Clements by-the-Sea, an Episcopal church in San Clemente, 
"Father Bob" has learned that "most of our days are spent repairing 
miscommunication that has occurred." 
</P>
<P>
He encourages his parishioners to spend more time talking things through with 
their mates. However, he admits, "I give this advice to everyone, but I have a 
terrible time doing it myself." 
</P>
<P>
Bob, 48, and Lesley, 47, have been married two years. Lesley, who has two grown 
children from a previous marriage, is still adjusting to her role as stepmother 
to Bob's boys, ages 15 and 11, who live with them. 
</P>
<P>
When the Boyers married, Lesley, a former elementary school teacher, agreed to 
stop teaching and take over the family finances as well as the day-to-day 
responsibilities of caring for the children and home. 
</P>
<P>
"All my energy is centered outside the home," Bob explains, "and I'm caught 
with the old-fashioned idea that women will take care of things at home." 
</P>
<P>
Lesley was happy to do that in the beginning, but step-parenting proved a 
bigger challenge than she anticipated, and she soon found she had a lot to 
discuss with Bob at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lesley explains, "When Bob comes home, all he wants to do is be. I 
want him to sit down and listen." 
</P>
<P>
With Nesheim's help, Lesley is learning to give Bob some quiet time to unwind 
before she shares the frustrations of her day. And Bob, who describes himself 
as a "compulsive worker," is learning to make more time for his family and to 
regularly set aside time with Lesley to discuss family matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Boyers say that discussing gender differences with Nesheim has helped them 
understand the conflict they face when Bob comes home expecting a quiet 
household where the day's problems have been solved and instead finds Lesley 
eager to talk about her feelings and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Women do a lot of sharing for the sake of sharing, not with the expectation 
that a problem's going to be solved. But a lot of the time, men are not 
pleasured by the process of talking; they want results," Nesheim says. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a woman tells her husband about a fight she has had with her 
mother. He wants to call instantly and confront his mother-in-law, but that 
makes his wife angry at him too, because she is still trying to work through 
her feelings and isn't ready to act. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to solve her problem. She just wants to share it and get his 
empathy," Nesheim notes. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations between men and women may get derailed because men tend to prefer 
mulling things over privately before taking a position, while many women prefer 
to think aloud, says Joe Tanenbaum, author of "Male &amp; Female Realities: 
Understanding the Opposite Sex." 
</P>
<P>
Without recognizing these differences, men tend to misinterpret what women say 
and women tend to find men remote and unresponsive, says Tanenbaum, a Costa 
Mesa expert on interpersonal communication who deals with gender differences in 
his seminars on relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Men also tend to be more literal in their use of words than women, Tanenbaum 
notes. For example, he says, there's the age-old conflict between men and women 
over commitment. When men hear that often-intimidating word, they think 
confinement -- Webster's defines it as: 1) being committed and 2) official 
consignment of a person to prison -- while women see commitment as the 
beginning of growth and discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that you know what your partner is thinking -- or that your mate 
approaches life the same way you do -- is bound to cause problems, says 
Tanenbaum, who often gives talks in the workplace to help people bridge the 
"gender gap" in their professional as well as personal relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Tanenbaum says couples can overcome the "gender gap" by recognizing that their 
partner is acting on natural impulses rather than deliberately hindering the 
communication process. Then they can feel compassion for each other and begin 
some give and take. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask questions instead of making assumptions," he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who has a need to talk might ask, "Can we discuss this now?" Or a man 
who needs to resolve things might ask, "Can we get to the bottom line?" 
</P>
<P>
"You can invite each other to try another way of communicating. Part of your 
gift to each other is to trade off," Tanenbaum says. 
</P>
<P>
The partner who is feeling strongest at the moment should put the other's needs 
first, though sometimes both are so vulnerable that this can't be done. That's 
when couples need time apart and supportive friends of the same sex with whom 
they can talk so they can return to each other fresh and ready to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"Be more willing to hear that what the other person is saying is the truth to 
them," Tanenbaum advises. "There is another point of view as legitimate as 
yours. The difficulty is that both genders think the other has the advantage. 
But nobody's in control. We just see things differently."

There are many ways for couples to misunderstand each other, and recognizing 
them is the first step toward better communication, says Bobbi Nesheim, a 
psychotherapist who founded the Center for Creative Growth in Fullerton and 
also practices in San Clemente. She also advises: 
</P>
<P>
* Constantly be aware that everyone is unique. 
</P>
<P>
Being different doesn't mean one of you is right or wrong. Honor your 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
* Never assume that you know what the other person is thinking or the rationale 
for his or her behavior. When in doubt, ask. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember that you have a right to request and a right to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
* Stop and think before you blurt something out. Mean what you say and say what 
you mean. 
</P>
<P>
* Take time out to listen. 
</P>
<P>
* Confrontation is good because it clears the air, but don't put each other 
down or bring up the past. And choose a time when you're both strong and ready 
to talk. 
</P>
<P>
* Cultivate your sense of humor. SHERRY ANGEL

THE TUSTIN MARKETPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALLAS M. JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are power lunches, power suits and power neckties. But wait, there's a 
new concept on the horizon . . . a power center. 
</P>
<P>
For the uninitiated not up on the latest newspeak, a power center is not a 
shelter where recalcitrant consumers are hooked up to electrodes and zapped 
until all their plastic is melted into an unusable heap. A power center is the 
new buzzword for a strip center on steroids -- a major open-air retail center 
that combines the off-price advantages of a community shopping center with the 
far-reaching drawing power of a regional mall, such as a South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Like Orange County needs another mall, right? 
</P>
<P>
"The Tustin Marketplace really isn't in competition with South Coast Plaza or 
any of the other regional malls," said John Allen, a leasing representative for 
Donahue Schriber, the Newport Beach-based developer responsible for filling the 
new 80-acre shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"At regional malls you expect to pay full retail. The Marketplace has more 
community-type stores that sell merchandise off price. A tenant at a community 
mall won't go into a regional mall and vice versa," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
And it's true. While there is no Robinson's, Nordstrom, I. Magnin, Saks Fifth 
Avenue or designer boutiques to make deep dents in the plastic, there are more 
moderately priced stores -- Clothestime, T.J. Maxx, Ross Dress for Less, and 
the $5 Clothing Store -- that feel right at home at the new 
750,000-square-foot, palm-tree-lined center quickly nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
The mall, which is painted terra cotta and brick red with purple and fuchsia 
accents, is smartly divided into three distinct sections. One side is dedicated 
mostly to hard goods and includes such nationally known stores as Home Depot, 
Stor and the Waterbed Gallery; the opposite corner is predominantly soft goods 
and is host to Kids 'R' Us, Chick's Sporting Goods, C&amp;R Clothiers, Payless 
ShoeSource and the soon-to-open Good Guys, a San Francisco-based audio/video 
outlet that will open its first Orange County store in the Marketplace this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle will be the Village, an entertainment center described by Allen 
as "fun and festive." Eventually, the Village will boast a bookstore, Tower 
Records, a variety of food shops and a six-screen Edwards Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tenant mix second to none. We pride ourselves on a good mix so that 
everyone will do well," Allen explained. 
</P>
<P>
Store managers seem to agree. Kids 'R' Us manager Jayne Monge said business is 
going well and he likes the location of the Tustin Marketplace. And why not? 
With frontage along the Santa Ana Freeway, an estimated 200,000 cars daily pass 
the center with the violet-and-white sign boldly proclaiming "Tustin 
Marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
But it's the plans for expansion in the immediate area that have Ross Dress for 
Less manager Diane Ershig so enthusiastic. "We love being in the Marketplace. 
We like the proximity to Irvine, the new homes being built around us and being 
in a brand-new, exciting center," she said. "Also, our store is a prototype. 
It's a newer look of the Ross stores. The store has more 'shopability' -- it's 
more departmentalized. We are consistently busy," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Home Depot, which will be celebrating its one-year anniversary at the Tustin 
Marketplace next month, has also profited by location. "This is a great 
shopping center -- definitely a state-of-the-art place. We're doing great 
business here," manager Steve Noren said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a typical shopping center," Allen said. "This one is unique and has 
its own character. It's definitely a landmark location." 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, 
noon to 5 p.m. Sunday 
</P>
<P>
Address: 2777 El Camino Real, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous information: When completed, the Tustin Marketplace will have 70 
stores and about 4,000 parking spaces. DALLAS M. JACKSON

STORY BALLETS GET HIGH-PROFILE SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to booking ballet companies, the question arises: When do you 
present the story ballets and when do you schedule mixed-repertory programs? 
</P>
<P>
For the Australian Ballet's engagement this week at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, the company's story ballets are being given the 
high-profile position of weekend performances, while the story ballets, which 
usually are more popular, are running midweek. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience potential and box office potential is stronger for a story ballet 
than for mixed repertory," Center president Thomas R. Kendrick said Tuesday. 
"Usually, the front part of the week is when, if you can have that option, you 
go with the story ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"For the program of mixed repertory on the weekend, hopefully you have time to 
build the audience. And the weekend audience is generally stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Repertory in general, Kendrick said, is decided in consultation with the 
company artistic director: "We ask the company artistic director to tell us 
what they feel best represents their company's work. Where possible, we try to 
do mixed repertory and a story ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"But we try to present different companies and styles," he said, "so that our 
audience gets the chance to see a variety." CHRIS PASLES

SWISS RED CROSS WORKER FREED IN LEBANON; WAS HELD 10 MONTHS

<P>
Kidnapers freed a Swiss Red Cross worker in Lebanon today and handed him over 
to Syrian authorities, a Syrian official said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on the identity of the hostage, one of two Red 
Cross workers kidnaped 10 months ago in Sidon in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first breakthrough in the hostage situation since April, when two 
American hostages were freed. 
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads had said in a 
statement released late Tuesday that it would free the two hostages within 24 
hours. It was not known why only one hostage was expected in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, delivered to the independent newspaper An-Nahar and a Western 
news agency, came with a photograph of captive Emanuel Christen, 33. He 
appeared with short hair, a clipped beard and a mustache and looked straight 
into the camera.

The Egyptian government announced today that an Arab summit on the Iraqi 
invasion will be held in Cairo on Thursday. King Hussein of Jordan said the 
meeting will be the "last chance" to resolve the crisis peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised speech, President Hosni Mubarak spurned a U.S. plan 
for multinational forces under its leadership in Saudi Arabia, opting instead 
for a purely Arab force. Mubarak called for an emergency Arab summit "within 24 
hours" to discuss the crisis and offered to host the summit. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Amman, Jordan's King Hussein said he will attend the 
conference. "We are trying to resolve the problem in an Arab context," the king 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting as the Arab world's "last chance" to solve the problem 
without resorting to further violence. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could understand the anger of Arabs over the inability of Arab 
states to resolve the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by themselves. ' 
</P>
<P>
"I have no plan to present," Hussein said. "The plan will be presented by the 
Arabs themselves. It will be a good and open meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abdel-Moneim, Mubarak's press secretary, told reporters that the 
summit will convene in Cairo on Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Arab leaders will begin arriving for the summit in a matter of hours," he 
said. "This quick response reflects a sense of the gravity of the situation, 
which President Mubarak stressed in his speech." 
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Moneim did not give the exact number of Arab countries that accepted 
Mubarak's summit proposal. But he said they included Saudi Arabia, Syria, 
Algeria, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Libya and Qatar.

The British Foreign Office said Johnson released all the hostages seized Monday

</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Johnson had presented 22 hostages from eight countries, including 
one American, to reporters at a news conference.

A Foreign Office spokesman in London said Britain is waiting for the hostages 
to come to Monrovia from the nearby town of Caldwell, where they are being 
held.

BAR RESCINDS PRO-CHOICE POSITION; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: THE LAWYERS' ASSOCIATION VOTES TO REMAIN NEUTRAL ON THE ISSUE AFTER 
HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS DROPPED OUT OF THE GROUP.

<P>
The American Bar Assn.'s House of Delegates narrowly voted today to rescind its 
pro-choice abortion stance and adopt a neutral position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly two hours of debate, the delegates voted 200 to 188 to remain 
neutral on abortion, affirming an 885-837 vote taken Monday by the ABA General 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The neutrality position now becomes ABA policy. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed hints from the Bush Administration that the ABA's influence 
in Washington would dwindle unless it reversed its pro-choice stance. Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh told the lawyers' group that the Administration might pay 
less attention to ABA judge ratings if the pro-choice stance was not rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
"Choosing sides is unnecessary and harmful to the association as a whole," said 
Charles Weiss of St. Louis at the opening of today's debate. 
</P>
<P>
"While we in the past have taken stands on controversial issues, none have 
struck such a deep cord as (the abortion stand)." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said rescinding the policy "is the right thing to do. It is in the best 
interest of the association as a whole. It will allow many of our colleagues to 
remain a part of us." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the ABA adopted its pro-choice stance in February, hundreds of 
its 360,000 members dropped out of the group. The ABA Board of Governors 
previously recommended scrapping the pro-choice position. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights activists have spent the week lobbying to defeat the neutrality 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Allred, the Los Angeles attorney representing Norma McCorvey, the Jane 
Roe of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that granted women the right to an 
abortion, said those supporting neutrality are just trying to "neutralize the 
power and the influence of the ABA." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the ABA should be neutral on an issue of such import, such 
significance," she said. "And, really, to be neutral, I think, is to buy into 
the anti-choice position, and that's why we're opposed to this so-called 
position of neutrality."

<P>
Numbed by terror and loss, Kuwaiti refugees are telling of desperate attempts 
to escape the Iraqi assault wave and of invaders killing people who tried to 
stop them from entering private homes. 
</P>
<P>
One refugee, 7-year-old Fahd, said Iraqi soldiers had forced their way into his 
family's Kuwait City home and made them turn over everything they owned. 
</P>
<P>
Ghanem al-Asimi, who worked at Kuwait International Airport, described how 
Iraqi troops were "beating up people, stealing cars and forcing drivers to 
stop, shooting them if they disobeyed." 
</P>
<P>
Asimi and other Kuwaitis spoke in the cafeteria of a hotel in Bahrain, to which 
they had fled after Thursday's invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was hysterical," he said. "We kept getting calls from friends saying 
that a few families who tried to stop Iraqis from entering their homes were 
shot dead." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of refugees who made it out were those who fled south on the first and 
second days of the invasion, before the Iraqis stretched their forces along the 
borders. More recent arrivals slipped through the desert. 
</P>
<P>
In Dubai, the capital of the neighboring United Arab Emirates, a number of 
Europeans said they had sneaked across the Kuwaiti desert to safety, pushed by 
a general desperation and a fear of food shortages in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Upton, a 28-year-old Briton, said Iraqi artillery hitting targets in 
Kuwait City persuaded him he "had to go for it fast." 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking north to the city and about 15 miles away saw the shells 
hitting," he said. "It was probably the palace, and that really brought it 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Upton, a shipping company employee, grabbed his 2-year-old daughter and his 
Kuwaiti wife and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving behind all personal belongings, they jumped into a Jeep and drove 840 
miles to Saudi Arabia and on to Dubai on the southern Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Von Schantz, a 31-year-old Stockholm native, and her husband Mikael 
Wiberg, an electronics engineer, fled by car with their daughter and son and a 
German technician. 
</P>
<P>
They left Kuwait shortly after sunrise Sunday, driving to Bahrain from Abu 
Halifa, a southern suburb of Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
"It was safer to risk our lives this way than remain behind," Von Schantz said. 
"Food supplies were beginning to run out in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers in our area seemed almost apologetic and uncomfortable about 
having invaded Kuwait. But soldiers near the border were different, exuding a 
feeling of power."

The woman who said she had affairs with a Roman Catholic archbishop and two 
priests also claimed a sexual relationship with a nun in the mid-1980s, it was 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution said its sources were two people familiar with the 
account Vicki R. Long gave to church officials. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Long, 27, a single mother, claimed she worked with the nun 
at St. Francis Hospital in Columbus, Ga., and was seduced at age 19 during a 
weekend visit they made to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh is the home convent of the Franciscan Sisters of Millvale, which 
furnishes nuns to St. Francis Hospital. The newspaper said repeated telephone 
calls to hospital spokesman R. Craig DuPriest and the administrator, Sister 
Patricia Garrigan, were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
The nun, who was transferred from Columbus, was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Long is seeking financial compensation from the Roman Catholic Church, claiming 
she was seduced by former Atlanta Archbishop Eugene A. Marino when she went to 
him for counseling. Marino, who was the highest-ranking black in the church, 
resigned last month citing health reasons and revealed last week that he had 
been involved in a two-year romantic relationship with Long.

A South African court today sentenced Winnie Mandela's former bodyguard to 
death for murdering a teen-age black activist. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Richardson, coach of the self-styled football club whose members served 
as bodyguards for the wife of black anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, was 
found guilty in May of murdering 14-year-old black activist Stompie Seipei in 
January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson was also convicted of kidnaping four youths, including Seipei. 
</P>
<P>
The Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg rejected defense evidence that 
Richardson, 37, was mentally retarded and depended on Winnie Mandela to the 
extent that he called her "Mommy" and craved her approval. 
</P>
<P>
Transvaal province Atty. Gen. Klaus von Lieres has said that the outcome of 
Richardson's trial would help him decide whether to charge Winnie Mandela.

Oil industry sources said no Iraqi oil was leaving Turkey or Saudi Arabia, 
which carry nearly 90% of Baghdad's exports by pipeline, nor was any oil 
leaving Iraq by sea. 
</P>
<P>
Oil is Iraq's main source of foreign exchange, and a prolonged embargo could 
destroy its economy. It was exporting 2.7 million barrels per day -- 5% of 
world output.

The Federal Reserve warned today that the pace of economic growth is weakening 
and that consumer prices are rising dramatically in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although the data in the Fed's regular "beige book" assessment of the economy 
was collected before the start of hostilities in the Mideast and the subsequent 
jump in energy prices, it echoes the concerns of many economists. 
</P>
<P>
"Business and banking contacts . . . generally report continued economic 
growth, though most noted that the pace was slow or had slackened recently," 
the Fed's report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Wages were reported as rising in a range of 3% to 5%, in most cases excluding 
benefits," the Fed said. "Reports on prices did not display as much consensus, 
with some reporting widespread increases and others noting difficulty in 
passing on cost increases." 
</P>
<P>
But gas and oil companies and farmers appeared to be optimistic, "reflecting 
better weather conditions in major crop and livestock producing areas and an 
improved energy sector," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales showed marginal improvement over last year, the report indicated, 
but demand has fallen off for "big ticket" goods, such as expensive household 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
In some regions of the country, "retailers indicated they had become less 
optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year, though in others they 
were anticipating a slight pickup in sales," the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing was flat, real estate and construction remained weak and borrowed 
money was difficult to obtain in many places, further evidence of a "credit 
crunch" on businesses by banks and other lenders.

Ratners said it has extended the deadline for its bond offer until midnight

</P>
<P>
It declined to say how much of the debt has been tendered so far.

The statement from the company said it is currently negotiating revising terms 
of its offer with representatives of the holders of each class of the notes, 
but the company declined to elaborate.

The addition of Kay's 494 stores would increase Ratners' U.S. outlets to nearly 
1,000, making it the United States' second-largest jeweler after Zales.

A Japanese consortium said today it has developed an agent that may be useful 
in destroying cells infected by the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
In test-tube experiments, the agent destroyed 90% of cells infected by the

Chemical, one of the partners in the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
The other partners are soft-drink maker Calpis Food Industry and Hokkaido

<P>
The agent is composed of ribosome, made from phosphorus liptide and 
cholesterol, and a peptide of the protein film CD4. 
</P>
<P>
A scientist at Hokkaido University said the agent was designed to destroy only 
AIDS-infected cells and would not affect normal cells. 
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo is in charge of further development and hopes to start clinical tests 
in the United States within the year, the spokesman said.

GM President Lloyd E. Reuss told reporters the company was still projecting

But he conceded that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent rise in

That shift would be away from large cars to smaller vehicles. "There may be 
some shift, but I don't see a major shift," he said.

JAMES BOND RIGHTS UP FOR AUCTION

<P>
The owner of the exclusive rights to novelist Ian Fleming's James Bond 
character is putting the super-spy on the auction block after a long run of 
movie hits that has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Variety, the entertainment weekly, said the decision was made by veteran film 
producer Albert Broccoli because revenues from the "007" films have been 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
The latest film, "License to Kill," released last year, cost $30 million to 
make and has grossed only $16 million in domestic theatrical rentals so far. 
</P>
<P>
Variety described the 81-year-old Broccoli's decision to "protect and 
modernize" his franchise on James Bond as a "bloodless coup" within the MGM/UA 
empire, which has made all but one of the 17 James Bond productions.

'MISS SAIGON' CANCELED ON ROAD TO BROADWAY; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THE DECISION FOLLOWS A UNION RULING AGAINST CASTING A WHITE STAR IN AN 
ASIAN ROLE.

The Broadway production of "Miss Saigon" was canceled today after Actors Equity 
refused to allow a white British actor to play the role of a Eurasian in the 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate is no longer about the casting of 'Miss Saigon' but the art of 
acting itself," producer Cameron Mackintosh said in a statement issued on 
behalf of the creative team for the hit London musical. 
</P>
<P>
The show, scheduled to open in March at the Broadway Theater, had advance sales 
of more than $25 million, the largest in Broadway history. The money, 
Mackintosh said, will be refunded. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from Asian groups, Actors Equity on Tuesday rejected the 
application of British actor Jonathan Pryce, denying him the chance to repeat 
his award-winning London performance as a brothel owner. 
</P>
<P>
"The casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an affront to the 
Asian community," said Alan Eisenberg, the union's executive secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"The casting choice is especially disturbing when the casting of an Asian actor 
in this role would be an important and significant opportunity to break the 
usual pattern of casting Asians in minor roles." 
</P>
<P>
The union has jurisdiction over all performers appearing on Broadway and must 
give its approval to actors from foreign countries who appear there, except for 
British "stars." But the definition of "star" is hazy. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not deal with the issue of whether this man is a star or not," 
Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh said he would not take the matter to arbitration, a process that 
Equity suggested Tuesday might be the next step. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh and other producers have argued that the ban is an infringement on 
their right to choose the performers they want. 
</P>
<P>
"When my production team cast the noted black actor Robert Guillaume to replace 
Michael Crawford as the Phantom in the Los Angeles company of 'Phantom of the 
Opera,' we did so purely on the grounds of talent and suitability," Mackintosh 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, in the current Broadway production of 'Phantom' we have an 
Amerasian actor of tremendous ability playing the lead role of the Vicomte de 
Chagny. Why is it quite proper for him to play a European aristocrat and not 
for Jonathan Pryce to play a Eurasian?" 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stigwood, who produced the musical "Evita," said in a letter to Equity 
earlier this week that he is casting the film version of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the view of Actors Equity concerning ethnic casting preclude my 
consideration of an American-Italian female star (Madonna) to play the title 
role?" he asked. "Will I incur the wrath and condemnation of Actors Equity for 
casting a non-Hispanic in the role of Che?" 
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg said the union's decision was made "in full awareness that many jobs 
may be lost to actors of Asian background" if "Miss Saigon" were canceled.

LIZ SMITH: TRUMP'S 'CRYPTO-NAZI' CONNECTION STIRS GOSSIP

EVERYBODY'S TALKING about Marie Brenner's interview in Vanity Fair, especially 
that concerning Donald Trump's manner of having glided over his German 
ancestors. (It's true that reporter James Revson laid all this out in his 
Newsday column months ago, but Marie has revived it with an added dash of 
spice.) To wit, that Donald appears to take aspects of his German background 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
John Walter works for the Trump organization and when he visits Donald in his 
office, Ivana told a family friend, he clicks his heels and says, "Heil 
Hitler," possibly as a family joke. 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Brenner lays out the details of a somewhat amazing story that has been 
making the rounds but, to my knowledge, was never nailed down before; a story 
to the effect that Trump reads from a book of Hitler's collected speeches, 
having kept the work "My New Order" in a cabinet by his bed. (A copy of this is 
also now in the office of Ivana's lawyer, Michael Kennedy, "as if it were a 
grenade.") Brenner notes that Hitler was a master propagandist and that Trump 
has followed in his footsteps, at least in this regard. She calls his habit of 
exaggeration and prevarication "the big lie," and notes that if one keeps 
reiterating something, then some people will finally come to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN MARIE bearded Trump in his den on this issue, he said that it was his 
friend Marty Davis of Paramount Pictures who'd given him a copy of "Mein Kampf" 
and he's a Jew. Davis says he didn't give Trump "Mein Kampf," but the aforesaid 
"My New Order." "I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but 
I'm not Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
Trump told Brenner, "If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I 
would never read them." It is left for Brenner to ask if perhaps Ivana is 
hoping to convince her friends and her lawyers that her husband "is a 
crypto-Nazi." 
</P>
<P>
Brenner describes Ivana as having become something like her husband -- "a 
double agent, able to project innocence and utter confidence." And she quotes 
Kennedy, describing his beautiful client as suffering from the "Stockholm 
syndrome" -- meaning that "she had the mentality of a captive. After a while 
she couldn't fight her captor anymore and began to identify with him. Ivana is 
deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to Donald." 
</P>
<P>
ONE THING you'll be able to pick up from this magazine story is Trump's 
attitude today. 
</P>
<P>
Brenner quotes a Trump attorney as saying: "Donald's very up. This is the kind 
of challenge Donald likes. It's weird. You would never know anything is wrong."

RUNNERS CAN'T QUITE GET IT IN GEAR AT ITALIAN MEET; NO RECORDS FALL;

TRACK: BURRELL AND JOHNSON WIN RACES. THE ORGANIZERS HAD PROMISED A $200,000 
FERRARI IF SOMEONE SET A NEW WORLD STANDARD.

<P>
American sprinters Leroy Burrell and Michael Johnson won their events today, 
but failed in bids to set world records at a meet where records were made a 
lucrative target. 
</P>
<P>
The meet in this Alpine resort more than 6,500 feet above sea level offered a 
$200,000 Ferrari Testarossa and money bonuses for a world record. If more than 
one record was set, organizers said the car would be awarded for the record 
deemed the most significant. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell, who competed in Malmo, Sweden, Tuesday evening and arrived here 
overnight, ran the 100 meters in 9.96 seconds, the best in the world this year 
and just .04 off Carl Lewis' world record. Burrell beat fellow American Calvin 
Smith by .08 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who said he has the capability to improve on Pietro Mennea's 200-meter 
record of 19.72, established in 1979, fell .16 short here, winning in 19.88 
seconds, the second-fastest time at that distance this year. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell said he ran well but did not have his best race. 
</P>
<P>
"I am now focusing on the Zurich meeting. I should be in good shape by then," 
Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Zurich event, on Aug. 15, had been expected to feature a 100-meter duel 
between Burrell and Carl Lewis. But Lewis, who pulled out of the Sestriere 
meeting because of a strained left thigh sustained at the Goodwill Games, is a 
doubtful starter at Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson got off to a slow start but finished strong to clearly beat Brazilian 
Robson Da Silva and American Floyd Heard. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the slow start and a bad curve compromised his record chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a bad curve that I usually do well. I was just a bit off of 
concentration. I am not too pleased with my performance," said Johnson, a 
23-year-old who set a personal best of 19.85 seconds in Birmingham, Ala., in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
The Sestriere meeting, labeled as the meet of records, was held at Europe's 
highest track, with an altitude of 6,600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
American Mike Powell, the top attraction in the long jump in the wake of Lewis' 
absence, posted a winning leap of 27 feet, 7 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Other American victories in the Italian meet were achieved by Danny Everett in 
the 400 meters, Colin Jackson in the 110-meter hurdles and Kevin Young in the 
400-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Barnes took the shot put with a toss of 72-4 1/2, more than three feet 
off his recent world mark.

East Germany's sports association, which has produced some of the world's best 
amateur athletes, said today that it will reduce its staff by half because of a 
drastic budget cut. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,700 of its 6,000 employees will be fired by the end of the year, 
including several coaches who played key roles in East Germany's success at the 
Olympics and various world championships.

<P>
Before last year's revolution that ousted the country's Communist leaders, 
10,500 people worked for the association, then run by the state.

The East German Ministry for Youth and Sports cut its budget by 33%, allocating 
$64 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
There have been discussions about unifying the East and West German teams into

Pacific 10 Conference athletic directors will be discussing expansion this 
weekend in San Francisco because of Arkansas' decision to jump from the 
Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference next year, Pac-10 spokesman 
Jim Muldoon says. 
</P>
<P>
University of Arizona Athletic Director Cedric Dempsey said the Pac-10 is ready 
to look at its options. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that we would be negligent as a conference if we didn't explore what is 
out there," Dempsey said. "We are headed toward the merging of conferences and 
realignment on a national basis. It is important for the Pac-10 to stay in the 
forefront." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State of the Western Athletic Conference reportedly has expressed 
interest in joining the Pac-10. Arizona and San Diego State agreed last week to 
renew their football series on a non-conference basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I predict if we do what a lot of people are doing, there may be four or five 
major conferences and a football playoff in the very near future," Dempsey 
said.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY A STEP CLOSER TO GIANTS STADIUM

The San Francisco Giants appeared to move closer to a new home away from chilly 
Candlestick Park when three more city councils agreed to put a financing plan 
for a new stadium on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday night, the Santa Clara, Los Altos and Mountain View city councils 
agreed to let the voters decide whether a tax should be imposed on their 
communities to help build a $152.8-million, 45,000-seat stadium on 120 acres 
south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara council voted 5 to 2 after debating the issue until 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountain View council voted 6 to 0 to place the tax measure on the ballot 
although two council members said they opposed the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a discretionary use of money," Councilwoman Dena Bonnell said. "But I 
feel it's my responsibility to let the voters decide if they want to be taxed. 
It's their choice." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Altos, the City Council voted 3 to 1 to place the 1% utility tax measure 
on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Saratoga City Council rejected the proposal by a vote of 4 to 1, while the 
Campbell council voted 3 to 1 against the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants got a big boost Monday when the San Jose City Council voted 8 to 1 
to support placing the finance plan on the ballot. The plan calls for San Jose 
residents to contribute $7 million annually under the utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
Palo Alto council members Monday night voted 8-0 against the tax. Cupertino 
also rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The support of San Jose, by far the largest city in the county, and Santa 
Clara, site of the proposed ballpark, are the most crucial for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
If endorsed by voters, the tax would raise as much as $16 million annually from 
participating communities. The proposed agreement stipulates that when bonds 
are paid off in 30 years, the utility levy would end. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium backers say that even with some Santa Clara County cities voting 
against the tax proposal, the project could still go forward. 
</P>
<P>
According to San Jose officials, tax revenues from San Jose, Santa Clara, 
Mountain View, Milpitas, and unincorporated Santa Clara County would provide 
more than 80% of the needed stadium financing.

West German Peter Roth overcame 13 rivals with a sizzling second run today and 
won the opening slalom race of the 1990-91 World Cup season by a hundredth of a 
second over Austrian Michael Tritscher. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 29-year-old Roth's first in 12 years on the World Cup 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, 14th after the first run and 1.57 seconds behind leader Alberto Tomba of 
Italy, stormed down the course in 49.53 seconds on his second trip for a 
combined time of 1 minute, 42.69 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Tritscher finished second in 1:42.70 and Tomba ended up third in 1:42.77 after 
a disappointing second run. Afterward, the Italian star said the course, 
softened by overnight snow, hampered him.

Pete Rose arrived at a federal work camp today to begin serving a five-month 
sentence for cheating on his income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's all-time hit leader surrendered at the prison about 1 p.m. CDT. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said he did not want to talk to the media, and Warden John Clark's 
statement said the prison will respect his request for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 49, had a Friday deadline to enter the minimum-security federal prison 
camp. He was convicted on two counts of filing false income tax returns and for 
failing to report more than $350,000 in income from gambling, autograph signing 
and baseball memorabilia sales. 
</P>
<P>
He delayed reporting to prison while he recovered from July 20 knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-man work camp is next to the U.S. Penitentiary-Marion, which houses 
about 350 inmates. Rose is unlikely to have any contact with those inmates, who 
are kept in a building barricaded with razor wire and separated from the prison 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
During his first two weeks at the camp, Rose will stay in a building apart from 
the main dormitory while he is oriented to prison life, authorities said. 
Prison officials will interview him to match his skills to one of about 35 
prison jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's attorneys have said he will not grant interviews during his entire term. 
</P>
<P>
Guards are barred from seeking his autograph.

A bay daughter of Mr. Prospector brought the top price of $1.2 million during 
Tuesday's opening session of the Fasig Tipton Saratoga thoroughbred yearling 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
The filly was purchased by Luca Cumani as agent for a buyer who wasn't 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The filly was consigned by White Birch Farm, which also offered a bay filly by 
Nijinsky II that went for $1.1 million to Tom Skiffington. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three yearlings sold for $12.54 million, an average of $236,717 per 
transaction. Last year's opening session brought in $12.92 million, with an 
average of $339,526 per lot. The sale continues today and Thursday in the Fasig

MAVERICK COACH GIVES PROTEGES THE ADVANTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: CHARLIE DIMARCO FORMED HIS OWN CLUB TO ENSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 
OF ATHLETES WOULD BE MET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The promise of a vaulting pole of his choice lured Charlie DiMarco into 
becoming a track coach 11 years ago, but it is the promise of young athletes 
that is keeping him in his chosen profession. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, disenchanted with what he claimed were numerous restrictions at 
the college coaching level, especially his inability to work with high school 
athletes because of NCAA regulations, DiMarco, 31, resigned as the field events 
coach at Cal State Northridge and started the Advantage Athletics track club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enjoyable when you have to fight the political battles of satisfying 
someone's ego," said DiMarco, who lives in Northridge and still works 
independently with several CSUN athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"What motivates me is to see athletes have the opportunity to reach their 
potential, but that's not always the No. 1 priority with athletic directors. 
</P>
<P>
"All they understand is if the team wins or loses. They don't understand if a 
kid sets a personal best or a school record. 
</P>
<P>
"In track, the bottom line is personal achievement." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco, a full-time employee at On Track, a track and field equipment 
distributor and manufacturer in Glendale, donates his time year-round after 
work and on weekends to help athletes fulfill their potential. In addition, he 
says he provides insurance liability for the club out of his own pocket. There 
are no membership dues and schools for which the athletes compete underwrite 
travel expenses. In rare instances, the athlete himself will pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do it for money because I don't want to put up with the politics of 
being on a high school or college staff," said DiMarco, who likens Advantage 
Athletics to gymnastics and swimming clubs in that the emphasis is placed on 
individual development. "I want to do it for the enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"I get satisfaction as long as someone is improving. I don't have to have the 
top athletes or Olympians." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several athletes have left their mark, literally, under the 
tutelage of DiMarco. Crissy Mills of USC and Campbell Hall High, Walt Stewart 
of CSUN and Melanie Clarke of Valley College all have won significant 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Mills won the girls' high jump in the 1988 and '89 state high school 
championships, prevailing with marks of 5 feet 10 inches and 6-0. Stewart won 
the 1989 NCAA Division II title in the men's high jump (7-0 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who also trains with Valley Coach James Harvey, won the heptathlon in 
the state junior college championships in May and in The Athletics Congress 
junior nationals in June (5,034 points and 5,080). 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who graduated from Notre Dame High, heard about DiMarco's 
individualized training methods and chose to attend Northridge on a partial 
scholarship in 1985 despite the offer of a full ride from Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"I was primarily self-coached in high school," said Stewart, who has a personal 
best of 7-2 1/2 and is still training with DiMarco. "I jumped 6-8 in high 
school, but I still needed help. I really liked the idea of a coach to work one 
to one. I improved four inches in my first year and that's a lot at my level." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who threw 71 feet in the javelin in her first heptathlon in April 
improved to 121-1 in her third heptathlon, in the TAC Junior meet. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really helped me, not only with my technique but (with) what I need to 
focus on before the throw," said Clarke, the woman athlete of the year in field 
events in the Western State Conference. "He's a generous man and loves track. 
He's out there every day and (he is) a great motivator." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stephens, winner of the javelin in the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials, was 
another DiMarco protege at CSUN. Stephens found DiMarco's methods to be sound, 
so much so that in 1984 he won the NCAA Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll take you step by step and show you what to do. . . . That makes things a 
lot easier to understand. He knows the dynamics of throws . . . and how to use 
the stronger muscles to avoid injury." 
</P>
<P>
As much as DiMarco wants to help the athletes who solicit his help, the demands 
placed on his time could eventually limit his effectiveness as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a tendency to take on more than I can handle. I'm just about maxed 
out," said DiMarco, who works daily with nine athletes individually and has 16 
in the club. "If I take any more, it doesn't allow me time to give 100%. I 
can't add people indiscriminately and build my club so big that it can't be a 
hands-on club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not in my personality to turn people away empty-handed, either. I try to 
give them advice or steer them toward an age-group club or a masters club." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco said Advantage Athletics would not have been possible without the 
assistance and support of CSUN track Coach Don Strametz, who allows the club to 
use the Northridge track and weight room facilities. In exchange, DiMarco 
renders his services to the CSUN track program. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely wouldn't be here without him. Strametz pushed through the 
paperwork with the school and got us going," DiMarco said. "He has made the 
facilities available to us and gives us the run of the place every evening." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco, a pole vaulter at Marshall High and Valley College, became 
disillusioned with collegiate track after attending San Jose State for a 
quarter in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't very good and I was looking for help and nobody wanted to (help)," 
said DiMarco, who set a personal best of 14-10 in 1980 while serving as an 
assistant coach at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"They were only interested in the big top guns. I felt that I could be decent, 
but I didn't find a coaching staff that was willing to work with me." 
</P>
<P>
He decided to drop intercollegiate track and complete his degree in television 
broadcasting at Cal State Los Angeles. He got his degree but missed the sport 
and wanted to get back into it. 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco started coaching in 1979 at Valley College as an assistant to Mark 
Covert, currently the track and cross-country coach at Antelope Valley Junior 
College. Covert, the NCAA Division II cross-country champion at Cal State 
Fullerton in 1970, was unable to put DiMarco on salary for his first season but 
dangled another enticement. 
</P>
<P>
"(Covert) was a distance runner and he didn't know anything about vaulting," 
DiMarco said. "He was honest about it and said that if I helped him out that 
he'd get me any pole I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco got the pole of his choice. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, DiMarco's first coaching breakthrough came not in the pole vault 
but in the high jump. Sue Patterson, who jumped 4-10 at St. Genevieve High and 
has since improved to 6-1, placed second in the state junior college meet while 
competing for Valley College in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Both coach and athlete apparently took their relationship and accomplishments 
to heart. DiMarco and Patterson, 27, were married in April. 
</P>
<P>
At CSUN, Patterson was a three-time NCAA Division II All-American, twice in the 
high jump (1985 and '86) and once in the heptathlon ('85). 
</P>
<P>
"By coaching good athletes, I've learned a lot," said DiMarco, who coached at 
Valley and CSUN during the 1984 season, then solely at Northridge the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a two-way exchange, an equal partnership. I don't teach down to athletes. 
I'm at an even level. I learn from them and what they get out (of it) is what 
they give. If they give 100%, they get 100% back. If they give me anything 
less, they get shown to the gate." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stewart: "He's looking for the serious athlete that wants help. He's very 
committed to what he does and expects the same in return." 
</P>
<P>
Leaning on his experiences, DiMarco has designed and marketed several products, 
including a foam rubber practice bar for the high jump and pole vault and an 
elastic cord that is tied to one end of the javelin and the other to a post for 
working on technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't plan on coaching forever," said DiMarco, who eventually would like to 
handle the club's administrative duties and relinquish the coaching chores to 
some of his athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of every season, I tell myself that this will be the year that I 
get out and do something else. But every year the athletes get better and 
better and keep going higher, and I tell myself one more year. This year I 
didn't feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are still tired from the season, but right now I'm revved up and 
ready to go."

SANTIAGO HEATS UP A COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benito Santiago's comeback is shaping up this week at Cashman Field, a couple 
of miles up the strip, out past the wedding chapel with the sign "Dynasty's 
Joan Collins was married here" and on a field that was suffocating in one 
hundred and seven degree heat Tuesday during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago never noticed the heat in 1986, when he spent his only year in Las 
Vegas -- the Padres' Triple-A affiliate -- leading the Stars to the Pacific 
Coast League title. He was too busy then, his mind focused squarely on 
advancing on to the major leagues, so much so that not much else mattered. But 
Tuesday, four years later, there he was, sitting in the air-conditioned Las 
Vegas clubhouse, away from the glare of the major league spotlight and, well, 
it was hot outside. 
</P>
<P>
"Crazy weather here, you know?" he said. "When I played here in '86, it didn't 
feel like it does now. You play four years in San Diego, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
The keys to a rental car sat in his locker, which was fairly empty. In San 
Diego, Santiago's locker is filled with pictures of his wife, Blanco, and his 
children, Benny Beth (four) and Benito Jr. (one). In Las Vegas, there are keys. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to go back to the big leagues," he said. "I don't want to hang 
around here so long." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he is all that unhappy. He is playing baseball again, he is seeing 
some players in Las Vegas whom he hasn't seen in awhile, and his appearance 
here is a big deal. People line up outside the clubhouse after each game, 
waiting for his autograph. The media swarmed to his first game. He did three 
live interviews with local television that night, and Las Vegas first baseman 
Rob Nelson snuck up from behind and shoved a shaving cream pie in his face 
during one. They laughed. 
</P>
<P>
But, there is a limit. This is a serious time, and Santiago is as serious as 
ever. He is coming back from a broken left arm, the first major injury of his 
professional career. It came on June 14, when San Francisco's Jeff Brantley hit 
him with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two months later, Santiago is in Las Vegas, putting his game together 
again. His left arm is fine. His right -- throwing -- arm is a bit sluggish. So 
is his swing. Still, he doesn't figure to be here long. 
</P>
<P>
He is planning to turn in those rental car keys on Thursday, when he will drive 
to the airport to catch a flight to Houston and rejoin the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago sat down with Jack McKeon, Padre general manager, and Greg Riddoch, 
Padre manager, at the end of July and told them he could be back within a week. 
Originally, the plan was for Santiago to accompany the Padres on their current 
road trip and continue his rehabilitation. But when McKeon and Riddoch learned 
that Santiago thought his return was that close, the three decided he'd be 
better off rehabilitating in Las Vegas in game conditions. 
</P>
<P>
So, basically, he is going through his second spring training of the year. The 
first one, in Yuma, came after a rigorous winter of work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to go at the start of the season," Santiago said. 
</P>
<P>
And he was. By June 14, he had nine homers, 33 runs-batted-in, and he was 
batting .317. 
</P>
<P>
"I was right there in everything -- runs, home runs, average, runs scored, 
behind the plate, everything," Santiago said. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the injury. 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious that Santiago was hurt badly. He intended to charge the mound 
after he was hit, but the searing pain took the charge out of his legs and 
caused his body to go limp. He laid on the ground, and X-rays would soon rule 
him out. All he could do was sit and watch, and seethe inside. 
</P>
<P>
He said he spoke briefly with Brantley at the All-Star game July 10th in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"He give me all kinds of excuses," Santiago said. "He told me he felt sorry 
because of that. I just listened to him. I don't talk much, I told him OK, it's 
over with." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were six games out and three over .500 (30-27) when Santiago went 
down, but have gone 20-31 since that day. Santiago doesn't like to talk about 
that, because it involves complimenting himself. He prefers to let the 
accolades come from others. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it mostly ate away at him when all he could do was sit and fidget. He 
couldn't bear to watch an entire Padre game. Instead, he would spend time 
talking to his wife and playing with his kids. Now, he has been cleared to go 
back to work, and his mind is on other things. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest thing right now is his timing, both at the plate and behind the 
plate. He needs to see some pitches and also loosen the kinks in his throwing 
arm. The tough thing about a broken arm is, you can't play catch. So his right 
arm suffered from inactivity while his left was in a cast. In fact, in 
Santiago's mind, that's the biggest thing holding up his return to the Padres 
-- his right arm, not his left. 
</P>
<P>
"Kind of funny, huh?," he said, smiling. "Believe it or not. . . . That's good, 
though, because I know my arm will be ready in a couple of days. If it was (the 
left) one, it would bother me because it might be longer than that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Las Vegas Manager Pat Kelly: "The biggest thing I've noticed is that he's 
not in good shape. The first night, he was tired after five innings. And his 
throwing arm is not completely ready." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago reported to Las Vegas last Thursday and, in his first four games -- 
entering Tuesday's game -- was batting .308 (four for 13) with two RBIs. 
Tuesday, he had a grand slam and a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago is happy with his progress and said he is doing better than he 
expected. The biggest problem came Thursday, in his first game. Benito 
Santiago, All-Star catcher, was nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to be scared," he said. "The first day, you always try to 
be perfect. I tried to relax and I couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
"What really got in my mind was, is it going to be all right, or not? Will 
there be pain? There was no pain. That made me feel a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
He wears a brace on his left forearm, just in case. He also wears uniform No. 
33 on his back -- Paul Faries already had No. 9 -- and a relatively new flattop 
haircut. 
</P>
<P>
And he waits, two more days now, until he returns to the Padres. He bats, he 
throws, he tries not to let the heat drive him nuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad," he said. "But it's a fun city, you know? It's nice." 
</P>
<P>
He played the slot machines for the first time this year last Saturday and won 
about $125 on the dollar slots. 
</P>
<P>
He laughed at the thought, thinking back to his year here in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"When you don't got no money, you win nothing," he said. "Now that I got a 
little bit of money, I win. It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Crazy, like a few minutes earlier when he sat with a smile on his face despite 
the fact that his left wrist was wrapped inside a bulky pack of ice and an ace 
bandage. His right shoulder was also wrapped. It didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real close," he said. "I'm real happy."

MIKE DOWNEY: BUSTER DELIVERS BLOW TO IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the beginning, we have been pretty taken with Buster Douglas. He made 
mincemeat of Mike Tyson; he was living proof that every underdog has its day; 
he seemed to be the most eloquent heavyweight champion since Muhammad Ali and 
most modest since Floyd Patterson, and, first and foremost, he resisted the 
psychological double-babble of Don King, who is the sort of guy who could 
change a $12 bill in fours. 
</P>
<P>
Swollen heads, however, belong to the cosmetics of the boxing business, along 
with broken noses, black eyes, bloody lips and cauliflower ears. And the skull 
size of James (Buster) Douglas, sad to say, seems to be swelling day by day as 
he begins preparation for the Oct. 25 title fight against the undefeated 
Evander Holyfield at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it's Buster who is the mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we see only what we think we see. Maybe he is merely what so many of us 
wanted to see, a lovable lug in a business that by its very nature brings out 
the worst in those who populate it. Maybe Buster Douglas is not America's 
sweetheart after all. Maybe he is simply a boxer, full of sound and fury, 
significant of nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
In Rod Serling's "Requiem for a Heavyweight," when a character makes reference 
to the virtue and nobility of boxing, another says: "Are you kidding? They'd 
hold these things in sewers if there was head room." 
</P>
<P>
Well, boxing is not so dehumanizing as that. It does, on the other hand, make 
braggarts and bullies out of tough customers who no longer can tell the 
difference between self-confidence and self-promotion. Once a boxer gets his 
arm raised often enough, he begins to think his armpit gives off no odor. 
</P>
<P>
So, somewhat abruptly, the Buster Douglas we appreciated most for his 
once-in-a-lifetime heroism and his common courtesy and apparent decency seems 
to be evolving into one of those prickly prizefighters who finds it necessary 
to insult his next opponent and to castigate anybody and everybody who ever 
doubted his superhuman skill. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Buster demands to know how in the world anybody could have been 
ignorant enough to have foreseen Mike Tyson laying a finger on him. Today's 
Buster mocks the qualifications of top-contender Holyfield, mere minutes after 
mentioning that nobody should underestimate the quality of any professional 
boxer. 
</P>
<P>
While they were shooting the bull side by side Tuesday morning in Century City, 
the equally ambitious Holyfield casually observed that he believed himself 
deserving of his shot at the champion, having dispatched 24 opponents without 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Cakewalks!" Douglas cried. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield was caught off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Cakewalks, every one of them!" Douglas said, and he wasn't kidding. "He didn't 
fight anybody!" 
</P>
<P>
This came from a heavyweight more invisible than invincible, whose record 
before the Tyson fight included losses to such noted blood donors as David Bey, 
Mike White, Jesse Ferguson and Tony Tucker, and 10-round decisions over the 
mighty Oliver McCall, Dee Collier and the eminently hittable Randall (Tex) 
Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Holyfield had to strike back. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a cakewalk when I beat you," Holyfield told Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
And here we thought that these two were going to be different, that the new 
champion and the worthy challenger were going to spend the next two months 
treating one another honorably, as sportsmen, without the usual 
come-October-you're-dead-meat heckling that accompanies so many of these 
events. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't expect "When Evander Meets Buster" to be the sweetest encounter since 
"When Harry Met Sally," but we had been looking forward to the fight being 
relatively malice-free. Too much to expect, evidently. It didn't take long 
Tuesday for John Johnson, the guy in the champion's corner, to jabber away on 
the subject of how Buster was about to "knock Evander Holyfield's (rear) off," 
or for one of Evander's entourage, Lou Duva, to jab back with claims that 
Douglas has been ducking his opponent, inventing excuses, doing anything to 
postpone the inevitable and keep that belt for a few weeks longer. 
</P>
<P>
What should be an intriguing bout, possibly worth the five bills it'll take to 
occupy a seat at ringside, shouldn't have to deteriorate into another of these 
one-ring circuses. 
</P>
<P>
But Buster has been to the big-top now, and has come to the conclusion that 
it's him against the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, people doubt my ability!" Douglas pops off. 
</P>
<P>
He is grievously offended that someone might actually be fool enough to favor a 
professionally undefeated former Olympian over a four-time loser who has fought 
three opponents in 24 months. That somebody must be pretty stupid to bet 
against someone of Douglas' obvious stature, a man who needed only nine rounds 
to do away with the much-feared Wimpy Halstead. 
</P>
<P>
Buster, don't be that way. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that you flattened Mike Tyson was evidence that good things come to 
those who wait, not that good things come to those who are great. 
</P>
<P>
That was you, if you will kindly recall, who spent somewhere between seven to 
13 seconds in a prostrate condition on a bed of canvas that February evening in 
Tokyo, put there by a Tyson knuckle sandwich. Don't make us sorry you got up. 
</P>
<P>
As fond as we have been of the Buster Douglas who came along to give hope to 
the hopeless by slaying boxing's dragon, that's how disappointed we are to hear 
him contending now that Tyson was nothing much to begin with, that the only 
reason anybody thought he was anything special was that "you been telling him 
for five years how great he is." 
</P>
<P>
Silly us, to have thought Mike Tyson was a great boxer. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last six months, we have appreciated having Buster Douglas as the 
resident king of the ring, but if we have to endure continued shooting off of 
his mouth, we won't be particularly sorry to see the knocking off of his block. 
</P>
<P>
"Holyfield will go down," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
"When?" someone asked, meaning the round. 
</P>
<P>
"As of November," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back up, Buster. Back up.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summer night air is thick with sweat and Southern accents. McCormick Field, 
tired after 66 years, creaks under the weight of 4,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Some have come to take advantage of "Thirsty Thursday," when a 24-ounce beer 
costs a buck. Others have come to chat with their neighbors while holding their 
children by their shirttails. Still others have come to watch a baseball game 
between the Class A Asheville Tourists and the Charleston (W.Va.) Wheelers. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is this 70-year-old man wearing a saggy face and baggy baseball 
uniform. He has come to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the clown . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The end of the sentence comes out garbled over the scratchy public address 
system and Max Patkin, the clown prince of baseball, is greeted by only a few 
cheers and mostly stares as he runs from the third base dugout to his position 
in the first base coaching box. 
</P>
<P>
He mimics the fielders during an infield drill. He spits on himself. He throws 
dirt on himself. He lies across first base. He yells out a barely audible joke 
about chicken cacciatore. 
</P>
<P>
Some people are laughing. Most are still just staring. 
</P>
<P>
Patkin stops. 
</P>
<P>
"Make 'em laugh, damn it," he whispers. "Make 'em laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Max Patkin has been doing this for 45 years, about 80 shows a year, a total of 
about 3,500 shows. A ton of dirt has been thrown on his face, gallons of water 
have been spit like a geyser from his mouth, 10,000 bad jokes have been told, 
and children have laughed a million laughs. 
</P>
<P>
But what makes baseball clown Max Patkin proudest is that he has never failed 
to show up for work. 
</P>
<P>
He jumped off a burning plane after it landed in Fayetteville, Ark., to make a 
date. He once took a cab 300 miles on a flat tire through the middle of Mexico 
to make a date. 
</P>
<P>
He has performed even when he was so sick others could not bear to stand near 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in Monterrey, Mexico, 20 years ago, and I had Montezuma's revenge," 
Patkin remembered. "All of a sudden, the guy on first base steals second. No 
big deal, but then the first baseman steals second. And the umpire steals 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm standing there all alone when I realize I've had an accident in my pants." 
</P>
<P>
But he finished the show. He always finishes the show. 
</P>
<P>
He has been cursed by minor league managers who won't let him dress in their 
clubhouses, victimized by players who rub analgesic balm in his athletic 
supporter, and yet Max Patkin has always been there at the end. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as he nears the end of the time when he is still physically able to 
perform, Patkin is still here. He is in the midst of doing 60 shows this 
summer, in minor league ballparks from central Florida to central Canada, from 
Burlington to Billings. 
</P>
<P>
He still wears a uniform he wore 30 years ago. He still washes his cap by hand 
so it won't shrink. 
</P>
<P>
And by that part of America he still touches, he has not been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an autograph session with him this year, and the line stretched from 
here to the freeway," said Stan Naccarato, president of the Tacoma (Wash.) 
Tigers. "The man is an institution within himself." 
</P>
<P>
Added Larry Schmittou, who owns teams in Nashville and Huntsville, Ala.: "The 
man is like the Globetrotters. He is part of history." 
</P>
<P>
Now, if Max Patkin would only believe that. In becoming part of history, 
baseball's clown has been disillusioned by it. 
</P>
<P>
His act was never easy, but never has it been as hard as lately. People don't 
laugh at old men with a handful of teeth anymore, they laugh at chickens. 
People don't like vaudeville, they like scoreboard videos. 
</P>
<P>
Patkin is wondering these days if their laughter has ever been worth his pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I quit, who is going to give a damn?" he said in an interview earlier 
this summer near his Philadelphia area home. "Really now, who gives a damn 
about a baseball clown? 
</P>
<P>
"People will think about me and say, 'He used to be a funny.' And that's it. 
That's my story. Used to be funny. Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at Asheville comes alive. Not because of Max, but because their team 
has scored three runs while he is coaching first base in the bottom of the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
As is his custom, he will move to the third base coaching box in the bottom of 
the fourth inning, then back to first base in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not thinking ahead. Struggling with a distracted crowd, he is taking 
it one joke at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey kids," he shouts to the children while sticking out his neck and 
scrunching his lips up underneath his big nose. "You better be good, or you'll 
look like this." 
</P>
<P>
He then opens his mouth to show his one prominent bottom tooth. Most of the 
rest of his mouth is empty, as two years ago he refused to replace a set of bad 
dentures. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't brush your teeth, they will look like this!" he shouts to the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
When he still gets little response, he screams, "What a crowd! I had more 
people in my bed last night." 
</P>
<P>
The children giggle. Their parents shake their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him five or six years ago, and just had to come back when I heard he was 
here," said John Stallings, a football coach who brought two carloads of 
friends from nearby Burnsville, N.C. "He's still great . . . but it looks like 
he's aged some." 
</P>
<P>
Max Patkin likes to say that it started during the war, in 1944, when he faced 
Joe DiMaggio while pitching for a Navy team in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit a home run off me, and I followed him around the bases," Patkin 
recalled. "I don't know why, I just did. I was just a ham. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon, admirals were coming out and asking when that goofy guy would be 
pitching again." 
</P>
<P>
Truthfully, though, he admits it probably started the day he looked in a mirror 
and realized he looked, um, different. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how I look," he said. "I knew that because of my appearance, I was 
getting laughed at even when I wasn't trying to be funny. 
</P>
<P>
"On the field I make myself more grotesque than I am, but I know how it is. I 
finally figured, the man upstairs makes you a certain way, that's the way it is 
supposed to be. Maybe the reason I was made this way was, I supposed to make 
people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ron McKee, Asheville general manager: "Max is so ugly, people love him." 
</P>
<P>
It was with this understanding of his public perception that Patkin, a 
frustrated pitcher who never made it above the middle minor leagues, made his 
debut as a clown coach for owner Bill Veeck's Cleveland Indians in 1946. In his 
first game, he set fire to Hank Greenberg's shoes. He has been fooling players 
and fans ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Fooling most everyone, in fact, except himself. Because from the start, Patkin 
was uncomfortable with the difference between laughed with and laughed at. 
</P>
<P>
So uncertain of which applied to him in his early years, Patkin grew depressed. 
One day in 1951, he put his head in an oven and turned on the gas. 
</P>
<P>
"Feeling that I could not make a living in sports except through my funny 
appearance, I got depressed, nearly had a nervous breakdown," he said. "Then 
one day I could not go on . . . until I smelled the gas -- and it smelled 
terrible. It terrified me. I pulled out. I decided to give my life another 
try." 
</P>
<P>
Patkin still gets depressed from time to time as he lies in Ramada Inn or Days 
Inn or Holiday Inn beds on weekday afternoons in small-town America, waiting to 
perform at yet another tiny ballpark. He hopes the audience won't notice how 
these days, he must pause to catch his breath. He hopes the audience will be 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I am really very sensitive about the way I look," he said. "I'll be 
walking down the street and somebody will call me ugly and I will shoot back 
with, 'I make a living looking this way. What's your excuse?' 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not funny. I never have gotten the woman I want. I take a lot of 
abuse. It's not funny." 
</P>
<P>
He thought he had the woman he wanted once, about 30 years ago, and married 
her. But he said that after he caught her cheating on him, she sneaked up and 
hit him over the head with a hammer, fracturing his skull. Thirteen years ago, 
they were divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what the darndest thing about that hammer incident was?" he asked. "A 
couple of weeks later, I attended this testimonial dinner for Tommy Lasorda. 
The emcee, Joe Garagiola, looked at me sitting on the dais with my head 
bandaged. He announced to everybody that my wife had just tried to kill me by 
hitting me over the head with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know what? Everybody laughed. They thought it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Patkin is sweating through his old uniform and Montreal Expos cap, which he 
wears sideways, as he moves into the third base coaching box for the bottom of 
the fourth inning in Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
It is a quick inning, but he moves quickly. He blows kisses to the women in the 
stands. He calls time out and kisses the batter. He spits on himself again. He 
throws more dirt on his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Then it is time for his nightly jitterbug dance. With the poor public address 
system, few can hear the music of "Rock Around the Clock." But the 70-year-old 
man dances anyway, twisting his feet into the ground and gyrating his 
double-jointed body as if he didn't care if anyone was watching. Or wasn't 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the bad speakers, that whole part of my act was blown," Patkin said 
later, shaking his head. "But, hell. Did you see the children who watched me? 
Did you see their faces?" 
</P>
<P>
Patkin gets $1,500 a game. That does not sound like much compared to the 
$5,000-$10,000 commanded nightly by one of major league baseball's top 
attractions, the Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
But comparing Patkin to the Chicken is like comparing grass fields to 
artificial turf. And Patkin is vocal about the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Chicken is a little bit of an ass," Patkin said. "I remember in 
Louisville one year, they invited both of us to the same game. I thought we 
would alternate innings, but the Chicken said I could only work the seventh 
inning, or he was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"The management had to give in to him, and by the time I got out there, the 
home team was losing, 8-1, and nobody was watching. The Chicken is just nasty." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference between the Chicken and Patkin is that because Patkin's 
show involves actual game situations, he has not worked a major league game in 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much at stake for them to worry about me coaching third base 
during a big inning," Patkin said, slipping into another story. "I remember the 
time in Toronto, I was working a big game between the Blue Jays and Baltimore. 
With Jim Palmer pitching against John Mayberry of Toronto in the second inning, 
I yelled out, 'Fastball! Fastball!' from the third base coaching box. Just a 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
"But that dumb Palmer, he still throws a fastball! Mayberry hit a homer and 
Toronto won and I'll never forget how Palmer just stared at me." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if Patkin had remained a major league act, he might have become as 
sterile as today's mascots, and thus deprived of adding to his rich and unusual 
history. He certainly would not have had as many good stories, such as being 
Lasorda's roommate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working a Spokane game when Tommy was managing there, and he let me stay 
in his room that night," Patkin remembered. "But he told me, if his team lost, 
I could not talk the whole night. And sure enough, they lost. So we go home and 
he doesn't let me talk for two hours and I'm getting all itchy. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally he says, 'OK, I'll let you say one thing.' I say, 'Tommy, you're a 
no-good SOB.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is the bottom of the fifth inning, Patkin's final appearance on the 
Asheville field, and he makes it his best. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the first-base coaching box, he actually drops his pants. He covers 
his brightly colored undershorts with dirt. Then, having taken a big swig of 
water from a soda can, he begins spouting the water in the air. High spouts, 
and lots of them. It is the feat that, to this day, makes his fans wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"That water thing always amazed me," Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia said. "I 
don't think any of us ever figured out how he did it." 
</P>
<P>
After the inning, he goes into his grand finale. He runs to home plate, crawls 
between the catcher's legs, grabs a bat, holds it at the wrong end, swings at a 
practice pitch, hits a grounder, runs to third base, gets tagged out and then 
thrown out of the game by a laughing umpire. 
</P>
<P>
By now, the beers have been set aside, the socializing has stopped, and the 
crowd is roaring. Patkin leaves the field to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Patkin has had an operation for a herniated disk. He has bone spurs on his 
feet. He has refused to undergo an operation for torn cartilage in his knee. He 
carries a blood-pressure card in his wallet, next to the index cards that 
remind him of his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
This is a clown's life? 
</P>
<P>
He lives with his brother, Edward, in a condominium at King of Prussia, Pa. 
They have two dogs and a cat. The dogs are so old, they can no longer control 
their bladders, so one room is completely papered for them. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors complain about the smell, but Patkin ignores them. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it stinks," he said. "But how can you get rid of something you have had 
for 13 years?" 
</P>
<P>
Minor league officials often ask him if he is planning to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had him here 11 straight years because he keeps telling me that every 
year is his last," Asheville's McKee said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Patkin retirement threat has been just that, but he wonders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting older, my moves aren't what they used to be," he said. "I don't 
care about the money, I want to be funny. And I worry, are they still liking 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago his career was given a second life by an appearance in 
the move "Bull Durham." Baseball's minor league officials have since crowned 
him, "The King of Baseball," in a corny ceremony annually honoring an 
individual's contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasures of such achievements, though, have been dimmed by the constant 
travel and pressures. Just last summer, the manager of the team in Boise, Ida., 
team would not let Patkin dress in the clubhouse, and would not let his players 
help him. Patkin cursed him throughout his performance. 
</P>
<P>
"When my dance is over, if people are not laughing at me, oh, that would be 
terrible," Patkin said. "That's why, when I go out there and things are bad, I 
just keep telling myself, 'Make 'em laugh, damn it! Make 'em laugh!' "
