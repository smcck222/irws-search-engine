A physician said that an 87-year-old woman who was presumed dead and taken from 
a Springfield, Ohio, nursing home to a funeral parlor for embalming had 
apparently suffered a heart attack, then revived. Carrie Stringfellow was 
reported in fair condition after coming within minutes of being embalmed by 
mortician Dennis Porter over the weekend. "Our conjecture is that she probably 
suffered a heart seizure and her heart probably stopped at the nursing home," 
said Dr. Ernest Henson, of Mercy Medical Center in Springfield.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: A CASE THAT REFUSES TO DIE EVEN AFTER DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My relationship with Johan Bertil Sagermark was a case of journalistic 
trickle-down. 
</P>
<P>
One day in early 1982, Sagermark managed, against all odds, to get the 
editor-in-chief on the telephone, briefly. The editor-in-chief told him to call 
the editor. The editor told him to call the city editor. 
</P>
<P>
The city editor told him to call me. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began our involuntary relationship. Every week or so for more than two 
years Sagermark would call me and explain the latest twist in his battle with 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to remain in this country as a 
refugee fleeing persecution in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
He was in his 60s, married to a Guatemalan woman half his age, and living in 
Escondido. He had some esoteric dispute with the Swedish government about the 
safety of construction cranes. 
</P>
<P>
After that I was lost. I was not helped by hours and hours of listening to 
Sagermark's heavily accented English nor by his hundreds of pages of documents. 
</P>
<P>
When my interest flagged, Sagermark would remind me that, by corporate 
declension, I had been ordered by the editor-in-chief to listen to him. That 
was usually good for an additional 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
I was not alone. Sagermark was carrying on correspondence with reporters 
throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He crisscrossed the country by Greyhound, possibly the nation's best-traveled 
and most media-minded illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
One newspaper clipping showed him wearing a sandwich board telling people not 
to buy a Volvo. Another story said many newspaper and government offices issued 
orders not to let him past the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
Sagermark and I became estranged in mid-1984. More precisely, I got a promotion 
that provided just enough authority to order someone else to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a cool decade after his visa had expired, he lost his fight with the 
INS and was put on a jet to Stockholm. He threatened to sneak back via Tijuana 
but never did. Instead he died of cancer at age 67 a year later. 
</P>
<P>
His spirit survives, however. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell is dunning Sagermark's widow, Francesca, for $2,142.62, plus court 
costs and interest. The company says Francesca ran up a big bill making calls 
to Sweden to talk to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Francesca is represented by the Legal Aid Society. She filed a countersuit 
charging that Pac Bell reneged on a payment plan and inflicted great emotional 
distress by making her use a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
Trial is set for Monday in Vista Superior Court. The case has been going on for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters are getting calls about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When in San Diego . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who says San Diego isn't cosmopolitan? 
</P>
<P>
The elevator down from the 34th floor of Symphony Towers was packed with San 
Diego businessmen who had just attended Tuesday's United Jewish Federation 
breakfast with U.S. Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
The animated conversation was in Hebrew. Then one of the businessmen said 
enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
"This is America," he protested. "Speak Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Whereupon the conversation shifted flawlessly into espanol. We monolinguals 
were impressed.

Political notes:

* The sexual harassment claims against Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) earned him 
a spot Monday in Jay Leno's monologue on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine any woman," said Leno, "who would check into a motel with a 
man named Bates." 
</P>
<P>
* John Hartley complains he's had trouble getting crime statistics from the San 
Diego Police Department since challenging Councilwoman Gloria McColl. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, say the police. Hartley has had two ride-alongs and gets the same stats 
as everybody else.

* If you think the San Diego County delegation in Sacramento is unenlightened, 
you should look northward.

LANDMARK OR NOT, BUILDING SEEMS DOOMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To some, the old citrus packing house visible from Interstate 15 in Escondido 
is a cultural treasure, a link to the past when commerce in North County was 
measured in train car loads of fruit, not the retail sales of a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, some history buffs had hoped that the sprawling Cal Fame 
building, the arched behemoth of a structure constructed in 1934 and one of the 
largest packing houses of oranges in the nation, would ultimately end up as a 
historical landmark, a bridge to an earlier day. It was, after all, the last 
orange citrus packing house in town when it shut down in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the U.S. Postal Service, which purchased the property on Mission Avenue 
in September for $2.65 million after nearly a year of research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sigh of Relief 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness, some folks sighed. The old packing house is in government 
hands. The feds have congressional marching orders to save old buildings 
whenever possible. It'll be renovated and restored and even if it'll be filled 
with letters and boxes instead of lemons and oranges, the structure will be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
The postal people had the same notion. They studied the historical significance 
of the building and agreed it should be added to the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Then they studied it a little bit more. 
</P>
<P>
The ceiling of the front offices would have to be raised to allow for a 
security observation deck. But the raised ceiling, they realized, would ruin 
the visual integrity of the building's art deco facade. The building's 
foundation would have to be reinforced to make it more earthquake safe. Some of 
the huge wood beams were rotting, so the ceiling -- with the skylight running 
the length of the spine -- would have to be reconstructed. And all those wiring 
and plumbing problems. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The engineers shook their heads. The architects shook their heads. The budget 
crunchers shook their heads when they heard it would cost upwards of $1 million 
to renovate the building -- even before they started their own interior 
</P>
<P>
work to turn the packing house into a post office. 
</P>
<P>
So the U.S. Postal Service is going to tear the old building down. It's 
cheaper, and will be more efficient, to build a new post office from the ground 
up, officials decided. 
</P>
<P>
This may come as good news to persons who are concerned about timely mail 
delivery and the cost of postage. 
</P>
<P>
But the news has some people shaking their heads with disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Losing the Continuity' 
</P>
<P>
"This building represents our past, and they're important for us to preserve," 
said Woody Zuill, chairman of Escondido's Historic Preservation Policy 
Committee and a professional sign maker. "As we demolish these historic 
buildings, we are erasing our past faster than our culture can withstand. We're 
losing the continuity of a community, the cohesiveness of our culture." 
</P>
<P>
Postal Service officials are sympathetic. But they note, ever so politely so as 
to not point the finger of blame at anyone else, that no one else in town had 
tried to preserve the old building, either, and that they shouldn't be cast as 
the insensitive villains. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Postal Service even has a person whose whole job is to study the 
historic significance of buildings and properties purchased for post offices to 
determine whether, and how, they can be preserved as an anecdote for history. 
In this case, it's Steve Stielstra, who works out of San Bruno. 
</P>
<P>
Using National Historic Preservation Act guidelines as established by Congress, 
Stielstra studied the Cal Fame building to determine its historic importance. 
It was so important, he concluded, it should be included in the National 
Registry of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
But that designation didn't necessarily mean the building would be preserved. 
"We evaluated the building in great detail, in terms of its structural 
integrity, the building code parameters, and whether it would be a safe place 
for the public as well as our own employees. We brought in outside consultants 
-- engineers and architects -- and they all studied it. 
</P>
<P>
"But our public service mandate is to move the mail, and that requires an 
efficient facility and modern processing equipment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite a Surprise' 
</P>
<P>
When the Postal Service recently announced its decision to tear the building 
down, there was nothing that local agencies could do about it. "It came as 
quite a surprise to us," said Dawn Suitts, a senior planner at Escondido City 
Hall whose job, among other things, is to monitor the preservation of local 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Postal Service was in touch with us, they were asking us questions 
like, 'How can we get the building placed on the national registry?' We thought 
that was great. To now decide to tear it down," Suitts said, "is a 180-degree 
turn from that position. It's an important building, very important, to our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The building was constructed in 1934 by the Sunkist Packing Co. as a packing 
house for the Escondido Orange Assn., a cooperative of local growers who helped 
supply top-grade oranges to the national distributor. It was a state-of-the-art 
packing house in those days, serving more than 500 local growers and winning 
trade magazine publicity for its refrigeration units. Hundreds of persons 
worked inside during the peak of the season, a beehive of activity as they 
sized, packed and loaded the fruit onto railroad cars parked alongside the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, the independent Paramount Citrus Assn. purchased the packing house, 
changing the name on the building from Sunkist to Cal Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Because of declining business, the packing house closed down in late 1987 -- 
about the same time the U.S. Postal Service was looking for a site for a new 
post office to serve Escondido. The current post office, at Second Avenue and 
Orange Street, is no longer large enough to accommodate Escondido's mail 
business and, furthermore, the lease on the privately owned building expires in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Government real estate agents located five other possible building sites in 
Escondido. Three were deemed to be too far outside the downtown area to be 
accessible to customers and to be central for mail carriers. A fourth site was 
a mobile home park, and more than 100 residents would have to be relocated. The 
fifth site was too near a residential area where there's a 10 p.m.-to-7 a.m. 
business curfew. Mail trucks start arriving at local post offices at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Fame building got the nod, and Paramount, which operates other packing 
houses in the state, sold it. Construction of the new post office is scheduled 
to begin next spring, with completion by early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the post office's point of view," Zuill concedes. "It's a matter 
of economics, and not too many people will say we don't need a better post 
office. And putting a post office there is better than, say, a nuclear missile 
silo." 
</P>
<P>
Zuill said he wishes, in retrospect, that someone in town -- a real estate 
agent, a developer, City Hall or someone -- would have anticipated the 
building's ultimate vacancy and have tried to find another occupant. Even a 
mini-storage warehouse or a repair shop might have been able to use the basic 
structure, Zuill said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, another piece of the town's history is being scraped away and a guy 
who moves in next month will never know what was once here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the packing house itself is doomed, archive-quality photographs of 
the building have been located and preserved and, along with a detailed written 
documentary of the building, will be forwarded to the Library of Congress in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, Stielstra of the post office said, a copy of that historical 
research and the old pictures will be made available for local display. 
</P>
<P>
Where? Well, the local historical society's museum at Grape Day Park, next to 
City Hall, would seem appropriate. Or maybe it will be framed and hung in the 
lobby of the new post office -- for persons to view as they wait in line for 
stamps.

PORT COMMISSIONERS URGE UNIFORM FARE RATE FOR TAXIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego port commissioners Tuesday called for a uniform fare rate for cab 
companies that serve the airport, with one commissioner warning that it might 
be necessary to establish a taxi franchise at Lindbergh Field if the current 
rate system is not changed. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer called the current system of variable rates "a 
rip-off." Under this system, cab companies are allowed to set their own fares, 
up to a maximum rate, which is changed periodically. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer warned that if a uniform rate is not established, the San Diego 
Unified Port District might recommend a taxi franchise at Lindbergh Field, and 
at the same time do away with most of the 150 cabs from different companies 
that are allowed at the airport every day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Silly Idea' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a silly idea to go to deregulation," said Wolfsheimer. He added 
that since the Port District runs the airport, port commissioners also have the 
authority to set taxi rates for trips originating at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
Variable rates, which resulted from local deregulation of the industry 10 years 
ago, have spurred hundreds of complaints from tourists and local citizens 
alike, who feel they are being cheated. It is not unusual for a passenger to 
pay, say, $15 for a ride from the airport to a Mission Valley hotel with one 
company, and only $10 for a return trip in another cab. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Wolfsheimer and other commissioners urged the Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board, which regulates the taxi industry, to institute a uniform 
rate. The MTDB is finishing a monthlong survey of about 1,500 cab patrons to 
learn if the public favors uniform rates. Except for a handful of small 
independent companies, most local cab firms have come out in favor of a uniform 
rate system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
System Rejected 
</P>
<P>
The subject of using a separate meter for cabs authorized to work at the 
airport was briefly discussed and rejected. Anthony Palmeri, vice president and 
general manager of Yellow Cab, warned that a two-meter system is used in New 
Orleans and has caused more problems than it has solved. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said that uniform rates would also help the congestion at 
Lindbergh Field and improve service. Occasionally, problems arise when 
disgruntled drivers, hoping for a long haul and bigger fare, refuse to take 
passengers to hotels at nearby Harbor and Shelter islands. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officials said that uniform rates would also end the practice of 
fare shopping at the airport, which slows down the taxi line. Under a uniform 
system, it would be "first up, first out," they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidy Suggested 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of uniform rates have charged that such a system would punish 
seniors and low-income residents, who are currently able to shop around for low 
fares. However, Palmeri suggested that the MTDB subsidize fares for the poor, 
like a program in effect in San Francisco. In San Francisco, cab companies turn 
over a percentage of their fares to a government agency, which uses the revenue 
to subsidize cab rides for low-income passengers, said Palmeri. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is the only major city in California that does not have uniform cab 
fares.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREE CLINIC GETS EMERGENCY GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Bay Hospital District has approved a $60,000 emergency grant for the 
beleaguered family planning program at the South Bay Free Clinic in Hermosa 
Beach. But it declined to approve additional money to support services for two 
years, saying that insufficient information was presented to justify the need. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic, which expects to lose as much as $350,000 in family planning and 
matching grant money as a result of state budget cuts, had asked for $226,600. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Valera, hospital district executive director, said the board granted the 
money to cover the clinic's cash-flow problems. Craig A. Vincent-Jones, clinic 
development officer, said $60,000 is a "significant help." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital district's action came one day before the free clinic closed its 
Teen Advocate program, which had been funded with family planning money. 
</P>
<P>
That program trained teen-agers to make school presentations on pregnancy 
prevention and counsel other teen-agers.

AIDS CASE SLAYER SENTENCED TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man who said he helped an AIDS victim commit suicide was sentenced 
Tuesday to state prison for second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
A jury on July 11 convicted John Cleaves, 43, of San Diego in the death of 
Dennis Eaton, 40. Cleaves testified that he merely aided Eaton in committing 
suicide because Eaton was depressed over his illness. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton's fully clothed body was found Sept. 13 in his Hillcrest apartment. He 
had been hogtied and strangled with a bathrobe sash. San Diego Superior Court 
Judge Louis Boyle imposed the maximum sentence of 15 years to life and fined 
Cleaves $100. 
</P>
<P>
The foreman of the jury that convicted Cleaves, the Rev. Paul Pulliam, a 
Presbyterian minister from La Mesa, said in an interview that the jury believed 
Cleaves' story of helping Eaton commit suicide. But Pulliam said Cleaves 
crossed the line and became a participant in the death rather than an observer, 
which made it murder.

LAWYER SAYS D.A. OFF-TARGET IN 2 KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney representing the families of two Mexican men killed by a 
now-defunct border anti-crime squad composed of San Diego policemen and U.S. 
Border Patrol officers has challenged the version of the deaths presented by 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the office of San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller informed San 
Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen that an investigation had determined that the 
shootings of last Dec. 21 were justified. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office determined that officers opened fire near the 
border in self-defense after one of the two victims had shot a pistol at them 
in an apparent attempt to rob the five-member anti-crime unit, which consisted 
of three U.S. Border Patrol agents and two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
However, C. Anthony Valladolid, a San Diego attorney who said he is pursuing 
the case on behalf of the families of the two victims, contended Tuesday that 
his inquiry showed the men were wrongly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our belief that the attack was not precipitated by a shot being fired or 
any violent act," said Valladolid, who declined to provide further details. He 
said he is pursuing possible civil claims against the city and the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than 70 Shots Fired 
</P>
<P>
The two dead men -- Enrique Estrada Rodriguez, 28, and Luis Enrique Armena 
Corrales, 19, both of Tijuana -- died of multiple gunshot wounds. The district 
attorney's office found that the officers fired more than 70 shots at the 
suspects after Estrada fired at the officers "without warning." 
</P>
<P>
Two men who accompanied the victims that night later admitted to Mexican police 
that they had intended to rob the officers, whom they mistook in the darkness 
for undocumented border crossers, according to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Near Estrada's body, police say they found a small .22-caliber revolver from 
which one bullet had been fired, the district attorney's office said. A toy gun 
was also found in the waistband of his pants, said Douglas C. Gregg, a deputy 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Less than nine months before the December shootings, authorities say, Estrada 
had been shot by the same anti-crime squad in about the same area -- also when 
he and his companions attempted to rob the uniformed officers. Estrada was 
ultimately convicted of attempted armed robbery and placed on probation, the 
district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Members of Border Unit 
</P>
<P>
The officers involved in the shooting were members of the Border Crime 
Prevention Unit, composed of U.S. border agents and San Diego police officers. 
The unit patrolled the border region for five years until it was taken out of 
action earlier this year, after the controversial shootings last Jan. 4 of two 
other Mexican men, who police say also attempted to rob the officers. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the families of those two men also contends that they were 
wrongfully shot, and is planning civil suits. 
</P>
<P>
During the life of the unit, officers assigned to it shot 44 people, killing 
18. Authorities said all the shootings were justified. 
</P>
<P>
The unit has since been replaced by a similar outfit composed entirely of San 
Diego policemen. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings on both Dec. 21 and Jan. 4 took place just north of the 
U.S.-Mexico boundary line in San Diego, along a river levee that is a favorite 
crossing point for immigrants entering the United without papers. The area is 
west of the port of entry at San Ysidro.

Nancy Hoover Hunter claimed that she was entitled to three residences, half of 
two others, part ownership in 23 companies, and three promissory notes totaling 
$61,200 that officials seized in the aftermath of the J. David &amp; Co. 
bankruptcy, according to the former bankruptcy trustee of the J. David estate. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Louis Metzger, testifying Tuesday in Hunter's 
fraud and tax-evasion trial, told jurors that Hunter filed a claim asking for a 
Rancho Santa Fe "mansion," a house in La Jolla, and a ski lodge in Deer Valley, 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said the Rancho Santa Fe residence, which she shared with J. David 
(Jerry) Dominelli, was a mansion with a guest house, swimming pool, and both 
gasoline and diesel fuel pumps. "It was a huge place, beautifully done," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter also claimed ownership of a Mercedes-Benz 300, mink and sable coats, and 
10 thoroughbred racehorses, Metzger said. Hunter made the claim after the 
seizure of these and other assets by bankruptcy officials in February, 1984, 
which resulted when angry investors made a run on the J. David investment 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say that many of the properties and goods consolidated were 
bought with investors' funds that were stolen by Dominelli while he operated a 
huge Ponzi scheme out of his La Jolla investment house. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Hunter played a key role in the fraud, which bilked 
about 1,200 people out of as much as $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
The defense in the 234-count trial maintains that Hunter was unaware of 
Dominelli's activities because he and his associates lied to her.

A 1986 Isuzu Trooper believed to have been driven by Roger Sing Ip when he 
allegedly shot and killed a Mission Bay High School student is being studied 
for evidence, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are awaiting results of tests that could show microscopic amounts 
of metal filings or gunpowder residue on the car, Detective Bill Nulton said. 
</P>
<P>
The car was recovered Friday from a garage in Alhambra, east of Los Angeles, 
and returned to San Diego on Saturday, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had been searching for Ip, a 32-year-old Pacific Beach restaurateur, and 
his car since the July 10 shooting of Kurt Von Yokes, a 15-year-old La Jollan. 
Ip, co-owner of the China Inn restaurant, fled to Los Angeles after the death 
but surrendered to authorities July 27 after his home and business were 
searched and a warrant was issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Ip pleaded innocent to murder charges. He is being held in 
County Jail in lieu of $1-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the shooting, Yokes and two friends riding in a car almost 
collided with Ip's Isuzu Trooper at Bayard Street and Grand Avenue in Pacific 
Beach, police said. After a brief exchange of words, Ip followed the car to a 
house on Christopher Street and shot Yokes as he and another passenger got out, 
they said.

A judge Tuesday ordered a delay in the murder trial of Stacy Butler, accused of 
killing a San Diego police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Louis Boyle delayed the trial from Sept. 7 until Jan. 8 at 
the request of Butler's attorneys, who said they needed more time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, 25, is accused of killing Officer Jerry Hartless on Jan. 31, 1988. 
Police believe Hartless was running after Butler in Southeast San Diego when 
Butler shot the officer in the forehead. Hartless, 24, was in a coma for three 
weeks before he died. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is seeking special circumstances in the case, 
making Butler eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted of first-degree 
murder.

CAREER PROSECUTOR BRANIFF SWORN IN AS U.S. ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Braniff, a career federal prosecutor with a strong record in military 
procurement fraud cases, was sworn in Tuesday as U.S. attorney for San Diego 
and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff, 48, is now the district's chief federal prosecutor and is responsible 
for representing the United States in civil and criminal proceedings in state 
and federal district courts. His territory is officially called the Southern 
District of California. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really quite proud," Braniff said. "I'm excited about the position. It's 
always been sort of the pinnacle. Now, to reach that position is indeed quite 
rewarding. I've come to appreciate the job even more now that I've been 
appointed." 
</P>
<P>
Braniff has worked for almost a year as interim U.S. attorney and succeeds 
Peter Nunez, who stepped down last August to join a law firm. Braniff was 
confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 31 and appointed by President Bush on Aug. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican, nominated Braniff for the position in 1988 
because of Braniff's experience in prosecuting drug traffickers and those 
involved with military procurement fraud. Braniff's selection as a permanent 
replacement for Nunez had been dependent on the outcome of the presidential 
election last November, insiders said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff transferred to the San Diego U.S. attorney's office in 1980 from 
Newark, N.J., where he was chief of the criminal division. He was sworn in as 
an assistant U.S. attorney for the Newark office in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff, born in New York and raised in New Jersey, is a paraplegic as a result 
of a 1960 auto accident. He was graduated from Rutgers University Law School in 
1969 after completing his undergraduate work at Seton Hall University in 1966.

STATEHOOD FOR WASHINGTON, D.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson's inflammatory demand for statehood for Washington, 
D.C., is full of specious arguments ("Statehood for the District of Columbia 
Would End Its Unfair Colonial Statue," Op-Ed Page, July 24). Instead of making 
a reasoned appeal, Jackson brings in a collection of adjectives and nouns which 
poison the debate, words such as scandal, stain, outrage, intolerable and such 
exaggerated assertions that the city endures "congressional occupation" and 
that a "shocking colonialism" is at work. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is pure sophistry and nonsense. If Washington deserves statehood 
because its population exceeds that of four of our states then what about New 
York City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco -- should they 
demand statehood as well? 
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia was carved out of Virginia and Maryland but it should 
not be too difficult a matter for the Congress to work out a system that would 
permit the citizens of Washington to participate in national elections even 
while the city remains a special enclave under the jurisdiction of the 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia and Maryland might each gain a House seat, but there would then be no 
need to give the residents the privilege denied all of the other cities of 
America of having the right to elect United States senators representing only 
one city. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid, though, that working out the complexities of such an arrangement 
would be of no interest to Jackson since his real intent is to provide himself 
with a senatorial seat that would otherwise be unavailable to him.

CHANGES IN U.S. FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to add another perspective to the column on the changing family by 
Tom Coleman (Op-Ed Page, July 26). Many years ago I was licensed as one of the 
first single-male foster parents in Los Angeles County. Over the ensuing years, 
my foster sons and I encountered numerous incidents of social, institutional, 
and governmental discrimination, some of which was humorous, some annoying, and 
some very serious. 
</P>
<P>
Socially, we discovered that some neighbors and many parents of the boys' 
friends strongly objected to the very notion of a single-male parent. Several 
times the boys were offered "good" homes by parents of friends. 
</P>
<P>
Institutionally, our most serious problems were with the schools. 
Administrators, secretaries, and teachers apparently felt duty-bound to express 
disapproval of our home to my boys, but never to me. 
</P>
<P>
Our worst problems were with some employees of the County Department of 
Children's Services. One supervisor "knew in her heart" that the county had 
made a mistake and that a single man should never be permitted to parent foster 
children. For 10 years that supervisor made my life difficult. Eventually, this 
woman, who had never met nor spoken to me, "taught me a lesson" by delaying 
permission for urgent extraordinary medical treatment for one of my sons. 
Although he might have died anyway, I will never know to what extent her 
personal hostility toward me may have contributed to his death. After his 
death, I gave up my foster parent license. 
</P>
<P>
All of my boys are adults now. Some have gone out of my life, but several are 
still very much a part of my "family." They are my "sons," but if for some 
reason I were to be institutionalized or hospitalized in an unconscious state, 
they would be refused access to me. Members of my biological family, who never 
approved of my role as foster parent, would gain decision-making control, 
including the power to refuse my sons any access to me. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that religions to which I do not subscribe and politicians whom 
I do not support have the power to decide for me who my "family" should be and, 
unless I pursue expensive, and sometimes contestable legal remedies, there is 
nothing I can do. Some variation of the "domestic partnership" concept would go 
a long way toward changing societal and institutional attitudes and protecting 
the interests and integrity of non-traditional families.

The nation does not need another state that is smaller than Rhode Island. And 
the way to end the "colonial status" of Washington is to let it revert to 
Maryland, the way the south portion reverted to Virginia.

It sounds like Jesse Jackson is planning on running for governor of "New

BACK TO THE MURK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first it seemed to be only a lovely nugget of perestroika-era irony. The 
Communist Party paper in Havana announced Friday that two Soviet publications 
were henceforth banned from Cuba for "justifying bourgeois democracy" and 
showing "fascination for the American way of life." It seems that the weekly 
Moscow News and the monthly Sputnik, former propaganda magazines that have been 
reborn under glasnost as promoters of reform, now contain ideas sanctioned by 
Moscow but considered too radical for the Cuban masses. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, the news was far from humorous. Three human rights 
activists, Elizardo Sanchez, Hubert Jerez and Hiram Abi Cobas, were arrested 
and detained by security police before dawn Sunday morning. The Cuban 
government has given no reason for the arrests and the men have not been 
formally charged. The three are the last leaders of the fledgling Human Rights 
Party, an illegal coalition of human rights groups whose cause is now in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The detentions and the magazine banning are the most recent stages of a general 
crackdown that began last September. Since then, Cuban authorities have 
arrested more than two dozen human rights activists, jailing most of them for 
petty crimes. The repression has not been limited to dissidents; in June, 
Castro publically tried and executed one of his top aides, General Arnaldo 
Ochoa Sanchez, for corruption and drug-trafficking. Other government officials 
have received the same treatment in the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of repression is thick and thickening. Even his Soviet 
benefactors are alarmed. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Cuba this past May, 
the tension between the leaders was evident as Castro enthusiastically 
described Cuban socialist achievments and Gorbachev replied politely but 
without vigor. 
</P>
<P>
It is clearer than ever that Cuban leader Fidel Castro has become completely 
unconcerned with human rights, due process or international opinion. He is 
sticking resolutely to his own repressive agenda, refusing to heed the new 
socialist call to reform and integrate with the rest of the world. Even as the 
rest of the socialist world turns slowly outward, Castro is steering Cuba 
straight back into the Stalinist murk.

REFORMS IN SOVIET UNION ONLY INCREASE APPETITES FOR SECRETS FROM THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS DANILOFF, Nicholas Daniloff, arrested by the KGB in 1986 in 
retaliation for the arrest of a Soviet agent in New York, is a visiting 
professor of journalism at Northeastern University in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sobering message of the Felix S. Bloch affair is that despite the reforms 
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Soviet spying against the United States will continue 
with intensity for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
We should not delude ourselves into thinking that improved political relations 
will reduce Soviet espionage. Ironically, glasnost and perestroika are actually 
increasing the incentives for Soviet intelligence to probe, recruit and steal. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Every nation seeks inside information about political decisions being made 
by its potential adversary that could affect national security. This is a 
constant. 
</P>
<P>
Every nation also needs to know the technical specifications of its adversary's 
weapons in order to design effective countermeasures. Another constant. 
</P>
<P>
Finally -- and this is particular to the Soviet Union -- the continuing decline 
of the Soviet economy forces Moscow to engage in heavy industrial espionage in 
Western Europe, Japan and the United States in an effort to catch up. The 
demand is heightened by Gorbachev's openness, which affords millions of Soviets 
a chance to travel abroad and hundreds of millions of television viewers to see 
how much better people in the West live. Soviet leaders are under intense 
pressure for quick improvements in the consumer economy. 
</P>
<P>
No one should be surprised that the KGB tries to recruit (and will continue to 
do so) Americans with access to top-secret information and high technology. 
During times of good superpower relations, Americans who are frustrated or 
greedy -- or both -- may actually believe that a little work for the Soviets 
will do little harm to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The question before us today is how to keep these tendencies under control. 
</P>
<P>
Improving counterintelligence capabilities at home is feasible. But as this 
happens, there will be a tendency for the espionage flow to move abroad, where 
it is more difficult to monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Handing over secret materials in foreign cities like Vienna or Cape Town is one 
increasingly popular method of evading the FBI. The Soviets maintain a large 
embassy in Mexico City. In the past, it has been a crucial place for scooping 
up American secrets such as those about an advanced U.S. communications 
satellite passed on by Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Another ruse that will become more important is the use of third-country 
nationals -- not just Soviet-Bloc citizens like East Germans and Bulgarians but 
citizens of Atlantic Alliance countries -- to get at American secrets. Thus we 
see the involvement of a Turkish citizen in the recent trial of American James 
Hall, who was court-martialed in March on espionage charges. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years, tens of thousand of Soviet citizens have immigrated to 
the United States and now a considerable number are coming as tourists, 
scientists, sailors. Undoubtedly, the KGB has planted a few agents among them. 
Will we wake up one day to find that one of our military attaches in Moscow has 
been slipping secrets to the KGB because he or she was recruited as a cadet by 
an emigre Russian teacher of the opposite sex at one of our military academies? 
</P>
<P>
American counterintelligence is going to need help, specifically: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Better cooperation -- including more expertise, both technical and human -- 
between the FBI and CIA in catching spies at home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increased coordination with counterintelligence organizations of NATO 
countries and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A bit of common sense by scientists and employees in high-tech and defense 
industries who have good reason to suspect something is amiss. Nobody wants to 
turn America into an informer society but a little awareness in libraries and 
elsewhere is desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tips by intelligence defectors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, of course, tips from the spies we have recruited ourselves -- and will 
continue to recruit -- within the Soviet Establishment, including the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Sad but true: In these sunnier days of Soviet-American relations, the spy wars 
go on.

NEW EDGE FOR MANAGEMENT ENDANGERS TREND TO BETTER-MANAGED CORPORATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There must have been a lot of quiet celebrating among top business executives 
recently when a Delaware court approved the $14-billion merger between Time 
Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. This was more than a legal decision. It 
signified that, as a practical matter, corporate chieftains had finally 
succeeded in barricading themselves against most hostile takeover offers. This 
is a bad development that harms U.S. economic competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and most Americans don't think hostile takeovers do any good. But they 
do. They represent one way to overhaul inefficient companies. More important, 
they prod companies to stay efficient. Few hostile takeovers actually occur. 
It's the mere threat that keeps executives on their toes. Like the rest of us, 
they do best when they're ultimately accountable for how well, or how badly, 
they perform. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, hostile takeovers were far rarer than now. Presumably, managers' 
freedom was greater. But lo, companies are being better managed now than then. 
Since 1981, business productivity has increased at an annual rate of 1.6%, 
double the 0.8% average between 1973 and 1980. Corporate research and 
development spending is now about 25% higher (as a share of gross national 
product) than in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
These improvements don't stem only from the disciplining effect of hostile 
takeovers. In the 1980s, many new pressures came to bear on management: tougher 
foreign competition, deregulation and the severity of the 1981-82 recession. 
But the statistics belie the claim that hostile takeovers are harming American 
business. What they really jeopardize is the job security and status of top 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
One can only marvel at the massive defenses they have now erected to shield 
themselves from this menace. They've persuaded 39 states to pass laws impeding 
management-opposed takeovers, reports the Investor Responsibility Research 
Center in Washington. Delaware's law is the most important, because nearly 
two-thirds of major U.S. companies are chartered in Delaware. This law 
effectively requires that a hostile purchaser buy 85% of a company's stock. 
Otherwise, the buyer must wait three years before being able to exercise full 
control over the company. 
</P>
<P>
Even the tiny opening afforded by the 85% rule is being quickly closed. 
Companies are rushing to create -- or expand -- ESOPs (employee stock ownership 
plans) that place 10% to 20% of the firm's stock in friendly hands. The idea is 
that employees would oppose most hostile takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, boards of directors are supposed to check abusive management power. 
In practice, they rarely do, because they're appointed by management. The 
significance of the Time-Warner decision is to sanctify this passivity. If 
directors are following a "strategic plan," theDelaware court said, they can 
ignore shareholders' views, even if -- as the court also found -- the main aim 
of the "strategic plan" is to entrench management. 
</P>
<P>
Great benefits are claimed for the Time-Warner merger. But after reviewing the 
evidence, Chancellor (Judge) William T. Allen of the Delaware Chancery Court 
concluded that business reasons were not "the transcendent aim of Time 
management or its board" in pursuing the merger. The main aim was to keep Time 
"independent" -- that is, prevent a hostile takeover. Allen doubted that 
maintaining the journalistic integrity of Time's magazines was a genuine 
concern, because the magazines will represent less than 25% of the new 
company's revenues. Its main businesses will be cable TV and movie production. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Allen blessed all this as "bona fide business strategic planning." The 
absurd result was that Time's directors were allowed to reject a hostile merger 
proposal from Paramount Communications favored by most shareholders. Paramount 
would have paid them $200 a share for Time stock; that was more than a 50% 
premium over Time's previous price. But Time's executives preferred to buy 
Warner for $70 a share, because the Time-Warner agreement guaranteed their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Why should anyone care about shareholders? First, they're not just rich 
individuals. Pension funds own a quarter of all common stock. Second, the 
shareholders' desire for profits keeps pressure on managers to improve 
efficiency and avoid waste -- including wasteful mergers. Hostile takeovers 
often break up unwieldy conglomerates formed by poor mergers. Most takeovers 
are still "friendly" between companies. In 1988, there were 2,258 mergers and 
acquisitions, reports W.T. Grimm &amp; Co., a consulting firm. Of these, only 
27 were "hostile." 
</P>
<P>
The result of Allen's decision and other anti-takeover measures will not be 
fewer mergers, only fewer takeovers opposed by management. There will be more 
"strategic planning" -- studies, task forces and meetings -- to create a legal 
record justifying rejection of unwanted offers. This sounds like unproductive 
make-work because it is. 
</P>
<P>
Congress could -- and should -- rewrite the takeover rules to put shareholders 
and managers on an equal footing. There's no constitutional bar to overriding 
state takeover laws. Corporate takeovers are clearly interstate commerce. The 
main issue here transcends fairness to shareholders and involves the 
competitiveness of our major companies. Short of bankruptcy, there needs to be 
some check on inept management. Hostile takeovers, a blunt instrument, are 
better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, Delaware is now making national economic policy -- and doing a bad 
job. Delaware favors management, because incorporation fees are a major source 
of state revenues. But Delaware's interests are not the nation's interests, and 
companies shouldn't be run mainly for top executives. Perhaps Congress will one 
day awake to these simple truths.

DEBATING LEGISLATIVE TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER A. ZELMAN, Walter A. Zelman is executive director of California 
Common Cause. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp has placed a new issue on California's political 
reform agenda. Last month, Van de Kamp announced he would sponsor an initiative 
that would, among other things, limit statewide elected officials to two 
consecutive terms and state legislators to 12 years of consecutive service in 
each house. 
</P>
<P>
In advocating term limits, Van de Kamp argued that "our system of government 
had hardened into a gridlock of caution, incumbency protection and the 
servicing of special interests." He concluded that the "drastic step" was 
necessary because "what we're doing now isn't working." 
</P>
<P>
The term-limitation idea is not really drastic or new. We limit Presidents, and 
26 states limit governors, to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
But no state limits terms of state legislators. Nor does the federal 
Constitution limit congressional terms. Thus, the Van de Kamp proposal is, in 
this respect at least, a radical one. Nevertheless, given certain conditions in 
California politics today, a reasonable case can be made for the imposition of 
such limits. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of that case is the reality that political competition is 
virtually extinct at the state level. In the last three legislative campaigns 
(1982, 1984, 1986), only three incumbents seeking reelection lost, and 273 
incumbents won. 
</P>
<P>
Reductions in electoral competition in turn yield reductions in legislative 
turnover. Electoral safety not only enables incumbents to stay where they are, 
it also discourages them from challenging other equally secure incumbents in 
other offices. While 49 new members entered the Assembly between 1978-82, only 
21 of the current 80 members have been elected in the last six years. Turnover 
rates are even lower in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Such low levels of competition and turnover may result in a loss of electoral 
and legislative vitality and the responsiveness of the Legislature to new ideas 
and changing political styles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the natural advantages (name identification, connections, etc.) 
held by incumbents, there would appear to be two main causes of today's low 
levels of legislative competition and turnover. The power of the Legislature to 
redraw legislative district boundaries generally results in safer seats for 
large numbers -- if not the majority -- of incumbents. During the last 10 to 20 
years, most parts of the state have grown increasingly competitive. 
Gerrymandered district lines can insulate the Legislature from this trend. 
</P>
<P>
And incumbents, who are able to raise almost unlimited sums from 
special-interest groups, maintain nearly insurmountable fund-raising advantages 
over potential challengers. In the non-election year of 1987, legislative 
candidates raised more than $25 million, 98% of it going to incumbents. During 
the 1988 elections, incumbents outspent all other candidates combined by almost 
5 to 1. Term limitations would address the incumbency-advantage problem. They 
would force more competition and turnover, especially since many incumbents 
would, as they approached their limit in one house, challenge incumbents in 
other races. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits also have disadvantages. There is value to experience and expertise 
in public office, and limitations that force out numerous high-quality 
lawmakers at the peak of their effectiveness could have undesirable impacts on 
the legislative process. In addition, term limits may increase 
conflict-of-interest pressures on some legislators, especially if the limits 
imposed are too stringent. 
</P>
<P>
Such a circumstance could reduce the productivity and energy of the 
Legislature, and it may expose many members to the influence of those -- 
special interests and others -- capable of easing a transition from public to 
private life. 
</P>
<P>
The key element in the case against term limits hinges on the democratic right 
of the electorate to elect whom it chooses, including incumbents. This argument 
has obvious merit. It would be even more compelling in a truly competitive 
political environment. This is not the case in today's California. The 
incumbent's right to seek reelection amounts to a virtual guarantee of 
reelection. Thus, allowing incumbents the right to unlimited terms carries the 
heavy price tag of seriously diminishing opportunities for competition, debate 
and choice. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious alternative means of generating competition entail redrawing 
legislative district boundaries and reducing the enormous advantages now 
afforded incumbents by the current mechanisms of campaign financing. Reforms 
such as a ban on non-election-year fund-raising, which reduces incumbents' 
advantages, or public financing, which increases challengers' chances, would 
unquestionably stimulate more political competition. A redistricting plan drawn 
by some entity other than legislative incumbents could also dramatically alter 
the non-competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of these reforms, term limitations seem more appealing. But such 
limits should allow for reasonably lengthy tenure in office and, and thus, for 
the development of adequate levels of experience and expertise. In addition, a 
term-limits proposal might be strengthened by the inclusion of certain ethics 
reforms, including revolving-door provisions and restrictions on outside earned 
income. These might reduce the conflict-of-interest dilemmas that term 
limitations can engender.

COUNTY ALTERS REPORT, REAPPROVES HOUSING PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
FOES OF AGOURA TRACT SAY SUPERVISORS ACTED TO DEFUSE SUIT OVER ENVIRONMENTAL 
STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what critics called an unusual admission of error, the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday retroactively changed an environmental impact 
report on a development the board had approved five months ago after bitter 
public debate. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report is now the subject of a lawsuit by environmentalists 
and homeowners seeking to overturn the board's March 2 approval of construction 
of 150 homes at Paramount Ranch in Agoura, the former site of the Renaissance 
Pleasure Faire. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the changes in the environmental report were meant to 
explain the benefits of the board's order reducing the project from 159 to 150 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for the Sierra Club and the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, charged that the county's real reason for 
altering the report was the lawsuit, which contends the report had inadequately 
evaluated alternatives to the developer's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The changes adopted unanimously by the board Tuesday included a reference to an 
economic study, prepared for developer Brian Heller, that contends that 
alternatives to Heller's proposal were too costly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of extraordinary," said Carlyle W. Hall Jr., the plaintiffs' lawyer. 
"They're confessing that they made a mistake. . . . I guess they feel they're 
in a bad legal position and needed to do something." 
</P>
<P>
The board's resolution Tuesday said the supervisors "inadvertently and 
prematurely" approved the project in March without completing the environmental 
report, leaving gaps that were filled by Tuesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, described the board's 
action as remedying a minor oversight. 
</P>
<P>
In March, "it would have been better to have closed the hearing, indicated our 
intent to approve the cases and requested staff to prepare the final documents 
for board action at a later date," a statement from Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard D. Weiss, senior deputy county counsel, maintained that the board's 
action was not motivated by the lawsuit. But he conceded that "anything that 
would strengthen the final environmental document . . . is going to benefit the 
county" in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the board, Hall disputed the findings of Heller's study and said 
the board "cannot reopen the record, selectively admit only certain items . . . 
close the record and re-enact its March 2 actions without reopening the public 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
But Weiss responded that there has already been sufficient public comment on 
Heller's economic analysis, which was made public in December. 
</P>
<P>
"This matter was the subject of protracted public hearings," Weiss said. "The 
county has heard the nature of the opposition and understands it." 
</P>
<P>
In Antonovich's statement, the supervisor reiterated his support for the 
project. The board's action on Tuesday re-enacted all the conditions Antonovich 
and the board had imposed in March, including the establishment of an 
open-space buffer zone between the project and neighboring National Park 
Service property. 
</P>
<P>
In the background during the board's deliberations earlier this year was an 
attempt by the Park Service and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to 
acquire the development site for use as a park. Heller has not responded to an 
offer by the conservancy to buy the 320-acre oak meadow near Cornell and Wagon 
roads in Agoura.

L.A. REJECTS LIQUOR PERMIT FOR STORE NEAR CRIME-RIDDEN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council refused Tuesday to issue a liquor sales permit to 
a Canoga Park mini-mart owner who wanted to sell beer and wine near a park 
notorious for drug dealing and alcohol-related arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Alan Deal, commanding officer of the West Valley police division, told 
council members that the permit should be denied because the neighborhood near 
the mini-mall is experiencing skyrocketing crime rates, largely due to problems 
at Lanark Park, which he called "the worst park in the West Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Liquor already can be purchased at eleven businesses within 1,000 feet of the 
new gas station and mini-mart on the southeast corner of Topanga Canyon and 
Roscoe boulevards, said Councilwoman Joy Picus, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
About 48% of the arrests made at the park and in the surrounding neighborhood 
involve public drinking charges, Deal said. The excessive public drinking in 
the area exacerbates the drug problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1988, arrests jumped 52% from 455 to 696. Figures so far this 
year show 980 arrests have been made for crimes such as drug dealing, public 
drinking, assault and theft. 
</P>
<P>
"These are incredible statistics," Picus said. "We don't need another place 
selling liquor in an area that already has an over-concentration of them." 
</P>
<P>
Bishara K. Helo, who was seeking the liquor permit for his 24-hour mini-mart, 
did not appear before the council. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has the authority to deny the necessary zoning permits to 
liquor store applicants. The council unanimously rejected Helo's application. 
The decision was sent to Mayor Tom Bradley for approval.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: APPARENT VICTIM OF SEIZURE DIES IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aman who apparently suffered a seizure while driving died Tuesday when his van 
crashed into a tree in Thousand Oaks, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Reece James Vandergriff, 61, of Westlake Village was pronounced dead at 
Westlake Medical Center shortly after the 9:40 a.m. crash, Sgt. Herb Roper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vandergriff was driving south on Hampshire Road near Foothill Drive when he 
became incapacitated, Roper said. His van continued at about 20 m.p.h., 
traveling down a sidewalk for about 100 feet until it crashed into a tree at 
Hampshire and Townsgate roads. 
</P>
<P>
Roper said investigators examining Vandergriff's medical records determined 
that the man had a history of seizures. He said witnesses told deputies that 
the man appeared to be unconscious at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The type of seizure was unknown and will not be determined until an autopsy is 
performed later this week, Roper said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI RESIDENTS' SEWER BILLS TO INCREASE 60% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monthly sewer bills for Simi Valley residents will increase 60% starting next 
month, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, about 26,000 households will pay $9.56 per month for 
sewer hookups, up from the present rate of $5.94. The monthly rate may increase 
to about $12 by 1995, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Simi Valley City Council, who unanimously approved the increase 
Monday, said they were forced to raise rates under the conditions of a 
$7-million grant from the state and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The grant, given to the Simi Valley County Sanitation District in 1977, was 
used to expand the capacity of the city's waste treatment plant from 7.5 
million gallons per day to its present daily level of 9.1 million gallons. 
Construction was completed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the grant were that the costs of operating the sanitation district 
had to be passed on to customers, not paid for out of property tax revenues, 
said Michael Kleinbrodt, deputy public works director. However, the sanitation 
district has used property taxes for the past 10 years to help pay for the 
district's operating costs because it mistakenly believed that changes in 
federal laws were retroactive and applied to the 1977 grant, Kleinbrodt said. 
</P>
<P>
A routine audit of the grant last year revealed the problem, and city officials 
were told to either stop using property tax revenues or to repay the $7-million 
grant. The district is not required to repay the property tax revenues it used 
in past years, Kleinbrodt said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE POWER OUTAGE BLAMED ON WORK CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operator error was identified this week as the cause of a line failure that 
left the entire city of Glendale without electricity for more than an hour 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Freudenburg, spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
said Tuesday that an inquiry concluded that a mistake was made by a two-man 
crew testing one of the two lines that carry electricity to Glendale through 
the Air Way substation near San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
The precise nature of the mistake was still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Freudenburg said it had not been determined whether the error was due to a 
failure in communication, poor judgment or a deficiency in procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at what procedures they followed or did not follow and whether 
our procedures are correct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity purchased by Glendale from suppliers outside the area comes to the 
city over DWP lines. The connection is made by two 230,000-volt lines in the 
Air Way substation, either capable of carrying the entire load. 
</P>
<P>
Controls for the circuit-breaking equipment for the two lines are in one 
location, said Marcy Lopez, a system engineer. Lopez said the two workers had 
one line turned off for testing when they inadvertently opened a relay 
controlling the other line, which stopped the flow of electricity.

SCIOSCIA GETS BIG SLAM AS DODGERS CLOSE DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Scioscia's timing hasn't been too good lately, but nobody could fault him 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia's team reached a low point Monday with the word that Kirk Gibson, last 
year's league most valuable player, is lost for the season with a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia himself had nearly hit a low point Monday. Actually, he hadn't hit 
much at all. 
</P>
<P>
His average entering Tuesday's game against the Atlanta Braves was .240, the 
lowest it had been since April 22. 
</P>
<P>
But with one well-timed swing, he raised both his average and his team's 
spirits, hitting a grand slam off John Smoltz to lead the Dodgers to a 10-2 
victory before 30,713 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
That equaled the Dodger season high in runs, a mark reached twice. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Stubbs followed Scioscia's lead, later adding a three-run homer for 
the knockout punch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been struggling with the bat of late," Scioscia said. "That's why I'm 
hitting eighth. In that situation (the bases loaded), I'm just trying to hit 
the ball hard somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"But my job on this club is defense. That's my main contribution. I call about 
130 pitches and work with the defense. Not that offense isn't important. But I 
cannot let it affect my defense." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia had plenty to concentrate on behind the plate as well. Orel Hershiser 
(14-8) pitched a complete game, but this was not a vintage performance. He gave 
up two runs, seven hits, struck out two and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he struggled, but that's a tribute to the great pitcher he is that 
he hung in there," Scioscia said. 
</P>
<P>
He usually does against Atlanta. Hershiser has won eight consecutive and 10 of 
his last 11 decisions against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great, but not real strong," Hershiser said. "I didn't have my location 
all night." 
</P>
<P>
He'll get no sympathy from Smoltz, who is 11-10 after lasting four innings and 
surrendering five runs, five hits and four walks. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't get into a rhythm," said Smoltz, at 22 the National League's 
youngest pitcher. "I just didn't bear down enough. One swing, four runs. That's 
a big blow. I wasn't the same after that home run." 
</P>
<P>
Brave Manager Russ Nixon said: "We're dealing with a young man who had success 
early and is now in a downward trend. It happens to all young pitchers. It will 
make a better pitcher out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia had an opportunity to drive in more runs, but he made inning-ending 
outs twice in bases-loaded situations. 
</P>
<P>
"The second time I had a picture of hitting another one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Considering his recent lack of hitting success, he wasn't complaining too 
loudly. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia and the Dodgers had other things to worry about in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Smith, his 10-game hitting streak ended the night before, didn't wait 
long to start a new one. The third batter in the game, Smith put a Hershiser 
pitch over the right-center-field wall for his 17th home run. 
</P>
<P>
And then came Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray and Stubbs opened the Dodger second with singles, and Billy Bean 
was walked to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
That brought up Mike Huff and his perfect average. Huff, recalled from 
Albuquerque Sunday, singled as a pinch-hitter Monday in his major league debut. 
He almost got another hit his first time up Tuesday, dribbling a ball down the 
third-base line. Smoltz, however, bare-handed the ball and fired to the plate 
to force Murray. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing could save Smoltz from the 1-and-0 pitch he threw to Scioscia. The 
Dodger catcher deposited it in the bleacher seats in right-center, his fifth 
homer of the year and his second grand slam, the first coming June 4 against 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers added another run in the third when Smoltz's control deserted him. 
</P>
<P>
A single by Lenny Harris and two walks loaded the bases, and another walk to 
Huff forced in the run. 
</P>
<P>
That brought Scioscia to the plate with another bases-loaded situation. He hit 
a fly ball in the same direction as the first, but this one was caught by Dale 
Murphy far from the seats. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves scored in the fifth when Andre Thomas hit a double and came home on 
Jeff Blauser's single. 
</P>
<P>
But an inning later, the Dodgers renewed their onslaught against Sergio Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
After singles by Alfredo Griffin and Willie Randolph and a force play, Murray 
scored a run with a line single off the glove of first baseman Darrell Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs then hit a towering home run into the seats in left-center, his fourth 
home run of the year. 
</P>
<P>
This was Stubbs' seventh start in the last nine games, a role that seems to 
agree with him. Overall he is hitting .293. But in his 18 games as a starter, 
he is hitting .352. 
</P>
<P>
After Stubbs' home run, the Braves went down meekly as Hershiser held them to 
two hits the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers added a final run in the eighth, Murray getting his third hit, a 
single, to drive home Dave Anderson, who had doubled. 
</P>
<P>
As he did a year ago, Hershiser is starting to get hot in the latter stages of 
the season. He has won five of his last six starts to give him a good shot a 20 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
Timing. As Scioscia could tell you, it's all a matter of timing. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't an outing John Smoltz will care to remember, but he did take 
something from Tuesday's outing. By striking out three in his four innings, 
Smoltz takes over league leadership in that category with 142, one more than 
Dodger Tim Belcher. . . . There was a doubleheader of sorts Tuesday night with 
the Dodgers and Braves being preceded by the Dodgers against their wives and 
children in the annual family game. The wives and children won their 19th 
consecutive game, 18-0. Highlight was the inside-the-park, 
run-the-bases-backward, home run by 2-year-old Ryan Anderson, son of Dave. . . 
. The last Dodger before Mike Scioscia to hit two grand slams in one season was 
Mike Marshall in 1985. . . . Scioscia's grand slam was the Dodgers' fourth of 
the year. . . . The Dodgers close out their home stand tonight with John 
Wetteland (3-3) opposing Atlanta's Pete Smith (2-11).

PADRES SUMMON BENES AFTER ASTROS POUND ON SCHULZE

<P>
Third base was supposed to be a Padre problem. And a power hitter. As spring 
turned into summer, Manager Jack McKeon wanted another power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday evening in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, the Padres were forced 
to deal with a problem they didn't anticipate during those optimistic days of 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Don Schulze, obtained from the New York Yankees July 22 and thrust into the 
lineup to replace Walt Terrell, lasted four innings, allowing two home runs. 
Houston hit two more homers on this night, but by then, things were long since 
decided as the Padres lost to Houston, 12-3, in front of 16,988. 
</P>
<P>
And with a doubleheader Friday against Atlanta and the Padres currently eight 
games behind first-place San Francisco, the Padres made a move to solve their 
pitching woes after the game. They summoned Andy Benes, the nation's No. 1 pick 
in the June 1988 free agent draft, from Las Vegas (triple A). They also 
recalled right-hander Dan Murphy (6-9, 4.20 ERA at Las Vegas). 
</P>
<P>
To make room, they dispatched Fred Toliver (7.07 earned-run average) and Dave 
Leiper (5.02 ERA) to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Benes will start one of the games of Friday's doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw him in spring training, and he's got an arm," McKeon said. "We wanted 
to be patient with him, because he's big in our future. But now is the perfect 
opportunity. We need a pitcher for Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Benes was 2-1 at Las Vegas with an 8.10 ERA. He allowed 41 hits in 26 2/3 
innings. He started the season at Wichita (double A), where he was 
overpowering, going 8-4 with a 2.16 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris will make his final start on Thursday and then be sent back to the 
bullpen, where he has pitched well this season. McKeon said he may go with a 
four-man rotation for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
Five Padre pitchers served up four Houston home runs Tuesday. And what was 
almost as troubling was four Padre errors. 
</P>
<P>
None of which helped the depleted pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Two-fifths of the rotation that began the season for the Padres has 
disappeared. Terrell is in Yankee pinstripes and Eric Show was knocked out for 
the season by back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Into their places came Schulze and Harris. Schulze, 26, was 2-0 before 
Tuesday's debacle despite a soaring 4.09 earned-run average. He lasted six 
innings in his first start as a Padre, against the Dodgers, and five on Aug. 3 
against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, meanwhile, left a gaping hole in the Padre bullpen when he moved into 
the starting rotation. Basically, Mark Grant and Mark Davis are the only 
relievers McKeon has any confidence in. Before Tuesday, Toliver last appeared 
in a game on July 30. So did Leiper, who came in in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how much confidence McKeon had in Toliver: With Houston ahead, 6-0, in 
the fourth Tuesday and the game seemingly out of reach, Toliver got up to warm 
up in the bullpen. Then the Padres scored three runs to pull within reach. So 
Grant got up, and Toliver sat down. 
</P>
<P>
Toliver finally got in after Grant allowed four runs on three hits in two 
innings of work, running the score to 10-3. Toliver walked the first batter he 
faced, Gerald Young, then watched Craig Biggio drill a pitch over the 
right-field fence to make it 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Toliver, though, had a few things to say before he left. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a starter," he said. "You don't pitch this kind of arm every 13 days. I'm 
a competitor. I know how to win. I don't like sitting. You have to use me. I've 
got to try and not be (angry) and hold back the tears. I'm an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go to a rehab center. I don't do drugs. I'm a good guy. Somebody's 
going to give me the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Schulze (2-1) started things Tuesday by allowing a two-run home run to Glenn 
Davis in the first and a three-run homer to Davis in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Then Grant gave up a three-run homer to Ken Caminiti in the sixth. And Toliver 
served a two-run homer to Craig Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got out-homered, guys," McKeon said. "No question about that." 
</P>
<P>
Just three National League teams totaled fewer than Houston's 63 homers 
entering Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Houston starter Jim Clancy (6-9), meanwhile, was able to withstand a Padre 
rally in the fourth and ease to a win. It was his third victory over the Padres 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze started out smoothly, getting Houston's two leadoff Craigs, Biggio and 
Reynolds, to ground to shortstop. But then, trouble started on a ground ball to 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark backhanded it, but his flip to Schulze, who was covering first, was 
low and wide. Schulze couldn't get his 6-foot-3 frame down in time, and the 
ball bounded off his glove. Schulze was given the error, and the Astros were 
still alive in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Davis proved that by taking a one-and-one Schulze pitch over the left-center 
field fence for his 26th home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, it got worse before it got better for the Padres. In the second 
inning, Gerald Young reached first when Clark fielded his bleeder and then 
dropped it while trying to make the throw. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, with Doran on first, Davis hit a sharp grounder to shortstop 
Garry Templeton. The ball, as well as a potential double play, skipped between 
Templeton's legs. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Puhl followed with a single, scoring Doran and sending Davis to second. 
Here, the Padres -- and Schulze -- finally got a break. 
</P>
<P>
Caminiti hit your basic, routine single off the left-field wall. It easily 
would have been a double had the bases not been clogged with unsure Astros. 
Davis only advanced as far as third, thus halting the activity around the rest 
of the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze then struck out Billy Hatcher, and got Young to fly to left. Davis 
tagged up on the fly, but Carmelo Martinez threw a perfect one-hopper to 
catcher Benito Santiago, who made a sweeping tag in time to double up Davis. 
</P>
<P>
So Houston had three runs, none of them earned. 
</P>
<P>
That lasted until the fourth, when Schulze met Davis for the third time. With 
Clancy standing on second and Biggio on first, Davis hit another one-and-one 
pitch even farther into the left-center field bleachers than the first. It was 
6-0, Astros, and time was about out for Schulze and the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
But remember, Clancy was the man who started against the Cincinnati Reds last 
week when the Reds struck for 14 runs and 16 hits in the first inning of a game 
in Cincinnati. And in the Padre fourth, he reverted to that form. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton, Gwynn and Clark led off with singles, with Templeton scoring on 
Clark's hit. Then Chris James doubled to left, extending his hitting streak to 
a career-high 12 games and driving in Gwynn to make it 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez struck out looking at a full-count pitch before Mike Pagliarulo 
grounded to short, giving Clark time to cross the plate while James advanced to 
third. Santiago, though, flied to left to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Houston scored again in the sixth on a run-scoring Doran single and another 
three-run homer, this one by Caminiti. It came off Grant and made the score 
10-3. 
</P>
<P>
The final runs were scored in the seventh, when Biggio hit the two-run homer 
off Toliver. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scott, the winningest pitcher in the major leagues with a 17-6 record, is 
doubtful for Thursday's scheduled start for the Astros against the Padres. 
Scott reinjured his left hamstring warming up in the bullpen before Saturday's 
7-0 loss at San Francisco. "It will be a miracle if he pitches," Manager Art 
Howe said. . . Entering Tuesday's game, Houston outfielders had hit just six 
home runs in 1,250 at-bats. Padre backup catcher Mark Parent has six homers in 
117 at bats. . . . The Giants' announcement that pitcher Dave Dravecky, 
recovering from surgery to remove a malignant tumor from his left arm, will 
start Thursday impressed McKeon. "If there's a guy who could do it, he'd be the 
guy," McKeon said. "He has so much faith in himself, and he has a tremendous 
positive attitude. And, he worked like hell to get to this point. He's a real 
special guy. Just going out there is enough -- for him to throw that first 
pitch will be quite an accomplishment." . . . Sandy Alomar Jr. went four for 
five Monday night for triple-A Las Vegas to extend his hitting streak to 18 
games. Alomar, who is batting .479 (35 for 73) during the streak, raised his 
season average to .307. He has 90 runs batted in.

BILL MCCOLL CREDITS HALAS FOR OPPORTUNITY TO MIX CAREER IN MEDICINE WITH 
FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As successful as Bill McColl has been as an orthopedic surgeon, his 
professional life wouldn't have been complete without a big assist from the 
legendary George Halas. 
</P>
<P>
When McColl graduated from Hoover High School in 1948 and headed for Stanford, 
he already had a master plan for his venture into the real world. Assuming that 
all went well in college, he would play pro football, then go into medicine. 
</P>
<P>
McColl's four years at Stanford fit in perfectly with his two goals. He 
epitomized the term student-athlete, becoming a two-time unanimous All-American 
end and gaining admission to medical school after his junior year. His athletic 
feats eventually got him elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was the matter of combining football with further medical studies, 
and that was where Halas came in. Of all the men of influence in the National 
Football League, only the late founder and coach of the Chicago Bears agreed to 
make it possible for McColl to pursue both careers. 
</P>
<P>
Halas had done the same for several other Bear players who aspired to be 
doctors or dentists. Among them was guard Dan Fortmann, a member of the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame who served for many years as team physician of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
So when the NFL draft approached in 1952, only Halas and the Bears saw fit to 
use a high choice on McColl. They waited at that, selecting in the third round 
a player who under normal circumstances would have been a first-rounder. At 6-4 
and 230 pounds, McColl was a natural for the newly evolving position of tight 
end. 
</P>
<P>
McColl, 59, looked back 37 years as he sat next to the pool at his La Jolla 
home, which is on a bluff overlooking Tourmaline Surfing Park. He has offices 
in San Diego and Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I got drafted so late is a story in itself," McColl said. "It 
was pretty clear that it was because I was in med school. I told all the pros 
that I wouldn't play unless I was allowed to continue in med school. 
</P>
<P>
"Most coaches have less creative minds regarding football. George Halas was one 
of the more creative people in the league. If he saw a player he wanted, he 
would do what he had to do to get that player." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Halas was kind enough -- and smart enough -- to let McColl lead a 
double life, McColl didn't join the Bears until he was granted one big extra 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
"I insisted that if there was ever a conflict, medicine would take precedence 
over football," McColl said. "Halas promised, and while I occasionally had to 
remind him of it, he never went back on his promise. 
</P>
<P>
"I enrolled in med school at the University of Chicago, and my first year with 
the Bears, all my classes were in the afternoon. He arranged to practice in the 
morning, so I didn't miss many practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I would miss meetings at night because I had to study, but those 
meetings were held basically to keep the players busy so they wouldn't go out 
on the town." 
</P>
<P>
McColl played eight seasons with the Bears before retiring at age 29. He caught 
201 passes and scored 25 touchdowns, reaching career highs of 36 receptions in 
1953 and eight touchdowns in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Son Milt, who will turn 30 on Aug. 28, is a virtual clone of his father. Milt 
also starred in football at Stanford, also played eight seasons in the NFL -- 
seven with the San Francisco 49ers and one with the Raiders -- and also is a 
doctor specializing in orthopedics. He is near the end of his internship in San 
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Milt's pro football career did differ from his father's in two respects. He was 
a linebacker, and he made it in the NFL despite having been ignored in the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
All six children of Bill McColl and his wife, Barbara, graduated from Stanford, 
and four have master's degrees. The two other boys also were athletes, Duncan 
in football and John in volleyball. Duncan, a defensive end, was a fourth-round 
draft choice of the Washington Redskins in 1977, but was cut after a season on 
injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Of his relatively early retirement, the senior McColl said, "I would have liked 
to play the 1960 season, but I was at a critical point in my medical training. 
I was in my orthopedic residency, and certain professors thought I should have 
continuity instead of taking time off to play football. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still at the peak of my career, and I was healthy and wanted to play. 
Halas wanted me to play, too, but I realized it was a good time to get out." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, a rookie named Mike Ditka came along. As McColl put it, "I don't 
think the Bears missed me at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, now the Bears coach, is the only former tight end in the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
McColl was asked what was it like to play for Halas. 
</P>
<P>
"He always let you know who was boss," McColl said. "But he was a fine guy, a 
fine, loyal gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask me this all the time, and many years ago, I put down my feelings 
about George Halas in a letter I wrote to him when he was being honored as 
Chicagoan of the year." 
</P>
<P>
McColl went inside for a few minutes and returned with a five-page letter, 
dated Jan. 20, 1976. In it, he told Halas how much their association had meant 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
One passage in the letter brought to mind Ditka's oft-repeated remark that 
Halas "threw nickels around like manhole covers." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a time when Halas offered him a raise because he was interning and 
had just become a father, McColl wrote, "I concluded from these contract 
negotiations that, one, George Halas would never pay a ballplayer a nickel more 
than he felt he was worth, but that, two, there was no limit to his generosity 
or his willingness to go the extra mile when the personal lives of his 
ballplayers were concerned." 
</P>
<P>
McColl noted that Halas had even played good Samaritan to players who had 
openly criticized him. He cited these examples: Halas had loaned wide receiver 
Harlon Hill $15,000 to buy a chicken farm and had picked up a $5,000 hospital 
bill for the wife of defensive tackle Bill Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
In summing up, McColl wrote, "If I were thrown into jail in any part of the 
world including Mexico or Turkey, and could make only one telephone call -- the 
U.S. Consulate, my attorney or my father -- I would call George Halas, because 
I know that not only does he have the contacts to help; he would go to hell if 
necessary to help one of his former players." 
</P>
<P>
McColl never was an All-Pro, although many people thought he should have been, 
but he was a consistent producer and never missed a game. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my one injury," he said, holding up a bent right little finger. "I 
caught a pass wrong in practice from Tommy O'Connell. It's a chronic sprain, 
but it's an effective thing because when patients show me their fingers, I tell 
them it's not how a finger looks but how it works." 
</P>
<P>
The term "tight end" had just become part of football nomenclature when McColl 
joined the Bears. He didn't invent the position, but he was one of the first to 
play it. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '50s, some teams, notably the Rams and Bears, began using a third 
end instead of a third running back. 
</P>
<P>
"Clark Shaughnessy split the Rams' two ends," McColl said. "They had Elroy 
Hirsch and Tom Fears. That opened up the passing game, and the formation came 
to be known as the pro set. 
</P>
<P>
"Later, when I was a rookie, Shaughnessy was on the Bears' staff. I started out 
a yard behind the line of scrimmage (as a slot back), but he moved me up to the 
line. That gave me an extra yard to get away from the linebacker. The position 
didn't change at all, but it made it tougher on the linebacker and made for a 
more powerful running game." 
</P>
<P>
Many tight ends will say they get a bigger kick out of blocking than receiving, 
but McColl was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I liked receiving better," he said. "I played wide a lot, too. At 
Stanford, I was an end who could split and also do a lot of blocking. I caught 
42 passes one year. I could go deep, but I wasn't much of a threat to run after 
I caught the ball." 
</P>
<P>
McColl's talents were not confined to the basic duties of a tight end. He had 
such a strong arm that he threw one touchdown pass of 79 yards and another of 
59, both to speedy Harlon Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The 79-yarder, on which Hill made a juggling, lunging catch in the end zone, 
helped give the Bears a 17-17 tie with the New York Giants en route to the 
Western Division title in 1956. The Giants then routed the Bears in the 
championship game, 47-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I could throw a ball 75 or 80 yards," McColl said. "On the 79-yarder, I ran an 
end-around play toward left end. Then I came back and planted my feet and threw 
a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as I released the ball, I got splattered. I jumped up and yelled to the 
referee, 'Roughing the passer. Roughing the passer.' Then I looked up and 
everybody was yelling 'Touchdown.' 
</P>
<P>
"Years later, Rosey Grier admitted he was the one who creamed me." 
</P>
<P>
The title game was played on a frozen field at Yankee Stadium in New York, and 
the consensus at the time was that the Giants had chosen their footwear more 
wisely than the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"The sportswriters seemed to think that was the case," McColl said. "I would 
just say the Giants were on and we were off. I think it was a matter of 
biorhythms. It was our only title shot during my career (the Bears finished 
second four times), so it was a big disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
The quarterbacks who threw passes to McColl during most of that period were Ed 
Brown, Zeke Bratkowski and Hall of Famer George Blanda. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite was Blanda," McColl said. "He would throw short, soft passes on 
anticipation. I'd look up and the ball was right in there. 
</P>
<P>
"On third and 10, Brown would go to Hill on a deep out. Blanda would go to me 
over the middle for a first down. One time against Baltimore, Blanda threw 
seven passes to me in the fourth quarter, two of them for touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
Before settling into orthopedic practice in 1965 -- he started in Covina -- 
McColl packed up his family in 1962 and went as medical missionary to South 
Korea, where he became a pioneer in reconstructive surgery on leprosy patients. 
He produced, directed and narrated a film, "Highway of Hope," on the 
rehabilitation of victims of leprosy. Today, he is board chairman of American 
Leprosy Missions Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, McColl was named one of the nation's 10 outstanding young men by the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. From 1976 to 1980, he was a member of Stanford's 
board of trustees, and he is now vice president of San Diego's Hall of 
Champions. 
</P>
<P>
There have been setbacks. McColl tried and failed three times to win a seat in 
the U.S. House of Representatives, the last in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But everything else seemingly has gone right, and it all began when McColl was 
at Hoover High. He made the All-CIF teams in football, basketball and baseball 
and excelled in the high and low hurdles in track. 
</P>
<P>
"My big rival center in basketball was Don Larsen of Point Loma," McColl said, 
referring to the man who in 1956 pitched a perfect game for the New York 
Yankees in the World Series. "He was named the star of the month in January of 
'47, and I was named in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I beat Larsen once in American Legion baseball. I think I threw a no-hitter. I 
threw fast and wild, so I scared the hitters, but I was just lucky that day. My 
baseball coach, Les Cassie, wanted me to go to a Dodger tryout camp, but I 
never followed it up." 
</P>
<P>
McColl liked football too much to give baseball a try, and thanks to Halas, he 
had the best of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"The pay in pro football wasn't great, but it was sufficient," McColl said. "It 
permitted me to go to med school, get married, have a family and become a 
missionary and still have a down payment on a house. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have had a much tougher time if George Halas hadn't let me mix 
medicine with football."

FISH REPORT: AT LAKE HAVASU, ANGLERS MAKE BIG RUN ON STRIPED BASS WITH NEW LURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anglers looking for action with striped bass have found it at Lake Havasu the 
past few days. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean a lot of it through the whole lake," operator Bob Lee reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Sam Perry of Corona caught and released more than 60 stripers in a 
four-hour frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest lure is one of the new Wiglstiks. 
</P>
<P>
WILLOW BEACH -- Fishing good from shore, with anchovies. Vern Wade had an 
18-pound striper near hatchery, offshore, and Craig Honey a 24-pounder by 
hatchery on an anchovy. Marvin Height of Las Vegas, took a 19 1/2-pound striper 
trolling downriver with a Long A Bomber. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Most activity from striped bass on anchovies, 25 to 50 feet deep, 
with a few topwater boils in Vegas Wash and in Overton Arm at Stewart's Point. 
A few catfish are in coves at night but running under 2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Lots of topwater action with stripers. Still generally small but 
individual catches reported from 3-10 pounds. "Wiglstik" lures successful, 
along with surface and sub-surface lures and chuggers. Catfish and largemouth 
slow, probably because water relatively cool. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass continuing strong. John Bonner of Bullhead City, 
Ariz., caught 27-pounder in Ft. Mojave area, using an anchovy. Lots of nice 
trout from casinos to Laughlin Bridge. Powerbait best. Catfish running at 3 
pounds in good numbers, using waterdogs up on the lake. Tuesday's temperature 
was 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Catch improving on croakers, using frozen anchovies. Catfish 
slow. One corvina weighed 14 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout good, trolling needlefish to seven colors down center at 
west end. Largemouth bass slow. Catfish good on mackerel in shallow areas. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Catfish and trout very good. Lots of catfish limits taken on 
mackerel in 3 to 5 feet along weed line. George Collier, Oxnard, had 10-fish 
limit totaling 60 pounds, the largest 18. Trolling with needlefish by dam in 
50-60 feet producing lots of trout. Largemouth bass first thing in morning 
only, although some seen on surface. Perch and crappie very slow. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Catfish still good, averaging about 7 pounds on mackerel, 10-35 
feet deep. Largemouth bass have turned erratic with the weather. Easy to get 
but small -- 1-3 pounds. No large stripers. Trout planted at both ends of lake 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- All fishing slow, despite catch of a 9-pound catfish. Trout and 
largemouth bass all small, with only a few limits. Night crawlers working best. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE ISABELLA -- Nightfishing from shore good for catfish, with clams, mackerel 
and night crawlers. Some largemouth bass from boats and float tubes. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO LAKES -- Been slow and getting slower. For example, 359 anglers 
checked at Otay had 54 bass, 24 sunfish, 2 crappie and 70 channel cats. Bob 
Ulery of La Mesa caught catfish weighing 18-4 and 15-12 at San Vicente. Launch 
ramp at Miramar closed. Water also dropping at Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Renee Attaway of Fountain Valley caught a 39-pound catfish at 
night, using a mackerel. Crappie excellent at night, with bullet jigs and 
yellow chartreuse. Best from boats, but also good from shore and around boat 
docks, at Sierra Cove and red clay cliffs. A few bass on plastics at Rocky 
Point and west shore. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SKINNER -- Good for catfish, with mackerel and night crawlers. Some 
bluegill and crappie. Bass are 30 feet down for experienced anglers. 
Traditional baits are getting some trout from 60 feet down by dam. 
</P>
<P>
BIG BEAR LAKE -- Some thunderstorms and rain this week, but fishing good. Trout 
being taken from shore from Windy Point west to dam, using Powerbait. Trollers 
doing well with flashers, crawlers and needlefish, collecting catches 12-14 
inches. Catfish running 3-5 pounds on chicken livers and mackerel. Largemouth 
bass good only in early morning and late afternoon on plastic worms, grubs and 
spinner baits, at east end around weed beds and bays on south side. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SILVERWOOD -- Many nice stripers, topped by Greg Silks of Alta Loma, 22 
pounds, on a Bomber; Steve Mahoney of Barstow, 25, on Bomber 17-J, and Warren 
Dalfosse of Santa Monica, 20, on Stalker lure, all in channel. Many 13-17s. One

CAL LUTHERAN TO REPLACE SHOUP AS COACH; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS THAT '89 WILL BE HIS LAST SEASON STUNS KINGMEN'S FOOTBALL PATRIARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran University, a school that has known only one coach in 27 years of 
football, will begin a search for its second later this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Shoup will be permanently replaced as coach at the conclusion of the 
upcoming season, Bob Doering, CLU's athletic director, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup, 57, had been granted a one-year sabbatical for the 1990-91 school year 
but was under the impression that he would return to both his faculty and 
coaching positions the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Doering said that Shoup would retain his "regular teaching responsibilities" 
but would not be the head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
All of which was news to Shoup, who was reached by telephone Tuesday afternoon 
at his home in Thousand Oaks. "If that is true, it's a surprise to me," Shoup 
said. "We met this morning and I specifically outlined things to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup said the that idea of his retiring as coach was discussed in a meeting 
with Doering and two other CLU officials. "They suggested it as a possibility," 
Shoup said, "and I said no." 
</P>
<P>
Doering declined comment on why Shoup will be relieved of his coaching duties, 
deferring to a school statement that is scheduled for release to the media on 
Thursday. Cal Lutheran will conduct a national search for Shoup's replacement, 
Doering said, and hopes to have a new coach by January. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup started the Cal Lutheran football program in 1962 with a $5,000 budget, 
borrowed equipment, a Navy bus rescued from a war-surplus store, and a field 
cut out of an orange grove. Nine years later, the Kingsmen won a National Assn. 
of Intercollegiate Athletics championship and in the process gave the 
financially strapped school such a public-relations boost that it was saved 
from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup is also credited with playing a major role in convincing the Dallas 
Cowboys to use CLU as a summer training camp facility. The alliance with the 
NFL team has resulted in field, locker room and weight training facilities that 
were paid for by the Cowboys and later used by the Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of longevity, Shoup is fourth among active college coaches in years of 
service. Only Grambling's Eddie Robinson, Minnesota-Duluth's Jim Malosky and 
Ashland College's Fred Martinelli have coached longer. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of success, Shoup's record of 182-81-6 is also among the best in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question he has a very successful won and loss record and he has 
built a fine football reputation at CLU," Doering said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Shoup's guidance, Cal Lutheran won 13 NAIA District 3 titles and played 
in three national championship games before joining the NCAA Division II 
Western Football Conference in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the Kingsmen have fallen on hard times. In the past four 
seasons, CLU is 16-27 overall and has won only two of 21 conference games. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen won their first two games in 1988 then lost eight in a row, 
prompting the school to withdraw from the WFC at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will join the non-scholarship Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference, which is affiliated with the NCAA Division III, as soon as 
its scholarship athletes complete their eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup, who preferred to add rather than subtract scholarships, was publicly 
critical of CLU's decision to join the SCIAC. He would have preferred a return 
to the NAIA as an independent without conference affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
The year's leave, Shoup believed, would be a time to travel, do some 
consulting, and study his options as he entered the twilight of his coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly at the stage in my professional career where it's best to keep 
my options open," Shoup said Tuesday morning, before a reporter informed him of 
the school's decision. "As of now, I'm not ruling anything out. This will give 
me time to evaluate my situation, something I wouldn't normally be able to do 
while recruiting and fund-raising and doing all the things that need to be done 
for the football program."

PIERCE EXPECTED TO HIRE 2 COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pierce College has called a press conference for Thursday at 1 p.m., apparently 
to introduce two new physical education teachers who also will coach at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
An academic committee last week recommended Bob Lofrano, Chatsworth High's 
baseball coach, and Bill Norton, an assistant football coach who had been hired 
as a walk-on, for the positions. That committee has not reconvened since making 
its recommendations to Pierce President Dan Means.

WEST BONES UP ON HITTING IN MYSTIC MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
YOUNTVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometime about 11 p.m. on a dark and quiet Sunday here, the Woodland Hills West 
American Legion baseball team gathered in a circle on Borman Field. 
</P>
<P>
If you find that strange, you don't know the half of it. 
</P>
<P>
It's what they were doing that was really strange. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting the hex off of our bats," explained first baseman Ryan 
McGuire, who called the impromptu meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But just settling for that explanation wouldn't be right either. The complete 
story goes something like this: 
</P>
<P>
After two games in the state tournament here, Woodland Hills had scraped 
together just nine runs in 18 innings -- well below average for the 
heavy-hitting team. McGuire figured something drastic had to be done to the 
bats if the team was to come up with two big wins on Monday against San Leandro 
and Napa. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down to the restaurant in town," McGuire said, "and asked them if they 
had a spare steak bone lying around, for my dog, I said, and they said no. So I 
asked them for a chicken bone, or anything and they said they didn't have 
anything. So, I went to the store and bought a (plastic) doggie bone." 
</P>
<P>
Still baffled? Catcher Bobby Kim was, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone said that Ryan wanted to have a meeting outside," Kim said. "We didn't 
know why." 
</P>
<P>
Once outside and all alone on the empty field, the players gathered in a circle 
and held hands, with their bats on the ground. McGuire went around the circle 
with the store-bought doggie bone and rubbed each bat. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy was reminiscent of a scene in the motion picture "Bull Durham," in 
which one player rubbed a cross made of chicken bones to get the hex off of his 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as McGuire rubbed the bats, the scene grew stranger when Kim 
suddenly burst into a Korean prayer to further rid the team of the evil hitting 
spirits. When Kim finished, Jeff Marks followed with a similarly unexpected 
Jewish prayer, with the same intentions. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, the players held hands and stared at the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a cult out there," Ricky Banuelos said. 
</P>
<P>
Before dismissing this incident in the boys-will-be-boys file, consider the 
words of outfielder Jason Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked," Cohen insisted. "It really worked." 
</P>
<P>
A check of the numbers: In the three games after the ritual, Woodland Hills 
compiled 40 runs, 47 hits and five home runs, including two grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the bone, which hung faithfully on a rope in the Woodland 
Hills dugout, will be making the trip to Idaho.

SOCKERS OPEN OCT. 28; ALL-STAR GAME HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The defending champion Sockers will play at Dallas on Oct. 28 to open the 
1989-90 Major Indoor Soccer League season and then play Kansas City Nov. 3 in 
their home opener at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule, released by the MISL Tuesday, includes a bonus: The MISL All-Star 
game will be played at the Sports Arena Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of the St. Louis Storm and Cleveland Crunch, the MISL also 
split the league back into two divisions after a year without them. The Western 
Division includes the Sockers, Storm, Dallas Sidekicks and Tacoma Stars, and 
Eastern Division the Crunch, Baltimore Blast, Kansas City Comets and Wichita 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' schedule includes four more games (52) than last season. All but 
four of their 26 home dates will be Friday, Saturday or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The team also will play 13 pairs of games on consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
The MISL playoffs will include the top three teams from each division, with the 
division champion receiving a first-round bye. The No. 2 and 3 teams in each 
division will play a best-of-five series (two games at one site, two at the 
other, returning to the first site for the final game, if necessary). The 
winners will then play the division champions in a seven-game, two-three-two 
series, to be followed by another series with the same format for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers also formally announced the signing of Waad Hirmez, the ninth 
player to sign for the 1989-90 season. Hirmez, who started last season with the 
Los Angeles Lazers, has a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez, who played at Point Loma High School, returned to the Sockers last 
season in a trade that sent Poli Garcia to Los Angeles. Hirmez scored 26 goals 
and added 18 assists in 46 games last season.

<P>
'ABYSS': A WATERED-DOWN CLOSE ENCOUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Abyss" (throughout San Diego County) is the most hardware-cluttered movie 
imaginable, full of dials and valves and pressure locks and daunting technical 
gear, yet it leaves you feeling sappily euphoric. This must be like rapture of 
the deep: Machines crash against other machines underwater with a slo-mo bounce 
and a bell-like clanggggg; the ocean begins to collect as many floating spare 
parts as space and we look at it all benignly, "Thasssss nice." All stress 
washes away in this intense, mindless blueness; it's like 2 hours and 20 
minutes in an immersion tank full of Scope. 
</P>
<P>
With all its numskullness, "The Abyss" is at heart a sweet movie, full of 
people dying and then living for love, and nothing new to add on the subject of 
other-worldlings than "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" offered 12 years 
ago: "Give 'em a chance. You don't hurt them; they don't hurt you. Who knows, 
we might learn something from them." 
</P>
<P>
But the climax of "Close Encounters" was breathtaking and the climax of "The 
Abyss" is downright embarrassing; in the light of day, its payoff effect looks 
like a glazed ceramic what's-it your 11-year-old made in crafts class. It's 
criminal, because the undersea effects are glowingly beautiful and one gimmick 
used by the "non-terrestrial intelligence" (jargon theirs) is jaw-dropping. 
Perhaps, to keep us in its spell, this final effect should have surfaced at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
It's not at all hard to believe that writer-director James Cameron has carried 
this film in his head since he was 17; it's a 17-year-old's vision, complete 
with men who say "Steady, big fella" to each other without a trace of irony. In 
the meantime, however, Cameron and his producer and former co-writer, Gale Anne 
Hurd, have learned to make movies like "The Terminator" and "Aliens" that move 
with a headlong, punishing pace. So here we are, taking turns between 
free-floating and being propelled forward with a whoosh. And all in the service 
of a truly footling script. 
</P>
<P>
In brief, Cameron strands a nuclear submarine, armed with a 
bomb-to-end-all-bombs, on a shelf in the Caribbean. Two teams are involved in a 
rescue against the clock to get the dee-vice: the (mostly) hairy, brawny, 
wisecracking crew of Deepcore, a "submersible hyperbaric drilling platform" 
lodged at sea bottom -- the gang we may think of as us. And there are the 
militaristic crew-cut Navy SEAL (Sea, Air and Land) commandos, who are 
definitely them. Threatening them all is a malady called High-Pressure Nervous 
Syndrome, a sort of underwater PMS, which causes irrationality and galloping 
Oliver Northism. There's also a hurricane battering the Navy forces topside. 
And that bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Now you add the personalities. Returning to Deepcore during this crisis is 
Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), who seems to revel in her 
widespread reputation as "a cast-iron bitch." She has designed every inch of 
the steel monster and goes through it turning wheels and tapping valves like 
someone tidying up her kitchen after others have been messing in it. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman of Deepcore is Bud Brigman (Ed Harris), her estranged husband, 
seemingly thrilled about the split. Head of the loyal SEAL opposition is Lt. 
Coffey (Michael Biehn), whose eyes begin rolling like marbles within minutes of 
arriving at Deepcore's niche on the ocean floor. Before long, he is carving 
hash marks on his forearm with his assault knife. Not hard to tell where the 
dreaded nervous syndrome has struck this time. 
</P>
<P>
Most prominent of the crew members are Catfish (Leo Burmester), Harris' huge, 
ginger-bearded decompression expert, company for his scarier swims; the 
paranoid Hippy (Todd Graff), who has a pet white rat, and a roughneck, 
no-nonsense underwater tractor pilot, One Night (Kimberly Scott). If your heart 
sinks at names like this, it has every reason to. Not a single surprise of 
dialogue or character awaits you. 
</P>
<P>
As these men and women take to the depths in crab-like pods with pincer claws, 
or in extended-time diving helmets, or immersed in a liquid that lets Ed Harris 
"breathe fluid instead of air," we await the appearance of The Other. Imagine 
the surprise of discovering that it's a neon flittering Tinker Bell that leaves 
mortals all the better for encounters with its presence. 
</P>
<P>
There are more: rounded glowing transparent creatures in sea shapes. Most 
mysterious of all these visions is something like a mercury-glass pseudopod, a 
probe with a worm-like shape that can assume any shape and moves with the 
liquidity of water. This is the movie's payload, and in this blue, watery 
womb-like state it's tempting to float free and just enjoy it and the picture's 
frail message about the power of love. If only Cameron knew what to do with his 
other-worldlings; an explanation of their world, even a use for them except as 
a nifty, power-assisted forklift. So his picture simply dribbles away. 
</P>
<P>
In the matter of hardware (and excepting its final effect) "The Abyss" is 
flawless in each technical department; unfortunately, they can't all be 
credited here. Cinematographer Mikael Salomon's camera seems to race down steel 
corridors, only milliseconds in front of walls of water, and it seems to have 
been his formidable job to light up this Stygian universe. The business of 
non-gurgling voices at every depth would seem to be a horrendous task, 
conquered by sound mixer Lee Orloff. The veteran Leslie Dilley's production 
designs are both realistic and properly otherworldly. 
</P>
<P>
But apart from its technical gee-whizzery, "The Abyss" has more than its share 
of eyebrow-raisers. As Harris looks unconvinced about taking liquid 
fluorocarbon into his lungs in place of air, a wiser source says soothingly, 
"We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud. Your body will remember." That may 
be news to many of us ex-babies. 
</P>
<P>
Forget "Quest for Fire," where the half-naked cast huddled under pelts that 
must have smelled like wet Airedales. "The Abyss's" permanently drenched crew 
wins the Most Pathetic vote in a dog-paddle, including the estimable 
Mastrantonio, who must willingly drown herself in another plot-line 
mind-boggler. She and the ice-blue-eyed Harris do manage to bring fire to all 
this damp tinder, but it can't have been easy. 
</P>
<P>
It's perfectly possible to have a mindlessly pleasant time in the intense 
Tidy-Bowl blueness of "The Abyss." You just relax and let go. You may just 
wonder when you come out if you haven't pruned a little.

SPADER BREAKS OUT OF THE MOLD WITH 'SEX, LIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My agent called me up and said, 'I have a script here that is scaring a lot of 
people off.' I said, 'Well, sounds perfect" 
</P>
<P>
"sex, lies and videotape" indeed proved to have a perfect role for James 
Spader, winning him the best-actor award at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival after 
a string of smarmy supporting parts. 
</P>
<P>
In a review of the film, Newsweek said: "Who knew that Spader, formerly 
typecast as an arrogant yuppie brat, has such quiet, insinuating charisma?" The 
New York Times wrote that he plays his part "with a hesitant half-smile and 
tentative voice that makes him sweet and sinister at once, keeping everyone 
off-balance." 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Spader, an introspective, nomadic sort, is not far removed from 
Graham, his mysterious character in the darkly funny psychological drama, which 
opens in San Diego County on Friday. In his search for himself, Graham lives 
mostly out of the trunk of his car. He resists renting an apartment because he 
wants only one key in his life -- the key to his automobile. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy who thinks he knows himself very, very well," Spader said of 
Graham. "Just when you think you know yourself, you find out you don't know who 
you are at all. That's true in my own life." 
</P>
<P>
In the $1.2-million film, the first effort of 26-year-old writer-director 
Steven Soderbergh, Graham's propensity for life on the road is among the least 
of his unusual traits. As a professed pathological liar and impotent lover, 
Graham's only sexual satisfaction comes from videotaping women discussing their 
sexual fantasies for his later viewing pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play the character for the same reason people seem to respond to 
the film," said Spader, seated on the porch of his secluded Hollywood Hills 
home. Wearing jeans and a tie-dyed T-shirt, he resembled a '60s version of 
James Dean -- if Dean drank Evian water. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie is all about issues and emotions and humor that we all live with. 
And when you read that in a piece of material, you recognize it instantly as 
something that's profoundly private and intimate. The opportunity to break that 
out of your life and play with it out in the open is," he paused, "compelling." 
</P>
<P>
Another similarity between himself and Graham: "I like women more than men. I'm 
more comfortable around women than men. That's probably because of environment. 
I have two older sisters -- no brothers. I've lived with women all my life. And 
I never cease to be amazed, and surprised, and humored, and stimulated, by the 
women in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Spader said movie audiences traditionally have no problem identifying his 
character on the screen. He has spent much of his career in roles that call for 
him to preen and sneer down at theater audiences with the smugness of a 
self-satisfied brat. 
</P>
<P>
"I play a lot of rich bad guys," Spader said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
His resume for America's Most Unwanted Yuppie includes "Pretty in Pink," in 
which he tried to cajole best-buddy Andrew McCarthy from falling for the 
unpopular Molly Ringwald. In "Baby Boom," he played the sidewinding 
overachiever after Diane Keaton's job. He was a drug-dealing parasite in "Less 
Than Zero." And in "Wall Street," Spader played a lawyer who gave in to the 
temptation of insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole bunch of movies I had done came out all at once, and I was doing a lot 
of publicity for them," he said. "Different interviewers kept asking me if I 
was worried about getting typecast, and I realized I wasn't worried about 
getting typecast until I started doing publicity. There's a real need out there 
to try to pigeonhole actors. I think people are frustrated. People don't like 
to be confused." 
</P>
<P>
Spader was raised on the campus of a New England prep school where his father 
was an English teacher. He never went to college -- instead, when he was 17, he 
moved to New York. There, he worked at a warehouse unloading railroad cars, at 
a meatpacking plant as a truck driver, at a riding academy as a stable boy and 
as a foot messenger in the city. In his spare time, he acted. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just playing it week to week, really. The next thing I knew weeks (had) 
turned into years and I was still doing odd jobs and acting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spader's big movie debut was listed in the credits of a soft-core sex flick as 
Drunk Guy. From there, he became Brooke Shields' older brother in the 1981 film 
"Endless Love." After his steady diet of successful supporting parts, Spader 
was fed a feature role as twins in last year's mystery thriller "Jack's Back." 
Despite positive reviews, the film received only regional release and went 
immediately to video. Then came "sex, lies and videotape." 
</P>
<P>
In the weeklong rehearsals conducted by Soderbergh, Spader stretched and 
defined the character of Graham -- especially for the end of the film, where 
Graham discovers himself and in doing so, uncovers the lies his fellow 
characters are living. Spader said that Soderbergh derived the title of the 
film by asking himself what Graham would say if asked what the film was about. 
</P>
<P>
"I would venture to say that if Graham was asked before the end of the film 
what it was about, he might say, 'sex, lies and videotape.' But at the end I 
think he would say, 'I really don't have a clue.' Sex and lies -- videotape is 
a tool, that's it -- sex and lies have complexities that are so vast they can't 
be simplified. I hope that people are intrigued enough and curious enough about 
who Graham is and what the film is about to try and figure them out." 
</P>
<P>
Spader plays an upwardly mobile young executive in the suspense-thriller "Bad 
Influence," now shooting in the Los Angeles area. The recent publicity 
surrounding his co-star, Rob Lowe, has shown the reserved Spader a side of 
Hollywood that he doesn't care for. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot of real ugliness in this business," said Spader. "I just 
make a real attempt to not let that touch my life too much." 
</P>
<P>
Spader tries to put as much distance as possible between himself and his 
burgeoning career whenever he can. He has been known to hop in his car and 
spend months at a time driving across the United States. He used to tool around 
the country in a 1969 Porsche 911 convertible, until he married recently and -- 
with a baby on the way -- traded his sporty, easy rider for a "more domestic 
car." 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest thing about acting is that it's free-lance," he said. "Free-lance 
gives you a choice that is so dear, so very dear to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to make my own choices in life. When the job I'm working on now is 
done, I can do whatever it is I want to do for the rest of my life to earn my 
living. Anything."

"Well, so much for the critics," NBC News president Michael Gartner scoffs in a 
staff memo noting the ratings success of "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," which 
critics roasted because of its news re-creations. "The viewers viewed -- in big 
numbers," the news chief crows in his communique. He said "YTT" won its time 
slot with a 12 rating and 23% audience share and held "its audience throughout 
the hour" for its debut last Wednesday at 10 p.m. He also noted that the debut 
of ABC's far more publicized "PrimeTime Live" last Thursday "had lesser numbers 
and was third in its time period." Two more editions of "YTT" will air on Aug. 
23 and Sept. 13, after which NBC will decide if the program will go as a 
series. ALEENE MacMINN

S.D.'S CONTRIBUTION TO HIP TOLD NOT TO TOY WITH NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the hottest, hippest and most happening events on any self-respecting 
San Diego pop music fan's social calendar is the occasional surfacing of 
Playskool, a nomadic underground "nightclub" whose only permanent home is in 
the mind of its proprietor, 24-year-old Todd Zweig. 
</P>
<P>
The focus is on dancing -- to the latest Euro-pop, roots rock and heavy metal 
records, spun by deejays who consider the Top 40 more of a junkyard than a 
happy hunting ground. Adding to the fun is an eclectic assortment of 
entertaining asides, such as fashion shows, go-go and belly dancers, mimes, 
female impersonators, performance artists and screenings of campy cult films 
and videos. 
</P>
<P>
Another trademark of Playskool is its ever-changing decor. On one night, every 
wall, every table, every chair, every fixture was covered with aluminum foil; 
on another, hundreds of miniature toy parachutes were suspended from the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete audio and visual experience, nothing at all like the typical 
San Diego nightclub," Zweig said. "You never know what to expect, and this 
suspense, I think, really adds to Playskool's appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a similar roving club in downtown Los Angeles, where Zweig lived 
before moving to San Diego six years ago to study business at San Diego State 
University, Playskool's original port of call was the Hotel San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in October, 1986, Playskool docked every second or third Friday night 
in one of the downtown hotel's basement banquet rooms, regularly attracting 
more than 700 18-and-older trendies. A year later, it expanded into a second 
banquet room, and Zweig began serving alcohol to patrons over the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
That's when his troubles began. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned over the potential for drink-sharing with minors, the local office of 
the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control threatened to revoke the 
Hotel San Diego's liquor license, resulting in the November, 1987, eviction of 
Playskool. (Zweig subsequently filed suit against the hotel for breach of 
contract, since his lease wasn't due to expire until the end of that year; the 
litigation has yet to be resolved.) 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Zweig has continued to keep alive the Playskool concept 
through occasional stagings at the Palisades roller rink in North Park, the 
Soma dance hall downtown and backstage at the San Diego Sports Arena, where the 
"club" will celebrate its three-year anniversary Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
In this month's issue of Details, the flashy New York night-life magazine, 
Zweig placed an ad touting Playskool's upcoming birthday bash. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was about time that San Diego got some national recognition for 
having an alternative to the typical beach-area Top 40 nightclub" scene, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when his troubles began anew. 
</P>
<P>
"Early last week," Zweig said, "I received a phone call from Hasbro attorney 
Jim Montalto, telling me to cease and desist using the Playskool name, which is 
a registered trademark for Hasbro's line of preschool toys. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't, he told me, Hasbro would take me to court and sue me." 
</P>
<P>
Zweig said he argued, in vain, "that because I'm not selling toys, I can't 
imagine anyone confusing Playskool, the nightclub, with Playskool, the toy 
line." 
</P>
<P>
But, even though he offered to change the spelling, Zweig added, the Hasbro 
attorney still said no. 
</P>
<P>
Zweig has since hired an attorney of his own "in an attempt to reach some sort 
of compromise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But, to tell you the truth, it doesn't look very good," Zweig said. "Even if I 
was to change the spelling, which I believe is acceptable under federal 
trademark law, they have enough money to take me to court, whereas I don't have 
anywhere near enough money to properly defend myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I'll probably have to change the name entirely. And that makes me 
feel lousy, because, over the last three years, Playskool has really 
established itself in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"People know the name, and I would very much like to keep it, because it has 
such a good reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, however, I just don't think it's possible." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: After two no-shows, Rod Stewart finally made it to the San Diego 
Sports Arena on Tuesday of last week, four days after he was originally 
scheduled to appear. Unfortunately, his stage-lighting system didn't. It had 
already been shipped to New Jersey, the next stop on Stewart's summer U.S. 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Richter, the concert's production manager, made several frantic phone 
calls before finding a replacement: the system belonging to Tom Petty, who was 
playing that night at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, which, unlike 
the Sports Arena, has built-in stage lights. Petty's system was hurriedly 
trucked down to San Diego and set up, with only minutes to spare. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When the folks at XLTN-FM (104.5 Radio Latina) learned the Gipsy Kings were 
coming to San Diego, they immediately made arrangements for an on-air phone 
interview. After all, the French group's recent hit, "Bambaleo," had caught on 
big with Latino audiences and was still in heavy rotation on the local Spanish- 
language radio station's play list. But, when the much-awaited interview 
finally took place -- three days before the group's appearance last Saturday at 
San Diego State University's Open Air Theatre -- it proved a bust. Radio Latina 
staffers had taken it for granted that the Gipsy Kings speak Spanish. They 
don't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Motley Crue's management team is negotiating with Sports Arena vice president 
and general manager Phil Quinn about leasing the arena sometime in November for 
four days of pre-tour rehearsals. "They came down two years ago, and they loved 
it," Quinn said. "It's close enough to Los Angeles, where they live, but far 
enough away so they can get down to business." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday for Santana's Sept. 2 appearance at the 
SDSU Open Air Theatre, and at 3 p.m. Friday for the Aug. 30 concert by Winger 
at the California Theatre downtown. . . . Sheena Easton's Aug. 17 show at the 
Civic Theatre has been canceled. So has the Desert Rose Band's Sept. 17 concert 
at Humphrey's on Shelter Island.

U.S. STILL BALKS AT LINKING IRAN FUNDS, HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration on Tuesday brushed aside an Iranian hint of help in 
freeing American hostages in exchange for the release of Iranian funds that 
were frozen in the United States after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is the same as it's always been, that we are not willing to link 
the Iranian assets questions to the hostage question," White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. "That fits within the definition of our policy 
of not trading arms or money or whatever for hostages and of not paying ransom 
for hostages." 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times, in a report distributed by the Islamic Republic News Agency, 
called on Washington to guarantee the return the Iranian assets -- estimated 
variously at $2 billion to $4 billion -- as the first step in a process that 
could lead to the release of the American hostages being held by Islamic 
militants in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sure of Husband's Death 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, wife of hostage William R. Higgins, told 
reporters at the Pentagon that it is no longer possible to doubt that her 
husband was killed by his kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
In a stoic statement, she pledged her support to President Bush "as he tries to 
save the living and end the suffering." 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times quoted what it described as a source close to President 
Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying: "The first step should be taken by the United 
States, and if Tehran gets satisfied that its assets will certainly be 
unfrozen, then the second step will definitely come from Iran." 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian assets, including arms purchased by the late Shah Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi but not delivered, were frozen when Washington broke relations with 
Tehran over the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in 1979. Iran long has demanded the 
return of the assets as its price for improved relations with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Iranian assets issue will 
be resolved by the special Iran-U.S. tribunal that is evaluating competing 
claims to the funds. The panel earlier decided to allocate as much of the money 
as is needed to satisfy valid claims by Americans against the Iranian 
government and to return the rest of the funds to Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
There is no possibility that Iran would get the arms purchased by the shah, 
although the value of the weapons has been added to the frozen bank accounts 
and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
"These issues and the process of resolving the questions of the assets have no 
connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater acknowledged that a "good many messages" have been sent between the 
United States and Iran through intermediaries in recent days, but he refused to 
say whether any messages mentioned the assets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Administration's rejection of the Iranian overture on assets, 
Fitzwater said he sees "room for improvement in relations" with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility for a hostage release remains a deal involving the Islamic 
radicals and Israel. However, a senior leader of Hezbollah, the 
Iranian-sponsored group thought to be an umbrella for hostage holders, said the 
organization will refuse to negotiate with Israel unless the Jerusalem 
government first releases Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Shiite Muslim clergyman 
seized by Israeli commandos on July 28. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Sobhi Tofaili said in a statement distributed Tuesday in Beirut that 
"there shall be no contacts and no negotiations" as long as Obeid remains in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal to Israel 
</P>
<P>
U.N. Undersecretary General Marrack Goulding, completing a visit to Israel, 
appealed to Israel to release Obeid without conditions. However, Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin said that Israel would only free the clergyman in 
exchange for hostages including three Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins' wife said that the Marine Corps commandant had told her it is 
virtually certain that Higgins, a Marine lieutenant colonel seized in February, 
1988, while on U.N. peacekeeping duty, is dead. The militants last week 
released a videotape showing a man who resembled Higgins hanging from the end 
of a rope. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to her husband by his nickname, she said, "Rich went to Lebanon in 
the service of the United Nations because he believed he could be useful, that 
he could help and that he was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"To those who would suggest that our concern for Rich should somehow be 
mitigated because he was in a dangerous business or because his act of 
volunteering was supposedly foolish, Rich himself would have the appropriate 
reply: 'When you're out front, people will shoot at you,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time for anger and bitterness, for recriminations and blame. 
Now is the time for calm reflection, for kind thoughts of the man who has 
brought us together. Now is the time to tell Rich Higgins that we love him and 
we miss him."

E. Robert Wallach, a close associate of former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III, was 
convicted Tuesday of racketeering and fraud charges in the Wedtech scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach was acquitted of a separate racketeering conspiracy charge by a New 
York federal court jury. Two associates -- W. Franklyn Chinn of San Francisco 
and R. Kent London of Honolulu -- were convicted on racketeering, racketeering 
conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with payments they received from 
Wedtech Corp., a now defunct South Bronx defense contracting firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facing Up to 20 Years 
</P>
<P>
Each of the defendants faces a maximum sentence of at least 20 years in prison. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Owen set sentencing for Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the verdicts at the end of the three-month trial was delayed 
for about 20 minutes when London's mother experienced breathing difficulties. 
Oxygen was brought into the courtroom, and lawyers told the judge she had a 
history of two heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
As family members of other defendants wept, the judge asked London's mother 
whether she wanted an ambulance. She said she wanted to stay, and the tense 
reading of the verdict continued. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach, 55, told reporters after the verdict: "I am guilty of nothing but 
being in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
Wallach said he was a victim of "prosecutorial contortions of the facts." And 
he defended Meese, saying: "Nothing that happened here casts a single aspersion 
on that man." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury essentially agreed with the government," said the prosecutor, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Baruch Weiss. " . . . They believed the government's 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated for six days on the charges in the 21-count indictment. It 
decided that Wallach had illegally received $425,000 from Wedtech to lobby 
Meese and other officials to help the firm get government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-month trial, in which Wallach and Meese both testified, 
prosecutors alleged that Wallach had received more than $1.1 million in cash 
and stock to lobby his longtime friend on behalf of Wedtech. During that 
period, Meese was a top White House aide and, later, attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The two men have been close since their days as law school classmates at the 
University of California, Berkeley. Wallach is a prominent attorney from San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resigned From Cabinet 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Meese resigned from former President Ronald Reagan's Cabinet after 
an independent counsel criticized his conduct but decided against prosecuting 
him for steps he had taken on behalf of Wedtech, as well as other allegations 
growing out of his ties to Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
At least 15 persons -- including former Rep. Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) and several 
company officers and New York state officials -- have been convicted in the 
Wedtech scandal on bribery, conspiracy, stock fraud and other charges. Former 
White House aide Lyn Nofziger was convicted of lobbying violations on behalf of 
Wedtech last year, but his conviction was reversed this summer on grounds that 
a key section of the Ethics in Government Act is ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that Wallach, Chinn and London, all of whom were 
consultants to Wedtech, defrauded the small firm of nearly $2 million between 
1982 and 1985. Chinn and London helped Wallach conceal the purpose of his 
lobbying payments and assisted him in hiding the money in secret bank accounts, 
some of which were overseas, the government contended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of Stock Fraud 
</P>
<P>
Chinn, 47, and London, 46, were also accused of securities fraud in connection 
with the sale of company stock, as well as defrauding the federal Small 
Business Administration by falsely claiming that Wedtech remained a 
minority-owned firm after it had sold stock to the public in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the racketeering count, jurors found that Wallach had defrauded 
Wedtech stockholders of $300,000 by promising to help the company if he 
received a high appointment from Meese in the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
He received a second illegal payment of $125,000 for attempting to use his 
influence with Meese on behalf of Wedtech, the jury determined. Wallach had 
contended that that payment was a legal fee for helping the company acquire a 
Michigan shipyard, but the jury rejected his argument. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors cleared Wallach of having received a third illicit payment of nearly 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbying Wasn't Illegal 
</P>
<P>
Although Wallach's lobbying of Meese was not illegal, prosecutors sought to 
convince jurors that he had defrauded company stockholders by concealing his 
high-priced lobbying with phony bills for legal services submitted to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Four former officers of Wedtech took part in this fraud and pleaded guilty to 
related charges in 1987. Two of them, Mario Moreno and Anthony Guariglia, 
testified against Wallach on behalf of the government. They were branded 
"professional liars" by Wallach's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
During six days on the witness stand, Wallach said that he first had tried to 
help the Bronx-based firm obtain federal contracts in 1981, without being paid 
for his services. He said that he thought it deserved an opportunity to succeed 
because it provided needed jobs in a community composed primarily of minority 
members and underscored the Reagan Administration's effort to build support 
among Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach said that the next year he began receiving consulting and legal fees 
from Wedtech for a variety of services. He said his contacts with Meese were 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him (Meese) if there was anything that could be done, appropriately, 
to help them out," Wallach testified, referring to Wedtech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Got Navy Contract 
</P>
<P>
The firm obtained a $32-million Army engine contract without competitive 
bidding after an aide to Meese convened a White House meeting to put pressure 
on Army officials, according to evidence at the trial. Later, the company got a 
Navy pontoon contract that ultimately was worth more than $400 million, but its 
performance on the job was rated by the government as "poor." 
</P>
<P>
Meese, in his testimony, said that he had never shown Wallach favoritism, 
despite their frequent contacts about Wedtech and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
But, under persistent cross-examination by prosecutors, Meese acknowledged that 
his dealings with Wallach were far more extensive than he previously had 
admitted. He said that, at the time his friend was lobbying for Wedtech, he had 
seriously considered giving Wallach a top position at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
The former attorney general was at West Point, N.Y., on Tuesday night to give a 
speech at the U.S. Military Academy and was not available for comment on the 
verdict, said a spokesman, Pat Korten. 
</P>
<P>

QUAKE JOLTS N. CALIFORNIA; 1 KILLED IN FALL 
</P>

<P>
A sharp earthquake centered on or near the San Andreas Fault struck Northern 
California early Tuesday, apparently causing a 19-year-old man to panic and 
plunge to his death from a fifth-story apartment window. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.2-magnitude earthquake brought scores of calls to police and fire 
departments. Eleven aftershocks, including ones of 4.2 and 4.8 magnitude, 
followed Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was near the confluence of the San Andreas and Sargent faults, 
about halfway between San Jose and Santa Cruz near Lake Elsman, a small 
reservoir in the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Gatos, southwest of San Jose, Matthew J. Bignall, 19, apparently was 
jolted awake by the earthquake, rushed to his bedroom window and crashed 
through its fiberglass screen to his death. 
</P>
<P>
Bignall's half brother, Ronald Burder, with whom he was living, speculated that 
Bignall was not thinking clearly when the quake struck. Probably half asleep, 
the young man simply "freaked out" and bolted for the window, perhaps 
forgetting that he was five stories up, Burder said. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake hit at 1:13 a.m. and rumbled for about 10 seconds. It was felt 
as far away as San Luis Obispo, about 230 miles south of San Francisco, in 
Tracy, 55 miles to the east, and in Sonoma County, 60 miles north, state 
emergency services officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Kawano of the state Office of Emergency Services said there was "only 
minor damage in the affected county area," including broken glass, chipped 
plaster and items that fell from shelves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Not Happy 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Clara County, Sheriff's Deputy Tom Abraham said numerous house and car 
alarms were tripped. Like many people living in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz 
counties, Abraham was jolted from his sleep by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy about it at all. It's all about feeling helpless. I myself lost 
a number of things off shelves, off the mantle," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz County, rocks tumbled onto roads and highways, but were cleared 
in time for the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It bounced me out of bed pretty good," said Tom Mounts, emergency preparedness 
manager of the San Jose Office of Emergency Services. "I don't know of anyone 
who slept through the first one." 
</P>
<P>
Mounts said the San Jose Fire Department responded to a few reports of leaking 
gas and water lines and one small fire at a San Jose hospital that might have 
been quake-related. 
</P>
<P>
Bignall probably never experienced an earthquake of the magnitude of Tuesday's 
jolt, at least not since he was a young child, Burger said. Burger said he had 
been in a deep sleep when the quake hit, causing the apartment building to sway 
violently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Was Scared to Death' 
</P>
<P>
"I seriously thought the building was going to come down and we were going to 
die in the rubble like Mexico City," Burger said. "I was scared to death. I 
know he was too." 
</P>
<P>
Bignall had lived in California until age 10, when he moved with his father to 
the Midwest. He returned during his time in the Navy, having been stationed for 
a time in San Diego. Upon his discharge from the Navy three months ago, he 
moved to Burger's Los Gatos apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't tell what went through his mind, possibly instant panic," said Sgt. 
Tom Mitchell of the Los Gatos Police Department. "The screen from the window 
has an indentation very like a person's head, so it looks like he dove through 
the window or fell through." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell repeated the common wisdom that the safest place in an earthquake is 
in a doorway or under a table, and that people should "under no conditions run 
outside; seek shelter inside." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Quake 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was about a mile from the epicenter of another earthquake 
estimated at 5.0 magnitude last June 27, suggesting that the area is becoming 
more active after a period of relative dormancy for most of this century. 
</P>
<P>
"To have two of them in just over a year does point to higher activity," said 
Dr. Andy Michael, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. "That area in 
1865 had a magnitude 6.5 earthquake. . . . When we start having magnitude 5 
earthquakes, it gets us a little worried." 
</P>
<P>
The state Office of Emergency Services warned on Tuesday that there is an 
increased likelihood of more earthquakes in the coming days in the area. The 
stretch of the San Andreas near the epicenter can produce earthquakes of at 
least 6.5 magnitude, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simulation Staged 
</P>
<P>
The shaker came as 500 county, state and federal emergency response experts, 
along with scientists, military officials and Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, 
Marilyn, gathered in a cavernous building in Sacramento for an exercise 
simulating a massive 7.5-magnitude quake along the Hayward Fault. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey believes that the Hayward is the fault most likely 
to result in a catastrophic quake in the northern part of the state during the 
next 30 years. Such a quake could result in 10,000 deaths and 40,000 injuries 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Quayle, whose pet project is disaster relief, said she did not feel the 
earthquake. But she added that when she turned on her television in her hotel 
room and saw a report of the earthquake, she thought, "Gee, it's interesting, 
they already have the simulation on the news." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emergency Plan 
</P>
<P>
Several others at the exercise also thought that the reports of the earthquake 
were part of the game. Mrs. Quayle spent the morning overseeing the exercise, 
moving from station to station and taking notes. 
</P>
<P>
The simulation to continue today is based on a 1987 plan by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency detailing the responses of various governmental 
agencies and private organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have learned from cases such as Mexico City and Armenia that we probably 
better not wait for an earthquake to occur to see how the program works," said 
Larry Zensinger, an FEMA official and chief exercise controller.

REPRESSION IN CHINA CALLED ECONOMIC BLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>

<P>
The Chinese government's repression of the pro-democracy movement aggravated 
already severe economic problems that now seem certain to spread social unrest 
among China's workers and peasant farmers, who make up the bulk of the 
population, the CIA predicted in a report issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The preoccupation of China's leaders with consolidating power, restoring 
ideological orthodoxy and maintaining social order (following the crackdown on 
the democracy movement) will probably prevent them from formulating new 
solutions to the country's economic problems," the CIA said. "Consequently, 
China's reform program is likely to be bogged down for the next few years." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the June 3-4 massacre in Beijing, China was facing the worst 
inflation since the Communists seized control in 1949, a growing unemployment 
rate and a troublesome balance-of-payments deficit, the report to a 
subcommittee of the congressional Joint Economic Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the Chinese leadership would seek to regain popular 
support by easing an austerity program instituted last year to combat an 
inflation rate of 19% a year that reached as high as 30% in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Competing pressures to increase spending will probably prevent the 
retrenchment program from bringing inflation under control," the CIA said. "In 
urban areas, inflation will probably remain above 20% through the end of 1990; 
nationwide, inflation is also likely to remain in double digits for at least 
the next 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the persistent inflation will fuel urban unrest by 
eroding the living standards of many Chinese workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Beijing may also worry that peasants might become restive because they are 
being pressed to grow more grain but are having increasing difficulty obtaining 
inputs and payment from a financially strapped government," the CIA added. 
</P>
<P>
If the unrest spreads to workers and peasants, it would create far more severe 
problems for the leadership than the pro-democracy movement, which was 
concentrated among students and intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Joint Economic Committee's 
subcommittee on national security economics, said the report indicates China's 
reform efforts were too timid from the start and now have been stopped in their 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"The clock is running backwards for the Chinese economy," Bingaman said. "A 
decade of economic reform may have effectively come to a standstill with the 
crackdown in Tian An Men Square. . . . An unfortunate lesson for Westerners is 
that economic reform in socialist countries is not irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
The CIA said the central government's preoccupation with social and political 
issues will lead to a sort of unplanned and unintended decentralization of 
economic decision-making. The result, the report said, could be even greater 
problems for the leaders in coping with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Local governments will probably strongly resist implementing austerity 
measures in their own areas -- for example, by resuming some of the 
construction projects that central authorities canceled early this year," the 
report said. "This resistance will be especially strong in wealthy southern 
provinces, where reform and an open door to Western business have yielded 
significant economic benefits." 
</P>
<P>
The CIA also said that China may be forced to drastically expand credit to 
foreign-funded business ventures to overcome the chill in investment and trade 
prompted by the violent crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"In speeches since the crackdown, (paramount leader) Deng Xiaoping has 
reiterated his commitment to pursue economic reform," the report said. "The 
main elements of Beijing's market-oriented reform program, however, have been 
stalled for almost a year. Such key reforms as price decontrol and bankruptcy 
are likely to be postponed indefinitely because Beijing does not want to add to 
its problems by implementing measures that would raise prices and swell the 
ranks of the urban unemployed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It added, "Without further reform, however, China will be unable to alleviate 
the imbalances in its economy."

ENERGY CONSERVATION BACK ON FRONT BURNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an urgency reminiscent of the 1970s oil crisis, California is being nudged 
into an era of energy efficiency in which energy-guzzling light bulbs and 
window glass will be upstaged by remarkable new conservation-oriented products. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with compelling evidence that California utilities have led a return to 
energy gluttony, a coalition of regulators, scientists, businesses, 
conservationists -- and even the reluctant utilities themselves -- is preparing 
a blueprint for changing the way energy is used. 
</P>
<P>
The effort, spurred by an unusually outspoken California Public Utilities 
Commission, could position California to catch up with energy-conscious Japan, 
reduce fossil fuel pollutants from power plants, better respond to fears over 
global warming and save Californians billions of dollars in needlessly high 
energy bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Just so the utilities know where we stand, conservation and (energy-efficient) 
management are now back up on the front burner," said PUC President G. Mitchell 
Wilk. 
</P>
<P>
If the effort succeeds, Californians will be offered an array of proven -- but 
thus far ignored -- 1980s technology, such as light bulbs that last for years 
using a fraction of the normal energy and window glass that repels summertime 
heat. Instead of seeking out new power sources, the utilities will hire firms 
peddling "negawatts" -- ways to cut energy use. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful PUC took up the issue July 20 after release of a report by the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, the group that successfully fought the use 
of the chemical Alar on apples, showing that the state's big utilities have cut 
conservation programs by 56% since 1985. California, once the nation's 
conservation leader, has backslid so badly that an estimated $1 billion in 
energy is being wasted annually, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley W. Hulett, a PUC member, asked for "a blueprint for energy efficiency" 
by Christmas and chided the utilities, whose executives in the mid-1980s 
decided that plentiful energy justified dismantling many efficiency programs. 
Laudable past gains, Hulett said, "do not excuse what we have done in the last 
three to four years." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Rosenfeld, a leading physicist and energy expert at Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory, called the PUC's stand "historic." 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioners were telling us they were embarrassed that they were asleep 
at the wheel," he said. "And that means change is coming." 
</P>
<P>
The breadth of the problem has also prompted the California Energy Commission 
and South Coast Air Quality Management District to urge a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
With such a broad consensus, prominent scientists and industry executives said 
firms selling energy-efficient equipment and techniques could become 
California's hottest new growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The savings achievable are so dramatic that many people simply don't believe 
it," said Amory Lovins, a Colorado conservation expert whose state-of-the-art 
home and office in the frigid Rocky Mountains generates only $5 in monthly 
energy bills. The alterations paid for themselves in one year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lovins said screw-in "compact fluorescent bulbs" have the life span of 10 
incandescent bulbs, use one-quarter the energy and, despite their $11.50 
wholesale price, will quickly pay for themselves in a typical home. Reflectors 
that intensify lights without adding heat and fixtures that stop fluorescent 
bulbs from flickering can cut office lighting bills 50%. And because the new 
office lighting does not overheat rooms, air-conditioning bills are sliced in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld said "low emissivity" glass, coated with transparent film that keeps 
out heat, could save energy equal to all the oil pumped annually through the 
Alaska pipeline if installed in homes and buildings nationwide. The glass is 
slightly more costly than conventional windows. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't buy (the new light bulbs and other items) because they are not in 
Safeway," Rosenfeld said. "The natural market will take 30 years to absorb 
(these products), but we don't have that sort of classical leeway left." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC stressed that the hardware and ideas brought out in the blueprint 
should include incentives to spur the utilities. Moreover, the programs should 
pay for themselves in the form of lower bills and rebates without the 
sacrifices equated with old-style conservation. Industry experts said the 
programs, to be administered by the utilities, are likely to include: 
</P>
<P>
* An end to the utilities' traditional practice of building or expanding power 
plants whenever they need more megawatts. Where a moderately sized 50-megawatt 
plant was once required, a "negawatt' contractor would be hired to find a way 
to prevent 50 megawatts of energy from being wasted in a region. 
</P>
<P>
* Prodding industries and businesses to install new products ranging from 
cost-cutting machine gears and drive belts to the low emissivity windows and 
polarized plastic ceiling tiles that cut computer screen glare and allow lights 
to be dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
* Incentives for constructing above-standard buildings. Developers still 
install conventional lights, windows and heaters to reduce up-front costs, 
creating energy-guzzling buildings. High energy costs accumulate for the life 
of the structures, representing billions of dollars in losses. (In downtown Los 
Angeles, few of the dozens of newer office towers are above standard. One 
exception is the high-tech Ronald Reagan State Office Building now being 
built.) 
</P>
<P>
* Paybacks for residents who "super-weatherize" their homes by plugging unseen 
leaks now easily detectable with air-suction devices. Programs might pay for 
ceiling, wall and floor insulation, heat-repelling windows and whole-house fans 
instead of air-conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
* Educating municipal agencies. For instance, cities can surface streets with 
light-colored materials, replacing heat-absorbing blacktop that, along with 
other man-made structures, has helped turned Los Angeles into a "heat island," 
in which temperatures are rising one degree per decade. 
</P>
<P>
While defending past conservation cutbacks, utility executives have agreed to 
collaborate on ways to adapt these ideas for California. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have all the answers, but we're sure the one way to get them is to 
work together," said Robert H. Bridenbecker, vice president of customer service 
for Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not only accept but encourage proper incentives," said Virgil Rose, 
vice president and general manager of distribution for Pacific Gas &amp; 
Electric. 
</P>
<P>
However, John Phillips, co-chairman of the Boston Edison Co. Collaborative, a 
group helping the Boston utility company create energy-efficiency programs, 
cautioned that California's utilities may not be joining the effort out of 
conviction, but in response to public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
On July 21, in the first of many informal meetings held to draw up the energy 
blueprint for the PUC, utility officials rejected the Natural Resources Defense 
Council's suggestion that Phillips use his Boston experience to help them come 
up with a preliminary plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind being rejected, especially in this business, but the idea was to 
collaborate, and frankly I walked away feeling very, very uneasy about the 
utilities," Phillips said. "Will they come up with anything creative, after 
being left to themselves all these years and coming up with a 56% cut in 
conservation?" 
</P>
<P>
Another warning came from David Morse of the PUC's Division of Ratepayer 
Advocates, who questioned whether the utilities should need incentives to 
support efficiency. Given the PUC's unique system, in which utilities already 
profit whether or not they sell more or less energy, Morse said, "they 
shouldn't need financial incentives to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Many industry-watchers trace the utilities' resistance to the mid-1980s when 
new executives rose at Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison 
and elsewhere who seemingly had little interest in the scientific strides being 
made in energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council, top 
people in the conservation departments were laid off as marketing departments 
grew. Disillusioned conservation experts moved to out-of-state utilities, 
"where the action was," he said, and soon after, conservation efforts in 
California began spiraling downward. 
</P>
<P>
While California hesitated, West Germany and Japan bolted ahead with dramatic 
innovations. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory said Japan needs just one-half the 
energy required by the United States to produce an equivalent one dollar of 
gross national product -- a disparity that gives Japan a tremendous financial 
advantage. Aside from the apparent reluctance by the utilities, there are other 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Charles R. Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission, recently 
told the PUC that by the year 2000 less than half of California's housing stock 
will have been built according to efficiency standards adopted in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of older, poorly insulated homes represent "an unsqueezed sponge" of 
potentially vast energy savings, Imbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
But the building industry is so disparate, with many thousands of contractors, 
engineers, architects and designers unaware of the new technology, that new 
labeling and standards may be needed on lighting, fixtures, windows and other 
building materials before much retrofitting occurs. Such retrofitting might 
occur, for instance, when houses are remodeled or resold. 
</P>
<P>
Lovins and other scientists say they also still face persistent "disbelief" 
over new energy-saving devices that seem almost too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I was consulting for a company in El Segundo, and they told me: 'But we're 
already energy efficient,' " Lovins said. "So I pointed out that if they had 
(constructed) all their buildings with available technology, their worldwide 
net profits would go up 56%." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such hurdles, there is growing optimism that California is leaving the 
age of energy waste behind. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hall, a contractor who tried for years to persuade the utilities to promote 
super-weatherizing, recently super-weatherized an older house in La Verne for 
$3,000, avoiding the need for a $4,100 central air conditioner and immediately 
cutting the homeowner's energy bills by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly I'm getting calls from state legislators asking about these programs, 
and the other day two guys from the gas company took me out to lunch to pick my 
brain," Hall said. "It's a whole new day." 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY-SAVING TECHNOLOGIES 
</P>
<P>
 Chart shows how much energy could be saved in the United States if just two of 
several energy-efficient technologies now available were adopted nationwide. 
Savings are shown in net annual costs, as well as in the number of power plants 
whose energy production would not be needed and oil platforms whose 
construction could be avoided.

DAVIDIAN TO TAKE OVER EZELL'S INS WESTERN REGION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Davidian, the chairman of the California Agriculture Labor Relations Board 
for the last 2 1/2 years, was named Tuesday as the top immigration official in 
the West, succeeding the colorful and controversial Harold Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Davidian, who admitted having no experience in the politically 
sensitive field of immigration, had been the leading choice to become Western 
regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
"He does have outstanding credentials," said David Runkel, chief spokesman for 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. "We think that he will bring a degree of 
professionalism to the office." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian's predecessor, Ezell, had a penchant for making statements that 
enraged many Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we can grow from the terrible era of 'Rambo' Ezell and make history 
with Davidian," said Amin David, the head of Los Amigos de Orange County, a 
Latino activist group. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian, who is expected to start work Monday at the INS regional headquarters 
in Laguna Niguel, replaces Robert M. Moschorak, a career INS official who was 
named last month as a temporary replacement for Ezell after he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The post is considered a key one since the immigration agency is in the midst 
of handling the second phase of the 1986 amnesty law. More than 60% of the 3 
million immigrants who applied for legal resident status are in the INS' 
Western region, which includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and the 
Pacific island of Guam. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian, a Fresno native whose paternal forebears came from Armenia, faces two 
difficult hurdles when he assumes his post. 
</P>
<P>
First, he admits to a lack of experience in the immigration field. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically represents a continuation of Ezell's ignorance and policies since 
he has no experience," said East Los Angeles immigration attorney Antonio 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"It's troubling to say the least," added Vibiana Andrede, a staff attorney with 
the National Center for Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. "We've gone from a hot 
dog vendor to a know-nothing." 
</P>
<P>
(Ezell was an executive with the Der Wienerschnitzel Corp. when he was 
appointed to the INS Western commissionership in 1983.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, Davidian has been criticized by liberals who say he has dealt unfairly 
with farm workers since he was named chairman of the ALRB in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"He is anti-Latino and definitely pro-grower," said Dolores Huerta, co-founder 
and first vice president of the United Farm Workers. "Under his leadership, the 
ALRB no longer looks after farm workers." 
</P>
<P>
The panel, created in 1975, considers cases of alleged unfair labor practices 
and disputes surrounding farm union-representation elections. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Davidian, contacted late Tuesday at his office in Sacramento, 
said the criticism is not new or fair. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just not so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that similar criticism of inexperience was made of him when he 
was named to the labor panel, and he said he has a sound grasp of agricultural 
labor issues. He expects to do the same with immigration. 
</P>
<P>
He also denied he was anti-Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"That is such unfounded baloney," he said. "When they have nothing else to 
criticize me for, they always fall back to that." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian was scheduled to leave for Washington today for briefings on 
immigration policies and procedures before returning to California to assume 
his new post. 
</P>
<P>
He has a bachelor's degree from the University of Utah and a law degree from 
the Hastings School of Law at UC San Francisco. He practiced law in Sacramento 
and San Francisco before heading the ALRB. 
</P>
<P>
Silver reported from Washington. Ramos reported from Los Angeles.

FIRING OF WORKER BECAUSE OF AIDS BARRED IN RULING 
</P>

<P>
A state appeals court has ruled for the first time that California firms cannot 
discharge employees because they have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 ruling by the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura on Monday found 
that a state law banning job discrimination against the handicapped applies as 
well to people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very precedent-setting," said Jean O'Leary, executive director of a Los 
Angeles-based National Gay Rights Advocates. With the ruling, "every major 
corporation in America has been (placed on notice) not to discriminate against 
people with AIDS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The court upheld a $6,000 award by the state Fair Employment and Housing 
Commission to the estate of John E. Chadbourne, a Santa Barbara man who was 
refused permission to return to work by Raytheon Electromagnetic Systems 
Division of Goleta after he was diagnosed with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Raytheon put Chadbourne on medical leave in December, 1983, and refused to 
reinstate him in January, 1984, despite a doctor's statement that he was fit 
and posed no health danger to others. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Chadbourne filed a complaint with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
A quality control analyst, Chadbourne had performed mainly clerical duties and 
received uniformly high performance reviews and maximum pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
Chadbourne remained on medical leave at 75% salary until his death in January, 
1985, at age 36. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, the state employment commission ruled that Raytheon violated 
a state law forbidding job discrimination against the physically handicapped. 
Raytheon appealed in Santa Barbara Superior Court, but Judge Patrick McMahon 
held that Raytheon denied Chadbourne's plea for reinstatement even though it 
knew that AIDS could not be transmitted by casual social contact. 
</P>
<P>
A Raytheon spokesman declined to comment on the verdict or a possible appeal.

INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOUND TO CHARGE 2 IN BOY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing insufficient evidence, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
said Tuesday it will not file charges for now against two teen-agers who had 
been suspected of killing Jason Matthew Lea, a 9-year-old Upland boy whose body 
was found last week at the bottom of a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two, Wayne O. Hobbs, 19, was ordered released after he and Richard 
LaLonde, 18, were placed in custody at the sheriff's substation in Walnut 
Sunday when they surrendered. LaLonde, however, was expected to remain jailed 
on an outstanding probation violation stemming from a crime he committed as a 
juvenile, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Hearnsberger said that, after reviewing the case, there 
was "insufficient evidence" to charge the two young men with the Lea boy's 
death -- in part because the Los Angeles County coroner's office has not yet 
completed its investigation and has not yet determined precisely how Jason 
died. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was conducted, but it failed to reveal a cause of death. Tests were 
continuing, according to Hearnsberger. 
</P>
<P>
Two other teen-agers, ages 16 and 17, also were taken into custody in 
connection with the investigation. They are being held at San Bernardino County 
Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Jason disappeared on July 29 after leaving his home in Upland, in San 
Bernardino County, on his bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have told police that he was last seen that night with several 
teen-agers. His bike was found outside a popular video arcade on Foothill 
Boulevard in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
Jason's partly decomposed body was found Friday by the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's San Dimas Search and Rescue Team at the foot of a 200-foot cliff on 
Glendora Ridge Road, near the Mt. Baldy ski area, just inside the Los Angeles 
County line. The ski area is familiar to police as a "party rock" where 
teen-agers often gather for late-night revelry. 
</P>
<P>
Upland Police Capt. Martin Thouvenell, one of the initial investigators on the 
case, called the decision to release Hobbs and LaLonde "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
"We felt there was enough there to go forward, but (the district attorney) did 
not think the evidence was there yet because of the delay at the coroner's 
office," Thouvenell said. "If it's a natural death then we don't have a 
homicide. So we'll just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent television reports suggesting that Jason was under the influence 
of LSD after his abduction and may have overdosed, Thouvenell said he has no 
evidence confirming such stories. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking for some bizarre circumstances here, some satanic cult-type 
thing," Thouvenell said. "The reality is probably much simpler than that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Is a Lawman 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Hobbs, whose father is a San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy, 
and LaLonde could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But friends -- many of 
whom had insisted that the accusations against the two teen-agers were a 
mistake -- expressed relief that charges were not filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel real happy because I knew he was innocent," said Mike Kasbeck, 15, who 
lives down the street from Hobbs and went skateboarding and snake collecting 
with the older youth. "I feel sad that he got dragged into it, though. It just 
doesn't seem fair." 
</P>
<P>
Kasbeck said he had talked to Hobbs on Friday, the day Jason's body was found, 
and recalled that the teen-ager mentioned he had lent his white Ford pickup 
truck to one of the two juveniles in custody. 
</P>
<P>
"He was telling me, 'Don't ever let anybody borrow your car, because it will 
only get you in trouble,' " said Kasbeck, noting that Hobbs was popular among 
younger friends who lacked transportation. "I figure he was trying to be nice 
and loaned (the suspects) his truck so they could have a good time. And then 
they went and messed his life up." 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs' attorney, Barry Plotkin, said that while the truck may have been 
involved in the episode, his client did not willingly lend it to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"My client did not take part in this thing," Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Kasbeck said that Hobbs' parents, Diane and Gary Hobbs, were also convinced of 
their son's innocence when he spoke with them Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They were sad about the whole thing but knew Wayne wasn't guilty," Kasbeck 
said. Hobbs' surrender Sunday night had been arranged by his parents and 
detectives, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Tuesday, sheriff's spokesman Pat Hunter said authorities plan to 
transfer the two suspects still in custody from San Bernardino County Juvenile 
Hall to a maximum-security juvenile facility in East Los Angeles. Although the 
teen-agers are from Upland, the case is being handled by Los Angeles County 
officials because Jason's body was found just west of the San Bernardino County 
line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Postponed 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, whose identities are being withheld because of their age, were 
scheduled to be arraigned Monday. But a judge postponed the hearing until 
Thursday to give their attorneys time to review police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have released little information about a possible motive in the 
crime, saying only that the four teen-agers were acquaintances who hung out at 
Upland Bowl together.

PRESIDENTS' CALL MAY BRING NEW SALVADOR PEACE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On its face, the call by the presidents of five Central American countries for 
"a constructive dialogue" to end El Salvador's civil war does little to advance 
a settlement of the nine-year conflict, but some officials and diplomats say it 
provides both sides with a face-saving way to open new peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I think we can expect both the government and the FMLN (the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front, the Marxist guerrilla organization) to come up 
with some new proposals, using Tela as the excuse," one Latin American diplomat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Conviction 
</P>
<P>
He referred to a statement issued Monday in Tela, Honduras, by the presidents 
of Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, in which they 
"reiterate their firm conviction about the need for an immediate and effective 
cessation of hostilities" in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The section of the statement dealing with the war here, part of a larger 
agreement to close Nicaraguan rebel camps in Honduras, went on to say that the 
presidents "vehemently urge the FMLN to carry out a constructive dialogue to 
achieve a just and lasting peace (and) . . . urge the government of El Salvador 
to arrange, with full guarantees . . . the incorporation of the members of the 
FMLN into peaceful life." 
</P>
<P>
Although El Salvador and the United States say this means that the five 
presidents endorsed a demand for rebel disarmament, the accord does not call 
for the rebels' demobilization and their integration into the system until "the 
FMLN agrees through dialogue to abandon the armed struggle." 
</P>
<P>
This effectively divorced the Salvadoran conflict from the solution worked out 
to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel camps by early December. That solution was 
based on the more advanced negotiating process and the establishment of an 
international mechanism to oversee the disarming and relocation of the 
Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's claims that the Tela agreement 
supports his position for immediate FMLN disarmament, officials here said 
Cristiani is working on a plan to rejuvenate a "dialogue commission" empowered 
to talk with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
He called for formation of such a group "to hold immediate talks" with the 
rebels when he took office June 1. But it was never formed, and the rebels said 
there was no basis for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN, in a statement issued Tuesday over its clandestine radio, said it 
"reaffirms its will to contribute to the work of the political parties, the 
(Roman Catholic) archbishop and other social forces to arrange a dialogue and 
begin negotiations with the government." 
</P>
<P>
In line with that call, FMLN leaders are said by supporters here and in other 
countries to be preparing what one source called "a truly serious" plan to 
negotiate an end to the fighting, which has killed an estimated 70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the FMLN's first meaningful offer, without the conditions that made 
their plan last year unworkable," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Proposals 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks before the country's presidential elections last March 19, the 
FMLN made several proposals that in essence called for the rebels to end the 
war and participate in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
However, the government would not agree to postpone the voting for the six 
months demanded by the FMLN, nor would the rebels accept counterdemands that 
they disarm before the balloting and agree to a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
The sources would not disclose any details of the new plan. But they said its 
overall scope has been approved in principle by Nicaraguan President Daniel 
Ortega, who reportedly has urged the FMLN to reopen negotiations with 
Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
FMLN leaders met July 29-30 in Mexico City with officials of El Salvador's 
major opposition party, the Christian Democrats, who agreed the rebel approach 
was serious.

BOLIVIA TO DO ITS PART IN DRUG FIGHT, LEADER VOWS

LA PAZ, Bolivia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jaime Paz Zamora, the new president of Bolivia, says his administration will do 
its part in the fight against cocaine traffic as long as the cost is not an 
undue burden on this impoverished country. 
</P>
<P>
"Bolivia is prepared to enter this fight, but not (by) paying a bill by itself 
that others should also pay," Paz Zamora told reporters late Monday, a day 
after he took office. 
</P>
<P>
After neighboring Peru, Bolivia is the world's No. 2 producer of coca leaves, 
the raw material of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Paz Zamora, a left-leaning nationalist, said Bolivia recognizes that it "must 
be part of the international fight against narcotics traffic." But he made it 
clear that the extent of Bolivian cooperation will depend on the amount of aid 
it receives from the United States and other developed countries where cocaine 
use is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Problem 
</P>
<P>
"In Bolivia there is awareness that the problem is international," he said, 
"and therefore Bolivia cannot by itself pay a bill that belongs to many." 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia will keep "a kind of balance" in the fight against narcotics, he said. 
"We must have our own account balance in the sense of meeting our commitment 
together with the international community, but constantly check our accounts to 
see if our commitment . . . is hurting our country or is benefiting us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to go into any kind of fight that is demanded of us, to the 
extent that this fight does not mean that we Bolivians end up more impoverished 
. . . we are saying to the international community that the fight against 
narcotics traffic costs money. It must be financed." 
</P>
<P>
Paz Zamora emphasized the need for economic development in areas where peasant 
farmers have a hard time making a living if they do not cultivate coca. 
</P>
<P>
He said his administration will try to "perfect" an anti-narcotics law passed 
last year by the Bolivian Congress. The law, which sets deadlines for farmers 
to voluntarily eradicate illegal coca crops, was drafted and pushed through the 
Congress at U.S. urging. 
</P>
<P>
Paz Zamora has said in the past that farmers should receive more compensation 
than the $2,000 per hectare (2.5 acres) that is now offered for voluntary 
eradication. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials have privately expressed concern about the commitment of 
Paz Zamora's political party, the Revolutionary Left Movement, to full 
cooperation with U.S. anti-drug policy. During the campaign, some members of 
the party reportedly advised farmers not to eradicate their crops before the 
election because they could receive more compensation under a new 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
The eradication program failed to meet its first quota this year, and the 
United States withheld $5.8 million in scheduled financial aid to Bolivia.

KGB FINDS SHIFT TO GLASNOST DIFFICULT, CHIEF SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The long-feared KGB, struggling to adapt to greater openness in Soviet society, 
has rewritten its rules for the first time in 30 years so secret agents will 
spend less time spying on ordinary citizens, the agency's chief said in a 
remarkably candid interview published Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov also reiterated that the KGB and its American counterpart 
in many respects, the CIA, should begin exchanging intelligence information to 
combat terrorism and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
But Kryuchkov said he has faced a tough challenge in trying to "plant into the 
minds of our staff the necessity of changes." 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, this is not a simple chore. We are dealing with approaches, 
methods, customs which have been consolidating for years and years," he said in 
the weekly New Times. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov, who was trained as a lawyer and worked as a state prosecutor before 
serving for a decade as the deputy chairman in charge of foreign intelligence, 
was named head of the KGB in October, 1988. Last month he was reconfirmed to 
the post by the new Parliament, the Supreme Soviet, after tough questioning. 
</P>
<P>
During the confirmation debate, he drew titters of disbelief when he tried to 
paint the KGB as an agency intended only to serve the Soviet public. 
</P>
<P>
In the New Times interview, he appeared more willing to publicly acknowledge 
that the agency, long considered pervasive in Soviet society, sometimes abused 
its powers under the cover of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing when you know that absolutely no public control exists and 
quite a different thing when you are operating under the permanent gaze of the 
citizens," he said. "Previously it happened that state interests had priority 
over civilian needs. This is no longer possible." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get used to glasnost (openness), to psychologically adapt," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov revealed for the first time that the KGB had abolished what he called 
its "Fifth Department," whose task was to "exterminate ideological diversions" 
-- a reference to citizens who were viewed as traitors for criticizing the 
Communist Party, sometimes even in private conversations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordinary Travelers 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the agency has stopped monitoring "ordinary citizens who 
travel abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov said that in an effort to win public support, the KGB planned to 
publish a draft of its new regulations. "I believe the sooner we do that, the 
sooner we will put an end to the uncertainty" about the agency's role in 
society, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he hopes to receive government approval to publicly reveal the KGB 
budget, which has always been classified. 
</P>
<P>
"We see it as imperative that society sees and understands what we are doing," 
Kryuchkov said, adding that such openness is necessary to win the trust of the 
public and enlist its help in fighting new challenges such as organized crime 
and industrial espionage. 
</P>
<P>
Organized crime in the Soviet Union, the KGB chief said, "is now growing. . . . 
We haven't yet reached the level of the West, but if we neglect this disease, 
it will become a real torture for our society." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kryuchkov said, the agency has to be on the lookout for foreign 
industrial espionage. Soviet managers, dealing for the first time on a wide 
scale in cooperative ventures with Western firms, are "poor businessmen . . . 
(and) provincial simpletons," and give away secrets without realizing it, 
Kryuchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said there also is a fresh opportunity for cooperation with the CIA and 
other Western security agencies. He hinted that the Soviet Union had provided 
the United States with intelligence after Israel's abduction of a Lebanese 
Shiite Muslim leader and threats against the lives of American hostages held in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get information that someone's life is in danger, we are trying to pass 
that information on," he said. "They highly value this and try to reciprocate."

EMBARRASSED BONN CLOSES ITS MISSION IN EAST BERLIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
West Germany closed the doors of its diplomatic mission in East Berlin on 
Tuesday in an effort to deal with about 130 East Germans who have crowded in, 
hoping to get emigration documents. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans have refused to leave the five-story building and are sleeping 
on mattresses on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has embarrassed the Bonn government and angered East German 
authorities, who have charged that relations between the two countries could be 
jeopardized by the mission's sheltering of East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
East German officials said that allowing East German visitors into the West 
German offices in East Berlin constitutes "crude interference in the sovereign 
affairs" of the Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Rudolf Seiters, an official of the chancellor's office, said that his 
government has a duty to offer humanitarian aid to those who seek it. He added, 
however, that it is not officially encouraging East Germans to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is interested in depopulating East Germany," Seiters said, "but it is 
quite clear that East Germany must reform if it wants to resolve the problem of 
the ever-growing number of people wishing to emigrate." 
</P>
<P>
A parallel to the situation in East Berlin was taking place at West German 
embassies in Budapest, Warsaw and Prague, where vacationing East Germans have 
sought advice, shelter and asylum. Many are camped out in the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials, who said the mission will be closed until further 
notice, have made it clear to all would-be emigrants that it cannot issue 
travel documents because the governments of East Germany, Hungary, Poland and 
Czechoslovakia will not recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
They said that if West Germany were to issue West German passports or travel 
documents, it would be subjecting the East Germans to criminal charges of 
possessing illegal documents. They are telling the East Germans to go home and 
apply officially through East German channels. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not expel them from our embassies," a West German official said. "In a 
few hours or days, most realize they must leave, since there is no point in 
remaining inside our buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The situation in East Germany has been aggravated in recent weeks, diplomats 
here said, by continuing repression in East Germany while the Soviet Union, 
Poland and Hungary are taking a more liberal attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Many East Germans have fled to the West through Hungary since the Hungarian 
government decided in May to remove the wire fences along its border with 
Austria. Hundreds of East Germans, after obtaining permission to vacation in 
Hungary, have then slipped across the border into Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans, for fear of embarrassing Hungary and angering East Germany, 
have declined to make public the number of East Germans who have come West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Wait for Approval 
</P>
<P>
Some East Germans have been allowed to emigrate, but only after applying 
officially through their government and waiting for months or years for 
approval. In the past year, officials here said, the East German government has 
approved a higher number of applications than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
West German sources say that at least 2,500 East Germans are in jail for trying 
to escape to the West. 
</P>
<P>
If an East German succeeds in getting to the West, the West Germans will issue 
him or her a passport and grant citizenship, because Bonn has never legally 
recognized the division of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But East Germans generally face weeks in a refugee camp here waiting for work 
and housing.

NORTH ORDERED TO DELAY START OF SERVICE WORK

Oliver L. North was told to stay away Tuesday from the church where he was 
scheduled to begin 1,200 hours of community service work in an anti-drug 
program, apparently to avoid touching off a media circus. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Project Save Our Youth Inc. said that North's probation officer, 
Ralph Ardito, said U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell told North to 
delay his participation in the program in an effort to avert a wave of media 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Ardito) said Judge Gesell does not want the press hounding North . . . 
does not want this to turn into a super-hero situation," project coordinator 
Don Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, who sentenced the former White House aide for his role in the 
Iran-Contra scandal, "did not want any press coverage relating to North's work 
or any unnecessary gathering of the press," Lewis quoted Ardito as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The judge was on vacation in Maine, and Ardito was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Project officials said they were not sure when North would begin the community 
service, or exactly how to limit media coverage when he does. 
</P>
<P>
North, who was fined $150,000 and ordered to do community service for three 
felony convictions in the scandal, attended a two-hour orientation Monday and 
had been scheduled to start work Tuesday afternoon at Project SOY, a nonprofit 
group operating out of a church in northwest Washington.

KEMP PLEDGES TO HALT GOP INFLUENCE PEDDLING

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp declared Tuesday that he will 
take back his agency from "Republican influence peddlers." 
</P>
<P>
In a well-received speech before the National Urban League's annual conference 
here, Kemp declared also that he intends to help America's blacks achieve the 
long-elusive promise of equality. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's scandal-plagued agency is the subject of investigations into charges 
that funds for low-income housing have been siphoned off to pay consulting fees 
to the rich and influential, but Kemp pledged to "make HUD work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reforms Promised 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make it work for the poor and the needy. We're going to take 
the greedy and the consultants and the Republican influence peddlers out," he 
said. "You can count on me to reform HUD from top to bottom. I've got the 
President on my side, and I know I've got the American people on my side. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want it to work for the Democratic National Committee; it shouldn't 
work for the Republican National Committee. It's got to work for the people." 
</P>
<P>
The secretary characterized his efforts to revitalize HUD as "cleaning it out 
and making it work for poor people, not greedy people." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's remarks were interrupted frequently by applause. He invoked the American 
Revolution's dream of liberty as well as imagery from the Civil War and the 
current anniversary of the government's "War on Poverty" as he made an 
impassioned plea for his free market solution to racial and economic injustice. 
</P>
<P>
The speech implicitly acknowledged what one league officer called the 
government's "meanness" and neglect of the problems of the poor and minorities 
during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
After saying that "there is a burgeoning revolt on the greed that has dominated 
our national life," Kemp added that HUD will work "on behalf of those who have 
been left behind." 
</P>
<P>
He lamented the low levels of black home ownership and called for greater 
investment in new and rehabilitated housing. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp urged an end to "the disgrace of redlining," a practice in which lenders 
write off impoverished areas as bad risks. He called for a reduction in taxes, 
both for the rich and poor, to spur the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have a country that is prosperous and poor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp recalled how, in the 1950s and '60s, when he played professional football, 
he was unaware of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize that something was happening in America that would help 
complete the American Revolution," he said. "That revolution is still 
unfinished." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Urban League has set a goal of racial parity by the year 2000 
and promised to participate in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We're 11 years away," he said. "It's time to get started." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Denver, the Department of Justice filed a $1-million civil suit 
Tuesday against Douglas R. Turner, a former HUD accountant accused of stealing 
money earmarked for low-income families. The suit seeks possession of a car and 
real estate that Turner allegedly purchased with the money. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Turner set up a phony company and funneled Section 8 
moderate rehabilitation program funds into it between December, 1988, and May, 
1989. A criminal investigation is also under way, Denver U.S. Atty. Michael J. 
Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp did not mention the lawsuit in his comments to the Urban League, but he 
said that he is working hard to make the agency "open for business."

WRIGHT'S BOOK DEAL PROBED BY U.S. GRAND JURY;

DOCUMENTS SUBPOENAED FROM 3 GROUPS LINKED TO PURCHASES OF VOLUME

A federal grand jury is investigating former House Speaker Jim Wright's book 
deal and has subpoenaed documents from at least three groups that directly or 
indirectly bought bulk copies of "Reflections of a Public Man," for which 
Wright earned royalties of 55%. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department refused Tuesday to disclose the nature of the 
investigation. Attorneys for two organizations said it involved Wright's book, 
and a spokesman for a third said it had been ordered to produce documents 
related to the former congressional leader. 
</P>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee, after a year of investigating, said it had reason 
to believe that Wright, a Texas Democrat, had tried to evade House limits on 
outside income through bulk sales of the book. That investigation ended with 
Wright's resignation in June. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Southwest Texas State University and the National Assn. of 
Realtors said that they had received subpoenas from a federal grand jury here. 
A spokesman for Ocean Spray, a cranberry and citrus growers' cooperative in 
Massachusetts, said documents from that group also were being sought by the 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Texas attorney Bill Fly said that the university received a subpoena, 
dated July 14, on Monday and has until Friday to submit documents concerning 
Wright's speech at the school in the fall of 1984 and the subsequent purchase 
of $3,000 worth of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Laurene Janik, general counsel for the realtors' organization, said his group 
is responding to a grand jury subpoena relating to Wright's book. Ocean Spray 
spokesman John Lawlor said the company did not want to discuss details of the 
subpoena, other than to confirm that "they are limited to matters relating to 
the former Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Shannon, administrative assistant at Wright's office in Ft. Worth, said 
the investigation appears "very routine" and that it resulted from the media 
attention focused on Wright during the ethics investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the agency's inquiry is 
continuing. "I can't comment on any aspect of the investigation, except I will 
confirm that it is ongoing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fly said the university had agreed to pay Wright $3,000 for a speech. After 
Wright's appearance, someone in the Speaker's office called the university to 
say Wright had reached his limit on outside income. Wright's staff member then 
asked if the Speaker could use the $3,000 to purchase copies of his book for 
the university, Fly said.

FORCE SHRIMPERS TO EQUIP NET WITH TURTLE PROTECTOR DEVICES, JUDGE URGED

<P>
The National Wildlife Federation on Tuesday asked a federal judge to force the 
Commerce Department to require Gulf Coast shrimpers to equip their nets with 
turtle excluder devices. 
</P>
<P>
The department's temporary new regulations limiting trawl times do not protect 
endangered sea turtles as the department claims, the federation argued. 
</P>
<P>
The federation said it has learned that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher 
has data from National Marine Fisheries Service scientists that demonstrates 
the mortality rate from a 105-minute tow time is more than four times greater 
than what the secretary has admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher on Monday announced regulations requiring shrimpers to lift their 
nets every 105 minutes to let any captured turtles escape. 
</P>
<P>
"A recent report from the team of scientists charged with managing recovery 
efforts for the severely endangered Kemp's Ridley sea turtle states 
unequivocally that the species is physiologically unable to withstand tow times 
in lieu of required (excluder) use," the federation said in its petition to 
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan is overseeing the federation's legal attack on Mosbacher's failure to 
require excluder devices. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan last week ordered Mosbacher to adopt regulations by Monday to protect sea 
turtles from drowning in shrimpers' nets. 
</P>
<P>
A new federal law requires shrimpers to use excluder devices -- big boxes 
attached to nets with hinged sides that turtles can swim through -- unless the 
secretary of commerce has good reason to require other protective measures. 
</P>
<P>
The trawling regulation is to last only until Sept. 7 while the department 
solicits comment on what permanent regulations to adopt "in light of 
conservation needs of sea turtle populations and the economics of the shrimp 
fishing industry."

METEORS, ECLIPSE WILL BE STARS OF SKY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be something for everybody in the nighttime sky during the next few 
weeks, including a meteor shower this weekend and a total eclipse of the moon 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
August will also bring the astronomical highlight of the year when the aging 
Voyager 2 spacecraft zips over the cloud tops of Neptune on the evening of Aug. 
24. Even the most powerful telescopes on Earth will not be able to see the 
one-ton spacecraft as it visits the fourth and final planet on its "Grand Tour" 
of the outer solar system, but Voyager will beam back thousands of images and a 
warehouse full of scientific data to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Also out of sight will be another, less spectacular event involving the 
smallest planet in the solar system. Pluto will prove that not only is it a bit 
puny, it is also a little tricky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fickle Orbit 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 5, Pluto will make its closest approach to the sun, called perihelion. 
The tiny planet will still be a long way away, about 2.7 billion miles to be 
exact, but the event will prove once again that Pluto can be a bit fickle. That 
is because the highly elliptical orbit that Pluto follows brings it inside the 
orbit of Neptune for perihelion, making it the eighth planet from the sun, not 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Neptune, which is awaiting the encounter with Voyager, is currently the most 
distant known planet in the solar system, and it will stay that way for several 
years until Pluto once again moves outside its orbit. Anyone who misses Pluto's 
approach to the sun this time can catch it again in the year 2236. 
</P>
<P>
While only those equipped with a very powerful telescope will be able to watch 
Pluto's lonely voyage, everyone will have a chance to take part in the Perseids 
meteor shower Friday night and early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 10 significant meteor showers each year, and the Perseids is 
the most prolific. It occurs each August when the Earth passes through the 
debris left behind by a comet known as Swift-Tuttle. The shower has been 
observed for 1,900 years, and in some years up to 100 meteors per hour have 
been seen entering the Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
For years the Perseids were known as "the Tears of St. Lawrence" after a 
Spanish martyr who was killed close to the time of the shower in the year 258. 
</P>
<P>
The meteors enter the Earth's atmosphere at about 135,000 m.p.h., incinerating 
themselves as they plunge through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Fraknoi, executive officer of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 
said observers should be able to see about 50 meteors per hour if they find an 
area removed somewhat from city lights so they have a clear view of the dark 
sky. He also recommends against using binoculars because any such instrument 
will narrow the field of view. 
</P>
<P>
All that is necessary, he said, is to find a dark spot, let your eyes adjust to 
the darkness for about 15 minutes, and then lie back and enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
The total lunar eclipse will occur next Wednesday, Aug. 16, when the Earth 
passes directly between the sun and the moon, capturing the moon in its shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Those watching the event in California will have a slight problem in that the 
eclipse actually begins at 7:28 p.m., a few minutes before the sun sets so it 
will be hard to see it in the early minutes. However, the total eclipse will 
last until 8:56 p.m., so it will be dark long before the show ends. 
</P>
<P>
As the eclipse ends, the moon will become more and more visible as it emerges 
from behind the Earth and into sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Shutterbugs should have no trouble capturing the event on film, weather 
permitting. Dennis Mammana, resident astronomer at the Reuben H. Fleet Science 
Center in San Diego noted that exposure settings for "shooting the moon" are 
the same as for any other object in full sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Threat to Eyes 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an eclipse of the sun, a lunar eclipse poses no threat to the eyes of 
observers on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
There is yet another possibility in this smorgasbord of astronomical delights. 
The Space Shuttle Columbia was launched Tuesday on a secret military mission, 
reportedly carrying a spy satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the shuttle follows an orbit that keeps it well south of California, 
but if the reports of its cargo are correct, it should have been launched into 
an orbit that will carry it to more than 50 degrees above the Equator. That 
would bring it over California repeatedly until it ends its five-day mission at 
Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
This being a secret mission, there is no way of knowing when the shuttle will 
pass over California, but anyone who sees a faint light rising in the east and 
zipping to the western horizon in about three minutes should be advised that 
was no meteor.

ROBERT F. JANI, 55; NOTED PRODUCER OF SPECTACULARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert F. Jani, who produced such spectacular celebrations as the U.S. 
Bicentennial celebration in New York Harbor in 1976, a revitalizing stage show 
for Radio City Music Hall, halftime entertainment at the Super Bowl and some of 
the Walt Disney organization's most storied events, has died. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for his firm, Robert F. Jani Productions, said he had died Sunday 
night at his Palos Verdes Estates home after a three-year struggle with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known commonly as Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 
55. 
</P>
<P>
Both on his own and with the Disney company, where he worked for 11 years, Jani 
put on much of the live entertainment that has become standard fare at 
Disneyland and Disney World. Among his achievements were "America on Parade," 
"The Main Street Electrical Parade" and, as a consultant, master plans for Euro 
Disneyland (to open in 1992) and the new Disney/MGM Studio Tour at Walt Disney 
World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he was responsible for the revival of Radio City Music Hall's 
"Magnificent Christmas Spectacular." That was the year he left Disney's employ 
to found his firm. From 1979 to 1982, he was in charge of all live stage 
productions at the New York City hall, dubbed the "Showplace of the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
He had taken over the hall after a 35-day restoration and was credited with its 
revitalization after a long period of decline. His other productions there 
included "America," "Encore" and "Manhattan Showboat." 
</P>
<P>
Jani also staged the 1983 Super Bowl entertainment in which spectators amazed 
themselves and a national television audience by spontaneously hoisting 103,000 
synchronized flash cards into the air, filling the Rose Bowl with bright 
rainbows. It was believed to be the biggest stunt-card spectacular of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Jani drafted the master plan but did not provide the staging for the opening 
and closing ceremonies at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. That contract 
eventually went to David L. Wolper. In 1981, Jani produced "The Glory of 
Christmas," with a cast of 400 and a small zoo of animals at the Crystal 
Cathedral in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Joan; his mother, daughter and son. Contributions 
are asked to the USC Neuromuscular Center at 637 S. Lucas Ave., Los Angeles 
90017. A memorial service is scheduled for Monday at 4 p.m. at the Rolling 
Hills Covenant Church in Rolling Hills Estates.

HUBERT BEUVE-MERY; FOUNDER OF FRENCH NEWSPAPER LE MONDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hubert Beuve-Mery, who founded the independent Le Monde in 1944 at a time when 
other Parisian newspapers stood accused of Nazi sympathies and then 
meticulously nursed it into France's most influential daily, has died at the 
age of 87, the newspaper announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Beuve-Mery died Sunday night in Fontainebleau, where he had been hospitalized 
for the last week after a fall, Le Monde said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great leader," Jacques Fauvet, Beuve-Mery's successor as 
editor-in-chief and publisher of Le Monde, said on French radio. "He had great 
independence of spirit and moral authority at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
The austere tabloid, its gray expanses only recently disturbed by photographs, 
became known for its authoritative and thorough coverage of foreign and 
domestic affairs, complete with footnotes in tiny print. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a constant emulation between those who read a newspaper and those who 
edit it can permit the pursuit, with some chance of success, of this quest for 
truth, which is our principal reason for being," Beuve-Mery wrote on his 
retirement in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Le Monde has always been left-of-center, but marked by an independence from 
political parties that was unusual in French journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Under a complicated distribution of stock, the Le Monde staff has control of 
the newspaper. The staff members also elect the newspaper's director, who 
serves as editor-in-chief and publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Beuve-Mery was born Jan. 5, 1902, in Paris, where his father was a jeweler and 
watchmaker. He was correspondent for the Paris daily Le Temps in Prague from 
1934-38, when he resigned in protest over the paper's approval of the German 
invasion of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
When France was liberated in 1944, Le Temps and other prewar newspapers tainted 
by the occupation were not allowed to resume publication. Beuve-Mery and a 
small group of liberal journalists and intellectuals were asked to start a new 
newspaper in the old Le Temps building on the Boulevard des Italiens near the 
Paris Opera in an effort to rebuild French prestige. 
</P>
<P>
They were encouraged by Gen. Charles de Gaulle, but De Gaulle later had his 
problems with the paper's left-leaning approach to international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Beuve-Mery guided Le Monde's fortunes for the next quarter of a century, 
writing occasional editorials under the pseudonym "Sirius." 
</P>
<P>
Still required reading for the influential throughout the French-speaking 
world, Le Monde's influence in recent years has waned some as Frenchmen opted 
for more modern, brassier publications. 
</P>
<P>
It survived a financial crisis in 1985 by selling about a 12% share in the 
newspaper to its readers.

JACK SMITH: SILENTS, PLEASE -- A MOVIEGOER LOOKS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orpheum Theater, between 8th and 9th streets on Broadway, is a time 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
We walked into it one night last week and were back in the '20s. We had come to 
see the 1927 silent movie "The Student Prince," starring Norma Shearer and 
Ramon Novarro. 
</P>
<P>
The showing was one in the third annual "Last Remaining Seats" program 
sponsored by the Los Angeles Conservancy. Essentially, the theater had hardly 
changed since I patronized it on Saturday afternoons as a schoolboy. But it was 
grimy. Graffiti covered the men's rest room. It was warm and humid. But the 
Renaissance and Gothic grandeur remained intact. We sat in the balcony between 
the two heavy chandeliers. It occurred to me that it would not be a good place 
to be in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
My anxieties dissolved when the organ rose, front and center, and Gaylord 
Carter turned to face the almost sellout audience. Incredible. He had turned 84 
that day. He had played throughout the first run of "The Student Prince" at the 
Million Dollar Theater in 1927. Here he was to play it again. 
</P>
<P>
The first short subject was "Precious Images," a powerfully nostalgic montage 
of clips from 60 years of movies. They flashed by at less than a second each; 
we hadn't time to say the names of the stars or the movies; yet every clip 
inspired a surge of recognition. So profound a part of our lives the movies 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
A Harold Lloyd short began with a simple introduction: "The plot -- A boy is in 
love -- the rest just happens." How many movies have been based on little more 
than that. Lloyd really loves his Model-T Ford roadster, which of course turns 
against him. Carter played with sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
For "The Student Prince," Carter improvised from Sigmund Romberg's score for 
the musical, the lyrical waltzes, the stirring marches, the fraternal drinking 
song. I had wondered how they could make a silent "Student Prince." They 
didn't. Obviously, it had been anticipated, in 1927, that the film would be 
accompanied by an orchestra, an organ, or at least a piano. Despite the playful 
touches of director Ernst Lubitsch, without the accompaniment of Gaylord Carter 
the film would have been an intolerable bore. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a beer hall full of rowdy students singing Romberg's drinking song in 
silence. Synchronizing with their lips, Carter created the illusion of raucous 
male voices. He never rested. When the camera rose to show the castle on a 
hilltop, he played castle music -- if there is such a thing. When Shearer and 
Novarro chased each other through fields of wildflowers, he sent up a swirl of 
romantic airs. 
</P>
<P>
I was reminded of my cousin Donald. In the 1920s he played the piano for 
Saturday night movies in the Women's Club of Shafter, a farm center northwest 
of Bakersfield. Shafter was the sticks. It didn't even have a moving picture 
theater. Donald couldn't play the piano; he played a player piano. But with his 
fewer skills, he tried as hard as Carter to match the music to the scene. 
Invariably, when someone was dying, he played "Nearer My God to Thee." It was a 
much-worn roll. 
</P>
<P>
Shearer was not a great actress. She wasn't even beautiful. Her face was too 
long. So was her nose. But in "The Student Prince" she is required only to be 
coy, passionate and heartbroken. Novarro had only to express youthful charm, 
buoyancy and naivete. Both were equal to those tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Since you will probably never see the movie, it can't hurt to disclose the 
plot. Novarro is a crown prince. He is raised behind palace walls. As a young 
man he is sent to Heidelberg, where he falls in with the students and learns to 
drink beer chug-a-lug. He falls in love with Shearer, an innkeeper's niece. 
When the old king dies, his last request of Novarro is that he marry a princess 
and carry on the family line. Novarro, urged on by the king's advisers, gives 
his word. Finally he goes back to Heidelberg to tell Shearer that, though he 
may never see her again, he will never forget her. Believe me, that takes 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 8 the conservancy is showing "Bringing Up Baby," with Katharine 
Hepburn and Cary Grant, at the Westlake, across from MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss it if you can.

NEW AND USEFUL: A FULL-SIZE BICYCLE THAT CAN BE FOLDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dissatisfied with conventional bicycles that are too cumbersome to transport 
and folding bicycles that are too small, Harry Montague, a Washington, D.C., 
architect and cyclist, developed a first -- a full-size, all-terrain bicycle 
that can be folded in half in seconds without tools. 
</P>
<P>
His Montague BiFrame made its American and Canadian debut earlier this summer 
and is available nationwide at more than 250 BiFrame dealers. It costs about 
$500 and has an optional $125 water-resistant Cordura carrying or storage case. 
When folded, the bike measures 3-by-3-by-1 1/4-feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The BiFrame is a bicycle that folds, not a folding bicycle," said Montague's 
son David, vice president of Montague Corp. "We designed a full-size bicycle 
and then added a folding feature that doesn't alter the bike's appearance or 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
To fold the BiFrame, cyclists simply remove the front wheel, unlatch two 
quick-release levers on the seat tube and swing the front half of the bike 
around. The BiFrame weighs 29 pounds, comes in two frame sizes, 18 1/2 inches 
and 20 1/2 inches, and has 18-speed index shifting and 26-inch wheels. It is 
available in bright red or royal blue. 
</P>
<P>
Although an all-terrain bicycle, the BiFrame is "an urban bike," David Montague 
says, because it is easy to carry into an office and easy to store in an 
apartment, condominium or dormitory. "And it's also easier to protect. There's 
no need to lock it in a stairwell or to a parking meter." 
</P>
<P>
Among Southern California shops selling the BiFrames are Bicycle Shack in 
Studio City, Budget Bike in Los Angeles, Coates Schwinn in Pomona, Circle Cycle 
in Torrance, Smith Cycle &amp; Key in Lomita, Newport Heights in Newport Beach, 
Ocean Schwinn in Huntington Beach, Huntington Valley Schwinn in Fountain Valley 
and Schwinn Plus in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
To find a store in your area that carries the BiFrame, contact Montague Corp., 
P.O. Box 1118, Cambridge, Mass. 02238; phone, (617) 491-7200.

Sun Shield for Babies 
</P>
<P>
Parents concerned about their babies getting that hot summer sun in their faces 
may be interested in Flap Hats, infant headgear specially designed to help 
protect babies from sun and wind. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Lipson Snyder of Venice designed the little hat for her son, Cody, 
because she got "frustrated looking for a hat that had all the elements to 
really protect my fair-skinned baby from the sun." Her hat has an elongated 
bill to keep bright sun out of a child's eyes and a "camel flap" in the back to 
shade baby's neck and ears. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfect for the beach, backpacking, camping or anywhere under the sun," 
Snyder said. Flap Hats, fully lined in cotton, come in various colors and in 
small (newborns-15 pounds), medium (13-22 pounds) and large (21-36 pounds). 
They're available for $7.95, or in flannel or fleece for $9.95 or $10.95 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Flap Hats can be bought at Cousin's Children's Stores in Thousand Oaks, Culver 
City, Sherman Oaks and Mission Hills; My New Friends in Santa Monica; 
Kendrick's for Children in Torrance; Juvenile Shops in Los Angeles and Sherman 
Oaks; Safe Baby in Studio City; Fred Segal Melrose in Los Angeles; and Sid's 
Baby Furniture in Westchester. Or contact Flap Happy, 2322 Walnut Ave., Venice, 
Calif. 90291. From Southern California call (213) 391-1316; outside this area, 
call (800) 234-3527. LYNN SIMROSS

CONSUMER VIEWS: HOW MUCH LIFE INSURANCE IS ENOUGH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have been thinking of changing my life insurance policy to one 
that's less expensive. Presently I have a supplemental life insurance policy 
from the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., of which I am a member 
due to my past employment. They said this is the only one I qualified for due 
to my retirement status. The policy is for $17,500 and I pay $13.15 a month. 
They told me the face amount decreases as I get older, and the monthly premiums 
stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
I feel that this is not a very good policy, and there are no dividends either. 
I have just sent for information on two policies I have seen advertised on TV. 
Both are advertised by well-known people and both are for $6.25 a month. I have 
been told that these are also bad policies. -- R.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I didn't include the names you mentioned of the two personalities 
advertising these policies, because there is quite a battalion of them all 
doing the same thing, and they all have the same expertise in life insurance 
that I have in nuclear fission. To mention two of the half dozen or so engaged 
in this selling frenzy might imply that the others have more validity. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Robert Hunter, president of the Alexandria, Va.-based National 
Insurance Consumer Organization is concerned, "I have yet to see one of the TV 
specials that I consider any good at all." 
</P>
<P>
There are a few points almost universally glossed over in these sales pitches, 
Hunter adds. First, he points out, most have (commonly) a two-year waiting 
period before they pay any benefits. If you die before then, your heirs get 
back only the premiums you paid. Second, that bargain-basement price of $6.25 
is usually for a "unit," and a unit normally translates to about $1,200 of 
coverage.

Once signed up, the mail barrage is likely to begin to sign you up for 
additional units -- commonly, again, five units -- which means that you are 
paying $31.25 a month for $6,000 of coverage. That premium is far more than you 
are now paying for almost three times the coverage. And third, like your 
present policy, most TV specials are also decreasing term. 
</P>
<P>
"At some cut-off point," Hunter says of decreasing-term insurance, "the $1,200 
unit starts shrinking, and, by age 80 or so, there are no benefits left. So, 
you can't die in the first two years, and you can't live too long, either." 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of any life insurance policy taken out later in life -- at 
retirement age, for instance, which seems to be your situation -- "the 
fundamental question to ask yourself," Hunter says, "is, 'Do I really need any 
life insurance?' If you have some retirement benefits and if you have Social 
Security and if the children are grown, then chances are good you don't need 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Dependents," he continued, "are really the key. If they aren't grown, or if 
you have a handicapped child, then you can put it in a different light. 
Otherwise, most people need only enough life insurance to take care of final 
expenses."

ALICE KAHN: SHE'S GONE THROUGH THICK AND THIN WITH LIZ TAYLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was eating a giant burrito and thinking about Liz Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean this as a Liz Taylor/fat joke. I don't do Liz Taylor/fat jokes. I 
could if I wanted to. I mean, what is she, some kind of sacred cow? 
</P>
<P>
No, I wasn't laughing at Liz. I'm in no position and in the wrong dress size to 
laugh at Liz. 
</P>
<P>
I was just trying to understand our great national pastime, our obsession with 
whether Liz is fat or thin. 
</P>
<P>
There's got to be something other than idol curiosity operating here. Perhaps 
someone has figured out a correlation between the stock market and Liz Taylor's 
body. Does the Dow go down when Liz goes up? 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who've been with Liz through thick and thin know there is some 
profound connection between our lives and Liz's thighs. We remember: Liz, the 
lean years -- the Michael Wilding, Michael Todd and all the Michaels in-between 
years. 
</P>
<P>
We remember Liz and Richard, the bejeweled and besotted days of yore. We think 
back to Liz (Mrs. John Warner) the happy hausfrau. We recall Liz and George 
Hamilton -- the desperate years. We remember Liz so recently thin as a reed 
riding high on Malcolm Forbes' hog. Then Liz redux, big and back in the Betty 
Ford again. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable thing about Liz is that even though she is everything we are not 
-- a star, a goddess, a rich and famous, diamond-covered queen -- we share with 
her the double life. We have our fat life and our thin life. We understand 
wanting to hide out until the next 10 pounds fall. Or 30. We know what it's 
like to look at our own photo albums as a series of before-and-after pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Like Liz, we are never quite there. We are always working on our perfection or 
our downfall. We are either wallowing in our Size 16s or gloating in our Size 
9s. We are either regal in Puerto Vallarta or bloated at Studio 54. We are 
either accepting the adoring looks of men or seeing our expanding behinds as 
the butt of brutal jokes. 
</P>
<P>
A while back, there was a well-selling book called "The Goddess in Everywoman." 
I've never related to this mystical goddess bit. If you want to talk about a 
mystery, look at a man. Not a word. Not a clue. The sphinx in every guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatsa matter, Dirk?" you ask Dirk as he sits there sulking. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing. Nothing. I don't want to talk about it," he says with that 
read-my-sealed-lips enigmatic shrug. 
</P>
<P>
There is no goddess in everywoman. There's just someone eating because she 
feels bad or dieting because she wants approval. There is Liz in every one of 
us. Liz is we and we are she, and we are all together. 
</P>
<P>
Take away the money. Take away the jewels. Take away the husbands. Take away 
National Velvet, Cleopatra, Virginia Woolf and you know what you've got? You 
and me, girls. And the Can't Keep It Off Diet. 
</P>
<P>
So don't go making any Liz Taylor/fat jokes around me. I'm on her side. I'm 
hoping that someday Liz and Marlon can eat ice cream all day and still look 
like they did on my movie star trading cards in 1955. Because if Liz and Marlon 
can't keep it off, then what hope have we who are mere mortals? 
</P>
<P>
Ask not for whom the scale tolls. It tolls for thee.

The Bolshoi by any other spelling is still the Bolshoi. So the Bolshoi Theatre 
and its Western representative, the Entertainment Corp., have obtained an 
injunction in London against the "Bolschoi on Ice" tour scheduled for the 
United Kingdom and the United States later this year. An Entertainment Corp. 
executive said that "putting a c in the name makes no difference. . . . 
Bolshoi, however it may be spelt, is allied to one of the world's greatest 
ballet and opera companies" and has been misappropriated by the 3-year-old ice 
show. The Bolshoi Ballet, currently selling out at London's Coliseum and due to 
tour the U.S. next year, has no connection with the ice show. ALEENE MacMINN

Nielsen Media Research on Tuesday signed a multimillion-dollar contract to 
develop a Latino ratings service with the two largest Spanish-language 
television operators, Univision Holdings Inc. and Telemundo Group Inc. 
Executives of the two companies said the Nielsen Latino ratings will help them 
attract spending by advertisers and agencies who in the past have been 
skeptical about the estimated size of the Spanish-language TV audience. The 
service will be tested this fall in Los Angeles area. ALEENE MacMINN

A strike by the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers against members 
of the League of Resident Theaters -- which locally includes the Mark Taper 
Forum, the Los Angeles Theatre Center and South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa 
-- was narrowly averted Tuesday when the society signed a four-year agreement 
with the league. The terms of the contract "fall far short of the union's 
stated goals," according to a statement released by the society, but its 
executive board voted to accept the league's final offer anyway and to 
recommend ratification by its membership. The new contract, retroactive to last 
April 15, runs to April 14, 1993. Except for some percentage increases, details 
of the new agreement were not made public. ALEENE MacMINN

"thirtysomething," noted for occasionally flouting TV dramatic conventions with 
dream sequences and offbeat fantasy episodes, may break the mold again next 
season with a live episode, producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick said 
Tuesday. Although they would not reveal the plot, Herskovitz said, "So much of 
what we do in our show is to interpret reality for people. The notion of doing 
something live . . . gives us certain opportunities you can't get on film." The 
episode would air live on the East Coast and be seen on tape delay here in the 
West. ALEENE MacMINN

A FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS FOR AN EMERGING INSTRUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, Woodard is a free-lance writer based in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionally a loud supportive voice from the back of the orchestra, the 
trumpet has been slowly coming up in the ranks. In fact, this weekend, two 
separate events in the Southland will usher the trumpet to stage center. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic is hosting a "Trumpet Summit" at Hollywood Bowl on 
Thursday night, featuring guest artists Doc Severinsen and Hakan Hardenberger, 
as well as the entire Philharmonic trumpet section. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the International Trumpet Guild will hold its annual conference 
at UC Santa Barbara, Thursday through Sunday. While the timing of these events 
may have been serendipitous, the trend is not: The trumpet has been working its 
way out of the section for years. 
</P>
<P>
"The trumpet is an instrument which will have more and more focus in classical 
music life," said Hardenberger, the Swedish-born soloist who will make his 
debut with the Philharmonic. "It is an instrument that suits the modern person 
and the modern concert hall." 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward the trumpet began, it is generally acknowledged, with the 
high-profile career of Maurice Andre. In the '80s, Wynton Marsalis' twin 
careers in jazz and with classical repertory also helped to pique public 
interest in the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only public interest," Hardenberger said. "For the first time in 
history, the greatest composers are writing for our instrument, which has not 
been the case at all before. I think it's because this is an instrument with 
such an enormous range of dynamics and emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Karon, a lecturer in trumpet at UC Santa Barbara and this year's guild 
conference host, is convinced that, while the trumpet may have been "coming 
out" in recent years, its lure has never waned. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout history, the trumpet has been an important part of people's lives," 
he said. "I don't think there is anybody who wouldn't recognize the trumpet." 
</P>
<P>
The guild is a worldwide organization with a 4,000-musician-strong membership, 
covering various styles. That diversity is part and parcel of the guild's 
intent, according to Karon. 
</P>
<P>
"Even for the players who go to this thing, the trumpet has become rather 
specialized," Karon said. 
</P>
<P>
"People who play jazz don't usually go play with a symphony orchestra, and 
people who play in the orchestra don't usually go and play in jazz clubs at 
night. So I wanted to be able to provide a good cross-section." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Karon mapped out a wide-ranging conference schedule that includes 
classical repertoire as fresh as the premiere of Robert Rodriguez's "Invocation 
of Orpheus" (commissioned by the guild) and as ancient as the music of the L.A. 
Baroque Orchestra, featuring the West German Friedemann Immer, a 
natural-trumpet specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Other guests at the Trumpet Guild conference will include L.A.-based jazz 
players Bill Watrous (and his big band) and Clay Jenkins, Cuban jazz legend 
Arturo Sandoval, French virtuoso Eric Aubier, the Montreal Symphony trumpet 
section, the Japanese ensemble Trumpets 5, and Mariachi Sol de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Bowl, the concept of a full-scale concert devoted to the 
trumpeter's art is new even to Hardenberger, 38, who has found international 
success as a professional trumpet soloist. "There are occasions when trumpet 
players get together and just perform for each other," Hardenberger said, "but 
(the concert) is something else, a very good idea." 
</P>
<P>
The Bowl program presents a portrait of the trumpet as both a solo voice and in 
ensemble, for up to seven parts. 
</P>
<P>
Doc Severinsen is a rarity to be both a jazz player and an orchestral soloist; 
Hardenberger exists in the relatively lonely realm of the trumpet soloist. 
After studying in Paris, his teacher, Pierre Thibaud, persuaded him that there 
was life beyond the symphony trumpet section. He went on to study further with 
Thomas Stevens, the principal trumpeter of the L.A. Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Hardenberger promotes and commissions new works for the trumpet. A coming 
recording project focuses on works written for Hardenberger by British 
composers Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies and Michael Blake Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
At the Bowl, Hardenberger will play the 1948 Trumpet Concerto by French 
composer Henri Tomasi, the most contemporary piece in a program that also 
includes Mozart, Richard Strauss, Biber and Altenburgh. The Tomasi work has 
become a pillar in the expanding dimension of trumpet repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the first big trumpet concertos in which the trumpet is featured 
in not too silly a way," said Hardenberger. "There is too much prejudice 
involved in trumpet writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the biggest challenge for a composer who writes for the trumpet today 
is to write something which does not have the circus aspect, is not 
militaristic and is not jazz influenced. If they can do that, then they're 
really good," he said with a laugh.

JAZZ NOTES : FIVE PIANISTS TO PERFORM AT EVANS TRIBUTE; PAGE EIGHT CONCERT TO 
BENEFIT LIBRARY FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Broadbent, Pete Jolly, Mike Lang, Mike Melvoin and Ross Tompkins -- five 
of the Southland's most celebrated pianists -- will gather to pay tribute to a 
departed fellow master of the keyboard, Bill Evans. 
</P>
<P>
The concert -- Saturday at the Musicians' Union Auditorium, 817 N. Vine St., 
Hollywood, 8 p.m. -- is a benefit for Jazz Central, a nonprofit organization 
that allocates funds for jazz scholarships (it recently contributed to the 
Shelly Manne Memorial Scholarship Fund) and for performances in local schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We scheduled a couple of the pianists, and then some others called up and 
asked if they could play a tune or two, but we didn't want to get too many," 
says Dan McKenna, Jazz Central's executive director, of the Evans tribute. 
"We've had concerts before where all the players who wanted to didn't get to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
The tribute will also feature vocals by Ruth Price and a guitar chorus or two 
from Mundell Lowe, one of the musicians credited with discovering Evans in the 
early '50s in New York City. Evans, who was one of the most harmonically 
innovative of pianists, died in 1980. Information: (213) 257-2843. 
</P>
<P>
BUCKS FOR BOOKS: Saxophonist Lynn Johnston and the improvisational group Page 
Eight -- with drummer Charles Pagano and bassist Carey Fosse -- will perform at 
the Eastlake Victorian Inn in Angelino Heights on Sunday, 3:30 p.m. The event 
is part of a four-concert series to raise money for the Los Angeles Public 
Library's Central Library Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised in Los Angeles, and I used to go to (Central) library all the 
time," says the inn's manager, Michael Whitmore, who also plays guitar in Page 
Eight. "When it burned down (in April, 1986), it was a real disaster, and as 
longtime L.A. residents, we wanted to do something for the area." 
</P>
<P>
Of the musicians performing, Whitmore describes Johnston -- who has played with 
reedman Vinny Golia and the Universal Congress Of -- as "really aggressive. 
He's kind of like a screaming-type sax player who has a warm sound when he 
wants to. He plays in the extremes." Of Page Eight, Whitmore notes: "We like 
taking standard songs, blues and bossa novas and shifting them. We try to 
maintain a sense of order, so that it doesn't just wander, but it's still 
pretty free-form." 
</P>
<P>
The inn is located at 1442 Kellam Ave. Information: (213) 250-1620. 
</P>
<P>
SIMPATICO TRIO: Tommy Flanagan, the gifted pianist who renders the bebop 
repertoire with consummate musicality, brings his trio, spotlighting his 
longtime musical partner, bassist George Mraz, to the Loa in Santa Monica this 
Friday-Sunday. Flanagan, who rarely plays Los Angeles, squeezes his local 
engagement in between a two-week stint at Manhattan's Sweet Basil nightclub 
(with a tribute concert to Bud Powell at Alice Tully Hall thrown in for good 
measure) and a trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan -- who between the late '50s and the late '70s was regularly employed 
as an accompanist, primarily for singer Ella Fitzgerald -- finds Mraz the ideal 
compatriot. "He's so musically correct in so many areas," says the pianist, 
whose latest LP is "Jazz Poet" (Timeless). "He has good feeling, his intonation 
is about perfect, he's very sympathetic to what's around him and he doesn't 
overplay. By that I don't mean that he doesn't dazzle you, but he's always in 
balance with the whole group. 
</P>
<P>
"(Drummer) Kenny (Washington, who has played with Flanagan for two years) is 
the same. He has a lot of knowledge for a young cat and that youth gives you a 
spark," adds the 58-year-old keyboardist, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan continues to play jazz classics like Powell's "Bouncin' With Bud," 
Thelonious Monk's "I Mean You" and Billy Strayhorn's "Raincheck," though he 
says, "We're always adding something new." He admits he does re-orchestrate his 
versions occasionally. "I change the tunes around, don't change the melodies, I 
mean, but change inner structures," he says. "That way you keep it fresh so 
people won't hear it the same way. Duke (Ellington) did that -- played the same 
tunes but rearranged them to keep them sounding new." 
</P>
<P>
MODERN CHAMBER JAZZ: Aurora, a spirited, invigorating trio that calls itself "a 
chamber ensemble of the '90s," appears Sunday at McCabe's in Santa Monica. 
"We're a 'chamber group' because we're all listening hard to each other while 
we play, like chamber musicians," says tenor saxophonist Marty Krystall, who is 
joined in the group by bassist Buell Neidlinger and drummer Peter Erskine. (For 
this Sunday, keyboardist Don Preston will make the trio a quartet.) 
</P>
<P>
Another chamber aspect, says Krystall, is that "we like to play a lot of 
different dynamic levels, from very, very soft to very loud to everything in 
between." 
</P>
<P>
The trio, which has been together (under various names) off-and-on since 1980 
and has just released "Aurora" (Denon), plays "pretty much all original music 
that's from basically a jazz standpoint and reveals such influences as 
Ellington, Coltrane, Ravel, Stravinsky and Rollins," says Krystall. "It's a 
music that takes from the past but that has something else, an edge, that 
people hopefully haven't heard before."

DON MENZA ENSEMBLE SOLIDLY IN THE MAINSTREAM AT ALFONSE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playing with a loose-when-necessary precision and an insistent hard-sock swing, 
saxophonist-composer-arranger Don Menza led his gathered-intermittently big 
band through originals and jazz standards at Alfonse's in North Hollywood 
Monday night, giving the all-seats-taken crowd a solid taste of succulent 
mainstream jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Though Menza's arrangements and orchestrations rarely approach the subtlety and 
scope of works by, say, Bill Holman or Toshiko Akiyoshi, his music does burst 
forth with a joyous, enthusiastic simplicity. On the occasions where he keenly 
employs his ear for blending combinations of brass and reeds, he can concoct 
passages that have a delicate beauty. 
</P>
<P>
The first-set opener, "Take the 'A' Train," began with pianist Tom Garvin's 
gritty, cooking lines and then segued to a melody reading that pitted slurred 
saxes and crisp, biting brass. A fluid solo from the leader led to a too-brief 
outing from trumpeter Chuck Findley, who used thick, chunky notes and 
well-constructed lines in telling a very personal story. 
</P>
<P>
"Groovin' Hard," a Menza warhorse, was perhaps the most typical of the leader's 
oeuvre. This 32-bar tune with a mountain of blues flavor was sparked by a Menza 
solo as well as one by fellow tenorist Larry Covelli, who, while not as 
nimble-fingered as his boss, created some powerful moments. The two then 
engaged in toss-it-back-and-forth passages that sounded as much like 
conversation as they did music. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, trombonist Bill Reichenbach -- on "Groovin' Hard" and a minor blues 
-- demonstrated his prowess as a complex-lined, extremely smooth and 
communicative be-bop stylist, and trumpeter Don Rader delivered a warm, singing 
statement on Mancini's "Moment to Moment." The bullet-train tempo of "Caravan," 
where the leader was right at home and trumpeter Ron King scored, was an ideal 
set closer. Bassist Frank De La Rosa and drummer Bob Leatherbarrow kept the 
home fires burning. 
</P>
<P>
It would be interesting to see Menza's evolution as a composer and orchestrator 
were he to front this ensemble on a much more regular basis. ZAN STEWART

Singer Syd Straw must have a knack for placing herself in challenging 
situations. Three years ago, the loosely constituted group the Golden Palominos 
played to audiences expecting its on-disc stars such as John Lydon and Jack 
Bruce to front the band. Instead, they got Straw, and found it wasn't a bad 
trade at all. Her current debut album "Surprise" finds her musical and lyrical 
vision riding herd over a fat roster of musicians who are known for packing 
their own encompassing visions, including Michael Stipe, John Doe, Van Dyke 
Parks and Richard Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Though confined to a short set before an unacquainted audience when opening for 
Adrian Belew at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Sunday, the willowy, 
pig-tailed singer connected with a set that was nothing short of fearless in 
its mix of powerful, personally felt music and unfettered sense of play. Backed 
by a quartet that included Dave Alvin and X's D.J. Bonebrake, Straw's 
performance was both muscular and cerebral, with songs by such disparate 
sources as Sons of the Pioneers and X coming off as her own fresh possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Straw's lyrics and delivery can seem precious at times -- "Unanswered 
Questions" sounded like an unholy cross between Carly Simon and T Bone Burnett 
-- and on a couple of songs the arrangements seemed half-baked. But those were 
minor flaws compared to Straw's fresh, informed take on popular American music, 
which draws on Stephen Foster rather then David Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Straw and headliner Belew also play two shows at the Roxy tonight. -- JIM 
WASHBURN

SPRAYING SET FOR THURSDAY IN NEW MEDFLY INFESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Aerial spraying of malathion has been scheduled for Thursday night over a 
14-square-mile area north of downtown Los Angeles because of an infestation of 
the crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly, agricultural officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian signed papers declaring a state of emergency to permit 
the spraying as California Conservation Corps members canvassed the 
neighborhood distributing leaflets announcing the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cause of Action 
</P>
<P>
County Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy said he hurriedly drew up an 
eradication plan after a third Medfly was trapped in a lemon tree Sunday, two 
blocks from the Elysian Park location where the first fly was found July 20. 
The second fly was found last Wednesday about a mile and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly poses a danger to the state's multimillion-dollar agricultural 
industry because females lay their eggs in fruits and vegetables, which become 
infested with maggots and become unsalable. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy said his office will use the same battle plan that led to eradication of 
the Medfly earlier this year from West Los Angeles and last year from 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breeding Tactic 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying, expected to last one night, will be followed by the release of 
50 million sterile Medflies. By mating with the sterile male flies, females, in 
effect, breed themselves out of existence. A quarantine also will be imposed, 
prohibiting the removal of home-grown fruit from the area. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy said that details of the eradication effort will be announced at a press 
conference today. Agricultural inspectors, joined by more than 100 members of 
the California Conservation Corps, walked door-to-door Tuesday distributing 
40,000 flyers announcing that spraying will take place from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
Thursday, weather permitting. 
</P>
<P>
The leaflets say, "Malathion is considered one of the safest insecticides in 
use today. For more than 35 years, it has been widely used by home gardeners. 
It is used in many U.S. cities to control mosquitoes and in Europe it is used 
by physicians to treat head lice in children. Health authorities agree that at 
this extreme low dose, pregnant women have no cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
The leaflets tell residents to put their cars in garages or cover them during 
the spraying. A syrupy protein bait that is mixed in with the insecticide could 
damage paint finishes, officials said. Pet dishes should be covered or brought 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood to be sprayed is bounded roughly by Los Feliz Boulevard and 
the Glendale Freeway on the north, 3rd Street on the south, the Harbor and 
Pasadena freeways and San Fernando Road on the east and Western Avenue on the 
west. It includes Echo Park and Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"We will probably not treat Dodger Stadium, even though it is within the area" 
because there are few, if any, fruit trees there, Spaugy said. The Dodgers go 
on the road tonight. 
</P>
<P>
After the third fly was found in the 1600 block of Sargent Place, Spaugy set up 
a conference call Monday between his office in Los Angeles, state agricultural 
officials in Sacramento and Medfly experts in Florida, Hawaii and Guatemala to 
formulate a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
They all agreed, Spaugy said, that "based on finding three Medflies within 
close proximity, we do have an infestation, and the recommendation was that we 
move quickly" to eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy expressed frustration with the rash of agricultural pests in Los Angeles 
County this year. His department is currently battling Oriental fruit fly 
infestations in three parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it's like the law enforcement people trying to get a handle on 
the drug smugglers," he said. "We don't have adequate personnel to plug all of 
the holes in the dike." 
</P>
<P>
"All it takes is one person bringing one piece of fruit from an invested area 
to start an infestation like this one," Spaugy said. Agricultural officials 
doubt that anyone will admit blame for the infestation, considering there is a 
$10,000 fine for bringing in fruit that triggers an infestation. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly gained prominence in California in 1981, when then-Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. was blamed by farmers for aggravating the Medfly crisis in 
Santa Clara County by delaying aerial pesticide spraying. Eventually, the state 
spent $100 million to eradicate the pest, and growers lost an additional $100 
million in sales because of a quarantine.

COUNCIL FAVORS TOUGH ANTI-GRAFFITI LAW; 
</P>
<P>
PROPERTY OWNERS COULD BE PENALIZED FOR NOT HELPING REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Stepping up its battle against graffiti in Los Angeles, the City Council on 
Tuesday tentatively approved a measure providing free removal of the offending 
markings from private property but calling for misdemeanor prosecution of 
uncooperative property owners. 
</P>
<P>
The measure calls for the Department of Building and Safety to issue graffiti 
removal orders. Property owners would be given a choice of removing the 
markings themselves within 15 days or allowing city workers to do it at no 
charge to the owner. 
</P>
<P>
However, refusal to cooperate would make an owner subject to a misdemeanor 
citation, punishable by up to six months in jail, a fine of up to $1,000 or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
The council, obviously frustrated by its many unsuccessful attempts to halt the 
spread of gang graffiti, gave its preliminary approval over the objections of 
Councilman Robert Farrell, who argued that the measure could spark retaliation 
against property owners in the city's gang-ridden neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"In some parts of my district," said Farrell, who represents South-Central Los 
Angeles, "a person would basically be challenged for messing with the graffiti" 
and a homeowner who complied with a city removal order could "wind up maybe 
getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Such an owner might then have a legitimate claim against the city, Farrell 
warned council members. 
</P>
<P>
Eastside Councilwoman Gloria Molina argued that property owners could comply 
with the city order, only to see the graffiti reappear the next day. 
</P>
<P>
But, as reflected in the 11-4 vote, a majority of the council apparently agreed 
with Councilman Marvin Braude, who said, "We are in a crisis. Our society is 
deteriorating. And graffiti is the symbol of that crisis and deterioration. . . 
. We have to take a stand here. . . . If it doesn't work, we'll change it. But 
let's have the courage to try." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs had his own views on graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate graffiti. I just hate it," Wachs said. Then after a pause he added: "If 
I could read what it said, it might not be so bad." 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to take a final vote today. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Bliss, chief of the Building and Safety Department's Bureau of Community 
Safety, said the city is getting the cooperation of most residents in fighting 
graffiti. But under state law, city workers are not allowed to remove graffiti 
on private property without permission. So the ordinance is needed "to put some 
pressure on those not cooperating," Bliss said.

JUDGE RULES AGAINST MAIN DEFENSE CLAIM OF ANTI-ABORTIONISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a setback for anti-abortion activists, a Municipal Court judge ruled Tuesday 
that Operation Rescue leaders cannot attempt to justify their March 25 blockade 
of a women's clinic by claiming that they were preventing "murder." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way it can be shown that abortions were stopped that day," Judge 
Richard A. Paez told Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry and four 
co-defendants, all of whom face trial on misdemeanor counts of trespass and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blocks Use of Defense 
</P>
<P>
Paez's ruling blocked use of the so-called "defense of necessity," which holds 
that laws can be broken in the interest of preventing greater harm, and cleared 
the way for the trial to begin. Jury selection started Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Terry and the four others are the first of 539 anti-abortionists who face 
trial. The charges stem from a sit-in staged at Family Planning Associates on 
Westmoreland Avenue last March in which hundreds of Operation Rescue supporters 
blocked entrances at the clinic in an effort to disrupt services. The 
demonstration, part of a "Holy Week" crusade against abortion, resulted in the 
arrest of about 780 people. 
</P>
<P>
Even if abortions had been prevented that day, Paez said, the law then and now 
is clear: women in California have a right to an abortion during the first 24 
weeks of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules Out Some Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of trespass, of conspiracy to trespass, of obstruction of a 
lawful business," Paez said. He said he would not permit the defense to call as 
witnesses "experts" on whether life starts with conception, nor to display 
photos of fetuses on the counsel table. 
</P>
<P>
Terry reacted angrily to the judge's ruling. Claiming that his defense had been 
"gutted" even before it began, he accused the judiciary of becoming the "lap 
dog of the death industry." 
</P>
<P>
"Can pro-lifers get a fair trial anywhere in this country?" he asked a crowd of 
reporters outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's proceedings were without the placard-waving anti-abortion 
demonstrators who prayed and sang at the Los Angeles County Courthouse on 
Monday. Only a handful of supporters joined Terry on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors from the city attorney's office had asked for Paez's ruling as a 
way to prevent the trial from being turned into an arena of debate over 
abortion. They conceded, however, that the abortion issue will continue to play 
a part in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Paez said he will allow the defendants to explain why they staged the 
demonstration at the clinic, and the defense attorneys said they will 
capitalize on that opening to present their views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll put on a defense of why they were there," said Cyrus Zal, one of the 
defense attorneys. "They'll know what the issue is." 
</P>
<P>
With the necessity-defense issue aside, prosecutors turned to other matters. 
Deputy City Atty. Lara Bloomquist asked the judge to prohibit Zal from praying 
at "strategic moments" in the trial, such as when the prosecution makes its 
arguments, and from prominently displaying a Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Zal objected: "The Bible is my first book of reference, for law and for my 
personal life." 
</P>
<P>
Paez said that while he would not order Zal to put away the Bible, the defense 
attorney will have to refrain from "flashing" it to the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Facing trial with Terry are Jeff White, 31, of Santa Cruz, Andrew Eppink, 41, 
of Palmdale, Donald Bennette, 36, of Mission Viejo and Michael McMonagle, 36, 
of Philadelphia. Terry, 30, of Binghamton, N.Y., is representing himself, as 
are White and McMonagle. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, who earlier pleaded not guilty, are charged with trespassing, 
resisting arrest, blocking a sidewalk, failure to disperse, violating court 
orders and criminal conspiracy. The maximum penalty is $10,000 and one year in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to strengthen their hand, defense attorneys had argued that the 
Family Planning Associates clinic was engaged in unlawful activity, claiming 
that it performs abortions after the 20-week period, in violation of a ban set 
forth in the 1967 California Therapeutic Abortion Act. That law, however, was 
rendered moot by the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on Roe vs. Wade that 
grants a woman's right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The defense then sought to argue that the court's July 7 decision on Webster 
vs. Missouri should be used to revive the California Therapeutic Abortion Act 
because it allows states to ban late-trimester abortions based on the possible 
"viability" of the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
But Paez was not swayed. The Webster ruling has had no impact on California, he 
said, and it would be up to the state Legislature, not the courts, to introduce 
viability as a criterion for abortions. Furthermore, the Operation Rescue 
demonstrations occurred long before the Webster decision was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
The court drama is being played out against the backdrop of what anti-abortion 
activists claim is a resurgence of their crusade. Operation Rescue has 
announced a weeklong series of activities for Los Angeles and Southern 
California, culminating in another demonstration planned for an undisclosed 
clinic on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen anti-abortion protesters on Tuesday gathered at a "funeral" in 
the Odd Fellows Cemetery on Whittier Boulevard. Placed in a child's casket and 
buried in a grave was what spokesmen identified as a 16-week-old aborted fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue also denounced what it described as vandalism at a Long Beach 
church where members have held meetings. Clothes hangers and pro-choice slogans 
had been painted in red on the church's walls. No one has been arrested in 
connection with the vandalism.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER AT CHEVRON CRUSHED TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A maintenance worker at the Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo was crushed to 
death Monday when a 13-ton bundle of steel pipes shifted and pinned him against 
a wall, a refinery spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. McKenna, 26, was treated for massive internal injuries by paramedics 
but was dead on arrival at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center at 8:55 
a.m., according to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna was attaching a rigging from a crane to the bundle of 15-foot pipes 
when it suddenly shifted, said Rod Spackman of Chevron. McKenna was preparing 
the three-foot diameter bundle to be hoisted onto a truck so it could be taken 
to a storage yard. 
</P>
<P>
Spackman said the same procedure is followed dozens of times a year without 
mishap. The state Occupational Safety and Health Administration is 
investigating the accident. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, a Hermosa Beach resident, had worked at the refinery since June. No 
other employee has been killed at the refinery in the last three years, though 
a contract worker died in a truck fire in 1985, Spackman said.

BRADLEY'S BATTLE PLAN ON TRAFFIC CONGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Complied by Times researcher Cecilia Rasmussen 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In June, 1987, Mayor Tom Bradley announced a major program to reduce traffic 
congestion on Los Angeles streets. Here is a progress report on its provisions: 
</P>
<P>
TRUCK BAN 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of all trucks would be banned from surface streets during the peak 
weekday rush hours of 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. Large shippers and receivers 
would be required to operate for at least four hours between off-peak hours. 
The program would be limited to trucks with three axels or more and a gross 
weight of more than 26,000 pounds. A rapid deployment force would also be 
created to remove disabled trucks from the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved by City Council Transportation and Finance and Revenue committees this 
spring; a bill now in state Legislature would preempt city proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ILLEGAL PARKING 
</P>
<P>
Special teams of traffic control officers would impound vehicles illegally 
blocking curb lanes during peak commuting hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted by council August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delivery trucks would be given access to off-street parking to reduce illegal 
street parking during deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implemented administratively; no ordinance needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fines for peak hour "no-stopping" violations would be increased from $28 to 
$53, with illegally parked cars to be towed away half an hour before the rush 
hour starts, at 6:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put into effect by Municipal Court March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREET IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
<P>
Additional personnel would be hired to implement more than 100 traffic 
improvement projects intended to increase capacity and safety by at least 30%; 
among the improvements are additional left-turn pockets, left-turn 
restrictions, reverse traffic lanes, peak-hour lanes and traffic signal timing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted by council May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CITY CREWS

<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted in the 1988-89 budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC NEWS 
</P>

City traffic officers, police and firefighters would relay news of traffic 
troubles to broadcast stations with volunteer help from about 1,000 
radio-equipped Federal Express drivers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted in the city's 1989-90 budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC SIGNALS 
</P>
<P>
A citywide Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control System would be 
implemented in 10 years rather than in the 30 years originally planned; would 
automatically monitor the flow of the 400,000 vehicles that go in and out of 
the downtown area daily, adjust the timing of intersection lights and dispatch 
emergency crews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted by council December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BLOCKED INTERSECTIONS 
</P>
<P>
Drivers would be banned from entering a blocked intersection, even if the light 
is green; violators would be fined $53 for a first offense and up to $500 for 
successive violations. 
</P>

Adopted by council May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SUBSIDY

<P>
Employers in the city that have at least 200 workers would be required to offer 
$15 bus pass subsidies each month if they also provide subsidized parking; 
businesses also would be offered up to $5,000 in transit funds to lease or 
purchase vans for employee van pools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted by council February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TELEPHONE SYSTEM 
</P>

TWO WOMEN NEEDLED BY EXTRA CHARGES AT SAKS SEW UP THEIR CASE 
</P>

Two Orange County women stood outside a Beverly Hills department store Tuesday 
and announced what they called a major victory for American women: Saks Fifth 
Avenue agreed to reduce some clothing alteration charges for women. 
</P>
<P>
Muriel K. Mabry of Anaheim Hills and Lorie Anderson of Mission Viejo said they 
had forced the retailer to reverse "sex discrimination practices" that resulted 
in women being charged more than men for clothing alterations. 
</P>
<P>
Saks officials denied that the chain discriminated against women but confirmed 
that a settlement had been reached with the women. 
</P>
<P>
Legal wrangling over hems, pleats and stitchlines began in June, 1988, after 
Mabry, who owns a career consulting company in Orange County, purchased a $345 
evening dress for a "heavy" date. Over her protests, Mabry paid $41 to have the 
hem and sleeves shortened and a hook and eye added to the front of the dress. 
She believed that the charges were unfair because her male friend did not have 
to pay for alterations to a $500 suit. 
</P>
<P>
About a month later, Anderson, Mabry's friend and co-worker, dished out $1,500 
for an evening gown from Saks to attend a gala Christmas Eve bash at the Four 
Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. But Anderson fumed when the sales clerk told 
her that she would have to pay an extra $40 for alterations. Only a few days 
earlier, she said, her husband had bought a suit and tuxedo and did not have to 
pay "a red cent for extensive alterations." 
</P>
<P>
After exchanging stories, the two women decided that they were ready for a 
legal altercation over the alteration issue and contacted attorney Gloria 
Allred. The attorney filed a class-action suit in Los Angeles Superior Court 
last September charging that Saks violated California's Civil Right Act, which 
prohibits sex discrimination by businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Saks, which has hired an international public relations company to handle the 
national publicity generated by the suit, decided that it was better to settle 
the matter out of court. But officials of the New York-based company insisted 
Tuesday that it was not guilty of sex discrimination, saying it was only a 
"minor misunderstanding." Saks officials said that the chain charged more for 
women's clothing alterations because they involve more complex tailoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Then why did they decide to settle and pay attorney fees? It was more than a 
small misunderstanding," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Patricia Fox, director of fashion and marketing for Saks in Southern 
California: "It's standard to pay the litigant's attorney's fees." 
</P>
<P>
Allred's fees for the case were $24,081. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated settlement last month, two major dry cleaning associations in 
Washington urged their members not to charge more to launder women's clothes. 
The associations' action followed a lawsuit filed against 25 Washington dry 
cleaners and the industry's biggest association -- the International Fabricare 
Institute -- by George Washington University law students. 
</P>
<P>
During a sidewalk news conference in front of Saks' Wilshire Boulevard store, 
Allred pointed to a chart showing that Saks had eliminated or reduced charges 
for some alterations to hems, sleeves and waists. Before the settlement, such 
alternations could have cost up to $18. The change in policy took effect 
Tuesday in Saks' 45 branches nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"These changes will save women millions of dollars and will mend the 
relationship between Saks and American women," Allred declared over traffic 
noise along Wilshire Boulevard. "And I'm giving these stores who continue to 
discriminate against women a 30-day amnesty to clear up discrimination 
policies. . . . If they do not, our law firm or other attorneys will file 
lawsuits against them." 
</P>
<P>
Mabry and Anderson said the new alteration policy would save each of them 
hundreds of dollars a year. "They (Saks) account for three-quarters of my 
wardrobe," said Anderson, who, like Mabry, estimates that she spends $5,000 to 
$10,000 annually at the store. 
</P>
<P>
Mabry, who wore a $350 Christian Dior three-piece suit Tuesday, stood at 
Anderson's side and said, "It's amazing that a Size 2 and a Size 4 can take on 
such a big issue and prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson, "I am proud to have fought for women all over the country." Then 
she stepped in to Saks and purchased a $400 designer outfit.

DOCTOR TESTIFIES FOR DEFENSE IN MCMARTIN TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
3 OF 5 ALLEGED VICTIMS SHOW NO SIGNS OF SEX ABUSE, HE DECLARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A British physician called by the defense in the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation trial testified Tuesday that three of the five alleged victims he 
has been questioned about so far showed no physical signs of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
London city coroner David M. Paul, who also works at the University of London 
Hospital and is a consultant on forensic medicine, said under questioning by 
lawyer Dean Gits that he reviewed medical records and anatomical slides of the 
children but found nothing suggesting molestation in most. 
</P>
<P>
He characterized some slides, projected before the jury, as showing "perfectly 
normal" body parts, and dismissed what appeared to be abnormalities in others 
as "of no significance." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who earlier called six physicians to testify, maintain that 
scarring and other physical signs of prior abuse are present in nine of the 11 
children who have accused Raymond Buckey or his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 
of rape, sodomy, oral copulation and other criminal sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
Paul took issue with the medical findings and even their terminology, and 
testified that the doctors were either mistaken, negligent or inconsistent. He 
also criticized their use of the colposcope, a camera-like machine that takes 
magnified three-dimensional photographs and renders repeated examinations 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be jolly careful when you magnify things up," he said, 
explaining that the process can make many normal objects appear to be abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
Paul said he has examined more than 2,000 children for molestation over the 
last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
While in three cases Paul said he found no evidence consistent with 
molestation, in one other he hedged and in a fifth he testified that the child 
indeed had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the findings of two physicians who examined the 2 1/2-year-old boy 
whose mother's report to Manhattan Beach police triggered the nursery school 
investigation, Paul said: "I don't believe they're even consistent with 
sodomy." He said, however, there were medical signs that could be interpreted 
as evidence that the child had suffered lesser sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Of another alleged victim, a girl who was examined at age 9, Paul said slides 
of her vaginal area reveal "gross abnormalities . . . sufficient to say it is 
diagnostic of child sexual abuse," probably by digital penetration. The girl 
testified earlier that Ray Buckey had inserted his fingers into her at the 
prestigious Manhattan Beach nursery school, and that his mother had touched her 
on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has said from the beginning of the trial -- now in its 28th month 
-- that several of the alleged victims may indeed have been molested, but by 
someone other than the Buckeys. 
</P>
<P>
Refuting extensive medical evidence presented by the prosecution is crucial to 
the defense's case, and Paul is expected to be their last witness before the 
trial enters its rebuttal phase.

By JOHN KENDALL, Kendall covered the trial of Manson and his followers for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After all this time, mention of the Tate-La Bianca case evokes in untold 
thousands the shocking memories of two nights of horror in Los Angeles 20 years 
ago when Manson Family cultists savagely murdered seven people, including 
beautiful, honey-blonde actress Sharon Tate. 
</P>
<P>
Like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the bloody slayings -- 
examined in gruesome detail during the sensational, 9 1/2-month trial of 
Charles Manson and three of his "girls" -- occupy a place in the nation's 
consciousness, although more have died in mass murders since. 
</P>
<P>
On that first night -- warm, muggy Aug. 9, 1969 -- Manson followers Susan 
Atkins, 21; Patricia Krenwinkel, 21, and Charles (Tex) Watson, 23, invaded the 
Benedict Canyon home leased by Tate and her husband, film director Roman 
Polanski, and killed the 27-year-old actress, who was 8 1/2 months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
In a frenzy of shooting and stabbing, they also murdered coffee heiress Abigail 
Folger, 26; her lover, Polish playboy Wojceich Frykowski, 37; hair stylist Jay 
Sebring, 37, and Steven Parent, 18, who had come to visit a caretaker. Polanski 
was out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on Manson's orders again the next night, follower Leslie Van Houten, 20, 
joined Watson and Krenwinkel in the murder of grocery executive Leno La Bianca, 
44, and his wife, Rosemary, 38, in Los Feliz, a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The killers stabbed the seven victims more than 200 times. They wrote "Pig" in 
Tate's blood and "Death to Pigs," "Rise," and "Healter Skelter" in the La 
Biancas' blood. "Sadie" Atkins tasted Tate's blood and said, "To taste death 
and yet give life, wow, what a trip." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, the brutal murders have the power to puzzle those concerned with the 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
Did Manson, who had spent nearly half his life in jail, really expect to 
fulfill his vision of Armageddon -- based on the lyrics of a Beatles song -- by 
starting a black-white race war, as suggested by his prosecutor, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Vincent T. Bugliosi? Or was it satanism, as some have since suggested? 
Or, possibly Manson's own mental illness, as others have speculated? 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew him then say Manson taught that all people are God, Jesus Christ 
and the devil -- part of a whole -- and as such, there is no right, no wrong, 
no good or bad, no barrier to action, and that death, time and pain are only 
concepts. 
</P>
<P>
His followers -- mostly young women -- described life as a daily "magical 
mystery tour," without guilt or shame. But, according to others, life at the 
make-believe world of Spahn Movie Ranch in the Santa Susana Pass, where the 
Manson Family settled in late 1968, wasn't all that magical. 
</P>
<P>
They lived on discarded food collected from supermarket dumpsters. Manson 
handed out LSD, directed group sex and sent his followers to steal, later to 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
Some have seen the murders, coming at the end of the tumultuous 1960s, as the 
culmination of a decade of assassinations, black ghetto riots, war in Vietnam, 
campus protests, seemingly universal challenge of the Establishment in the 
hippie era and general loosening of social restraints. 
</P>
<P>
To retired Superior Court Judge Charles H. Older, 71, who presided at the 
trial, Manson's "twisted philosophy" supplied direction to people without it. 
"That's what made the murders possible: 'There is no wrong, and whatever we do 
is right,' " Older said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Manson and his co-defendants were all sentenced to death, but were spared when 
the state Supreme Court overturned capital punishment, which has since been 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Manson, now 54, and the others have repeatedly sought parole from their life 
prison sentences without success. Whenever they seek freedom, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Stephen R. Kay, 45, who helped convict them, steadfastly opposes their 
release because he thinks they are "very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Kay has appeared at 38 parole hearings, reminding members of the state 
Board of Prison Terms, in graphic detail, of the seven murders that shocked the 
nation two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They are in prison for committing horrible murders to start a race war and 
destroy our society," Kay said this week. "I don't think they should be given 
another chance to destroy society."

RHODE ISLAND ACCEPTS COVEN AS CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coven of witches has won tax exempt status in Rhode Island as a legitimate 
religious group. "With this ruling, we witches will definitely be able to come 
out of the closet and take our place in society," said the coven's high 
priestess, Joyce Siegrist, also known as Lady Genevieve. Tax Administrator R. 
Gary Clark said he overturned the state's initial ruling that the Rosegate 
Coven did not qualify for a sales tax exemption, because it proved on appeal 
that it met the guidelines for legitimate church groups as set out by a 1986 
Rhode Island Supreme Court ruling. The coven, also known as Our Lady of the 
Roses Wiccan Church, has 30 to 40 members and meets about three times a month 
for rituals, Siegrist said. The core of the Wiccan worship is belief in a deity 
with male and female attributes, whose psychic energy can be tapped. Under 
state laws, a religion must be a nonprofit group, not set up to avoid taxes. It 
must have a litany or system of prayer, and specific doctrines and practices.

The National Wildlife Federation asked a federal judge to force the Commerce 
Department to require Gulf Coast shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle 
excluder devices. The department's temporary new regulations limiting trawl 
times do not protect endangered sea turtles as the department claims, the 
federation argued. The federation said it has learned that Commerce Secretary 
Robert A. Mosbacher has data from National Marine Fisheries Service scientists 
that demonstrates the mortality rate from a 105-minute tow time is more than 
four times greater than what the secretary has admitted. Mosbacher decided July 
24 to suspend requirements for excluder devices after Texas and Louisiana 
shrimpers protested their use by blockading Gulf Coast shipping channels.

A man testified in Maryville, Tenn., that he would feel "raped of my 
reproductive rights" if his wife wins control of seven frozen embryos in an 
unprecedented divorce case. "I'm not asking that they be destroyed," Junior 
Lewis Davis, 30, said. "I'm just asking that they not be inserted in Mary or 
any other donor." Mary Sue Davis, 28, who followed her husband to the stand, 
said: "I am the mother of those embryos. To me, they are already fertilized and 
they are the beginnings of life. I have an attachment to them." Mrs. Davis 
contends she should be given control of the seven fertilized eggs she and her 
husband produced at a Knoxville hospital. Her husband has asked the court to 
prevent her or anyone else from using the eggs without his consent. Davis also 
said his upbringing in a boys' home made him object strongly to bringing a 
child into a single-parent home. After the couple testified, Blount County 
Circuit Court Judge W. Dale Young recessed the trial until Thursday.

LELAND PLANE STILL MISSING

Ethiopian police and farmers with flashlights searched a remote mountain area 
overnight for the missing plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and 13 
other people. A daylong aerial search was suspended at dusk and will be resumed 
today. The Twin Otter aircraft disappeared Monday on its way from Addis Ababa 
to the Fugnido refugee camp near the border with Sudan, about 300 miles to the 
west. Leland, 44, has taken a keen interest in Africa's refugee problem. 
President Bush, saying Leland was on his sixth humanitarian mission in that 
part of the world, promised that his Administration will do all it can to help 
find the missing plane with Leland, eight other Americans and five Ethiopians.

An Afghan rebel rocket hit the largest military ammunition dump in Kabul, 
wounding at least five people and setting off explosions that rocked the city 
for hours. An official with the official Bakhtar news agency said the rocket 
hit the Khair Khana munitions depot, about half a mile from Kabul's airport, 
sending up towering flames that were visible miles away. The U.S.-backed rebels 
have been pounding Kabul with rockets from their positions in surrounding 
mountains for more than a month.

Vietnamese "boat people" arriving at a refugee camp in Malaysia said pirates 
had attacked their craft, raping 15 women and throwing others overboard. At 
least 71 people were feared dead. The 13 survivors told U.N. refugee officials 
on the island of Bidong that they fled Vietnam in a group of 84 but were 
attacked by pirates in two fishing boats as they headed for Malaysian waters 
late Saturday. Workers on an oil platform off the Malaysian coast rescued three 
survivors and fishermen picked up the other 10. U.N. statistics show more than 
70 refugee boats have been attacked by pirates since January, 1988, with more 
than 400 refugees either missing or presumed dead.

U.S. soldiers detained 29 Panamanians who entered a restricted military area 
and released them after confiscating their weapons, a spokeswoman for the U.S. 
Southern Command in Panama reported. She said that among those briefly detained 
were 10 officers and soldiers of the Panamanian Defense Forces, including Maj. 
Manuel Sieiro, brother-in-law of Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega. Five 
Panamanian journalists were among the civilians in the group, the spokeswoman 
added. About 40 U.S. Marines were conducting "a reconnaissance exercise on 
roads" leading to the Panama Canal when the Panamanians entered the area in 15 
vehicles. A number of submachine guns, rifles and pistols were confiscated, the 
spokeswoman said.

Japan has a new prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, whose first statement about the 
United States Tuesday was the kind of thing you'd say about a barely endured 
brother-in-law. "Whether Japan likes it or not, the U.S.-Japan relationship is 
precious," said Kaifu, perhaps revealing more than he meant to of current 
Japanese attitudes about America. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling is mutual on this side of the Pacific. Respondents to recent polls 
by both Gallup and Harris said Japan's economic power poses a more serious 
threat to the United States than the military power of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are suffering delusions. Americans told Gallup that they thought 
Japan is already the world's leading economic power -- which it isn't now and 
may never be -- and that they feared its capital buying up U.S. companies, 
dictating the American future. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile some Japanese, seemingly drunk on the strong yen, have been sounding 
off. "You know what Japanese leaders really think of Americans," a Japanese 
government official confided recently. "They think the upper classes want to 
become doctors and lawyers and make lots of money and the rest want to go on 
vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly a little factual analysis is in order to see what the situation really 
is. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is Japan's economic power, and the value of its yen, may be closer to 
a peak and a long-term leveling out than a continued up-trend. Predictions of 
Japanese billions buying up the world are misplaced and overblown. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, America has to get its economic house in order -- and 
Japanese pressure, verbal and otherwise, may actually be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's economy -- which totals close to $3 trillion in gross national product, 
compared to more than $5 trillion for the United States -- is impressive these 
days because it's like a man with money in the bank. Last year, Japan ran a 
$79-billion current account surplus -- the broadest measure of its trade in 
goods and services. Its economy has abundant capital available because the 
Japanese people save 16% to 17% of their income -- down from 20% in former 
years but still more than treble the United States' 5.3% savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the U.S. economy, with low savings and big deficits in trade and 
its government budget, is overdrawn at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But if the United States has been overspending, Japan has been underspending. 
Japan's determined 40-year industrial drive hasn't merely held back luxuries 
from its people, it has held back basic amenities; 40% of Japanese housing is 
not connected to sewage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voting Socialist 
</P>
<P>
But now the people are demanding a payoff for their sacrifices and things are 
changing. That's the reason for the political turmoil that has brought in the 
third prime minister in three months. 
</P>
<P>
Great numbers of Japanese are voting Socialist, not because they believe in 
Karl Marx, but because they want to change their society. They'd like better 
housing, and a government that will pay attention to the needs of growing 
numbers of elderly in Japan's population. 
</P>
<P>
What it all means is that Japanese domestic spending will increase, reducing 
the savings surplus and drawing in imports -- which will reduce the current 
account surplus. Indeed, that is already happening, as Japan's imports from 
other countries in Asia are increasing -- and its surplus so far this year is 
running roughly one-third below last year's level. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook is that over time Japan's economy will more closely resemble 
America's. It will rely more on consumer spending, and spend more on defense. 
Its companies will invest more outside Japan -- as they are already doing. Last 
year, Japanese firms invested $18 billion in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, 
Thailand and other Asian countries -- almost double the $10 billion it invested 
in plant and equipment in the United States. (Such permanent investment is 
different from the $50 billion and more that Japan has been investing in U.S. 
Treasury bonds, helping to fund the government's deficit). 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese economy, in short, is changing. And most of its changes, the 
increased consumer spending and defense outlays, the imports from and 
investments in other Asian countries result in whole or in part from U.S. 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
But now it's America's turn to change, and Japan is applying the pressure -- 
frequently threatening to cease funding the U.S. deficit, bluntly telling 
America to spend less and save more. Those who fear Japan's industrial 
investment are missing the mark, says Peter Rona, an American banker who is 
president of IBJ Schroder, the New York-based investment arm of the Industrial 
Bank of Japan. "Japanese investment in U.S. industry and real estate will phase 
out after a few more years," as changing interest and currency exchange rates 
make it less economic, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The real pressure for change will come as Japan's diminishing capital surplus 
will no longer be available to fund U.S. deficits. Then either U.S. savings 
will have to increase, or U.S. taxes will. 
</P>
<P>
If Americans still have pride, savings will be the better bet. Sure, today's 
haughty Japanese criticism is annoying. But many Americans recognize also that 
it hits home, that a lot of things in the U.S. economy have gone astray lately, 
and putting them right shapes up as the challenge of the 1990s. Some times your 
harshest critics are your best friends.

Yields Fall on Treasury Notes: Yields on three-year Treasury notes fell to the 
lowest level in 18 months as the government began a series of huge debt 
auctions intended to raise $44.5 billion this week. The average yield was 
7.93%, down from 9.12% at the last auction on May 9. It was the lowest rate 
since three-year notes averaged 7.42% on Feb. 2, 1988. The notes will carry a 
coupon interest rate of 7.875%, with each $10,000 in face value selling for 
$9,985.60.

AMPCO-PITTSBURGH ACQUIRES STAKE IN MIDWAY AIRLINES

<TEXT>
<P>
Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., an engineering company, said Tuesday that it has 
acquired a 6.6% stake in Midway Airlines Inc. with the possible view toward 
acquiring it, a move that could spark a bidding war for the regional airline. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh-based Ampco, which has recently undergone a major streamlining, said 
it currently has no plans to acquire Chicago-based Midway, but that it may be 
interested in some type of merger. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the announcement may spur other interested parties to come 
forward as well. "Midway is in play. Who knows what will happen if the right 
offer comes along?" Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott 
Inc., said. 
</P>
<P>
The price of Midway stock rose $1.50 a share to close at $20.50 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Midway Airlines said in a statement that Ampco-Pittsburgh had not contacted it 
in connection with the investment. 
</P>
<P>
But it said it was aware that Ampco had notified the Securities and Exchange 
Commission of the stock purchases, which were made between July 25 and Aug. 3 
at prices ranging from $14.625 to $18 a share.

UAL MAY DRAW MANY SUITORS IF DAVIS SPURNED; 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT BASS, PAN AM, TWA SAID TO BE IN WINGS 
</P>

<P>
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, could trigger a takeover battle today 
if it rejects a buyout offer from Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential bidders said to be eyeing the airline are Texas billionaire 
Robert M. Bass, New York investor Saul P. Steinberg, the Pan Am Corp. and Trans 
World Airlines Inc., which is owned by New York investor Carl C. Icahn. It was 
also speculated that UAL's management might try to finance its own buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The president of United's flight attendants' union said the 13,000-member group 
might be receptive to a management buyout, despite the fact that there have 
been nearly two years of difficult contract talks with little progress. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important issue to us is job security," said Patricia Friend, 
president of the Assn. of Flight Attendants at United. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$250 a Share Predicted 
</P>
<P>
The board of Chicago-based UAL is scheduled to consider Davis' bid for the 
airline at a meeting today. Though details of Davis' proposal have not been 
disclosed, it is said to be well over $200 a share, or about $4.32 billion. 
UAL, which on Monday characterized Davis' bid as "highly conditional," is 
expected to reject the offer. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's stock price, which soared $46.25 Monday, continued to rise Tuesday, 
closing at $219.25, up $8.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Analysts said bidding for the airline company could go as high as $250 a share. 
The stock has sold for as little as $86.50 during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect additional bids, either from outside investors, or from inside the 
company in the form of a management buyout, or from another airline," said 
Louis A. Marckesano, an airline industry analyst with the Janney Montgomery 
Scott investment firm in Philadelphia. Marckesano said Pan Am, the parent of 
Pan American World Airways, was the most logical airline bidder for UAL. 
</P>
<P>
Money-losing Pan Am, with the support of two New York investment banks and a 
Texas partnership that included billionaire brothers Sid and Lee Bass, made an 
unsuccessful bid for NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, earlier this 
year. Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett has said that the airline must find a 
partner to survive in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Think Big' 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts say United would fit well with Pan Am. Though United 
has an impressive domestic route system, as well as a network of Pacific basin 
flights, it lacks European routes. Pan Am, on the other hand, serves many 
points in Europe, but has an insignificant domestic route system. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in a June interview whether he might consider buying United, Plaskett 
told The Times, "You have to think big." 
</P>
<P>
One possible stumbling block for Pan Am is that United would be more expensive 
than Northwest, which was acquired by Los Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi 
for $3.35 billion. But Marckesano said, "They put together a bid for Northwest. 
I think they could put together a similar type bid for United." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said TWA also might consider a bid for United. Contract talks with its 
machinists' union were suspended last week after TWA announced that a corporate 
change as the result of a merger or combination with another airline was 
possible. But several observers said a TWA merger with United is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Benteman, a Kansas City analyst who puts out a newsletter called Wealth 
Monitors, said his sources indicate that TWA's chairman, Icahn, owns no UAL 
stock. Though TWA needs aircraft to expand its fleet, a UAL acquisition is 
probably too large for Icahn, Benteman said. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington lawyer, who specializes in regulatory matters involving airlines, 
said a merger between TWA and United would raise antitrust questions. "There is 
much more overlap domestically between TWA and United than there is between Pan 
Am and United," he said. "I think the Justice Department would look very 
closely at the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
Observers said Steinberg, a close friend of UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, is 
not likely to make a serious effort to win control of the company. Steinberg, 
who owns 6.9% of UAL, is more likely to sell his stock and take a profit, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Benteman said Robert Bass, whose investments include American Savings &amp; 
Loan, also might bid for UAL. Bass, brother of Sid and Lee Bass, is rumored to 
own between 2% and 3% of the airline company's shares. "He likes to buy into 
companies with good management and undervalued assets. . . . I imagine he's 
involved in United," Benteman said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that Bass, too, will not be drawn into a bidding war. "If he can't 
get a company on the cheap, he'll let someone else buy it."

Guess Owners Sue Jordache Agents: The Marciano brothers, owners of Guess Inc., 
filed suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles charging that representatives 
of the Nakash brothers, who own rival Jordache Enterprises, conspired, among 
other things, to plant false information about criminal activity by the 
Marcianos with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The suit, which 
seeks more than $90 million in damages, alleges that Octavio Pena, president of 
a security firm called Lynch International, and Sally Godfrey, a Nebraska 
lawyer who posed as a free-lance writer under another name, were promised a 
$1-million bonus from Jordache if they succeeded in persuading the Marcianos to 
settle. The suit also names Robert Spiegelman, a Jordache attorney. Pena said 
in a telephone interview that the allegations were false; others named in the 
suit could not be reached.

SOLVANG OLIVE COMPANY BRANCHES OUT; 
</P>
<P>
FROM ITS HUMBLE START IN A GARAGE, THE FIRM NOW SELLS ITS GOODS WORLDWIDE. 
</P>

<P>
The company was started in a one-car garage in Santa Barbara six years ago. 
Now, the olives it produces are sold in all 50 states and in several foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Jars of the 37 different kinds of spiced and stuffed olives produced by the 
Santa Barbara Olive Co. are found in gourmet shops, supermarkets and 
restaurants coast to coast -- as well as in stores such as Neiman Marcus, 
Macy's and Harrods in London. 
</P>
<P>
The specialty food company, owned and operated by Craig Makela, 33, and his 
wife, Cindy, 31, in this quaint Danish town in Santa Barbara County, is a 
remarkable success story. It had $48,000 in gross sales its first year in 
production in 1983 and $1.3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Makela proudly proclaims his California heritage -- and his sense of 
humor -- on the label of every jar of olives he sells: "Santa Barbara Olive 
Company. Owned and operated by a 5th generation Santa Barbara family. To your 
health from olive us to olive you. The Makelas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fans in High Places 
</P>
<P>
He is president of the expanding company, and his wife is vice president. 
"Craig gets the products made," said Cindy Makela. "I get them sold." 
</P>
<P>
A letter from former President Ronald Reagan praising the company's olive and 
olive oil hangs on a wall in the firm's retail outlet on Solvang's main street. 
The company's offices are on the second floor of the 80-year-old building, 
which is called the Olive House. 
</P>
<P>
"President Reagan gave many Santa Barbara Olive Co. gift packages to friends 
and visiting dignitaries while in the White House, always mentioning the olives 
came from a place just over the hill from his ranch," Craig Makela said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Callahan started the company in his garage in 1982 and spent nearly a 
year in research and development before he produced anything. Then he came out 
with six different kinds of olives -- garlic, country, California black, 
Mexican, hickory smoked and Sicilian. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working for the Santa Barbara Winery at the time and helped Larry as a 
consultant," Craig Makela recalled. "Larry was a foodie. He wanted to come up 
with something not on the market. He sold his olives to specialty shops in 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"He was independently wealthy. He decided to teach aerobics to octogenarians 
and asked me if I would be interested in buying him out for $30,000 in July, 
1984. I did. I gave him $15,000 down and made three subsequent payments of 
$5,000 each with 10% interest. The company consisted of a box full of labels, a 
dolly, miscellaneous jars and things, a labeling machine and a truck." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Always Brainstorming' 
</P>
<P>
1984 was a good year for Makela: He moved the company out of Callahan's one-car 
garage into his own two-car garage in Santa Barbara, and he married Cindy that 
November. 
</P>
<P>
They moved their operation to Solvang in 1986 and now own eight acres of olives 
in the Santa Ynez Valley. They also buy olives from 30 independent California 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
They have a processing plant in Los Angeles and a warehouse in Buellton. Their 
products -- which also include seed and nut oils, vinegar, pickles, mustards 
and capers -- are sold in Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada and 
are being introduced this month in the United Arab Emirates on the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always brainstorming, trying to come up with new ideas for new product 
lines," Cindy Makela said. "Craig and I both carry tape recorders with us all 
the time so we don't lose any ideas that happen to pop into our heads." 
</P>
<P>
One of their latest products is a skin moisturizer made of olive oil. "We sell 
our olive oil in Japan," Cindy Makela said. "Instead of putting it on the food 
shelves, they placed it in the cosmetic department. It was an instant hit. Now 
we sell a Santa Barbara Olive Co. olive oil moisturizer with a natural 
fragrance that doesn't have the olive oil smell."

Stock prices climbed again Tuesday to another post-crash high as the Dow Jones 
industrial index finished just under the 2,700 mark in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index of 30 industrials rose 4.18 points to 2,699.17, just 23.25 points 
short of the record closing high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The slight increase followed a surge of 41.54 points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After rising well above 2,700, the Dow retreated broadly in an afternoon 
selloff that analysts termed a normal and measured reaction to the run-up a day 
earlier. The market regained some ground in the last 30 minutes of trading. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was healthy we held yesterday's gains without a back-off, 
particularly when you're near a psychological level," said Edward P. Nicoski, a 
technical analyst with Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no panic selling even though we've been near this level," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index's flirtation with the 2,700 level has resurrected fears from two 
years ago, when the market's historic highs reached in August were shattered 
two months later in the worst crash in history. The Black Monday panic of Oct. 
19, 1987, has made many investors cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Good performances among select blue chip stocks and takeover-related news in 
the airline industry paced Tuesday's gains. 
</P>
<P>
UAL rose 8 1/2 to 219 1/4 after soaring 46 1/2 Monday, when the company 
disclosed it received a buyout offer from investor Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The strength trickled over to other airlines, with AMR up 2 3/8 to 73 5/8, 
Delta gaining 2 1/4 to 76 3/4 and Pan Am up 1/4 to 4 1/4 in heavy trading. 
Midway jumped 1 1/2 to 20 1/2 after Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. disclosed it had 
acquired a 6.6% stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 834 up, 688 down and 496 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 200.34 million shares, up from 169.75 million in the 
previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 237.89 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks rebounded to close higher for the first time in four trading days. 
The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues rose 129.10 to close at 34,759.48. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended higher on London's Stock Exchange. The Financial Times-Stock 
Exchange 100-share index ended up 6.6 at 2,348.1. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished mixed as the Treasury completed the first part of its 
quarterly securities auction and traders braced for more episodes in this 
week's $44.5-billion borrowing binge. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 1/8 point, or about $1.25 for every 
$1,000 in face value, while its yield stayed at about 8.08%. But some 
shorter-term Treasury issues edged higher and corporate and tax-exempt issues 
posted some tiny gains. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said many traders were standing aside to see how the Treasury's sale 
of new securities goes this week. 
</P>
<P>
In the first leg of its three-part auction to refinance debt, the Treasury sold 
$10 billion in three-year notes for an average yield of 7.93%. 
</P>
<P>
That was the lowest level for an auction of three-year notes since they were 
sold at an average yield of 7.42% on Feb. 2, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.9375%, up from 8.875% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar drifted lower against all major foreign currencies in listless 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices firmed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery rose to $366.20 an ounce from $365.90 late Monday. Republic 
National Bank of New York said the late bid for gold was $365.70, up 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said profit taking following a moderate advance on Monday 
helped push the dollar lower, but trading was light in the absence of any 
market-moving news and because many traders were on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 0.53 Japanese yen to a closing 139.25 yen. It fell to 138.75 yen in 
London, and to 138.86 yen in New York, down from 140.05. 
</P>
<P>
In London, it cost $1.6250 to buy one British pound, compared to $1.6075 late 
Monday. Sterling fetched $1.6255 in New York, up from $1.5980. 
</P>
<P>
Gold traded late in London at $365.45 an ounce, down 30 cents from Monday. In 
Zurich , Switzerland, the late bid was $365.85, up from $365.40. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.18 to close at $367.28. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current 
delivery rose to $5.156 an ounce from $5.128. But silver fell in London to 
$5.16 from $5.18. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Cotton futures prices made an abrupt about-face, surging to the upper reaches 
of the daily trading limit after falling nearly their daily limit in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, soybeans suffered big losses after a wave of selling near the 
close, and crude oil futures broke back above the $18-a-barrel plateau. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp price swings in cotton appeared to reflect uncertainty about the size 
and quality of the crop in advance of an Agriculture Department crop production 
report due out this week. 
</P>
<P>
Traders speculated that extremely dry conditions in Texas may have lowered the 
yield there, while unusually wet weather throughout the growing areas of the 
Delta during the spring and summer is believed to have adversely affected much 
of the crop there. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton settled 1.86 cents to the limit -- up 2 cents higher on the New York 
Cotton Exchange, with the contract for delivery in October at 74.80 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures prices eased slightly, but soybean prices absorbed a more direct 
hit on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 3.5 cents lower to unchanged, with September at $3.915 a bushel; 
corn was 1.25 cents lower to 0.5 cent higher, with September at $2.2425 a 
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 1.5 cents lower, with September at $1.36 a bushel, 
and soybeans were 9 cents to 18 cents lower, with August at $5.925 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures, at $20 a barrel three weeks ago, had been trending downward 
since. But the price climbed above $18 and held the line Tuesday at the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, pulling the products along. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd call $18 more a psychological support level than anything else, but the 
trade tends to rally on round numbers," said Jim Ritterbusch of Carson 
Petroleum Co., Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock futures were mixed, but pork futures were mostly lower on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Precious metal futures finished mostly higher in the wake of a weakening U.S. 
dollar.

HILTON SHARES GAIN ON BUYOUT REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shares of Hilton Hotels Corp. rose Tuesday on a published report that the 
company's directors would review takeover bids later this week, but industry 
analysts were quick to discount the claims. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, Hilton shares traded as high as $109.675 before 
closing at $107.675, up $1.125. About 615,000 shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton officials were not available for comment on the report, which was 
published in Tuesday's editions of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts said the Beverly Hills-based hotel chain would probably 
wait for reports from its financial advisers, Shearson Lehman Hutton and 
Eastdil Realty, before reviewing any bids. Also, serious suitors usually look 
at those reports before making any offers, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very possible that somebody came in with an expression of interest," 
said analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But the "normal process is 
to first put together these books of data (the financial reports) for potential 
bidders."

CHIEF U.S. COFFEE NEGOTIATOR REPLACED; NO POLICY SHIFT SEEN

<P>
The chief U.S. coffee negotiator, Jon Rosenbaum, has been replaced, but the 
move does not signal a shift in U.S. coffee policy, officials at the Trade 
Representative's Office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum's departure is considered important because he took a high-profile 
approach to his job, provoking the wrath of some coffee producers for his 
outspoken ways and perceived hard-line positions. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Virgilio Barco, for example, last month blamed the 
"intransigent position" of the United States for the collapse of the coffee 
price-support system. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum has headed U.S. efforts to overhaul the export quota accord that 
until last month governed world coffee trade and helped prop up prices. 
</P>
<P>
The breakup of the 74-nation coffee pact on July 3 threw markets into chaos and 
sent prices plummeting. Coffee provides important export earnings for a large 
number of developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

BUSH SAYS HE'S READY FOR 'MAXIMUM' IRAN DIALOGUE; 
</P>
<P>
EFFORT ON HOSTAGES INTENSIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration sent a clear signal to Iran today that the United 
States wants to encourage "maximum dialogue" on the American hostages in 
Lebanon despite the Administration's publicly stated policy of refusing to get 
involved in "trading off or negotiating for hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Although insisting that Administration policy has not changed, President Bush 
said: "I hope I am open-minded enough to talk and to exercise every diplomatic 
channel I can to free these Americans. And no American is going to be content 
until these Americans are free." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Remains Unchanged 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview with The Times, White House press secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater insisted that Administration policy remains unchanged. But Fitzwater 
said Bush was interpreting the policy in a way that should make clear to the 
Iranians that the United States wants to establish clear lines of communication 
through an intermediary to facilitate a dialogue on the hostage issue. 
</P>
<P>
"You can say it's a signal to Iran, and we clearly want to encourage maximum 
dialogue," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the Administration hopes that the election last week of Hashemi 
Rafsanjani as Iran's new president means a change of attitude on the part of 
the Iranian government. "Our policies haven't changed," he said, "but we want 
to state them in a way that maximizes the opportunity for dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New 'Definition' 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has made several statements reflecting what Fitzwater called 
a new "definition" of that policy, beginning with a comment by Bush in an 
interview that appeared in Wednesday's Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had forsaken the policy of not negotiating for the release of 
hostages, Bush said he has no problem saying that "if I can talk to somebody 
and get the release of an American hostage and do it without, in my view and in 
the view of the experts, putting others at risk, I'd be glad to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior intelligence source said that "a lot of very delicate 
things are going on" in negotiations with Iran through third countries to try 
to seek the release of the eight American hostages being held by terrorists in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Algeria Plays Role 
</P>
<P>
Algeria, which has played a major role in negotiating the release of hostages 
in several other cases, including when a TWA jetliner was hijacked by Shiite 
Muslim extremists in the summer of 1985, has emerged as a prominent 
intermediary in current negotiations, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Jordan also are operating as 
intermediaries in U.S. contacts with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, during a brief question-and-answer session with reporters in the Oval 
Office, promised to pursue every diplomatic channel in seeking release of the 
hostages, whom he described as "too precious for me to be sticking my head in 
the sand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort Energized 
</P>
<P>
The videotape released by terrorists that showed the body an American hostage 
-- Lt. Col. William Higgins -- hanging from a rope has energized the effort to 
free the hostages, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a common threat. This is too much. Enough is enough," Bush declared.

PRO-CHOICE GOP CANDIDATE HOLDS LEAD IN 76TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT VOTE 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only pro-choice candidate in a field of six Republicans held a 212-vote 
lead today with 700 absentee ballots yet to be counted in a special primary 
election to fill an Assembly seat in a conservative Southern California 
district. 
</P>
<P>
If Tricia Hunter, a registered nurse from Bonita, holds onto her lead after the 
absentee ballots are counted, she will face pro-choice Democrat Jeannine 
Correia of Poway in an Oct. 3 runoff in the heavily Republican 76th District 
that covers arid sections of San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign attracted national attention as the first test of strength for 
pro-choice and anti-abortion forces since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling July 3 
giving state legislatures more power to regulate abortion.

ANAHEIM DRIVER HELD IN COLLISION

<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old woman is being held on charges of driving under the influence, 
reckless driving and evading police today after a car she was driving rammed 
into a compact packed with eight people Tuesday night after a short police 
chase along Brookhurst Road. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Josephine Mendoza of Anaheim is in fair condition at Western Medical 
Center in Santa Ana, Fullerton Police Sgt. Steve Matson said. 
</P>
<P>
A red car was spotted racing out of a service station at La Palma Avenue and 
Brookhurst in Anaheim with wheels spewing smoke in an "exhibition of speed," 
Anaheim Police Sgt. Ken Brott said. An officer gave chase but the driver failed 
to stop, Brott said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer then radioed for help, and an Anaheim police helicopter and later 
Fullerton police cars assisted, Brott said. 
</P>
<P>
The six-minute chase at speeds of up to 80 m.p.h ended at the northeast corner 
of Commonwealth Avenue and Brookhurst in Fullerton when the car went through a 
red light and collided with another car, Matson said. The collision sent both 
cars slamming into light poles. Eight occupants of the car that was hit, 
including five children ranging from 3 to 12 years old, were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the names of the others, who were in stable to fair 
condition today at four area hospitals.

PANAMA SEIZES U.S. SOLDIERS AT FORT;

AMERICANS REACT BY BLOCKING ENTRANCE TO NORIEGA OFFICES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Panamanian military authorities arrested American soldiers at Ft. Amador today, 
and U.S. troops then blocked the entrance to the area where Gen. Manuel Antonio 
Noriega has offices. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Ronald Sconyers, spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, refused to give 
any details of the arrests, saying only that a "plural number" of U.S. military 
personnel were detained in the Ft. Amador area. 
</P>
<P>
The action was in apparent retaliation for the detention by U.S. authorities of 
29 Panamanians, including nine military personnel, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Amador is a joint-use area that includes barracks for Panamanian troops, a 
building where Noriega has an office, several Southern Command offices, a U.S. 
naval station and a golf course and clubs used by U.S. personnel. 
</P>
<P>
After the U.S. soldiers were arrested, four U.S. armored personnel carriers 
blocked the entrance, and witnesses said several Panamanians were arrested. 
Civilians were allowed to come and go, but Panamanian military personnel were 
refused entry. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Noriega, the de facto leader of Panama and commander of the 
Panamanian Defense Forces, was not at his office in Ft. Amador today. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Command sent a message asking Panamanian military authorities to 
come to the entrance, said the sources, who demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Blocking the entrance delayed a Panamanian anti-terrorist unit from holding an 
exercise at the National Bank of Panama, a 15-story building in Panama City. 
The unit was unable to take trucks and other equipment out of Ft. Amador. 
</P>
<P>
A few dozen troops from the two countries lined a street that divides nearby 
Quarry Heights, where Southern Command headquarters is located, from Panama 
City. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Command said the 29 Panamanians were detained for one hour and 15 
minutes Tuesday because they entered a joint-use military area without 
authorization. The group included four military officers, one of them Maj. 
Manuel Sieiro, Noriega's brother-in-law.

<P>
Sporadic power outages left about 2,400 utility customers in hillside areas of 
Studio City and Hollywood without electricity early today, the Department of 
Water and Power said. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown problem in an underground line began disrupting power from a 
distribution station in the 8700 block of Mulholland Drive on Tuesday evening, 
DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen said. The problem was repaired by 7:45 a.m. 
today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The area affected by the outages in Studio City was north of Mulholland between 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Woodrow Wilson Drive in neighborhoods south of 
Ventura Boulevard, Jensen said. On the other side of the hill, the outages 
spread as far as West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Some areas lost electricity for as little as two minutes while other utility 
customers had intermittent outages from four to five hours.

Dashing U.S. hopes, new Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer today said there will be 
no change under his administration in the nation's anti-nuclear stance, which 
led to U.S. warships being banned from New Zealand's ports. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer also said his administration will be "less exciting" than that of his 
predecessor, David Lange, who resigned Monday for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, a 47-year-old lawyer, said he pales in comparison to the colorful 
Lange, who for five years captured world attention by disputing with the United 
States and France over nuclear issues. But he promised to pursue the Lange 
vision of an independent New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The United States welcomed Palmer's appointment, noting that he had spent 
considerable time in the United States as an academic, and some officials 
privately expressed hope that the nation's anti-nuclear policy would be 
altered.

A Jewish settler mistook soldiers in the occupied West Bank for Palestinians 
about to attack and fired on the troops, provoking return fire that killed his 
infant son, the army said today. 
</P>
<P>
Itai Hamtzani, 19 months, was shot in the head and died at Tel Hashomer 
Hospital in Tel Aviv. The army said the soldiers opened fire when the father, 
Daniel Hamtzani, 30, stopped his car Tuesday night and shot into a grove of 
trees at an army patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The father was shot in the chest and slightly wounded, and a second son, Ordan, 
4, was slightly wounded, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred while Hamtzani was traveling to his home in the 
settlement of Ariel. About 70,000 Jewish settlers live among 1.7 million 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

COLLEGE FEE HIKES MODERATING

The decade-long surge in college costs is moderating slightly this fall with 
average tuitions heading just 5% to 9% higher, according to a College Board 
survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
Total annual costs at the priciest private schools will exceed $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the annual survey had welcome news for at least some beleaguered 
students and parents: Tuition and fees at two-year public colleges will rise an 
average of 5% to $842, a bit under the current 5.9% rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
That is a rarity in a decade in which college costs have consistently exceeded 
the nation's overall inflation rate -- a fact that has led critics like former 
U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett to sharply question college 
management. 
</P>
<P>
At their worst, costs at both public and private institutions rose in double 
digits from 1981 through 1984. Rates at four-year public colleges shot up 20% 
in 1983-84 before beginning to level off.

BOSS CALLED TO FACE COURT FOR POLLUTION;

<P>
PENNWALT EXECUTIVE FORCED BY JUDGE TO APPEAR, ENTER PLEA

<P>
The chief executive of the Pennwalt Corp., making an extraordinary court 
appearance at a judge's demand, entered a guilty plea on his company's behalf 
today to charges of polluting a waterway in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin E. Tuttle, Pennwalt chief executive and chairman, assured U.S. District 
Judge Jack Tanner that the chemical company will do all it can to avoid another 
toxic spill. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and legal experts have said Tanner, by requiring Tuttle to 
appear in person, could set a precedent for punishing corporate negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Pennwalt grew out of the spill of at least 75,000 gallons 
of bleach into a waterway opening onto Puget Sound. The bleach, sodium 
dichromate, contained hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.1-Million Fine 
</P>
<P>
In May, Pennwalt agreed to pay a $1.1-million fine and to plead guilty to five 
misdemeanor counts after criminal charges against four company officials, 
including three executives, were dropped. Tuttle was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, however, Tanner refused to accept guilty pleas from attorneys and 
lower-ranking executives of the Philadelphia-based company, demanding instead 
that the "top man" appear before him. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said the case is one of the first in which the government 
based its prosecution on corporate negligence rather than deliberate 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
It may also be the first instance in which a corporate executive has been 
ordered to plead the guilt of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
In close questioning during a one-hour hearing, Tanner today repeatedly asked 
Tuttle who would be accountable for the spill and for preventing a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to tell you that as chief executive officer of Pennwalt that I'm here 
to represent Pennwalt and say that Pennwalt is responsible" for the events that 
occurred, Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor David Marshall, questioned extensively by Tanner about the terms of 
the plea agreement and why the government agreed to it, pointed out that 
Pennwalt was paying a higher fine than called for under the law.

New York Times foreign correspondent James Markham was found dead in his Paris 
apartment today in what police said was a suicide, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Markham, 46, had just been named the paper's next deputy foreign editor, a post 
he was to have assumed Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran correspondent, he joined the newspaper as a metropolitan reporter in 
1971 and later reported from Europe, Asia and the Middle East, serving in such 
cities as Bonn, Paris, Madrid, Beirut and Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Princeton and a former Rhodes scholar, Markham spoke half a dozen 
languages, ranging from Spanish to Hindustani. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Stephanie; their daughter, Katharine, and their 
son, Sam, who was the last American born in what was then Saigon.

Consumers have had it with commercials on the videocassettes they rent, even as 
more car and soft-drink spots are being spliced onto movie tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six percent of VCR owners said they fast-forward through commercials at 
the beginning of rented movies, according to a Nielsen Media Research study 
released at the eighth annual Video Software Dealers Assn. convention this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The study further found that more than 60% of those surveyed said they zip 
through coming attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the renters' unhappiness, though, the commercials will not be going 
away anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Home Videos' coming release of "The Land Before Time" will carry a Pizza 
Hut pitch. "Rain Man" features a Buick plug, "A Fish Called Wanda" hypes 
Schweppes and "Young Guns" hawks Nestle. 
</P>
<P>
And a number of promoters have created a ruckus at this year's convention by 
offering to open prerecorded cassettes and attach commercials for local 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Video Air Time of Midland, Tex., will put spots for florists, bowling alleys, 
attorneys and department stores on any cassette where there is room. 
</P>
<P>
Video Air Time charges about $20 per commercial per cassette, of which the 
store owner receives about $1 a tape. 
</P>
<P>
The disapproval rate reflected in the new Nielsen study comes as a major 
reversal from a Nielsen study released in April. That survey showed that 95% of 
households renting the "A Fish Called Wanda" video watched the Schweppes 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its findings on fast-forwarding commercials, the new Nielsen study 
showed that although video rental volume continues to grow, customers are 
looking for other ways to spend time, including other leisure activities, 
business, education or regular television.

PACIFIC RIM SHOT;

U.S. OFFICIAL'S JOKE RILES TRADE SUMMIT DELEGATES

A senior U.S. official embarrassed those attending a Pacific Rim trade summit 
and offended Soviet and Chinese delegates by attacking Marxism and using a 
mocking Chinese accent to tell a joke about Soviet women. 
</P>
<P>
Fred M. Zeder II, head of the government's Overseas Private Investment Corp., 
made the comments Tuesday in a speech that left organizers red-faced and many 
foreign delegates shaking their heads in embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Zeder, 68, was the first speaker on the second and last day of the $1-million 
Pacific Summit, the centerpiece of Washington state's centennial celebration. 
He was appointed to head OPIC by President Bush earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began With Joke 
</P>
<P>
Zeder began his address with a joke in which China's late Chairman Mao Zedong 
is asked by a foreign journalist what "might have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald 
had assassinated Khrushchev rather than President Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
Mimicking a Chinese accent, Zeder said Mao replied: "Only one thing certain. 
Aristotle Onassis would not have married Mrs. Khrushchev." 
</P>
<P>
Few listeners were amused, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only a joke, but I don't like the joke," said Lu Zu-wen, commercial 
consul for the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco. "He's a joker. I don't know 
what his purpose was." 
</P>
<P>
Zeder accused the Soviets of "marching into Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia," of 
"bringing Castro's Cuban mercenaries into Nicaragua, Angola and Ethiopia" and 
of spreading Marxism "every place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Dismal Failure' 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who has tried that Marxist-Leninist form of economy and ideology are 
now openly admitting that their system was a dismal failure," Zeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Zeder described how shortly after World War II a German businessman introduced 
himself and then said, "I never was a Nazi" while giving a Nazi-style salute. 
</P>
<P>
"Now every place I go in the world, people say, 'I never was a socialist.' You 
know, they all want to get on the privatization bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet delegate Vyacheslav Zilanov drew applause from other participants at a 
later forum when he criticized Zeder's remarks, particularly his harsh attack 
on Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with some of the opinions put forward by Zeder in his morning 
speech," Zilanov said. "I don't feel this Pacific Summit is the right place to 
discuss Marxist-Leninist theory and its position right now."

UTC Takes Unit Off Market: United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn., has 
taken its Norden Systems subsidiary off the market after more than a year of 
looking for a buyer willing to pay what UTC thought the radar-systems maker was 
worth, according to a letter to employees made public. UTC announced in April, 
1988, that it planned to sell Norden because it felt that Norden didn't fit 
into its overall plans and that it would fare better as part of a large defense 
electronics company. Norden, a $400-million-a-year company, makes radar systems 
for aircraft and ships. It also has a contract to make radar systems for the 
Federal Aviation Administration.

'MONSTER' BAILOUT FOR S&amp;LS SIGNED BY BUSH;

<P>
STEPS TO DEAL WITH FAILING THRIFTS TAKEN SHORTLY AFTER CEREMONY IN ROSE GARDEN

President Bush, saying, "I'm proud to sign this monster," today put his 
signature on sweeping legislation to rescue the nation's troubled savings and 
loan industry and put a $50-billion bailout into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Architects of the nearly foot-high bill, which authorizes $50 billion in new 
government borrowing over the next 26 months, attended the Rose Garden 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also imposes tough new standards on savings and loan institutions and 
triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the late-morning signing of the measure, Bush was ordering his 
Administration to gear up to close or merge hundreds of failed institutions. 
The first meeting of a new board to oversee their holdings was called 
immediately after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the measure, which received final congressional approval Saturday, 
"says to tens of millions of savings and loan depositors: You will not be the 
victims of others' mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Safeguard and Stabilize' 
</P>
<P>
Among the 300 people at the signing ceremony were Treasury Secretary Nicholas 
F. Brady, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and key Capitol 
Hill sponsors, including Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and Rep. Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairmen of the congressional banking committees. 
</P>
<P>
"This legislation comes to grips with the problems facing our savings and loan 
industry. It will safeguard and stabilize America's financial system," Bush 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
He called the measure, a variation on a bailout plan that he submitted to 
Congress on Feb. 6, "historic legislation." 
</P>
<P>
"It is responsive and responsible. And for that, I salute the Congress," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bad Loans, Repossessions 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the signing ceremony, Brady conducted the first meeting of 
the board overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp. The RTC was created to manage 
the sale of sour loans and repossessed real estate the government is inheriting 
from ailing savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC board, whose members also include Kemp and Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan, will approve operating policies for the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., the agency charged with managing the bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC has already taken over 262 failed thrifts, and the first deals to wipe 
out their losses and put them in the hands of new owners could come as early as 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Treasury Department announced plans to borrow the first $5-billion 
installment of the bailout Thursday and said it intends to raise an additional 
$15 billion within eight weeks.

A former felony conviction would not block New York Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner from taking ownership of the Canterbury Downs race track in 
Minnesota, the chairman of the Minnesota Racing Commission said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Strangis said he posed the question to the state attorney general's 
office because Steinbrenner has been invited by Minneapolis investor Carl Pohad 
to help underwrite a proposed takeover of the money-losing horse track in 
Shakopee. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's application for a Canterbury horse-racing license when the track 
opened several years ago was rejected because Minnesota law bars felons from 
holding a license to race horses in the state. 
</P>
<P>
But Steinbrenner, convicted of making illegal campaign contributions to Richard 
Nixon in the 1970s, was later pardoned by then-President Ronald Reagan. 
Strangis said he wanted to know what state law says about criminal histories 
regarding ownership of a pari-mutuel license. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was told by a lawyer in the attorney general's office that state 
laws would not hinder Steinbrenner if he were to join Pohad or take an 
ownership interest in Canterbury. 
</P>
<P>
"The felony issue would not be a problem for Steinbrenner because the pardon 
would expunge it from his record," Strangis said. 
</P>
<P>
A call to Steinbrenner's office in Tampa, Fla., was not immediately returned 
today.

BIG EAST CONFERENCE SET TO TRY OUT SIX-FOUL RULE

<P>
The Big East Conference will experiment next season with allowing players to 
commit six fouls instead of five before having to leave a game. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the rule said it will hurt underdogs by making it harder to get the 
other teams' star players out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The six-foul rule, long used in the NBA, and a proposal that the 45-second 
clock, rather than a hand count, be used to measure 10-second violations were 
approved by a vote of Big East coaches, league spokeswoman Chris Plonsky said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A third rule change, giving players three free throws instead of two if they 
are fouled while shooting a 3-point basket, was rejected, Plonsky said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experimental Rules 
</P>
<P>
The league must get NCAA permission to adopt the experimental rules, which were 
approved by the NCAA in May, but that is "usually a formality," Plonsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Niland, LeMoyne College athletic director and head of the NCAA Rules 
Committee's research subcommittee, said that approval would be automatic for 
regular-season conference games but that the committee would have to grant a 
special exception for the Big East tournament. He said the new rules could be 
used in non-conference games with the opposing coach's permission. 
</P>
<P>
The vote tally was not released, but published accounts had predicted that the 
vote on the six-foul rule would be 6-3, with Pittsburgh, Boston College and 
Connecticut the reported opponents.

ROSE ACCUSER ADMITS GIVING INFORMATION TO FEDS ON TAX EVASION 
</P>

<P>
One of Pete Rose's chief accusers in baseball's gambling probe said today that 
he has given federal investigators testimony directly linking the Cincinnati 
manager to a conspiracy to evade income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Paul G. Janszen, his voice cracking at times and tears welling in his eyes 
during a news conference, repeated many of the allegations against Rose, who is 
accused of betting on his own team. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Janszen acknowledged providing FBI and Internal Revenue 
Service agents information that could subject Rose to an indictment for 
allegedly conspiring to defraud the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Columbus, Ohio, legal maneuvering continued as baseball's lawyers 
asked a federal judge to compel Rose lawyer Roger J. Makley to answer questions 
regarding Rose's legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen, who claims to have run Rose's bets to bookmakers: 
</P>
<P>
* Said he saw documents indicating that Rose bet on baseball throughout the 
1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
* Denied he prompted baseball's investigation, saying he was contacted by the 
commissioner's office after someone else gave information. 
</P>
<P>
* Repeated that Rose never, to Janszen's knowledge, became involved in cocaine 
deals, despite allegedly asking how much he could make on them. 
</P>
<P>
* Repeated that Reds pitcher John Franco knew about Rose's debts with a Staten 
Island bookmaker nicknamed Val. 
</P>
<P>
* Said other Reds players, whom he would not identify, knew of Rose's alleged 
gambling before charges became public. 
</P>
<P>
* Said Rose lawyer Rueven J. Katz knew of the alleged gambling problems as 
early as March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen served four months in a halfway house after pleading guilty to 
falsifying his 1985 federal income tax return and failing to report income from 
steroid sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if he'll ever understand it, but in a weird way, I feel I'm 
helping him," Janszen said. "If I have one regret, that regret is that I was 
not man enough to walk up to Pete Rose . . . to say to him: 'That's it. No 
more.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Gonna Get Me' 
</P>
<P>
Janszen said that each time he brought up the dangers to Rose, the Reds manager 
said: "They're not gonna get me. They can't get me. I have good attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
Rose has said that when he learned Janszen was involved in drug-dealing, he 
stopped associating with him. Janszen denied that, saying: "Pete Rose knew that 
from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Janszen, who began cooperating with the government in March, 1988, and with 
baseball this February, claimed Rose's alleged gambling was well known in the 
Reds clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of players who probably knew, and I knew of some that had direct 
knowledge of what was going on," he said. "It's kind of difficult for them to 
step forward, don't you think, to take Paul Janszen's side against the Reds."

South Korea said today that it will not reopen talks with North Korea on 
sending a joint team to the 1990 Beijing Asian Games unless Pyongyang stops 
hostile propaganda against the south. 
</P>
<P>
"Talks can only resume when North Korea proves it has stopped all political 
machinations to agitate the south," Seoul's chief delegate Chang Chung-sik said 
in response to an offer by Pyongyang on Tuesday to reopen the talks. 
</P>
<P>
The two Koreas, still technically at war, have agreed in principle to field a 
single team to the Beijing Games but have a host of details to fix.

Seoul broke off the talks last month.

NON-TEACHING STAFF STAGES SICKOUT AT SADDLEBACK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the first day of registration for the fall semester, about a third of the 
non-teaching employees of Saddleback Community College District staged a 
sickout Tuesday in an apparent dispute over contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives insisted the action was neither organized nor condoned by 
the California School Employees Assn., which represents the 380 clerical, 
custodial and technical workers at the district's two campuses. 
</P>
<P>
But administrators, who had to man registration tables as about 1,000 students 
signed up for the fall semester at Saddleback College, said the action is 
almost definitely related to contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley Also Hit 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley College was also hit by the sickout, although to a lesser degree, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Richard J. Sneed, who was helping out at Saddleback College's 
registration, said administrators had heard rumors of an impending sickout as 
early as late last week. He said he met with two union leaders, and they 
assured him they were not organizing such an action. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is certainly related to that," Sneed said. "This action concerns us 
because it is contrary to the law, and it is obviously not in the best 
interests of the community or the students." 
</P>
<P>
He said all employees who called in sick Tuesday would be docked a day's pay 
unless they present a doctor's written excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Tamara Carnine, chief negotiator for the CSEA chapter, said she had no 
information about a job action. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea how many people are out today," she said. "It's not a job 
action sponsored or organized or whatever by the CSEA. If somebody is calling 
it a job action, CSEA isn't. . . . I don't see how anybody can say it's an 
illegal action because it's not an organized action." 
</P>
<P>
Of the ongoing contract negotiations, she said they were "not going real well. 
Right now we're waiting for fact-finding to start taking place." 
</P>
<P>
The workers have been without a contract since June 30 and are seeking a pay 
increase of 4% to 7%, plus the implementation of a new job classification plan 
which will include raises for many workers retroactive to July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
One stumbling block has been how to implement the classification plan, Sneed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mediation Accepted 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to negotiate whether to do this in one year or over a period of two 
years. . . . That's part of the discussion -- how much can we do, over what 
period of time, plus the cost of living," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district and the representatives have agreed to go to mediation, and are 
awaiting fact-finding, a process of investigation directed by the state's 
Public Employment Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have been staging picket lines in the mornings before work and then 
again after work. About 60 of them picketed a Board of Trustees meeting last 
month, Carnine said. 
</P>
<P>
Classified workers include secretaries, admissions and records personnel, 
painters, carpenters, electricians, purchasing personnel, information services 
and systems workers and even the public information officer, who did report for 
work on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority (of employees) are here," Chancellor Sneed said. "But if you 
have people missing from every department, then every department is hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Registration on Tuesday was held until 8:30 p.m. Saddleback College President 
Constance M. Carroll manned one of the tables along with the deans of some 
departments and some faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Chancellor William Kelly stood outside the registration office, answering 
questions of students in line to make sure the process did not get bogged down. 
But throughout most of the day, there were never more than about a dozen people 
in line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate, but we're coping," he said. "Everything seems to be going 
pretty well. There are no long lines." 
</P>
<P>
In the library, where students went to make their course selections, many said 
they did not even notice there was a job action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's running pretty smoothly," said student Joe Waters, 18. "It would probably 
help to have people who are used to doing this, but these people are doing a 
great job under the circumstances."

FLEEING CAR CRASHES INTO JAMMED COMPACT; 9 INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nine people, including five children packed into a compact car, were injured 
Tuesday night when a vehicle being pursued by Anaheim police crashed into the 
compact near a dead-end street in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, a red Chevrolet Camaro that was being chased by police 
slammed into a Toyota Celica near the intersection of Brookhurst Road and 
Commonwealth Avenue shortly before 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Toyota was thrown from the car on impact. The Toyota, which 
was carrying the children, the driver and two others, turned on its side. 
</P>
<P>
The children were ages 3 to 12, according to police at the scene. A woman was 
strapped into one of the seats with one child in the Toyota, which has seat 
belts for four people, according to police at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The names and conditions of the injured were not immediately available, but two 
people -- the female driver of the pursued car and a passenger in the Toyota -- 
were knocked unconscious and others suffered scrapes and cuts, according to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police said a Jaws of Life hydraulic prying tool was brought to the 
scene to free the driver of the Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
According to Anaheim police, the pursuit started about 9:45 p.m. near Ball 
Avenue and Nutwood Street. The pursuit lasted about six minutes at speeds of up 
to 80 m.p.h. before it ended at the northeast corner of Commonwealth and 
Brookhurst. The collision sent both cars slamming into light poles, knocking 
out traffic signals at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known why the car was being pursued. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Camaro, who was alone in the car, was arrested, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
The injured were transported to St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in 
Fullerton, UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, United Western Medical Center -- 
Santa Ana and Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.

KRAFT LAWYER SAYS EXECUTION WOULD BE 'MORE VIOLENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for Randy Steven Kraft told jurors shortly before they began 
deliberations Tuesday that if the convicted serial killer is executed, "the 
only thing it would accomplish would be more violence; another family would 
lose a loved one, another mother will bury another son." 
</P>
<P>
C. Thomas McDonald, in closing remarks in the two-month-long death penalty 
hearing, relied heavily on defense psychiatric tests that showed Kraft suffered 
from brain abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
"If we stand for anything that is real, we don't kill people who have brain 
damage," McDonald argued in a Santa Ana courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, who convicted Kraft three months ago of 16 Orange County murders, 
today will begin their first full day of deliberations on a verdict of death or 
life in prison without parole. Their ruling will end the year-long trial that 
many believe could be one of the most costly in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin sent them into the jury room Tuesday 
afternoon to begin deliberations. But after choosing a foreman, they told the 
judge that they preferred to go home and start fresh in the morning. McCartin, 
who sequestered the panel at an area hotel during the trial's guilt-phase 
deliberations, chose not to sequester them this time. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors had heard closing arguments Monday from Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. 
Brown, who told them that Kraft killed his victims for his own evil, sexual 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, a computer consultant from Long Beach, has denied killing 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
All of the victims were young men, most between the ages of 18 and 25. The 
bodies of most of them showed signs of sexual mutilation or sexual abuse and 
were dumped along freeway ramps or in remote areas. Besides the 16 murders in 
the guilt phase of the trial, the prosecutor linked Kraft to eight more 
homicides in the penalty phase: six in Oregon and two in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, both McDonald and defense co-counsel James G. Merwin argued to the 
jurors that they couldn't help but think that there had to be questions left 
unanswered about Kraft's guilt on some of the homicides. 
</P>
<P>
Merwin's role was to raise doubts about Kraft's guilt in the Oregon and 
Michigan homicides, which were added to the case in the penalty phase to help 
support the prosecution's request for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors will not return verdicts on Kraft's guilt in any of those homicides. 
But under the law, they can consider those eight other homicides in deciding a 
death verdict if they are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Kraft is 
guilty of them. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Merwin also raised questions about some of the 16 murders the same 
jury already has convicted Kraft of committing. He told jurors that he is still 
perplexed about their decision to find Kraft guilty of killing 22-year-old Mark 
Howard Hall, whose body was found in a remote area on Jan. 3, 1976. Kraft's 
fingerprints were found at the scene, but his lawyers have argued that the Hall 
killing was too much unlike the other murders. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm naive or maybe I'm just too close to this case," Merwin said, "but I 
find it hard to believe that even as you were voting that Mr. Kraft was guilty 
that you didn't have some doubt as to who actually killed Hall. I constantly 
think back to Hall when I think about this case." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald asked aloud whether Kraft might be covering up for someone. Or did his 
brain damage affect his memory? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the answers," McDonald said. "But these answers, these clues, are 
going to be snuffed out if you don't vote for life (without parole). The 
origins of these crimes, the potential cures for these crimes, are going to 
extinguish with Randy's life." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's primary argument for jurors, however, was against the death penalty 
itself on moral grounds. He quoted his 74-year-old mother, when he sought her 
advice on what to say: "She said, 'Tommy' -- I'm 47 years old and she still 
calls me Tommy -- 'there has to be a better way.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The use of the power to kill has never elevated us," McDonald added. " . . . 
The violence has to stop. Killing Randy is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated a full two weeks before finding Kraft guilty of first-degree 
murder in all 16 murder charges against him. Speculation was rampant Tuesday 
among court watchers and some people connected with the case about how long 
jurors will take to decide the single issue verdict of death vs. life without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
"It's either going to be one day or one week," said one person involved in the 
case who preferred not to be named. "It all depends on how they decide to go 
about it."

TELLER SURVIVES HOLDUP ONLY TO LOSE HER JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bank teller Melissa Gamer believes she was lucky to get away with her life 
after a gun-toting robber took almost $4,000 from her window Friday at Great 
Western Bank in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But after finishing work Monday, the 21-year-old Cal State Fullerton student, 
who works part time at the bank, was called to her boss's desk and fired. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that I had too much money in my drawer" when the robbery 
occurred, she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gamer was fired for breaking a rule that limits the amount of money a teller 
may keep in her drawer, said Lynn Taylor, director of public relations for 
Great Western. Clerks are supposed to put money in the safe after their till 
has more than a certain amount, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible that she was ignorant of the policy," Taylor said. "Especially 
since she had signed a statement confirming that she knew her limit." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gamer said Tuesday that she was unaware of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew what my limit was," she said. "I had almost never handled cash 
before because I'd only been a teller for three days." 
</P>
<P>
Gamer, a 1986 graduate of Marina High School and a member of the Delta Zeta 
sorority at Cal State Fullerton, acknowledged that she signed a form confirming 
that she could have only $2,500 in her drawer. But she said she signed it three 
years ago when she started working at the bank as a part-time data entry clerk. 
</P>
<P>
She said she worked in the data-entry job the entire time, and it wasn't until 
July 31, the Monday before the robbery, that she was finally made a bank 
teller. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew how to do a lot of operational things, but I had never . . . learned 
how to be a teller," Gamer said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Wednesday and Friday of last week, she took deposits and withdrawals 
from customers. Then, at 3:30 p.m. on Friday, a short dark man with a mustache 
approached her window and asked her to save his place in line while he went 
outside and waited for a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to come back to my window because he didn't want to wait in line," 
Gamer said. "He walked outside for a minute and then, when I was done with my 
customer, he handed me a note. At the same time, he lifted up his shirt to show 
what appeared to be a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he said, 'Honey, don't make me hurt you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gamer then told the man to wait while she got a bag. As she bent down, she 
pressed the alarm button with her left hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to push the button quietly, but I had thoughts of Rebecca 
Schaeffer being shot in the chest and dying right there," Gamer said, referring 
to the young actress who was killed last month in her Los Angeles apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Gamer admits that she had more than the $2,500 allowed under bank rules in her 
drawer but said she deserved another chance rather than be fired. 
</P>
<P>
The bank, however, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule is there to limit losses in robberies and is strictly enforced," said 
Great Western spokeswoman Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor acknowledged that Gamer did what a teller is supposed to do when 
confronted by a robber. But, "a policy is a policy," said Taylor. "We're out 
$4,000. . . . We're the one who lost."

COLLEGE GETS GRANT TO AID POTENTIAL DROPOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Santiago College has been awarded a $387,000 U.S. Department of 
Education grant to assist high school students identified as being likely to

The project, conducted in cooperation with the Santa Ana Unified School 
District and the Central County Regional Occupation Program, targets 225 
17-year-old students who are one or more years behind academically. Students 
enrolled in the Rancho Santiago program receive English literacy instruction, 
vocational training and peer tutoring, and also attend biweekly group meetings. 
In addition, child care, bus passes and other services are available to help 
students continue in the program. 
</P>
<P>
The federal grant, one of 10 awarded nationwide, provides 60% of the total 
funding over an 18-month period. The remainder of costs will be contributed by 
Rancho Santiago and the Santa Ana school district.

<P>
COUNCIL WEIGHS METHOD OF SELECTING A MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-2 majority of the City Council indicated support Tuesday for returning to 
the system of choosing a mayor from among council members, but postponed a 
decision on whether to put the issue before voters. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Anaheim voters passed an amendment to the City Charter that provided 
for the direct election of a mayor apart from the City Council. Under the 
amendment, a council member must serve two years before becoming eligible to 
run for mayor. Previously, the mayoral position had been rotated among the 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
The council took up the matter Tuesday because Aug. 11 is the deadline for 
placing issues on November's special election ballot. Council members Thomas 
Daly, Miriam Kaywood and Irv Pickler said they were inclined to support placing 
the mayoral election issue on the ballot, but not until the city's Charter 
Review Committee completes its report in the spring. Mayor Fred Hunter and 
Councilman William D. Ehrle oppose changing the existing system.

PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: A COSTA MESA ARTIST FINDS COSMETIC TATTOOING IS 
DRAWING QUITE A CLIENTELE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early on, Pati Pavlik showed a knack for pen-and-ink drawings and created what 
she considers some worthwhile pieces of art. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the Costa Mesa resident traded in the ink, pen and paper and a 
data-processing job for a tattoo needle to draw art on people's skin. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'What's my mother going to think?' " recalled Pavlik, 45, who said 
she was brought up in Middle America at a time when "ladies certainly never got 
a tattoo." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, for her mother's 69th birthday, Pavlik tattooed a hummingbird 
on the crest of her mother's shoulder. Her mother was also her second client 
for eyebrow and eye liner. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, cosmetic tattooing now accounts for half my business," said Pavlik, 
who teaches classes on cosmetic tattooing at the American Institute of 
Electrology in Long Beach and has a tattoo shop in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The best work (in cosmetic tattooing) is coming from tattoo artists, not the 
medical field," she said. "They haven't been able to get the training for 
tattooing. It takes a lot of years to get proficient with a tattoo needle." 
</P>
<P>
The move to cosmetic tattooing was a boon to Pavlik, a 10-year member of the 
American Tattooing Assn. "You get bored doing hearts and flowers every day even 
though you often get a chance to create a real piece of art," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlik said that when she opened her shop, more and more women were getting 
tattoos, but they wanted "something creative." 
</P>
<P>
In a decade, Pavlik said, she's done some unusual tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think of myself as a conservative, and I get startled with some of the 
requests," she said. "A woman who managed a pet store wanted a beautiful cat 
tattooed from her wrist to the bend of her arm, and I thought to myself, 'My 
goodness -- how bold.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pavlik said she had no tattoos of her own when she opened her business. Times 
and her body have changed, and now, most of her back, shoulders and rib cage 
are tattooed. A portrait of her mother and father can be found on her back. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother and dad were supportive of me when I decided to open the tattoo 
business," said Pavlik, who also has tattoos covering the inside of her right 
arm and parts of her legs. 
</P>
<P>
In her spare time, the tattoo artist raises hybrid wolves that she hopes to 
introduce into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday I hope to spend my life around endangered species," said Pavlik, who 
also owns four dogs, three ferrets, two cats, an iguana and a horse. 
</P>
<P>
To feed her other artistic urges, Pavlik works with clay, leather, bones and 
driftwood as well as dabbling in taxidermy. 
</P>
<P>
"I love life -- I really do," she said. "Some people think I'm tough because I 
have tattoos, but I still think of myself as a flower child who wants nothing 
more than peace, love and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Janet L. Wooley enrolled in a job training program at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana to become self-supporting and get off state 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
For her determination and success in the program, the 30-year-old high school 
dropout and a single mother of two has been selected Participant of the Year by 
the County of Orange Private Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the opportunity to learn a trade and better myself," the Irvine woman 
said. "And I want to make enough money to support myself and my two children." 
</P>
<P>
The skills she learned got her a job as a clerk in an Irvine hospital supply 
company, and she soon was promoted to a sales support position at a higher 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wooley said she no longer needs state financial support. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can give my family the future they deserve," she said. 
</P>
<P>

Irvine, a pediatrician; Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan, of Santa Ana, and 
Steve Timmons, now of San Diego and two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner in 
volleyball, will be inducted into OCC's Alumni Hall of Fame on Sept. 15 at the 
college.

MOTORIST OFFERS UZI TO PAY GASOLINE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes people don't have enough money to pay for gasoline at service 
stations, a petroleum company official said. So they leave collateral such as 
watches, wallets or jewelry until they can get the money to pay. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a man driving a motor home offered a gas attendant at a Mobil 
station something different -- an Uzi semiautomatic machine gun, Irvine police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The attendant told Irvine police that the man, who had rung up a $23 debt for 
gas, had no money and said that his credit card was overdrawn. After the 
attendant decided not to accept a check, the man offered him the unloaded gun, 
said Mobil Oil Corp. spokesman Jim Carbonetti, who would not identify the 
attendant at the company's University Drive station. 
</P>
<P>
The attendant on duty at the station Tuesday afternoon would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Carbonetti said the attendant called police to check the permit of the gun. 
Irvine Police Sgt. Scott Cade said a check showed that the gun was legally 
registered in the motorist's name. 
</P>
<P>
So the gun owner drove off, leaving the attendant with the weapon. Carbonetti 
said he hopes the gun soon will be reclaimed.

MARINA DEL REY LEASE SALE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After receiving assurances that a secretive group of foreign investors is not 
involved in drug trafficking, money laundering, criminal activity or terrorism, 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved a 
complex deal giving the overseas interests a 49.9% stake in prime leases at 
Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The $21.8-million deal -- the largest foreign investment ever at the marina -- 
spans at least four countries and involves 10 newly formed California 
corporations, a Cayman Islands tax shelter, a Luxembourg holding company, a 
Paris-based bank and foreign investors who value their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The marina is owned by the county. Businesses there operate on long-term leases 
that can be bought and sold much like conventional real estate. 
</P>
<P>
County officials who oversee the marina said they do not know the identity or 
nationality of the investors. The leases involved are on 10 properties, 
including three hotels, two apartment complexes, restaurants, tourist 
facilities, a shopping center, office building and hundreds of boat slips. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked and we were told right from the beginning that they wished to remain 
anonymous," said Ted Reed, director of the county Department of Beaches and 
Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
The seller of the lease interests is the marina's largest leaseholder, Abraham 
M. Lurie, president and owner of Real Property Management Inc. Lurie said he, 
too, does not know the identity of the foreign investors who have become his 
business partners. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie retains a controlling 50.1% interest in all 10 leases. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have made highly publicized purchases of privately owned 
Southern California real estate in recent years. The marina transaction differs 
from these in that it involves publicly owned land. 
</P>
<P>
After The Times asked last month about the identity of the investors, county 
officials requested and received written assurances from the group's Chicago 
attorney, Cornelius J. Sullivan, that the investors are successful foreign 
business persons who "prefer to protect their privacy and avoid the public 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
"They are wealthy individuals who . . . wish to remain anonymous in order to 
avoid hucksters, flimflam men, gold diggers, extortionists, kidnapers, 
terrorists and similar criminal elements that tend to gravitate to and feed 
upon the prominent and well-to-do," Sullivan wrote county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Their principal activities involve real estate investments throughout the 
world as well as active commercial businesses in the areas of trading and 
general commerce," Sullivan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specific Disclaimers 
</P>
<P>
"Their businesses do not in any way involve trafficking in drugs, laundering 
money, or other criminal activity. Further, they are not in any way related to 
what we in the United States refer to as the 'Mafia,' nor are their businesses 
in any way akin to those generally identified with the Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sullivan and county officials, the deal was structured 
specifically to protect the anonymity of the investors and minimize their U.S. 
taxes. The California companies involved are owned by a parent firm in the 
Cayman Islands, a Caribbean archipelago with tax laws favorable to 
international investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Caymans company, Marina Enterprises International Ltd., is owned in turn by 
North American Real Estate Holding, based in Luxembourg, a small European duchy 
with incorporation laws requiring minimal public disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. Goff, a principal in the Los Angeles office of the Laventhol &amp; 
Horwath accounting firm, gave county officials a letter before the supervisors 
meeting stating that the investors "are not from any country suspected of 
terrorism, nor are they involved with any terrorist or subversive 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
Goff added that the investors do not live in a communist country and do not 
have any dealings with South Africa. In a telephone interview, he refused to 
identify the investors. "I am not at liberty to say," Goff said. "I can't 
provide any information." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the deal was the first involving a marina lease where the new 
partners have remained anonymous. "This is quite common in Europe and other 
places," he said. But he acknowledged that it is unique as far as the marina is 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Personal Knowledge 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know anything about the investors," he said. "I'm taking the word of 
attorneys and certified public accountants that they are who they represent 
they are. . . . Their statement was these people are not involved in illegal 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the leases, Reed told the supervisors, the county cannot 
unreasonably withhold approval of a change in Lurie's business partners. 
</P>
<P>
He said the transaction must meet three tests -- an assessment of the new 
partners' financial condition, the effect on rents charged for apartments and 
boat slips, and whether the change is in the best interests of the marina. 
</P>
<P>
On all three counts, Reed said, the deal should be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David Naftalin, representing the Marina Tenants Assn., a group of 
apartment renters, disagreed. Urging the supervisors to reject the deal, he 
said the county has absolutely no information on the financial condition of the 
investors. To maintain proper control over public property, he said, the county 
"ought to know" who the investors are.

EX-ARIZONA BASKETBALL COACH IS HAPPY IN ICE CREAM BUSINESS, BUT MISSES THRILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the basketball coach at the University of Arizona when a major athletic 
scandal swept the school in the early 1980s, Fred Snowden got used to traveling 
down a rocky road. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Snowden still deals with the rocky road. 
</P>
<P>
And the chocolate fudge swirl, the pralines 'n' cream, the raspberry sherbet 
and 27 other flavors. 
</P>
<P>
He is the vice president in charge of urban affairs and business development 
for the Baskin-Robbins ice cream company, working to bring his product into new 
market areas. It is a job of selling, and there have been few better salesmen 
than Snowden. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, for example, trying to persuade an 18-year-old, street-slick kid from 
Detroit to leave everything and everybody he knows and move 2,000 miles west to 
Tucson, where the number of rattlesnakes was exceeded only by the number of 
scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
"I sold kids on the University of Arizona, and it was the same as selling ice 
cream," Snowden said. "No difference at all. It's just a matter of how you 
package it." 
</P>
<P>
Snowden, 52, became the first black head basketball coach at a major university 
when he took the Arizona job in 1972. A few months later, John Thompson became 
coach at Georgetown and George Raveling got the job at Washington State. But 
Snowden was the first. And for a while, he was the best. 
</P>
<P>
He took a 6-20 Wildcat team from the 1971-72 season and molded it into a 16-10 
team in his first season. In the next three years, his teams posted records of 
19-7, 22-7 and 24-9, the 1975-76 Wildcats winning the Western Athletic 
Conference championship for the first time in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
During the same four years, Thompson at Georgetown and Raveling at Washington 
State were not faring well. 
</P>
<P>
"My program got off the ground quicker than their programs did and I think for 
the future of blacks in college coaching, it was a good thing one of us 
succeeded right away," Snowden said. "Because I was the first, I felt a lot 
depended on whether I did well and whether I was perceived as a person of 
quality for the other black Americans who would come along. 
</P>
<P>
"People have told me in the years since that the success of my teams in those 
first four years was one of the pivotal reasons that opportunities began to 
open up for other black coaches. After me, the door was opened." 
</P>
<P>
Snowden, as you may have detected, is not bashful about discussing his 
accomplishments. And there were many. He was voted Tucson's man of the year in 
1973 and was chosen by a Tucson newspaper as Arizona's coach of the decade in 
1979. His name made its way into Black America's Who's Who in 1979 and into 
Who's Who in America the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden, born in a sharecropper's shack in Brewton, Ala., moved with his family 
to Detroit when he was 6 and graduated from Northwestern High School in 1955. 
He later returned to the school as basketball coach and had a five-year record 
of 89-5. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out I liked coaching, and that I was very good at it," Snowden said. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually became an assistant coach at the University of Michigan under 
Johnny Orr. When Michigan's assistant athletic director, Dave Strack, became 
Arizona's athletic director in 1971, he summoned Snowden. The Wildcats quickly 
became one of the best teams in the country. 
</P>
<P>
So why is this man who was seemingly born to coach now sitting at a desk trying 
to figure out where to build another ice cream stand? 
</P>
<P>
Snowden was accused by several newspapers of having a slush fund at Arizona, of 
siphoning airline ticket money from the university and even players' meal money 
into it. The rumors were never proved, however, and a long investigation by the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. left Snowden unmarked. 
</P>
<P>
But his colleague at Arizona during the '70s, football Coach Tony Mason, was 
indicted along with six of his assistant coaches on felony charges of theft, 
fraudulent schemes and practices, filing false claims and tampering with public 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the University of Arizona's athletic program became synonymous with 
all that was wrong with college sports. 
</P>
<P>
And the burden dragged Snowden down. 
</P>
<P>
"The talk ruined everybody at the school," Snowden said. "Me and the football 
coach and the baseball coach and the track coach. Everybody. Even though only 
the football program was involved, we all came down. Recruiting became 
impossible. I decided I didn't want to labor under that cloud anymore." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 8, 1982, during halftime of the Wildcats' game against Washington, the 
announcement was handed to the press: Snowden would resign at the end of the 
season and would become the school's assistant athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The ink on the press releases was hardly dry, though, when that plan crumbled. 
Under pressure from the school's Board of Regents, the administration announced 
the next week that Snowden would be taking a job coordinating athletic events. 
This would involve such important duties as making sure the bus is on time to 
take the swim team to its meet. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden bowed out gracefully. The most successful coach the school's basketball 
team had ever had rode off into the Arizona sunset, headed for California. He 
formed Fred Snowden, Inc., a consulting firm, and quickly landed Baskin-Robbins 
as a client. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the ice cream maker decided to bring Snowden, who now lives in 
Calabasas, into the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back, what I miss most are the associations," Snowden said. "The 
friendships and the great camaraderie that exists between players and coaches, 
and between a coach and other coaches. And I miss the unique kinds of 
challenges that coaching presents. As a coach, your report card is marked 
instantly, that night. You know that night whether you did well or not. They 
put it up in lights on a scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss the immediacy of that, the instant decision-making process that you 
live with all the time as a coach. Corporate decisions don't quite work that 
way. There are meetings and management groups and eventually you come to a 
decision, but it doesn't always happen right away. 
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, you call a timeout and you see the players walking back toward the 
bench and you know that you had better come up with an idea, and a very good 
idea, before they get there. That's a lot of pressure. That is very unique in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"But I enjoyed that and I was very good at it." 
</P>
<P>
With all the turbulence of his departure from Arizona, one would think that 
there are things Snowden does not miss about coaching. He can't seem to think 
of any, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to say what I don't miss about coaching," he said. "I don't 
sit around and say how much I hated coaching, how it gave me ulcers. I never 
had any stomach problems when I coached. I loved coaching. I loved the good and 
the bad of coaching. It is such a great profession and it was such a major part 
of my life for so long. When I left coaching, I never said that I would never 
coach again. Actually, I thought I would." 
</P>
<P>
Snowden was considered for several coaching jobs, including Cal State Long 
Beach's in 1983, but he had immersed himself in his new business. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years after he left Arizona, however, there are once again thoughts of 
X's and O's. 
</P>
<P>
"Would I coach again? It would depend on the circumstances," he said. "I would 
not rule out a return to coaching some day. I was good at it. I did that very 
well. And I think I might be even better at it the second time around, using 
all that I have learned. 
</P>
<P>
"The day might come around again when a school is looking for someone to build 
a program and they'll remember me. And I often think about getting into the 
executive side of professional sports some day. With all the talk these days of 
trying to find qualified minorities for high-level positions in pro sports, I 
believe my resume would stack up against anyone's."

MIKE DOWNEY: DIVAC'S QUEST LEADS TO WEST AND THE LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vlade Divac has everything going for him, except an unfortunate set of 
initials. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, this is a guy whose monogrammed towels you wouldn't want to 
borrow. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the first-round draft choice of the Lakers is a happy pro basketball 
camper. 
</P>
<P>
He is part of our foreign-exchange program, in which a student from the United 
States goes to Europe, and vice versa. This year, we got Divac from Yugoslavia 
and sent a Duke kid to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The Big V signed a contract Monday with the Lakers, who promptly sent him off 
to their summer camp for privileged youth. 
</P>
<P>
Vlade has a few things to learn -- like English. Of course, same goes for many 
National Basketball Assn. rookies, thanks to America's popular student-athlete 
scholarship programs. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has signed his contract, Vlade is playing tourist this week, 
carrying around his "How to See California on $5,000 a Day" guide. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers hope to turn Big V into the next Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. They don't 
expect to get 21 years out of him, but then again, by the year 2010, maybe 
they'll be giving him a new Rolls-Royce and calling him Cap. 
</P>
<P>
The Americanization of Vlade has begun. Give him a year or two and he'll be 
sitting next to Joan Rivers in a "Hollywood Squares" box. 
</P>
<P>
Vlade is just now feeling his way around the Forum, getting ready for November, 
the usual. He shocked teammates by showing up for his news conference with 
goggles and a shaved head with styling mousse on it, apologizing later by 
saying: "I thought this how everybody look." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, meanwhile, has been busy this summer taking Berlitz lessons in 
Serbo-Croatian, trying to learn how to say: "Watch out for this pass, big 
fella, before it hits you in the face." 
</P>
<P>
The whole Laker gang has been explaining some of the basics to Divac -- like, 
oh, you know, how every home game will begin with Randy Newman's recording of 
"I Love Zagreb," followed by renditions of the American and Yugoslav national 
anthems by various guest artists.

<P>
Vlade got very excited when he heard that Tito had season tickets at courtside, 
until he found out they meant one of Michael Jackson's brothers. Vlade has a 
lot to learn about Hollywood celebrities and the Laker Girls and all. He still 
thinks Paula Abdul is a Saudi oilman. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21 years old and already 7 feet 1 inch in his stocking feet -- although, 
somewhat confusingly, only 6-11 in his shoes -- Divac is a former member of the 
Yugoslav Olympic team who remains very impressed with American coaching, 
despite having seen John Thompson in action. 
</P>
<P>
Big V even made a joke Monday, through his interpreter, that the reason he 
chose Laker uniform No. 12 was that he found out it was Coach Pat Riley's 
number in his NBA days. Now that he's under contract, the next number he wants 
is Riley's tailor's. 
</P>
<P>
Vlade said he wanted to play pro basketball in America as soon as he heard that 
Los Angeles drafted him, and as soon as he heard which Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At NBA draft headquarters in New York, just to be safe, Vlade asked his old 
friend from international basketball circles, Danny Ferry, whether it was true 
that it was the Clippers that had chosen Ferry and the Lakers that had chosen 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"No speak-a da English," Ferry replied. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how Ferry got picked second from the top and Divac second from the 
bottom. This must have confirmed everything Vlade had heard about America, that 
the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. 
</P>
<P>
Vlade is very excited to be working for the Lakers, and is working on a few 
English phrases, including: 
</P>
<P>
"Throw me ball, Ma-jeek, over here, you bet!" 
</P>
<P>
"Get out my face, Lam-beer, you no damn good you!" 
</P>
<P>
"This game in refrigerator close door make popcorn!" 
</P>
<P>
"I go set pick for A.G. Creen now, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh hello, Mr. Joker, I thought sure Batman kill you!" 
</P>
<P>
"You guys from media just make up quotes, you dirty pigs, get out my locker!" 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson will probably teach him a few more. You know Mychal, always 
serious about his work. Mychal probably will tell Vlade that in America, 
rookies have to scrub the floor after practice. 
</P>
<P>
It should be great fun having the Serbo-Croatian Sensation on the squad this 
season. The Lakers have gone from world champions to world travelers. When they 
and their Yugoslav meet up with the Golden State Warriors and their Soviet, the 
referees had better be Earl Strom and Henry Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
We don't know how Divac will adjust to life in the NBA, but we do know that no 
matter what nasty things get yelled at him in Detroit or Boston, he won't let 
them bother him. Because he won't know what they're saying. 
</P>
<P>
We only hope that when Riley orders him to "Go in for Orlando," Vlade 
understands that he means for Woolridge, and not for the Florida expansion 
team.

<P>
On Aug. 9, 1988, Wayne Gretzky bid a tearful adieu to the people of Edmonton, 
choked out a few words that didn't really explain why he had asked to be 
traded, climbed into Bruce McNall's private plane and flew into what was then 
considered hockey oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Off to Los Angeles, of all places, in a stunning trade. 
</P>
<P>
It changed the course of many lives, altered the balance of power in the 
National Hockey League, affected television contracts and bottom lines, has 
been reflected in many a player's renegotiations and, McNall believes, will 
make Los Angeles a hockey town. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere over the Rockies, Gretzky dried his tears. He greeted his new life 
with a smile and with the hope that he would, someday, waltz with another 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
It was an amazingly quick transition, even for the Great One. 
</P>
<P>
How long had he known it was coming? Was it really what he wanted? 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Oiler owner Peter Pocklington told reporters that day a year ago that 
Gretzky had asked to be traded to the Kings because he wanted to spend more 
time with his bride, Janet Jones, and that he had let Gretzky go with a heavy 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gretzky later said that Janet was not behind the trade, that there was 
no cause for radio talk-show hosts in Canada to call her a Jezebel and liken 
her role in breaking up the champion Edmonton Oilers to Yoko Ono's role in 
breaking up the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
And how about Gretzky's tears? Were they real? Pocklington later said that they 
were phony. All for show. 
</P>
<P>
That was no act, Gretzky says. And he is sure that anyone who has ever seen him 
try to act will agree. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point in time, I felt like everyone else," Gretzky said. "I couldn't 
believe it was happening. It wasn't as if we had just lost. We had just won the 
Stanley Cup for the fourth time in five years. I had had, arguably, my best 
playoff ever. I won the Conn Smythe, and, all of a sudden, I'm traded. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of disbelief for everyone. That was my feeling more than anything 
else. To this day, I'm like . . . every other sports fan. To think, two years 
ago, that I would be playing in L.A.? It's hard to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that is funny about it all, I was very disappointed when I left 
Edmonton. I thought of all the great times and fun memories. And yet, on the 
way home, with Mr. McNall, it was like it had happened a year ago. It was 10 
minutes ago. By then, I was ready to move on. I was really looking forward to 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time." 
</P>
<P>
What was behind the trade that sent Gretzky, Mike Krushelnyski and Marty 
McSorley to the Kings for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, three first-round draft 
picks and $15 million? 
</P>
<P>
Business. It was simply business. 
</P>
<P>
As Gretzky said so often in the months that followed: "Owners don't do 
$15-million favors for wives." 
</P>
<P>
So what was Gretzky's role in the trade that caused Pocklington to be hanged in 
effigy? And how does Gretzky feel after a year of living as a King? 
</P>
<P>
It all started, Gretzky recalls, on the night that the Oilers won their fourth 
Stanley Cup. It was as if someone had a secret, he said, and as soon as the 
game was over, everyone wanted to be the first to tell him. 
</P>
<P>
He was being shopped around. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he didn't believe it. Merely another rumor. He went out and 
celebrated with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
But it started sounding pretty serious when he got a call at 8:30 the next 
morning from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just getting home," Gretzky said. "I hadn't even been to bed yet. I was 
lying on my couch . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big surprise to get a call like that right after winning the Stanley 
Cup. . . . I thought I had played pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky called Pocklington to ask what was going on and was told that the time 
had come to get a new contract signed. 
</P>
<P>
The contract that Gretzky and the Oilers had, at that time, was going to leave 
Gretzky as an absolute free agent in 1991. Pocklington couldn't let that 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year contract had been signed hurriedly during the summer of 1987, 
when Pocklington was planning to offer public stock in the Oilers. Pocklington 
couldn't do that with Gretzky under the long-term personal services contract 
that ran through '99 -- hence, Gretzky's number -- that they had signed when 
Pocklington bought Gretzky's World Hockey Assn. team. Gretzky agreed to sign a 
five-year contract with the Oilers without haggling as long as he had the 
termination clause. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember signing the contract knowing that I was going to be either re-done 
or traded within one or two years, so it wasn't a surprise to me," Gretzky 
said. "It came down to the fact that we couldn't come to an agreement. My 
understanding was that if we couldn't come to an agreement, he would have to 
move me. That's when it came down to business." 
</P>
<P>
The shock he felt when Vancouver called him was, largely, the result of the 
timing. He hadn't expected to be getting calls the morning after the 
championship game, and certainly not before Pocklington had tried to get him 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
As the negotiations unfolded in the next few weeks, Gretzky came to understand 
that he was in control when it came to the teams bidding for him. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt that it would be best for everyone that I wasn't unhappy where I was 
going," Gretzky said. "That's when I knew I could control my destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"I did ask to go to Detroit or Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit, near Gretzky's hometown of Brantford, Ontario, had always been his 
sentimental favorite. Los Angeles meant Janet and lots of business 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when they were asking $15 million, the teams got narrowed down real 
quick," Gretzky said. "There were only two or three teams I could really end up 
with with that kind of a price tag. Detroit, New York and L.A. are about it." 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver offered Gretzky a lot of money, but he didn't see what he had to gain 
by going "an hour and a half west of Edmonton." The money, he said, didn't 
matter. He killed the deal right away. 
</P>
<P>
"I just said no," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
And Detroit didn't show Pocklington the kind of interest that Los Angeles 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
"That was when Bruce called me and told me that he had permission to talk to 
me," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between McNall and Pocklington went on for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jimmy Carson part held up things at least two weeks," McNall said. "At 
different times I thought maybe we could keep him. I thought they wanted to do 
the deal so badly, that I had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"But when (the story) started to leak, the opportunity of keeping him was less. 
The press, up there, began to get the story out and the response was coming in 
so strong it was almost an impossible thing. (The Oilers) were starting to get 
cold feet. So the Carson thing, we lost that." 
</P>
<P>
McNall offered Pocklington a reported $5 million to keep Carson out of the 
deal. McNall also offered more draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried everything, but they were just adamant about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At least he managed to hold onto Luc Robitaille. In the beginning, Edmonton had 
been asking for both Robitaille and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
McNall said he told the players in question what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy knew it. Luc knew it," he said. "They understood that if we were going 
to do this deal, we were going to have to give up something." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pocklington was trying to keep McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Glen Sather (Edmonton's coach and general manager) was not for the 
deal," McNall said. "He was never real supportive of the idea. I didn't really 
speak with him. He had resigned himself to doing it. But, again, he was adamant 
about not wanting Marty McSorley to be a part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very concerned that, somehow, (the deal) was going to be messed up. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"Pocklington was under a lot of pressure from all sides. I thought he was going 
to reconsider and say, 'Well, that's it.' He's the kind of guy who just might 
say, 'Forget about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough time because we were spending May and June getting ready for 
our (July 16) wedding," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough wedding because we had to try to satisfy not only friends and 
family, we had to satisfy fans, try to satisfy the media. We tried to make it 
accommodating for everyone. It was hard. We were working almost full-time on 
the wedding. My wife was pregnant. It was an emotional time. 
</P>
<P>
"The official date that I was traded was when we got the telex, about a week 
before it was announced. It wasn't supposed to be announced until about a week 
later than it was, but somehow it leaked out." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, McNall had called Gretzky while he was still on his honeymoon to tell 
him that the trade had been agreed upon. And McNall took the Gretzkys and some 
other friends out to dinner to celebrate in Los Angeles weeks before the Aug. 9 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McNall says he feared that a last-second glitch would negate the 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really believe it was going to happen until late the night before, I 
guess, Aug. 8, because we had gone around so often and it was so big, it's 
almost unrealistic to think that something like that is going to take place," 
he said. "I came to the point where, actually, I think the day of Aug. 8, I 
didn't really think it was going to happen at all. 
</P>
<P>
"So that night I said to Peter, 'Look, if it's going to happen, it's going to 
have to happen right now. If it's not, fine. But it's going to have to happen.' 
I thought if it continued to muddle on, especially the pressure of the press, 
with all the rumors, it would create such a huge stir up in Edmonton that it 
wouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the more we kept it dragging, the worse it would get. I thought we had 
to move on it now. I said, 'If you don't want the $15 million, fine.' That's 
tough for a guy to say no to. So he said, 'Fine.' I called Wayne and got that 
press conference thing set up real fast." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky said: "Bruce called me where I was staying at (entertainer) Alan 
Thicke's house at about 1:30 in the morning and told me that we had to be on a 
plane to Edmonton at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that I would have to sit down and talk with them (Pocklington and 
Sather). It was one of the things that my wife and I had talked about. As I've 
said, they were kind enough to let me go to L.A., and I was very appreciative 
for that. But after some of the things that had been said and done, there was 
no way, I just wouldn't have enjoyed myself playing hockey there." 
</P>
<P>
McNall was nervous about sending Gretzky into those meetings alone. After all, 
he had told Gretzky that if anything didn't feel right at the last minute, he 
could pull out. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky said: "I never wavered. I knew that Mr. McNall was nervous when I went 
in there, but I wasn't. I had no reason to think that anyone could talk me out 
of it. I think that by that point in time, I was way beyond coming back to 
Edmonton." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they traded me to L.A. thinking that (with this club) I wouldn't come 
back to haunt them," Gretzky said. "I think, in that, I was underestimated as a 
hockey player." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' record in their first year with Gretzky improved to 42-31-7. They 
went from 18th overall in the league to fourth, one point away from third 
place. They came from behind to knock the defending champion Oilers out of the 
playoffs before they lost to Calgary, which won the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The success was reflected at the box office, even before Gretzky had played a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The sellout for the Kings' opener last season was the team's first sellout of 
an opener. They went on to a record 25 sellouts and their average attendance 
increased from 11,667 to 14,875. And then they sold out all six playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
The trade that was a business deal turned out to be good business for the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
That's why McNall thought, from the start, that it would be only fair to offer 
Gretzky a share of the franchise that he was about to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not just a hockey player," McNall said. "For what he's done for our team? 
He's your partner. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, he's a player and he just wants to be a player. On the other 
hand, he's also a good friend. He's been there for us any time we needed him 
for anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, selling a sport that has hit the way it's hit here has demanded a 
lot of his time and his effort and a lot of his cooperation. We've become good 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"If Wayne Gretzky ever gets bored with this sport one day and decides not to 
play, until we've set up a tradition here, it could easily fall back to where 
it was before. So I treat him more like a partner. 
</P>
<P>
"If the league had permitted it on his contract deal, I had talked to him about 
a part of the franchise. And Wayne didn't want it. He just wants to be a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was right in thinking that the value of the franchise would increase 
enormously as a result of him. There is no other real reason for it. We can all 
speculate about the change of colors and all the nice things we've done here. 
The organization has done more to help promote the Kings. And that's certainly 
a percentage of it. But it's not a very high percentage of it. I'd say 99% of 
it is Gretzky." 
</P>
<P>
McNall considers Gretzky the catalyst for all the things that followed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Larry Robinsons and those kinds of things may not have happened," McNall 
said. "It would be a different team and it might be going in a different 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the general perception that McNall and Gretzky are such close 
buddies that Gretzky, more than General Manager Rogie Vachon, calls the shots? 
</P>
<P>
McNall said: "We do pal around. We do discuss things. But he will never 
volunteer something, like, 'I think we should get this guy for that guy.' Never 
once has that happened. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I do do, and what Rogie does, more than I do, is to ask him, for 
example, 'What do you think of Keith Crowder?' Or, 'Of the free agents 
available, who do you think will help our team the most?' If Rogie didn't do 
it, I'd be disappointed. And if I didn't do it, I'd be crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is, use every asset you possibly can. I also ask other players, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, you don't want to have so many cooks you mess up the soup. But when 
you have the greatest player that ever lived, you'd be nuts not to use his 
knowledge of the game." 
</P>
<P>
And when they don't all agree? McNall said he puts Gretzky's call ahead of his 
own, but puts Vachon's ahead of Gretzky's. 
</P>
<P>
As proof that Gretzky doesn't always get what he wants, McNall points out: "If 
that was the case, every Edmonton player would be here, one way or the other. . 
. . He's never in a situation where he asks that much. He just doesn't do that. 
He doesn't say, 'You've got to go out and get (Jari) Kurri, any way you can.' 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to him and say, 'We can get Kurri for this that and the other thing, 
what do you think?' he'll be honest. We've asked things about players he was 
friendly with, deals that I thought, emotionally, he might want, and he'll say, 
'No. That's too much.' " 
</P>
<P>
McNall values Vachon, he says, because Vachon knows how to follow protocol. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old style in hockey that says a GM does a certain job," McNall 
said. "Players, coaches, even owners to a certain extent, don't violate that 
area. A coach does a certain job. And those areas are inviolate. I don't 
believe in that. I'll listen to the press sometimes if I have to. I'll listen 
to a fan. It doesn't matter. I get input from all directions. . . . I listen. 
</P>
<P>
"But Rogie's authority is not in any way affected by it. I would have a 
personal problem with a GM who had to be so forceful and arrogant about his 
personal views of how things ought to be run that he didn't listen to anyone, 
whether it be an owner or whether it be Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, realistically, who's going to win that battle, if there was such a 
battle? I don't know how many GMs in this league sell tickets. I don't know how 
many owners sell tickets when you really come down to it. 
</P>
<P>
"So, the idea that Wayne runs the show, you'd be right to view things that way 
from the point of view that his influence is always going to be great." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is hoping that, in the coming season, the focus will shift away from 
him, at least a bit, as new issues draw the spotlight away from the trade. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh and Steve Yzerman of Detroit helped 
shift some of the attention. So did the big year that Gretzky's new teammate, 
Bernie Nicholls, had. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says that this season, the addition of some Soviet stars will capture 
the attention of a lot of NHL fans. And in Los Angeles, Gretzky will be glad to 
share center stage with Nicholls again. And with Larry Robinson, who has joined 
the Kings from the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
First, of course, Gretzky will have to deal with the flood of attention that 
will come with breaking the league scoring record, currently held by his idol, 
Gordie Howe. He needs 14 points to break Howe's mark of 1,850 points. 
</P>
<P>
McNall is hoping that the record goes in one of the first four games, so that 
it happens in the Forum for King fans. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says he would love to do it in Los Angeles, but he thinks it might be 
more realistic to expect to see it in the sixth game, which happens to be in 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
But if form holds, it's sure to happen early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was perfect last year, when I needed 182 points," Gretzky said. "It was so 
far away that no one really talked about it. Now, with 14 to go, it's so close. 
It will happen relatively quickly. We won't still be talking about it in 
November, December and January." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is also hoping that the Kings, as a contending team, will be worth some 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I always said that this is a sports city, and any time you have a sports city, 
give them something they like, and they'll support it," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
"People used to say to me, 'You're going down there and it's a basketball town. 
They have the Lakers.' Sure, they have the Lakers, and it's great to watch the 
champions. But I always tell people, 'There's another (pro basketball) team in 
town and they're only drawing 6,000. If it's such a great basketball town, why 
are they only drawing 6,000?' 
</P>
<P>
"People want to see winners. They come to watch and be entertained, see a team 
win. I knew if the Kings could put a winning atmosphere here and a positive 
attitude, we would do well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our team is much better right now than what we finished with. . . . 
Just five or six more wins than we had last year would be a big improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith Crowder will help us a lot. He'll give us a very solid checking line. . 
. . Larry (Robinson) will prove invaluable. He played well in the playoffs last 
year, and I'm sure he'll play the same way for us. More important, he'll be 
like a playing coach for our young defensemen. The two Swedish players that we 
signed, who have not been talked about, are going to help. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the depth Calgary had last year, but we stayed with them pretty 
well. . . . Rogie and Mr. McNall are the ones who spent the summer working, 
making sure the right people are here. . . . I think the team that comes out of 
this division will have as good a chance as any for the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings need to have that kind of a chance every year to develop fans. 
And the Kings need to have fans who are coming to see hockey, not just one 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build something that lasts," Gretzky said. "We don't want to 
have another season like last year and then two years from now drop back down. 
We want to build a foundation, build a following. Parents bringing their kids 
to games now, I hope 20 years from now, those kids will being bringing their 
kids. We need to build a relationship with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how teams change year to year." 
</P>
<P>
Like how the Kings changed between the playoffs of 1988 and the playoffs of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be tough year (last year), because it was a new thing 
and an exciting time for everyone," Gretzky said. "It's part of the game that 
you accept. Obviously, it's going to be a lot easier for me this year." 
</P>

GREEN SAYS HE EXPECTS TO BE FIRED AS YANKEE MANAGER BY STEINBRENNER

Dallas Green, criticized by the man he replaced as manager of the New York 
Yankees, says he expects to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question we're not going to be around long," Green was quoted as 
saying in Tuesday's editions of USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to owner George Steinbrenner, Green said: "This guy is not going to 
let us be around long. But that's all right. We're prepared for that." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, though, disputed any suggestion that he has been feuding with 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not really," he said. "I'm still supportive of my manager. All I said was 
if we're to win this thing and be right in the middle of it at the end, the 
players are going to have to play with the same intensity they showed in two 
games I saw recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is going to have to do better, and that includes the coaching staff. 
That's fact." 
</P>
<P>
Green also responded angrily to comments made Monday night on television by 
former Yankee manager Lou Piniella, who said center fielder Roberto Kelly 
should be moved higher in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
"Around here, everything is an affront," Green said Tuesday. "It goes with the 
territory. And he is well paid to affront. Lou's paid $400,000 to analyze. Let 
him analyze. But he's been in this situation before, so he knows he doesn't 
know the entire situation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really surprising, because I always thought that Lou was one of the 
class guys . . . "

LEONARD LETS HIS BAT DO THE TALKING WITH TWO HOMERS FOR THE MARINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
After hitting his second home run of the night, the eventual game-winner, 
Seattle Mariners designated hitter Jeffrey Leonard, a creative dancer when it 
comes to home run trots, made his way around the bases rather inconspicuously. 
</P>
<P>
There was no flap -- arm straight by his side, hand out -- or sling -- arm bent 
at his chest, fist closed. There was only Leonard trotting around the bases 
like anyone else would -- dullsville. 
</P>
<P>
That is until Leonard made his way around third. At that point, the trot 
stopped and the strut began. Slowly. Very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Fans booed and Angel reliever Greg Minton, who gave up the homer and would give 
up one to Darnell Coles four pitches later, looked something less than pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard's homers had far-reaching effects. The Angels' 6-4 loss to Seattle 
dropped them in a first-place tie with Oakland, which beat Chicago, 3-2, in 10 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, the homers were something for Leonard to savor. He has been in a 
home-run slump for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, whose 18 home runs and 72 RBIs lead the Mariners, had hit only one 
home run since June 27. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't seem ripe for change Tuesday as Leonard went against Bert 
Blyleven. Leonard was batting just .091 against Blyleven, with one hit in 11 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, he struck out looking. In the fourth, he hit a lazy pop 
fly to short. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth, with two on and the Mariners trailing, 4-1, Leonard hit a 
home run to left. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big hit for us," Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "Especially 
after the third inning." 
</P>
<P>
In the third, the Mariners got four hits and loaded the bases but came away 
with only one run when the Angels turned the rare, pitcher-to-catcher-to-first 
base double play. 
</P>
<P>
"After that happened I said, 'Oh no, here we go with another one of those 
nights,' " Lefebvre said. "Blyleven can be so tough on a ballclub. You need a 
big hit against him for that shot in the arm, something that lets your team 
know it can score runs off him." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Leonard came up in the 10th, Blyleven had been replaced by Minton. 
Leonard hit his first pitch over the right-field fence, giving the Mariners a 
5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see Jeffrey Leonard's bat back," Lefebvre said. "He can be a 
force, can't he?" 
</P>
<P>
No doubt. But he can also be very quiet when it comes to questions. In the same 
deliberate manner that he had made his way from third to home, Leonard walked 
toward his locker. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing, nothing, nothing,"' he said at the sight of a reporter preparing to 
ask a question, waving his hand as if to brush away a few gnats. 
</P>
<P>
That's about all Jeffrey Leonard had to say about his two home runs. Some guys 
can make it all look so easy.

COCHRANE CATCHES ON WITH THE MARINERS;

TROY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE SHOWING HIS VALUE AS A UTILITY PLAYER

<P>
Dave Cochrane's first venture into the major leagues lasted about a month in 
1986 with the Chicago White Sox. It was about as uneventful as it was short. 
</P>
<P>
He was a power-hitting third baseman in the White Sox minor league organization 
back then and earned a promotion to the big club at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the majors, he hit .191 with a home run and two RBIs in 62 at-bats. 
After that, the White Sox weren't in a hurry to give him another shot. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, Cochrane, a 1981 graduate of Troy High School in Fullerton, 
wasn't called up. 
</P>
<P>
And his fortunes didn't change immediately when he was traded to Seattle for 
pitcher Ken Spratke after the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was beginning to look as if Cochrane, 26, would be a career minor 
leaguer, he didn't get discouraged. Instead, he kept learning to play different 
positions, waiting and hoping. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frustrating, but I didn't want to give up," he said. "I was close 
enough to making it and I wasn't doing too badly in triple A so I kept trying." 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane finally was called up by the Mariners on May 1. But this time around, 
he had a lot more to offer than one position, a fluid swing and a strong 
throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he still plays third base. But that was just the start of his list of 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
He plays first, second, third, shortstop, catcher and the outfield. In short, 
he's become the Mariners' utility player. Being a switch-hitter adds even more 
to his versatility. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives me great flexibility," said Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre. "The first 
thing you want to do is make the majors, then the key to sticking is showing 
that you can do a lot of things. Dave has done that. . . . He's very valuable 
to this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane is used mainly as a late-inning replacement and pinch-hitter by the 
Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
He is hitting .308 (four for 13) as a pinch-hitter with two RBIs. He's hitting 
.219 overall with three doubles, a triple, three home runs and 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Catching was the final position Cochrane added early this season while playing 
for Calgary, Seattle's triple-A team. He was the last cut in spring training 
and the Mariners asked him to work out behind the plate in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
He had caught some with the White Sox, but rarely in a game. He was drafted as 
a third baseman by the New York Mets and turned down a scholarship to Arizona 
State to sign. Cochrane was traded from the Mets to the White Sox in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He made his major league catching debut last week when the Mariners played the 
Angels in Seattle. He has played all five infield positions and left field in a 
little more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I wasn't catching. I was more of a backstop and not a very good 
one," Cochrane joked. "But I'm getting better. I'll do whatever it takes to 
stay here. Jim Lefebvre has given me a chance and I want to really take 
advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our coaches, Rusty Kuntz, gave me a great piece of advice. Even the 
worst day in the minors is better than the best day in triple A." 
</P>
<P>
From almost the day he was called up, Cochrane has been teased by teammate Mike 
Schooler, a relief pitcher with 22 saves. 
</P>
<P>
They played together nine seasons ago on a Babe Ruth League 16-18-year-old 
all-star team. Back then, Cochrane was limited to pitching and playing a little 
third base while Schooler played shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I always tease him about," Schooler said. "I tell them (his 
teammates) that I played short and Dave didn't. Now here he is still trying to 
make it as a shortstop." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cochrane: "He talks about that all the time. He always tells everyone that 
he played shortstop and I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Cochrane doesn't worry much about where he plays now; he's just happy to be 
playing in the major leagues.

ELI HAYDEL OF LOUISIANA, EXPERT WATERFOWL HUNTER, LIKES TO TOOT HIS OWN HORNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Perry Webb, a duck hunter from Fullerton, went to Eli Haydel with a serious 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having trouble with the quack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of call are you using?" Haydel asked Webb, who named the brand. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well," Haydel said, reaching into a valise. "That doesn't sound like a 
duck. That's for calling judges." 
</P>
<P>
Haydel then produced one of the 60-some calls for waterfowl and big game he 
manufactures at his factory in Bossier City, La., near Shreveport in the 
northwest corner of the state. 
</P>
<P>
He gave it a few toots -- QUAA-aack, quack-quack-quack-quack -- and, sure 
enough, not a single judge came running. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference in calling ducks and calling judges," Haydel told Webb. 
"It's a matter of being fancy and catching the judge's ear . . . like on a hail 
call, they hit about 40 notes. You don't do that in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Haydel has done both successfully -- partial evidence being nearly 100 trophies 
he and his sons have won in various calling contests from local to world class. 
</P>
<P>
Ducks are his game, but Haydel also wears a brass manhole cover for a belt 
buckle since winning the Gueydan International Goose Calling contest. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed: "If it can be called, I can come up with a call for it." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Haydel was wishing he could come up with a call for people. A 
scheduled seminar under a canopy at this year's Raahauge's Shooting and Fishing 
Sports Fair at Norco wasn't drawing. 
</P>
<P>
So Haydel, 49, sat patiently and waited, which is what duck hunting is about, 
and chain-smoked cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, over Memorial Day weekend, he had a heart attack, then a triple 
bypass several days later. He doesn't smoke anymore, which is costing the 
tobacco companies about a grand a year. It could also be bad news for ducks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up to three packs a day, but I haven't had one since I left the 
hospital," Haydel said. "I'll probably have more power for calling now." 
</P>
<P>
At Raahauge's, as Haydel demonstrated calls for a few serious hunters, 
passers-by became curious about the strange noises. 
</P>
<P>
Quack. Cluck. Squawk. Squeak. Yodel. 
</P>
<P>
 Several were attracted, just like ducks, and soon there was a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't call every duck you see," Haydel told them. "Even a live duck 
won't." 
</P>
<P>
Haydel found his calling growing up in Cajun country southwest of New Orleans. 
He learned the art from Amos Faulk and other legends of the Bayou, which is 
along the Mississippi Flyway -- one of the country's four major migration 
routes and winter habitats for waterfowl. If you can call ducks in Louisiana, 
Haydel believes, you can call ducks anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the callers down in Louisiana are far superior, because the ducks are 
getting shot at all the way down (from Canada)," he said. "By the time they get 
to Louisiana, you've got to be a good caller. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a style of callin' in Louisiana known as the squeal style. The old 
market hunters made their calls out of cane. The reeds were made out of Ace 
hard-rubber combs. Their thinking was that when ducks were feeding in the rice 
fields or the marsh, the rice would cause their vocal cords to be restricted 
and they'd emit this hoarse squeal at the end of each note." 
</P>
<P>
Haydel has made a call to imitate the mournful cry, which sounds like a duck 
whose voice is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"When ducks were flying over and heard this sound, they'd be attracted because 
they knew there were groceries below," Haydel said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes ducks aren't the only ones fooled. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hunting on a ranch once," Haydel said. "A guy crawled up and shot my 
decoys." 
</P>
<P>
Haydel's reputation also has put him on the spot. When he was in the Air Force 
-- a clerk typist in Intelligence -- a couple of colonels asked him to take 
them hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"This was in the early '60s, when redheads were illegal to shoot," Haydel said. 
"Needless to say, a couple flew over and one of the colonels dropped both of 
them before I could say, 'Don't shoot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Haydel quickly retrieved the birds, cut off their heads and announced, 'Look 
here, Colonel, a nice brace of greater scaup. I cut the heads off so they'll 
bleed out.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, when Haydel and his sons already had won several contests, the 
president of their local duck club organized an impromptu contest to decide who 
had the best method of attracting ducks. 
</P>
<P>
"They had me call first," Haydel said. "No applause. Next, my sons. Still no 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the president stepped up and said, 'My turn.' He reached into his pocket 
and threw a handful of corn across the floor. Everyone applauded." 
</P>
<P>
Baiting is illegal. Last year in Texas, next door to Haydel's home hunting 
grounds, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service climaxed a three-year undercover 
sting operation by busting 40 private hunting establishments for baiting and 
other waterfowl hunting violations. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave everybody a black eye," Haydel said. 
</P>
<P>
Duck populations on the Mississippi Flyway are down considerably, anyway, 
because of recent dry years. Many longtime hunters -- Haydel included -- have 
become conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
But on the most productive day he ever had, he shot 67 ducks. 
</P>
<P>
"I overdid it. In those days I thought I had to kill every duck I called. Now, 
once I've got a duck at the 25-, 30-yard line, as far as I'm concerned it's 
over. I don't have to shoot it. I've shot my share of game. I want to have duck 
hunting for my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Haydel is content to sell his calls and teach the art to others. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the guys to practice in the car, because it usually drives the wives 
nuts," he said. "They're the ones that get the funny looks, driving down the 
road with a duck call in their mouth, quackin' away." 
</P>
<P>
Game calls are like musical instruments. Different types produce different 
sounds. Haydel credits a musical ear for his success in developing various 
kinds. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a background in music from when I was 14 . . . play saxophone by ear, 
so I'm able to pick up sounds, the rhythm and the tempo of wild game." 
</P>
<P>
His deer grunt call has won acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
"A buck deer grunts when he's calling a doe in heat. If a big buck is in a 
thicket and he hears that sound in his territory, he'll think some rival is 
after one of his girlfriends and he'll come out to run him off." 
</P>
<P>
He also makes calls for elk, bears, javelina, rabbits, crows, quail, squirrels, 
raccoons and turkeys. Turkeys are the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
"Their hearing and eyesight are 10 times better than ours," Haydel said. "I've 
shot 'em with a bow at 10 yards, but if they could smell we'd never kill 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Who needs game calls? Why not just use tape recorders? 
</P>
<P>
"It's illegal," Haydel said. "They've done it with snow geese -- and a lot of 
guys have gotten caught." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the game is to fool the creature honestly. That's the primary appeal 
it has for Haydel now. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't apologizing when he says his plastic calls "are the least expensive on 
the market," from $5.95 for a BQ-84 Bob White Quail to $22.95 for an MEB-85 
Magnum Elk Bugle. 
</P>
<P>
"This call here is $19.95," Haydel said, displaying a GF-88 Goose Flute. A 
wooden call in that model could cost you as much as $150." 
</P>
<P>
Some purists put down plastic calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but when a wood call gets wet it swells," Haydel said. "And when it 
swells, it changes that arc, that radius, (and) it's going to change the squeak 
and the squawk." 
</P>
<P>
But Haydel also knows that some sportsmen would rather have the more expensive 
item, even if it doesn't work as well. Human nature. 
</P>
<P>
For them, Haydel sells Diamond Wood Mallard and Diamond Wood Goose calls for 
$34.95. 
</P>
<P>
They probably impress the judges, if not the ducks.

Saying he didn't hit anyone, Deion Sanders filed a counterclaim of assault 
against a fan he says was harassing his girlfriend during a minor league 
baseball game in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who plays with the New York Yankees' Columbus (Ohio) farm team in the 
International League and also is the Atlanta Falcons' first-round draft choice, 
was arrested Sunday on misdemeanor charges of assault for allegedly striking 
two fans. He denied hitting either man and said one of them took a gold chain 
from his girlfriend's neck. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred six days before Sanders was scheduled to go off probation 
in a battery and disorderly conduct case in Florida. His probation officer said 
he is considering whether to charge Sanders with violating the conditions of 
his probation.

Less than six months after saying he was trying to rid himself of drugs, George 
Gervin, the former pro basketball star, was arrested on charges of possession 
of marijuana and driving while intoxicated in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Gervin, 37, was stopped after seen speeding and weaving on Interstate 410 in 
north-central San Antonio about 2:30 a.m. He was released on a personal 
recognizance bond shortly after 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Driving a black 1985 Porsche, Gervin was said to be traveling at 66 m.p.h. in a 
55-m.p.h. zone, according to sheriff's department reports. A substance believed 
to be marijuana was found in his possession, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the former National Basketball Assn. All-Star was treated 
for what police said was an apparent drug overdose. According to a police 
report in that February incident, Gervin said he snorted what he thought was 
cocaine, but later said he did not know what the substance was.

Charles White, formerly a running back with the Rams and USC, discussed his 
cocaine use at a California Commission on Drugs hearing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
White said he was finally clean for the past nine months after years of nearly 
daily cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to die; it got that bad one time," White testified. "I 
asked myself, 'When are you going to give in? When you've got a tag around your 
toe in the morgue?' " 
</P>
<P>
White, who has been working with other addicts at a Long Beach hospital, said 
it would be helpful for professional teams to have a recovered addict on staff 
to council players.

NEWPORT ELECTRONICS CHAIRMAN TO SELL STAKE TO EASTERN INVESTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Newport Electronics Inc. Chairman Barret B. Weekes plans to sell his 18.6% 
stake in the Santa Ana company to a Connecticut investor, spurning the 
recommendation of Newport's board to accept a buyout proposal from a Silicon 
Valley firm. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Electronics said Tuesday that Weekes informed the company he will 
tender his 214,722 shares to High Technology Holding Corp., a company headed by 
Milton B. Hollander, who has offered to pay $11 per share for 35% of Newport's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's board recently rejected Hollander's offer in favor of a tender offer 
and merger proposal from Sensor Control Corp., a Sunnyvale firm. Sensor has 
offered to buy 43% of Newport's stock for $9.75 per share, and to buy the 
remaining shares for $9 each in a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Norman Gray, a company director, said that he and his wife will 
also tender their 69,356 shares, or 6% stake, to Hollander's firm. DAVID OLMOS

COUNTY-BASED MAZDA AND HYUNDAI RATED AMONG BEST IN AUTO SATISFACTION SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two car companies that have U.S. headquarters in Orange County -- Mazda and 
Hyundai -- ranked among the best in an annual survey of customer satisfaction 
among new-car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, released this week by J.D. Power &amp; Associates, amounts to a 
report card for domestic, Japanese and European autos. The Agoura Hills 
marketing research firm scores the makes according to customer satisfaction for 
both product quality and dealer service over the first 12 months of car 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the Power survey is one of the most influential in the auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average Jumps 10 Points 
</P>
<P>
J.D. Power asked more than 24,000 owners of 1988 models about 16 categories 
ranging from satisfaction with the dealer to mechanical problems and vehicle 
repair. The survey ranks 158 models of 35 makes, or nameplates. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 survey, the industry average -- for domestic, Japanese and European 
autos -- was 118, a whopping 10-point jump above last year's industry average. 
On one hand, the increase in the average score is good news: It means that 
satisfaction levels have gone up over time. But on the other hand, 
manufacturers can also expect that "customer satisfaction will also rise -- so 
it will be more difficult to maintain those high levels of satisfaction," said 
William Fleming, an account executive with J.D. Power. 
</P>
<P>
Among manufacturers with operations in Orange County, Mazda got the highest 
marks. The Japanese company, which has U.S. headquarters in Irvine, ranked No. 
8 with a score of 125 -- an eight-point jump from the 1988 score of 117. 
</P>
<P>
In comments released with the survey, J.D. Power states, "Mazda's people skills 
improved dramatically to move above the industry average. . . . (The) vehicle 
repair/reliability score stayed relatively constant, but remained above the 
industry average. The problem-at-delivery level continues to be below the 
industry average. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The proportion of owners indicating they are 'very satisfied' with dealers . . 
. and their overall ownership experience are both significantly higher than the 
industry average." 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai, a South Korean company with U.S. headquarters in Garden Grove, ranked 
No. 14 with a score of 119, one point above the industry average. That meant 
that Hyundai dropped from its 13th-place slot on last year's rankings, even 
though its score climbed by seven points. 
</P>
<P>
In comments on the survey, J.D. Power states that Hyundai's customer handling 
skills are about equal to last year's. "However, the improving industry average 
put the nameplate under the total industry average" compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Others in Top 25 
</P>
<P>
"Hyundai's slightly improved repair/reliability performance did not keep up 
with the gains made by the total industry," the survey continues. "Both 
problems during the warranty period and service delays due to lack of parts are 
below the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
"Owners' satisfaction with their new vehicles and their ownership experience 
remain well below the industry averages. . . . However, Hyundai owners were 
more likely to indicate they are 'very satisfied' with dealers selling their 
make and their overall ownership experience than were Hyundai owners in the 
1988 survey." 
</P>
<P>
Two other Japanese companies with U.S. headquarters in Orange County -- 
Daihatsu and Mitsubishi -- were ranked by J.D. Power among the top 25. 
</P>
<P>
Daihatsu tied with two other manufacturers for 17th place, scoring 117, one 
point below the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
The car, which was introduced in January, 1988, scored lower in the 
service-advisory categories and "very high" in the product categories, said 
C.R. Brown, chief operating officer with Los Alamitos-based Daihatsu American 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Those scores translate to customers that are unhappy with treatment at the 
dealership, particularly with the apparent lack of knowledge on the part of 
service managers who write up repair orders at dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that because the Daihatsu is a new product, all of its dealerships 
are new. So when the survey was completed, "many of our dealers had just been 
in business 30, 60 or 90 days. It takes time to get fully trained and 
indoctrinated on the product. . . . We'll improve as service advisers have more 
experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daihatsu got high marks in the J.D. Power IQS survey, which measures problems 
encountered by customers in the first 90 days of ownership. That separate 
survey, which was released in June, ranked Daihatsu above average with fewer 
problems per 100 vehicles than the industry average. The industry average was 
153 problems per 100 cars. 
</P>
<P>
In the car satisfaction survey, meanwhile, Mitsubishi, was ranked 21st -- a 
drop from last year's No. 18 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
In that survey, Mitsubishi scored 112, six points below the industry average of 
118. Even so, the score marks an improvement over last year when the 
manufacturer scored 109 on an industry average of 108. 
</P>
<P>
"We dropped slightly this year because the entire industry is moving ahead," 
said Tom Benson, Mitsubishi's vice president of service. Kim Custer, a 
spokesman with Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, added that 
Mitsubishi will soon announce a "comprehensive effort" to improve overall 
customer satisfaction.

COSTA MESA CREATES AGENCY TO PROMOTE ARTS, TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council voted early Tuesday to create a new agency intended 
to provide continuous, stable funding for the arts and tourism that city 
officials say could substantially increase cultural subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
At a regular meeting, the City Council voted unanimously to establish the Costa 
Mesa Tourism, Arts and Promotion Council, a nonprofit public corporation to be 
run by a five-member volunteer board of Costa Mesa residents yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident we can come up with (a structure for the corporation) that one, 
promotes hotel-motel business, and two, provides greater support for the arts," 
Mayor Peter F. Buffa said at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole intent of this was not to have arts grants dependent on what we can 
squeeze out of the general fund and to increase arts funding," he added in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Even while sharing funds with the tourism industry, the agency, initially 
conceived to address a rise in requests for arts subsidies, "will amount to 
substantially more for the arts," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
Current municipal arts subsidies are generated through a 6% transient occupancy 
tax, also known as a bed tax, imposed on hotel and motel guests. These monies 
however, drawn from the city's general fund, are subject to spending 
restrictions imposed by the 1979 Gann initiative. These tax revenues are also 
used to fund other city expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the new agency is to be raised through a proposed 6% 
visitor-service fee that would replace the hotel bed tax. This money will not 
be part of the general fund and would therefore be free from Gann-initiative 
restrictions and would be earmarked exclusively for arts and tourism, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's fee could generate as much money as the hotel bed tax does 
annually, Buffa said. Last year, bed-tax revenues from 36 area hotels totaled 
more than $2 million, and city arts grants to 11 groups and one cultural event 
totaled $159,000, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A vote to establish the visitor-service fee is scheduled for Aug. 21. Revenues 
from the fee would have to benefit the tourist industry, but details about how 
these revenues will be used -- if indeed the fee is enacted -- have not been 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
Once the visitor-service fee is resolved, the agency will not be in operation 
for at least one month, the time it will take to have its nonprofit status 
certified by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Monday postponed a vote to determine critical details of how the 
overall agency will function, such as what sorts of cultural events or groups 
will be funded, after arts administrators voiced worries that its initial 
guidelines were too vague or did not sufficiently stress support for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"The arts are addressed in the title of the agency, but nowhere else" in the 
guidelines, said Debra L. Steckel, annual fund director for South Coast 
Repertory. "We would like to see that more specifically addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Mary Hornbuckle agreed: "My understanding was that the intent of the 
corporation was to provide a continuous, stable source of arts funding. But 
(the guidelines) could mean almost anything." 
</P>
<P>
The new agency won backing from hotel representatives during Monday night's 
marathon meeting that stretched past 2:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very encouraging to see the council put forth funding and support for 
arts and tourism," said Michael J. Deighton, general manager of the Westin 
South Coast Plaza hotel.

The Times incorrectly reported on Aug. 9 that the Costa Mesa City Council voted

GARDEN GROVE CONCERT COSTS UNDER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to save money, a Garden Grove official has urged the city to 
replace subsidized performances by the Garden Grove Symphony with free concerts 
by military bands. 
</P>
<P>
However, a military spokesman says regulations prohibit Navy bands from 
competing with civilian groups. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Robert F. Dinsen was the lone dissenter when the council 
recently voted 4 to 1 to allocate $16,000 to support the orchestra's fifth 
annual free summer concert on the Village Green, Aug. 19. At that July 24 
meeting, Dinsen asked the city staff to explore the possibility of using 
military bands to play future concerts in the park at no cost to the city. 
Dinsen also opposed an additional $14,000 to support the orchestra for the 
fiscal year which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the past two years, military groups have presented free concerts at 
the Don Walsh Auditorium, said city spokesman John Bushman. Both the U.S. Navy 
Band, based in Washington, and the Commodores, the Navy's jazz ensemble, came 
to the city, Bushman said.

"If we can get them for free, and if people enjoy them, why should we waste 
$16,000?" Dinsen wondered in an interview. The councilman, who opposes all 
municipal support for the arts, including the annual Grove Shakespeare 
Festival, complained that the Garden Grove Symphony's overhead has grown too 
much.

"They use too many union musicians," he said. "They're overloaded with 
professionals." 
</P>
<P>
However, according to Chief Petty Officer Stephen Evans, a spokesman for the 
U.S. Navy Band in San Diego, military groups are prohibited from replacing an 
organization of professional musicians. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Evans said, military bands are "limited to (performing) 
patriotic programs as opposed to pure entertainment." More specifically, Evans 
said, the Navy's manual of public policy states that "military musicians will 
not be placed nor place themselves in competition with civilian musicians." 
Replacing the orchestra in Garden Grove concerts, Evans said, appeared to fall 
into that category. 
</P>
<P>
Union and orchestra officials said they were not opposed to military concerts 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no argument with anything that doesn't replace a paid performance," 
said Robert W. Stava, secretary treasurer of Orange County Musicians Assn., 
Local No. 7, which represents members of the Garden Grove Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi, marketing director for the orchestra, said that, while 
"there is nothing wrong with a military band coming down here . . . I think the 
city should always take pride in their own creativity -- the (Grove) 
Shakespeare Festival, the Gem Theatre and the symphony -- the unique things 
that the town has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the Village Green concert, Dvir-Djerassi said, is $27,000. 
The orchestra will pay the difference.

Marvin Mitchelson -- A headline Friday incorrectly stated that attorney Marvin 
Mitchelson was absolved by a jury who heard a malpractice lawsuit filed against 
him by Felicia Gordon. The jury found that Mitchelson failed to use ordinary 
care and skill in handling her divorce case but it concluded that she was not 
damaged by his actions. The jury also found that Mitchelson did not 
intentionally or negligently inflict emotional distress on Gordon.
