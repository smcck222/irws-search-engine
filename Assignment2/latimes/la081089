PRO-CHOICE FORCES TAKE CREDIT FOR VICTORY IN 76TH

<P>
Drawing battle lines likely to be seen in elections nationwide next year, 
abortion rights advocates claimed credit Wednesday for a pro-choice 
Republican's narrow victory in a special state Assembly contest that 
demonstrated anew the volatile issue's political potency. 
</P>
<P>
In a result widely viewed as proof of the political fallout of last month's U. 
S. Supreme Court abortion ruling, Tricia Hunter, the only pro-choice Republican 
in an eight-candidate field, had a razor-thin 197-vote lead over Poway 
businessman Dick Lyles -- 14,822 to 14,625 -- with only 132 absentee ballots 
remaining to be counted today. 
</P>
<P>
Because no candidate received more than 50% in the primary, Hunter will face 
Democrat Jeannine Correia, who is also pro-choice, in an Oct. 3 runoff to 
select a successor to the late Bill Bradley (R-Escondido). By virtue of 
Republicans' 54%-33% registration edge, Hunter, a 37-year-old registered nurse 
from Bonita, is a prohibitive favorite to win the runoff in the 76th District, 
a rural and suburban expanse stretching from the South Bay to northeastern San 
Diego County and into southern Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative District 
</P>
<P>
With Tuesday's primary being among the first legislative contests in the nation 
since the Supreme Court gave the states new powers to regulate abortions, both 
sides hoped to use the outcome for public-relations purposes as they prepare 
for next year's state and national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice forces were particularly enthused over the prospect of capturing a 
seat in a staunchly conservative district, and lost no time Wednesday in 
characterizing Hunter's victory as a message to politicians across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that a clear, articulate statement supporting a woman's right to 
decide was a plus in a district where no one ever thought it could be," said 
Robin Schneider, a director of California Abortion Rights Action League. "The 
(abortion) issue clearly differentiated Tricia Hunter from her opponents, and 
the voters responded." 
</P>
<P>
But Brian Johnston, California director of the National Right to Life 
Committee, an anti-abortion group, described Hunter's win as a "Pyrrhic 
victory" made possible by Democratic crossover votes and the support of 
"ultra-liberal" groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
"They have spent a lot of money to buy that seat, and in order to keep it, 
they're going to have to keep on spending that money," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
As they had throughout the campaign, anti-abortion groups discouraged 
interpretation of Hunter's slim victory as an up-or-down vote on the emotional 
issue. However, they encouraged Lyles to wage a write-in campaign in October or 
else run against Hunter in next June's regular GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of whether it was a referendum, the abortion lobby caused it to be 
seen that way," said Jeannette Dreisbach of Palm Springs, legislative director 
of the California Pro-Life Medical Assn. "And to be left with a choice between 
Hunter and Correia leaves us with no choice at all. Once Mr. Lyles gets over 
being bummed out, I think he'll realize that a write-in campaign would have a 
good chance of succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles' campaign aides said Wednesday that he will not decide whether to request 
a recount or about a possible write-in campaign until the election results are 
certified by the secretary of state's office, probably early next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tailor-Made for Hunter 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of abortion as a pivotal issue in the campaign's final month, 
combined with the unusual rules governing special legislative primaries -- in 
which all candidates of all parties appear on a single ballot -- created a race 
that was tailor-made for the Hunter campaign. Not only did most Republican 
officeholders split their support between two of her opponents -- Lyles and 
Poway City Councilwoman Linda Brannon -- but anti-abortion groups also failed 
to coalesce around a single candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice groups, looking to add a vote for their side in the closely divided 
Assembly, took maximum advantage of their unusual opportunity to gain an ally 
from normally unfriendly political territory. 
</P>
<P>
The Abortion Rights Action League, for example, organized an effort to identify 
pro-choice voters -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- and urged them to vote 
for Hunter. The group eventually contacted about 5,300 voters, Schneider said, 
in a project that will serve as a model for the group's affiliates across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The National Organization for Women's California chapter also supported Hunter, 
contributing $3,000 to her campaign and sending letters to its members in the 
district on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that the pro-choice vote is out there, even in the most 
conservative districts, and it can be mobilized," said Linda Joplin, statewide 
coordinator of California NOW. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, a two-term member of the state Board of Registered Nursing, also 
enjoyed strong support from the California Nurses Assn., which poured about 
$96,000 into an independent campaign on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the abortion issue as a "major factor" in her victory, Hunter noted 
that it served as a magnet for campaign contributions and volunteers and 
generated intense media coverage, including reports by four national television 
networks, that produced a meteoric rise in her name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd give (it) very much credit for helping me win this race," Hunter said. 
Hunter mailers that were targeted to pro-choice voters also framed the race in 
terms of the stakes on the abortion issue, such as one headlined: "Who controls 
your body? You or far-right extremists?" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hunter disputed some of her opponents' efforts to portray her as 
a one-issue candidate, saying: "I ran an issue-oriented campaign on a lot of 
issues, not just abortion. We were getting support because of my other 
positions before abortion even became an issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Issue Counted 
</P>
<P>
Most of Hunter's opponents argued that, in the absence of the abortion issue, 
Hunter probably would have ended the campaign where she began it -- mired in 
the middle of the pack along with several other credible but unknown candidates 
in an otherwise obscure campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"That issue made Tricia Hunter," said Bob Schuman, Lyles' campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Williams, the campaign consultant of Poway Councilwoman Brannon, who was 
viewed at the outset as one of the co-favorites but faded to a fourth-place 
finish, said his polling showed that Hunter's support nearly tripled in the 
week after the Supreme Court's July 3 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"Take away that, and Hunter would not have been a viable candidate," Williams 
said. "Until then, it was going to be a Lyles-Brannon race. After abortion 
became an issue, it never was." 
</P>
<P>
Brannon was seriously hurt in the race, Williams argued, by her 
"pro-responsibility" position, which combined her personal opposition to 
abortion with a willingness to support abortions under more limited 
circumstances than they are now available. 
</P>
<P>
"What that meant was that Linda was in the middle and satisfied no one," 
Williams said. "She wasn't pure enough to pass either side's litmus test." 
</P>
<P>
Concurring with that analysis, Hunter said: "The lesson of this race is that 
people are going to have to take a position on this issue. Voters expect 
candidates to come down on one side or the other, and aren't going to respond 
to people who try to stay in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
The election's outcome also bore out anti-abortion activists' worst fears that, 
with their resources -- financial, manpower and votes -- split among several 
Republicans, Hunter's pro-choice position left her in a strategically 
advantageous position from which she could attract support from both moderate 
Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what we were afraid of, and that's what happened," said the 
Rev. Billy Falling, head of the Escondido-based Christian Voters League, a 
fundamentalist religious and political organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunter basically had one side of the field to herself," Brannon strategist 
Williams said. "The pro-choicers could coalesce behind one candidate without 
offending anyone. But the pro-life support went in at least three directions." 
</P>
<P>
Although estimates of the crossover Democratic votes received by Hunter are 
based more on educated guesswork than hard numbers, political arithmetic 
suggests that the total might have been substantial. 
</P>
<P>
If the election's overall 20% turnout figure held accurate for Democrats, about 
15,000 of the district's 78,284 Democrats went to the polls. However, the two 
Democrats in the primary -- Correia, an instructor of the retarded, and county 
mental health worker Stephen Thorne -- drew only about 4,500 votes between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
That differential raised interesting theories Wednesday about where the other 
10,000-plus Democratic votes might have gone. Even if the Democratic turnout 
was only 10%, that still would have produced more than 3,000 votes beyond the 
two Democrats' combined total. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's pro-choice stance and other positions -- notably, her strong support 
for a ban on the sale of assault rifles -- left her well-positioned to attract 
those crossover votes, Williams argued. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any doubt that a big chunk of Hunter's votes came from 
Democrats," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, noting that Brannon also made a mailed appeal to Democrats, said she 
"cannot even make a wild guess" at a breakdown of the crossover vote. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows exactly where their votes came from, or whether they came from 
Republicans or Democrats or independents," Hunter said. "All I know is that I 
got the most total votes. And that's what counts."

It would have been a taxing feat even for the most fit, but an undaunted 
Camelia Popescu Sorina put aside her condition -- 9 months pregnant -- in 
choosing to flee her native Romania. She rode down the Danube River on an inner 
tube and then hiked six more miles to escape into Yugoslavia. As it turned out, 
she made it with only hours to spare. Shortly after she reached Yugoslavia, 
Sorina boarded a bus for Belgrade, at which point she went into labor, the 
magazine Ilustrovana Politika reported. The 30-year-old teacher was taken to a 
hospital in Negotin, where she gave birth to a girl. Sorina's husband, 
Alexander, earlier had escaped Romania via Hungary to Austria, where he is 
living in a refugee camp. A friend who fled with him was shot to death by 
soldiers as he tried to swim the Danube. The couple now want either to go to 
Canada or to settle in Austria, the magazine said.

 -- Among the privileges of being vice president are horseback rides in a 
national park, but it's a practice that has one former park historian up in 
arms. Dan Quayle and his three children -- Tucker, 15, Benjamin, 12, and 
Corinne, 10 -- are regular visitors to Manassas National Battlefield Park in 
Virginia, where they choose their mounts from a string of nine horses not 
available to the general public. That's got former park staffer John Hennessey, 
now with the New York state Division of Parks, steamed -- mostly, he says, 
because he has seen other services at the park cut back over the years. "You 
have money going into maintaining these government horses . . . while anyone 
can see the woeful condition of the rest of the operation. What type of message 
does that send to the public?" Hennessey asked. Ed Raus, who heads the 
battlefield's interpretive staff, said: "This is the worst year in the three 
years I've been here. We don't have the staff to operate the programs we once 
did."

 -- The Twain shall meet, after all, in Elmira, N. Y., this weekend, as about 
150 scholars and experts on the writer Mark Twain get together to jaw about one 
of his darker works, "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court." Marianne 
Curling, curator of the Mark Twain Memorial in Hartford, Conn., said that while 
"A Connecticut Yankee" was not Twain's most successful work, today it is among 
his most relevant. "It talks about the impact of technology in society," she 
said. "People either thought electricity would cure the ills of society or 
destroy it. It's very much like people regard nuclear power today." The novel 
chronicles the journey back in time of Hank Morgan, a New England mechanic, to 
6th-Century England. ANN CONNORS

MORRIS SHENKER, 82; HOFFA ATTORNEY, EX-DUNES OWNER

<P>
Morris Shenker, an attorney best known for representing Teamster boss Jimmy 
Hoffa, and a former owner of the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas has died, it was 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for his firm said Shenker, 82, who had recently undergone heart 
surgery and who wore a pacemaker, died Tuesday night in Santa Monica, where he 
had been visiting his daughter. He had been hospitalized briefly for pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Shenker, a Russian immigrant who grew up in north St. Louis, first made a name 
for himself as a young lawyer by doing free legal work for the poor and getting 
involved in Democratic politics. 
</P>
<P>
He had been recurrently in the national spotlight since representing gambling 
figures before the Estes Kefauver hearings on organized crime in the early 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffa, his most famous client, had links to organized crime and disappeared in 
1975. He is presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his Teamsters connection, Shenker, who operated the Dunes Hotel and 
Casino in the 1970s, ran afoul of the Nevada Gaming Commission. (Shenker's name 
had also surfaced often in connection with loans from the Teamsters Pension 
Fund.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite state and federal investigations, however, Shenker escaped indictment 
until this year. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a federal grand jury accused him of conspiring to conceal hundreds 
of thousands of dollars from the Internal Revenue Service and bankruptcy 
creditors. The money supposedly was diverted from a California partnership 
owned by his children to individuals in Canada and then back to Shenker's 
secretary in Las Vegas in an elaborate scheme to avoid creditors. Shenker 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Shenker had filed for bankruptcy in 1984 after a $34-million court verdict 
against him for money he borrowed from the Culinary Workers Pension Fund for 
resorts in Southern California and other projects. He had been involved in 
court battles over his finances ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include a daughter, a son and two granddaughters.

MOTHER, SON, FRIEND FOUND SLAIN AT 3 CLAIREMONT SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL and IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writers

<P>
A woman, her 3-year-old son and a male acquaintance were found dead Wednesday 
at three separate locations along a 22-block stretch of busy Clairemont Mesa 
Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
All three victims suffered unspecified "trauma," police said. More specific 
information on the injuries was not available late Wednesday, and details about 
the killings were generally sketchy. The bodies were found within 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, there is no motive and no suspect," said Bill Robinson, a San 
Diego police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson confirmed, however, that police believe the three slayings are linked. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official confirmation of the victims' identity by late Wednesday, 
although friends of the dead woman identified her readily as a mother of two 
who lived in the house where she was found. Police said she knew the male 
victim, believed to be in his late 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents said the neighborhood, although busy, had not been a high-crime 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like that has ever happened here," said Chandra Urbina, a neighbor. 
"My heart is going a hundred miles an hour. I got four kids in (my house). And 
now this." 
</P>
<P>
The man's body was found first, in an alley off the 3200 block of Clairemont 
Mesa Boulevard shortly before 11 a.m., police said, adding that he had injuries 
to his upper body and was found by a man walking his dog. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:41 p.m., police said, two passers-by found the body of the 3-year-old, 
who was clad in pajamas. He was wrapped in a blanket or bedspread and lying in 
a carport behind a building in the 5400 block of Clairemont Mesa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor found the woman's body at 2:32 p.m., police said, after the neighbor 
had stopped by for a visit. The dead woman was in the back bedroom of the 
house, and a window had been broken, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After word of the slayings spread, shocked neighbors and acquaintances gathered 
on the street outside the woman's home in the 4300 block of Clairemont Mesa 
Boulevard, forming a makeshift vigil and voicing disbelief that she was gone. 
The home is across the street from a Presbyterian church and preschool. 
</P>
<P>
She "was really a nice girl," said Conny Stangel, who said she knew the dead 
woman well. "She had a lot of friends." 
</P>
<P>
That day, Stangel said, she was planning to attend a party at the woman's home 
when she heard a news report of the killings. The party was in celebration of 
the third birthday of the woman's son, who police said was also found dead. A 
police spokesman confirmed that the child was believed to have turned 3 on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the woman also had a 3-month-old infant, who was uninjured -- 
possibly in the same house where his mother was found. But there was no 
official confirmation of that report, just as there was no official word on who 
else may have lived in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the afternoon and evening, homicide detectives and coroner's 
officials entered and exited the woman's single-story home, which was cordoned 
off by police.

WAR AGAINST MOSQUITOES COMES WITH STING OF FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hot, humid dog days of summer have returned to San Diego County, bringing 
with them malaria-bearing mosquitoes and a flurry of pesticide-spraying 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference from malaria scares of years past is that this time, 
beginning this week, the mosquito-spraying is being provided at the direct 
expense of the county's homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Under the county's new vector control program, approved by the Board of 
Supervisors Tuesday, individual property owners will be assessed for vector 
control services ranging from surveillance of the rat population to 
extermination of disease-carrying insects. The bill, which will be included in 
the property owner's annual tax assessment, will range from 38 cents for 
time-share condominiums to $19 for shopping centers or apartments with five or 
more units, according to Gary Stephany, county director of environmental 
health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanded Service 
</P>
<P>
The new system will save the county about $1.4 million a year -- the amount 
spent on vector control from the county's general fund last fiscal year. By 
contrast, the assessment system will pull in $3.2 million, directly from the 
homeowners' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
The extra millions will provide greatly expanded service, which, according to 
Stephany, will make the difference between scrambling to react to crises and 
keeping pests under control from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 30 years, we only increased the program by two staff members," 
Stephany said. "It got to the point where we were only doing crisis response . 
. . when it got real bad, we had to go out and spray in the air, then warn 
people to stay inside." 
</P>
<P>
The expanded program will provide for 22 more vector control technicians, more 
effective prevention services and, for the first time, rodent control. The 
county vector control program has focused on insect infestations throughout its 
40-year existence, but the need for rodent control became apparent after recent 
surveys showed evidence of rats in up to 31% of homes in the county, Stephany 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The mosquito problem, he said, has also increased exponentially with the 
unprecedented population boom, especially in North County. "Every time you 
create a new subdivision, you create more drainage, more surface runoff" from 
golf courses and lawns being watered, and cars being washed, Stephany said. New 
neighborhoods are also springing up closer than ever to the lagoons, canyons 
and drainage areas that are natural mosquito breeding grounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $43-million flood control project under way on the San Luis Rey River in 
Oceanside has also contributed to that community's mosquito problems, Stephany 
said. The Army Corps of Engineers project, which will create a flood-control 
channel, two holding ponds and levies on both sides of the river, will prevent 
nearby businesses and homes from having to pay exorbitant flood insurance 
rates, according to Oceanside spokesman Larry Bauman. But the construction 
work, which has created pools of stagnant water, may last another six months to 
two years, Bauman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Joined Reluctantly 
</P>
<P>
All 18 cities within the county have agreed to buy into the new vector control 
program, though some joined reluctantly. Stephany, who attended a variety of 
city council meetings to urge adoption of the new program, said he heard 
frequent complaints about the cost. "The comment I heard most often was, 'We 
don't want the county to come back to the cities for more money for any more 
programs,' " Stephany said. 
</P>
<P>
The El Cajon City Council, the last to join, granted its final approval Tuesday 
night after considering and rejecting the possibility of setting up its own 
vector control program. "It's just not cost-effective for a city (to do it 
itself)," Stephany said. "Plus, it's a regional problem. If you have an insect 
in one city, there's nothing to stop it from going over the city line." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside was another city that seriously considered establishing its own 
program and telling the county to keep its assessments to itself. But a city 
staff report concluded that it would cost $300,000 to $400,000 to hire four 
vector control specialists, purchase equipment and get the program under way. 
By contrast, the county's assessment to Oceanside will total $194,210 a year, 
according to a report submitted to the City Council by City Manager Ronald 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the city's urgent need for mosquito control, the council voted July 26 
to accept the county's terms. "We're not closing off our options," Bauman said. 
"It's still possible that in future years we might decide it will be more 
cost-effective and more effective in terms of mosquito control to design and 
manage our own program." 
</P>
<P>
National City Mayor George Waters also balked at approving the program, voting 
in the minority against joining it. According to Stephany, Waters felt the 
assessment was nothing more than another tax and noted that the city has 
promoted industry specifically to keep the residents' taxes down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat to Public Health 
</P>
<P>
The immediate need for mosquito control and the attendant threat to the public 
health was the factor that most influenced the cities that were holding back 
their approval. "Certainly, the comments made by people at the public hearing 
made it clear that mosquitoes are a big concern," said Oceanside's Bauman. 
</P>
<P>
The danger was vividly illustrated by reports of three documented cases of 
malaria within the last week. Two cases were reported Aug. 4 in Rancho 
Penasquitos, and another case was discovered Tuesday in Rancho Santa Fe, 
according to county health department spokesman Ron Yardley. 
</P>

In the last week, the county health department has "fogged" for mosquitoes in 
Rancho Santa Fe, Rancho Penasquitos, Oceanside and the Tijuana River Valley 
near the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two malaria cases were reported in 1988; 30 of the victims contracted 
the disease in the Del Dios area near Lake Hodges, southwest of Escondido. 
Yardley said 33 cases have been reported this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had three major outbreaks of malaria in the last four years, and each 
year it seems to be getting worse," Stephany said.

START OF TRIALS DELAYED FOR ABORTION PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The mass trials of some of more than 200 abortion protesters didn't begin as 
scheduled Wednesday because of two last-minute deals, including one that seemed 
likely to settle about half the cases, lawyers on both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
Talks in connection with a second batch of cases did not produce a settlement, 
however, so the first trials in those cases are scheduled to begin next week, 
the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
The first group of cases involves those activists charged with infractions. The 
second bloc involves more-serious misdemeanors. The protesters face charges in 
connection with arrests April 8, April 29 and June 10 at San Diego-area 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The infraction cases appeared to be resolved because the two sides agreed to a 
defense proposal first made Wednesday morning, said James M. Bishop, head 
deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a plea of no contest to the infraction -- primarily a trespass 
charge -- prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence to San Diego Municipal 
Judge John M. Thompson of one-day's community service, Bishop and defense 
attorney Timothy C. Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Performed Through Agencies 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said from the bench at a hearing Wednesday morning, confirming the 
bargain, that the service would be performed through agencies already on a 
court eligibility list. Although the protesters will not be able to suggest 
appropriate service, he said, that service will not conflict with their 
anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
To make the deal final, Rutherford said, he and lead defense lawyer Gregory J. 
Anthony need to get approval from each of the protesters involved in the about 
110 infraction charges. But he said it was "very likely to go down." 
</P>
<P>
The activists facing misdemeanor charges, meanwhile, agreed Wednesday to waive 
their right to a speedy trial. In return, prosecutors agreed to try them in 
groups of five. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, prosecutors had been prepared to try the protesters in four sets, 
one of 66, the others of 41, 19 and eight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Take a Year 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that, given the scheduling flexibility, the 20 or so trials will 
begin next Wednesday and run one after another. The whole process might take 
more than a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson set a pretrial hearing for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still going to clog the system, but it won't have the massive effect 
trying them in groups of 60 might have," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
After agreeing to trials in groups of five, prosecutors and defense lawyers 
could not agree in talks that took all of Wednesday afternoon about how to 
settle the misdemeanor cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the same problem all along," Bishop said. "The defense does not want 
any probation whatsoever, and we naturally want probation to ensure that we and 
the police and the citizens are not put through this again." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors insist that a condition of the probation include a directive that 
the protesters not engage in similar activity, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor charges include trespass, failure to disperse, resisting arrest 
and eight charges of conspiracy, Bishop said. Some of the protesters face 
multiple charges. 
</P>
<P>
More than 220 people were arrested in the three protests, but some chose to 
forfeit bail and had their cases dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors revealed Wednesday that a deputy assigned to the cases had received 
telephone threats. In addition, Bishop said, other deputies had received "lots 
of hate mail."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former top-ranking port official was sentenced Wednesday to 180 days in a 
work-furlough project for his participation in a scheme that defrauded the 
district of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
William Garrett, 49, who was in charge of marine operations at the San Diego 
Unified Port District, was also placed on five years' probation. San Diego 
Superior Court Judge Andrew Wagner ordered Garrett to pay $6,007.50 to the Port 
District in restitution and fined him $200. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett will surrender on an unspecified date to a facility that will allow him 
to remain free in the daytime but will lock him up at night and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett pleaded no contest June 12 to conspiring to defraud the Port District 
and to three counts of grand theft. He could have received a four-year state 
prison term and a $30,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The judge lectured Garrett before sentencing him by saying: "You should have 
known better. . . . What you stand here convicted of is a violation of trust. 
You're on the thin edge of prison." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lantz Lewis urged a six-month jail sentence -- a term also 
suggested by the county Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme involved filling out phony invoices for car repairs, equipment, 
appliances and computer equipment and billing the Port District through other 
firms on the pretense the items were for district property. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett is the second person sentenced in the case; five others have also been 
charged but they have pleaded innocent, except for one defendant who is a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he is satisfied with Garrett's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The others charged include: Rudi Enriques, 37; Richard Cersosimo, 49; Paul 
Manes, 49; Arnoldo Olivaria-Castillo, 55, and Ronald Barry Lewis, 45. Enriques, 
Cersosimo, and Manes face a Nov. 13 trial, and Lewis is scheduled for a 
preliminary hearing Sept. 11. Olivaria-Castillo is believed to have fled to 
Mexico since he was charged in January.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCILMAN DENIES PLAN FOR ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood Councilman Jose Fernandez said at a Lennox community meeting that 
Inglewood has no plans to annex the unincorporated area, although he said such 
a move would help relieve Lennox's drug, crime and blight problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although Inglewood is studying the costs and benefits of annexing the portion 
of Lennox north of Lennox Boulevard, Fernandez said such a move is not in the 
works and would not be made unless Lennox residents were behind it. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, several residents said they are still apprehensive that 
Inglewood, Hawthorne or the county have secret plans to redevelop their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox is inside Inglewood's and Hawthorne's "sphere of influence," a planning 
term that gives those municipalities the right to consider annexation. The 
county is preparing a revised community plan for the area, which officials say 
they will present to residents in September. 
</P>
<P>
"We're poor people that are not against progress, but we want to preserve our 
rights," said Hector Carrio, vice president of the Lennox Coordinating Council.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS FUNDS TO BUY HOTEL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite continued opposition by some residents, the Monterey Park City Council 
has approved paying $4 million for a seven-acre site at the Los Angeles 
Corporate Center, where a 225-room Embassy Suites Hotel would be developed. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel project, approved by a 4-1 vote this week, could result in the city's 
gaining $750,000 in revenues and taxes annually, city officials say. Beyond 
that, City Manager Mark Lewis said the hotel would be a considerable boost to 
the community's overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed six-story hotel, billed by city officials as a first-class 
business hotel, would overlook a residential neighborhood next to the corporate 
center on the city's western edge along the Long Beach Freeway. The project 
represents the largest and most complicated deal undertaken by the city's 
Redevelopment Agency, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the city will pay $4 million to the Los Angeles Corporate 
Center for the land where the hotel would be built. The city would then sell 
the land to the developer for $2.5 million, making the money back later from 
taxes.

CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WON $1-BILLION PAYOFF FROM LOTTERY DURING YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California State Lottery hit the jackpot in the last fiscal year as 
revenues reached $2.6 billion, lottery Executive Director Chon Gutierrez 
announced Wednesday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Record-breaking fiscal 1988-89 lottery sales for the first time provided more 
than $1 billion to the state's public education system, Gutierrez said. "We had 
a terrific year, the best one yet." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Unified School District is the second-largest recipient of 
lottery money, trailing only Los Angeles schools, according to Lottery figures. 
San Diego city schools will receive more than $20 million from 1988-89 lottery 
proceeds, part of the $78 million due schools in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have already included the anticipated lottery revenues in the 
district's current $540 million budget, said Acting Supt. Cathy Hopper. The 
money is not designated for specific projects, and is used simply to balance 
the books, Hopper said. 
</P>
<P>
By law, at least 34% of lottery revenues is earmarked for public education, but 
that number rose to 40% last year, according to Gutierrez. The lottery awarded 
half of its income to prize winners and spent 10% on expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery's contributions to public schools rose by a third from the 1987-88 
fiscal year, Gutierrez said. Lottery funds make up 3% of school budgets 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery distributes money to the school systems based on their size. For 
the fiscal year that ended June 30, districts earned $181 from the lottery for 
every student enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery surveys show that 60% of Californians played the weekly Lotto or an 
instant game within the last month, according to Gutierrez. Although state 
residents are still buying only a third as many tickets per-capita as players 
in Ohio and Massachusetts, sales for July point to the current fiscal year 
being another record breaker, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hopper said lottery experts have warned her district not to expect 
another record-breaking year. "A lot of people have been telling us that the 
lottery has peaked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez disagreed. He said fully automated, self-service Lotto machines due 
in San Diego within months, and a daily drawing game set to begin next year 
will push sales higher.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 291 to 123, the House approved a fiscal 1990 budget of $1.6 
billion for itself and congressional support agencies. That is an increase of 
14% over the comparable fiscal 1989 bill. After the Senate adds its budget of 
more than $400 million, the cost of operating the legislative branch in 1990 
will top $2 billion. Members' salaries of nearly $50 million are funded 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
Among items in the House-passed bill are $188 million for the salaries of House 
members' personal staffs (up 5% from comparable 1989 figure), $118 million for 
committee operations including staff salaries (up 7%) and $123 million for 
House members' and senators' free-mail privileges. The postage sum is 
open-ended and likely to be increased, despite new language reducing from six 
to four the number of mass mailings House members can send to constituents each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Cutting Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 167 to 246, the House rejected an amendment cutting nearly all 
areas of the 1990 legislative branch budget (above) by 6.25%, for a savings of 
$97 million. "What used to be called the '$1-billion Congress' has become the 
'$2-billion Congress,' " said amendment spon sor Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) 
Opponent Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) said the amendment "would cut some items that 
are very fundamental in terms of the members' ability to work around this 
place." 
</P>

Debt Limit

<P>
The House voted 231 to 185 to raise the national debt ceiling by $70 billion to 
about $2.87 trillion. The new limit, which was sent to the Senate, will enable 
the government to pay its bills while awaiting congressional approval of a 
separate measure putting the federal borrowing limit at $3.123 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the higher debt ceiling.

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 206 to 219, the House refused to further restrict abortion in the 
District of Columbia. The defeated amendment sought to renew a ban on the 
district using its own revenue as well as its federal pay ment to provide 
abortions for the poor. It also sought to toughen the ban so that the 
district's own money could no longer be spent on abortions deemed necessary 
because the mother's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred during debate on the D.C. appropriations bill for fiscal 
1990, later sent to the Senate. It liberalizes federal abortion law as it is 
applied to D.C. But the federal city remains severely restricted in using money 
it gets from the U.S. Treasury for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to further restrict public funding of abortions in 
D.C.

Savings and Loan Rescue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 170 to 250, the House rejected a GOP attempt to put the cost of 
the savings and loan rescue off the federal budget. The vote kept the thrift 
bailout bill from being sent back to a House-Senate conference committee where 
the off-budget language was to have been added. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the bill was returned to conference, following the Senate's 
refusal to waive the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law to permit counting the 
multibillion-dollar bailout as part of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was how to treat about $50 billion in immediate borrowing needed to 
close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts and meet insurance obligations to 
depositors. The reworked bill taken up by the House and Senate late Friday put 
$20 billion of the borrowing on this year's budget, as most Democrats wanted, 
and left the remaining $30 billion to be raised by industry bonds as advocated 
by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported an off-budget financing arrangement for the 
savings and loan bailout.

YOSEMITE CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to thank The Times and staff writer Clay Evans for the excellent 
coverage of Mark Wellman's courageous climb to be the first paraplegic to scale 
Yosemite's 3,200-foot El Capitan. 
</P>
<P>
Having known Mark for several years, there is much more to add to this personal 
triumph of the human spirit than the world knows. And the world should know. 
</P>
<P>
Once told by doctors he would never lead any kind of "normal" or "active" life 
after his tragic climbing accident in 1982, Mark has continuously proven his 
critics wrong. For he is not the least bit handicapped, but on the contrary, he 
is much more active than most normal people. Besides being a year-round park 
ranger, he's a nationally ranked wheelchair tennis player, and intermediate 
kayaker, an avid swimmer (using buoyants to keep his legs afloat), rides a 
specialized "bike" that he operates with his arms, while also heading 
Yosemite's handicapped skiing program at Badger Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he's a great athlete, a great inspiration. But most of all, he's a great 
friend. SuperGimp, we're proud of you! Now the whole world knows.

GROWTH HORMONE IN MILK SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had read some time ago that new genetic growth hormones were being introduced 
to promote milk production and I wondered what the need was for increased 
production when, for years, we have subsidized the dairy industry. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein's article gives us the answer -- $500 million in annual worldwide sales 
by five chemical manufacturers -- and the FDA is ready to approve it! What 
about the health and growth of infants and children, the threat of cancer and 
other consumer health risks? 
</P>
<P>
It really burns me up that medications, tested, tried, approved and 
successfully used in Europe, are being held back in the United States by the 
FDA that is about to allow a potentially dangerous drug into our food chain.

THE MERITS OF EMOTIONAL DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Carter may have lost his chance for reelection in 1980 because he made 
the fate of the American hostages in Tehran the preoccupying burden of his 
presidency. Ronald Reagan blundered or was led into covertly selling arms to 
Iran because he hoped to win freedom for the American hostages in Lebanon. Both 
Presidents, by their displays of public compassion for the hostages and their 
families, demonstrated what in other circumstances would be regarded as 
admirable humane instincts. 
</P>
<P>
But the political lesson of those experiences is that a President, however 
great his sympathetic identification with the victims of terrorism, best serves 
the country by keeping a certain emotional distance from their plight. George 
Bush seems to have absorbed that lesson. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush made clear again this week, he has not put the hostages out of his mind 
or slackened his efforts through diplomatic channels to gain their freedom. But 
he has also been careful not to put what might be perceived as an exceptionally 
high value on their well-being and their return. He has made it a point to 
avoid emotional involvement by not communicating personally with the families 
of the hostages, delegating that to others. And he has not wasted his time by 
directing public pleas to the terrorists who hold the hostages or to their 
sponsors in Iran; as everyone in government knows by now, such people aren't 
moved by appeals to decency. Their surest response in fact would be to regard a 
plea not as evidence of concern but as sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, Bush has similarly avoided issuing bold-sounding, if not necessarily 
practical, threats against hostage-taking, as Ronald Reagan did on his 
Inauguration Day in 1981. Bush did make clear, through diplomatic and press 
channels, that any further harm to the hostages would invite a military 
response. But by not putting that warning in the form of an explicit public 
challenge, he gave those to whom it was directed a chance to exercise restraint 
without appearing to bow to pressure. Meanwhile, first through diplomatic 
channels and then publicly, Bush has signaled that he is ready to have full 
discussions with Iran, presumably meaning talks not just about the hostages but 
about a range of bilateral issues. 
</P>
<P>
On the most basic, human level, it obviously hasn't been easy to refrain from 
threatening words and even forceful action after the murder of Lt. Col. William 
R. Higgins was so brutally disclosed and so obscenely flaunted. But it has been 
what conditions require, as offstage diplomacy explores the chances for a 
multiparty exchange of prisoners and hostages. Bush has so far acquitted 
himself in this matter firmly, responsibly, dispassionately, and for that he 
deserves credit.

FORMATION OF SPLINTER PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ross K. Baker's column "Women's Splinter Party Would Stymie Friends and Comfort 
Enemies" (Op-Ed Page, July 27) expresses that he doesn't have a clue which way 
the political drift is shifting! 
</P>
<P>
The recent success of the Japanese women in their government is not mentioned 
in Baker's article, while he claims the National Organization for Women (NOW) 
would establish an "American Women's Party on a fool's errand which could not 
even count on the support of Alan Alda," based on his stated belief women have 
such limited issues. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Baker, women have more savvy in all matters of life on earth watching, 
hearing, feeling and enduring men in all walks of life running the world in 
gross ignorance, and are more than ready to give their support to a national 
women's party which would also receive a "man-date." 
</P>
<P>
Your column was the most snide, arrogant, foolish and belittling bias I've read 
in a long time against women. Prof. Baker, wise up!

U.S. ALLIES WON'T LIKE DETENTE WITH IRAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIREEN T. HUNTER, Shireen T. Hunter is deputy director of the Middle East 
program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest hostage crisis has been taking place at a delicate moment in the 
political evolution of the Middle East. If not properly handled, the crisis may 
reverse positive trends of the last few months, thereby prolonging the 
hostages' anguish and worsening the political atmosphere in the region -- 
particularly regarding Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly in recent months, Iranian politics have become introspective. 
Under its new leadership, focused on newly elected President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, Iran has clearly indicated that its first priority is to rebuild 
its economy and to improve the conditions of its long-suffering people. Iran 
also needs to rebuild its military forces, which are now inferior to almost all 
of its neighbors'. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, Iran must abandon its adventurous policies and 
normalize relations with the outside world. Thus, Iran's new spiritual leader, 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said that it can be an object of emulation for 
other Muslims only if it builds an economically advanced and just society at 
home. In effect, this means abandoning the aggressive export of revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of this new thinking has been evident in Iran's attitude toward 
factions in Lebanon. During the last few months, it had begun to distance 
itself from Hezbollah (the Party of God) to improve its relations with Amal, a 
more moderate Shiite movement, and to reach out to other Muslim groups. Only 
two days before Israel abducted Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, reports emanated from 
Beirut to the effect that changes in Iran and in its relations with the 
Lebanese Shiites might lead to the release of Western hostages, who were 
becoming a political liability. Since their confinement has long been viewed in 
the United States to be the principal impediment to better -- or at least 
non-hostile -- U.S.-Iranian relations, these developments were raising hopes of 
progress in resolving this long-standing impasse. 
</P>
<P>
The capture of Obeid, a village clergyman in southern Lebanon, gave the Iranian 
radicals a new lease on life. In an emotional outburst, Interior Minister Ali 
Akbar Mohtashemi said that any conciliatory gesture toward the United States, 
including on the hostage question, would be a betrayal of the late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini's teachings. Mohtashemi even challenged the legality of 
Rafsanjani's presidency, arguing that the outgoing president (Khamenei) 
technically remains in office until Oct. 3, and that Rafsanjani must get the 
approval of Parliament before assuming power. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, recent calls in the United States for military retaliation 
against Iran could undo much of the recent gains for Iranian pragmatists, just 
as last spring's controversy over the novel "Satanic Verses" aborted Iran's 
nascent moderate trend. 
</P>
<P>
In handling the hostage crisis, it is important for U.S. leaders to judge the 
impact of the options on the evolution of Iran's political scene. Here U.S. 
interests may diverge from those of some of its regional allies. Many countries 
in the Middle East have taken advantage of Iran's misguided extremism and its 
estrangement from the United States to advance their own goals. They would not 
look favorably at the prospect of a more moderate Iran and better U.S.-Iranian 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Israel and some Arab states have used Arab-Iranian tensions to 
divert attention from the Palestinian problem. Egypt has used these tensions to 
gain influence in the Persian Gulf and to be readmitted to the Arab fold. And, 
along with Jordan, it used Iraq's problems with Iran to try persuading Baghdad 
to be more forthcoming on the Arab-Israeli peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Some countries would therefore view a more moderate Iran as a mixed blessing. 
Israel, which has suffered from Iranian extremism, would be unlikely to welcome 
an Iran that no longer kept Arab states preoccupied. Saudi Arabia, which has 
used U.S.-Iranian estrangement to consolidate its foothold in Southwest Asia, 
would not welcome efforts by a moderate Iran to be included in a settlement in 
Afghanistan. Iraq, of course, fears that Iran's move toward moderation would 
make it more acceptable to the West. Last week Baghdad called Rafsanjani's 
conciliatory remarks about the hostages a "trick." 
</P>
<P>
Thus its regional allies' pursuit of their own goals has complicated America's 
agenda, especially efforts to ease tensions with Iran. U.S. policy has already 
begun paying the price of the recent Soviet-Iranian rapprochement and Iran's 
possible accommodation with the regime in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. domestic politics and competing concerns in the Middle East make it 
difficult for Washington to take the initiative in moving toward better 
relations with Iran, and they could also constrain a U.S. response to any 
Iranian lead. In judging its course of action, the United States should focus 
on its own short- and long-term interests and not to be swayed by the parochial 
interests of its allies.

SAN PEDRO HIGH GRADS GATHER TO HONOR THE EXTRAORDINARY FRIEND THEY LAST SAW 50 
YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The last time some of Mary Nakahara Kochiyama's friends saw her, nylon 
stockings were new on the market, "Over the Rainbow" was a popular hit and 
Germany was about to invade Poland. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1939, and Kochiyama and 300 classmates were graduating from San Pedro 
High School. Soon, many classmates would risk and lose their lives in World War 
II. Kochiyama and thousands of other Japanese-Americans would be uprooted from 
their homes and confined to relocation camps. 
</P>
<P>
The sorrows and resentments of the war years could easily have destroyed young 
friendships among Kochiyama and her classmates, but the ties have stood the 
test of time. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years after the class of '39 finished high school, more than 200 San 
Pedro High "Pirates" from the 1930s and 1940s showed up last weekend for a 
nostalgic homecoming in Kochiyama's honor. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this woman so well-remembered after so many years? 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought about that many times," said Sam Domancich, who helped plan the 
homecoming celebration. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons so many people turned out -- the luncheon had to be moved to 
a larger restaurant to accommodate the crowd -- is that San Pedro is such a 
close-knit community, Domancich said. San Pedro was victory and the thrill of 
defeat." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, during tribute speeches, Kochiyama was not at the head table but 
crouched in the audience, taking pictures of the speakers. Ben Tagami, 
president of the Japanese-American veterans of the celebrated 100th Infantry 
Battalion and the 442nd ("Go for Broke") Regiment, offered her a scrapbook from 
the war era, but Kochiyama suggested it be given instead to her husband, a 
442nd veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Kochiyama has become a legend in San Pedro because of her friendliness and 
school spirit, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
A sports enthusiast, she covered games for the school newspaper and phoned in 
results to the San Pedro News-Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pedaled to Games 
</P>
<P>
Retired teacher and tennis coach Nick Zorotovich, himself a 1923 graduate of 
San Pedro High, told his favorite story about how Kochiyama used to travel to 
all the games on a bicycle trimmed in the school colors, black and gold. Once, 
when the school bus was en route to a tennis tournament in far-off Santa 
Monica, players spotted the young cub reporter pedaling her way through 
Inglewood and stopped to pick her up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"San Pedro was a very sports-minded town, and this united all the 
nationalities," Kochiyama said. "Everyone accepted the differences and saw the 
diversity as a plus." 
</P>
<P>
Kochiyama also is beloved for her efforts to boost morale among the 
Japanese-Americans who were confined to relocation camps during World War II 
and for Nisei soldiers who fought for America. 
</P>
<P>
"The government calls them relocation camps, but we called them concentration 
camps," Kochiyama said in an interview. Still, she said, "I grew up in a mostly 
white world, and I never got to know my own people till we were sent to camp." 
</P>
<P>
Kochiyama and her family first were sent to the Santa Anita Assembly Center and 
then to Jerome, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
In the camps, Kochiyama helped establish a youth organization called the 
Crusaders that conducted a letter-writing campaign for soldiers of Japanese 
ancestry who were fighting in the U.S. forces. "We started out with just five 
names, but by the time the camps closed, 2 1/2 or 3 years later, we were 
writing to 13,000," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kochiyama said she and others spent their $8-a-month camp pay on postage and 
received contributions from soldiers themselves, who collected money in their 
helmets on the battlefield. San Pedro soldiers were steadfast in supporting the 
letter-writing effort, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In poignant letters she wrote to her mother during the final months of the war, 
Kochiyama talked of her struggle to run USO Centers in Hattiesburg, Miss., and 
later in Minneapolis/St. Paul, after she was released from the camp in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
In the yellowed letters, which the family has collected in a well-worn black 
notebook, Kochiyama asks for her mother's recipes and speaks of spending her 
own money to keep the letters and post cards going out to servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
In one letter, dated April 18, 1945, she told her mother she planned to live at 
the USO in Hattiesburg. "Then, the rent money can be used for stamps," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The letters to her mother also presage her later involvement in the civil 
rights movement in the 1960s, when she moved to Harlem and became more militant 
in her views. 
</P>
<P>
Kochiyama said she became a follower of Malcolm X and was with him when he was 
assassinated in 1965. One of her most prized mementos is a Life magazine cover 
photo showing her kneeling over the slain black leader's body, she said. The 
struggles of blacks to achieve equal rights "influenced all minority rights 
struggles," and helped spawn the Asian-American movement in the late 1960s, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civil Rights Activities 
</P>
<P>
Today, Kochiyama is a member of the New African People's Organization, an 
outgrowth of the black power movement. She also has been active in New 
York-based Concerned Japanese-Americans and the National Coalition for 
Redress/Reparations, groups that are seeking compensation for 
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Her life's work is hinted at in a letter she wrote to her mother on Aug. 15, 
1945, three days after Japan surrendered. First, she muses about the 
differences in the characters of the Japanese and American people that led to 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Japan has been defeated.... Strange, isn't it, that one country's 
greatness could be another country's doom. America's greatest gift to her 
people was freedom. And her people love it. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's greatest gift to her people was an orthodox way of life. And her 
people love it. ... 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much we human beings can't understand. I guess because we only 
live once. If we lived, died and were reincarnated, and lived again after every 
death -- living each time under a different color of skin and experiencing the 
hardship of every race, maybe we wouldn't be so harsh and critical and selfish 
and limited. We would be humble and loving and kind and 'broad' because we 
would understand what it feels like to be black, yellow, brown and white. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful thinking, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
As Kochiyama accepted the tributes and applause of her high school friends last 
weekend, it appeared that some of the hopes she expressed in the letter to her 
mother may have been realized. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the war, hysteria, and the uprootment of Japanese-Americans, 
friendships have continued," she said. "Fifty years have passed by without some 
of us seeing one another, yet on the strength of happy memories, warm 
relationships have remained intact."

Photo, Bye-Bye Sheep -- After a San Pedro Municipal Court rejected his bid to 
keep eight sheep on acreage near an apartment complex he owns at Pacific Avenue 
and 24th Street, developer Arthur Corona held a roundup Wednesday to ship the 
flock to a farm in Chino. Perhaps best suited for the task at hand was the 
family dog. Corona, below left, also got some help from Samuel Rodriguez, in 
hat, and Michael Mendoza. Corona's son, Brian, bottom left, holds one 
recalcitrant sheep for loading. Arthur Corona was philosophical in defeat, 
although he faces a $1,000 fine and a maximum six-month jail sentence after 
being found guilty on a misdemeanor charge. "If it's God's will for my life 
that I don't have the sheep in San Pedro, so be it," he said. TODD ROSENBERG

MOBIL PLANS BIG FESTIVITY AT BELEAGUERED REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the unease of Torrance officials, Mobil Oil plans to invite thousands of the 
refinery's neighbors to party at its beleaguered plant on Oct. 7. There will be 
jugglers, clowns, hot dogs, hamburgers, a Ferris wheel, a carousel and booths 
about the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
It will all be free and refinery officials, who have yet to send out the 
invitations for the $200,000 bash, expect as many as 12,000 people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials say it has nothing to do with a measure on the ballot in March, 
which would force the refinery to stop using hydrofluoric acid, a highly toxic 
chemical, or a lawsuit by the city that seeks to declare the refinery a public 
nuisance subject to city regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Mobil officials say, the festivities are the latest in a concerted 
image-building effort that has included a tabloid publication about the 
refinery, bus tours of the plant and advertisements in local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials learned of the party proposal in a July 25 letter from Mobil 
seeking city assistance for crowd and traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Ken Nelson, whose staff is researching what permits Mobil would need 
for the party, said the idea of having thousands of people attend a party on 
refinery grounds "makes me very uncomfortable" because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at it very closely," he said. The refinery, he added, is "not 
exactly your local winery." 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawsuit cites a host of troubles at the plant, including state and 
federal investigations into safety and health problems, as well as a series of 
explosions, fires, fatal accidents and gas releases. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert described Mobil's party plans as "very strange. They expect 
10,000 to 12,000 at a facility under which the very best of conditions is a 
dangerous facility and where extreme precautions need to be taken. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I know they are putting out a great effort on their public relations," she 
said, "but I'm not sure this is what I would have thought up. It sounds like 
something you would have for the opening of a mall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mobil Says It's Safe 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti rejected suggestions that the party is 
ill-advised for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 830 employees working here," he said. "If we thought it was dangerous, 
we wouldn't be working here. We don't think we are endangering anybody's life." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said Mobil does not envision the party as a demonstration -- 
to be used later in the city's lawsuit -- that thousands of people of all ages 
consider the refinery a safe place and not a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that has even been considered," Carbonetti said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the reason for the party is that Mobil is merely following the 
advice of City Council members "that we should communicate better to the 
community, and this is one of the ways we are doing it. . . . The timing was 
picked to get the most people. . . . It happens to be our 60th anniversary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowd Control 
</P>
<P>
Despite the spate of bad publicity about the refinery, Mobil expects so many 
people that it is worried about handling traffic and crowds. That prompted the 
letter from Mobil Security Director Daniel J. Malinowski to the city on July 
25. 
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that attendance will be approximately 10,000 to 12,000 persons 
for that day," wrote Malinowski, noting that the Police Department had already 
agreed to help with traffic. "In order to allow everyone to have a good time 
and provide for their safety, we request permission to borrow approximately 100 
barricades and/or traffic cones for crowd control and traffic flow purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Horkay, Torrance transportation director, said the city has begun 
discussions with Mobil about the use of the cones.

HUNDREDS FORCED TO WAIT IN PARKING LOT OF PACKED WELFARE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the third straight day, hundreds of people were forced to wait for hours 
Wednesday in the parking lot of the county's Southwest District welfare office 
after Fire Department officials cited the office for allowing too many people 
into its waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people stood in lines as security guards and workers with 
bullhorns attempted to keep order. Nevertheless, groups of anxious people 
pressing up against the Athens office's front door created what one social 
services worker called "chaos just about as bad as it gets." 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Stevenson, a 29-year-old homeless woman who had been in line every day 
this week, said she spent Tuesday night under a bush a few blocks from the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people here (Wednesday) before daylight," she said. "It looks like 
I'll be back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Returning for a second day at the facility on Imperial Highway near Normandie 
Avenue was Rebecca, 29, who asked that her last name not be used. A mother of 
two from Inglewood, she went to the office to find out why her $663-a-month 
assistance had been cut off. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't bend my legs at the end of the day yesterday. . . . It's really 
demeaning to go through this, to have to wait in the parking lot, but I have to 
do it for my family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other angry and tired people said they had been at the facility every day since 
Monday when the county Fire Department conducted its inspection of the county 
Department of Public Social Services office and ordered that no more than 133 
people be allowed inside at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"They are treating people like cattle," grumbled Chris Cole of Hawthorne, who 
made it into the facility Wednesday afternoon after about six hours of waiting. 
"There is no organization. These people live stressful lives already, and this 
makes it a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest District office, which Fire Department officials have warned 
about overcrowding in the past, is one of the county's largest and busiest 
welfare facilities, with a caseload of 28,000 from the South Bay and Westside, 
said Colleen Moskal, a spokeswoman for the social services department. It 
combines in one waiting room those seeking county General Relief funds, food 
stamps and medical assistance with those seeking Aid for Families With 
Dependent Children. 
</P>
<P>
Like all of the county's welfare offices, it is busiest early in the month, she 
said, partly because welfare checks are issued then. 
</P>
<P>
Rising numbers of clients have created a strain on the waiting rooms of several 
of the county's 31 welfare offices during the beginning-of-the-month rush, 
Moskal said. The county's overall caseload grew by 15% last year, she said, and 
the number of clients grew 0.5% between April and May of this year, from 
910,747 to 915,450. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skid Row Office Cited 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department cited the department's Civic Center office on Skid Row 
earlier this year, and county officials say the Rancho Park office in West Los 
Angeles suffered severe overcrowding until waiting rooms were expanded last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando has threatened to close the Maclay Avenue facility there, although 
its authority to do so is unclear. In response to neighborhood complaints that 
the homeless are loitering at that facility, Supervisor Mike Antonovich has 
asked the county social services department to step up its search for a new 
facility in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
An advocate for the poor said the conditions at the Southwest District office 
illustrate the county's attitude toward the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's symptomatic of a much larger question," said Gary Blasi, director of the 
Homeless Project at the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. "The county Board 
of Supervisors has essentially adopted a policy where they don't care about 
people applying for public assistance. If you compare these waits with waits 
for real estate developers at the Hall of Records, you see the priorities of 
the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Foundation and Los Angeles have teamed up in a lawsuit against 
the county challenging the county's administration of the General Relief 
program on behalf of the homeless mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Top Priority 
</P>
<P>
John Zaccone, director of administrative services for the department, said his 
office considers the crowding problem a top priority and is moving aggressively 
to expand facilities to remedy it. 
</P>
<P>
But Lisa Foster, a staff attorney with Legal Aid, said bigger waiting rooms 
will not solve the problem. She called it "unconscionable" that the poor and 
homeless should have to spend all day waiting outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
"It often takes all day for the county to deal with someone. People have 
appointments at 9 or 10 in the morning and they don't see their worker until 2 
or 3 in the afternoon. They have to figure out a way to process these people 
faster. There is no reason it should take all day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renovation Planned 
</P>
<P>
Zaccone said the county plans to renovate the Southwest facility to create 
another waiting room elsewhere in the building. The project should be completed 
by early next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county also is consolidating four cramped welfare offices in the Long Beach 
and Harbor areas with a more spacious facility near Compton, Zaccone said. The 
new, 133,000-square-foot regional headquarters will have about 20% more space 
than the old offices combined. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, county officials are seeking a new building to 
replace the cramped Maclay Avenue facility, which has a waiting room that holds 
35 people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are attempting to alleviate the problem," Moskal said. "The problem is 
attributable to a greater caseload. We have something that is not necessarily 
in our control."

CHICANOS STILL NEGOTIATING BALLOT SUIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations in the Chicano Federation's election lawsuit against the city of 
San Diego continued Wednesday without discussion of the settlement offered 
Tuesday by the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no formal offer," said Patricia Meyer, attorney for the Latino 
advocacy group, which is attempting to gain greater political power for 
minorities through the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Just Talking' 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there is no proposal on the table," she added. "We're just talking 
about different avenues and different problems and how things might occur. 
Really and truly, we're just in negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer and attorneys for the city met in a settlement conference with U. S. 
Magistrate Harry McCue on Wednesday morning. Deputy City Atty. Ken So said only 
that negotiations are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the possibility that a federal judge might postpone the Sept. 19 
council election as a result of the lawsuit, the council offered to settle the 
suit by giving voters a chance to expand the council from eight to 10 seats in 
a June referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, however, virtually rejected that offer the same day, saying it does not 
address the group's other demands, including the creation of an independent 
commission to redraw council district boundaries. That complex and politically 
sensitive process is now handled by the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuit Updated 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades agreed to allow the Chicano 
Federation to amend its lawsuit aimed at altering the city's electoral system. 
Rhoades also scheduled an Aug. 28 hearing on whether he has the authority to 
order the city to place election changes sought by the Chicano Federation on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If Rhoades agrees to do that, the Chicano Federation probably will ask the 
judge to postpone the Sept. 19 council election until June on the grounds that 
the current election system is unconstitutional.

CLAIREMONT BANK ROBBED; SUSPECT TIED TO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police and the FBI are investigating the robbery Wednesday of a Union Bank 
branch in Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
The same suspect -- described as a tanned white male in his early 20s -- may 
have been involved in seven or eight other bank heists in the Clairemont area, 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit entered the bank about 2 p.m., told the teller he had a weapon and 
handed the teller a note demanding money, Robinson said. He received $1,525, 
placed it in a gym bag and escaped, the police spokesman said.

ABORTION ISSUE AT THE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While my wife and I had a very pleasant time at the recent San Fernando Valley 
Fair, it was somewhat marred by the presence of an anti-abortion exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that I disagree with their point of view is not the issue. The fair is 
supposed to be an agricultural exhibition, not a political or religious event. 
Considering the turmoil surrounding the abortion issue, someone at the fair's 
booking office obviously decided to make a statement. 
</P>
<P>
I'm making a statement too. We will not attend the fair in the future if this 
continues. Or maybe we'll bring a vocal contingent of pro-choice people with us 
and raise the barn roof.

GROUPS SUPPORT RESEDA EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article (July 21) on the extension and paving of Reseda Boulevard to 
Mulholland Drive failed to include the testimony before the Fire Commission of 
the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety Organization and the Encino Property Owners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
These groups jointly and vigorously support the extension of Reseda Boulevard 
into the Santa Monica Mountains. We want road access to Mulholland Drive and 
the paving of Mulholland Drive so that the residents of Tarzana and the West 
Valley will have their own access to the San Diego Freeway and stop using our 
already overly burdened hillside streets as a bypass to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow, winding, hazardous streets in the fire-prone hillside area of 
Encino have become a threat to our public safety and need relief now. 
</P>
<P>
In no way can our streets absorb increased traffic from the 350 homes planned 
along both sides of Reseda Boulevard around the country clubs of Braemar and El 
Caballero. We protest our street conditions where cars damage our gardens, 
smash our fences, total our cars and crash through the walls of our homes. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the extension and paving of Reseda Boulevard talk about preserving 
hiking trails, while we cannot walk along our streets without getting hit by 
cars. We cannot allow our children to play on the sidewalks in front of their 
own houses. How can we allow them to walk to school?

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: D.A. TAKES OVER REFINERY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has taken over the 
prosecution of two top-ranking officials at Mobil's Torrance refinery on 
charges that they contributed to the death of a contract worker and to the 
injuries of two others in an explosion July 15, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The case, brought originally by Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord, also names 
three top officials of Cal Cat Chemical Inc. of Benicia. 
</P>
<P>
Lord said he had asked the district attorney's office in late July to prosecute 
the case because of new information that could elevate the charges from 
misdemeanors to felony manslaughter. Lord said the additional information 
surfaced after he filed the case July 15. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Fred Maksoud said his office is taking the case as "an 
accommodation" to Lord, but said he could not answer other questions because of 
the continuing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said, "The charges are meritless, and we intend 
to defend our position rigorously." 
</P>
<P>
The case filed July 15, with 19 misdemeanor counts, names Wyman Robb, Mobil 
refinery manager; Tom Gregory, former assistant refinery manager, and the three 
Cal Cat Chemical officials. Mobil officials are to be arraigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred as Cal Cat Chemical employees were treating sludge from 
the bottom of storage tanks containing water contaminated with sulfur 
compounds.

ANTONOVICH CALLS FOR COMPROMISE ON WETLANDS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS, LANDOWNERS AT ODDS ON DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR DESERT OASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Wednesday that he hopes a 
wetlands area near Palmdale that has been the subject of a debate over proposed 
development can be protected because of its archeological and biological value. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich toured the Barrel Springs wetlands in the Antelope Valley with 
residents who oppose a plan to build 8 homes on the 63-acre county parcel on 
the edge of Palmdale between Avenue T-8 and the California Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very valid issue," Antonovich said. "Because of the archeological 
significance, this area could be a learning center for young people from 
kindergarten all the way up through community college." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich and his staff members said the supervisor is not taking sides in the 
dispute. Antonovich said that he hopes local activists, government agencies and 
the landowners, Stanley and Lois Sevilla, can fashion a compromise, and said 
that state parkland or education funds might be available for preservation of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biological Study 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the county Regional Planning Commission instructed Sevilla to 
commission a biological study of wildlife in the wetlands, delaying until 
October the appeal of a hearing officer's approval of the construction 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal environmental officials have urged stringent restrictions on 
development of the Barrel Springs area because it is a rare oasis in the 
desert. It has been a hub of human activity for thousands of years, yielding 
the earliest archeological evidence of human presence in the Antelope Valley 
and a wealth of Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's comments were praised by Jim McAvoy, president of the North Los 
Angeles County Coalition for Planned Growth and Responsive Government, who 
arranged the 5th District supervisor's tour. "I think he seemed genuinely 
interested," McAvoy said. "I believe he recognized the uniqueness of the area 
and the fact that it's worth saving." 
</P>
<P>
Also touring the area was Antelope Valley Community College President Allan 
Kurki, who said he is interested in preserving the area because of its 
potential educational value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Density 
</P>
<P>
While the landowner has said his low-density development would not harm the 
natural resources of the area, McAvoy said even minimal development would be 
ecologically devastating. He and others want the county to acquire the property 
and designate it an environmentally protected area. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute could come to the Board of Supervisors if either side appeals the 
eventual decision by the Regional Planning Commission. But before the 
commission reviews the case Oct. 11, Antonovich suggested compromises, such as 
clustering the proposed homes away from wetland areas, or obtaining county 
approval to transfer the proposed housing to a 118-acre site south of the 
California Aqueduct, the southern boundary of the Sevillas' property. 
</P>
<P>
But Lois Sevilla said Wednesday that moving the project is impossible because 
she and her husband have already sold the land they owned south of the 
aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been our feeling all along that the development could be done 
consistently with ecological values," she said. "That's why it's low density. 
We are surprised that we're getting this kind of response." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Palmdale City Council and Planning Commission will 
hold a joint meeting Tuesday to discuss possible methods of preserving the 
wetlands.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council has delayed action on an ordinance to tighten 
controls on the use and storage of acutely hazardous chemicals in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday was to consider whether to hire a law firm to study further 
regulating acutely hazardous materials used by more than a 100 companies 
throughout Torrance. Instead, City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson suggested that the 
council delay action until Aug. 29 to give staff more time to study current 
state, county and federal laws on hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said he wants his office and the Fire Department to further study the 
issue before the city spends money on an outside firm. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion for tighter restrictions came during a council meeting in May, 
when Councilman Tim Mock requested that city staff draft a proposed ballot 
measure to tighten controls on all hazardous chemicals in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mock said he wanted the measure to require industries to obtain a 
conditional-use permit to use and store acutely hazardous chemicals. A panel of 
experts would review the safety of a chemical's use on a case-by-case basis 
before issuing a permit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed measure might also provide voters with an alternative to a 
ballot initiative in March, which would restrict the use of acutely hazardous 
hydrofluoric acid at the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, council members have indicated that they are no longer interested 
in a ballot measure but would still favor tighter restrictions on hazardous 
materials, Nelson said.

MURALIST DRAWS TRIBUTE, EMPATHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day on my way to work I pass the beautiful mural that Kent Twitchell has 
been painting on the wall near the Manchester off-ramp from the northbound San 
Diego Freeway. This mural is the most enjoyable part of my daily drive because 
I recognize the talent, work, training and skill necessary to bring it to life. 
I am the daughter, daughter-in-law, wife and mother of artists, two of them 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last week, I was jolted by the impotent gesture of graffiti that some 
idiot had sprayed onto the mural. It sickens me that there are people who are 
so dead set against beauty in the world and would destroy the efforts of people 
who contribute their talent to the enjoyment of everyone. And it saddens me 
even more that Mr. Twitchell would withhold his abilities because of these few 
imbeciles. However, I certainly understand his hurt and frustration at the 
unwarranted destruction of his work, and I would also understand why we would 
lose future contracts with him. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you decide, Mr. Twitchell, please know that millions of us support 
your work, even though we may not always speak out. By the same token, we will 
support your decision not to subject yourself to such indignities, should you 
so choose. However, your work will be missed, and we'll all be poorer for the 
lack of it.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EVA SNOW CLEARED OF CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eva Snow, a South Bay Hospital District board member and wife of former Redondo 
Beach City Councilman Archie Snow, has been cleared of charges that she was 
driving under the influence when her car rear-ended another earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office agreed to drop the charges Tuesday in South Bay 
Municipal Court after conceding that blood tests after the Jan. 17 crash showed 
that Snow was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing Tuesday, Snow pleaded no contest to a charge that she was 
following too closely when the accident occurred. She will pay $185 in 
penalties, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Puentes. No one was injured in 
the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell under suspicion of drunk driving when a Redondo Beach police officer 
who witnessed the accident reported that her speech was slurred and that she 
staggered when she walked. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Steven Berman said that Snow might have behaved oddly because 
she had just received distressing news. An employee at South Bay Hospital had 
called her to say that her husband, who was in the hospital for a heart 
condition, had gone into cardiac arrest, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
Snow had been napping when she received the call, Berman said. "Any impairment 
in her driving was due to sleep, distress and worry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The former councilman later recovered.

MAN CONVICTED OF RESTAURANT OWNER'S SLAYING DURING HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three hours of deliberation, a San Fernando Superior Court jury found a 
24-year-old Lake View Terrace man guilty of first degree murder Wednesday in 
the killing of a Sunland restaurant owner during an attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Taylor, who was attempting to rob a Pioneer Chicken restaurant on 
Foothill Boulevard, fatally shot Lewis Lim in the back of the head as Lim tried 
to flee out the back door in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Lim, 33, a Chinese immigrant, had purchased the fast-food restaurant just two 
months earlier with money he saved while working as a butcher. His wife, Cindy, 
bore the couple's third child a week after her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Although the murder occurred during an attempted robbery -- a special 
circumstance that could bring the death penalty -- prosecutors decided not to 
seek Taylor's execution because they had no witnesses who saw the killing, only 
the events preceding and following Lim's death. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who was convicted of another robbery in 1984 and of attempting to 
possess a weapon in prison, under the law must be sentenced to life in state 
prison without possibility of parole, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Richman. He 
will be sentenced Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
None of Lim's family, who continue to operate the restaurant, were present to 
hear the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was impassive as the verdict was read, but then told Judge Ronald S. 
Coen that he wanted to "say his piece" and tell the jurors that "I hope they 
really found in their hearts that I am guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Four witnesses -- two of Lim's employees, a customer and a woman who was in the 
parking lot of the mini-mall -- testified during the 3-week trial. Richman 
argued that their descriptions of Taylor's actions at the restaurant clearly 
fit the pattern of a robbery, despite defense contentions that Taylor might 
have killed Lim for some other reason. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor entered the restaurant about 3:10 p.m. and asked employee Rajinder Kaur 
for the key to a bathroom located outside the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Augustin Dominquez, who was flown in from Guadalajara, Mexico, to testify, said 
he was in the parking lot and watched as Taylor entered the bathroom, closed 
the door slightly and peered out into the parking lot. Dominquez said Taylor 
then went back into the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carried Gun 
</P>
<P>
Kaur, testifying through a Punjabi interpreter, said Taylor came behind the 
counter with the key in one hand and pointing a gun at her with the other. Lim 
emerged from the kitchen and began shouting at Taylor, saying he was not 
allowed in the employee area of the restaurant. Taylor whirled to face Lim and 
Kaur fled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lim was found with a single bullet wound in the head at the back door of the 
restaurant. He died later that day. No money was taken, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was arrested by Los Angeles police more than four months later, in 
March, 1988, after his palm print was found on the back of the rear-view mirror 
of a car identified as the getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
The car had been stolen the afternoon of the killing and abandoned afterward. 
Police said they found items stolen from the car at Taylor's house. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Duarte testified that she was in the parking lot when she heard shots and 
saw Taylor run out of the restaurant and speed away in the car. 
</P>
<P>
A second man who sat in the restaurant eating area and served as a lookout 
during the robbery has not been identified. Taylor has refused to divulge 
information about his accomplice, who also fled in the getaway car, Richman 
said.

STATE CLOSES DAY-CARE CENTER AFTER REPORT OF MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day-care center run by the estranged wife of Santa Clarita City Councilman 
Dennis Koontz has been temporarily shut down by the state because of 
allegations that five preschoolers were sexually molested at the facility, a 
state official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A complaint by the Department of Social Services does not accuse Mary Lee 
Koontz of involvement in the alleged molestations, but says she should have 
provided better supervision at the center she operated in her Juneda Drive 
home, said Kathleen Norris, a department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint does not mention the councilman, who has been separated from his 
wife for more than a year. They are seeking a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lee Koontz could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A report compiled by the department said the molestations occured between 1983 
and 1987 and involved both boys and girls, Norris said. The molestations were 
allegedly committed by an older boy, Norris said. She said the boy was not an 
employee at the center, but would not elaborate on his connection to it. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, responding to complaints, notified 
the state of the alleged incidents in March, Norris said. She said she did not 
know what, if any, action had been taken against the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department investigators could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Norris said the state issued the complaint against Mary Lee Koontz on May 19, 
closing the center at the same time. The state will ask that the center's 
license be revoked at a hearing before an administrative law judge scheduled 
for Dec. 6-8. The center will remain closed until the hearing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lee Koontz had operated a day-care center since 1983 but did not obtain a 
license, which authorized her to care for up to 12 children, until Feb. 3 of 
this year, Norris said.

FAULTY SPRINKLERS MAY RAIN ON NEW CONVENTION CENTER'S OPENING PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Fire Department inspection of the San Diego Convention Center has 
found a faulty sprinkler system, which could delay the center's Nov. 1 opening 
until repairs are completed, convention center and fire officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkler heads on the meeting-room level and in the main ballroom are 
obstructed by hanging lights, said Fire Marshal Jim Sewell. In the event of a 
fire, water from the sprinklers in certain areas would be blocked by the 
lights, Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wilkens, a spokesman for the San Diego Unified Port District, said it is 
not known whether the center will be finished on time. He said that, although 
the Port District is concerned, it has no reason to believe that Fire 
Department officials and general contractor Tutor-Saliba-Perini will not be 
able to work things out. "I think we're always concerned about unforeseen 
problems that come out. We'll just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
The problem must be corrected before the building can be occupied. Fire 
officials are meeting with Tutor-Saliba-Perini representatives to discuss 
alternatives, Sewell said. The inspection was made about two weeks ago. 
</P>

"The lights were not in the original plans we had originally approved," Sewell 
said, adding that the sprinkler heads would have to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkens said the Port District had not received an estimate from 
Tutor-Saliba-Perini on how much the repairs would cost, and he didn't know who 
would pay. Bill Pence, a vice president with the contracting company, said the 
alterations would cost $200,000 to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, union laborers held a one-day sickout in protest of the hiring of 
non-union workers by Tutor-Saliba-Perini to install flooring, Pence said. The 
sickout was not expected to affect the center's completion deadline, and union 
laborers are expected to return to work today, an insider said.

2 ARRESTED IN GLENDALE AFTER CHASE ON 6 FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men suspected of robbing stores in Cerritos and Long Beach were arrested 
Wednesday evening in a parking lot of the Glendale Galleria shopping center 
after a 40-minute pursuit on six freeways, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
During the chase, the men allegedly fired a gun at a California Highway Patrol 
car, said Sgt. George Boswell of the Lakewood Sheriff's station. There were no 
reports of injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, whose names were not immediately available, tried to flee after 
abandoning the allegedly stolen vehicle, but police arrested them at Central 
Avenue and Harvard Street, Boswell said. 
</P>
<P>
A shotgun, a handgun and an unspecified amount of cash were found in the car, 
Boswell said. The weapons were believed to have been used in a robbery shortly 
after 7 p.m. at the Robinson's department store in the Los Cerritos Center mall 
in Cerritos, Boswell said. 
</P>
<P>
The men and the car in which they fled matched a description of two suspects 
and a vehicle involved in a robbery in Long Beach earlier Wednesday in which 
shots were fired, Boswell said. Details of the Long Beach robbery were 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began in Cerritos after deputies were alerted to the robbery, Boswell 
said. Officers pursued the car at speeds up to 85 m.p.h. on the Artesia, Long 
Beach, San Bernardino, Golden State, Pasadena and Ventura freeways, Boswell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The car left the Pasadena Freeway in South Pasadena, where it was involved in a 
minor traffic accident, Boswell said. The suspects entered the Ventura Freeway, 
took the Central Avenue exit in Glendale a short time later and drove south 
before stopping at the Galleria, Boswell said.

DOW PAYS FINE OVER STATE CITATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM LACKED PERMITS TO BURN, STORE HAZARDOUS WASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dow Chemical Co. USA has paid a $117,000 fine after being cited for breaking 
state health laws by burning and storing hazardous waste at its Torrance 
polystyrene manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
The March 31 citation also charged Dow with 11 other violations, including 
failure to label hazardous waste containers properly and failure to make 
emergency arrangements with Torrance Police and Fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the fine was for treating hazardous waste without the proper permit 
and for the storage of wastes in Torrance that came from a Dow facility in Long 
Beach, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Smalling, Dow manager of safety and environmental affairs, said the 
company maintains that its permit did allow burning of waste, but Dow has paid 
the fine rather than get entangled in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time do we feel that we improperly handled our hazardous waste or 
endangered the surrounding public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Major Violations 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Health Services spokesman Jim Marxen said the violations 
did not directly threaten public health. He said the two major violations 
involved failure to have the proper permits for what Dow was doing. 
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the state Department of Health Services, Dow is continuing 
to burn waste at its Torrance plant in the 300 block of Crenshaw Boulevard 
while applying for a permit that specifically allows incinerating some of the 
wastes produced there. 
</P>
<P>
The incineration issue concerns hydrocarbon wastes, including styrene, 
partially polymerized styrene and ethyl benzene, which are produced during the 
manufacturing of polystyrene. Smalling said the plant makes "several hundred 
million pounds" of polystyrene a year, commonly used in packing material and 
food containers. 
</P>
<P>
He said the waste from the polystyrene process, which can be as much as 576,000 
pounds a year, has been burned to heat a plant boiler ever since the Department 
of Health Services issued a permit to Dow in 1983 covering the processes at the 
plant. The permit states that "recovered hydrocarbons" would be used as boiler 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wastes Burned 
</P>
<P>
But during an inspection on Feb. 16, 1989, health services inspector Teena 
Suzuki noticed that the wastes were burned. Suzuki said she considered Dow's 
burning of the waste chemicals "a form of treatment," for which Dow did not 
have a permit. She cited Dow for it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed Inspection 
</P>
<P>
However, Smalling said that the plant passed a health services inspection in 
1987 without any similar citation and that it has complied with limitations on 
air pollution imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said Dow officials had pointed to the earlier inspection and the 
language of the 1983 permit when informed that a citation was going to be 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
Marxen said treatment must be specifically addressed in a permit. "If Dow had 
wanted treatment, and we had agreed to treatment, it would have said 
'treatment.' We have nothing against the boiler unit" but it needs a treatment 
permit and the inspections that would follow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Department of Health Services had not cited Dow after its 1987 
inspection, Suzuki said: "Some inspectors will see things that others don't." 
She added that the 1983 permit may have been faulty in including the language 
that Dow cited as authority to burn hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
The storage issue arises because Dow's permit only allows the company to store 
hazardous waste at the Torrance facility that is generated there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Material Shipped 
</P>
<P>
Smalling acknowledged that Dow had been storing hazardous waste generated at a 
Dow bulk liquid storage terminal in Long Beach. That material was not burned in 
Torrance but was shipped, along with other waste chemicals from the Torrance 
operation, to Louisiana or Texas where Dow has incinerator plants. 
</P>
<P>
The hazardous waste from the Long Beach facility consisted mainly of used 
filter cartridges, samples, styrene, ethyl benzene, partially polymerized 
styrene, acetone and methylene chloride. 
</P>
<P>
Smalling said Dow used the Torrance plant for storage because "the Long Beach 
terminal is an arm of this operation. We looked at it as a satellite site." 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said: "They misinterpreted the permit on the storage." 
</P>
<P>
Smalling said Dow now sends waste directly from the Long Beach terminal to its 
incineration plants in Louisiana and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interests of resolving the problem and getting on with correcting any 
deficiencies we may have had and assuring that the public health and welfare is 
maintained in the most efficient manner, we are going ahead with the 
corrections," Smalling said. 
</P>
<P>
Health agency officials said Dow was cited for the 11 other infractions because 
Dow failed to keep adequate records or file with local public safety officials 
information that would enable them to handle an emergency at the plant.

TENNIS AT MANHATTAN BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
MARTINA BACK IN TOP FORM, 6-3, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What is the tennis version of Showtime? 
</P>
<P>
Why, it's the Martina Navratilova Show, featuring serves speedier than a Laker 
fast break, lobs taller than Magic Johnson on tiptoes and volleys deeper than 
Pat Riley's inner thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
There's no place like Los Angeles to put on a show, playing tennis all the 
while, says Navratilova, who ought to know because she has been coming here and 
knocking balls around since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Isabelle Demongeot got in the way of Navratilova's 
performance, but not for long. 
</P>
<P>
Under the lights, Navratilova scored a 6-3, 6-2 second-round victory in the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles and the winner thought it was a pretty good show. 
But it always has to be, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is L.A.," Navratilova said. "You people are really critical here. You're 
used to the very best in entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm aware of a need to perform well. If you're playing in a city where you 
don't get much stuff, smaller places people are thrilled to see you, period. 
You can just about miss every shot and they're still clapping. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, it's different." 
</P>
<P>
At 33, it's the same old Navratilova. Well, almost. She feels like she's in 
pretty good shape after training in Aspen, Colo., by riding her bicycle up 
hills and lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
But she was playing her first match since losing to Steffi Graf in the 
Wimbledon final and her first on a hardcourt since the Australian Open in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Except for one game in which she double-faulted three times, 
Navratilova showed a formidable serve, a whole bunch of well-timed returns and 
enough sharp volleys to keep Demongeot, 23, in perpetual trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Demongeot, of France, went for big first serves, but did not get a high 
percentage of them in, so Navratilova wound up with what she called a 
"comfortable" victory. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Navratilova had to weather only one rough spot, that one when she was 
broken in the first game of the second set after three double faults three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
She blamed her five-week layoff for that game, which she traced to rustiness. 
</P>
<P>
Demongeot was suitably impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's still good," Demongeot said. 
</P>
<P>
Distracting, too, she said. Navratilova played to the audience at Manhattan 
Country Club a couple of times -- spanking herself with her racket after 
missing a drop shot and deliberately hitting a ball to a man in the stands 
after he had dropped a ball hit to him just before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," Demongeot said. "She's talking to the public and everything 
and it's a show." 
</P>
<P>
No kidding, Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
"If she's aware of it, she shouldn't be," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
How long, Hana? 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, she was a member of that exclusive club, the top 10, checking in 
at No. 5. Now, Hana Mandlikova thinks she is going to be there again. 
</P>
<P>
She just isn't sure when. 
</P>
<P>
"It took (John) McEnroe two years," said the 18th-ranked Mandlikova. "It might 
take me a year, two years. It might take me six months." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, that's how long her second set seemed Tuesday in an up, down and up 
again, 6-1, 0-6, 6-2, third-round victory over Amy Frazier, 17, of Rochester 
Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how it looked -- double fault at 0-5 and overhead into the net on set 
point -- Mandlikova said it wasn't a matter of her taking a nose-dive in the 
second set as much as it was Frazier firing winners past her. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept hitting bullets at me," Mandlikova said. 
</P>
<P>
There is one bullet heading in Mandlikova's direction that she might not be 
able to dodge: Martina Navratilova, who must first defeat Terry Phelps today. 
</P>
<P>
Mandlikova is 0-4 against Navratilova this year and has not won a set. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver lost her serve once and it cost her the first set, then took out 
her aggression on Claudia Porwick of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver advanced to the quarterfinals with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, victory, allowing 
Porwick only 11 points in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova said she hasn't necessarily closed the door forever on Pam 
Shriver as a doubles partner. "This is not a permanent situation," Navratilova 
said. "It's way up in the air." . . . Meanwhile, Shriver has discovered that if 
she has extra time on her hands from not playing doubles, then fishing is a lot 
of fun. Shriver recently taken up angling. "I think it's a great hobby except 
when you have to take the hook out of the fish's mouth." Shriver is working 
with a new coach, Jason Goodall, 22, who was once the No. 2-ranked player in 
England. . . . Women's tennis historian Ted Tinling received the Billie Jean 
King Award for service to women's tennis.

CHANG UPSET IN STRAIGHT SETS BY NO. 113-RANKED JASON STOLTENBERG

<P>
Top-seeded Michael Chang continued his struggles Wednesday as the French Open 
champion was defeated by Jason Stoltenberg, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), in the second round 
of the Swiss Army Knife Open at Livingston, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second consecutive tournament that Chang, the world's 
fifth-ranked player, has played poorly. He looked bad in both his matches here 
against players not even ranked in the top 100 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Chang needed three sets to defeat Scott Warner, No. 199, in the first round 
Tuesday and then lost to Stoltenberg, the No. 113 player who was the world's 
No. 1 junior in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't hit the shots I wanted to hit," said Chang, who said he has 
not recovered from a two-week vacation after Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Australian broke Chang twice in the first set and gained a 4-1 
lead before eventually serving out the match at love. 
</P>
<P>
In other second-round action, fourth-seeded Jim Courier won 12 of the final 13 
points to score a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Alex Antonitsch of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Courier, 18, has lost only five games in his first two matches. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bailey, the No. 2 singles player in England, also advanced to the 
quarterfinals with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Rich Fromberg of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg, showing the effects of a layoff since losing to Boris Becker in 
the Wimbledon final, struggled past Danie Visser of South Africa, 6-4, 6-4, in 
the U.S. Hardcourts at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I always find it hard to get (back) into it," the top-seeded Edberg said. "I 
will feel a lot better (today). 
</P>
<P>
"It's always tough to play a left-hander. I knew (Visser) was going to be 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg took the first set after breaking Visser in the seventh game, and took 
command with another break in the ninth game of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, second-seeded John McEnroe routed Dan Cassidy 6-2, 6-2; No. 3 
Tim Mayotte defeated Jimmy Arias, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2; No. 4 Aaron Krickstein routed 
Diego Nargiso of Italy, 6-1, 6-4; Todd Witsken beat Vijay Amritraj of India, 
7-6 (8-6), 6-3, and David Pate upset 16th-seeded Richey Reneberg, 6-4, 3-6, 
6-2.

SCHMITT TRIES TO MAKE POINT STAND UP IN CLOSE RACE TO FINISH

What is at the moment the closest race in the 36-year history of the NASCAR 
Winston West championship series will return to Saugus Speedway after an 
absence of 12 years Saturday night for a 200-lap main event on the 
one-third-mile paved oval. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schmitt, 53, two-time champion from Redding, leads defending champion Roy 
Smith of Canada by 1,325 points to 1,324, with rookie Bill Sedgwick of Van Nuys 
at 1,269 and 61-year-old Hershel McGriff, 1986 champion, at 1,221. 
</P>
<P>
The closest finish was in 1968, when Scotty Cain edged Ray Elder by two points. 
More recently, Jim Robinson nosed out Derrike Cope by four points in 1984, and 
Schmitt finished five points ahead of the late Tim Williamson in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Only two races remain after Saugus, Sept. 24 on the road course at Sears Point, 
and Nov. 5 as part of the Winston Cup's Auto Works 500 at Phoenix International 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 45, closed to within a point of Schmitt when he drove his Ford to 
victory in the Coors 200 last Saturday night at Bakersfield's Mesa Marin 
Raceway. Fading brakes in Schmitt's Chevrolet caused him to drop back to third, 
behind Sedgwick, on the last lap. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands seven times between Smith and Schmitt over the final 81 
laps, before Smith won by 0.6 second in a four-car blanket finish. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who won consecutive championships in 1980-82, dropped out of racing for 
four years to work as a commercial fisherman in Victoria, British Columbia, 
then returned to the series in 1987. Last year, he won his fourth championship. 
Only Elder, the racing farmer from Caruthers, Calif., who won six between 1969 
and 1975, has won more. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick, 34, has been the surprise of the season. He finished better than 
fifth only once in 11 previous Winston West races over nine years and was 
better known as the jack man for McGriff's crew in the early '80s and as 
co-crew chief for Roman Calczynski last year when Calczynski won the Southwest 
Tour championship. 
</P>
<P>
After the first three races of the $1.3-million 11-race season, Sedgwick 
appeared likely to become the first driver to win the championship and become 
rookie of the year in the same season. He won the opener at Madera and repeated 
two races later at Eureka, opening a wide lead, but lost ground when he failed 
to qualify for the first Sears Point race. 
</P>
<P>
He will be more at home in the 66.6-mile race at Saugus, where he was a 
Saturday night regular in sportsman cars before electing to run the Winston 
West season. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure doesn't hurt to be running at what we consider our home track," 
Sedgwick said. "They aren't kidding when they call Saugus the action track, and 
I can guarantee the heat of a close championship will provide even more action 
than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Winston West cars have not raced on the saucer-like oval since 1977, when Jim 
Thirkettle of Sylmar, now on the Southwest Tour, won, with Schmitt third. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff, who drove in his first NASCAR race in 1950, won a Winston West race at 
Saugus in 1972 -- when Sedgwick was 7. 
</P>
<P>
When McGriff won last May at Mesa Marin in his Pontiac, it was his 35th Winston 
West checkered flag and snapped an 18-month losing streak. He also was the 
highest West Coast finisher in the Sears Point Winston Cup race last June. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-lap event will be the longest nonstop race ever held at Saugus. Races 
such as the Saugus 330 always were split into two segments. Because of the 
length, track officials have installed a pit area where cars can refuel or 
change tires. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's program will also include a 40-lap sportsman main event and a 
train race. The starting time has been moved up an hour to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- California Racing Assn. drivers will get a bonus Saturday night 
at Ascot Park when they run for points in the Budweiser American Challenge 
Series as well as the season-long Parnelli Jones Firestone series. Brad 
Noffsinger won the first of the three Budweiser races. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- Robby Flock and Sleepy Tripp, after a barnstorming trip to United 
States Auto Club races in the Midwest, return home this week for a Jolly 
Ranchers Western States race Sunday night at Ascot Park. Flock and Tripp 
finished 1-2 in Lincoln, Neb., and Flock picked up a second at Denver. 
Three-quarter midgets will share the program. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD -- The Pahrump Station Nevada 500, sixth stop on the High Desert 
Racing Assn./SCORE series, is expected to have more than 200 entries when it 
starts Saturday morning in Pahrump, 50 miles west of Las Vegas. Bob Richey, a 
plumbing contractor from Corona who was the overall winner of the Fireworks 
250, will be first off the line at 8 a.m. Drivers will run a 470-mile loop on 
existing dirt roads to Tonopah in central Nevada and back to Pahrump. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The Continental Motosport Club will start a three-event Ascot 
Night Challenge series Friday night at the Gardena track. . . . The seventh

MANHATTAN BEACH'S JEFF TARANGO FACED JIM PUGH IN HIS PRO DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Court 16 of the All-England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club is a strange place 
to see a familiar face. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when you have traveled thousands of miles to make your professional 
tennis debut on one of the world's most famous rectangles of grass. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Jeff Tarango of Manhattan Beach, 20 years old and fresh from the halls 
of Stanford University. On a rainy day in late June, Tarango stood in the 
shadow of Wimbledon's fabled Centre Court -- where Boris Becker would later win 
his third singles title -- staring across the lawn at Jim Pugh, a veteran pro 
from just around the corner in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird," Tarango said. "Going all that way to turn pro, and then you 
play someone who lives four miles from you." 
</P>
<P>
Pugh beat his younger neighbor in four sets. But Tarango had scored a victory 
of his own. Even though he lost his debut, Tarango spent his first few hours as 
a tennis professional amid pageantry, royalty and strawberries and cream. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough not to get caught up in all the prestige of the tournament," 
Tarango said. "I suppose it comes with experience -- to treat Wimbledon as just 
another tennis match. But I was mesmerized by the whole thing. It was my first 
Wimbledon. The tradition just catches up with you." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy to catch up with Tarango anymore. Since turning pro just before 
Wimbledon in June, the Mira Costa High School graduate has been earning his 
living in men's tournaments on the Eastern seaboard. He has made four stops 
since Wimbledon, from Rhode Island to Washington. His sixth pro tournament is 
the North American Tennis Open this week at Livingston, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my future for a while," said Tarango, who is now ranked No. 84 in the 
world. "Tennis is my livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
Tarango has always been serious. At Stanford, between leading the Cardinal to 
two NCAA championships, Tarango posted a 3.1 grade-point average as a 
philosophy major. 
</P>
<P>
Tarango also entered nine professional tournaments over the last year and won 
the Wanetka Pro Classic in Evanston, Ill., a $50,000 event, as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
At this time last year, Tarango was battling Andre Agassi in the final of the 
Livingston tournament. He lost, 6-3, 6-4, but would have pocketed $10,000 for 
reaching the final if not for his amateur status. And he would have made $7,000 
for his victory at Evanston. The winnings that Tarango bypassed "more than 
would have paid for his tuition," said Stanford tennis Coach Dick Gould. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're playing as an amateur, you don't recognize the money as much," 
Tarango said. "I was playing against guys who were playing for a living, so I 
was really loose. It was more of an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Tarango upset Australian Peter Doohan in the first round of the 
Australian Open in January, his ranking had risen to No. 88 on the Assn. of 
Tennis Professionals computer. When he returned to Stanford, by virtue of his 
computer ranking, Tarango was the No. 1 amateur in the world. 
</P>
<P>
That's when he decided to turn professional. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized I came back to college for the college experience and not for the 
improvement of my tennis," Tarango said. "I decided I couldn't keep cutting 
myself short of my dream of becoming a pro tennis player. I could have had fun 
in college, but I had to be responsible and I didn't want to waste my talent. 
That would be a hard thing to live with, I think." 
</P>
<P>
So Tarango finished his junior year at Stanford. He went 17-8 as Stanford's No. 
1 singles player and lost in the first round of the NCAA singles championships 
to Southern Methodist's Brian Devening. 
</P>
<P>
Tarango and partner Alex O'Brien became the top-ranked college doubles team in 
the nation, going undefeated until they were beaten in the NCAA semifinals -- 
college tennis' Final Four -- by Trevor Kronemann and Mike Briggs of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Tarango was named Stanford's scholar-athlete this year. He has always been a 
serious student: At Mira Costa, where he won the Southern Section 4-A singles 
title in 1986 under Coach Jeff Verner, Tarango managed a 3.7 GPA and was 
selected as an academic All-American. Still, tennis beckoned, and he left 
Stanford and his studies of the existentialist philosopher Albert Camus a year 
short of graduation. 
</P>
<P>
He has had company with him on the road to ease his mind. His father, Bob, is 
traveling with him now through the tournaments on the East Coast. His mother, 
Mary, went with him to Wimbledon and the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
"His father and I kind of take turns traveling with him," Mary Tarango said. 
"At Wimbledon, we were both very much in awe of it. Jeff lost, but it was still 
neat to have a son participating in all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the stabilizing presence of his family, Tarango said his mother 
helps to analyze his game. She taught him the fundamentals of tennis before 
turning him over for coaching with Robert Lansdorp at Torrance's West End 
Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
"She checks up on my game and keeps me regimented," Tarango said. "She taught 
me the basic things before I took lessons, and she made tennis fun for me 
instead of something I should be doing. I always hated team sports, but she 
made me play baseball and soccer just so I would be sure that I wanted to play 
tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Tarango keeps a cool presence on the court. He's a left-handed counterpuncher 
who likes to patrol the baseline. And he's a smart player -- he oftens sets up 
points with his ground strokes and then comes in behind his big, wicked 
forehand. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff is able to forget a loss very quickly," Gould said. "He's resilient, and 
he doesn't dwell on things. Some pro players start questioning themselves after 
they've taken a few losses in the Top 100. But Jeff has the inner makeup to 
avoid the downs -- he can just snap right out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Tarango has taken some lumps in his first few weeks as a pro. But he's also 
dished out a few. 
</P>
<P>
He overwhelmed Sammy Giammalva in the first round of the Volvo Tennis Hall of 
Fame in Newport, R.I., his second tournament as a pro. But in the second round, 
Tarango was beaten in straight sets by a grass-court veteran, Peter Lundgren of 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
He reached the quarterfinals of his next event, the $200,000 OTB International 
in Schenectady, N.Y. Tarango blitzed past Canada's Grant Connell and India's 
Vijay Amritraj in the first two rounds, dropping only 13 games in the two 
matches. But in the quarters, he ran into Stanford alum Dan Goldie, the 1986 
NCAA singles champ, and lost 1-6, 7-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
That performance earned Tarango the 16th seed in the Sovran Bank Classic in 
Washington, D.C., the next week, but he was upset in the second round by Gary 
Muller of South Africa in 106-degree heat. Tarango dropped seven straight games 
in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"It was way too hot," Tarango said. "It may have been 106 in the shade, but it 
was 140 degrees on the court. It just baked up off the surface like a 
microwave." 
</P>
<P>
It was a bit cooler in Stratton Mountain, Vt., in last week's Volvo 
International, but Tarango met a cool reception from seeded Jay Berger, who 
knocked him off in three sets. After the Livingston tournament, Tarango will go 
to Montreal for the Players International Canadian Open, then play an 
exhibition in New York as a final tuneup for the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just one or two or three points away from where I want to be," Tarango 
said. "A couple of those points could swing a whole match in my favor. I'm 
playing well; it's just a matter of breaking through on the big points."

CATCHER KEEPS BIG LEAGUE DREAMS ALIVE AFTER FIVE FRUSTRATING MINOR SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1985 as a high first-round draft 
choice with a reported six-figure bonus, catcher Kurt Brown of Glendora never 
envisioned it taking him long to reach the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the fifth player chosen in the draft, thought it would not take more 
than four years of minor league baseball to reach the promised land of Comiskey 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
But by this season, his fifth in pro baseball, the only place Brown's career 
appeared to be headed was in circles. 
</P>
<P>
Especially since Brown is once again playing in Sarasota, Fla., where his pro 
career began in rookie ball as an 18-year-old with the Sarasota White Sox of 
the Gulf Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Only the second stop at Sarasota is a little more promising. He is playing for 
the Sarasota White Sox of the Florida State League -- the highest of Chicago's 
three Class A farm teams -- and even had a brief fling this year with 
Birmingham in the Class AA Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important is that Brown is hitting. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of struggling, the 6-2 and 215-pound Brown is finally coming 
of age as a hitter, his most glaring weakness. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a month remaining in the season, Brown is enjoying his best 
season with a .286 batting average, two home runs and 22 RBIs in 220 at bats. 
He recently completed a 22-game hitting streak and batted .338 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Brown batted .205 for the Sarasota rookie team in 1985; .234 for Appleton, 
Wis., of the Class A Midwest League in 1986; .253 for Peninsula (Norfolk, Va.) 
of the Class A Carolina League in 1987 and a combined .212 for South Bend, 
Ind., of the Midwest League and Tampa of the Florida State League in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It had been a frustrating road through the low minors for Brown, who as a 
senior at Glendora High turned down a football scholarship to Long Beach State 
in 1985 to fulfill his ambition of making the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Brown realizes that he may have become caught up in naivete, although the dream 
is alive. 
</P>
<P>
"When I signed I didn't know anything," he says. "I figured four years. But now 
I realize that was a little low. But I'm still young. I'm only 22. When you 
look at the number of seasons I've played I'm a veteran, but I'm still young 
according to my age." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slow progress, Brown is convinced that he made the right decision 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no regrets and I've been to college since then," he said. "I know some 
guys that played college football and I think I made the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is attending Citrus College in Glendora during the off-season, said 
it was a difficult decision but added that there are no guarantees attached to 
a college degree, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I have friends who went to school and got their degrees and don't have a job," 
he said. "I went out into the real world and tried to make it. I'm not saying 
anything against them, but there's a big difference between working in the real 
world and going to college. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot different going to college and playing and just having fun and 
going to the pros to play. You're on your own here. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen guys get left behind because they miss the bus, and it's just too 
bad. In college you make an error and they tell you to go run (laps). Here they 
fine you $25 or something. It's money out of your pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the transition from high school to minor league baseball was 
difficult, "but I've been in it longer now so I know the ins and outs a little 
better." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first realizations for Brown was that he wouldn't be able to swing 
for power as he did in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to adjust my swing," he said. "When I started I was more of a pull 
and up-the-middle hitter. Now I'm more of a gap and alley hitter. My biggest 
improvement has been not getting myself out. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitching is pretty good, but you have to learn to make adjustments at the 
plate. When a pitcher is throwing you nasty stuff, you have to learn to fight 
it off until you can get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just realized what I want to do as a hitter. You approach it one at-bat 
at a time, one pitch at a time. You simplify the game." 
</P>
<P>
He credits Pat Roessler, hitting instructor with the White Sox, with improving 
his batting form and mental approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked with Pat a lot and can't see myself struggling again as I did 
before," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Franklin, first-year manager of the Sarasota White Sox, said Brown also 
deserves much of the credit for his improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been very consistent and that's because he's a very hard worker," 
Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more aware of what hitting is all about. I think he has become a better 
hitter since the start of the year. He's learning what it takes to become a 
good hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, Brown has put in the practice to become a success. 
</P>
<P>
"They have you working every day from 3:30 to about 11," he said. The practice 
regiment usually includes hitting drills and warm-up exercises until the game 
at 7. 
</P>
<P>
"You put in the hard work every day and you know that once you get in a game 
you're ready. It's like I'll hit 150 curveballs or so in practice, so I know I 
can hit it in a game," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun again because every time I come up now I know that even if I get out 
I'm not going to get cheated. I know I'm going to finish up the year at .300 or 
just about." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin says Brown has a good future as a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something there with his hitting and he doesn't appear to be a guy 
who's going to slack off," Franklin said. "He's always working hard at it, and 
that's important." 
</P>
<P>
Brown also thinks that getting married has helped him at the ballpark. He 
married his high school sweetheart, Marnie Axton, about a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier just because when you're living with other guys on the team 
it's chaotic," he said. "You come home from the ballpark and it's like you 
didn't leave the ballpark. The guys are pulling the same kind of pranks that 
they do at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you come home and you can relax more. It's real easy to take the game home 
with you, but you just learn to push it aside and get on with your life." 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox player is hoping that he has matured enough, both on and off the 
field, to earn a promotion to Chicago's Class AA team in Birmingham next 
season. He had a brief stay with Birmingham in May, catching two games in five 
days with the Southern League team. 
</P>
<P>
He knew from the start that his stay in Birmingham would not be long. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just that they had some doubleheaders and needed another catcher," 
Brown said. "So they called me. I went one for six but I don't think that's a 
good indication. I think I can do real well in that league." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the prospect is good that he will advance to double A by next year. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind I know I'm ready for double A," he said. "It just might not be with 
the White Sox. But they have to make that decision. They'll know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Brown admits he is a little tired of playing single A baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He said he likes Sarasota more than any other place he has played, although 
that is hardly a glowing recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the towns I played in, this is probably the nicest," he said. "I hated 
Appleton, Tampa was a sewer but South Bend wasn't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
He said he enjoys playing in Sarasota's Smith Complex, a new facility. But he 
has not grown accustomed to the intense humidity of Sarasota. 
</P>
<P>
"It always seems to be between 95 and 98 degrees and humid and I'm just dying 
out there," he said. "It's like you just smoked a pack of cigarettes. It's been 
that way most of the season. The first month of the season it was bad, but now 
it's really bad." 
</P>
<P>
As long as he can remain hot with the bat, Brown is hopeful that he won't have 
to contend with the humidity of Sarasota next season.

CAMARILLO'S BRYAN TAKES STEPS TO HELP SON RESCUE HIS MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Farmer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Bryan of Camarillo doesn't hunker over his 10-year-old twins, Mike and 
Bob, while they play tennis. Nor does he lambaste his offspring after each 
missed shot or incessantly scream instructions from the sidelines. Unlike some 
hounding parents, Bryan, co-owner and pro at Cabrillo Racquet Club, prefers a 
laissez faire approach. 
</P>
<P>
Usually. 
</P>
<P>
There are times, however, when a match has gotten so out of hand that he feels 
compelled to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: 
</P>
<P>
Mike, who was ranked 96th in the nation in the 12-and-under division last year, 
won the first set, 7-5, over San Jose's Ryan Wolters last week in a U. S. 
Tennis Assn. match that pitted teams from Northern California against teams 
from Southern California. Wolters is ranked No. 1 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Wayne left for about 15 minutes to watch another match. When he 
returned, the second set was over and Mike, a victim of a 6-0 pounding, was 
sulking. 
</P>
<P>
"He was kind of whimpering. There were a few tears in the eyes," Bryan said. "I 
was down watching some other kids play and I come back and boom -- he's off the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Mike has won more than 100 trophies in five years of 
competition, Bryan intended to motivate rather than instruct his son when he 
spoke to him. Besides, he reasoned, his instructional talks usually backfired. 
"If I say, 'Hit a few drop shots.' I'll look over and every shot will be a drop 
shot," Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
He took Mike to the top of a staircase and delivered the speech. "I said, 'The 
match is going to be won or lost on your way down the stairs. He's Ryan 
Wolters, the No. 1 guy in the nation, but you're Mikey Bryan and you're a 
champion. . . Understand the pressure he's under and get down and kick his 
butt.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mike took the advice and the the final set, 7-5, to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was the first time that Mike had beaten a player ranked as high as 
Wolters, his father is trying to keep the match in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wayne: "It's fine to have the Lakers beat the Pistons in the regular 
season, but you'd much rather win in the seventh game of the World 
Championships. You've got to choose your spots." 
</P>
<P>
This week is a spot to choose -- Mike and Bob are playing in the USTA 
12-and-under national championships in San Diego. Mike was eliminated from the 
singles competition round of 32 Wednesday, losing, 6-1, 7-5, to Justin 
Gimelstob of Eastern Falls, N.J. Bob defeated Brandon Kramer of Reno, 6-0, 5-7, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The twins are seeded fifth in doubles and advanced to today's round of 32 teams 
by upsetting the fourth-seeded team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tour of duty: Karen Shin of Woodland Hills qualified for the $300,000 Virginia 
Slims of Los Angeles at the Manhattan Country Club before losing Monday in the 
first round to 10th-seeded Patty Fendick, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Shin, who graduated from Cal in June, was the 1985 Southern Section singles 
champion while attending Chaminade High. 
</P>
<P>
She has found the transition from collegiate to professional play easier than 
she anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the whole life style would be harder," said Shin, who stays in 
luxury hotels and plays in top-notch facilities on the circuit. "In college it 
was great, I had the team, the coach, the whole school supporting me. Now, I'm 
playing for me." 
</P>
<P>
Volvo sectionals: The USTA Volvo League Sectional Championships will be played 
Aug. 12-13 and 19-20 at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. The 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 
matches (according to the National Tennis Rating Program, which measures 
players on a scale of 1.0 to 7.0) will be played Saturday and Sunday. The 4.0 
and 4.5 matches will be played the following weekend. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
The captains of the women's Valley-area teams, which are composed of between 
eight and 14 members, include Marion Hill (3.0), Jeanie Reed (3.5), Pauline 
Avery (4.0) and Debbie Pittinger (4.5). Men's captains include John Lazetic 
(3.5), Jesse Valente (4.0) and Phillip Kent (4.5). 
</P>
<P>
Head games: For those who find their toughest competitor is between their ears, 
Adidas has reprinted Allen Fox's book, "If I'm the Better Player, Why Can't I 
Win?" The $8.95 paperback is available to the public and is also distributed at 
Adidas tennis camps. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, a resident of Calabasas who will begin his 13th season as men's coach at 
Pepperdine in the spring, says the cerebral aspect of tennis is often 
overlooked. "You can get further with a bad game and a good head than you can 
with a good game and a bad head," he said. "There are a number of things a 
successful competitor does that people are not aware of. This book goes through 
those techniques."

While Coach Dan Henning has yet to reveal the answer to the big question 
involving the Chargers' first exhibition game -- Who will start at quarterback? 
-- he did answer some smaller ones Wednesday at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he planned to play only about 48 of the 80 Chargers under contract 
in Sunday's noon game against Dallas at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't play with 80 guys, or it would be a mess," Henning said. "They won't 
get anything out of it. Rather than give bits and pieces, we're going to give 
extensive time to certain people." 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said he planned to use no more than five of the seven running 
backs who are in camp and that he planned to separate them depending on the 
situation. He said he likely would use two or three of the backs on first down, 
two others on third down and have two sets of backs for short-yardage and goal 
line situations. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he would not decide on which backs he will use in which situations 
until Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
But he did rule three players out of the game because of injuries -- center Don 
Macek (ankle sprain), inside linebacker Gary Plummer (sore leg) and running 
back Timmy Smith (ankle sprain). 
</P>
<P>
Dennis McKnight, who was moved to center from guard in mini-camp in the May, 
likely will start in place of Macek. His backup, rookie Courtney Hall, is 
recovering from an ankle sprain, so guard Dan Rosado could also play there. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Figaro, who started the final five games as a rookie last season after 
recovering from a back injury, should start in Plummer's place. 
</P>
<P>
As for his choice of quarterbacks, Henning has said he will reserve that 
decision until Thursday night or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The choices are David Archer, the free agent who started for Henning with the 
Atlanta Falcons in 1985 and 1986; incumbent Mark Malone, who started eight 
games last year, and rookie Billy Joe Tolliver, the second-round draft pick 
from Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson also is undecided about which quarterback he will 
start against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't structured anything as of yet," Johnson said in a conference call 
from the Dallas training camp in Thousand Oaks. "All three will play. We really 
won't identify who start at quarterback until right at game time. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's choices are a little more high-profile than the Chargers': Troy 
Aikman, the former UCLA star and first player selected in the draft; Steve 
Walsh, Johnson's quarterback at the University of Miami for the past two season 
and the first player taken in the supplemental draft last month, and Babe 
Laufenberg, the fourth-year journeyman who started the Chargers' 1988 
regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dana Brinson, eighth-round draft choice from Nebraska, sustained a hip pointer 
in the morning practice and did not participate in the afternoon workout. Coach 
Dan Henning said he did know when Brinson would return. Brinson, who was 
drafted as a wide receiver, is being looked at as a running back in third-down 
situations, Henning said. . . . Steve Ortmayer, Charger director of football 
operations, said he has talked in the past two days with representatives of the 
team's three holdouts -- rookie defensive end Burt Grossman and veterans Gary 
Anderson and Joe Phillips. Grossman, the first-round draft choice from Pitt, 
said he has been playing a lot of golf around Pittsburgh and looking forward to 
watching the Chargers' nationally televised exhibition with Dallas Sunday. "I'd 
prefer to be there," Grossman said. "But don't hold your breath." . . . At 
least a half-dozen players and Chet Franklin, the director of player personnel, 
left after the morning practice to attend memorial services in Los Angeles for 
Stacey Toran, the Raider safety killed in an automobile accident Saturday 
night. Most of the players were former teammates of Toran's with the Raiders. 
Franklin is a former Raider defensive backfield coach. They returned in time 
for the afternoon workout.

ERMA BOMBECK: HARD-EARNED AWARD IN NAME OF STUPIDITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The club for the Incredibly Stupid and Dumb Beyond Belief (ISDBB) was not 
founded by me. It was begun by a friend of mine in the East who thought there 
should be a tangible award for turning a simple situation into a disaster. You 
can't give a Heisman Trophy for something like that. 
</P>
<P>
So, a confession to such a deed is rewarded with a statue of a creature with a 
potbelly and a club in its hand. Someone had bought it at a garage sale. Like a 
torch, it is passed from one incompetent to another. 
</P>
<P>
My friend got it for sitting up all night in a living room chair waiting for 
her teen-age son to come home, only to learn after a restless night and a sore 
back that he had come in through the kitchen door around 11. 
</P>
<P>
She, in turn, passed it on to a friend who thought he left the lens cap to his 
new camera in a shop in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
After hours of retracing his steps to all the stores he had visited, he 
discovered the lens was retractable and opened and closed with a flip of the 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
The ugly ISDBB statue found its way west when my husband told them the story of 
how he left his passport on top of a hotel TV set in London and had to pay an 
empty cab $40 to pick it up and rush it to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
I can't remember the reason he sent it back East, but the statue broke in 
transit and he got it right back for being dumb enough to send it in a shoe box 
wrapped only in tissue in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
We have kept it ever since because we realized we had enough ISDBB candidates 
within our family to keep it moving briskly for the rest of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
My mother paid $3,000 to buy a battery-driven chair for my father to tool 
around the house, only to discover it wouldn't fit through the door frames. We 
didn't give her the ISDBB trophy until she sold the car for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pouring boiling water from a spaghetti pot down my stomach didn't make me 
stupid enough for the award. Telling my mother about it did. 
</P>
<P>
My daughter got it when she was sucking so hard on a Tootsie Roll with her 
tongue that it caused a blood blister to pop under her tongue. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days ago I was running barefoot through the house. I have made a 
million speeches to people who visit us in the desert about running around in 
bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of my more inspiring speeches. We have a lot of animals here who take 
a dim view of being stepped on. I stepped on a scorpion. 
</P>
<P>
In bed, with my foot on fire, I waited for the ugly statue with the potbelly 
and the club in its hand to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the family gathered around and said I would have permanent possession 
of the award. I had just been named to the Stupid Hall of Fame. They all 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
You'll excuse me if I don't get up.

FOR QUICK-STEPPING MILLIE O'GREEN, A NIGHT AT CIRCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the dance floor at benefits, Fred and Millie O'Green usually capture the 
limelight, gliding and smiling through their fox-trots and sambas. While he was 
chairman and CEO for eight years of Litton Industries, they cut a sassy swath 
on the social circuit, hosting corporate tables at myriad affairs; it hasn't 
stopped with his retirement a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Millie O'Green and Lois Linkletter (Art's wife), will be at the 
forefront of The League for Children (TLC) with a lot of tender loving care for 
the charity the ladies founded four years ago to aid abused and homeless 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, they'll honor Gunther Gebel-Williams in his farewell performance 
at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus TLC benefit in the Sports 
Arena. Sharon Black chairs the pre-dinner in The Clipper Club, and is hoping to 
net at least $100,000 by keeping costs to a slim 17%. Making it a family 
affair, Art Linkletter, as he has twice in the past, will be master of 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Iowa to D.C. 
</P>
<P>
For Millie O'Green, her charity work has been a way of life since she was 22. 
She and Fred were high school sweethearts in Mason City, Iowa. Two days after 
he graduated from Iowa State University at Ames, they were married and 
immediately moved to Washington for his new job as electronics engineer with 
the U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
As for Millie, "I went to work decoding secret messages for the British Air 
Commission, but I joined the Chevy Chase Women's Club because I wanted to get 
acquainted." Bucking the trend of her contemporaries, she worked most of the 13 
years they lived in Washington, while still having two children. "Basically I 
like business, and I like working." 
</P>
<P>
But the volunteer bug bit. When the O'Greens moved to Los Altos and later to 
Northridge 34 years ago, she switched to full-time volunteering, beginning with 
the Valley Presbyterian Hospital, spreading to the Assistance League and ARCS 
(Achievement Rewards for College Scientists). Subsequently, she has put her 
touch on fund-raisers for Diadames, the California Museum of Science Muses, the 
National Art Assn., Le Dames de Champagne, the Music Center Blue Ribbon, 
Childhelp USA and the House Ear Institute's Sonance group. 
</P>
<P>
Her home is another love. It's an English manor house, with leaded windows, 
huge beams, towering eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tending the Garden 
</P>
<P>
"I garden five or six hours a week," she says. She holds up her nails, 
unenameled, to reveal a tad of unscrubbed garden dirt, then points out Fred's 
home-grown tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The piano bench in the living room, where Fred practices his clarinet (he 
played in bands and orchestras in school), is covered with her needlepoint. Her 
paintings hang throughout their home. And her collection of Persian rugs, 
purchased on their many travels to Middle Eastern countries, grace the 
hallways. 
</P>
<P>
"But, I hate the kitchen," she grimaces. And at 111 pounds, svelte in pink silk 
pants, the blue-eyed blond proves food is not a passion. Instead, she and Fred 
play golf most weekends (she has a 29 handicap) at Los Angeles Country Club and 
alternately at Morningside at Rancho Mirage where they have a house. 
</P>
<P>
They're currently doing what lots of retired couples do: traveling, sizing up 
real estate, visiting chums with new beach houses. They plan a trip to Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria, and along the way will houseguest with 
Angelenos Dona and Dwight Kendall at Chantilly in France. Later they'll see the 
South Pole with USC trustees (Fred is on the board).

from James &amp; Williams Shoes, 5763 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 
90036, telephone (213) 938-3505; she usually orders by mail and says the item 
comes in one color only: beige. Our other source is also a mail-order firm. 
Sarane Van Dyke of Los Angeles, Helen Tomsky of Sun Valley, Margaret Beyer of 
Santa Ana, Corrine Brawley of Anaheim and Lila of San Diego all report that 
such hosiery can be obtained from National Wholesale Co. Inc., Lexington, N.C. 
27294, telephone (704) 249-0211. 
</P>
<P>
We now have two mail-order sources for Mrs. Henry of Huntington Park, who wants 
covers for four-slice toasters. Amy M. Meedel of Eagle Rock says catalogues put 
out by Spencer Gifts, 500 Packets Court, Williamsburg, Va. 23189, and 
Ambassador Gifts, P.O. Box 52146, Phoenix, Ariz. 85072-9825, carry the covers. 
Meedel adds that some K mart stores also have them.

HELP FOR ALZHEIMER'S CAREGIVERS

<P>
Shirlee Weissman held her purse tightly in her lap, looking at the faces 
gathered around her. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother usually doesn't know who I am," said Weissman, a 65-year-old widow 
living in North Hollywood. "When she looks into a mirror, she thinks she is a 
17-year-old girl. I dress her and feed her, and it's the same thing, day after 
day. It's like a vise tightening, and sometimes you feel like you'll go mad. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want them to die," she said, her voice dropping, "but sometimes you 
want them to die." 
</P>
<P>
For the group, which gathered recently at the Valley Senior Services and 
Resource Center in Reseda, the emotions were familiar. Weissman and her peers 
care for victims of Alzheimer's disease -- a progressive, irreversible brain 
disorder with no known cause or cure -- and they have all experienced the 
despair that comes with the job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Groups 
</P>
<P>
The Reseda center is one of a growing number of facilities in the San Fernando 
Valley that offer weekly support groups for the caregivers of people with 
Alzheimer's and other degenerative diseases. Although many are held in senior 
citizen centers or are hospital-affiliated, other groups meet in churches, 
temples and private homes. The most important need they fulfill is that of 
escape valve: sons and daughters, wives and husbands have an opportunity to 
spend some time without stress, some time to vocalize fears and desperation. 
</P>
<P>
If statistics on the number of people afflicted with the disease are any 
indication, the need for such groups is great. Three million Americans suffer 
from Alzheimer's disease, 25% of whom are older than 65, according to the 
Rockville, Md.-based American Health Assistance Foundation. Nearly 500,000 
Californians suffer from Alzheimer's disease, an estimated half of whom are 
cared for by relatives at home. The number of people suffering from the disease 
is expected to double in the next 50 years as the elderly population increases. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two ground rules," said Judy Wolfe of the groups she runs at 
the Reseda center. "One is that they are confidential, and the other is that 
there are no 'shoulds.' If you come in and say, 'Oh, well, that woman has it so 
much worse than I do, and I shouldn't feel so bad,' you deny your own feelings. 
Your problems are your problems," she said. In addition to providing 
information about the nature of the disease and how families can prepare 
themselves, the groups also give caregivers a chance to share daily 
difficulties with people who understand them firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
Topics at recent meetings have included the best way to bathe Alzheimer's 
patients, many of whom feel especially vulnerable and frightened at that time; 
dealing with transportation problems; handling financial and legal matters, and 
making time to renew and recharge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to know that other people have the same problems and then find out 
how they are dealing with them," said Beverly Bilford, whose husband, who 
suffers from Parkinson's disease and dementia, attends the Reseda center's 
adult day-care program twice a week. "Sometimes you just need a place where you 
don't have to say everything is fine," she said. (As part of the adult day-care 
program at the center, Bilford, like other caregivers, is required to attend 
the weekly support group meetings. Wolfe said attendance is mandatory because 
most people otherwise wouldn't ask for help.) 
</P>
<P>
Counselors point out that caregivers, many of them spouses or adult children of 
elderly parents, often are thrown onto an emotional roller coaster with little 
preparation for what lies ahead. Some of them are faced with caring for both 
elderly parents and young children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues Vary 
</P>
<P>
"They're all dealing with the same problem, but they each have different 
issues," said Kim Wilms, director of the Center for Alzheimer's Resource and 
Evaluation at Grenada Hills Community Hospital. (The center will provide the 
locations and telephone numbers of various support groups throughout the 
Valley, most of which are free.) Wilms also is a member of the support group 
subcommittee of the Alzheimer's Assn. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're caring for a parent and also have a family, it often causes friction 
in those relationships. You're also taking care of someone who used to take 
care of you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking care of a spouse, on the other hand, brings up different emotions. "It's 
someone you raised children with and made decisions with. And a lot of times, 
there are the additional burdens of taking on the things the spouse did," Wilms 
said. "Many women were brought up in a time when the husband did everything. 
They've never written a check." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many treatable diseases, time is not an ally for people with 
Alzheimer's. Patients often become depressed, irritable, restless and agitated, 
and their moods often become increasingly unpredictable. As their dementia and 
disorientation worsen, they become increasingly dependent on caregivers, 
leading many to report feeling trapped 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rage and Guilt 
</P>
<P>
"I've had them scream with rage at the situation, and then feel terrible guilt 
for having that emotion," Wolfe said. "I tell them that they have to take care 
of themselves and take time for themselves, or they'll break under the 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
(Last month a 60-year-old Highland Park woman fatally stabbed her 86-year-old 
mother, who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease. A neighbor and close 
friend told police that the daughter had become enraged over her mother's 
incontinence and the need to diaper her.) 
</P>
<P>
Counselors say the lack of predictability is one of the most difficult aspects 
of the disease. Just as a spouse or child may begin to adjust to the ominous 
realities of a loved one's illness, the person may appear to snap back to near 
normal. Then, just as hope is renewed, the patient's condition declines again. 
</P>
<P>
"On Saturday, he was beautiful. He talked to me, he knew me," Bilford said to 
the group in Reseda. "He told me he sees people, but he knows they're not 
really there. It's as if a little piece of awareness will come to him for brief 
moments, and that's what tears my heart out. I never know what man I will see." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letting Go 
</P>
<P>
For many caregivers, letting go can be the most difficult task of all. It is 
then, many have said, that the support of a group is needed most. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife's Alzheimer's started when she was only 58, but it went very rapidly," 
said Max Lipshultz, an air-conditioning consultant in Van Nuys who placed his 
wife of 41 years in a full-time nursing facility 20 months ago. In slightly 
more than two years, he said, what started with his wife confusing the names of 
neighbors progressed to "where I was about to drive both of us into the garage 
and leave the motor running." 
</P>
<P>
It was then, he said, that he began attending support group meetings at the 
Bernardi Multipurpose Senior Center in Van Nuys. Despite his willingness and 
desire to care for her himself, he said, the group helped him see that he was 
no longer in a position to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terribly difficult. I went through just a terrible time," Lipshultz 
said. "We were looking forward to enjoying our retirement together. We had our 
ups and downs," he said, "but we really were madly in love with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Lipshultz said he still attends the support group regularly to help others who 
may be facing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Time 
</P>
<P>
Although support groups help caregivers connect with others who are 
experiencing similar burdens, they also serve another function. In many cases, 
counselors say, caregivers must be encouraged to take time for themselves -- if 
only for brief periods of time. Adult day-care centers, offered at numerous 
facilities throughout the Valley, are an attempt to meet that need. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that as overwhelmed as many of them are, they also have difficulty 
letting go," Wolfe said. "They may think that no one can take care of them the 
way they can, and they may get some satisfaction from that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Lil Baker, whose husband has Parkinson's disease and diabetes in addition to 
Alzheimer's disease, sees it from a slightly different perspective. The 
soft-spoken, silver-haired woman said that caring for her husband at home is 
"terribly difficult" but that she wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the right thing to do," she said. "It makes me feel like a human being."

THE LATEST PARTY TREND? HOSTS WHO SAY 'NO' TO SERVING ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL KORNMAN, Kornman is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ellen Ben Basat of Tarzana, whose husband is an Israeli-born contractor, 
frequently entertains friends and business associates and has a fully stocked 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
But the bar at the Ben Basats always goes unused and the guests go home sober. 
</P>
<P>
The couple doesn't serve liquor at dinner parties because "we're not drinkers" 
and the guests, Ben Basat says, don't complain. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Basat serves seltzer, mineral waters and non-alcoholic fruit coolers when 
she entertains and says she likes being able to talk to guests without the 
distortion of intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to have a good laugh and remain clear-headed," she said. "I like being 
a guest at my own party." 
</P>
<P>
The Ben Basats, who have a 12-year-old daughter, Danielle, may provide an 
occasional glass of zinfandel or Japanese plum wine on request, but not very 
often "just because it's our way of life and a lot of people ask for water." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Way of Life 
</P>
<P>
Because of the continuing trend toward good nutrition and physical fitness, the 
dry dinner party has become a way of life for a growing number of families who 
have substituted bottled, sparkling and flavored waters for alcohol. 
Entertaining without alcohol is a trend in itself, these families say. 
</P>
<P>
Per-capita consumption of distilled spirits in the United States has been 
declining steadily in the 1980s, according to industry sources, and liquor 
sales have dropped dramatically, down 22% since 1980. Wine and beer consumption 
has peaked and is dropping, too, but not as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Strange of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which 
represents producers and marketers, said higher liquor taxes, more restrictions 
on the sale of liquor, concern about drunk drivers and the "so-called health 
and fitness trend that's taken the country" have sharply cut into the sale of 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"People are much more health- and fitness-minded," she said. So they're 
drinking less of all kinds of alcoholic beverages, including wine and beer. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Americans' taste for bottled waters of all kinds -- including 
some that resemble fruit-flavored soda pop -- is soaring, said Geary Campbell, 
a spokeswoman for the International Bottled Water Assn., a trade group 
representing dozens of domestic and foreign bottled-water producers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Up 500% 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said that since 1980, sales of bottled water have jumped 500%, with 
Evian, a non-sparkling imported French mineral water, leading the increasingly 
competitive pack. 
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, the sale of imported sparkling and non-sparkling waters jumped 
33.6%, due partly to the rate of consumption in California, which ranks as the 
largest consumer of bottled water in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Friedman and her husband Edward, an electrical contractor, have been 
married 36 years and they "next to never drink or serve alcohol" at dinner 
parties or luncheons in their home. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ruth Friedman says, she has never kept a store of liquor in her home 
and never served spirits as a matter of course. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, I started to serve crudites with apple cider or sparkling cranberry 
juice, which is harder to find," the Sepulveda resident said. "People tell me 
they appreciate not having to drink liquor." 
</P>
<P>
For a more elegant touch, she serves sparkling cranberry or apple juice in a 
champagne glass with a strawberry garnish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gift Bottles Returned 
</P>
<P>
If a guest does ask for an alcoholic drink, he will get a glass of zinfandel 
and "that's it." In fact, when the Friedmans are given liquor as gifts by 
business associates and others, they return the bottle with a note, asking the 
giver to make a donation instead to the Foundation for the Junior Blind in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After her son's recent bar mitzvah, Friedman entertained guests at a luncheon 
at their home. The traditional wine was served at the service, but the 
Friedmans did not toast with wine or whiskey at home. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, guests were offered sparkling waters mixed with fruit juice, 
fresh-fruit smoothies and malts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care for alcohol," Ruth Friedman said. "I don't appreciate it, I'm not 
familiar with it and I don't want to be responsible for any problems as far as 
my guests" are concerned. And "I prefer good nutrition." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Carlton does a lot of entertaining at her Westlake Village home, and the 
North Carolina-born wife and mother says she is a traditionalist. 
</P>
<P>
For guests, she sets a formal table, with fine china and crystal, 
bread-and-butter plates, individual silver salt and pepper servers, and a lace 
tablecloth. Fresh flowers -- often roses -- are a must. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner is never served buffet-style, and dessert is always served at the dining 
table, not in the living room or den. 
</P>
<P>
But dinner party tradition at the Carltons ends there -- they do not serve 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton, the 1988-89 Outstanding Junior of the Westlake Women's Club, says her 
family has always been health conscious but that she has noticed a trend away 
from hard liquor in home entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
The former program director of maternal health services for the San Fernando 
region of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, Carlton now 
does volunteer work and raises her two daughters, Janie, 9, and Jennifer, 7. 
Her husband, Dana, is a periodontist. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton says she has noticed a decline in the consumption of hard liquor at 
other homes in the last few years. "There was a time when more drinking was 
done," she said, but "not as many people want to drink mixed drinks" these 
days. "People are more knowledgeable about wine, about vineyards and years. 
They want good wine. And they're drinking less." 
</P>
<P>
There has never been an absolute ban on alcoholic drinks at the Carltons, but 
"the people we associate with seem to be doing less drinking in general," 
Carlton said. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a gradual trend, one I've noticed within the last year, 
first toward wine, then onto the next stage, to a variety of these waters. I 
keep them on hand for my family, too. . . . Our guests are relaxed when they 
walk through the door," she said. "They don't need alcohol to create that. I 
don't think it changes the tone of the dinner. With good company and good 
friends, it's certainly not a requirement." 
</P>
<P>
The couple does maintain a fully stocked bar, a longtime custom, just in case 
someone asks. 
</P>
<P>
"We would offer anyone anything they would want," she said. But "it's just very 
rare here today." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Rogers of Malibu teaches cooking classes at Let's Get Cooking in Westlake 
Village and at the Godmother in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informal Style 
</P>
<P>
Her home entertaining style is informal and much of the time excludes alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband Jeff, a real estate developer, prefer to serve cranberry 
juice mixed with sparkling water or Perrier and lime instead of wine or 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
By skipping the aperitif and the wine with dinner, "you can really taste the 
food, instead of intoxicating the palate. You would be amazed at the taste 
treat," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner parties at the Rogers home are not for adults only. "I like to have 
dinner parties with our friends who have kids our childrens' ages," she said. 
Ryan is 18 and Chad is 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially on holidays, we entertain with our friends and their children. We 
serve a lot of Pellegrino or Perrier and fresh grapefruit, orange or cranberry 
juice, mixed half and half, with club soda." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sunrise Effect' 
</P>
<P>
To make non-alcoholic drinks more attractive, she serves them in a tall glass, 
pouring the juice in first, half way up, then adding seltzer or club soda for a 
"sunrise effect." Lime is used as a garnish. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers also serves non-alcoholic "champagne cocktails" made without champagne, 
but served in champagne glasses. The base is sparkling apple juice, mixed with 
fresh raspberry puree or fresh peach puree. It looks elegant, she says, and 
"gives you this fabulous feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Laffey of Woodland Hills doesn't serve alcoholic drinks at her dinner 
parties, even though her husband may have a drink when they dine out. 
</P>
<P>
"Good old H2O on the rocks" is what she prefers. "It's very refreshing, and 
that's fine for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Laffey, a designer of hand-painted casual wear, and her husband Tom, a lawyer 
who heads the Century City office of Folger &amp; Levin, a San Francisco-based 
firm, frequently entertain at home, and most of their parties are alcohol-free. 
</P>
<P>
The Laffeys, who have two young children -- Samantha, 5, and Kelly, 2 -- keep 
most hard liquor on hand but "it hardly comes out because no one's interested." 
They also have wine and beer at home, but guests who are offered the option 
usually choose a non-alcoholic drink.

Tiny Bowlers 
</P>
<P>
We know that yuppies think they invented bowling, but the latest group to 
discover the sport is the age 3 to 7 crowd. "We don't keep numbers, but we've 
definitely seen a rise in these bowlers," says Cathy Wells, secretary of the 
San Fernando Valley chapter of the Young American Bowling Alliance. She also 
works at Panorama Bowl in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a boon to bowling," she says, calling them "the bowlers of the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Bowling alleys are able to compensate for the youngsters' lack of strength and 
aim by adding "bumpers" down the sides of the lanes. These are tubes of either 
inflatable rubber or cardboard or plastic piping. "They make it almost 
impossible for a kid to get a gutter ball," explains Mike Willis, manager at 
Canoga Park Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Most alleys are also equipped with lighter-weight balls with tinier finger 
holes. (And some alleys give discounts during the day.) 
</P>
<P>
Like adult enthusiasts, these junior bowlers join leagues. "The age range for a 
bumper-bowling league is 3 to 7," Willis says. "They have team names like The 
Nerds, Strike Force, Slammers, Cherry Bombers -- you get the idea." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Schwartz, 4, of Woodland Hills enjoys the sport, and his mom, Valarie, 
loves watching him play. "It takes forever for the ball to get to the pins, or 
sometimes it rolls all the way down there but stops dead right in front of 
them," she laughs, "but at least it doesn't go in the gutter." 
</P>
<P>
Rx for VCRs 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you've seen that American Express commercial where a youngster feeds 
his family's video cassette recorder a bowl of cereal. Parents of toddlers know 
all too well that a VCR is more fascinating than any toy to small, curious 
hands that fit so perfectly into the cassette slot. 
</P>
<P>
Some VCR repair shops in the Valley owe 10% to 20% of their business to 
toddlers who use the VCR as a dumping ground for whatever happens to be in 
their hands at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Keys and coins are the most common objects you'll find," reports Greg Larson 
of Sound Service Center in Canoga Park. "The most unusual thing I ever found 
was a big brass door handle. I'm still trying to figure out how the kid got it 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
Other items that frequently wind up inside the VCR are pens, pencils and 
crayons, notes Mildred Thomas, co-owner of Thomas Technologies in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We once found a Barbie doll head inside one," recalls Sonny Mun of Pleasure 
Electronics in Reseda. She suggests you buy a dust cover for your VCR and put 
it on when you're not using the machine. "We've also had kids throw up on the 
VCR's remote-control unit, doing damage to the board inside, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers aren't the only ones who do damage to VCRs. "We find pet hairs inside 
them all the time," Mun says. "We can always tell whether or not a customer has 
a cat or dog by the hair we find. And a lot of dogs chew up the remote 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Who says pets aren't good practice for babies? 
</P>
<P>
Big Cash 
</P>
<P>
If you paid more than $100,000 for your vehicle, you might be a little annoyed 
if it only lasted for seven years. Yet that's the average price and average 
life span of the city's garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Sanitation's East Valley district has received 11 new 
refuse-collection vehicles in the last four months -- worth more than $1 
million altogether. The trucks are not additions to its fleet of 125 trucks, 
but replacements for older, worn-out models. 
</P>
<P>
"The average payload for a truck is about 9 tons, and the drivers make one to 
two trips a day to the landfill. Because of all the starting and stopping, 
there's a lot of wear and tear on the hydraulic system, as well as on the 
engine," explains R.E. Cullors, who supervises the East Valley district from 
his Sun Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
The city buys about 104 replacement trucks a year. Older trucks are salvaged 
for parts. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to imagine how it could make your day to be given the keys to a 
spanking new $122,200 vehicle. "They're pretty happy about it," Cullors says, 
referring to his drivers, but adds, "All of our guys are proud of their 
trucks." 
</P>
<P>
Overdue Credit 
</P>
<P>
At least it happened in his lifetime. Nineteen years after landscape designer 
Koichi Kawana designed the Japanese Garden at the Donald C. Tillman Water 
Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys, a plaque with his name will finally be hung 
inside the front gate. 
</P>
<P>
The garden was a long time in coming to fruition. Kawana designed it in 1970, 
but funding problems delayed construction until the early 1980s. By then some 
of the technical specifications were outdated and had to be revised. It cost $3 
million to build and was opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want to do know why Dr. Kawana's name didn't make it onto the original 
dedication plaque," comments Gene Greene, senior landscape associate at the 
site. "But now that we're ready to cast a separate plaque in his honor, he'll 
finally get credit." (The original plaque looks like a directory listing of 
city politicians.) 
</P>
<P>
The 6 1/2-acre garden was Kawana's first endeavor. Since then he has designed 
gardens in half a dozen other states, in addition to working in the UCLA

To this day he is very involved in the garden's care. "You feel like it's your 
own baby. I go there about once a month or whenever they call me to check it 
out," he says, adding, "In Japan there are 300- to 500-year-old gardens. New 
gardens do not possess any importance in Japanese aesthetics. You have to be 
patient."

TEATRO SIN FRONTERAS;

<P>
SAN DIEGO REPERTORY THEATER PROGRAM CROSSES THE LINGUISTIC FRONTIER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Repertory Theatre lists its current production, Thin Air: Tales 
From a Revolution," as part of a new program, Teatro Sin Fronteras, meaning 
Theater Without Boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Rep also says that, although the name, Teatro Sin Fronteras, is new for it, 
the concept dates back to 1987 when it presented Luis Valdez's "I Don't Have to 
Show You No Stinkin' Badges," and continued last year with the bilingual 
"Burning Patience" and this year with the recently closed bilingual production 
of "Orinoco!" 
</P>
<P>
Why invent a name? What's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
In this case, it is a promise of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
Establishing a program called Teatro Sin Fronteras shows a commitment to Latino 
offerings as part of the Rep's annual schedule and strengthens the theater's 
track record, which should help fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the most significant episode in the continuing development of Latino 
theater in San Diego since the Old Globe founded Teatro Meta in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Teatro Meta presented San Diego's 
</P>
<P>
first bilingual production, "Fanlights." In 1986, the organization received a 
major Ford Foundation grant, expanding the scope of the Latino theater program. 
It established a school program, promoted the mainstreaming of Latino actors 
and found a play by Hispanic playwright Reuben Gonzalez called "The Boiler 
Room" that was presented as part of the Globe's regular season. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it is presenting a Latino Play Discovery Series that continues with 
"Latins Anonymous" Sept. 1-3 and 8-10, and concludes with "Death and the 
Blacksmith" by Uruguayan playwrights Mercedes Rein and Jorge Curi at the 
Progressive Stage Company space Oct. 27-29. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this activity the recent production of "Dangerous Games," the 
dance-theater piece by Argentine choreographer Graciela Daniele at the La Jolla 
Playhouse, and you have what appears to be a healthy Latino theater scene in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But the future is still uncertain: Audiences for bilingual shows at the Rep and 
Globe have been modest; the Globe's Ford Foundation grant is running out in 
October; and a three-year effort to establish a local Latino company remains a 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
There has been some progress. Opportunities for Latino stage actors have 
exploded since a young man named Raul Moncada used the pseudonym "Jeffrey 
Grimes" in order to get roles, and a teen-ager named William Virchis considered 
himself lucky to get cast as the singing, drinking Mexican, Pancho, in an early 
'60s Old Globe production of "Night of the Iguana." 
</P>
<P>
Virchis, now the head of the drama department at Southwestern University, 
described it as "ironic" that his first part in a play that dealt in some way 
with his heritage turned out to be only the most stereotypical of roles. But 
the part also led to a continuing friendship with the director, Craig Noel, now 
the executive producer at the Old Globe, who later worked with Virchis and 
Jorge Huerta on Teatro Meta as a way of expanding the opportunities for up and 
coming Latino actors. 
</P>
<P>
Noel said he not only wanted Teatro Meta to give Latinos something other to 
play than "sleepy Mexicans or Mexican maids," he also aimed to increase 
cultural understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show the hopes, the dreams, and the values in Hispanic plays were 
exactly the same, no matter which side of the border we live on," said Noel. 
</P>
<P>
Moncada, who succeeded the team of Virchis and Huerta as director of Teatro 
Meta, said the Old Globe was the first major regional theater with "a big Anglo 
history" to be funded by the Ford Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to see how tough a nut it was to crack," said Moncada. "And it 
cracked." 
</P>
<P>
But cracking theaters that want to be cracked is one thing. Could the theaters 
get the audience to support Latino theater once the grant money ran out? If 
they cooked dinner, would anyone come? 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Rep mulled over that very question when they began to work with 
Huerta, a professor at UC San Diego, on the bilingual production of "Burning 
Patience" and "Orinoco!" 
</P>
<P>
Huerta talked to the Rep about the millions of Mexicans just across the border 
who were hungry for good theater. He guessed -- roughly -- at what the 
Miami-based Strategy Research Corp., the largest company in the country doing 
research on Latinos, showed statistically this May. Latinos now number 473,800 
in San Diego county, or 17.7 of the total population. The burgeoning Latino 
population -- which has grown 72% in the past nine years -- will have $2.8 
billion in income to spend this year. In addition, Tijuana visitors will spend 
about $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
But if theaters have, in any way, a business consideration in doing such 
programming, it is a very long range decision. Even committed Latino directors 
like Huerta and Virchis concede that Latino audiences are not in the 
theatergoing habit and need to be wooed by the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The Rep's usual run for a show is six weeks, but it split the time span for a 
run between "Orinoco!" and "Thin Air," and targeted Mexican print and 
television journalists in Tijuana to sell the shows. The result for "Orinoco!" 
was 70-80% capacity audiences for six Spanish performances, respectable but not 
overwhelming for a house that only sits about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the theaters whose bread and butter are still the Anglo audience, 
fear that if they put too much time and energy into wooing Latinos, they may 
lose the base audience that keeps them afloat. Noel confesses that he still 
doesn't do as much Latino theater as he might like because there just isn't the 
audience to support it. As significant as Teatro Meta has been for Latino 
students and professionals, Noel's dreams for the program have far exceeded 
what it was able to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have a cultural exchange across the border, I wanted a festival, I 
wanted an educational program, new Latin plays and Mexican plays. Our futures 
depend on each other," Noel said, referring to Mexico. "Look at the terror that 
we live in in a little island off the coast of Florida called Cuba. And what 
will we do if Mexico becomes a Communist nation? We'll freak out. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do more than give a young attractive girl the opportunity to play 
Juliet. I wanted to move faster and have Panzer divisions all over. But the one 
campaign that the Ford Foundation was willing to fund was to audition and hire 
Hispanics. Noel said that, when the grant runs out, "I will probably be forced 
to narrow my sights because of economics. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think the climate has improved somewhat. I think all of a sudden there 
was a realization that our population was expanding to the extent that someday 
the Hispanics in California will not be a minority but a majority. But 
education and changing mores is a very very slow process. If I said, 'We're 
going to do nothing but Hispanic plays for one whole season,' we'd have to 
close our doors. You can only push people so far. You have to tease them and 
use sleight of hand to make them think that you're not pushing them but they're 
pushing you." 
</P>
<P>
Noel believes that Latino theater increases understanding between cultures 
where understanding is often sadly lacking. At the Rep, where the emphasis is 
on contemporary work, producing director Sam Woodhouse, who is directing "Thin 
Air," sees the inclusion of Latino theater as a necessary step to portraying 
the society we live in. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to suggest by Teatro Sin Fronteras is that a political 
border that once may have been relevant to us is no longer a relevant lie of 
demarcation between theaters," said Woodhouse. "It all comes back to 'Welcome 
to California in the late 20th century' when Anglos will be in the minority 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The commitment will be tested when the Old Globe's Teatro Meta grant runs out. 
And when the Rep finds out if it will or will not get funding. And when Latino 
plays fail. 
</P>
<P>
Just before "Orinoco!" opened, director Huerta was filled with anxiety that it 
might not do well and that people might use a negative response as an excuse 
not to do more bilingual theater. It's a fear that Virchis and Moncada 
understand all too well. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not given the chance to fail," said Moncada. "They're afraid that 
people will say, 'Oh well we got burnt once, we're not going to try it another 
time.' I've seen that happen in the Midwest. A show was not successful and they 
pulled out the entire Latino program. You have to increase production so you 
can afford to have failure. The more we do the more we'll be given a chance to 
fail. Otherwise it's too much pressure." 
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, all three directors are gambling that Latino theater in San 
Diego is here to stay. Huerta is administering the first bilingual MFA theater 
arts program in the country at UC San Diego. ("I would not have agreed to 
initiate this program if I thought I was preparing people for unemployment," he 
said). He's also hoping to continue his association with the Rep's Teatro Sin 
Fronteras. 
</P>
<P>
Virchis is still trying to raise money for Teatro San Diego, a Latino theater 
that he and Huerta tried to get off the ground three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Moncada just came back from a trip to Venezuela and Argentina, where he brought 
back over 105 plays, from which he plans to select candidates for the Latino 
Play Discovery Series. Virchis expressed doubt that the series will continue 
when the Ford money runs out, but ask Moncada if he believes it will, and his 
confidence in the program seems utterly unshaken. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe incredibly," said Moncada. "I don't see it as a fad because there is 
so much material out there. I travelled in several parts of South America and 
there is such a hunger, such a need to share information. The Latino 
playwrights in North and Latin America are just maturing as writers. Meanwhile, 
we're one of the few theaters involved in fostering Latino writing. You can't 
expect to start with a bang. I feel very good about the way the entire process 
is going in San Diego. We're breaking ground."

Yale University's British collection acquisition fund is expected to swell by 
some $100 million this fall following two auctions of works owned by art 
collector Paul Mellon. Christie's will handle the auction of 42 paintings and 
sculptures in New York on Nov. 14, and in London three days later. The 
collection includes works by Manet, Degas, Van Gogh and Picasso. Mellon, whose 
family fortune was made in banking, started collecting while studying at 
Cambridge University. He is now in his 80s. ALEENE MacMINN

A Garden Grove official who feels the city could replace subsidized 
performances by the Garden Grove Symphony with free concerts by military bands 
was the lone dissenter when the City Council voted 4-1 to allocate $16,000 for 
the orchestra's fifth annual free summer concert on Aug. 19. Council member 
Robert F. Dinsen also opposed an additional $14,000 for the symphony for the 
fiscal year that began July 1. The councilman, who opposes all municipal 
support for the arts, including the annual Grove Shakespeare Festival, 
complains that the Garden Grove Symphony's overhead has grown too high and says 
the orchestra is "overloaded with professionals." Military groups have played 
free concerts in the city twice in the last two years, but a spokesman for the 
U.S. Navy Band in San Diego says that military groups are limited to performing 
patriotic programs and prohibited from replacing an organization of 
professional musicians. Union and symphony officials say they are not opposed 
to anything that doesn't replace a paid performance. ALEENE MacMINN

A SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS W.A.S.P. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
W.A.S.P. made its local reputation in the early '80s by wearing codpieces and 
chain-sawing sides of beef on stage at the Troubadour -- the band was to heavy 
metal what Gallagher is to comedy. It made its international reputation with a 
very tasteful song called ". . . Like a Beast" and sold out vast arenas 
worldwide. Lead guitarist Chris Holmes was the guy you saw drowning himself in 
vodka in front of his mom in Penelope Spheeris' rockumentary "Decline of 
Western Civilization II." 
</P>
<P>
This year, less noisy than Poison and less evil than Slayer, outflanked by real 
speed-metal bands the way Playboy centerfolds were by Penthouse's, the 
W.A.S.P.-ers have kind of belatedly decided to become socially conscious, 
probably because they got sick of playing shows where Metallica shirts 
outnumbered theirs 10 to 1. They got Metal Church, a genuine, if dorky, 
political speed-metal band to doze through an opening set. They took a stand 
against the neutron bomb, only a dozen or so years after the Weirdos did. And 
if their on-stage denunciations of substance abuse are less than convincing, 
well . . . so are their riffs. 
</P>
<P>
W.A.S.P.'s stage set sort of resembles Peter Sellars' vision of hell in "Don 
Giovanni," with cardboard flames consuming sinners, a city and a giant death's 
head. And Tuesday W.A.S.P. was nothing but professional, leaping about at the 
half-empty Santa Monica Civic as if it were still headlining a packed Long 
Beach Arena. "Singer" Blackie Lawless growled OK, in a fluffier sort of way 
than he used to, and Holmes' solo on a cover of the chestnut "I Don't Need No 
Doctor" was almost as good as when Peter Frampton used to do it with Humble 
Pie.JONATHAN GOLD

STAGE WATCH : MIXED FEELINGS ON NEW LORT CONTRACT; SIMON CALLOW TO STAGE NEW 
MACHADO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strike by the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers against 67 
members of the League of Resident Theaters (LORT) was averted Tuesday when the 
society signed a new four-year contract with the league. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, LORT theaters include the Mark Taper Forum and South Coast Repertory 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
So is everybody happy? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but no. David Rosenak, the executive director of the society, stated in an 
official release Tuesday that the terms of the new contract "fall short of the 
union's stated goals." So why did its 25-member executive board vote to accept 
the league's final offer and recommend its approval to the 1,033 members? 
</P>
<P>
Absence of clout. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stephen J. Albert, managing director of the Taper, had the vote 
called for a strike, artistic and staff directors in resident theaters across 
the country (between 150 and 200 people) would have had to decide where their 
allegiance lay: to their union or their theaters. Many, he said, were prepared 
to exercise their court-sanctioned right of financial core status in their 
union (a right-to-work provision unions regard as deadly) in order to maintain 
their obligations to their boards of trustees. And the society knew this. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the reality," Rosenak said in New York. "We knew that all but one 
(artistic director), who was undecided, would have taken financial core (which 
exempts union members from strike discipline as long as they continue to pay 
dues and give up voting privileges and active participation). We're not pleased 
by that. I wish these directors had shown more solidarity so that we could have 
gotten a better deal. But we were in communication with our members around the 
country. They wanted a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply felt that any kind of a job action would not have gotten us a better 
deal at this time and that our members felt the same way. I do think, however, 
that while some of us here feel we may have lost this battle, we've increased 
the awareness of LORT in the plight of the individual director." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenak still believes that salaries don't constitute what he calls "a decent 
living wage." At a theater like the Taper, the top directing fee under the new 
contract will be $10,800 and the lowest $2,750. This can be spread over five 
weeks of rehearsal and five weeks of preproduction. 
</P>
<P>
"That pretty much limits work to a maximum of five plays per year," Rosenak 
said. "We found out that average earnings came to about $30,000 a year for the 
most active directors in LORT. That's what we'd like to change. It obviously 
will take us more time." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that an article in the Aug. 7 U.S. News and World Report places 
the salaries of directors of prominent cultural institutions at close to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't begrudge arts administrators their salaries," he said. "All we're 
saying is that if there's a commitment to the institutions, there must also be 
one to the artists working in those institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson, considered a high earner, agreed about 
the commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a difficult period," he said in a phone call from London. "I was 
fearful it would hurt or break the union because artistic and associate 
directors would have had to resign and take financial core participation. I'm 
glad we didn't have to. There's great concern about free-lance directors. I 
pledge myself and I think other artistic directors pledge themselves, during 
these four years, to work hard to have the union better understand the role of 
artistic directors and all work together to help the funding situation so that 
artists can get a better wage -- not only directors, but everyone on the 
creative side, all of whom are underpaid." 
</P>
<P>
A date for a membership ratification vote has not been set. "When we took the 
vote eight weeks ago (a rejection of an earlier proposal)," Rosenak explained, 
"we did something new. We took it for the first time at locations outside New 
York City. It's a rather complicated procedure. We'll have to set up meetings 
in eight cities." 
</P>
<P>
The new contract is retroactive to April 15, 1989, and goes to April 14, 1993. 
Except for some percentage increases, details of the new agreement were not 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
WIN ONE, LOSE ONE: Enter Simon. Exit Eimuntas. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Callow ("Jacques and His Master") is coming back to the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center early next year to stage a new play that Eduardo Machado ("A 
Burning Beach") is still writing. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Machado doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
His new piece, "Stevie Wants to Play the Blues," is being written for three 
actresses: Amy Madigan, Jonelle Allen and Deirdre O'Connell. It is "inspired" 
by the story of Billy Tipton, the jazz musician who died in Seattle last year 
and was posthumously discovered to have been a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to write about how people take on roles, play the roles that society 
dictates," Machado said from New York. Another "M. Butterfly" gender-bender? 
</P>
<P>
" 'M. Butterfly' is about someone finding their sexuality," Machado said. "This 
is about someone denying their sexuality. And about the people who are talented 
but not exceptional and can't find a niche. It's also about black people and 
white people -- differences in color, in sex. And about the parent in yourself: 
your own self-image, about how you should be. It's a real process. Interesting 
to write a play that's going to be done. A first for me. A lot of pressure, but 
exciting, too. I'm in the middle of the second act, so I can't tell you how it 
ends." 
</P>
<P>
We'll wait. London designer Bruno Santini will design the show. Rehearsals 
start Jan. 2, previews Feb. 3 and the show opens Feb. 17. 
</P>

As for the elusive Lithuanian Eimuntas Nekrosius, who was invited to direct 
first "Ivanov" then "The Cherry Orchard" in the summer or fall of 1990, his 
arrival at LATC has been postponed indefinitely. He's deep into a highly 
personal staging of "King Lear" in his home town of Vilnius that may take him 
months more to complete. It is expected to eventually travel to Chicago. And 
Los Angeles? Stay tuned.

AUDIENCE IN EARTHA'S ORBIT AT THE CINEGRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The name, with its sensual resonances, still fits, even after all these years. 
Eartha Kitt: the suggestion of deep primal energies connected to a playful 
feline association. The perfect appellation for a performer whose almost 
shamanistic earthiness is energized with flashes of cat-like high voltage. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the Southland for the first time in two years, Kitt's 
opening-night performance at the Cinegrill Tuesday night was a classic 
presentation of the original Cat Woman on the prowl. Looking almost as lithe 
and supple as she did in her early years as a dancer, Kitt stalked around the 
tiny stage restlessly, pausing occasionally to capture a member of the audience 
with a penetrating gaze, then moving on with a hearty, growling burst of 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
She sang many of her big songs from the '50s: "C'est Si Bon," "I Wanna Be 
Evil," "An Old-Fashioned Girl." Each typified her enormously successful 
characterization of a worldly wise woman who knew the value of a dollar -- and 
then some. 
</P>
<P>
But her best work took place on other numbers -- especially the medleys of 
"Guess Who I Saw Today"/"Could I Leave You?" and "The Blues"/"St. Louis Blues" 
-- in which she displayed her rich skills as a chanteuse in the archetypal 
French style. Like Edith Piaf, Kitt is a superb actress and storyteller. Her 
dramatic sense of timing -- with an occasional pause in the rhythm and a 
penetrating flash of her eyes -- even made songs like "I'm Still Here" and "I 
Will Survive" something more than bitter reminiscences of past glories. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Eartha Kitt is doing a lot more than surviving. Far from the one-note 
characterization that first made her reputation, she now is a consummate 
cabaret performer, one of the best in the world. Her two-week engagement is a 
must-attend for anyone who cares to experience the glory of a mature and 
exhilarating artist at the peak of her skills. 
</P>
<P>
Kitt continues at the Cinegrill tonight through Saturday and Tuesday through 
next Thursday.DON HECKMAN

DAVID ZINMAN CONDUCTS PHILHARMONIC AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back after a week's vacation, the Los Angeles Philharmonic sounded suitably 
refreshed Tuesday at Hollywood Bowl. David Zinman, music director of the 
Baltimore Symphony, led the orchestra in an evening of comfortable 
music-making. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar rites of Dvorak's Symphony No. 9, "From the New World," were not 
so much rethought as thoroughly dusted and polished. Working from memory and 
without a baton, Zinman encouraged a balanced, well-blended sound in service of 
an unexaggerated though supremely articulate interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
All that was lacking was a final measure of passion, to give this pointed 
reading immediacy across the Bowl expanse. It was all very agreeable, but not 
terribly urgent. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic played for Zinman with limber, equable grace. Carolyn Hove 
spun out the English horn theme of the Largo as an elusive, soulful mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Leonard, Philharmonic principal cellist, was the featured soloist for 
the occasion. He could not supply the sense of purposeful direction and shape 
that Lalo left out of his diffuse Concerto in D minor, but he did ennoble the 
rhetoric with sweet, focused sound and flew blithely over the technical 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Zinman and the orchestra backed Leonard with becoming and understandable 
modesty, given the musical throat-clearing and murmurs of the accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began, post National Anthem, with John Harbison's "Remembering 
Gatsby." Zinman and the Philharmonic treated it with seductive affection, 
finding the poignancy in this bit of fractured neo-Romantic nostalgia. 
</P>

THE BUTCHER: THE KEY TO BETTER FOOD LABELING -- KEEP IT SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is ever increasing evidence linking diet and health. We are, it seems 
very clearly, what we eat. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration, in an attempt to make it easier for consumers 
to keep something of a handle on what they are eating, is preparing to require 
major changes in nutrition information on labels of packaged foods. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to say to consumers you can modify your diet and change your 
health, there needs to be a label that can be used," said Dr. Frank Young, the 
FDA commissioner. "I believe the time has come for food labeling reform." 
</P>
<P>
I could not agree more. Food labeling in this country is confusing, 
contradictory and out of control. Something should be done. There ought to be a 
law. Maybe the new regulations proposed by the FDA will help. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that regulators will look at five areas in which food labels can be 
made more useful and understandable for consumers. Those areas are nutrition 
labeling, ingredient labeling, label format, food description and health 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
By September, the FDA hopes to announce a schedule for hearings to discuss 
proposed changes. The earliest any new labeling rules would take effect is in 
1991, so there is time enough for all of us to give some thought and help the 
FDA come up with something logical in food labeling. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I have thought about this a great deal throughout the years, and I 
would like to propose that the new labeling laws for all food products be kept 
as simple and accurate as possible. In my opinion, simple basic logic seems 
often to elude lawmakers. That's the main reason today's food labeling is, in a 
word, crazy. 
</P>
<P>
One important change that I think would help: It should be illegal to list on 
the label of any product any ingredient, animal, vegetable, mineral, chemical 
or nutritional, that is not in the product. That's very simple, isn't it? And 
very logical. It would be totally illogical, indeed impossible, to list on any 
label all of the ingredients that are not in a product -- no label in the world 
is that big. 
</P>
<P>
It should therefore, I think, be mandatory that a company list on the label of 
any product only those ingredients that are in the product. To do otherwise is, 
if not dishonest, at least intentionally misleading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questioning Labels 
</P>
<P>
At a recent food show, I was struck by the number of products that were 
prominently labeled "No Cholesterol." Everything from pasta products to fruit 
preserves, from gourmet jelly beans to pinto beans were boldly labeled "No 
Cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
It finally got to me and I had to confront the situation. "Why do you have 
these beans labeled with a sticker that says they have 'No Cholesterol'?" I 
asked one bean peddler. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they contain no cholesterol," she replied, looking at me with eyebrows 
raised as if I had just asked the stupidest question. 
</P>
<P>
"But, I don't think any beans have cholesterol, do they?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," the bean peddler replied. "All I know is these beans don't have 
and we think people should know that." 
</P>
<P>
"How about sodium and saturated fat? People are concerned about those things 
too. Are any of those things in these beans?" I asked. "And arsenic. Is there 
any arsenic in your beans, or cyanide. If there are none of those awful things 
in your beans, don't you think people should know? Don't you think you should 
list those on your label too? 'No Cholesterol, No Arsenic, No Cyanide, No. . . 
.' 
</P>
<P>
"Are you trying to make trouble?" the bean peddler interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"No ma'am," I said, "I'm only trying to make sense."

SATISFYING SALADS ARE PERFECT MAIN-DISH MEALS IN THE HEAT OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More and more people are discovering satisfying salads that play main-dish 
roles in their meals. Due to a wider selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, 
produce consumption has increased a great deal. Other than meats, poultry or 
seafood, good sources of protein such as beans, rice, pasta, eggs or cheese may 
be combined with the fresh fruits or vegetables.

Refreshing salads of varied flavors and textures become even more appreciated

MICROWAVE: HANDLE TOMATOES WITH KID GLOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tomatoes aren't something most of us would dream of microwaving. Yet they 
microwave just fine if given kid-glove care. 
</P>
<P>
If you intend to microwave fresh tomato halves, be sure to choose those that 
are of medium size (about six ounces apiece) and are firm-ripe. Juicier 
tomatoes will simply disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's no point in microwaving tasteless tomatoes, the kind that 
are bred more for firmness than flavor then picked green, packaged in plastic 
and shipped cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
The tomatoes to microwave are those from your own garden or from the nearest 
farmer's market. Home-grown tomatoes are coming into season, and here are just 
a few ways to microwave them with perfect results. 
</P>
<P>
BEEFSTEAK TOMATOES AU GRATIN 
</P>
<P>
4 (about 6-ounce) firm-ripe beefsteak tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
8 (1/8-inch) slices sharp Cheddar, Swiss or Gruyere cheese 
</P>
<P>
Halve tomatoes crosswise, but do not peel. Arrange tomato halves in circle on 
microwave-safe 12-inch platter, cut-sides up and not touching. 
</P>
<P>
Cover with plastic wrap, vented at 1 corner, and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 
5 to 6 minutes, rotating platter 180 degrees at half time, until tomatoes are 
slightly softened. 
</P>
<P>
Cut cheese slices slightly smaller than tomato halves. Top each tomato half 
with 1 cheese slice and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 1 1/2 
to 2 minutes until cheese melts. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
STEWED TOMATOES 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds medium, firm-ripe tomatoes, peeled, cored and quartered 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons grated onion 
</P>
<P>
1 large clove garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup minced sweet red pepper or celery 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon minced fresh basil or oregano or 1/4 teaspoon crushed dried 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon celery salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Mix tomatoes, onion, garlic, sweet red pepper, basil and sugar in 
microwave-safe 2-quart casserole. Add bay leaf. 
</P>
<P>
Cover with tight-fitting lid (wax paper between dish and lid works well) and 
microwave on HIGH (100% power) 3 to 6 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes, until 
just soft. (Don't overcook. Time will vary according to variety and ripeness of 
tomatoes, so check often.) 
</P>
<P>
Discard bay leaf, sprinkle tomatoes with celery salt and pepper and serve warm, 
at room temperature, or chilled. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
RICE AND CHEDDAR-STUFFED TOMATOES 
</P>
<P>
4 (2 1/2- to 3-inch diameter) firm-ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1 small onion, peeled and minced 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cooked rice 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons minced canned green chiles 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt, about 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Slice 1/4 inch off stem ends of tomatoes and discard. Scoop seeds and pulp into 
bowl, drain tomatoes upside-down on several thicknesses of paper towel. Discard 
tomato seeds, drain pulp and coarsely chop. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave onion and butter in wax-paper-covered microwave-safe, 1-quart 
casserole, on HIGH (100% power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until transparent. Mix in 
tomato pulp, rice, cheese, chiles, salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Stuff tomatoes with rice mixture, dividing evenly. Arrange tomatoes in 9-inch 
pie plate, 1 inch apart, leaving empty space in center. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 7 to 9 minutes, rotating pie 
plate 180 degrees at half time, until tomatoes are just soft. Check for 
doneness after 7 minutes (don't pierce or tomatoes will lose juice and shape). 
Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Because tomatoes microwave fast, cooked stuffings that only require 
reheating work best. In microwave ovens of 700 watts or more, vine-ripened 
tomatoes may cook more evenly on MEDIUM (50% power), but time may need to be 
increased 1 to 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

I miss my trash compactor. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, had it not been built into the house we moved from, this electric 
appliance would never have made it on my wish list. 
</P>
<P>
It's been almost eight months since this family of four have tried living 
without the trash machine. (My little boy used to call it the "monster 
stamper.") The test, which seemed more like a sacrifice, is over. The need to 
get a new one has to be fulfilled, to condense each week's peaking heap of 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
In trash compactor days, life was easier when the garbage handling task was 
done about just once a week, or more when people came over. I don't miss the 
"monster" for the emptying chore when the bag seemed to weigh tons, but the 
majority of the time, that heavy load was handled by the stronger member of the 
family. Miscellaneous trash (which doesn't take long to pile up in most 
households these days) didn't clutter kitchen countertops or the rest of the 
house. Junk mail, dirty wrappers and paper towels, bulky cans, milk cartons and 
bottles -- all got dumped and crushed, day in and day out. There was no arguing 
about having to empty the trash bin under the sink as soon as it was full, 
which now averages at least once a day. 
</P>
<P>
"You're crazy to put one in, now that people are ripping them out in their 
kitchen remodeling," a decorator friend advised after we moved in to this other 
house, "the smells can get prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanitary Habits 
</P>
<P>
But for a family of four that averages 13 gallons of trash a week, the electric 
compactor is still the most sensible and ecologically beneficial way to go, 
according to kitchen consultants. "The garbage men will love you," one of them 
commented. The great kill-joy -- unpleasant odors, everyone agreed -- can be 
easily avoided if simple sanitation habits are formed. 
</P>
<P>
"If garbage (or wet trash that belongs in the disposer) happens to be thrown 
into the compactor, it will rot in seven or eight days and naturally smell," 
said Stewart Fair, kitchen design consultant and owner of Kitchens by Stewart 
in Pasadena. "It usually takes a family of two two weeks to fill the compactor 
bin, so they have to be careful not to throw garbage in it. Otherwise the 
basket needs to be taken out and cleaned thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
Choosing a trash compactor model is not a difficult matter, as most trash 
compactors work in the same uncomplicated manner, offering similar advantages. 
The toe pedal, for instance, is now offered by newer designs. This helps open 
the drawer when hands are full. Another is a deodorizer compartment for odor 
control; also now, the new drawers slide out for cleaning accessibility. Space 
availability is a popular determining factor; new models have slimmed down yet 
offer great force. Safety is another consideration. Locks are common. "The lock 
prevents a kid from putting a cat or dog inside that bin to see what happens," 
one salesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Cabinet Space 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't have the luxury of extra cabinet space in the kitchen, the 
compact or narrower designs, built in or free-standing, would be a good choice. 
One of them is the Broan Trash Compactor, Model 1050, a 12-inch wide unit that 
is just as powerful, if not more powerful, than some larger units. This trimmed 
model features a patented "double scissors" ram and motor design, which 
transmits a compacting force of 5,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
I like its convenient bag storage with a flip-down door, located just below the 
top surface. An optional solid hardwood cutting board may be ordered for 
free-standing units. Another design element in the Broan model that eliminates 
needless lifting of the bag caddy and full trash bag is the way the door swings 
away to release the entire drawer. 
</P>
<P>
The Broan compactor comes with interchangeable door panels with two reversible 
panels (in white) that enable you to select any of four colors: almond, 
harvest, black and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The built-in 15-inch KitchenAid Trash Compactor is powered by a one-third 
horsepower motor that delivers 2,300 pounds of force to crush trash in 
approximately 27 seconds. To minimize odors, KitchenAid provides an activated 
charcoal air filter and odor control fan with on-and-off switch. The unit is 
also designed with a toe bar opener that allows the drawer to glide smoothly, 
plus an interchangeable front panel pack in almond, white, black and harvest 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
A 3,000-pound compacting force to crush trash in 35 seconds maximum is achieved 
by KitchenAid's top of the line built-in or free-standing 18-inch model. An 
upper litter bin lets you load small items while the compactor is operating. 
The trash drawer is larger and the unit includes a storage bag compartment. 
</P>
<P>
Another compact compactor comes from Thermador/Waste King in a 12-inch built-in 
or free standing model. Thermador is the only manufacturer that has a stainless 
steel line. Their compactor has a ram that's designed to exert approximately 
3,000 pounds of pressure. The unit is also equipped with a custom-controlled 
deodorizer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pioneers in the trash compacting field is Whirlpool. One of its 
newer models has a quiet pack sound conditioning feature. The units exert 2,300 
pounds of ram force to compact trash to about 1/4 of its original volume. Other 
features include easy drawer glide by touch-toe pedal, reusable bag caddy, 
automatic anti-jam and solid air freshener compartment. The interchangeable 
panels come in black and almond, or black and white. 
</P>
<P>
The GE Monogram Compactor is not just narrow (12 inches), but offers design 
flexibility for custom kitchens. In addition to black or white reversible 
control panel, the compactor drawer also accepts custom paneling to blend with 
whatever cabinets you have. Like other models, the Monogram offers safety 
key-locking and door latch features, bag storage area and air freshener cavity. 
</P>
<P>
 The trash compactors are available at A-1 Appliances, Long Beach, Snyder 
Diamond and most appliance dealers and kitchen cabinet shops in Southern 
California. Depending on size, compactors range in price from about $289 to 
$529.

FILLMORE HOPES TO PERSUADE EGG RANCHS TO CURB ODORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET BERGAMO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the ongoing saga of the smell that devoured Fillmore, city officials have 
decided to consult a University of California poultry specialist for advice on 
minimizing the odors from 4 million chickens at two egg ranches 10 miles south 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have complained that the smell, which permeates Fillmore from time to 
time each summer, has been particularly bad this year, and city officials have 
looked to the egg ranches for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
"They finally admitted that chicken manure smells," said Fillmore City Manager 
Roy Payne, referring to a meeting of egg ranchers and city officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said wind and weather conditions, particularly offshore breezes that seep 
over the egg operations, also contribute to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the preliminary discussion, Donald Bell, a poultry specialist 
from UC Riverside, has been asked to visit the two ranches -- Egg City and Eggs 
West -- to review manure-handling practices. 
</P>
<P>
Another meeting with county officials, egg ranch personnel, and Fillmore 
administrators is tentatively scheduled for early September to discuss Bell's 
analysis and consider further action. 
</P>
<P>
But what that action might be remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say the Air Pollution Control District has no jurisdiction 
over agricultural odors. Fillmore's choices are thus limited to encouraging 
voluntary action on the part of the ranchers, or pursuing expensive legal 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs West is planning a changeover to a more modern method of manure treatment, 
according to City Manager Payne. Egg City owner Rick Carrott said his operation 
has been using the method for years and is considered a model in the egg ranch 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
As a poultry specialist, UC's Bell is no stranger to disputes between farmers 
and city dwellers. Sometimes the issue is flies, at other times odor, Bell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have animals and people together, we'll have problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that he will not assume a policing role, but will examine 
practices at the two ranches to spot weaknesses that the egg operations could 
choose to correct voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said he sees the egg-ranch conflict as part of a trend that may eventually 
force animal-based agriculture out of California altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"California gets 2,000 new people a day," Bell said. "That's the real problem. 
Animal-based farming can't be in suburbia." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of an aerial reconnaissance flight taken by Fillmore officials in 
late July, Mayor Delores Day said she attended last Thursday's meeting 
confident that the egg ranches are indeed the source of the odor. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the session, the city suggested several procedures, believing 
them to be inexpensive for the ranches to implement. According to Day, these 
included hauling manure away more often, spreading it more thinly and 
composting the material only when fully dry. 
</P>
<P>
"We assured them we were seeking an amicable solution, not trying to put them 
out of business," Day added. 
</P>
<P>
Egg City's Rick Carrott expressed discomfort nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be important to the community," he said. "Now the demographics are 
changing -- they want to get rid of us." 
</P>
<P>
The larger of Moorpark's two egg producers, Egg City, employs 480 residents of 
Fillmore, Moorpark, Santa Paula and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Carrott admitted that chicken manure stinks. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife makes me take my shoes off before I come in the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he expressed concern that his ranch will be pressured into taking measures 
it cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are the problem, we can try to do what they are suggesting, but it may 
not always be possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrott said he is still hopeful of one day achieving an odor-free operation, 
and of being a good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things are possible -- but, then, I used to believe in the tooth 
fairy, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions that the odor might be caused by Fillmore's sewer plant, a source 
of some terrible smells of its own during a renovation 10 years ago, were 
refuted by Wastewater Supt. Kelly M. Polk of the Ventura Regional Sanitation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"There has not been any upset of the treatment plant to warrant an odor 
problem," Polk said. He added that Fillmore's facility, which is owned by the 
city and run by Regional Sanitation, "is very stable -- one of the better 
ones."

FOR NAVY FAMILIES, IT'S A HARDSHIP POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas R. McClelland has a wife and three children, but he cannot afford to 
live with them. 
</P>
<P>
McClelland, a Navy lithographer stationed at the Pacific Missile Test Center at 
Point Mugu, visits them in San Diego on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been living in the barracks here since I was transferred from San Diego 
in November," McClelland said. "I travel back to San Diego on Friday night and 
get up Monday at 3 a.m. so I can be back here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rough on me, no doubt about it," McClelland said. "It's rough on my car 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Seaman Apprentice Joy Anita Reid, 21, joined the Navy a year ago and lives with 
her 3-month-old baby in a one-bedroom apartment in Port Hueneme. Reid's sister, 
who takes care of the baby during the day, shares the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Welfare Program 
</P>
<P>
Reid's take-home pay is about $960 a month. Her rent is $585 monthly. She has 
applied to a state welfare program for free cheese and milk and is thinking 
about signing up for food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of living is so high here," she sighed. "But it's easier for me than 
some other people because I'm a Christian. God takes care of me." 
</P>
<P>
McClelland and Reid are two of thousands of military personnel at Point Mugu 
and the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme trying to adjust to 
the harsh realities of the Ventura County housing market. 
</P>
<P>
While Navy officials at the two installations are concerned about the recent 
loss of top civilian scientists and engineers who quit to buy houses elsewhere, 
the Navy also faces increasing problems in finding decent rental housing for 
enlisted personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 8,000 military personnel at the two Navy installations, about 5,500 live 
off-base. The Navy warns personnel that it may be best to leave their families 
behind when moving to Ventura County until housing can be secured, but most 
bring their wives and children and hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
The typical tour of duty at both Point Mugu and Port Hueneme is three years, 
and it can take up to two years for a family to get the limited military 
housing available. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, they are on their own when it comes to finding an apartment 
in the surrounding communities of Port Hueneme, Oxnard and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Navy personnel, Colleen Griffith, an aviation maintenance 
administrator, had to get financial help from her parents to cover the rent and 
security deposit on her apartment when she was transferred to Point Mugu 18 
months ago from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith, 32, a single parent with a 4 1/2-year-old son, had been paying $525 
for a two-bedroom apartment in San Diego. After her transfer she moved first 
into a one-bedroom apartment in Oxnard for $600 a month and now pays $650 
monthly toward the rent of a Port Hueneme townhouse that she shares with one of 
Point Mugu's civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on a waiting list for base housing for 14 months and then decided to 
forget it," said Griffith, who has been in the Navy nine years. "The rents are 
higher here than almost any place in the country, but the toughest part is 
getting the money together to move in. Landlords want about $2,000 for most 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"I know people who commute very long distances because of the housing here," 
Griffith added. "My hope is that I'll be going back to San Diego after my tour 
here. Housing is one of the reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrowed Money 
</P>
<P>
Many turn to Navy Relief for help in raising the money necessary to move into 
off-base housing, among them John Sawyers, 26, a photographer's mate who 
borrowed $550 to move into a two-bedroom Port Hueneme apartment with his wife 
and two children when he arrived at Point Mugu two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a lot of money for me," Sawyers said. "But we were lucky. We found an 
ex-Navy guy who gave us a break on the rent. Two-bedrooms usually go for a lot 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Sawyers waited almost two years before his name came up on a list for a 
three-bedroom house at the missile center itself, and he considers himself 
fortunate to have a back yard and adequate space for his family. 
</P>
<P>
"It's helped out a lot," he said. "But most of the people here never make it 
into the base housing." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to high rents, Navy families often wind up in substandard housing 
because of the general shortage of apartments in towns surrounding the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Mathews, another Navy photographer, was living with her two sons in a 
two-bedroom south Oxnard apartment before recently getting for one of the 315 
Navy-owned townhouses in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a real good area at all," she said. "The apartment wasn't very plush 
either. There were no drawers for silverware in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
According to Navy officials, the housing situation has dramatically worsened in 
the last few years. Senior Navy personnel at Point Mugu recall when there was 
relatively little difficulty finding good housing in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Condo 
</P>
<P>
"I was actually able to buy a condo in north Oxnard when I moved here five 
years ago," said Aviation Machinist Mate John Wallis, 42. "I paid $89,400. The 
only reason I did it was I was able to go VA, with no down payment." 
</P>
<P>
Wallis, who will retire from the Navy next year, recently moved into the 
bachelor's quarters at Point Mugu, sending his wife and two children to 
Waynesville, Mo., to wait for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to sell the condo here for $190,000 and I found a place back there 
on 10 acres that was going for $95,000," he explained. "I could have never 
found something like that here, and it was too good a deal to pass up." 
</P>
<P>
With the separation from his family, the next year will be a long one, Wallis 
said. But he added that he considers himself lucky in comparison to younger 
enlisted personnel entering the local housing market too late to qualify as a 
home buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for them," Wallis said. "I couldn't afford to have bought my 
condo if I'd been transferred here today. It's hard to find anything 
affordable. These young kids put half their pay and more into an apartment, and 
they don't have much left to live on. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make for an easy life," he said.

LONG BEACH BACKS MOVE TO BAR BIAS OVER AIDS

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With little ado, the City Council this week endorsed a proposal outlawing 
discrimination against people who have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote that drew applause from a crowd of supporters, the council 
ordered preparation of an ordinance that would prohibit discrimination in 
housing, on the job, or in offering business or medical services. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it wasn't controversial. Something like this shouldn't be 
controversial," said David Newell, who, as president of the Long Beach Lambda 
Democratic Club, has been one of the proposal's leading proponents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smith Urged Support of Measure 
</P>
<P>
Six California cities, including Los Angeles and Pasadena, already have AIDS 
anti-discrimination on the books, as do six counties, including Los Angeles. 
"We feel the city of Long Beach should join other cities," Councilman Clarence 
Smith said in urging his colleagues' support. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, those who believe they are being discriminated 
against because they have AIDS or are simply perceived to have AIDS could file 
a civil lawsuit, both for damages and to halt the discrimination. The city 
attorney would also have the authority to sue to stop instances of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates, who faced virtually no opposition at Tuesday's council meeting, 
argued that the legislation is necessary both to protect civil rights and to 
create an environment in which people will undergo testing for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome without fear of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
"We must work to reduce the risk," said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who 
introduced the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 600 reported cases of AIDS, Long Beach has one of the most 
serious AIDS problems in Los Angeles County. City health officials have 
endorsed the ordinance, stressing that there is no medical reason to 
discriminate against those with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memo on Transmission of AIDS 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that the virus is transmitted in the air, by sneezing, by 
shaking hands, by sharing a glass, by insect bites, by living in the same 
household with an AIDS sufferer or by any other incidental or casual contact," 
Diana M. Bonta, the city's director of Health and Human Services, wrote in a 
memo to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the virus that causes AIDS is transmitted through sexual contact and 
through exposure to infected blood, or from an infected mother to her baby at 
the time of birth. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first cities in the nation to enact an AIDS anti-discrimination 
ordinance, Los Angeles assigned a deputy city attorney to handle complaints 
filed under the 1985 law. The city has received about 300 complaints during the 
four years the law has been in effect, but has never gone to court, said David 
Schulman, the Los Angeles city attorney who oversees the AIDS cases. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying earlier at a council committee meeting on the matter, Schulman said 
there are several reasons why the complaints have not wound up in court. Many 
of them are settled, AIDS victims do not want publicity about their condition 
and they are often too ill to pursue a lengthy court case. 
</P>
<P>
Mark S. Senak, an attorney who has handled a number of AIDS discrimination 
complaints around the country, said that it is his experience that if people 
lose their jobs because they have AIDS they are more likely to settle for 
financial damages and continued insurance benefits than reinstatement. "People 
tend not to take their job back or want it back," said Senak, who is now 
working as the AIDS Project director at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach.

The Cudahy Redevelopment Agency on Monday approved an out-of-court settlement 
with the financially troubled Cudahy Social Service Agency for $40,000 in back 
rent that it expects to raise from the proceeds of a bingo game. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Redevelopment Agency must receive the money by June, 
30, 1990, or the Social Service Agency, which distributes food and clothing to 
the needy, must move out. 
</P>
<P>
The city cut off funding for the Social Service Agency last September and has 
tried since November to evict it from its offices at Elizabeth Street and Otis 
Avenue. The agency has paid no rent to the city since July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, voted 3 to 1 to approve 
the agreement. One member, Councilman John Robertson, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The lone dissenter, Councilman Joe Fregeau, said: "The whole thing sounds 
fishy." He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph D. Castagno, attorney for the Social Service Agency, said its executive 
director, James L. Graham, is expected to sign the agreement by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement relies on Graham's ability to raise the $40,000 from a bingo game 
that would be operated by the nonprofit Cudahy Social Service Foundation, 
recently formed by John Mgrdichian, a Compton businessman and casino operator. 
</P>
<P>
Mgrdichian owns Murcole, a Compton rubbish firm, and the Hi Desert Casino &amp; 
Inn in Adelanto, near Victorville. He also has an interest in the California 
Commerce Club, a card club in the city of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy is reviewing Mgrdichian's application for a license to run a 450-seat 
bingo parlor that would be built at 4610 Santa Ana St., on property recently 
purchased by the Cudahy Social Service Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Mgrdichian would not predict how much money could be made in such a venture but 
said he intends to donate funds to local social service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
According to state law, most proceeds from bingo games must be used for 
charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency and the Social Service Agency were scheduled to go to 
Norwalk Superior Court on Aug. 17 to resolve the rent issue, but the city 
decided that the dispute had gone on too long and cost too much, Mayor Tom 
Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a lot of sense to work out a settlement that both parties can live 
with," Thurman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Fees 
</P>
<P>
He said the city was spending between $10,000 and $15,000 in legal fees. The 
Downey law firm of Solton, Jacobs, Weiss, Castagno and Sims was representing 
Graham of the Social Service Agency for free, Castagno said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Graham: "This whole thing was a political fiasco. It has hurt everybody so 
badly." 
</P>
<P>
The agency and the city have been squabbling on a variety of fronts since last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, funding for the nonprofit agency was dropped after city 
auditors said it did not have an "adequate financial control system." 
</P>
<P>
The Social Service Agency received more than $130,000 from various government 
agencies channeled through the city during fiscal 1986-87. Another $50,000 had 
been earmarked for the agency for fiscal 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contracts Expired 
</P>
<P>
In October, the city contracted with two other nonprofit agencies to provide 
social services to residents. Those contracts expired June 30, and city 
officials have not acted to renew them. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by the city's cutoff of funding for the Social Service Agency, some 
residents made an unsuccessful attempt to recall Councilmen Robertson and 
Joseph Graffio. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Cudahy Social Service Foundation plan's to conduct bingo games to 
raise money for the agency, the city could also receive a licensing fee of 1% 
of the monthly gross bingo revenues over $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to city records, Graham is one of the foundation's seven directors. 
Earlier, Graham, Mgrdichian and Councilman Wilfred Colon proposed holding bingo 
games in the building the Cudahy Social Service Agency is renting. However, the 
proposal stalled when other council members opposed holding bingo games on 
city-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval of Mgrdichian's current bingo application, after a background 
check by police and a city review of construction plans, could come within two 
weeks, City Manager Gerald Caton said.

WILLIG ERA ENDS; 
</P>
<P>
6 BROTHERS MADE GRID HISTORY AT ST. PAUL HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the youngest of the six has grown up, all of their childhoods, which 
had been rich with competition, companionship and endless containers of milk, 
have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Willig went off to college this week. 
</P>
<P>
He is the last of the Willig brothers of La Mirada, all of whom were 
inspirational football stars at St. Paul High School in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been kind of the baby. It's hard to imagine him getting ready to go 
away," said Chuck Willig, the oldest of the brothers. They gathered Sunday at 
their uncle's San Dimas home for a goodby party for Greg, the quarterback who 
next morning would head for Houston and Rice University. 
</P>
<P>
Watched by relatives with cameras, the brothers -- close friends and all, 
except Greg, thick-legged and in their 20s -- fooled around with a football in 
the back yard. Chuck, 29, who took some kidding because of his receding 
hairline, is now the big brother only in age. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Now They're All Huge' 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a senior, they were all smaller than me," he said. "Now they're all 
huge." 
</P>
<P>
Though Chuck, a 6-footer, did not look that small next to 225-pound Chris and 
245-pound Craig, he appeared almost diminutive when he stood beside the three 
younger brothers -- Bob, a brawny 6-5; Matt, the epitome of a college lineman 
at 6-8, and Greg, lean but 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
From Chuck in 1975 through Greg last fall, the Willig name was synonymous with 
St. Paul football. In those 14 years the Swordsmen had a 98-36-1 record. Five 
of the brothers were team captains. Four won scholarships. All made the 
all-Angelus League team. Three were All-CIF in football, and Greg won that 
honor in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
That made Charles and Genevieve Willig, who came to California from 
Pennsylvania 28 years ago, the only parents in St. Paul history to have had 
four All-CIF sons. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck's Friday-night exploits, before packed grandstands that always included 
his parents and brothers, left big footsteps for the others to follow. A 
cornerback, he had 15 pass interceptions -- still a state record -- as an 
All-CIF senior in 1977, and 21 in his career, during which St. Paul won three 
league championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Having him behind me was just a good feeling of support," Miguel Olmedo, a 
former linebacker and now the St. Paul coach, said of his old teammate. "He led 
by example, and vocally as well." 
</P>
<P>
Remembering one of Chuck's games against rival Servite High, in which he played 
defensive back, receiver and quarterback, his father said: "He passed out after 
the game from the excitement and tension." 
</P>
<P>
After playing at Northern Arizona University, Chuck worked for a bank for five 
years and then returned to St. Paul in 1987 as an assistant football coach. He 
has been offensive coordinator the last two seasons. Married, with two 
daughters, he lives in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tried to put following in my footsteps out of my brothers' minds and 
tried to get them to aspire to do well as individuals," Chuck said. "I tried to 
take off some of the pressure they thought other people put on them because 
they were Willigs and were expected to do well." 
</P>
<P>
If the other brothers felt any pressure, it never diminished their performance. 
</P>
<P>
Twins came next -- Chris, a linebacker with a stability that enabled him to 
take over the older-brother role when Chuck left for college, and Craig, a 
defensive tackle who thrived on emotion. Though he was the only Willig who 
wasn't team captain, Craig still won the Swordsmen's most-inspirational award 
as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
They finished their St. Paul careers in 1980, Craig's ending tragically in the 
season's last game. He shattered his knee and his football future when he 
knocked a Bishop Amat punt returner five yards through the air. After an 
unsuccessful attempt at rehabilitation, Craig decided to forgo college. He got 
married and became a truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
Chris went on to play two years at Cerritos College and was the team's most 
valuable player his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
They are 26 now, still with short haircuts. Craig lives with his wife and three 
daughters in Buena Park and drives a truck for an independent grocer. Chris is 
single, lives in Anaheim and works in an oil company's credit department. 
</P>
<P>
Bob followed the twins. A lanky All-CIF linebacker in 1983, he was known for 
his frenetic dancing and loud behavior as much as for his tackles in "The Pit," 
the popular name for the St. Paul football field. He played defensive tackle at 
the University of Washington, graduating this summer at age 23. 
</P>
<P>
Matt, 20, the second-youngest of the brothers and the most imposing, was 
All-CIF in 1986, winning a scholarship to USC, where in the fall he will be a 
sophomore tackle. He is the only Willig, his father said, who did not show 
enthusiasm for football at an early age, preferring soccer and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looked Up to Them' 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up to all of them; they were all different but they were all marked 
by competitiveness," said Greg, 18, who turned out to be the family's most 
versatile performer. He set a myriad of St. Paul passing records, including 237 
career completions. In basketball last season he averaged 27 points and 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the most laid-back of all of us," Chuck said of Greg, who will 
play only football at Rice. "A congenial type of kid, real level-headed. He was 
a fantastic leader for us." 
</P>
<P>
Greg said he was always a little further along than other athletes his age 
because of all the brotherly advice he received through the years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's learned a little bit from everybody," Bob said. 
</P>
<P>
But Greg has never become carried away with himself. No Willig was allowed to. 
</P>
<P>
"They always got constructive criticism and ribbing from each other," Genevieve 
said. "They didn't have a chance to get a big head." 
</P>
<P>
At the party Sunday, the brothers hoisted their parents, whom they've always 
looked up to anyway, onto their shoulders for a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, 52, a former semipro lineman whose hair vanished long ago, retired in 
January after 28 years, most of them as a patrolman, with the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our role model," Chuck said. "He taught us the discipline to be 
successful. He always encouraged us to do the best we could, but he didn't 
push. When things got tough, we looked to him for inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Around the house, each of the boys had a job to do and rules to follow. 
"Anytime they went out to a party, they had to leave the address where they 
would be," Charles said. "And they had a time when they had to be home. When 
Chris was 26 and living at home (he moved out recently), he couldn't stay out 
all night." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers thus were adequately prepared for St. Paul football, which demands 
hard work and adherence to traditions. Swordsmen voluntarily shave their heads 
before each season. Before each game, dressed in blazer, tie and slacks, they 
walk hand in hand down the field. After each game, in a candle-lit chapel, they 
say the Rosary. 
</P>
<P>
"With six brothers (there were no sisters), and our father working, we had an 
atmosphere of sharing at home," Chuck said. "It carried over to St. Paul. It 
was almost second nature. We just applied it to football and everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
As students, the brothers ranged from average to pretty good. Chris and Craig 
were in the National Honor Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Always Home 
</P>
<P>
While Charles was a hero to his sons, he was not always home, often working two 
jobs. But Genevieve, a gracious, dark-haired woman with glasses, was always 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"She was responsible for just about everything," Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the heart and soul of the family," his oldest son added. "She did all 
the little things for us. She drove us to practice every day, she was (at the 
school) working when she was needed, she was involved in our activities 
constantly. Mom was under a lot of pressure to do a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Marc Viens, the St. Paul sports statistician, has been a longtime friend of the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"You have seven men, so big, and yet you look at the mother and she's the 
common bond," Viens said. "She is such a quality individual, and she instilled 
her personal qualities in her six boys. To meet her is to instantly love her. 
</P>
<P>
"She is warm and outgoing; (Charles) is stoic and intense. The blend of the two 
produced a good corps of young men." 
</P>
<P>
As they sat in their living room last week, it was hard for Charles and 
Genevieve to realize that everybody's gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still cooking as though there were still eight of us," Genevieve said, 
recalling countless bags of groceries. For years, she would buy six 
half-gallons of milk every other day. 
</P>
<P>
There are scrapbooks, made by each of the brothers, in the Willig home, but 
they are not often opened. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any of us who really dwell on the accomplishments," Chuck said. 
"We all kind of moved on." 
</P>
<P>
There is no seventh son to succeed Greg, and for the parents that is just as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that six was kind of enough," Genevieve said. 
</P>
<P>
But they'll both miss the shouts out in the driveway, where the competition was 
as fierce as it was on the football field or in the living room, where the 
brothers would push back the furniture to create a playing arena when their 
parents went out. 
</P>
<P>
The basket is gone now; it's at Craig's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it down; I could never get anything to grow out there," Charles said. 
"And I just replaced the garage door." 
</P>
<P>
The old door, which suffered as much as the hedge and the flowers under the 
daily barrage of big bodies, had been knocked out of alignment many games ago. 
</P>
<P>
The boys always tried to stick the flowers back in the ground. Good at yard 
work, they always cut the grass with an old hand mower. Now Charles will have 
to cut it himself, although he'll have it easier than his sons did. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, they bought him a new mower. One with a motor.

ANGRY PICO RIVERA PARENTS SAY SAGGING SCHOOL TEST SCORES ARE NO JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice LaHeist says she likes to march into school board meetings in Pico Rivera 
wearing her white T-shirt with blue lettering emblazoned across the front and 
back: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a concerned parent. Are you? E.R.U.S.D. Support Quality Education!" 
</P>
<P>
The shirt is an attention-getter, LaHeist says -- a way to let officials of the 
El Rancho Unified School District know that her children are not receiving the 
education she expects. 
</P>
<P>
LaHeist is a member of a growing group of disgruntled Pico Rivera parents who 
are upset over lower-than-average standardized test scores and preliminary 
reports -- which officials dispute -- that the 13,200-student district has a 
50% dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago I heard that the El Rancho school district was going to be one 
of the premier school districts in the area," said LaHeist, who has five 
children. "Ha! Our district is a joke. And when you become a joke, it's not 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't expect our children to be achievers, and we want that changed," 
LaHeist continued. "We want them to be expected to be the president of the U.S. 
These are our future leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Supt. Norbert Genis said district officials plan to work with the 
parents to help solve the district's problems. About 30 parents meet regularly 
to discuss education in the district. Some of their concerns are valid, Genis 
said, but administrators are "not about to say our program is going down the 
tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Thomas Sakalis said: "We feel we have the basis for a strong education 
program, but we're continually trying to find out if there are places we could 
be doing better. If the parents have concerns, we will listen to them." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the parents and school administrators heated up several 
months ago when the state reported that the dropout rate in the El Rancho 
school district is 50%, more than twice that of surrounding districts. 
</P>
<P>
Later, El Rancho district officials announced that a mistake had been made: 
Someone had accidentally submitted the wrong numbers to the state. Sakalis said 
the dropout rate is actually about 20%, the Los Angeles County average. 
</P>
<P>
Too late, LaHeist said. The damage was already done. "We became a 
laughingstock," she said. "We were embarrassed in front of the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
Said Angie Lora, a mother of two: "I'd talk to parents in other districts and 
they would tell me: 'I wouldn't touch your district with 10-foot pole. I'd move 
out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, what began as a gathering of seven unhappy mothers grew to a vocal 
group of more than 30 concerned parents, said Stella Millan, who has four 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"We started talking more," Millan said. "The more we talked, the angrier we 
became. It wasn't just something affecting my children; it was something 
concerning all of our children, the district's children." 
</P>
<P>
Group members took a closer look at standardized test scores. They discovered 
that the average eighth-grade reading score for 1988-89 was 58 points lower 
than the average third-grade score. Third-graders scored 262, slightly above 
the county average, while eighth-graders scored 204, 24 points below the county 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Something was breaking down in the school system between the third and the 
eighth grade, the parents said, and they wanted to know what. 
</P>
<P>
Genis said school officials are asking the same question. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're trying to analyze now," he said, adding that the problem may 
be caused by the district's approach to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Children Are Different' 
</P>
<P>
"We still are using methods from 60, 70 years ago," he said. "The children are 
different than they were than. We've been trying to fit a round peg into a 
square hole." 
</P>
<P>
Genis said this approach may also be contributing to the dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Students are bored," Stella Millan said. "By the time my son got to junior 
high, he didn't want to go to school. I kept saying, 'Next year it will get 
better.' Well, guess what? My son has graduated, but I had a heck of a time 
keeping him in school. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts me to no end to think that I didn't do enough to get my son a better 
education," Millan continued. "I won't do that again." 
</P>
<P>
Next fall, Millan said, she will place her youngest child in a private school. 
But she still plans to participate in the El Rancho parents' group. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to go away," LaHeist said. "We're just going to keep rattling 
their cages." 
</P>
<P>
Genis said he welcomes the parents' interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have involvement from parents we've never had before," he said. "I'd like 
to join hands and see how we can utilize available funding and improve our 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all interested in a better education."

COMPTON HOTEL DEBUT DELAYED; 80 LAID OFF JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, Times Staff Writer

COMPTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scheduled opening next week of the $35-million Compton Lazben Hotel has 
been delayed again, and 80 hotel workers already on the payroll for training 
purposes have been laid off without warning. 
</P>
<P>
Developer and builder Naftali Deutsch said Wednesday the hotel probably will 
open within two months. "We are an eyelash away from opening the hotel," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 15 opening date had been only "a best estimate, (but) there were just 
too many things to pull together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to provide Deutsch a cash 
advance of $525,000 from funds that city officials were withholding until the 
hotel is completed and open for business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feels Like Being Held Hostage 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore, who opposed the advance, said she felt like she 
was "being held hostage. I don't know what it is going to take for us to stop 
this fiasco." Councilman Maxcy Filer also voted against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bernice Woods, the newest member of the City Council, who was casting her first 
vote on a hotel issue, provided the swing vote in favor of the developer. 
Councilwoman Jane Robbins and Mayor Walter R. Tucker have consistently 
supported the hotel project. 
</P>
<P>
The majority released the money, they said, because they did not want to hold 
up the project and keep people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch was not at the council meeting but said Wednesday morning that 
construction is virtually finished, and that only furniture and fixtures remain 
to be installed. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Williams, a private consultant who until last month was on contract 
with the city to help generate business for the hotel, said there is so much 
unfinished construction work that the hotel may not open completely until the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He said some of the hotel's 288 rooms and one or two of the three restaurants 
could be opened in two months. 
</P>
<P>
City officials would not speculate on a new opening date for the hotel, which 
is at the south end of town, alongside the Artesia Freeway. Shelia McDaniel, 
personnel director for the hotel, said she told workers they would be called 
back in two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The latest delay is the third on the hotel and convention center complex, which 
originally was scheduled to open in May, 1988. The opening date later was set 
for last December. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped Work for 5 Months 
</P>
<P>
In November, though, Deutsch stopped work for five months, saying he needed $3 
million more in city loans to complete the job. He previously had received 
$5.25 million in loans from the city, which is in a joint venture with Deutsch 
on the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In April, construction resumed after the City Council and the developer each 
promised to deposit $1.5 million in the loan fund. Deutsch actually deposited 
$1.4 million, said City Controller Timothy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Filer said city officials and Deutsch agreed that $825,000 of the total loan 
money of $8.25 million would be held in a retention fund -- pending completion 
of the hotel -- to ensure that any liens against Deutsch filed by 
subcontractors and building-material suppliers would be paid, Filer said. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch said Wednesday that the money in the retention fund is his and should 
never have been held up because it is being paid out jointly by him and the 
city to contractors and suppliers. 
</P>

city in April was used to pay off liens.

An angry Moore recalled that last week the hotel's management staff came before 
the council and talked about all the Compton residents who had been hired at 
the hotel. "And Friday they laid them off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 137 people were on the hotel payroll, personnel director McDaniel said. 
Eighty -- mostly maids, waiters and busboys who were being trained -- were laid 
off, some having earned only a few days' pay.

One laid-off worker, Mary Ann Moore of Compton, said, "They called me Tuesday 
night and told me to report to work Wednesday morning." Monday she was laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who is no relation to the councilwoman, said she is luckier than some 
people who were laid off because she did not leave another job when she was 
hired at the hotel. She said a friend, however, quit a job to start work at the 
hotel last week. 
</P>
<P>
Jona M. Liebrecht said the workers had to be laid off because of the delayed 
opening, but that all of the management staff, as well as the security 
personnel, are still on payroll.

SUSPECTS IN 14 BANK HOLDUPS RUN OUT OF LUCK IN OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two suspected bank robbers believed by the FBI to have robbed a total of 14 
banks in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties during the last month were arrested 
this week -- one after a routine traffic stop and the other after a bicycle 
chase in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Auer, agent-in-charge of the FBI's Ventura County office, identified the 
two suspected robbers as Bruno Gilbert Torres, 24 and Raymond E. Hilliard II, 
22, both of Oxnard. He said Torres is suspected in 10 robberies, including 
seven in Ventura County, and Hilliard is a suspect in four robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Torres tried to escape when he was stopped for a routine traffic violation by 
Oxnard police, but ran into the back yard of an off-duty Ventura County 
sheriff's deputy who held him at gunpoint until arresting officers arrived, 
Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliard was surrounded by the FBI and Oxnard police at an Oxnard motel and 
tried to escape on a bicycle, Auer added. He said Hilliard reached speeds of 25 
m.p.h. on the bike as he tried to escape in a scene reminiscent of the bicycle 
chase scene in the movie "E.T." 
</P>
<P>
The recent surge of bank robberies in Ventura County, which the FBI links 
primarily to Torres and Hilliard, has put the year's total bank robberies for 
the county at 34, surpassing last year's total of 31, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Auer, who took charge of the FBI's Ventura County office in 1986, said bank 
robberies that year totaled 71. The number was reduced to 60 in 1987 and 
dropped to 31 last year before's this year's increase.

AUTO PLAZA SALE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by a truck sales and service firm to locate in the Compton Auto 
Plaza was rejected Tuesday night by the City Council, which reiterated that it 
will not approve the sale of property there by Brett Mitchell, whose auto 
dealership closed owing the city money. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and Universal Mack Truck Sales and Services Inc. have an agreement 
under which the Mack franchise will pay $3.9 million for the property -- $1.4 
million more than the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members pointed out angrily that they gave Mitchell title to the 
property last fall for $2.5 million but that he never made a single mortgage 
payment. He also owes the city more than $100,000 for loans it gave him. 
</P>
<P>
Under its original agreement with Mitchell, the council says, he cannot sell 
the property without council approval. The council has begun legal action to 
take back the property. The dealership was closed by the state in December for 
tax and license irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
The council told Universal Mack that it was not sure it wanted a truck service 
business so close to the city's new hotel, which adjoins the auto plaza. The 
council told its staff and Universal to work together to come up with other 
possible sites.

HOUSING PROJECT APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday approved plans for the largest single-family housing 
development in the city since it was incorporated in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4-0 for a proposal by M. K. Development of South Pasadena to 
build 32 three-bedroom homes on 2.9 acres on Elizabeth Street. The action 
reversed the Planning Commission's denial of the developer's request to build 
the homes on 4,000-square-foot lots rather than the 6,000-square-foot lots 
required by zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to encourage other developers to build housing in the 
1.1-square-mile city of 20,000 people, Acting Planning Director Brad Tarr said.

WELL CLEANUP STUDY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved hiring a Pasadena engineering firm to study how 
to remove excessive iron and manganese from a municipal water well. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Montgomery Engineers Inc. has been awarded a $20,000 contract to 
figure out how to treat the well, which the city built last year but never 
operated because the chemicals exceeded state health limits. 
</P>
<P>
The study will also determine how much it will cost to remove the contaminants, 
Public Works Director Joseph Y. Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
Six other wells provide more than enough water for the city, Wang said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE MEMORIAL PLANS CARDIAC UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center has announced that it will begin 
construction this fall on a $21-million cardiac care center as part of the 
hospital's 3-year-old East End expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
About half of all patients at the hospital are treated for illnesses directly 
or indirectly related to cardiovascular disease, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the 120,000-square-foot facility will become Glendale's first 
cardiac care center. Construction is to begin in November, and hospital 
officials have estimated the building will be finished in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Services to be provided include an emergency department specializing in heart 
care, two cardiac catheterization laboratories, operating rooms and diagnostic 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The center will make up 45% of a $24-million addition to the Los Feliz 
Boulevard structure. 
</P>
<P>
Among the expansion and renovation on the eastern portion of the hospital 
grounds has been installation of an $8.5-million underground warehouse and 
central plant, a $3.7-million parking structure and a $3-million cancer center. 
A new lobby has also been added.

Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 291 to 123, the House approved a fiscal 1990 budget of $1.6 
billion for itself and congressional support agencies. That is an increase of 
14% over the comparable fiscal 1989 bill. After the Senate adds its budget of 
more than $400 million, the cost of operating the legislative branch in 1990 
will top $2 billion. Members' salaries of nearly $50 million are funded 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
Among items in the House-passed bill are $188 million for the salaries of House 
members' personal staffs (up 5% from comparable 1989 figure), $118 million for 
committee operations including staff salaries (up 7%) and $123 million for 
House members' and senators' free-mail privileges. The postage sum is 
open-ended and likely to be increased, despite new language reducing from six 
to four the number of mass mailings House members can send to constituents each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 206 to 219, the House refused to further restrict abortion in the 
District of Columbia. The defeated amendment sought to renew a ban on the 
district using its own revenue as well as its federal payment to provide 
abortions for the poor. It also sought to toughen the ban so that the 
district's own money could no longer be spent on abortions deemed necessary 
because the mother's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred during debate on the D.C. appropriations bill for fiscal 
1990, later sent to the Senate. It liberalizes federal abortion law as it is 
applied to D.C. But the federal city remains severely restricted in using money 
it gets from the U.S. Treasury for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to further restrict public funding of abortions in 
D.C.

Savings and Loan Rescue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 170 to 250, the House rejected a GOP attempt to put the cost of 
the savings and loan rescue off the federal budget. The vote kept the thrift 
bailout bill from being sent back to a House-Senate conference committee where 
the off-budget language was to have been added. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the bill was returned to conference, following the Senate's 
refusal to waive the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law to permit counting the 
multibillion-dollar bailout as part of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was how to treat about $50 billion in immediate borrowing needed to 
close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts and meet insurance obligations to 
depositors. The reworked bill taken up by the House and Senate late Friday put 
$20 billion of the borrowing on this year's budget, as most Democrats wanted, 
and left the remaining $30 billion to be raised by industry bonds as advocated 
by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported an off-budget financing arrangement for the 
savings and loan bailout.

'REDUCING CRIME BY PREVENTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your lead story (Times, July 27) dealt with the recently released independent 
Long Beach study of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The study clearly shows that the city does not need the 25% increase in 
officers (about $16 million per year) that Police Chief Lawrence Binkley and 
the City Council have been asking for, if the present police force is used more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as your story reports, some council members are still calling for more 
police. Do they seriously think the public will vote to raise their taxes to 
subsidize an inefficiently managed Police Department? 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach now has a golden opportunity to do something about reducing crime by 
prevention, not simply by pouring more police on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed is to apply all available -- and some new -- funding sources in 
combating the causes of crime (through) programs such as drug rehabilitation 
centers, parks and recreation, job training and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering placing a $6-million special tax on the ballot to 
enhance recreational facilities. These are the kinds of crime-fighting programs 
Long Beach needs.

CALL FOR ACTION ON HAZARDOUS WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While (Long Beach) City Auditor Robert Fronke is to be commended for his 
evaluation of the city's hazardous waste materials operations (Times, Aug. 5), 
it is important for the public to be made aware of the reasons for any 
inadequacies attributed to the city Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
First, until this budget year, the Department of Public Health has received 
funding from the council for only one full-time staff person to manage its 
hazardous waste materials operations. (The remainder of the duties were to be 
assumed by the Fire Department.) This year, the department received approval 
for three additional staff. 
</P>
<P>
Second, although the council passed legislation to require the inspection of 
underground tanks, it did not appropriate funds for inspectors. Moreover, 
inspections are costly -- these large tanks must be dug up, inspected, replaced 
and/or repaired (at a cost of between $50,000 and $100,000 per tank) -- making 
it unlikely that small businesses will voluntarily step forward to speed up the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Third, inspection of leaking underground tanks barely scratches the surface of 
the magnitude of problems taking place in our city boundaries concerning the 
handling and disposal of hazardous waste materials. Our sewers, bays, flood 
control (channels) and alleys are more and more frequently the dumping grounds 
for both industrial and household hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
The city not only needs to expend funds on monitoring and enforcement efforts 
(which it should be able to recoup through aggressive prosecution in the 
courts), but must grapple with how it can provide education to both businesses 
and households on how and where to safely dispose of hazardous materials in a 
city where over 400,000 people live and work. 
</P>
<P>
The news account of the audit did not indicate suggestions to improve the 
city's monitoring and enforcement efforts. Perhaps two suggestions are in 
order: 1) the city prosecutor's office establish an environmental enforcement 
unit which can investigate and prosecute those who illegally dispose of 
hazardous waste materials in the city; and, 2) the City Council approve an 
increase in city business license fees for those businesses that handle, 
produce, store, dispose of and/or transport hazardous waste materials in Long 
Beach. These fees would fund the additional staff which should have been in 
place four years ago.

LONG BEACH REVOKES BALLROOM'S LICENSE IN WAKE OF COMPLAINTS

<P>
Acting on complaints of noise, littering and drug use and drug sales, the City 
Council has voted unanimously to revoke the business license of Fender's 
International Grand Ballroom, which showcases heavy metal and punk bands on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Department of Financial Management recommended the action. A 
department report said the owner of the downtown nightspot, John Fender, failed 
to comply with repeated requests from the city to halt rowdiness allegedly 
caused by patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The council also revoked licenses for two party rooms and Player's Sports Bar, 
a bar and grill that Fender owns on the same block. The ballroom is at 521 E. 
1st St. 
</P>
<P>
"This man has stomped on his neighbors; he's raised havoc," Councilman Wallace 
Edgerton said. "If he would have been in my district, I would have shut him 
down a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents complain that they have been harassed by patrons loitering in 
the area and littering. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, rock fans outside Fender's skirmished with Long Beach police who had 
cut off further access to a concert in an overcrowded room. 
</P>
<P>
Fender has contended that patrons have not caused all of the problems. "We're 
in downtown Long Beach and have only one show a week, while the area's got 
problems seven days a week," he said last month in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Fender left the hearing last week saying: "It isn't over yet." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, M. Lawrence Lallande, said he plans to seek a Superior Court 
order to force the City Council to schedule another hearing for Fender. 
</P>
<P>
Lallande said Fender has been preoccupied by a five-week criminal trial that 
recently concluded when a jury convicted Fender of helping steal more than 
$141,000 from Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank in 1987. He had been accused of 
conspiring with a bank teller to cover his overdrafts with bogus deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Fender, who is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 22, faces a prison term of up to 
five years.

U.S. CLOSES POPULAR RECREATION SITE;

<P>
BUBONIC PLAGUE FOUND IN SQUIRRELS AT PINE MOUNTAIN AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNA GOWENLOCK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service has temporarily closed the Pine Mountain Recreation 
Area north of Ojai in the wake of a bubonic plague infestation in squirrels 
found in one of the area's two campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service blocked the entrance to the four-square-mile area's only 
access road, off California 33 about 30 miles north of Ojai, said Steve Horne, 
a Forest Service employee. The move thwarted campers, hunters, hikers and 
hang-glider pilots who take off from Pine Mountain's 5,084-foot peak, Horne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The closure will last past the beginning of bow-hunting season on Aug. 19, and 
could be in effect until October, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands annually flock to the area, which includes two semiprimitive 
campgrounds and some majestic scenery, including a view southwest across the 
Oxnard Plain to the Channel Islands and northward into the Cuyama Badlands, 
Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
During a routine check last month, the Ventura County Department of 
Environmental Health discovered that squirrels in one of the Pine Mountain 
campgrounds were infested with plague-carrying fleas. 
</P>
<P>
After the discovery -- the first "in recent memory" in the Ojai Range area, 
Horne said -- the Forest Service shut the campground, and the county tried to 
kill the fleas by dousing rodent burrows with insecticidal dust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plague-Carrying Fleas 
</P>
<P>
But warning signs about the plague discovery failed to deter vacationers, Horne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were having trouble keeping people out of the closed campground," he said. 
"We'd drive up to check on the area, and people would be picnicking right next 
to the sign that said 'bubonic plague.' " 
</P>
<P>
That forced officials to take the more drastic step of eliminating access to 
the entire area, Horne said. The area will remain closed until the 
plague-carrying fleas are eradicated, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dusting failed to bring the campground's flea population down to 
an acceptable level -- about half a flea per squirrel, said Randall Smith, 
Ventura County environmental health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The county is waiting for the state to deliver a more powerful insecticide 
before it tries again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not That Unusual 
</P>
<P>
Smith said plague is not all that unusual in wild rodent populations throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bloom of plague or anything like that," he said. "We know that 
there is plague in Los Padres National Forest. It's scattered throughout the 
forest. We just look in campgrounds because that's where most people would come 
into contact with it." 
</P>
<P>
Another Ventura County campground, Chuchupate, near Frazier Park, has been 
closed since 1981 because of bubonic plague infestation. The county's 
Department of Environmental Health is conducting a plague ecology study in an 
effort to track it in the animal population and find a way to successfully 
eradicate the carrier fleas, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the study is due to be completed next summer.

OXNARD STILL AT ODDS WITH EMPLOYEE UNIONS OVER RAISES, BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations with most of Oxnard's city employees who have been without a 
contract since July 9 remained deadlocked, negotiators said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Only the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 501, which represents 
the city's approximately 342 blue-collar workers, had not declared an impasse 
by Wednesday, said union spokesman Ron Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are still negotiating in good faith," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But relations were not as smooth with either the Public Employees Assn. of 
Ventura County, which represents the city's 305 clerical, professional and 
technical workers, and the International Assn. of Firefighters Local 1684, 
which represents 87 rank-and-file members of Oxnard's Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters' union called in a state mediator to settle the dispute in the 
middle of July, and early last week the public employees' union followed suit. 
The mediator, Draza (Merv) Mrvichin, took the unusual step of meeting Tuesday 
with City Council members, but neither side would disclose what happened in the 
closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noisy Picketing 
</P>
<P>
In a noisy display of dismay, public employees' union members picketed Oxnard 
City Hall for two hours on Tuesday, carrying signs that referred to pinched 
fiscal conditions at the city, which hopes to save 6% on salaries by filling 
vacancies more slowly than usual. "Don't balance the budget on my back," one 
sign read. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard firefighters have been less demonstrative. Union president Bill Gallaher 
declined to detail the union's demands but said that in addition to wage 
increases it is asking for improved working conditions in the department, where 
cutbacks have forced some firefighters to shoulder additional responsibilities. 
The budget cuts also have caused the sporadic closure of some fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the situation," he said, "but I'd prefer to give the city 
one more opportunity to come across." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hammitt, public employees' union executive director, was more open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management to Get Raise 
</P>
<P>
The city, which last month agreed to give management a 3.9% increase, has 
offered the public employees a two-year contract that calls for a 3.3% salary 
increase this year, effective in November. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, under the city's proposal, employees would be given either a 3.5% 
increase with added health benefits or a 4% increase with no new health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The union is asking for a raise of 4.2% -- the consumer price index -- and a 
salary increase next year of between 4% and 10%, depending on the consumer 
price index, with some health benefits, Hammitt said. This year's raise would 
be retroactive to July. 
</P>
<P>
Under both scenarios, salaries that fall below those being offered for 
comparable jobs in comparable cities would be adjusted upward in April. But 
Dene Jones, Oxnard personnel and employee relations director, said there has 
been some disagreement over just which cities are comparable.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two federal grants supported in part by Lockheed Aerospace Corp. will enable 
Compton Community College to bring nearly $1.2 million in assistance to high 
school students in Compton, Lynwood and Paramount, a college spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The separate grants from the U.S. Department of Education are both aimed at 
encouraging teen-agers to complete high school and go to college, said 
administrator Ron Chatman, whose office drafted the original proposals. He said 
Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton) and Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson 
"supported our cause." 
</P>
<P>
A three-year, $750,000 grant under the School, College, and University 
Partnership program will benefit at least 300 10th- and 11th-graders in the 
Compton, Lynwood and Paramount school districts who have academic potential. 
Another 75 students interested in computer-assisted drafting and engineering 
will receive tutoring, counseling, college-level instruction and job 
internships through Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year, $420,000 grant under the Upward Bound program will benefit 150 
10th- through 12th-graders in the three school districts. Upward Bound will 
include an academic year program, a summer program and a summer bridge program 
for graduating seniors. The summer sessions will be held on the Compton College 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
During the academic year, activities will focus on basic skills and academic, 
personal and career counseling. During the summer program, each student will be 
required to enroll in four basic skills courses and work with a tutor. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the summer bridge program will take two regular college courses 
and receive counseling and tutoring.

HOME OF ANGELS PROVIDES HAVEN FOR THE HOPELESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stephanie, a 6-year-old from San Bernardino County, fell into her family's 
Ontario swimming pool three years ago and nearly drowned. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the day, she lies in a crib, her limbs motionless and her eyes 
fixed on the ceiling. Her parents come to visit almost every day, but whether 
she recognizes them is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, on a blanket printed with pastel birds, is James, a 1-year-old who was 
born with an undeveloped brain. His skull is a wrinkled protrusion that stops a 
little above his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
He can smile and cry, but nurses say he will never be able to do much more. He 
is fed through a tube in his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
A nurse, massaging his arms, said, "He won't make it to his teens." 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie and James are two patients at the Home of Angels in Ontario, a 
private nursing home that for 17 years has cared for the most difficult of 
difficult cases: children who have suffered disabilities so extreme that there 
is no hope of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the few facilities outside of state hospitals that provide care 
for the severely disabled, and it draws patients from throughout California and 
Nevada, although most are from Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be no other place like it in the state," said Verlin Woolley of the 
Inland Regional Center, a state agency serving disabled people and finding 
appropriate facilities for them. "It's a rather unique facility." 
</P>
<P>
The patients suffer from near drownings, birth defects caused by their parents' 
drug use, severe mental retardation, congenital deformities and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Mavis Moretta, the home's administrator, said the home, unlike other nursing 
facilities, does not concentrate on educating and counseling patients. Mostly, 
it just tries to keep them comfortable and attend to their constant medical 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overwhelming Experience 
</P>
<P>
For some people, such as an aide who quit on her first day at work last week, 
seeing these children can be an overwhelming experience. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara McCord, the home's director of nursing, said caring for the 
children has its rewards. There are no miracles but occasional small gains: a 
garbled word or a fleeting moment of eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
The Home of Angels was started in 1965 by the late Dr. Donald W. Fawcett, an 
Ontario obstetrician and pediatrician who opened a nursery for mentally 
retarded children when his failing eyesight forced him to curtail his practice. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, it changed its mission: to care for only the most severely disabled, 
most of whom could not speak or walk. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the facility cares for 59 patients. The state pays for their care, 
providing $52.62 a day for each. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients are children, although a few are in their 20s and 30s. 
Some are transferred to a state hospital or another nursing home when they get 
older; many die before their teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varying Degrees 
</P>
<P>
The list of ailments is long. Most suffer from varying degrees of physical 
deformity, mental retardation and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
Most patients see only the home's staff. Parents often find it too difficult to 
deal with their children's disabilities and rarely visit, Moretta said. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel, who was born with no limbs or nose or upper lip, died last November 
when he was 6. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the home when he was a week old. His mother visited him in the first 
few weeks, but never came again. 
</P>
<P>
Timmy, 21, was born with a shrunken brain and is one of the home's oldest 
patients. He has lived there since he was an infant and has never had visitors. 
</P>
<P>
McCord said one mother makes an hourlong commute every day to visit her 
5-year-old son, Juan, who suffers from profound retardation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Daily Devotion 
</P>
<P>
There are bright spots, however, at the Home of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
The voice of Susie, who suffers from a rare and sometimes fatal skin disease 
called epidermolysis bullosa, pierces the hallways, where the sound of coughing 
or crying is the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Susie's disease, which has no cure, has left her body covered with open sores 
and scarred tissue. Because of her disease, she must stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
And there are a few who have gone home. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago, an Orange County boy was brought to the home after 
falling into a coma, Moretta said. 
</P>
<P>
His father was a gardener, and doctors guessed that the 4-year-old had 
swallowed an insecticide or some other garden chemical. 
</P>
<P>
At first he was like many of the other patients, unable to move or respond to 
the people around him. 
</P>

to walk, then to run.

Within six months, he had recovered and returned home to his family.

THE PLANET, SHELTER ON SKID ROW, BURNS; 
</P>
<P>
APPARENTLY DERANGED MAN BLAMED; 'ABSOLUTELY NOTHING' LEFT FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Another Planet, an abandoned Skid Row gas station that had been converted to a 
shelter and cultural center for the homeless, was destroyed early Wednesday by 
a fire that eyewitnesses said was set by a transient who appeared to be 
mentally deranged. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they were investigating reports that the fire was set on 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incident Related 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Mercer, a homeless man who works as a volunteer at the Planet, said in 
an interview that he believed the incident was linked to an altercation Tuesday 
night with a homeless man who insisted that center volunteers waive their 
policy and store his duffel bag. The shelter accepts only boxes for storage. 
</P>
<P>
The man threatened center officials, according to Mercer and other 
eyewitnesses, and returned later in the night to the center, at of Wall and 
Boyd Streets. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began around 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"He (the transient) was in the room where the fire started," said Mercer, who 
was asleep in a 6-foot-high loft. "I was face to face with the fire. I jumped 
down and shouted 'Fire! Fire!' and got the people out of the building." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 Others Escape 
</P>
<P>
About 10 others escaped injuries, but within minutes, the building was gutted. 
Firefighters took about 10 minutes to put out the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
No damage figure was calculated by officials, but some of the homeless said 
they lost everything they owned -- blankets, sleeping bags, clothes and other 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
John Orono, 26, who handled the Planet's storage operation, said at least 78 
boxes containing property of homeless people went up in the flames. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here didn't have much. Now they have nothing," he said. "Absolutely 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Others said their losses could not be quantified. "My nine years' work of 
writing and planning are gone," said Barbara Frost, an organizer of the 
homeless, who also lived at the Planet. "Now I have to start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
The abandoned Skid Row gas station was eccentrically decorated and was the site 
for poetry readings, video screenings, chess tournaments, jam sessions, games 
and live entertainment by Skid Row artists. Two pianos, a video recorder and a 
television set also were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Planet moved in, the abandoned gas station had been used as a 
parking lot for patrons of the avant-garde Wallenboyd Theater, which was 
located across the street until the spring of 1988, when the theater's owner 
decided to move. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeless people said they preferred the Planet because it was less 
regimented than other homeless shelters. "There was love and togetherness 
here," said Walter Watson. "We had fun with the music and games. Nobody knew 
each other, but we just loved one another." 
</P>
<P>
The Planet's creator, Clyde Casey, signed the lease for the property last April 
to "feed the imagination" of Los Angeles homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
But recently hard times hit the Planet. As donations dwindled, Casey could not 
meet the $350 monthly lease payments, forcing him to give up the Planet's two 
portable toilets. The owner served Casey with an eviction notice two months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The facility carried no insurance, Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here there was laughter. It is so necessary for us here; laughter is the best 
medicine," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
He sobbed as he surveyed the ruins Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he was not optimistic that he would soon find another site, but 
promised that "another Planet will rise from the ashes."

HUNDREDS FORCED OUTSIDE OF CROWDED WELFARE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the third straight day, hundreds of people were forced to wait for hours 
Wednesday in the parking lot of the county's Southwest District welfare office 
after Fire Department officials cited the office for allowing too many people 
into its waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people stood in lines as security guards and workers with 
bullhorns attempted to keep order. Nevertheless, groups of anxious people 
pressing up against the Athens office's front door created what one social 
services worker called "chaos just about as bad as it gets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sleeps Outdoors 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Stevenson, a 29-year-old homeless woman who had been in line every day 
this week, said she spent Tuesday night under a bush a few blocks from the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people here (Wednesday) before daylight," she said. "It looks like 
I'll be back tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Returning for a second day at the facility on Imperial Highway near Normandie 
Avenue was Rebecca, 29, who asked that her last name not be used. A mother of 
two from Inglewood, she went to the office to find out why her $663-a-month 
assistance had been cut off. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't bend my legs at the end of the day yesterday. . . . It's really 
demeaning to go through this, to have to wait in the parking lot, but I have to 
do it for my family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry and Tired 
</P>
<P>
Other angry and tired people said they had been at the facility every day since 
Monday when the county Fire Department conducted its inspection of the county 
Department of Public Social Services office and ordered that no more than 133 
people be allowed inside at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"They are treating people like cattle," grumbled Chris Cole of Hawthorne, who 
made it into the facility Wednesday afternoon after about six hours of waiting. 
"There is no organization. These people live stressful lives already, and this 
makes it a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest District office, which Fire Department officials have warned 
about overcrowding in the past, is one of the county's largest and busiest 
welfare facilities, with a caseload of 28,000 from the South Bay and Westside, 
said Colleen Moskal, a spokeswoman for the social services department. It 
combines in one waiting room those seeking county General Relief funds, food 
stamps and medical assistance with those seeking Aid for Families With 
Dependent Children. 
</P>
<P>
Like all of the county's welfare offices, it is busiest early in the month, she 
said, partly because welfare checks are issued then. 
</P>
<P>
Rising numbers of clients have created a strain on the waiting rooms of several 
of the county's 31 welfare offices during the beginning-of-the-month rush, 
Moskal said. The county's overall caseload grew by 15% last year, she said, and 
the number of clients grew 0.5% between April and May of this year, from 
910,747 to 915,450. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skid Row Office Cited 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department cited the department's Civic Center office on Skid Row 
earlier this year, and county officials say the Rancho Park office in West Los 
Angeles suffered severe overcrowding until waiting rooms were expanded last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando has threatened to close the Maclay Avenue facility there, although 
its authority to do so is unclear. In response to neighborhood complaints that 
the homeless are loitering at that facility, Supervisor Mike Antonovich has 
asked the county social services department to step up its search for a new 
facility in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
An advocate for the poor said the conditions at the Southwest District office 
illustrate the county's attitude toward the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's symptomatic of a much larger question," said Gary Blasi, director of the 
Homeless Project at the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. "The county Board 
of Supervisors has essentially adopted a policy where they don't care about 
people applying for public assistance. If you compare these waits with waits 
for real estate developers at the Hall of Records, you see the priorities of 
the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Foundation and Los Angeles have teamed up in a lawsuit against 
the county challenging the county's administration of the General Relief 
program on behalf of the homeless mentally ill.

COUNCIL ORDERS REFORMS BY CITY TREASURER; 
</P>
<P>
PROCEDURES TIGHTENED BUT NO OUTSIDE AUDIT PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of dramatic revelations about practices in the city treasurer's 
office, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday adopted a series of reforms 
to tighten procedures and increase oversight of the office responsible for 
investing $2 billion of the taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
The council, after disclosures last month about a treasurer's office attempt to 
cover up the circumstances under which a bank that paid Mayor Tom Bradley as an 
adviser got $2 million in city deposits, ordered Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg 
to establish clear, written procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special council committee overseeing the city attorney's 
investigation into possible conflicts of interest in the mayor's financial 
dealings was told it had no authority to hire an outside prosecutor for the 
inquiry. Deputy City Atty. Anthony Alperin and Chief Legislative Analyst 
William McCarley on Wednesday told the Ad Hoc Committee on Governmental Ethics 
that the City Charter bars the council from hiring outside counsel without the 
city attorney's permission and puts most disciplinary duties solely with the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn has said he would not approve hiring a special 
counsel. Faced with limited alternatives, the council committee decided to 
proceed with a proposal to hire consultants to review Hahn's work when his 
investigation is completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
As for the treasurer's office, the council moved quickly to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
Complaining that the treasurer's office has "been making up the rules as they 
went along," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the office's practice of having 
unwritten policies and not following them "is a formula for corruption." The 
council voted to have the city administrative office oversee the treasurer's 
office for the next six months. But it stopped short of bringing in a private 
auditor as proposed shortly after four days of dramatic hearings revealed 
details about a "whited-out" reference to the mayor and rigged "bid sheets" for 
the deposits in March that went to Far East National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Reforms 
</P>
<P>
Among the reforms ordered by the council are: 
</P>
<P>
* Detailed procedures for the treasurer for taking competitive bids and 
awarding deposits; 
</P>
<P>
* Submission of detailed policies, subject to council approval, for 
minority-owned businesses; 
</P>
<P>
* City administrative office review of all investments for at least six months 
to ensure that procedures are being strictly followed. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the city administrative office would act as the "eyes and 
ears" of the council during the six-month monitoring period. "We want somebody 
who will see that things we are asking you to do get done," Yaroslavsky told 
Rittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect on Investments 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg responded that, while he agreed in spirit with the reforms, he 
worried that too much oversight and overly strict regulation could diminish the 
increasing returns he has been earning on the city's huge investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what eyes and ears will do except slow us down," Rittenberg said. 
"The performance of the treasurer's office has improved dramatically since 
February. . . . The more eyes and ears we have is going to limit that." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky shot back: "It would have been a good idea to have somebody in 
there last March 22 to slow you down a bit." That was the date Rittenberg 
ordered the $2 million deposited in Far East after getting an inquiry from 
Bradley. The treasurer's office then attempted to cover up the fact that no 
competitive bids were taken. 
</P>
<P>
'We wouldn't be sitting here today" if that incident had not occurred, 
Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was paid $18,000 as an adviser to Far East during all of 1988. He has 
said he did not realize during that time that the bank did business with the 
city and learned about it only in March of this year, when bank Chairman Henry 
Hwang called him. The mayor has said that his March 22 inquiry to Rittenberg 
was to determine whether the city had a relationship with the bank and was not 
meant to pressure Rittenberg. Bradley returned the advisory fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommendations on Hold 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the city Personnel Department told the council that it will 
delay making any recommendations on disciplinary actions for the treasurer's 
office staff until the city attorney and the Police Department complete their 
investigations into Bradley's possible conflicts of interest in this and other 
financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
In the council hearing last month, it was revealed that someone on the 
treasurer's staff attempted to cover up with correction ink a notation on the 
deposit in Far East that read "per the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
After a critical report by the city administrative office was released before 
the hearings last month, the mayor asked the Personnel Department to recommend 
any disciplinary actions it deemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
John Driscoll, general manager of the city Personnel Department, said Wednesday 
that the outcome of the investigations could "influence dramatically any 
recommendation we make" on how to discipline the treasurer's office staff. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores argued that there is already sufficient evidence 
of problems in the treasurer's office and in Rittenberg's management to justify 
some personnel changes. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority of the council appeared to favor leaving things as they are 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Outside Audit 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Councilman Richard Alatorre had recommended hiring a private 
accounting firm to oversee the treasurer's office. But council members Nate 
Holden and Gloria Molina objected to that as a waste of taxpayer money and an 
abdication of the city's responsibility to police its own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrative Officer Keith B. Comrie said that his office could conduct 
the routine auditing but noted that there might be "higher public confidence 
in" an outside firm. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour debate, the council agreed to leave the matter in the city 
administrative officer's hands for now. Only Councilman Ernani Bernardi 
dissented in the 11-1 vote on this and other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The investment guidelines require that all bids be recorded in writing and 
time-stamped before deposits are made, that at least three bids be taken, that 
equal treatment be given in selecting banks that are invited to bid on city 
funds and that the eligibility of banks to receive city funds be reviewed 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the council ordered the treasurer to prepare a study on the 
benefits and drawbacks of competitive bidding versus negotiated bidding for 
deposits and to recommend appropriate changes.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEARCH RESUMES FOR MISSING PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Civil Air Patrol resumed its search Wednesday for two men aboard a 
single-engine plane that disappeared while on a flight from Southern California 
to the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
The missing pilot, Redwanj Abouhamed of Hawthorne flew out of Compton Airport 
sometime Sunday morning in a Piper Cherokee and was supposed to land in Big 
Bear or Mammoth within several hours, said Federal Aviation Administration 
spokeswoman Elly Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
Abouhamed, who did not file a flight plan, also apparently stopped at Hawthorne 
Airport to pick up an acquaintance, John Lazar of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The air patrol's search effort was grounded Tuesday by low clouds and 
thunderstorms. By Wednesday, the patrol resumed its search with 19 aircraft 
flying over the Sierra at the 11,000-foot level looking for signs of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a dozen CAP search planes from a base in Madera covered about 3,000 
miles along a corridor between Fresno and Mammoth. The search began Sunday 
afternoon after Abouhamed's wife telephoned the FAA to report that her husband 
had not landed as planned in one of the mountain resorts.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG UNIT ARRESTS MURDER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected gang member has been arrested by Los Angeles police for allegedly 
gunning down a West Los Angeles man in Pacific Palisades early July 29. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang unit, Community 
Resources Against Street Hoodlums, arrested Ruben Rodriguez, 24, shortly after 
5 a.m. at a relative's apartment in Mar Vista Gardens, Detective Bill Humphry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Humphry said Efigenio Vital, 20, was shot and killed on Asilomar Boulevard in 
the seaside community after an argument with Rodriguez and other gang members 
at a party July 29. Police say Vital was an associate of a rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
Vital and several friends apparently drove to a cul-de-sac at the end of 
Asilomar Boulevard above Pacific Coast Highway to enjoy the ocean view after 
the party and another car carrying Rodriguez arrived later. The occupants 
called out the name of a gang, then fired several shots, fatally wounding 
Vital, Humphry said.

<P>
Los Angeles Fire Capt. Donald Stukey and Firefighter Jeffrey Dapper have been 
awarded departmental commendations for rescuing a man who was threatening to 
commit suicide last October. 
</P>
<P>
Stukey and Dapper found the man -- incoherent and semiconscious -- at Florence 
Avenue and Main Street atop a 50-foot power pole, trapped between high-voltage 
wires, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters carefully positioned their ladder and removed the man from the 
pole, saving his life, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Stukey's and Dapper's "performance under dangerous conditions showed

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRED DEPUTY WILL GET HIS JOB BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Civil Service Commission found Wednesday that a former sheriff's deputy who 
was fired for taking part in horseplay and pranks at the Pitchess Honor Ranch 
in Castaic should be reinstated because he was singled out for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing officer Karen Orren found that former deputy Brent P. Talmo was treated 
more harshly than other deputies who engaged in similar acts. 
</P>
<P>
Talmo was fired three years ago after completing his probationary period. 
</P>
<P>
Orren's recommendation that Talmo be given a 90-day suspension for three 
separate incidents was adopted by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Talmo and other deputies at the honor ranch were accused of taking part in a 
series of pranks among themselves and inmates, including putting a dead gopher 
in an inmate's pocket and carrying out so-called "search and destroy" missions 
in inmates' barracks, damaging the inmates' and county property.

SUIT DEMANDS U.S. HALT ITS PHONE TAPS OF EIGHT ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Civil rights attorneys filed suit Wednesday demanding that the federal 
government cease tapping telephone conversations between eight Los Angeles-area 
aliens arrested on subversion charges and their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses the FBI, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh and the Executive Office for Immigration Review 
of interfering with the privileged communications between the attorneys and 
their clients -- seven Palestinians and a Kenyan -- arrested in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
None of the eight aliens -- originally accused of belonging to a Marxist 
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- have been charged with 
criminal activity. Some still could be deported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unrelated Cases 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the American Civil Liberties Union's office in Los 
Angeles, ACLU Executive Director Ramona Ripston expressed fears that government 
officials have tapped telephone conversations in her office involving unrelated 
cases as well. She estimated that 200 pending ACLU court cases could be 
jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
"The government admitted wiretapping these plaintiffs and overhearing 
conversations between these plaintiffs and their lawyers," Ripston said of the 
aliens' cases. "We here in the ACLU are enormously concerned that our 
telephones may have been tapped." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the electronic surveillance surfaced in March in court documents 
related to immigration proceedings against the so-called "Los Angeles 8." In 
the documents, U.S. Department of Justice Counsel Michael Lindemann noted that 
a single conversation was overheard in the case against the aliens. 
</P>
<P>
In connection with this, Lindemann has told Immigration Judge Ingrid Hrycenko, 
who has been conducting the deportation proceedings against the aliens, that he 
and his co-counsels have not been given the surveillance tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials in Washington, where the suit was filed in federal 
court, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unanswered Questions 
</P>
<P>
Peter Shey of the National Center for Immigrant Rights said that, while 
Lindemann insisted the conversation did not involve attorney-client privilege, 
"the government has not stated who made that determination, the standards used 
to make that determination, or when that determination was made." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shey said, "despite our inquiries to the government, they have 
refused to confirm or deny that communications between attorneys and clients at 
this time are no longer the subject of surveillance." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials contend that electronic surveillance is authorized by the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act when individuals are believed to have 
engaged in criminal acts deemed a threat to national security. 
</P>
<P>
But the aliens' attorneys insist that the surveillance is illegal because their 
clients have never been employed by a foreign power, or committed any illegal 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Center for Immigrant Rights Inc. of Los Angeles filed a 
separate claim with the U.S. attorney general's office in Washington seeking 
$250,000 for seven plaintiffs whose right to privacy and freedom of expression 
were allegedly violated by the surveillance, Shey said. 
</P>
<P>
The basis of the government's subversion charges against the aliens, who were 
accused of being national security risks, was the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, 
which subjects them to deportation. Since 1987, the INS has dropped noncriminal 
charges against six of the eight, accusing the six of visa violations. Still 
accused of subversion are Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles and Michel 
Shehadeh, 33, of Long Beach.

20 ARRESTED AT AIDS DRUG VIGIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR F. ZONANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty AIDS activists were arrested for trespassing at a vigil and hunger 
strike outside the Federal Building at the Los Angeles Civic Center on 
Wednesday night, dramatizing their demand for widespread distribution of the 
experimental antiviral drug DDI. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out for me and tens of thousands of men, women and children 
for whom AZT is no longer an option," said AIDS patient Wayne Karr, who vowed 
to consume only juice, water and protein powder until DDI is made widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials ordered Karr and other members of the newly formed Coalition 
for Compassion arrested after the protesters refused orders to vacate the North 
Los Angeles Street sidewalk, where the activists had originally planned to 
spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
Chanting "No More Needless Deaths" and "Release the Drugs Now," the protesters 
were led away by Los Angeles police officers. Some went limp and had to be 
carried. There was no violence. 
</P>
<P>
The arrestees were booked for investigation of trespassing and released on 
their own recognizance, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor supports their efforts (to win access to promising drugs), but the 
laws of the city must be upheld and will be upheld," said Bill Chandler, press 
secretary to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists in San Francisco have been encamped in six tents for nearly four 
years in a similar vigil outside a federal office building. Mayor Art Agnos 
intervened to protect the vigil two months ago after an occupant in a nearby 
office building filed a complaint with police. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles vigil was spurred by a new federal initiative to make 
experimental AIDS drugs available on a so-called "parallel track" even as they 
continued to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
In the first major test of the new concept, researchers, regulators, doctors, 
patient advocates and the drug's manufacturer have been meeting in Washington 
to hammer out details of a compassionate use program to provide DDI to patients 
who become resistant to or cannot tolerate AZT, the only federally approved 
antiviral for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol-Myers, which makes the drug, has pledged to make DDI available to 
patients "for whom the drug is critical" beginning next month. But 
demonstrators such as Randy Wendelin said they are afraid that "if we don't 
keep the pressure up, the program will be extremely limited." Wendelin, Los 
Angeles City AIDS Coordinator Dave Johnson and others are fasting for 24 hours 
in sympathy with Karr. 
</P>
<P>
AZT is so toxic that up to 50% of AIDS patients cannot tolerate full doses of 
the drug. And many patients develop resistance to the drug after 12 to 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dr. Neil Schram, a Harbor City physician who attended a meeting in 
Washington on Tuesday to develop plans for DDI distribution, said Bristol-Myers 
plans to give the drug to up to 5,000 people under the compassionate use 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Another 1,800 AIDS and AIDS-Related Condition patients will be entered into 
formal clinical trials; of these, half will receive DDI and half will get AZT. 
Both programs are expected to begin in September. 
</P>
<P>
Schram said the hunger strikers are misguided. "There really is no enemy here," 
he said. "The Food and Drug Administration wants this to happen, the National 
Institutes of Health wants this to happen, and Bristol wants it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"What has to happen next is for the parties to agree to a definition on 
AZT-intolerant and AZT-resistant," Schram added. "I hope those definitions are 
not overly restrictive." 
</P>
<P>
Schram said the clamor for DDI may be premature, at least for patients for whom 
AZT continues to be effective. At this point, he said, "nobody knows whether 
DDI is less good, as good or better than AZT."

BULK-LOADER DEAL WITH KAISER OKD BY PORT PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial plan for the Port of Los Angeles to pay one of its major 
tenants up to $6 million for coal exporting equipment -- at a 10% profit for 
the tenant -- was approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles Board of Harbor 
Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 3 to 2 to approve the deal between the port and Kaiser 
International Corp., which is buying a coal bulk loader from the Port of 
Portland, Ore., for the express purpose of selling it to the Los Angeles Harbor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contended that it would have been cheaper for the port to purchase the 
equipment directly from the Portland facility and bypass Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
They complained that Kaiser, which already runs the port's coal-exporting 
operation, will earn a "middleman profit" from the contract -- which was not 
put out to competitive bid. They also said that Kaiser could achieve an unfair 
advantage over its competitors if the port should expand its bulk-loading 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The harshest critic of the arrangement is Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's highly irregular," Flores said. "It certainly gives all the 
appearance of being a deal put together to benefit Kaiser. . . . If the port 
wants (the bulk loader), they should buy it directly." 
</P>
<P>
Both port officials and Kaiser President Richard Holdaway have denied Flores' 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's approval came one month after the plan failed to pass because 
of a tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Robert Rados, who was absent from last month's meeting, cast the 
swing vote Wednesday, saying he thinks the port needs the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners who voted against the contract -- Jun Mori and Ronald Lushing 
-- said they did so only because the port is buying the equipment for a project 
that has not yet received commission approval.

SOME POMONA PROJECTS TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE 
</P>

<P>
Developers of city-assisted redevelopment projects will be required to pay 
workers prevailing wages or face fines under a new policy adopted this week by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, proposed by Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, passed 3 to 2 after 
a spate of verbal attacks and accusations were traded among council members. 
Bryant and council members Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua voted in favor, and Mayor 
Donna Smith and Councilman Mark Nymeyer were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing wage refers to the average pay for a particular skill performed 
in a certain locality. It is calculated periodically by the state labor 
commissioner's office. Pomona is the fifth city in Los Angeles County to 
prohibit substandard wages for construction work subsidized by a redevelopment 
agency, Deputy City Atty. William Curley said. Monterey Park, Baldwin Park, 
Santa Monica and Los Angeles are covered by prevailing wage laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Limits 
</P>
<P>
Only developers who receive Redevelopment Agency assistance are affected by the 
policy. Additionally, the policy would be limited to residential projects of 
more than $250,000 and non-residential projects of more than $100,000. It 
imposes a $25 fine on developers, contractors and subcontractors for each day 
they are found to be in violation of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so we can get citizens out of living at the poverty level," Soto said 
before the council voted. "I have nothing against big business. We need 
development in this town. (But) if someone wants to come into Pomona they're 
going to come in with prevailing wages whether they like it or not." Soto's 
comments were applauded by about 10 people at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said the prevailing-wage rate would only drive developers across the 
county line at a time the city is struggling to attract businesses. She added 
that she was skeptical of the fact that only four other cities in Los Angeles 
County have similar policies, and that only Monterey Park's is almost identical 
to Pomona's. The mayor also accused Soto, Ursua and Bryant of bowing to union 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Muscled' by Unions 
</P>
<P>
"If this is such a good thing for Pomona, why aren't other cities jumping on 
the bandwagon?" Smith said. "I have nothing against unions -- my father was in 
a union -- (but) I've had several meetings with union members and I'm tired of 
being muscled by them." 
</P>
<P>
Soto, in turn, leveled her own attacks against Nymeyer, who earlier had said it 
was none of the city's business to monitor contractors' payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Nymeyer is still campaigning," Soto responded, pointing to a cable 
television camera in the back of the council chambers. "This will not be held 
as a campaigning forum for grandstanding." 
</P>
<P>
The state Labor Code and the federal Community Development Block Grant program 
already require prevailing wages for work directly funded by city agencies. But 
the laws do not cover projects assisted by redevelopment agencies in other 
ways, through such means as condemnation and acquisition of property, off-site 
improvements or preferential treatment in land sales. 
</P>
<P>
Most large developers in Pomona already offer prevailing wages because they 
contract with unions for construction work, Curley said. Although the 
resolution takes effect immediately, projects already in the construction phase 
will be exempt from the policy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions Monday night, the council: 
</P>
<P>
Voted 5 to 0 to appoint Bryant as Pomona's representative on the San Gabriel 
Valley Mosquito Abatement District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Voted 3 to 2 to create a Board of Parking Place Commissioners to oversee all 
vehicle parking districts, with Smith and Nymeyer dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
Postponed adoption of developer fees for road and highway improvements, public 
safety projects, and traffic signal and control devices. 
</P>
<P>
Voted 5 to 0 to endorse the 1988 South Coast Air Quality Management District 
plan for improving regional air quality.

CONSIDER MOVING SITE OF MOTOCROSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent Azusa Planning Committee meeting was asked to consider public 
nuisance charges against the Eagles Lodge motocross, which included noise, 
pollution and sanitation violations. In defense of the (motocross), a former 
mayor of Azusa implied that because the neighbors are of the 
"Johnny-come-lately" variety, they had no right to complain. This from a person 
one would expect to head a welcoming committee for new citizens. 
</P>
<P>
First there was a denial of violations of time limitations. When such 
violations were proven, the (motocross advocates) claimed they were unaware of 
their existence. They claimed the operation is for the benefit of children to 
keep them out of trouble with drugs, alcohol, etc. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest there are religious groups who would be happy to provide a copy of 
the Ten Commandments, which would teach them to tell the truth and respect 
their neighbor. With respect to noise, I would like to have someone tell me of 
a sport (hockey, football, baseball, basketball) that requires play-by-play 
description over an excessively loud P.A. system for spectators who are able to 
see the action. Certainly neighbors within a quarter-mile radius have no 
interest in race results. 
</P>
<P>
A suggestion with which I heartily agree was to study the possibility of having 
the events removed to a rural area, which is what this area was when permission 
was first granted.

TRASH FEE INCREASE OKD

<P>
Trash-collection fees for residents will go up 8.6% following the City 
Council's decision to approve a rate increase requested by Covina Disposal Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company said an increase was necessary because of higher fees it must pay 
the Los Angeles County Sanitation District Landfill and the BKK Landfill. In 
its request to the city, the company said it needed an increase to cover $4,800 
in additional costs, including landfill fees and a 6% franchise fee. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, the monthly refuse-collection fee for single-family 
residences will increase from $8 to $8.69. The fee for multiple-family 
customers such as apartment buildings will go up from $5.71 to $6.20 per 
dwelling unit.

LANDSCAPE FEES TRIMMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a special meeting, the City Council on Monday reduced the fees it charges 
residents of two hillside neighborhoods for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners had criticized the fees as excessive and unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
In May, resident Frank Barbagallo criticized city-administered maintenance 
districts for spending $396,000 without ensuring that his hillside neighborhood 
is landscaped and brush is removed from the "natural areas." 
</P>
<P>
The maintenance districts, established over the past 20 years in five of the 
city's newer subdivisions, were established to require developers to provide 
greenery, which the city subsequently maintains. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners, led by Barbagallo, also protested the city's use of interest from 
the district's funds for other city departments. The city had previously 
pledged to return interest funds to the district coffers. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the council reduced the emergency funds that the residents had 
criticized as excessive by reducing the assessment fees for next year. For each 
of the 240 homeowners in District 6, the $380 fee proposed by city staff was 
reduced to $280. That will decrease the $250,000 contingency fund by about 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
In District 7, the council reduced the staff proposal from $550 to $500 for the 
400 homeowners, and from $250 to $200 for undeveloped properties. 
</P>
<P>
The council also promised to form an advisory committee of homeowners to work 
with city staff on future assessment levels, the size of the contingency funds 
and the fate of the as yet undetermined amount of interest income that the city 
spent outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
Although Barbagallo said he was generally pleased with the council's actions, 
he said the homeowners are waiting to see if the city follows through on its 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper, it is perhaps one of the biggest victories we have achieved," he 
said. "There were a lot of promises made, and now we have to see if they follow 
through."

TRANSIT RULING REAFFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A July ruling allowing the Foothill Transit Zone to assume bus routes in the 
San Gabriel Valley has been reaffirmed by a Superior Court judge, who last week 
denied a request by two Southern California Rapid Transit District unions to 
reconsider his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow ruled that Foothill Transit, a 
partnership of 20 area cities and the county that contracts with private bus 
companies to provide service, was legal. Unions representing 7,000 RTD drivers 
and mechanics challenged the transit zone's creation, arguing that it 
threatened union jobs and was an illegal breakup of the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill was approved by the county Transportation Commission, which oversees 
county transportation policy, in late 1987 as a low-cost alternative to the 
RTD. Since December, it has operated service on two express routes from Diamond 
Bar and Glendora to downtown Los Angeles, featuring lower fares than the RTD 
and reporting increased ridership. 
</P>
<P>
The unions have said they will appeal, said William P. Forsythe, Foothill 
Transit's executive director. Barring a setback in the higher court before Aug. 
11, Foothill will continue expansion plans for six RTD local service lines by 
mid-September, Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative start-up dates for the new routes are: Aug. 21, Line 178, 
providing service east from El Monte to Cal Poly Pomona; Aug. 28, Line 185, 
from Hacienda Heights through West Covina to Montclair; Lines 274 and 276, from 
Basset and La Puente to Glendora; Sept. 11, Line 280, from Azusa to Industry 
along Azusa Avenue, and Sept. 25, Line 187, from Pasadena to Pomona through the 
Foothills area.

MONTEREY PARK APPROVES HOTEL SITE DEAL 
</P>

<P>
Despite continued opposition by some residents, the City Council has approved 
paying $4 million for a seven-acre site at the Los Angeles Corporate Center, 
where a 225-room Embassy Suites Hotel would be developed. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel project, approved by a 4-1 vote Monday, could result in the city's 
gaining $750,000 in revenues and taxes annually, city officials say. Beyond 
that, City Manager Mark Lewis said the hotel would be a considerable boost to 
the overall economy of the community, which still faces budget problems and 
gets low revenue from sales taxes compared with surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed six-story hotel, billed by city officials as a first-class 
business hotel, would overlook a residential neighborhood next to the corporate 
center on the city's western edge along the Long Beach Freeway. It represents 
the largest and most complicated deal undertaken by the city's Redevelopment 
Agency, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action authorized an agreement between the Los Angeles Corporate 
Center and the city. Under the plan, the city will pay $4 million to the Los 
Angeles Corporate Center for the land where the hotel would be built. In turn, 
as an enticement for the hotel developer, the city will sell the land for $2.5 
million to GR Development and Robert E. Woolley Inc. The city would lose $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But within two to three years, Lewis said, the city will make that back in room 
taxes and sales taxes from the hotel, which is scheduled to have 6,500 square 
feet of banquet space and meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an excellent deal for us," Lewis said. "Hotels of this nature are very 
hard to get, so it's real feather in the city's cap to get a hotel of this 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
But some residents criticized the plan. "How would you like a hotel in your 
back yard?" Cindy Yee asked. "You don't see Pasadena, San Marino, Glendale or 
Beverly Hills slam-dunking a hotel in a neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
She said the city was essentially subsidizing the developer. "If you and I 
bought a home, would the city help us make a down payment because they would 
make it up later on property taxes? And what happens if the hotel fails?" 
</P>
<P>
Yee and others questioned the hotel development and its connection to an action 
the council took earlier this year when the city sold land on the west side of 
the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
That property was sold for $3.5 million to Los Angeles County, which plans a 
court building for abused and neglected children. The city for several years 
had tried to market the land as a hotel site. Then officials devised plans for 
a hotel at the corporate center. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Judy Chu defended the proposal, saying officials considered the 
neighbors' concerns. But she said studies show a need for a hotel, and it would 
lessen the city's money problems.

Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, who cast the lone vote against the 
proposal, said he agreed that the city needs a hotel but questions this 
project. "This deal is being broken up into little chunks. The only responsible 
way to do this is to get the whole picture, the whole outline of the deal."

EXPANSION OF LANDFILL IN AZUSA ENDORSED 
</P>

Reversing its earlier recommendation, the staff of the state Water Resources 
Control Board has endorsed an expansion of an Azusa landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion is opposed by San Gabriel Valley water officials. 
</P>
<P>
In a 22-page report released Tuesday, the staff concluded that a new 
ground-water protection system proposed for the landfill "will ensure adequate 
separation between the waste and underlying ground water." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water 
District, said the recommendation is a major setback for water officials who 
have fought against continued operation of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said that water officials will attend the state water board meeting in 
Sacramento on Aug. 17 to oppose the plan for the Azusa Land Reclamation Co. 
landfill but that the recommendation will be difficult to overcome. "It sure 
changes the odds a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Maintained 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Azusa Land Reclamation sought unsuccessfully last week to 
persuade local water officials that their new plan -- which calls for adding a 
second plastic liner and liquid collection system under the trash disposal area 
-- would prevent seepage into underlying ground water. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the company's presentation, the San Gabriel Valley Watermaster 
board, which manages the area's ground water, voted to maintain its opposition. 
Board members argued that the dump site, which is in a gravel pit, contains 
soil so porous that the danger to ground water cannot be overcome by plastic 
liners and other protective measures. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board in November of last year 
approved a plan to shift trash disposal to a new area of the dump, extending 
the dump's life by up to 20 years. The San Gabriel Valley Watermaster appealed 
the decision to the state water board. 
</P>
<P>
The state board staff recommended in April that the regional decision be 
overturned, agreeing with the watermaster that the proposed safeguards would 
not protect ground water. However, the Azusa Land Reclamation Co. upgraded the 
plan, leading the staff this week to reverse its position.

SUPT. ROGER TEMPLE DIES; KNOWN AS UNIFYING FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Temple, popular superintendent of the Garvey School District, was 
remembered by friends and colleagues this week as a compassionate man and a 
crucial unifying force for the once-divided district. 
</P>
<P>
Temple, a San Gabriel resident who began working for the district in 1966 and 
became superintendent a year ago, died of a brain tumor Sunday. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
"He was elected by the unanimous consent of the board, and that's no small 
task," said Board President Diane Martinez, a student at the Richard Garvey 
Intermediate School 20 years ago when Temple was assistant principal there. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 36, said she doesn't remember many of the former administrators at 
her school, but Temple stood out. 
</P>
<P>
"He always had that very tranquil aura about him," she said. "He was somebody 
you (could) talk to." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that before hiring Temple, the board had split into two factions 
and wrestled over many issues. "Yet the one thing we could all get together on 
was that Roger was the best thing for the district." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jim Smith also praised Temple, adding that he will be difficult to 
replace. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not too many of his caliber," Smith said. "Roger will be a tough act 
to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes Chavez, Temple's administrative assistant, said Temple was admired for 
his fairness. "He treated everyone as an equal." 
</P>
<P>
Temple began his career in 1959 as an elementary school teacher in the Downey 
Unified School District. He joined the Garvey School District seven years 
later, beginning as a teacher in the Dewey Avenue School before moving on to 
administrative positions. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Alyce, three daughters, two stepdaughters and nine 
grandchildren; by his parents, Scott and Faith Temple of Downey; a brother, 
Walter Temple of Downey, and a sister, Marilyn Hunt of Salt Lake City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services were held Wednesday morning at the Church of Our Savior in San 
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Temple's wife has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the 
Roger W. Temple Memorial Fund. Money from the fund will be used for educational 
purposes at the former Fern Intermediate School, which the school board renamed 
the Roger W. Temple Intermediate School in July. 
</P>
<P>
Checks should be sent to the Garvey School District office at 2730 N. Delmar 
Ave., Rosemead 91770.

The Energy Department delayed efforts to stop radioactive wastes from 
contaminating ground water near its Hanford, Wash., nuclear weapons plant so 
that production could continue, a congressional study found. The report from 
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, disputed 
Energy Department assertions that the leakage of an estimated 750,000 gallons 
of toxic wastes from the plant's underground storage tanks would have little 
impact on the nearby Columbia River. The GAO said although it was learned in 
1956 that some single-walled tanks at Hanford might be leaking, those tanks 
were still being used in 1980. DOE officials said that liquids were kept below 
the leaky spots.

A group of children in Lebanon, Pa., used a playground as headquarters for a 
make-believe drug ring, selling neatly packaged bags of sugar and grass 
clippings that looked like cocaine and marijuana, police said. Authorities 
speculated that the children -- who were believed to be 12 or younger -- were 
either emulating their parents or being trained for the drug business. A tackle 
box stacked with bogus drugs and colored slips of paper detailing the group's 
transactions was turned over to police last week after two children found it in 
a tree at the dilapidated playground. Police had not interviewed any children 
in the case.

For the first time, California raisins are headed for store shelves in Japan, 
with the first shipment of about $1.5 million worth of the fruit leaving the 
Port of Oakland. The raisins are being exported by the California Dried Fruit 
Co., a consortium of 18 San Joaquin Valley companies. Nicholas Boghosian, 
president of the consortium, said the sale of bulk raisins to Japan culminates 
four years of negotiations. He said the company has also developed packaging 
and advertising to meet Japanese standards and has licensed Japanese importers 
and distributors to use the California dancing raisins logo on all packages and 
in television commercials in Japan. If raisins are a hit with Japanese 
consumers, Boghosian said he hopes that the consortium can increase shipments 
in future years.

TIGHTER OCEAN POLLUTION CONTROLS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Immediately eliminate pollution along the nation's shores or risk permanent 
danger to human and marine life, an environmental group urged the federal 
government. The Natural Resources Defense Council unveiled its program to 
address short-term health threats within five years, and maintain the long-term 
health of coastal waters within 10 years. "The trillions of gallons of waste 
dumped into coastal waters each year are dangerous to human as well as marine 
life," said Bob Adler, senior lawyer for the council. Emphasizing plumbing 
efficiency standards for buildings, the group urged "a tightening of guidelines 
for industries that practice sewage dumping. We need to immediately revise the 
limits set on the amount of pollution a factory or sewage treatment plant is 
allowed to discharge." Adler noted that at least 81 beaches -- all in the 
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast region -- have been closed so far this year because 
of health threats due to waste.

Three of nine top Contra military officers, including the rebel chief of staff, 
were granted U.S. political asylum, immigration official Perry Rivkind said in 
Miami. The officers won State Department approval for asylum two days after 
five Central American presidents agreed on a plan to demobilize the 
anti-Sandinista forces. Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as 
Comandante Franklin, led the list of officers filing asylum claims. Francisco 
(Johnny) Delgadillo, a Contra political adviser also granted asylum, conceded 
that the action could be misinterpreted by rebel troops holed up in camps on 
the Honduran border.

The leaders of three Cuban human rights organizations -- arrested earlier this 
week -- have been indicted on charges of spreading false news, the official 
newspaper Granma reported in Havana. It said they "carried out a campaign of 
slander through statements to U.S. television and the anti-Cuban radio . . . 
with the aim of discrediting the action of Cuban courts during the trial 
against the Ochoa-La Guardia drug traffickers." Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez and 
Col. Antonio de la Guardia were convicted and executed last month. The three 
rights leaders are: Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission for Human 
Rights and National Reconciliation; Hiram Abi Cobas, acting head of the Human 
Rights Party of Cuba, and Hubert Jerez, president of the Jose Marti Commission 
on Human Rights.

Saying sexual orientation is important for maintaining discipline and the 
integrity of command, a federal appeals court has barred an Army Reserve 
sergeant from re-enlisting because she is a lesbian. The U.S. 7th Circuit Court 
of Appeals reversed a lower court decision allowing Miriam Ben-Shalom of 
Milwaukee to rejoin the Army Reserve. The Army had refused to allow her to 
re-enlist because of her professed homosexuality. Ben-Shalom's attorney said 
she will appeal. A district judge had earlier called the case a free-speech 
matter, but the appeals court panel wrote "it is the identity that makes her 
ineligible for military service, not the speaking of it aloud."

POLISH COMMUNISTS JOLTED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Poland's Communist rulers were jolted when a traditionally allied party said it 
will join the Solidarity movement in voting against a Communist-led government. 
The parliamentary leader of the United Peasants' Party, Alexander Bentkowski, 
said his deputies will vote against Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak when he presents a 
Cabinet to the National Assembly in two weeks. The Peasants' Party controls 16% 
of the 460 seats in Parliament. Solidarity controls 161 seats, or 35%, meaning 
that the two groups could defeat Kiszczak's efforts to form a government if 
they vote as a block. Meanwhile, Solidarity leaders in Gdansk said they will 
stage a one-hour stoppage in 470 factories Friday to protest food price boosts 
of up to 500% that the government imposed last week.

KAL DANIELS TO HAVE SURGERY ON RIGHT KNEE

Two days after learning that Kirk Gibson has been sidelined for the season 
because of a leg injury, the Dodgers announced Wednesday that his replacement, 
Kal Daniels, will undergo diagnostic arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels and infielder Lenny Harris came to the Dodgers in a July 17 trade with 
the Cincinnati Reds for Tim Leary and Mariano Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels had undergone two operations on each knee. The latest was arthroscopic 
surgery on the right knee May 16 to smooth bone spurs and remove cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels reinjured the knee after joining the Dodgers and was placed on the 
disabled list Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt a catch in his knee while running," said Dr. Ralph Gambardella of 
Daniels' latest injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in a different area of the knee, and he has continued to have symptoms. 
The knee has not responded, so we thought it was best to have a look." 
</P>
<P>
The normal recuperation from such surgery, without complications, is four to 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In 11 games with the Dodgers, Daniels hit .342 with two home runs and eight 
RBIs. STEVE SPRINGER

Mandarich, a 315-pound offensive tackle and the second overall choice in the

Mandarich's agent, Vern Sharbaugh, said he "never discussed that type of move"

ITALIAN SOCCER COMES TO AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. NATIONAL TEAM TO FACE JUVENTUS OF TURIN AT COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When AS Roma suffered perhaps the ultimate embarrassment for a soccer team from 
the powerful Italian League, losing to the United States last Saturday at a 
tournament in Northern Italy, an Italian sports daily, Gazetta dello Sport, 
called it a "sad spectacle." 
</P>
<P>
But the Romans can take comfort from the fact that they are not alone. Two 
other respected teams, America Cali of Colombia and Benefica of Portugal, were 
similarly treated in their local papers because they lost games this year to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And after the recent U.S. victory at Chicago over a leading Polish team, Ruch 
Chorzow, president of the Polish soccer federation, called from Warsaw to tell 
the players that they had disgraced the country. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that Juventus of Turin, one of the world's most successful and 
famous teams, would rather not have to play the United States? 
</P>
<P>
But that is the 22-time Italian League champion's assignment tonight at 7 in 
the Marlboro Cup at the Coliseum. A developmental team from Mexico will meet 
South Korea's national team in the second game at 9 p.m. The third-place and 
championship games are scheduled for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It is a no-win situation for Juventus. If the Italians win, that is to be 
expected. If they lose . . . well, the Italian press corps that followed the 
team to Los Angeles is prepared to report on another sad spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it would be no great surprise for the United States to win. That is 
not because the United States has emerged as a team capable of contending in 
the Italian first division. It has not, although even the Italians admit that 
it would be a respectable second-division team. Coming from the proud Italians, 
that is a concession for the Americans to savor. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States wins, it more likely will be because Juventus is not quite 
ready for its regular season, which begins Aug. 27. This trip is supposed to be 
a break from training camp, but the team still is working out twice daily at 
Torrance. The players can use the time together. Having played only two 
exhibition games, some are still introducing themselves to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Factor in jet lag -- the Italians arrived at their hotel at 3 a.m. Tuesday -- 
and the teams might not be far apart. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its storied history, which dates to 1897, there also is the possibility 
that La Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) is not as good as its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Juventus finished fourth in the Italian League last year, and although that is 
no disgrace, it was not good enough for team owner Gianni Agnelli. In a move 
that might strike even George Steinbrenner as impetuous, Agnelli offered to pay 
$65 million for the players on another Italian first division team, Sampdoria 
of Genoa, so that he could replace his own. 
</P>
<P>
That might strike some as odd considering that Sampdoria finished one place 
below Juventus in the standings last year, but Agnelli is not known for 
throwing away money. As president of Fiat, he is considered one of the four 
richest men in Italy. One of the others, Raul Gardini of the Ferruzzi Group, 
recently signed Danny Ferry to play basketball for his team in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sampdoria deal fell through, Agnelli signed three players from other 
Italian teams, including one who cost him $5 million, and recruited another 
Soviet to team with midfielder Alexander Zavarov. The first Soviet to play 
outside his country, Zavarov was a disappointment last year. But he probably 
has guaranteed himself a place on the team in the exhibition season by 
assisting on six of Juventus' eight goals. 
</P>
<P>
The player fans like to watch most, however, is Juventus' third foreigner, Rui 
Barros, a 5-foot 3-inch, 132-pound midfielder from Portugal who darts in and 
out of traffic like one of his employer's Fiats. 
</P>
<P>
Will Juventus' players take the United States seriously? 
</P>
<P>
If they watched the Americans' games from the Memorial Baretti tournament last 
weekend at St. Vincent, Italy, they will. 
</P>
<P>
Sampdoria did not. U.S. goalkeeper David Vanole of Manhattan Beach said the 
Sampdoria players were overheard before the game telling their fans that they 
would run up the score so that the reserves could play in the second half. It 
never happened. Sampdoria won, 1-0, with a goal in the 58th minute. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation game, the United States scored three goals within eight 
minutes during the second half to win, 4-3, against AS Roma, which finished 
eighth last year in the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams outside of our region don't give us a lot of respect, but that serves us 
well," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One of Gansler's challenges has been to convince his own players that they 
belong on the same field with teams such as Juventus. 
</P>
<P>
It appears as if he has done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
As a young goalkeeper, Vanole's idol was Dino Zoff. A legend in goal, Zoff was 
one of the stars for Italy when it won the 1982 World Cup. Since then, Vanole's 
nickname has been Dino. On Wednesday at the Coliseum, he finally had a chance 
to meet Zoff, who is Juventus' coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to shake hands with him," Vanole said. 
</P>
<P>
He sounded impressed. But not too impressed. "Now that that's out of the way," 
he said, "I'm going to go out and beat him."

Only a few months ago, Dave Dravecky could not lift his pitching arm without 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he culminates an extraordinary comeback from cancer by returning to the 
major leagues 10 months after having a tumor removed from his left arm. 
Dravecky will face the Cincinnati Reds at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle," said Larry Brown, a Palo Alto physical therapist who worked 
with the San Francisco Giant pitcher for four months. "He's fantastic, and he's 
got more drive than anybody I know." 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky, 33, has surprised doctors not only by the speed of his return but by 
the fact he has come back at all. Last October, Dravecky was told on the 
operating table in Ohio that he had no chance of pitching in the major leagues 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"To see him on the mound will be a miracle," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. 
"And I don't think the score matters so much." 
</P>
<P>
One of Dravecky's biggest fans, long-time friend and former San Diego Padre 
teammate Terry Kennedy, will be catching today. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the people I've met in baseball, from the very beginning, Dave is the 
one I admire most," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a daydream that he pitched the game that we clinched. Wouldn't that be 
something?"

Sixth-seeded Andres Gomez upset longtime rival Mats Wilander in straight sets 
Wednesday night in the U.S. Pro Tennis Championship delayed by rain for more 
than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, who had not defeated Wilander since 1982 and had lost six consecutive 
matches to his Swedish rival, won, 6-1, 6-4, in 1 hour 23 minutes before 8,000 
at Longwood Cricket Club. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, 29, of Ecuador, won the $50,575 first prize and his first tournament 
since he won at Palermo, Italy, last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, who trailed, 7-1, in his series against Wilander, won five consecutive 
games to win the first set in a 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2-seeded Wilander, 24, rallied late in the second set before Gomez won in 
the 10th game to nearly double his official prize earnings for the year.

CAMP GOES WAY OF LEATHER HELMET

<P>
The rite of training camp and, more important, training camp stories, will soon 
be nothing more than clip-file memories of football's lost generation. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are spending only 13 days in the dormitories of Cal State Fullerton 
this year, marking the dawn of an era, in which the concept of communal living 
becomes as extinct as the drop-kick. 
</P>
<P>
Most NFL teams have been clinging to the tradition for tradition's sake. "This 
is all kind of ritualistic," Coach John Robinson said. "It's like, 'We'll all 
go away for the weekend and we'll all get a lot closer.' Does a team become 
closer having gone through training camp?" 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, training camp and its tedium of two-a-day practices has 
become anachronistic. There was a time, in the days when players enjoyed true 
off-seasons, that six weeks of intensive training were needed to bring a team 
together. But today's players work year-round. The Rams, for instance, extended 
mini-camp through the month of May. 
</P>
<P>
The decision of the league's owners last spring to limit rosters to 80 players 
a team was but another dagger through the heart of training camp. Teams that 
once invited 100 or more players to camp now risk injuries to starters if they 
choose to practice twice daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a point of diminishing returns," Robinson said. "We're out 
there twice, but we don't have any collisions at our practices. We don't go 
100%. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty of the 80 (players) you coach, you're going to fire. Some of these 
teams that have 150, you really put in a lot of time on people who are not 
going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have signed a contract with UC Irvine to use its facilities next 
summer while construction begins on a new sports complex at the Fullerton 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
It's not inconceivable that in two years, training camp will be held at Rams 
Park in Anaheim on a regular work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the companionship lost with the abolishment of camp? The bonding of 
men? Perhaps the lack of training camp will only cut into valuable book 
material. 
</P>
<P>
"Back when I was with the Raiders, for some of those guys training camp started 
at 9 p.m. and went till 4," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Football of the future promises that players will be home for dinner every 
night, like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Green, Buford McGee and Jerry Gray missed practice Wednesday to attend a 
memorial service for Stacey Toran, the Raider safety who was killed in an 
automobile accident Saturday night. . . . Coach John Robinson said he was 
hoping holdout tight end Damone Johnson would show up in the next few days, 
although he might have been speaking more from his heart than his head. Richard 
Ashe has a leg injury, so the team has practiced this week with one healthy 
tight end, free agent Gary Knudson.

HOW BAD IS CAMPUS CRIME IN CALIFORNIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 -- At Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, Robbin Brandley, 23, was murdered 
on Jan. 18, 1986, while walking to her car in a dimly lit parking lot after 
ushering at a school concert. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At San Diego State University, there have been eight rapes and attempted 
rapes in the last two years, the most on any California State University 
campus. In 1985, Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity was banned for five years as a 
result of a rape during a party at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An 18-year-old freshman asleep in her fifth-floor dormitory room in San 
Nicholas Hall, University of California at Santa Barbara, was brutally beaten, 
gagged, blindfolded and raped in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At UCLA in 1985, a 21-year-old woman student working the night shift at the 
Guest House, a campus hotel for visiting VIPs, was assaulted by two men who 
attempted to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Urban Campuses 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley, with a student body of about 31,000 and 71 violent crimes, ranked 
No. 1 in violent crimes in 1986 among 330 campuses nationwide reporting in the 
annual FBI Uniform Crime Report. (However, reporting is not mandatory and many 
large urban campuses do not do so). In 1988, the number of violent crimes at 
Berkeley dropped to 45. 
</P>
<P>
On the University of Southern California campus, there were 3 rapes reported in 
1988, 9 robberies, 7 aggravated assaults and no homicides. The figures -- 1,412 
total crimes including 449 burglaries from motor vehicles -- reflect a marginal 
decrease from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, with 35,700 students, reported 22 violent crimes in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing on campus security at UCLA in March, 1987, members of the 
state's Little Hoover Commission, a bipartisan watchdog panel, said the nine UC 
campuses are among the most crime-ridden in the nation and must be made safer. 
Robert T. O'Neill, then the commission's executive director, said then, "In 
some people's minds, the UCs are sanctuaries. That's just not the case any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Jeannine English, who is now executive director, says the commission made 
recommendations, including establishment of a security review committee on each 
UC campus to report directly to the chancellor: "We felt that one of the 
problems with campus security was that a lot of times it was just being ignored 
in terms of budgeting and the overall emphasis the administration was placing 
on security." 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State system's 1988 report on crime at the 19 campuses in 1988 showed a 
10.9% increase from 1987 in the total number of felonies, but a 34.8% dip in 
violent crimes -- homicide, rape, robbery and assault. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the state universities nor the UC system reported any homicides in 
1988, but rapes and attempted rapes increased 20% systemwide at the Cal State 
campuses from 1987, with 18 reported. Violent crimes on UC campuses included 18 
rapes, 9 attempted rapes, 38 robberies and 70 aggravated assaults. Still, 
violent crime was down overall by 16%, the lowest since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Violent Crimes 
</P>
<P>
In the state university system, San Jose State University reported the most 
violent crimes, followed by Cal State Northridge and San Diego State. At San 
Diego, the number of violent crimes has dropped dramatically, largely, says 
John Carpenter, public safety director, as a result of a concerted, 
high-visibility effort that included officers on overtime on foot patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego campus, he points out, is the system's largest, with 36,000 
students, and "the urban area is coming closer and closer to campus. We're not 
isolated." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter says most college campuses are safer than the cities in which they 
are located, but cautions that parents can't simply "drop their children off at 
the dorms" and think their worries are over. BEVERLY BEYETTE

TRAVIS, OSLIN'S SMOOTH AND EASY OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Travis might look a little like James Dean, but when he delivers a song 
he's like Spencer Tracy at work: no apparent effort, no visible technique, just 
utter devotion to and absorption in the role. 
</P>
<P>
On stage Tuesday at the Universal Amphitheatre, Travis didn't monkey with his 
strength. He toyed with some melodies a little more than he does on record, but 
he kept it clean and simple. He flashed no eccentricities, he didn't employ any 
mannerisms or quirks as an easy signature. Travis doesn't have the flourishes 
of a Willie Nelson, but like Nelson he goes straight to the song's truth. 
</P>
<P>
That by itself doesn't explain why Travis has dominated country music for the 
past few years, but it's the cornerstone of his reign. Adherence to country's 
original musical values and an ear for good songs are other parts of it. Good 
looks don't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But the country field is full of hunks with good voices and traditional sounds. 
Travis' deep connection with his audience can probably be attributed to an 
anti-macho stance that makes him the answer to a woman's prayers. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1986 debut album drowning in remorse and self-laceration, Travis hit 
his keynote vein in his second LP, whose title could be his thematic banner: 
"Always &amp; Forever." He's the guy who's learned his lesson and wants back 
in, the man who will make that permanent commitment. 
</P>
<P>
He might be too good to be true, but at the Amphitheatre, where he was opening 
a three-night stand with new country queen K. T. Oslin as the opening act, 
Travis made it all seem real and easy. 
</P>
<P>
The risers and the music stands, with their wood paneling and the RT logo, 
enhanced the traditional, tasteful tone and gave Travis and his six musicians 
the look of a band at a lakeside lodge in the '50s. The singer's long, corny 
jokes (remember the one about the lady in the tight dress getting on the bus?) 
made him seem like one of those amiable entertainers at the early Grand Ole 
Opry. 
</P>
<P>
In image, Travis is a country anomaly: fine-featured and delicate-looking, with 
a slanting smile and liquid eyes, he looks like a grown-up Huck Finn, or a 
Saturday matinee cowboy hero, or maybe even a backwoods sprite. 
</P>
<P>
You definitely don't picture him loading logs onto the pickup or brawling in 
the roadhouse parking lot. But the grainy voice that comes out sounds as if it 
belongs to someone altogether older, huskier and more battered by life. 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing mood was upbeat as No. 1 hit followed No. 1 hit, with the 
pledges of permanence and devotion overshadowing the accounts of regret and 
revenge. Fiddles and pedal steel set the twangy tone, and Travis tempered his 
country orthodoxy with a little swing, a little jump blues and a touch of Tin 
Pan Alley. His one notable departure was a version of Brook Benton's 1959 
R&amp;B ballad hit "It's Just a Matter of Time." 
</P>
<P>
His one misstep was a final encore trilogy of "Dixie," "Battle Hymn of the 
Republic" and "All My Trials," offered before an Old Glory backdrop. It was 
like a bad dream mashing Merle Haggard together with Neil Diamond, and it 
represented a leap from the genuine and intimate to the facile and grandiose 
that even someone as gifted as Travis couldn't make. 
</P>
<P>
If Travis evokes a Spencer Tracy comparison, K. T. Oslin came on like a brassy 
Rosalind Russell, a big-voiced pop belter whose music often touches down far 
from any country motifs. Like Travis, Oslin -- whose primary strength is her 
songwriting -- goes against country stereotypes: She's not young, she's not 
petite, and she's certainly not pliant. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Oslin represents an almost frighteningly aggressive new country woman, 
ogling younger men and requesting "round the clock lovin'." Her stage persona 
was appropriately determined and defiant, and like Travis she clearly 
establishes special bonds with her audience. 
</P>

CRITIC AT LARGE: AN ANECDOTAL ENCLAVE OF VILLAGE GHOSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I went home again to Hammondsport for a few days in June, one of the 
thoughts that struck me as I led my children and some of their children on a 
walking tour of that lovely upstate New York village was that the place was an 
anthology of anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
You don't wonder that so many storytellers have come out of small towns, or out 
of ethnic enclaves within larger cities. A cynic might say that there is so 
little else to do it's natural and even inevitable to spin moments into 
anecdotes and embroider anecdotes into tales. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's probably true. Those long, slow winter afternoons around the stove 
at the gas station or at the pool tables in the rear of the barber shop, or 
around the bridge tables and over the manicures, make for the transformation of 
reality into narratives that have all the shaped impact of drama. 
</P>
<P>
Hammondsport, and I'm sure any town where at least some of the inhabitants stay 
put for a time, has a rich oral history, not all of it reliable and some of it 
communicable only among consenting adults, but taken altogether it is as 
various in tone as life itself. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood Anderson could have found his Winesburg, Ohio, in Steuben County I 
have no doubt, and Edgar Lee Masters could have populated his "Spoon River 
Anthology" in New York state quite as easily as in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
My walking tour led by the corner where an abandoned house had stood when I was 
a boy. It was a gingerbread Victorian, imposing in its prime if not quite 
magnificent enough for the Ambersons. 
</P>
<P>
You could get into it through an open window at the back and as boys we used to 
roam through it. Some of the rooms were strewn with canceled checks. On first 
sight we imagined they were valuable and we ran home with fistfuls of them. It 
was as if the family had fled, leaving paper clues as to what their lives had 
been. 
</P>
<P>
There were tales about the family, of which a child caught only glimmerings 
from adult conversations: high living, riotous parties, easy morals and then 
sudden financial collapse, the vivid celebrities gone. 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea how much if any of this was true, and how much the gossips' 
amplifications. By now I suspect even the graybeards in town can't say with any 
exactness. But the spooky house has always haunted me. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement of wandering illicitly through its rooms was shaded by feelings 
of dread, not unlike being in a cemetery at night. It was as if something had 
died. Seeing again the other week that empty corner where the house had stood, 
I realized that the death could have been of hope. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the memories are so dark. I think of the punch lines, toward which the 
many of the tales have been carefully built over the innumerable tellings. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into him right in front of the Park Inn and I said, 'George, you may be 
my father-in-law but I'm not taking any more of your guff.' I never spoke to 
him again as long as he lived. I had my pride." 
</P>
<P>
"So I just looked at him and I said, 'Homer, why don't you just take the damned 
rowboat and sail it right up your you-know-what.' " 
</P>
<P>
"And she stares down at Willard and says, 'Dearie, even if it was on the menu, 
you couldn't afford it.' " 
</P>

"So all of a sudden the tow-line snapped and that truck went shootin' ahead 
like a gee-dee rocket and the line came whistling at me so fast I figured, 'O 
Judas priest, it's goodby Howard,' but all it did was part my hair sideways." 
</P>
<P>
In the anecdotages, standoffs become victories, victimizers are turned into 
victims in the retellings and, above all, the parting shots that didn't get 
fired in the heat of the moment get fired at last. 
</P>
<P>
I've wondered what ever happened to the family in the Victorian house, as I 
wondered about many of the people who figured in the stories. It is six decades 
at least since the check-writers left town and they may all be gone to dust. 
But if they only knew it, they have earned a curious immortality in the village 
tales. It is possible, one way and another, that we all may.

SELLARS OUTLINES GOALS OF THE 1990 LOS ANGELES FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Declaring flatly that there would be "no European works at all" at the 1990 Los 
Angeles Festival, Peter Sellars said Tuesday that he hoped the three-week 
September event would prove to traditional arts patrons that the kind of work 
"previously considered the margin was, in fact, the center." 
</P>
<P>
"I would like the festival to do for this city things that none of the 
(existing) institutions in this city can do," he said. "Collective power is 
what I hope the L.A. Festival will be about." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 members of the Los Angeles arts community attended a meeting in the 
Gallery Theatre of Barnsdall Park, where Sellars outlined tentative plans for 
the Pacific-oriented festival. Questions and suggestions from audience members 
composed more than half of the hour-and-40-minute meeting. (Audience members 
demanded overtime when Sellars tried to end it after about an hour.) 
</P>
<P>
Sellars later said that he wanted to incorporate into the festival some of the 
ideas given to him by enthusiastic local artists. "Three or four (of the ideas 
presented) were really wonderful, and we will capitalize on them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars, a stage director whose "Nixon in China" will be presented at the Music 
Center during the festival, would not divulge which audience ideas festival 
planners intended to incorporate, but during the meeting he seemed especially 
interested in discussions of five subjects: providing performances for those in 
locations such as hospitals and prisons who could not get out to festival 
sites; selecting sites that would be easily accessible for the elderly and 
handicapped; incorporating readings of poetry and other works into the 
festival; including a large portion of Native American artists, and asking 
theater owners to provide free performance space for the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody (attending the meeting) was very positive," said Al Nodal, general 
manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department, who opened the meeting. "I 
expected a lot more challenges to what (Sellars) was doing -- in terms of 
specifics on how (the local artists) would be involved. But they're very loving 
to him, and understanding of what he's trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Although the festival was originally scheduled for 1989 and postponed at 
Sellars' insistence, he acknowledged that the staff is now "about a year 
behind" where he would like to be in the planning of the "logistical 
nightmare." He did not give any specifics on the size and scope of the 
festival, saying only that it would be "as large as we have money to make it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the evening's only specifics came from the festival's executive 
director, Judith Luther, who guaranteed that "a minimum of $600,000" would be 
granted in subsidies to Los Angeles artists whose work is chosen to appear in 
the festival. 
</P>
<P>
(The festival currently has close to $2 million in confirmed pledges. Sellars 
said planners want to put off specifically defining the festival for "as long 
as we can" so more exact fund-raising totals will be available.) 
</P>
<P>
Dressed casually in a black T-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes, Sellars told the 
group of artists of his plans to divide the festival into three equal parts -- 
one made up of visiting groups from Pacific nations, one encompassing a program 
of American work from throughout the country, and one representing related work 
from local artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Discounting travel money, the money will be spread evenly across those three 
sectors of the programming," Sellars said. He said that guest performers would 
be from "anywhere touching the Pacific," including Latin American nations, 
Canada, Siberia, New Guinea, Japan, Australia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Local 
artists included in the program will be those who come from ethnic backgrounds 
or disciplines similar to the visiting groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Those (local artists) that we can subsidize wholly or almost completely will 
be selected (according to) how the work fits with the international part of the 
program," Sellars said. "That stops us from saying whose work is better than 
(another's), but just that it fits more with what's being brought to town." 
</P>
<P>
Matching local and foreign performers would be seen in the same performance, or 
would perform within hours of each other on the same stage, Sellars said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the program of subsidized local artists, Sellars said, there 
will be what he called an Open Festival, to be produced in part by the city's 
Fringe Festival. The Open Festival would allow the participation of those whose 
works don't fit in the Pacific theme, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't pay for everything, but we want everybody in this city who's working 
to participate," Sellars said, adding that there may be "certain ways to slip 
money under the table," or "steer artists towards somebody that can help" them 
with expenses. In addition to traditional arts festival elements the 1990 
Festival will also incorporate a section of programming devoted to AIDS issues, 
Sellars said. 
</P>
<P>
One of his main goals, he said, is to present 75% of the work in parks and 
other outdoor venues with no admission charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We will tour the work around the city so each visits five neighborhoods," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sellars said other events will be commissioned exclusively for 
radio and for public and cable television. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars also mentioned other broad Festival plans, such as having a shuttle bus 
program which would run from site to site, setting up an educational component 
in which artists would visit Los Angeles area schools next spring, and housing 
many of the visiting artists in an Olympic-type village on the campus of 
Festival co-sponsor UCLA.

A ROCKY ROAD TO DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HUD-BACKED PROJECT: A CALIFORNIA DREAM AND NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the first 100 years or so of Robinson Ranch, from the time Orange County 
pioneer Louis A. Robinson first settled his family in the land of rugged, 
scrub-brush canyons and ridge tops with spectacular vistas that stretch to the 
ocean, little changed until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last decade, the 827 acres tucked in the foothills of the Santa Ana 
Mountains have been part of a drama that zeroes in on the perils of 
development, California style. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story of how a small, ambitious family-run company nearly went bankrupt, 
how the federal government insured the project and lost millions of dollars, 
and how one of America's wealthiest men stepped in at just the right time and 
made millions by finally turning Louis Robinson's ranch into a quiet bedroom 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it became a backdrop for the unfolding scandal at the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development when a report surfaced saying that 
the William Lyon Co., run by the Newport Beach developer that finally made 
money on the deal, was unfairly favored by a key HUD official. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 report by HUD's regional inspector general in San Francisco said the 
property was sold to Lyon even though his bid was not the best of those 
considered by HUD. It also said two Southern California developers who bid on 
the property charged that the sale was influenced by Lyon's political 
connections and his friendship with a top HUD official. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, former HUD acting assistant secretary Shirley M. Wiseman, this 
week denied the charge. Lyon has declined to comment about the Robinson Ranch 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But the problems at Robinson Ranch began long before Lyon Co. was involved. HUD 
documents obtained by The Times show a project hampered by mistakes and 
controversy from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it was a bad underwriting decision to have made (the) loan," said 
Edwin Baker, an administrator at HUD, which lost between $10 million and $12 
million on the project. "That was a dumb thing for the department to do in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when the federal government first got involved in Robinson Ranch, it 
was the largest HUD project of its kind ever undertaken, eventually reaching 
$35 million. Four years later, when HUD threw in the towel and put the property 
out to bid, the William Lyon Co. got it for $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that controversial sale, HUD files show: 
</P>
<P>
* When HUD was deciding whether to invest in the Robinson Ranch project in 
1981, its appraisers overestimated the value of the land by more than 200%, 
according to a 1985 report by the department's inspector general. The report 
said HUD inaccurately appraised the property at $17.3 million because it 
compared the ranch to more prestigious sites in Laguna Beach and San Clemente, 
instead of similarly remote canyon areas. The report said the 1981 value was 
actually about $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* The lending company that orchestrated the HUD loan guarantee -- DRG Financial 
Corp. of Washington -- was recently banned from doing business with HUD when 
Secretary Jack Kemp said that 29% of the government projects it was involved in 
defaulted. Kemp said those defaults have cost the government more than $500 
million. HUD officials have not blamed DRG for the problems at Robinson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
* In December, 1983, when the project was on the brink of default, three 
California members of Congress came to the project's defense when DRG suggested 
that the Robinson Ranch loan be increased from $35 million to $42 million to 
avoid foreclosure. HUD balked at the idea and put the property up for sale 
instead. But first, in a letter to HUD, Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) and 
then-Reps. Robert Badham (R-Newport Beach) and Jerry Patterson (D-Santa Ana) 
urged HUD to "give full and careful consideration to the refinancing proposal." 
</P>
<P>
The Lyon Co.'s green- and white-striped flags flap along Robinson Ranch Road. 
Residential communities of quiet cul-de-sacs and "Children Playing" signs have 
sprouted along the lower levels of the development. 
</P>
<P>
Up a fairly steep incline, the highest slopes are still dotted with dozens of 
bulldozers, wood frames and a sales office that overlooks an ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
Several real estate sources in Orange County estimate that the William Lyon Co. 
has received gross income of $72 million to $97 million from the roughly 400 
Robinson Ranch homes sold so far. Based on a generally accepted profit margin 
of 15%, they said the Lyon company would be expected to earn between $10.8 
million and $14.3 million on those homes. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 homes still to be built on the property, many of them the 
more luxurious models with up to 3,400 square feet, five bedrooms and 
spectacular views. The sources said profits on these homes would typically be 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Harriet A. Harris once envisioned reaping those millions for her 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson Ranch was going to bring her small, family-run company, Ridgewood 
Development Co. of Costa Mesa, into the big leagues of Orange County 
developers. Before Robinson Ranch, her company had built only a few small 
tracts in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Harris spent seven years working on the Robinson Ranch project before it went 
sour. It began in 1977, when Harris started a deal to obtain the land from the 
Robinson brothers. Three years later, the lending company, DRG, told her about 
HUD's Title X program and how it could be used to finance the construction. 
</P>
<P>
Title X was designed to provide incentives for developers to build on property 
where it would otherwise be difficult to obtain financing, in contrast to more 
typical HUD programs that are aimed at housing the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson Ranch, for example, was so remote that it had no sewers, roads or 
electricity. There was expensive construction that had to be done before the 
houses could be built, and most commercial lenders are unwilling to risk such a 
large up-front cost. 
</P>
<P>
So the government guaranteed the loan under Title X, allowing lenders to 
provide the money without risk. DRG was the lender on the Robinson Ranch 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Title X is a "Great Society" program from the Lyndon B. Johnson era, started in 
1965, that market conditions kept from becoming popular until the 1980s. 
Robinson Ranch was the first Title X program ever processed by the Santa Ana 
HUD office, and Earl G. Fields, the local manager, remembers they had to go 
through their handbooks to find out how the program worked. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, after a cost analysis of the project, HUD agreed to guarantee a loan 
of $30.2 million to develop Robinson Ranch, partly because HUD thought the 
infrastructure might be a catalyst for development of the entire Santa Ana 
Mountains area, Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
But Harris' initial euphoria over the HUD loan was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, the company learned that the cost to build a required sewage 
treatment plant would be more than double their original estimate, almost 
immediately making the project millions of dollars over budget. 
</P>
<P>
Barely 18 months into the loan, with monthly payments of up to $400,000 on the 
principal and interest, DRG sent its first warning to HUD of a possible default 
on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said HUD suggested an increase in the loan of nearly $5 million. But it 
took HUD about 18 months to approve the increase, almost as long as the 
original application for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
"In hindsight, it was a critical juncture of the loan, and I don't think the 
project ever recovered from the delay," Harris said. Frustrated, Harris blames 
HUD for the project falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned you never pick a fight with the federal government," she said. 
"It's like trying to dance with a dinosaur." 
</P>
<P>
HUD official Fields now agrees that the delay was costly to the developer. But 
he insisted: "We tried to gather information as quickly as possible, and it had 
to be routed through Washington. If they wanted more information, we had to go 
back and get it. I think all of the persons who were working on it were working 
in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
But Baker, head of HUD's single-family division in Washington, said the sewage 
problem should have been seen by HUD before it issued the loan guarantee in the 
first place. The orders for how much sewage treatment the company would have to 
provide came from a local water district. The cost was open-ended because the 
company was required to build whatever the local agency ordered, and HUD had no 
control over the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, the Washington HUD official, said the sewer cost was considered a 
"rolling cannon" that should have been a red flag to HUD analyzers. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions of HUD's 1985 inspector general's report also raise questions 
about whether the department should ever have been involved in the ranch 
project. The project would have been considered infeasible if land values were 
used that were more accurate than the inspector general's, HUD officials in 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's report said the original HUD appraisers compared 
Robinson Ranch to four other sites -- two near Laguna Niguel, one in San 
Clemente and one in San Diego County. As a result, they estimated the property 
to be worth $17 million, about $12 million more than the inspector general 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
"In our opinion, each of these four comparables were in clearly superior market 
locations than the subject site is," the report says. "The two comparables near 
Laguna Niguel and San Juan Capistrano are located near the ocean and a major 
U.S. interstate highway. In contrast, the subject site was rural, without any 
water and sewer facilities, remote from services and in a new direction of 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
In a written response in November, 1985, Fields defended the department's 
original appraisal, saying that information used by the inspector general was 
not available to his analysts at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Appraising is not a science but an opinion based on the best information 
available to the appraiser at the time. . . . The political as well as economic 
conditions can contribute to either prove the appraiser's conclusions to be 
valid or invalid," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking back, though, Fields said last week he is uncertain whether he would 
do it all over again. "I don't know if we would have under the same 
circumstances," he said. "I think it was universally believed that it was a 
good project and a good project for the area. Mrs. Harris was the victim, I 
think, of circumstances well beyond her ability to control." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after HUD approved the Robinson Ranch loan increase to $35 million, the 
department revised its rules to prohibit such large loans. 
</P>
<P>
HUD Secretary Kemp stopped the department's Title X program recently, in part 
because of the high number of defaulted projects, large losses to the 
government and reports of golf courses and expensive condominiums in some 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
In the developing HUD scandal, DRG is under investigation by a federal grant 
jury on charges it violated HUD regulations. In 1985, the firm hired former HUD 
secretary and current U.S. trade representative Carla Anderson Hills to lobby 
HUD for relief from restrictions imposed on the company because of its 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But Fields said he never saw DRG use any political influence in the Robinson 
Ranch project. And he said he was never ordered to give preferential treatment 
to DRG or Ridgewood by his superiors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also said she is not a politically active person. But she and her 
husband are active contributors to political candidates and causes, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
And her husband, Willard, was appointed by Reagan to the President's National 
Fitness Foundation in 1981. Also, when Harris' company buried a time capsule at 
its Robinson Ranch ground breaking, two of the contributions came from 
President Reagan and Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said it was she, not DRG, who solicited the support of the three members 
of Congress when her project ran into trouble. Former Rep. Badham also said he 
remembers talking about the problems with Harris, whom he also called a 
contributor and participant in his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally always prefer to see the job completed," said Badham, who left 
office this year when he decided not to seek reelection. "Unless it was a 
company that was really derelict or bad, I would like to see the project 
completed." 
</P>
<P>
Badham said he was unaware that DRG was already having trouble at HUD when he 
wrote his letter in late 1983. By the next year, HUD Inspector General Paul A. 
Adams first raised warning signals that DRG and other firms were violating 
government regulations at HUD's expense. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who is still in Congress, and Patterson, now a lawyer and the city 
attorney for Dana Point, did not return telephone calls last week. 
</P>
<P>
When Lyon bought Robinson Ranch, he proved that it was possible to turn the 
property into a lucrative development. By then, however, much of the foothills 
area was already under construction. Roads and other facilities were already in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Some Orange County real estate sources said Ridgewood Development was trying 
too much too early in that area. And HUD became a partner in their mistake. In 
addition, the housing economy turned sluggish during Ridgewood's attempt to 
develop the land, and the company was plagued with uncontrollable problems such 
as bad weather and labor strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we did the best job we possibly could have done under the 
circumstances," Fields said recently. "We used what foresight we could for a 
project that would have some influence on opening other projects in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said she has accepted the result. "There was a sea of faces, and they 
did what they could, but it wasn't enough," she said after the default. "We 
ended up being in the wrong place at the wrong time."

CHP CHIEF'S OPPOSITE NUMBER IN MEXICO VISITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alejandro Romero, commander of the Mexican highway patrol in the northern state 
of Sonora, is in Santa Ana this week trying to learn what makes the California 
Highway Patrol tick. 
</P>
<P>
Romero is one of five Mexican officers in Southern California for the first 
stage of an exchange program between the CHP and its Mexican counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Mexican and CHP officials met in San Diego and sealed the plan to send 
five officers for a week to work with CHP officers. The exchange is an 
extension of a 20-year agreement under which six CHP officers are stationed 
full time in Mexico, said CHP Capt. Charles Lynd, head of the Santa Ana CHP 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Besides giving Mexican officials a look at the modern computers, radio systems 
and new cars they lack at home, the exchange is aimed at providing CHP officers 
with a deeper understanding of the area's Latino community, Lynd said. 
</P>
<P>
The five Mexican commanders began work Monday morning at CHP headquarters in 
San Diego, Oceanside, El Centro and Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, 42, said he most wanted to study CHP hiring practices and personnel 
evaluation. Later in the week, he hopes to ride with county CHP officers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is less roadway in Orange County but many more cars than in Mexico," 
Romero said. "And the roads are a lot wider." 
</P>
<P>
Lynd said that if the visit works out, he will visit Romero in Sonora later 
this year, and lower-ranking officers will also visit Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Lynd said understanding Latino culture has become a major CHP aim.

200 AK-47 RIFLES SEIZED; 4 ALLEGED SMUGGLERS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In what authorities called one of the largest weapons seizures in county 
history, nearly 200 semiautomatic rifles and 80,000 rounds of ammunition were 
seized by federal agents in Irvine and San Diego, culminating an undercover 
investigation of a weapons-smuggling ring, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-week investigation by Operation Alliance, a task force composed of 
members from the U.S. Customs Service, Drug Enforcement Administration and 
various state and local agencies, ended with the arrests of four men who 
delivered 98 Chinese-made AK-47 assault weapons, 2 handguns and about 8,000 
rounds of ammunition to a customs agent posing as a representative of a 
drug-trafficking organization in Sinaloa, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 93 AK-47 rifles and 70,000 rounds of ammunition belonging to the 
four men were seized in Irvine, and will be used as evidence against the 
alleged exporters, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
The assault rifles had a street value of $285,000, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Significant Seizure' 
</P>
<P>
Weapons smuggling "is a very high priority for customs in general. We think 
this is a very significant seizure," Steve Trent, U.S. Customs agent-in-charge 
in San Ysidro, said Wednesday while standing in front of stacks of the weapons 
at a customs facility near the border. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the rifles were wrapped in plastic and packaged neatly in cardboard 
boxes. A small instruction manual accompanied each. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the largest weapons export seizure in San Diego County that I can 
recall," Trent said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested Tuesday were identified as Enrique Gobea-Rabago, 25, a San Diego 
used-car salesman who is a citizen of Mexico; Adam Hahn, 25, an Irvine gun 
dealer; Jose Luis Rodriguez, 27, a San Diego auto mechanic, and Mario 
Lopez-Gutierrez, 29, an unemployed resident alien living in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested at the home of Gobea-Rabago in the 3900 block of Coleman 
Avenue in San Diego. Gobea-Rabago is believed to be a leader of the 
weapons-smuggling ring in San Diego, Trent said. The later seizure of weaponry 
took place at Hahn's home in the 100 block of Streamwood in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
All four were being held Wednesday at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
San Diego on suspicion of conspiracy to illegally export firearms. If 
convicted, they could each be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $1 
million, agents said.

FESTIVAL SIZE LIMIT WOULD NOT AFFECT GAY EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed size limit on all festivals in Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana 
would not prevent the Gay Pride Festival in September but would ban any future 
event that attracting large crowds, including the Mother's Day Festival and the 
Cinco De Mayo celebration, city officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young has asked the city attorney's office to draft an 
ordinance that would prohibit events that attract more than 5,000 people to the 
87-acre park at Fairview Street and Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Any crowd that reaches above 5,000 people doesn't belong in a neighborhood 
park," Young said Wednesday. "They belong in a stadium or a facility larger 
than a park." 
</P>
<P>
Young said the long-term controversy over the gay festival prompted him to ask 
for the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"That festival made me think whether the park is an appropriate setting for 
such a large number of people," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also said the ordinance is directed against profit-making groups that 
charge fees for events held in the park. Those groups, he said, usually have 
concession stands selling beer and attract a rowdier crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation is to get beer-drinking events out of Centennial and into some 
place where they can be controlled easier," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said the city can set a limit on crowd size as long 
as the ordinance does not discriminate against any group. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, said the proposal 
reflects the pressure on the City Council from the controversy over the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if I was on the City Council, I would be scrambling as well to prevent 
this sort of controversy in the future," Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
Avery estimated that 4,000 people will attend the festival the first day, Sept. 
9, and that about 6,000 will attend on Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman John Acosta said the ban proposed by Young would be unfair to 
all the nonprofit groups that have traditionally held their festivals in the 
park. Only the gay festival, he said, should be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to hurt these other groups just because we want to stop one 
undesirable element from having their festival," Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta said he would support the proposal only if it was enacted as an 
emergency ordinance, which would take effect immediately and therefore prevent 
the gay-pride festival, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooper said an emergency ordinance can only be proposed if public peace, 
health or safety is jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen no facts to suggest that this proposal should be considered an 
emergency," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Serjio Velazquez, editor and publisher of the Spanish-language weekly 
Miniondas, which sponsors the Mother's Day Festival in May, said the newspaper 
plans to look for alternative sites and talk to city officials. The Mother's 
Day Festival, which has been held in Santa Ana for four years, attracts a crowd 
of about 45,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do it in other cities. But it has been a nice park to hold the 
festival. We don't want to change places," Velazquez said.

RUNNING: WITH OLYMPICS IN SIGHT, HER DEDICATION SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike many world-class athletes, Joan Hansen has never felt the need to commit 
seemingly endless years of her life in pursuit of glory. 
</P>
<P>
Train rigorously for years without a break? 
</P>
<P>
No way. 
</P>
<P>
Get psyched for races years in advance? 
</P>
<P>
Not hardly. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hansen, 31, and a 1984 Olympian, seems to reach her athletic potential 
in spurts. Intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have that kind of personality where I say, 'Oh my God, I've got to get 
out and train!' " Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't ever describe myself as a fanatic. I can focus well on anything I 
do . . . but I do not want that focus to become overly unhealthy or overly 
obsessive. I like to tread that fine line between obsession and hobby." 
</P>
<P>
And right now, running is once again becoming less of a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly a year off from training -- and several years removed from her 
best performances -- Hansen, a Los Alamitos resident, started again last 
October. She has dedicated herself to regaining the world-class form that 
helped her set an indoor world record in the two-mile in 1982, and make the 
Olympic team in '84. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes something pretty big to keep her motivated, but if it's the Olympics, 
Joan gets pretty excited about that," said Robert Vaughn, coach of a 
Dallas-based club who has worked on and off with Hansen for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not be easy. But if you're talented, things can happen," he said. 
"Joan's very, very talented." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Hansen, she didn't get to prove her talent when she most 
wanted, in the 1984 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Running in the women's 3,000-meters -- the race most remember only for the Mary 
Decker-Zola Budd tangle -- Hansen also suffered a fall just less than half-way 
through the race when she tripped on the heels of Portugal's Aurora Cunha. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Decker, Hansen got up and continued running. Although she was in last 
place when she got up, Hansen passed four runners and finished eighth in the 
field of 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw (Decker) go down and lay on the ground, but my main concern was to keep 
going," Hansen told Times staff writer Curt Holbreich last year. "I knew she 
was down. I hoped she would get back up. I cared about what happened. I could 
relate. But I also knew in the middle of a race, there was no way I could stop 
and help her." 
</P>
<P>
A proficient swimmer while growing up in Phoenix, Hansen didn't start running 
until her sophomore year at Arizona. Her identical twin, Joy Hansen, also grew 
up a swimmer, but joined the Wildcat cross-country team as a freshman and 
qualified for AIAW nationals in her first race. Joan decided to join her 
sister, and, the next year, walked on to the track and field team. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized training for one hour on a track every day was better than five 
hours in a pool," Joan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hansen twins, petite, blonde and blue-eyed, became a quick and well-known 
success. Joan, a six-time AIAW All-American at Arizona, and Joy, now a 
world-class triathlete, appeared on the cover of Runner's World magazine. The 
cover photo featured the two sitting on opposite shoulders of Steve Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Joan, the faster twin, qualified for U.S. national teams for five years between 
1981 and '85. In that time she traveled around the world for competition. Of 
the travel, Hansen said she will always be grateful as it gave her an 
appreciation of other countries and other life styles. 
</P>
<P>
On a 1982 trip to Bucharest, Romania, for the World University Games, Hansen 
remembers going outside of the area reserved for the athletes to find hundreds 
of people picketing the event. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked what the signs said. I was told the people wanted the games stopped. 
The people were demanding food," Hansen said. "Inside (the athletic area), we 
the athletes were entitled to as much food as we could eat. Outside people were 
starving." 
</P>
<P>
On another trip, Hansen said she remembers a group of Lebanese athletes playing 
guitar and singing happily while many of the American athletes complained about 
the unfamiliar conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked why they were so happy and they said for once they could go outside 
and train without fear of being hurt or killed," Hansen said. "In Lebanon, they 
had to train inside their homes because the fighting had gotten too violent 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said it was experiences such as these that helped shape her outlook on 
sports and life. Last year, while living in Coronado, she helped start the San 
Diego Athletes Fund, a nonprofit organization designed to raise money for San 
Diego athletes training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen also has been active in volunteering her time to children, giving 
classroom presentations aimed at encouraging development of self-worth and 
self-improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, Olympians seemed special to me," she said. "Now that I'm 
older, I realize that the negative press that some Olympians are attracting 
isn't (good for the sport). . . . I want to show that Olympians can have a 
positive influence, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Run: After finishing second the past two years, Mike McMahan of Laguna 
Beach won his first Orange 24-hour Run last weekend at Fred Kelly Stadium in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, McMahan, a philosophy professor at Saddleback College 
and UC Irvine, had taken the immediate lead in the race, one that always starts 
at 6 p.m. on a Friday and runs non-stop until 6 p.m. Saturday. But in 1987 and 
1988, McMahan faded badly around the 100-mile mark, and was passed both years 
by eventual winner Leo Marquez of Bakersfield. Marquez set the event record 
last year with 137 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, McMahan, 41, maintained his lead through the entire 24 hours, 
finishing with 132 1/4 miles, or 51/4 miles further than his previous best. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Terry, 44, of Culver City was second with 128 1/4 miles, and Marquez, 50, 
was third with 115. And Erma Hutton of Pasadena (fourth overall with 108 3/4) 
and Meg Slavin of Irvine (sixth with 104) became the first women in seven years 
to break the 100-mile mark at the Orange race. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six runners started the 100-mile run, though, according to race director 
Don Pycior, "Some hit 50 miles and said, 'OK . . . that's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights? "Well, one guy went 40 miles juggling three tennis balls," 
Pycior said. "But he was just one of those kind of guys who sign up at the last 
second." 
</P>
<P>
Forty miles of juggling? An impulse decision? 
</P>
<P>
Running Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rengel, next year's race chairman for the Bastille Day 8K in Newport 
Beach, said race organizers have decided to put together a $100,000 bonus 
package next year for any Bastille Day entrant who breaks the 8K world record. 
The race, proceeds of which benefit the United Cerebral Palsy, is hoping to 
attract a large field of world-class runners. Interested sponsors are welcomed 
to contact Rengel at any time. . . . Loeschhorn's Masters Men, a group of 
30-and-over runners, broke the men's masters relay record at the Orange 24-hour 
Run. The team of 10 compiled 221 1/4 miles, a big improvement over the former 
mark of 208 miles.

METS' CARTER GETS 4 HITS, BUT NO MORE PLAYING TIME

In one afternoon, Gary Carter rapped as many hits as he had since April 23, a 
stretch of 107 days, 46 at-bats and one knee operation. Carter singled twice 
and doubled twice in the New York Mets' 6-0 victory over the Phillies Wednesday 
for his first four-hit game since Sept. 23, 1987. And yet he earned himself no 
more playing time. Carter is still the No. 3 catcher, behind Barry Lyons and 
Mackey Sasser, and is not expected to start either of the games of today's 
twi-night doubleheader at Shea Stadium against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably not," Davey Johnson said. "Health-wise, he was better. Obviously, he 
swung the bat better, and the way he ran and moved around behind the plate 
showed physically he's getting better. But he's not 100%. Last week I think I 
said he was 70%. I'd probably have to elevate that to 80%." 
</P>
<P>
But Carter indicated he is ready and eager to reclaim his job. "If that's the 
way Davey wants to go about it, fine," Carter said. "My time is right now. So 
what if I'm 80% or 100%? I don't think I'll ever be 100%. I haven't been 100% 
in four or five years. What's the difference? I just want the opportunity to 
play. That's all I ask. After a 4-for-4 game, I'd like to think I can play 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
Carter was 11 for 95 for the season before Wednesday. He hadn't managed as many 
as two hits in a game since Sept. 22. Carter dropped a single into left field 
in the second inning, blooped a double past diving left fielder Randy Ready in 
the fifth, pulled a single into left field in the sixth and lined a somewhat 
accidental opposite-field double in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"My first three hits were to left field," Carter said. "I'm not about to change 
my philosophy (of hitting). I'm a pull hitter and that's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
Carter raised his batting average from .116 to a season-high .152. His two 
doubles were as many as he had all year. Carter also scored from second base on 
a ground-ball single by Kevin Elster. 
</P>
<P>
Carter moved past Rick Ferrell into fifth place for most games played by a 
catcher with 1,806. Jim Sundberg of the Rangers is fourth with 1,906. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," Carter said. "It's a positive feeling, coming off a 4-for-4 
game and a win that keeps us right in the thick of things."

U.S. Facilities Corp. posted net income of $605,000 for the second quarter, 
contrasted with a loss of $194,000 for the like period last year. Revenue rose 
55% to $14.9 million from $9.6 million. For the six-month period, net income 
rose to $1 million, contrasted with a net loss of $499,000 for the first half 
of 1988. Revenue increased 58% to $29 million from $18.4 million. The Costa 
Mesa-based company attributed the improved results to higher reinsurance 
premiums from its insurance subsidiary, higher fees earned by its US Benefits

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: SPIRIT OF FAIRNESS ALIVE AT BOGART'S, WHICH SAYS NO 
WAY TO 'PAY TO PLAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the many endearing qualities that Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick, 
displayed in "Casablanca" was his insistence that Sam the piano player be paid 
decently for his work. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't enough Ricks on the Southern California rock-music scene, where it 
has become common for club owners, under a system called "pay to play," to 
boost profits by soaking aspiring local rockers. Emerging bands hungry for 
exposure -- especially on the commercially oriented heavy-metal circuit -- have 
been required to ante up hundreds of dollars for the privilege of performing. 
</P>
<P>
It's heartening, and fitting, that the Long Beach rock-music club named after 
Bogey has had nothing to do with this exploitative practice. Like the crusty 
Rick of "Casablanca," Bogart's operates under the principle that fairness is a 
vital component of enlightened self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
Bogart's, in short, has done well without doing local musicians dirty. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the 300-capacity club about one mile from the Orange 
County line has been the leading nurturing ground for emerging bands on the 
local rock scene, while also presenting a broad array of touring talent and 
occasional special events that show a creative programming bent. 
</P>
<P>
David Swinson has been the in-house promoter for Bogart's since its transition 
in 1987 from a predominantly Top 40-oriented venue to an all-original showcase, 
and he deserves a good deal of the credit for helping the club live up to the 
"Casablanca" Bogart's standards of club management. Swinson, a concert promoter 
since the early 1980s, will leave Bogart's next Tuesday to start the next phase 
of his career: launching an independent record label. 
</P>
<P>
"His heart's in the right place," said Ken Phebus, booking agent for the Coach 
House who books some of the national headliners appearing at Bogart's. "His 
first consideration is the bands." 
</P>
<P>
Under the pay-to-play system, the club's profit motive is served at the expense 
of a musician's right to be paid for a performance (the system requires bands 
to pay up front for a set number of tickets to their own show; they can then 
recoup the money by reselling the tickets. But few bands have the time or 
temperament for salesmanship, and many who pay to play do so at a loss). 
</P>
<P>
At Bogart's, Swinson found a way to reconcile profits with ethics. He came up 
with his own system -- the "unlimited guest list" -- that has turned local 
music into a reliable moneymaker for Bogart's, while also fulfilling a club's 
obligation to pay musicians for their work. 
</P>
<P>
Swinson instituted the system after coming up against the same problem that has 
led Night Moves in Huntington Beach to institute a $50 pay-to-play fee for 
unproven bands: He found that some new bands, content with a guarantee of $50 
or $75, would not follow through by hustling to promote their shows by posting 
signs or spreading the word to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bogart's guest-list system, a new band has to do some advance work if it 
wants to make money -- but in no case does it have to pay the club or sell 
tickets. Instead, the band tells its friends and fans about the show and 
compiles a list of invitees who plan to come. Bogart's then admits every person 
on the list for free, paying the band $1 for each fan who walks in. The club 
turns its profit by selling drinks and food to those "guests" and to any paying 
customers who happen by without an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that this was a really fair proposition," Swinson said in a recent 
interview in his office at Bogart's, a dimly lit upstairs room where the walls 
are covered with music posters and the file cabinets are full of tapes sent by 
groups looking for bookings. "All they had to do was call friends. They didn't 
have to hit the streets with tickets and say, 'Our life depends on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some bands have made $100 or more on their first shot and quickly graduated to 
weekend bookings with guaranteed paydays. But Swinson also is interested in 
bringing back talented acts that may not have immediate drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the business because I love the music," he said. "And when I find a 
band that I think has a lot of talent and that I think can do something if they 
continue, I'm going to support that band." 
</P>
<P>
Swinson got his start in the music business in the early 1980s, when he opened 
White Slug Records, a record shop in Seal Beach. After booking bands for 
in-store promotional appearances, he branched into staging shows at area clubs, 
including Bogart's. When owner Richard Greco decided to turn the club into a 
full-time venue for original rock, he hired Swinson to handle booking and 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Swinson's approach has been refreshingly eclectic. Consider the coming week's 
schedule: reggae tonight with the Wailers, punk rock on Friday with the 
Dickies, all-local bills Saturday and Wednesday, heavy metal on Sunday, 
country-rock on Tuesday with Rosie Flores and Blue Rodeo, and alternative 
rockers Firehose and Swamp Zombies next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the month is out, Bogart's will have hosted blues acts and roots rockers 
as well. Bogart's also has frequently highlighted Southern California's 
acoustic-music talent and provided a forum for punk poets and off-kilter 
lecturer-raconteurs. 
</P>
<P>
Swinson's venture into booking the likes of Henry Rollins, Timothy Leary, John 
Waters and G. Gordon Liddy led to his new career move. He has formed Pro-Deuce 
Records with partner William Stankey, a Connecticut-based agent who books 
speakers on the lecture circuit. Swinson said the company has an agreement with 
Atlantic Records to distribute its first release, a collection called "Sound 
Bites From the Counterculture" that will feature segments from Leary, Liddy, 
Jello Biafra, Hunter Thompson, Eugene McCarthy and others. Pro-Deuce also is 
seeking a major-label distributor for musical releases -- with the nucleus of 
its roster likely to be drawn from among bands that Swinson watched emerge at 
Bogart's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking a serious roll of the dice, but it's something I need to pursue and 
advance my career," Swinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Greco foresees little change. Swinson's friend and assistant, Stephen 
Zepeda, will take over as lead booker and promoter. Zepeda has been especially 
involved in bringing along the local rock scene at Bogart's. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to keep things the way we've had them," Greco said. "(Swinson) 
worked too hard and did too well for us to change the way he set it up." The 
club owner said the only change he foresees is a slight scaling back in 
weeknight shows by national acts. 
</P>
<P>
STONES SHUT OUT: The California Angels' drive into pennant contention put 
Anaheim Stadium out of contention as the site of the Rolling Stones' Southern 
California concerts, according to Brian Murphy, president of Avalon 
Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium received close consideration early in discussions about the 
Stones' area appearances, said Murphy, whose company will serve as local 
promoter for the Stones' Oct. 21 and 22 performances at the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. But Murphy said that when it became apparent the Angels might have a 
shot at the World Series, which is played in late October, the Coliseum emerged 
as the preferred venue. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith, Anaheim Stadium's general manager, said that the Coliseum's seating 
advantage -- 72,000 for the Stones' shows, compared to 55,000 to 60,000 at 
Anaheim -- also was a factor, although Murphy said the possibility of a 
conflict with baseball's postseason play was the key to swinging the dates to 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium has not hosted a rock concert since 1987, when there were shows 
by Madonna, David Bowie and Bob Dylan with the Grateful Dead. But Smith said 
stadium officials are pitching to land a November pop date by artists he said 
he could not name. 
</P>
<P>
RHIGHTEOUS RHINO: Rhino Records, the company known for its compilations 
focusing on the pop past, has just released "The Righteous Brothers: Anthology 
1962-1974)," a retrospective that encompasses 28 songs (32 on CD) tracing the 
career of the Orange County-based duo from its origins as the Paramours through 
its hit-making period in the mid-'60s, to its 1974 reunion. 
</P>
<P>
McFOLGNER'S?: Coach House owner Gary Folgner may not yet be the Ray Kroc of the 
concert-club business, but he's getting there. Folgner, who last year added the 
1,000-seat Ventura Theatre to his holdings, recently became a partner in 
Calamity Jane's, a 300-seat club in Las Vegas, according to Ken Phebus, who 
handles bookings for Folgner. 
</P>

LIVE ACTION: Bon Jovi and Skid Row return to Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on

LATINOS REDISCOVER THEIR OWN CROONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a teen growing up in Tucson in the 1930s, Lalo Guerrero listened to his 
musical idols, Rudy Vallee, Al Jolson and Bing Crosby, and dreamed of one day 
counting himself among the ranks of top American pop singers. 
</P>
<P>
But in those days there was no room on the hit parade for a young Chicano 
crooner. So, with his traditional love ballads and, later, more politically 
oriented corridos (story ballads), Guerrero made his mark as a singing star 
among U.S. Latinos and throughout Latin America. He will perform tonight at 
South Coast Repertory in a benefit concert for the theater's Hispanic 
Playwrights Project. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really hit the mainstream of popular American music," Guerrero, 72, 
said Tuesday on the phone from his home in Palm Springs. "I'm a big fish in a 
small pond. I'd like to be a big fish in a big pond, but it didn't work out 
that way. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just very happy that I could make a living doing what I love to do." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero was taught guitar as a teen by his mother, herself a talented singer 
and player. When he was in high school, Guerrero would accompany a love struck 
buddy of his named Gilbert Ronstadt on 2 a.m. serenades of Ruthmary Copeman. 
Gilbert and Ruthmary married and became the parents of Linda Ronstadt. "I've 
known Linda since she was a baby," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, at 20, Guerrero grabbed his guitar, headed for the big city and landed 
in the midst of the Latin craze, working as a band singer in all Hollywood's 
celebrated Latin nightspots: the Mocambo, Ciros, the Trocadero, La Bamba. Such 
stars as Gregory Peck, Kirk Douglas, Clark Gable, Olivia De Haviland and Tyrone 
Power were among the clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"Since there was no television at that time, every night was Saturday night at 
those clubs," Guerrero recalled. "It was very interesting, it was very nice. I 
long for those days." 
</P>
<P>
But television, Guerrero said, effectively killed the club scene. In the 1940s 
he embarked on a recording career, first as part of the Imperial Trio and later 
on his own. His early Spanish-language hits included "Pecadora" and "Cancion 
Mexicana," which has become a standard. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero flirted with mainstream success in the early '50s when his 
English-language parody of "The Ballad of Davy Crockett," entitled "The Ballad 
of Pancho Lopez," unexpectedly zoomed to No. 3 on the national charts (sample 
line: "He could eat 12 tacos/When he was only 3"). The song's success earned 
Guerrero a meeting with Walt Disney -- and his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney people politely asked for -- and got -- their share of the 
songwriting royalties. Guerrero ended up establishing a chummy relationship 
with the company and went on to write a number of songs for some of Disney's 
Latin-flavored cartoon excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his success, however, remained in the Latino community and in Mexico 
and Latin America, where his recordings were popular. "Among our people, I 
would be as popular as Frank Sinatra is among Anglos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His 20-odd albums include ballads, children's recordings (which he described as 
a Spanish-language version of the Chipmunks) and country-flavored songs called 
rancheras. Four of his swing-flavored '40s hits, popular among the pachucos, 
were used in the musical "Zoot Suit." 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, inspired by such events as the migrant farm labor movement and the 
assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, Guerrero began writing and recording his 
politically oriented corridos. 
</P>
<P>
He would write the songs -- far cries from his Davy Crockett parody -- 
"whenever I saw injustices of any kind," Guerrero said. The songs were somber 
calls for justice; Guerrero said he stayed away from insult or vitriol. "They 
just make a point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to tackle social issues, from immigration to the dearth of Latinos 
on television, but now he treats them with humor. Willie Nelson's "Mamas Don't 
Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys" becomes, in Guerrero's hands, "Mexican 
Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Busboys." 
</P>
<P>
"It's protest in a way, but it's kind of like sugar-coating the pill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero moved from Los Angeles to Palm Springs in 1973 and embarked on 10 
years of six-nights-a-week performances at Las Casuelas restaurant. He did a 
little touring and recording, but when he cut down his performing schedule six 
years ago he found that he had been rediscovered by a young generation of 
Latinos, and he began playing at college campuses throughout the Southwest. "To 
them, I'm sort of a pioneer, back-to-the-roots thing," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
His performances are bilingual and heavy on narration, not only to accommodate 
non-Latino fans but also for the young Latinos who, several generations removed 
from Latin America, often do not speak Spanish themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I've been able to build bridges of understanding with my music 
between the Anglos and Hispanics," Guerrero said. "I've still got some pipes 
left, and I play the guitar well. I should, I guess -- after all, I've had more 
than 50 years of practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalo Guerrero sings tonight at 7:30 at South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center 
Drive in Costa Mesa, to benefit the Hispanic Playwrights Project. A reception 
begins at 6:30 p.m. Tickets are $25. Information: (714) 957-4033.

WHETHER TO BE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE IS QUESTION FOR NEW ARTS COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To be or not to be . . . private -- that was the key question Tuesday when 
about 50 local arts officials brainstormed over how to run a proposed 
countywide arts support organization meant to replace the defunct Orange County 
Arts Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, an ad hoc committee of about 12 administrators 
from the county's larger arts institutions came up with the idea for an Orange 
County Arts Council. Committee members Martin Weil, former managing director of 
Opera Pacific, and Bonnie Brittain Hall, director of development for South 
Coast Repertory Theatre, unveiled initial guidelines for the council at an open 
meeting in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose is simply to accomplish things none of us can do by ourselves," 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The highest priorities listed in the guidelines were advocacy (or lobbying), 
arts education and technical service. Guidelines were based largely on a 
state-funded study made to determine the cause of former alliance's demise in 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
No details on how such an organization might function have been agreed upon. 
Also still undecided is whether the council should be a county agency and 
supported primarily (or at least in part) by the county, or a private, 
nonprofit organization that would seek both private and governmental funding. 
The ad hoc committee estimated an initial council budget of about $200,000 
would be needed for the group to be effective. By comparison, the 14-year-old 
Orange County Arts Alliance operated during its final year on a budget of 
$15,000 provided through a California Arts Council grant. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Barrios, executive assistant to County Supervisor Don R. Roth, said 
that the supervisors have discussed support of the proposed council. "Sure," he 
said, "it is always a possibility" that the council could become a county 
agency. "Is funding available? Sure, and we've discussed options." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, supervisors in recent months have been philosophically supportive 
but economically pessimistic about the prospect of significant county aid for 
the arts. 
</P>
<P>
As Barrios cautioned, county dollars are used for a wide range of pressing 
needs. "I've got people who are homeless or who have no prenatal care. Then 
there's the arts. You have to access how the public views" requests for arts 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios, a former alliance board member, also said, "If the county is involved, 
then the county has a share of control" over who and what gets funded. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine M. Michaels, director of the Children's Museum at La Habra, made a 
vociferous plea for county support, calling Barrios' comment about funding 
competition "a line of rhetoric we've been hearing from supervisors for years." 
</P>
<P>
Erich Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
called for the county to take on the council: "I can't imagine this county not 
having such an agency, given our size and the amount of arts organizations 
here." 
</P>
<P>
There were those at Tuesday's meeting however, who preferred independence from 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to do fund raising in Orange County as a private, nonprofit 
organization, than as a government body," said Carolyn Charkey, past vice 
chairman of the board of directors of the Master Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
More open planning meetings will be held in the next few months throughout the 
county, Weil said.

OCC MUGS A TOO-CUTE 'GODSPELL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
Some musicals fit college stages better than others. "Godspell," with its 
no-holds-barred attitude, is an accommodating vehicle for young, maybe raw 
performers looking for the chance to try things out. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Schwartz's (music and lyrics) and John-Michael Tebelak's (book) 
retelling of the Gospel According to St. Matthew is carte blanche theater, a 
show where the 11th Commandment could be "Thou shalt not commit acts that are 
not outlandish." This musical welcomes mugging and just about every trick an 
actor or director can come up with. 
</P>
<P>
Director Alex Golson knows that and lets his Orange Coast College cast go at 
it. They scamper up the aisles, make big faces, flail at the songs and bring 
out one vaudeville shtick after another. These folks are partying. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the audience? Many people at a recent performance did seem to 
get swept up by it all, but almost an equal number appeared bewildered, or at 
least bored. Such haphazard energy, while always fresh at the outset, can get 
numbing fairly early on in the first act. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, there's tone to deal with. When "Godspell" was first produced in 1971 
(to thrilled crowds, by the way), it was like nails scratching a blackboard for 
many critics. They did not think it was sacrilegious -- "Godspell," in fact, is 
generally reverent -- but they did find it thwarted by persistently cute humor. 
That has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Christ wore a Superman suit and a red clown nose, and the recitation 
of biblical parables used various satires, including one on game shows. 
</P>
<P>
Under Golson's direction, "Godspell" is filled with a Pandora's Box of soft 
swipes at everything from Shirley MacLaine to the slow-motion running scenes in 
"Chariots of Fire." There's even a line about "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
A few are clever: John the Baptist baptizes everybody with a slap of a wet 
sponge, and the idea of having a character wheeze out "Rose . . . bud" before 
dying was good, tweaking fun. But many are just too corny or repeated to 
inanity, as when Christ says a line and the characters say it again, this time 
with slapstick emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
As for the voices, they are not exceptional but worthy enough to satisfy the 
routine score's needs. Andre de Leon as Christ and Ralph B. Pena as John the 
Baptist (he is also Judas later) sing decently, and their acting holds up. 
Actually, as both characters are the least overblown in this group, de Leon and 
Pena are welcome elements. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes (uncredited) are a mixed bag, sort of a hippie-cosmic chic, which 
is appropriate here. Jane Phillips Hobson's lights are jarring at times, but 
they get the job done. There is not much to the set (also uncredited), just a 
few boxes filled with props atop a stage bearing a large celestial design. 
</P>
<P>

GARBAGE CONTRACT AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a five-year, $2.4-million contract with Waste 
Management of Sun Valley Inc. to provide residential garbage collection and 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The company will begin serving residential customers Sept. 1, with the city's 
new recycling program to begin on a limited basis early next year, public works 
Director Chuck Bergson said. 
</P>
<P>
The company will service single-family homes and apartment units where trash 
containers of 45 gallons or less are used, Bergson said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 other waste disposal companies continue to contract with businesses 
and large apartment buildings for commercial pickups in West Hollywood. In 
July, however, those companies were required to have city licenses for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
For years, West Hollywood residents have complained about noisy garbage trucks 
in neighborhoods during prohibited hours and of streets strewn with garbage 
mishandled by carriers.

RULES ON SAVING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has adopted permanent water conservation measures based on 
emergency regulations implemented during last summer's drought. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Sept. 7, the city will ban the washing down of driveways and patios, 
the watering of lawns between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and the serving of water at 
restaurants unless requested by patrons. 
</P>
<P>
However, lawns may be watered daily rather than on alternate days, as was 
ordered last year. A ban on filling empty pools and spas has also been 
rescinded.

AIRPORT MAY GET RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has cleared the way for a 180-seat restaurant at Santa Monica 
Airport's new Clover Field Terminal and Administration Building. 
</P>
<P>
The Council voted 6 to 0 Tuesday night to authorize lease negotiations with Los 
Angeles restaurateurs Brian and Michael Vidor to build a two-story, 
4,600-square-foot restaurant, bar and concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
The Vidor restaurant, "The Typhoon," would be open six days a week and offer 
moderately priced Chinese and American cuisine. The Vidors would hold a 15-year 
lease with an option for a 10-year extension, and pay the city an annual rent 
of $38,452 plus 4% and 6% royalty fees on food and beverage sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Vidors' other restaurants include a Mexican food chain and a French bistro 
in the Northwest.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;

<P>
PLAN TO PLUG RENT LOOPHOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to plug a loophole in West Hollywood's tough rent control law has moved 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan unanimously approved by the City Council, landlords whose 
properties are exempt from rent control would have to provide relocation 
benefits to tenants forced to move by sharp rent increases. The council held 
off enacting an ordinance to allow city staff time to recommend how large such 
rent increases should be before triggering the relocation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Abbe Land said she introduced the measure after renters in a building 
complained of receiving notices that their rents were to be more than doubled, 
some from $1,100 to as much as $2,500. The owner wants to convert the 
apartments into condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Because the building at 944 Palm Ave. was in rental service prior to 1979, it 
is exempt from most provisions of West Hollywood's 1985 rent control law. 
However, owners of exempt buildings still must pay relocation fees for tenants 
if the property is removed from the rental market.

HAZARDOUS-WASTE ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has set Oct. 14 as the date for a citywide hazardous-waste 
roundup. 
</P>
<P>
Although similar collections have been staged in other cities, this will be a 
first for Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The collection, scheduled to take place between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. at a parking 
lot at 341 N. Foothill Road, is intended to help residents get rid of paints, 
solvents, motor oil, pool chemicals and other household wastes that are not 
supposed to go directly into landfills. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the City Council on Tuesday authorized the Chamber of Commerce 
to hire an agent to license the city logo, which includes a picture of City 
Hall, for commercial use in products and events. 
</P>
<P>
Staffers also reported that a 24-hour hot line has been established for 
residents to report graffiti. The city has hired a temporary worker to remove 
graffiti from public areas. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of private property owners are expected to clean up graffiti themselves, 
according to a leaflet that will be distributed in residents' water bills.

CANCER CENTER GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The W. M. Keck Foundation has awarded a $1.8-million grant to the cancer center 
at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica. Hospital officials 
said it was the largest single donation that the hospital has received. 
</P>
<P>
The cancer center is a comprehensive facility devoted to the early detection, 
treatment and prevention of cancer. It offers a variety of inpatient and 
outpatient services and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Keck Foundation, based in Los Angeles, was established by William M. Keck, 
the late founder of Superior Oil Co. A major contributor to colleges and

DAD TO RESIGN FROM RENT BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica Rent Control Board member Julie Lopez Dad has announced that she 
will resign from the office to return to community activism. 
</P>
<P>
Dad, who was appointed to the board in January, 1988, to fill an unexpired 
term, and elected in November, 1988, to a full four-year term, submitted her 
resignation to the board last week. She said she will stay until the end of the 
year to help implement the board's inclusionary housing program. 
</P>
<P>
It will be up to the other four members of the board to appoint someone to fill 
Dad's seat until the next scheduled municipal election in November, 1990. The 
resignation means that four of the five seats on the board will be up for 
election then. 
</P>
<P>
Dad, 45, a researcher for an investment firm in Westwood, said she is resigning 
because she believes the coming year will be a difficult year in which to 
accomplish anything on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at next year as being very tense," she said. "Elected office has 
never been my favorite place to be." 
</P>
<P>
The coming year shapes up as a busy one. In addition to the scheduled 
elections, the board has several vacancies to fill on its staff as a result of 
resignations. The board is also involved in protracted litigation about the 
overall constitutionality of the rent-control program and is attempting to 
implement its much-criticized inclusionary housing program this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The board will hold public hearings on the program, which would allow landlords 
to significantly raise rents on some units if they set aside an equal number of 
units at lower rents for poor and elderly people, this month and in September 
before taking a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
Dad said that although she will be leaving elected office, she plans to remain 
active in rent control and city planning issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people can accomplish more as community activists because of the 
dilution that takes place through political constraints," she said.

JOSEPH N. BELL: ATOM BOMBINGS -- A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week marks the 44th anniversary of the dropping of an atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima and -- three days later -- on Nagasaki. There have been and will be 
retrospectives in the newspapers and on TV, and those of us who happen to see 
them will think briefly about the portent of that week in 1945 -- and then go 
back to Indiana Jones or Tom Clancy or Roger Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
But I can't kiss off this anniversary that easily because it sets in motion a 
whole series of memories and speculations and musings that relate to what I was 
doing when those two devastating bombs were dropped on the direct orders of 
Harry S. Truman, President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
I was then a pilot in the Naval Air Transport Service. We island-hopped the 
Pacific, carrying wounded out and supplies and replacements in. The week 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed, I was stuck on the island of Manus in the 
Philippines. Some repair work had to be done on my plane, and I was at loose 
ends. (When this happened to me on Guam, Marines stationed there would take 
pilots -- for a fee -- out in Jeeps to flush out Japanese soldiers still holed 
up on the island. Not me.) 
</P>
<P>
So two days after the bombing of Hiroshima -- of which we had fitful news -- I 
commandeered a Jeep and wandered around Manus. Until that day, the most awesome 
sight I'd ever seen was the U.S. fleet standing off Okinawa to back up our 
invasion troops there. But Manus was even more awesome. For here had been 
stockpiled the material for the next -- and final -- step of our Pacific 
campaign: the invasion of Japan. Mile after mile of the weapons and support 
machinery of war. Here was the totality of the massive production effort to 
which the United States had geared up after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and it 
was mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also sobering. For the first time, I had a sense of the carnage that 
would follow an invasion of the Japanese homeland. The fanatical dedication 
with which the Japanese had fought on every island bastion in the Pacific would 
be doubled and redoubled when they were fighting on their own soil. The weapons 
I saw were inert, waiting -- almost ominously. But it was easy to project them 
into combat and to picture the hundreds of thousands of casualties among the 
soldiers who would man them. It was the first time that the full impact of that 
war hit me, along with an awareness of the masses of human beings yet to die 
before it could be brought to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
And so when I drank at the Officer's Club that night, I joined the toast to the 
atomic bomb that wrought such fearful carnage on Hiroshima. I wasn't thinking 
then about the morality of the act. About the thousands of people incinerated 
there. About this dreadful new force in the hands of flawed human beings. I was 
thinking only about my friends who would be killed if that invasion took place. 
And about my own life and how badly I wanted this war over so I could go home. 
</P>
<P>
My reaction was no different when we got news of the Nagasaki bombing. We spent 
very little time wondering if the second bomb had been necessary, if all those 
additional lives had to be wasted before finding out if the Hiroshima bomb 
would bring the Japanese Empire to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
I've gone through many evolutions of thought since that week 44 years ago. I've 
questioned decisions it never occurred to me to question then. And I've arrived 
at some conclusions that would have been impossible for me to reach in the 
immediacy of that upcoming invasion of Japan. I've also come to realize that 
both perspectives -- mine on that island in the Pacific, and the 
commander-in-chief's, far from the scene of battle -- should be considered in 
making cataclysmic decisions like the dropping of an atomic bomb. But in the 
final analysis, the only really valid perspective is provided by distance. It's 
impossible to see over horizons when you're standing hip-deep in the problem. 
</P>
<P>
This thought has come to me so often during the recurring crises with the 
hostages in Lebanon. It also came to me when we were being exhorted by the 
freedom fighters in Cuba and Hungary to take unilateral military action. We can 
be deeply moved by the plight of these people and their families, but to set 
national policy on the basis of those feelings would be as great a mistake as 
turning over to a battlefield commander the decision on whether to drop an 
atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
No one is more limited in grasping the big picture nor more likely to be 
betrayed by his or her feelings than the individual at the vortex of a problem. 
That is why that person shouldn't be allowed to make -- or even influence too 
deeply -- decisions with earth-shaking repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
I recall sometime during the early years of World War II, a large American 
fleet was under way to get into tactical position for a Japanese attack. A Navy 
plane went down from Adm. William Halsey's flagship, but the pilot was able to 
get free of the plane and into a life raft. My recollection -- whether the 
story is apocryphal or not -- is that Adm. Halsey held up the movement of that 
fleet for precious minutes while the pilot was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
Now to a pilot, that was the ultimate act of courage and humanity on Halsey's 
part, a resounding tribute to the value in which Americans hold individual 
life. But was the decision wise? How many dozens of ships and thousands of 
lives were put at risk to perform this one humanitarian act? 
</P>
<P>
And how many hundreds of thousands more lives would have been at risk had not 
the decision been made to drop the atomic bomb? It brought an end to World War 
II within a few weeks at a terrible toll to Japanese civilians in Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the men who created those bombs and had a part in delivering them have 
suffered ever since. Many of us who hailed this act when it took place have 
nurtured growing doubts in the hindsight of time and distance. Wasn't there 
some other way it might have been done -- a demonstration, perhaps? And was the 
Nagasaki bomb really necessary to end the war? 
</P>
<P>
These are tough, agonizing decisions that need to be made from the longest 
perspective and the widest possible range of vision -- because we have to live 
or die with them for a very long time.

BENNETT DRUG PROPOSAL SEEKS TO CUT USE 50% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a marked shift in the nation's anti-drug strategy, a plan nearing approval 
by the Bush Administration would direct hundreds of millions of dollars to 
cocaine-producing nations and crack-blighted inner cities while providing no 
new assistance for border interception programs, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping plan -- drafted by William J. Bennett, director of the White House 
Office of Drug Control Policy, and undergoing final Administration review this 
week -- pledges to cut drug consumption in the United States by 50% within the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy would move away from the border campaigns that were the hallmark 
of the war on drugs under former President Ronald Reagan to step up pressure in 
regions responsible for both the burgeoning supply and demand for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of concentrating in the middle of the burden, we'd prefer to 
concentrate on the ends," an Administration official said. "We think that's 
more effective." 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for more than tripling military and economic assistance for the 
cocaine-producing countries of Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, including the 
assignment of U.S. advisers to train troops there in anti-drug techniques. 
</P>
<P>
While the National Security Council has yet to approve the plan, officials said 
that the State Department and the Pentagon are believed likely to endorse the 
effort at White House meetings scheduled for later this week. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the plan calls for more than doubling federal aid earmarked for state 
and local law enforcement efforts and for a 50% increase in federal support for 
drug treatment programs, according to a draft copy of the proposal and 
officials familiar with its contents. 
</P>
<P>
It also embraces President Bush's previous commitment to a $600-million prison 
construction effort designed to increase the number of federal prison cells by 
as much as 85%. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the strategy urges that the nation increase its anti-drug spending next 
year by "many hundreds of millions" of dollars beyond what Bush already had 
proposed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is to be presented to Bush on Friday during meetings of the NSC 
and the Domestic Policy Council. After reviewing the plan during a summer 
vacation at his home in Kennebunkport, Me., the President will unveil the 
strategy to the nation during a prime-time television address Sept. 5, a 
deadline set by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Changes Expected 
</P>
<P>
The current proposal is based on five months of research by Bennett and his 
staff. While some federal agencies have expressed reservations about parts of 
the Bennett proposal, knowledgeable officials said Wednesday that they expect 
it to survive essentially intact. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by Bush and adopted by Congress, the plan would launch a federal 
anti-drug effort of unprecedented scope, with an overall budget of more than 
$6.1 billion, some $2 billion greater than 1989 outlays on anti-drug programs, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The draft copy of the Bennett plan does not propose a source of funding for the 
increased effort. A White House official said that the Office of Management and 
Budget had prepared a financing plan but declined to say what agencies might 
suffer cutbacks as a result. 
</P>
<P>
To multiply the effect of the spending, the strategy would use federal money as 
a lever to force states and municipal governments to tighten laws against 
illegal drug users and commit more money to the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as a condition of receiving federal highway money, states would be 
required to revoke the drivers licenses of convicted drug users and to impose a 
delay on the issuance of licenses to juvenile offenders. To receive federal 
grants and student aid, universities would be required to establish anti-drug 
programs on campus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflects Changing View 
</P>
<P>
The plan would more than double, from $150 million this year to $350 million 
next year, the amount of direct federal aid to state and local law enforcement. 
An increase of that magnitude, long opposed by the Reagan Administration, 
reflects the new Administration's view that the explosion of street crime 
caused by crack cocaine represents the most urgent drug-related problem facing 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A draft of the report lists Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston and the 
southwest border as potential "high-intensity drug-trafficking areas" that 
could qualify for infusions of federal law enforcement aid. But a knowledgeable 
official said that no final designations will be made until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting new spending for drug interdiction along the U.S. border, the plan 
would delay the implementation of several programs once envisioned as playing a 
central role in the war on drugs, an official acknowledged. One program likely 
to be postponed is a U.S. Customs Service-Coast Guard proposal to line the 
borders with radar balloons, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The draft copy being circulated within the government does not include 
information about its international initiatives, which remain classified. But 
sources confirmed that the plan calls for at least $300 million in increased 
U.S. aid to drug-producing countries and would require American troops to play 
a stepped-up role in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done virtually nothing serious in terms of money to those countries in 
the past," one official said. "It's time to give this our full attention." 
</P>
<P>
When the plan was broached last month, the State Department expressed concern 
about providing an abrupt increase in aid to the three Latin American 
countries, which together received only about $57 million this year. At the 
same time, the Pentagon voiced qualms about the risks that new troop deployment 
might pose. 
</P>
<P>
But sources said that remaining opposition to the Bennett plan within the two 
agencies focuses primarily on budgetary concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, one source said, has a "dread fear" that it might be 
asked to shoulder the burden for any influx in aid. Added another senior 
official: "Where are you going to get the money unless you take it away from 
somebody else at state?" 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat surprisingly, an equally controversial element of the program involves 
the ambitious nature of the goals it sets. 
</P>
<P>
In aiming to reduce drug consumption by 50% within a decade and by 10% within 
the next two years, Bennett sought to seek "numerical, quantifiable goals 
against which the national effort can be measured," one source contended. 
</P>
<P>
But others within the Administration, the official said, have worried aloud 
that "we might be promising too much."

CLAMOR INCREASING IN U.S. FOR TRADE WAR WITH JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Is the United States finally about to "get tough" with Japan on trade? 
</P>
<P>
If America's business elite is an accurate barometer, get ready for a trade 
war. Business leaders and Wall Street financiers, who traditionally have 
shunned aggressive trade policies in any form, are clamoring in significant 
numbers for action against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"What sparked the shift in the position of the American business community? In 
a word, frustration," says Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the 
international trade subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee. "With Japan, 
free trade simply has not worked." 
</P>
<P>
But powerful forces are pushing in the opposite direction as well. For all the 
differences between the United States and Japan, financial and technological 
changes are forcing the world's two biggest economic powers to cooperate with 
each other more closely than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese and U.S. economies have become deeply intertwined over the past 
decade," said Raymond Vernon, a Harvard University international economist. 
"With hundreds of billions of dollars of Japan's assets in the United States, 
each country has a hand on the other's throat. Threatening Japan makes no more 
sense than threatening a first strike in nuclear politics." 
</P>
<P>
What is at stake is nothing less than the strength and stability of the 
non-communist world heading into the 21st Century. The economic competition 
between the United States and Japan is fast catching up with the military 
contest between the United States and the Soviet Union as the central focus of 
U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning by Bush 
</P>
<P>
It is the Bush Administration's instinct to draw closer to Japan. President 
Bush, alarmed by growing sentiment against Japanese investment in the United 
States, warned Americans earlier this year that, if Japan stopped buying U.S. 
securities, that would only make the federal budget deficit more difficult to 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Administration policy paper named Japan as America's most important 
ally in the Pacific. Secretary of State James A. Baker III proposed that the 
United States and Japan work closely together to establish a new international 
body to encourage economic and political cooperation in the Pacific Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has become a world power," the secretary said in a speech to the Asia 
Society in New York late last month. "We applaud this achievement, which holds 
so much promise for the future. But, to make the most of that promise, the 
United States and Japan must build a new and truly global partnership." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Punishment for Surpluses 
</P>
<P>
However, Administration officials recognize that economic nationalism -- 
pressure to make America first again -- limits how close it can draw to Japan. 
Voters are demanding that Japan be punished for its huge trade surpluses with 
the United States. And members of Congress are listening. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a xenophobia developing on both sides of the U.S.-Japan 
relationship," said a senior Administration official who asked not to be 
identified. Unless the Administration acknowledges that and takes at least 
moderate actions against Japan, he said, Congress will force its hand. 
</P>
<P>
"But Congress also has to realize that Japan is not a nation we can kick around 
with impunity . . . " this official added. "We don't live in a unilateral world 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
Like their American counterparts, many Japanese leaders see the necessity of 
developing a new partnership with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 100 years of Pax Britannica and 50 years of Pax Americana," Tomomitsu 
Oba, a senior official at the Ministry of Finance, told a Pacific Rim 
conference in Nagoya last year. "What comes next? Pax Consortia!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift in Economic Power 
</P>
<P>
It may be an uneasy peace, if history is any guide. David Hale, chief economist 
at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago and a specialist in economic history, 
argues in the spring issue of Foreign Policy magazine that today's shift of 
global economic power is unprecedented since the years between the world wars. 
</P>
<P>
"In that period," Hale said, "British financial power was on the decline and 
American economic power was on the rise. This contributed to global instability 
because the United States was an immature creditor power reluctant to abandon 
its tradition of protectionism . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Today, America's financial power is on the wane, while Japan is emerging as a 
major creditor power. As with their American counterparts during the late 
1920s, Japanese policy-makers traditionally have been inward looking and 
reluctant to assume a larger global leadership role, creating a potential 
vacuum in the world economic adjustment process." 
</P>
<P>
Such analysts as Nathaniel Thayer of Johns Hopkins University's School of 
Advanced International Studies and longtime Tokyo consultant James Abegglen 
warn that the new economic interdependence between Japan and the United States 
will breed knotty disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying question in all this is whether Japan can tolerate dependence 
on America for a market, for investment and the like, and can the United States 
tolerate its dependence on Japan for capital and for key products," Abegglen 
said. "The fact is, we're not so good at handling this degree of intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
Past trade disputes were limited to such relatively narrow areas as textiles 
and steel. But, in recent years, as the two economies have become more 
entangled, conflicts have developed for more fundamental reasons: Japan's 
archaic product-distribution system, which critics argue discriminates against 
foreign goods; government-sponsored research projects in both Japan and the 
United States, and Japan's cut-rate sales of computer memory chips to other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the rhetoric of warfare is in the air on both sides of the 
Pacific. Karel van Wolferen, a Dutch journalist who has lived for 25 years in 
Tokyo and has written a new book about the entrenched Japanese political 
system, paints a picture of a wayward, almost fascist Japanese economy that is 
a danger to the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Writer James Fallows, in a widely discussed Atlantic magazine article entitled 
"Containing Japan," applies the same term to America's chief Asian ally that 
Sovietologist George F. Kennan coined in the late 1940s to describe the U.S. 
policy of holding Soviet expansionism in check. 
</P>
<P>
Containing Japan was what was on the minds of two key committees representing 
American business when they recommended earlier this year that the United 
States abandon its traditional free-trade approach to dealing with Japan. They 
urged that the United States switch to "managed trade" and negotiate specific 
goals for Japanese purchases of American goods. 
</P>
<P>
One of the committees was a Bush Administration advisory council, headed by 
American Express Co. chief executive James D. Robinson III and salted with such 
pillars of the industrial establishment as John Akers, chairman of IBM, Allen 
E. Murray, president of Mobil Corp., and Edward Pratt, chairman of Pfizer Corp. 
The other panel, known as the Emergency Committee for American Trade, 
represents 67 major U.S. corporations that historically had advocated free 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups insisted that the Japanese trade surplus with the United States 
should be slashed by whatever means necessary. They condemned Japan's entire 
economic structure, not just its tendency to close its markets to foreign 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the different structures of the two economies, trade policy solutions 
lie somewhere between free trade" and "managed trade," the Administration 
advisory council concluded. Trade policy, it said, must become 
"results-oriented." The United States would set the goals -- the Japanese might 
agree to buy a certain number of U.S. supercomputers, for example -- and the 
Japanese would be expected to achieve them or else face possible retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal sparked a heated debate. Clyde V. Prestowitz, a former Commerce 
Department official, contends that the United States and Japan already have 
adopted a system of managed trade, although they have yet to acknowledge it. 
"We know that we are not going to have open markets, so let's establish some 
criteria," Prestowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Z. Lawrence, a Brookings Institution economist, disagrees. "The United 
States is likely to be far worse off under a system of managed trade than we 
were before," Lawrence said. "What we need most is a system that is open to 
American exports. Our interest in an open trading system has never been 
greater." 
</P>
<P>
Managed trade received a tryout in May when the Bush Administration, invoking 
Section 301 of the 1988 trade law, accused Japan of unfair trade in satellites, 
supercomputers and lumber. If the Administration cannot negotiate reductions in 
the alleged trade barriers, Bush may order sanctions against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews in Japan were decidedly not favorable. "We will not accept any 
negotiations proposed in the framework of Section 301, with its threat of 
unilateral measures," Japan's then-chief cabinet secretary, Keizo Obuchi, 
asserted within hours after the Administration's move. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Japan expressed a willingness to accept a separate U.S. 
proposal to establish a joint high-level committee to examine structural 
impediments to trade. The Japanese were more receptive because the United 
States promised that the talks would be two-way, focusing on the outsized U.S. 
budget deficit as well as trade barriers in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's double-edged response points up the danger of the more confrontational 
approach. If the United States merely provokes retaliation every time it acts 
against perceived unfair trade practices by Japan, it may lose more than it 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that worldwide production of goods has left many American 
companies dependent on Japanese firms for crucial components of their products. 
</P>
<P>
Consider what happened when the Bush Administration was debating which Japanese 
products it might retaliate against in response to Japan's failure to open its 
market in cellular telephone services to Motorola, which makes high-quality 
cellular telephones and other mobile radio equipment. Dozens of American 
enterprises -- from Sematech, the consortium of semiconductor makers, to Estee 
Lauder, the cosmetics company -- lined up to argue that the fallout would 
damage their own ability to compete in international markets. 
</P>
<P>
"What always happens in these cases is that the same companies that are 
lobbying the U.S. government to be tough are also trying to make sure the 
retaliation doesn't jeopardize any of their suppliers or business interests," 
Lionel Olmer, a former Commerce Department trade official, explained. "But it's 
impossible not to jeopardize somebody's interest." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the risks, it is clear that the United States and Japan are moving 
into unmapped territory with unknown consequences for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of an era," Abegglen said. "The United States suddenly is aware 
that there is a limit to what you can demand of Japan. So maybe we do better if 
we're not quite so close. Maybe it's time for Japan to tell us to go pound sand 
when our demands are unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
And, in Japan, the recent defection of millions of voters from the ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party creates a shaky political climate that makes Tokyo 
less likely to want to forge closer ties with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts hope that a more mature relationship between the United States 
and Japan will emerge in place of the outdated postwar alliance, in which the 
United States played the confident teacher while Japan assumed the rule of 
dutiful student. Japanese officials served notice during a visit last February 
that Japan wants a wider say on a broad array of economic and foreign policy 
issues, ranging from international debt to relations with the Soviet Union. 
Baker says that the United States will encourage such a shift. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, the worsening of U.S.-Japanese relations over the next five to 10 
years will also prove beneficial to the long-term relationship between the two 
nations . . . " Alan Webber, managing editor of the Harvard Business Review, 
said. "The benefit will be for each side to correct its false impression of the 
other and emerge from a period of greater hostility with a relationship based 
on greater understanding." 
</P>
<P>
But the adjustment will not be painless. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Americans are deeply confused by a world in which economic rivalries 
between political allies are assuming greater importance than the simpler Cold 
War struggle between communism and the free world. 
</P>
<P>
In the emerging new world, it is no longer so easy to distinguish the good guys 
from the bad guys. From now on, in fact, they may well be one and the same.

COLIN POWELL TO BE NAMED HEAD OF JOINT CHIEFS 
</P>

<P>
In a move that would break one of the U.S. armed forces' last color barriers, 
President Bush will name Colin Powell, a 52-year-old black Army general, to 
become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Administration sources said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
If his appointment is confirmed by the Senate, Powell will become Bush's top 
adviser on military affairs and the nation's senior military officer in a 
position that was greatly expanded in scope by a 1986 defense reorganization 
bill. Powell would also be a principal adviser to the defense secretary and the 
National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to announce his choice of Powell, who served as former 
President Ronald Reagan's sixth national security adviser, this afternoon. 
Powell would replace Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the outgoing chairman. 
</P>
<P>
At 52, Powell would be the youngest chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Powell said that the President would find in him a 
consensus-seeking adviser sensitive to the vagaries of domestic and diplomatic 
politics. At the same time, the armed services would have as their leader an 
officer who started military life in 1958 as an infantryman and eagerly sought 
escape from a succession of political jobs to return to the command of "mud 
soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Powell is currently commander in chief of Forces Command, which is responsible 
for the readiness of military units stationed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to that military post in April after serving as White House 
national security adviser from December, 1987, to January, 1989, when Bush 
named retired Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft to the White House position. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources said that Powell appeared to be Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney's strong preference for the senior military post. Powell met with Cheney 
at the Pentagon on Tuesday to discuss the job, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell won praise from lawmakers for helping to restore order to the White 
House National Security Council in the wake of disclosures that an NSC 
operation sold arms to Iran and diverted the profits to the rebels in 
Nicaragua.

At the time of the Iran-Contra scandal, Powell had been the military aide to 
then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. In that capacity, Powell 
administered the transfer of anti-tank missiles from Army stocks to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
But Powell escaped criticism for his role in the affair and later in his 
capacity as national security adviser, even after many experts recommended that 
military officers should be barred from holding the sensitive White House 
position. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to confirm Powell, whose name has been widely circulated 
as Crowe's successor, without controversy. He would become the 12th chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff since the position was created in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"Powell's strength would fit right into the Crowe mold, in that he's got a 
strategic sense as well as a good sense of military operation," one Capitol 
Hill aide said. "He also can look across military service lines and set broader 
defense priorities. That's especially important in the current era of fiscal 
constraints." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing Powell for the post, Bush passed over several more senior 
candidates. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. 
Robert T. Herres, was believed to be a contender for the position. Air Force 
Chief of Staff Larry D. Welch also was considered a possible successor to 
Crowe, although Welch's prospects appeared to dim in the wake of a dispute with 
Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
After completing a four-year term, Crowe is to retire on Sept. 30. The chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff normally serves a two-year term, although his tour 
of duty is determined by the President. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son of Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
Powell was born in New York, the son of Jamaican immigrants, and is a graduate 
of City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
He commanded the Army's 5th Corps in Frankfurt, West Germany, a position that 
is both politically sensitive and militarily important. He won a Bronze Star 
and a Purple Heart for service in Vietnam and commanded an infantry battalion 
in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Powell's modest approach was highly praised -- and 
criticized.

BUSH SAYS HE'LL SPEAK TO ANYONE TO FREE HOSTAGES 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration, despite its stated policy of refusing to negotiate 
with terrorists, signaled Wednesday that it is prepared to deal -- even with 
terrorists -- if that will help secure the return of eight American hostages 
held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, President Bush outlined in a series of statements what a senior White 
House aide called a new definition of his policy to encourage "maximum 
dialogue" with Iran and to emphasize that he is "willing to talk to anybody and 
pursue any avenue" to free the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
And privately, a State Department official went even further, declaring that 
"in theory, we are prepared to deal even with the Hezbollah (the militant 
pro-Iranian group), if that is what it takes to get the hostages out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepared to Bargain 
</P>
<P>
Although Administration officials insisted that the policy is merely being 
redefined and not substantively changed, their statements appeared to leave 
little doubt that one way or another, the United States is prepared to bargain 
with terrorist groups holding the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration might not deal directly with Iran or terrorist groups, but 
it seems willing to strike a deal by negotiating through a third party. Also, 
the Administration clearly is hoping that Israel will be able to work out a 
hostage swap. 
</P>
<P>
A team of Israelis reportedly is seeking an intermediary to help it negotiate a 
hostage swap with the Hezbollah movement. The Israelis are holding Sheik Abdel 
Karim Obeid, a Hezbollah leader abducted from Lebanon by Israeli commandos on 
July 28. They hope to swap Obeid and possibly other prisoners for the release 
of the American hostages and three Israeli soldiers held by terrorists in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Report, a private intelligence newsletter published by the Economist of 
London, will report in today's issue that while Israel would prefer a party 
such as the International Red Cross to be the intermediary, Hezbollah is said 
to prefer Algeria, which "is considered unreliable by Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's first priority is the safe return home of the three Israeli soldiers, 
if all three are indeed alive. The Israelis have "certain evidence" that one of 
them is alive, sources said, but they are concerned that one or both of the 
others might be dead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that one reason the terrorists haven't been talking much about 
swapping prisoners with Israel is that all the soldiers aren't still living," 
said a U.S. intelligence source. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has made several statements in the past two days 
outlining what White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called a new 
"definition" of its stated policy opposing negotiating for the release of 
hostages, beginning with a comment in an interview that appeared in Wednesday's 
Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had not forsaken the no-negotiations policy, Bush told the 
newspaper: "If I can talk to somebody and get the release of an American 
hostage and do it without -- in my view and in the view of the experts -- 
putting others at risk, I'd be glad to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Later, at the White House, Bush told reporters that, despite the new 
interpretation the Administration has placed on its policy, he doesn't think 
there has been any "subtle change" in his position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Channel 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I hope I am open-minded enough to talk to and to exercise every 
diplomatic channel I can to free these Americans. And no American is going to 
be content until these Americans are free." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater told The Times that Bush is now defining the policy in a way that 
should make it clear to the Iranians that the United States wants to establish 
clear lines of communication through an intermediary to facilitate a dialogue 
on the hostage issue. 
</P>
<P>
"You can say it's a signal to Iran, and we clearly want to encourage maximum 
dialogue," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration hopes the election last week of Hashemi Rafsanjani 
as Iran's new president signals a change of attitude on the part of the Iranian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policies haven't changed," he said, "but we want to state them in a way 
that maximizes the opportunity for dialogue. We haven't done that before." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior intelligence source said that "a lot of very delicate 
things are going on" in pursuing negotiations with Iran through third countries 
to try to seek the release of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Algerian Role 
</P>
<P>
Algeria, which has played a major role in negotiating for the release of 
hostages in several other cases, including when a TWA jetliner was hijacked in 
the summer of 1985, has emerged as a prominent intermediary in current 
discussions, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, Switzerland and other European allies with Middle East connections, as 
well as Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Jordan, also have tried in various ways to 
help the U.S. secure the release of the hostages, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said Bush has solicited the help of a number of 
countries until the process sorts itself out and both sides can agree on an 
acceptable intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
"Algeria could deal directly with Hezbollah and the Iranians, while the Swiss 
and Japanese do the formal diplomatic stuff," one State Department official 
said. "No decision has been made yet about who'll do the main mediation." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is waiting for Iran to make the next move, the official said, 
adding: "We're not going to make specific proposals to them. We want them to 
make an offer to get the hostages free." 
</P>
<P>
With the United States engaging in discussions directly with Syria and 
indirectly through third parties with Iran, a White House official said one of 
the more hopeful signs is that "the dialogue has tended to move away from 
individual hostage cases to government-to-government relations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Chaff' 
</P>
<P>
"And there are signs, a lot of statements by various people in Iran and Syria, 
that we find different and significant and encouraging," the official said. "On 
the other hand, there is a lot of chaff out there, and the trick is to give it 
time to sort itself out." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, during a brief question-and-answer session in the Oval Office, said he is 
getting mixed signals from Iran. But he sounded cautiously optimistic that, 
with other parties aiding the United States, progress might be made in seeking 
release of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
He promised to pursue every diplomatic channel to obtain their release and said 
they are "too precious for me to be sticking my head in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
While political concerns have caused some parties to remain ambivalent or 
silent in the past, Bush said, they are now willing to help because they are 
"so infuriated or angered or repulsed" by a videotape released by terrorists 
last week that showed the body of an American hostage, identified as Marine Lt. 
Col. William R. Higgins, hanging from a rope. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape, said Bush, as well as a videotape of another American hostage, 
Joseph J. Cicippio, pleading for his life after repeated death threats, have 
made people say: "There's a common thread -- look, this is too much. Enough is 
enough."

STATE LACKS MANPOWER TO FIGHT COCAINE DEALERS, ATTY. GEN. SAYS 
</P>

Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said Wednesday that state narcotics agents know 
of more than 5,000 suspected Colombian cocaine traffickers in Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and Sacramento counties alone, but that they don't have the manpower 
to deal with what he called "the No. 1 organized crime threat in California." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, also a Democratic candidate for governor, made the remarks at a 
conference of California organized crime and anti-terrorism specialists. He 
praised local drug agencies for their efforts against well-organized Colombian 
cocaine cartels but said identification of traffickers does not mean they will 
be caught. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to fight a big-league drug problem with a little-league 
enforcement team," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said he will direct "every penny and every agent" 
available to the state at the Colombian cocaine network, but said more federal 
help is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been quiet, we have just been ignored," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State narcotics enforcement officials echoed the concern that suspected 
Colombian traffickers are operating freely. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that we know who they are, but we don't have the resources to get 
them. We have to show in court they are dealing beyond a doubt and it is hard 
to get informants -- the traffickers are pretty violent folks," said Tom 
Gorman, assistant chief for the state narcotics enforcement bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said a federal crackdown on cocaine in South Florida has 
caused an exodus of traffickers to the "promised land" of California. He called 
on Bush Administration Drug Czar William Bennett to come up with a 
comprehensive national plan that will prevent drug traffickers from simply 
relocating when federal pressure is applied. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been disappointed in the President's policies in the war against 
cocaine," Van de Kamp said after the speech. "I hope he starts thinking of it 
as a federal problem." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said that Bennett, who will unveil the Bush Administration's 
strategy in the drug war Sept. 5, should establish a Southern California drug 
task force such as the one created in Florida in 1982. He said the number of 
federal drug agents in the state should be doubled. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Drug Enforcement Agency in Los Angeles County now has 83 agents, 
compared to 341 in Miami and 314 in New York, Van de Kamp said. Nearly half of 
all the cocaine coming into the country moves through California, according to 
the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp also asked the federal government to cooperate in converting unused 
military property into desert prison camps for drug offenders.

AVERAGE U.S. COLLEGE TUITION JUMPS 7%-9%; MORE SCHOOLS TOP $20,000 
</P>

<P>
The average cost of attending a four-year college or university in the United 
States will jump between 7% and 9% this autumn, according to a national survey 
released today by the College Board. 
</P>
<P>
The tuition hikes significantly outpaced overall inflation for the ninth 
consecutive year and mean that annual education bills of more than $20,000 are 
becoming more common. 
</P>
<P>
At private four-year schools, the average tuition and fees will total $8,737, 
up 9% from last year, while those costs at public institutions will average 
$1,694, up 7%. Room and board will average $3,460, up about 6%, and other costs 
such as transportation and books will add another $1,800, according to the 
study by the organization known for its college entrance examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that higher education should control costs better. They 
question why increases in college tuition are not more in line with the 5.2% 
rise in the national consumer price index for the school year ending in June. 
</P>
<P>
The survey and such criticism attracted special interest this week as the 
federal Justice Department confirmed that its antitrust division is 
investigating tuition-setting and financial aid practices at about 20 
prestigious colleges and universities, primarily in the East. The schools say 
they have long shared information about scholarships to prevent bidding wars 
and educators deny any collusion. 
</P>
<P>
University officials stress that salaries and benefits, their largest expenses, 
rise faster than the index of goods and services measured by the consumer price 
index. In addition, they say that about half of all college students receive 
some form of financial aid, whether scholarships or loans or work-study jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Faculty salaries did not keep pace with inflation in the '70s and early '80s," 
said Hans Giesecke, marketing and research director for the Assn. of 
Independent California Colleges and Universities. "Most of our member 
institutions are trying to make up for that." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Sykes, author of "ProfScam," a recent book highly critical of academia, 
rejects that argument and accuses universities of creating wasteful 
Pentagon-like bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely amazing. After a while you wonder whether there is a limit to 
the chutzpah of higher education in asking for more," he said during a 
telephone interview from his Milwaukee home. He said students may soon revolt 
against further increases. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most expensive colleges in the nation are Sarah Lawrence College in 
New York, where tuition, fees, room and board will total $19,980; Bennington 
College in Vermont, $19,975; Brandeis University in Massachusetts, $19,970; and 
Barnard College in New York, $19,952. Other expenses, including books and 
transportation, will push costs at these schools well over $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the survey found, the most expensive bills for tuition, fees, 
room and board will be at Stanford University, $19,164; Pepperdine University, 
$18,730; USC, $18,728; Pitzer College, $18,672; and Scripps College, $18,440. 
</P>
<P>
The price issue is so sensitive that the College Board broke its tradition of 
listing the top 10 most expensive schools and refused to provide reporters the 
entire national school-by-school results. However, it did release the 
California figures to The Times and, upon special request, provided numbers 
about a few Eastern schools that topped the national list in recent years. A 
College Board spokeswoman said that the press in the past distorted the issue 
by concentrating on the higher end of costs. 
</P>
<P>
At Bennington College, which has a student body of about 600, spokesman David 
Scribner attributed the high price tag to the cost of small classes, which 
allow lots of contact with professors. "We may be expensive, but it's worth 
it," he said. "I don't feel defensive about this and the college doesn't." Last 
year, 53% of Bennington students received a grant from the school, averaging 
$9,600, Scribner added in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ranslow, vice president of admissions and college relations at Pitzer 
College in Claremont, said independent colleges are worried about what he 
called "bifurcation" in the student body: more affluent students whose families 
can afford tuition and more low-income students who receive large scholarships 
but fewer middle-class ones. That has been caused in part by federal and state 
aid not keeping up with costs and a shift from government grants to loans, he 
and other education officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about cutting expenses, Ranslow speculated that the 700-student school 
could increaseclass size, freeze faculty pay, defer maintenance, stop buying 
computers and trim scholarships. "But we find all that untenable," he stated. 
</P>
<P>
The strength and relative bargain costs of California's public universities 
make the situation more troublesome for some independent schools here. 
Education fees this year at the University of California will be $1,660, up 3%, 
but slightly below the national average for four-year public institutions; at 
Cal State campuses, fees are up 3.6% to $708. Community college fees here 
remain $100, well below the national average of $842 for public two-year 
schools. Room and board at California state universities average about $4,200. 
</P>
<P>
The gap between the cost of private and public education in California can be 
bridged up to $5,250 by Cal Grants, the state scholarships. Nevertheless, the 
California private schools have seen a drop in the overall number of freshmen 
from California and are recruiting out of state more than in the past, 
according to the independent colleges' association. 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, urged students and their 
families to look hard for financial aid and cautioned them against choosing a 
college by just price. "Despite annual increases in college charges, students 
and parents should realize that a college education continues to be within 
reach of virtually every qualified student," Stewart wrote in the survey 
report, which included information from 1,892 institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the survey, U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos 
promised Wednesday to work to ensure that high tuition does not prevent young 
people from attending college. "But I cannot do it alone," Cavazos said in a 
prepared statement. "Every leader in higher education must make holding costs 
down a priority." 
</P>
<P>
Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Assn. of Independent Colleges and 
Universities, warned that the costs of a college education would continue to 
rise until the federal and state governments, businesses, foundations and 
alumni "assume a more balanced share of the necessary funding." 
</P>
<P>
One exception to the trend is Lambuth College, a Methodist institution of 767 
students in Jackson, Tenn. The school claims to be the only four-year private 
liberal arts college in the nation to not increase tuition for the last four 
years. Freezing tuition at $3,986, along with more recruiting, cost-cutting and 
fund-raising, helped Lambuth emerge from a crisis of declining enrollment and 
deficits, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lambuth spokeswoman Cindy Benson conceded that tuition probably will 
rise next year. "The costs we deal with are just like those at all the other 
colleges," she said in an interview Wednesday.

HEAVY STORMS RIP DESERTS; ROADS CUT OFF, TOWN FLOODED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Heavy, wind-swept thunderstorms that blocked the Los Angeles Aqueduct near 
Olancha hammered California deserts for the second straight night on Wednesday, 
flooding the Imperial County town of Winterhaven and cutting several major 
highways across the state. 
</P>
<P>
The storms prompted flash-flood warnings Wednesday along a 200-mile front from 
the Mexican border to the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Torrents of water up to two feet deep poured into homes in Winterhaven, a 
Colorado River town about five miles northeast of Yuma, Ariz., and water up to 
three feet deep closed Interstate 8 -- the main route east from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Across the river, in Yuma, officials said much of the city was awash, although 
the flooding was shallower. "Most of our roads are gone," said Yuma County 
sheriff's Deputy Kevin Kretchmer. "Lots of homes have water in them and we have 
poles and wires down." 
</P>
<P>
Strong downpours were reported Wednesday night throughout eastern San Diego, 
Imperial, San Bernardino and Riverside counties, especially in locations below 
the eastern slope of the coastal mountain ranges -- places like Barstow, Palm 
Springs, Desert Hot Springs, Indio and Thermal. Minor flooding was reported in 
Palm Springs about 10 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of an inch of rain fell near Santa Ysabel, in eastern San 
Diego County, in less than half an hour Wednesday afternoon. Powerful 
cloudbursts were also reported Wednesday night in the Mojave Desert near Baker 
and Twentynine Palms, in the Owens Valley near Olancha and in Mono County near 
Benton, about 30 miles north of Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters warned Wednesday afternoon that flooding could cut Interstate 10 
near Blythe and Interstate 40 near Needles -- two of the principal 
thoroughfares to the east -- during the night. California 6 and California 120 
were closed by floodwaters Wednesday night south and west of Benton, and debris 
blocked California 168 near Deep Springs, about 30 miles northeast of Lone 
Pine. 
</P>
<P>
To the east, more storms spawned by the same, subtropical weather system washed 
across southern Nevada and western Arizona on Wednesday. Dust storms generated 
by the storm system cut visibility to less than half a mile in the Phoenix 
area, and Arizona 95 was reported "barely passable" because of recurrent 
downpours and flash-flooding in western Nevada's Esmeralda County. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, severe thunderstorms swept through the Las Vegas area 
bringing winds gusting up to 99 m.p.h. and causing damage estimated at $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected to Continue 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said the storms, generated by a large, high-pressure system that 
has been pumping moist, subtropical air into the Southwest from Mexico, were 
expected to continue today, with more threats of flash-flooding over large 
areas of California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Utility crews were working around the clock near Olancha in Inyo County in an 
effort to remove an estimated 100,000 cubic yards of mud, rock and sand that 
were dumped into a two-mile stretch of the Los Angeles Aqueduct during an 
intense thunderstorm Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the tide of flood debris from the eastern slope of the Sierra 
raced down Olancha Creek and poured into the aqueduct, which carries about 75% 
of Los Angeles' water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The debris quickly filled the open, concrete-lined ditch, causing the water 
flowing down the aqueduct channel at about 4,500 gallons per second to spill 
over onto U.S. 395. The overflow flooded the highway with several feet of 
water, cutting off all traffic on the main route between Southern California 
and the resort country of the eastern Sierra for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
The utility crews had to open several spillways that empty into Owens Lake to 
drain the upstream reach of the aqueduct before the cleanup of the 
31-foot-wide, 15-foot-deep channel could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Although the aqueduct cleanup is expected to take another seven to 10 days, the 
city of Los Angeles will continue to receive an adequate supply of water from 
reservoirs and through purchases from the Metropolitan Water District, which 
draws on other sources, including the Colorado River, the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Williams, a DWP engineer, said that returning the aqueduct to service 
could take even longer if crews removing the debris find that the concrete 
lining has sustained heavy damage. 
</P>
<P>
More thunderstorms were reported in the area Wednesday night. While little 
additional debris was drifting into the channel, crews said the heavy weather 
was slowing the cleanup effort.

LAWS BLAMED FOR DEARTH OF INFANT ORGANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is "not feasible" to harvest organs from brain-defective babies within the 
restrictions of current laws requiring that the infants be declared brain dead 
before organ procurement, according to a report by Loma Linda University 
Medical Center researchers in Wednesday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joyce L. Peabody, Loma Linda's chief of neonatology, Dr. Janet R. Emery and 
Dr. Stephen Ashwal said that "some other mechanism" for increasing the supply 
of organs must be sought, such as procuring organs from animals or changing 
current laws so that organs could be harvested from anencephalic infants who do 
not meet brain death criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Anencephalics are born missing parts of the brain and skull. Untreated, they 
usually die at birth or within several days. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that they could maintain the function of the 
anencephalic's organs by providing intensive care from birth, but that the 
dying process was prolonged as well. But when intensive care was delayed until 
death was imminent, the organs were damaged and no longer suitable for 
transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
The report is the first account in a medical journal of Loma Linda's 
controversial anencephalic organ donor program. The program started in 
December, 1987, two months after the medical center's Dr. Leonard Bailey 
performed the first successful heart transplant from an anencephalic infant. 
Paul Holc, the Canadian infant who received the heart, is now living with his 
parents in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
But the next 13 attempts to harvest organs from anencephalic babies failed. As 
a result, Loma Linda officials halted the program in July, 1988. Currently, 
there are no active programs for harvesting organs from anencephalic donors in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Loma Linda report was published along with two commentaries, one supporting 
and one opposing a change in current laws so that organs could be harvested 
from anencephalics before they were declared brain dead. 
</P>
<P>
Brain death, the legally accepted standard for death, means a complete loss of 
brain function, even though the heart may continue to beat. While anencephalics 
are born missing much of the brain, the brain stem, which controls breathing 
and other reflex activities, may continue to function. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday, Peabody said that changing the law "would save 
the greatest number of infants." But she cautioned that the law should not be 
changed unless a consensus supporting it developed within society. "I 
personally don't think we have a consensus right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Medical advances have made transplants in newborns feasible, but the shortage 
of small organs sharply limits the number of infants who might benefit from 
this therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Loma Linda physicians had hoped that the anencephalic babies could be declared 
brain dead while their heart, liver and kidneys remained undamaged and suitable 
for transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that placing such newborns on life support raises ethical 
concerns, because life was being prolonged not for the benefit of the patient 
but for the sole purpose of harvesting organs. They also calculate that few 
infants might benefit. For example, Dr. D. Alan Shewmon, a child neurologist at 
UCLA Medical Center, has estimated that the annual number of infants in the 
country who might benefit 10 years from now is "at most" 25 kidney recipients, 
12 heart recipients and 7 liver recipients. 
</P>
<P>
The new Loma Linda report describes attempts to harvest organs from 12 
live-born anencephalic infants. At birth, their hearts, livers and kidneys 
appeared to be normal. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the 12 infants met the criteria for total brain death within one week of 
birth, an arbitrary time limit set by the medical center on how long the 
newborns would be eligible to be considered as organ donors. But no organs were 
procured. 
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the failure to harvest organs to a number of factors, 
such as a lack of suitable recipients and "the fear of transplantation centers 
that they would become involved in the controversy over donation of 
anencephalic organs, potentially jeopardizing their transplantation programs." 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 12 infants were given intensive care from birth and six received 
intensive care when signs of imminent death developed. The researchers found 
that when life support was provided from birth, the function of the heart, 
liver and other organs was maintained but brain death was less likely to occur. 
When life support was delayed until death was imminent, brain death was more 
likely to occur but the organs deteriorated and were no longer suitable for 
transplantation.

REVITALIZED SOVIET PARLIAMENT: 'NEW, REAL POWER' THAT CAN'T BE IGNORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It surprised Western cynics, occasionally traumatized Communist Party officials 
and provided some of the best late-night television entertainment seen here in 
a long time. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, the just concluded premiere session of the revitalized 
national legislature served notice that after decades of being run exclusively 
from the top down, the system of government here has undergone a fundamental 
change. 
</P>
<P>
No one is likely to mistake the Congress of People's Deputies for the 
comparatively unfettered U.S. Congress or the British Parliament. But neither 
is there any comparison of the new Supreme Soviet with its predecessor, whose 
deputies silently raised their hands in such unanimous compliance to the 
party's every whim that it set the standard for the term "rubber-stamp 
parliament." 
</P>
<P>
"A new, real power has emerged," Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, premier and member of the 
Communist Party Politburo, told senior party leaders recently, "and we cannot 
ignore the fact." 
</P>
<P>
Listening to weeks of harsh parliamentary criticism of the government's 
shortcomings had taught him "the meaning of the word catharsis," Ryzhkov said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the restructured Parliament has already shown itself to be so 
aggressive that the mechanisms by which the party traditionally controlled 
virtually every aspect of Soviet public life "have become suspended in air." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, head of the KGB, the feared security agency, 
had described his grilling by lawmakers as "the most difficult examination of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
The revitalized Parliament emerged last spring in a highly complex voting 
procedure that for the first time forced a majority of the candidates to face 
genuine competition. About 85% of those elected were members of the Communist 
Party, but the difference now is that most are beholden as much to their 
constituents as to the party. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,250 Congress members, who were convened in late May for the first of two 
scheduled sessions a year, subsequently elected from among themselves a Supreme 
Soviet of 542 members that serves as the full-time Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a body that has emerged very quickly into a prominent role," a senior 
Western diplomat said, "and it's a lot less conservative than many people 
thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet quickly established a precedent by rejecting a dozen of 
Ryzhkov's nominees for ministerial posts, effectively making the government 
accountable to the public rather than the party for the first time since the 
earliest days of the Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred deputies even formed the first organized parliamentary 
opposition group that has existed here in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary sessions, televised live during the initial meeting and 
selectively -- on a delayed basis and late at night -- during a six-week 
session of the Supreme Soviet, gave millions of ordinary citizens their first 
heady taste of genuine political debate. 
</P>
<P>
During the session, some factories reported that up to 20% of their employees 
were absent, apparently staying home to watch the debate on television. While 
the switch to delayed coverage at night helped, it did not solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up Until 2 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry," a Moscow woman apologized to her employer when she showed up late 
for work one recent morning. She and her husband had got so absorbed in a 
lively televised parliamentary debate over economic independence for the Baltic 
republics that they were up until 2 a.m., she said sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
According to Anatoly Lukyanov, first deputy president of the Supreme Soviet, 
195 hours of proceedings were shown on television in a little over two months, 
making witnesses of millions of ordinary citizens as the deputies boldly 
attacked one sacred cow after another. 
</P>
<P>
The televised debates spilled over into the streets, where long-apathetic 
Russians could suddenly be overheard talking politics on park benches and in 
shopping queues. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary debate and the public mood appeared to feed on each other. The 
link was most obvious during last month's coal mine strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The miners, many analysts believe, were emboldened by the televised proceedings 
to protest what they saw as a system deaf to their needs. And the strikes 
triggered an extraordinary special parliamentary session that turned into a 
virtual declaration of no confidence in party and government officials at all 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
While clearly interested in its work, the general public is far from 
enthusiastic about the results it has seen from the Supreme Soviet so far, 
according to a weekend poll conducted by the Sociology Institute of the Soviet 
Academy of Sciences and published in the newspaper Evening Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
While 70% of Muscovites responding to the survey said the Parliament was more 
or less democratic, 39% complained that all the deputies did was talk. Only 6% 
described the revitalized legislature as a major step in political reform. 
</P>
<P>
A writer asked rhetorically in the latest issue of the weekly New Times: 
"Really, just what are we expecting from the new Supreme Soviet, that it 
clothe, feed, and provide better medicine for us? No one seems to be saying so 
directly, but in many irritated comments one can see these unfulfilled 
expectations: 'We are sick of the empty shops, we must spend weeks to get even 
simple items, and meanwhile you are taking a full week to discuss some new 
minister!' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than Just Talk 
</P>
<P>
It may not have fulfilled some of the people's more pressing desires, but the 
revitalized Parliament did prove itself capable of more than just talk. 
</P>
<P>
It overrode the government on the language of a new law on political dissent, 
sharply narrowing its application and easing the penalties for violators. It 
reduced the maximum tax rates on cooperative businesses, giving them a new 
lease on life after an administrative backlash that had threatened to destroy 
them. It ignored the wishes of the minister of defense to permit draft 
exemptions for students. And it more than doubled the minimum pension level, 
overriding a government plan to raise the smallest pensions by only one-third. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev described himself in a recent Radio 
Moscow interview as "tremendously satisfied" with the new arrangement, which he 
described as having laid the groundwork for a genuine separation of powers 
between the party and popularly elected soviets, or councils, at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev promised even more dramatic progress at the Supreme Soviet's next 
session, and added: "This is why I think that now no one will dare say that 
perestroika (restructuring) can stop, come to a standstill. Now we can already 
speak of perestroika's irreversibility, although this does not mean that it 
will proceed smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
A key test will be elections scheduled no later than next spring for local and 
republic-level soviets, Lukyanov said. The main challenge now, he said, is not 
so much agreeing at the top on what needs to be done, but implementing 
decisions down through the system. 
</P>
<P>
The process "will be largely assisted by renovation of cadres to be achieved 
during the coming local and republic elections," Lukyanov said. 
</P>
<P>
A problem in the meantime, a senior Western analyst noted, is that the party 
"is losing credibility and power faster than new institutions are developing." 
</P>
<P>
This view was buttressed by the poll published in Evening Moscow, which found 
69% of respondents agreeing that the party had lost prestige in the last year. 
More than 75% said that the party's constitutional "leading role" in Soviet 
society should be modified, and more than 50% said the provision should be 
dropped from the constitution.

RUSSIANS IN ESTONIA PROTEST POWER SHIFT

The Russian minority in the Baltic republic of Estonia went on the offensive 
Wednesday with scattered strikes at factories and shipyards, protesting efforts 
by Estonian activists to sever the republic politically and economically from 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The action demonstrated the growing anger of the Russians, who have held the 
reins of power in the Soviet Union ever since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution but 
who have been criticized by many of the country's more than 100 ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than 25% of Estonia's population of 1.5 million is Russian and 
about 65% is Estonian. The rest are other ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Russians fear that they will lose their rights in Estonia or even 
be forced to leave the republic by radical Estonian nationalists. Wednesday's 
strike was the second by Russians in the republic in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been killed in ethnic violence in the Soviet Union in 
recent months, making the problem one of the toughest faced by President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Protests have not turned violent in Estonia, one of the smallest of the Soviet 
Union's 15 republics. But Estonians have been among the most outspoken of the 
ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union in demanding independence from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian nationalist movement, the Popular Front, won a major victory last 
month when the Soviet Parliament decided to grant greater economic freedom to 
Estonia and the other two republics on the Baltic Sea, Latvia and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Want to Secede 
</P>
<P>
However, economic freedom is not enough for many Estonian activists, who have 
called for outright secession from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the republic's legislature adopted resolutions symbolically making 
state property the property of Estonia rather than the Soviet Union and calling 
for a new "treaty of union" with Moscow based on "principles of parity." 
</P>
<P>
The Russians who went on strike Wednesday were angered by a law passed Tuesday 
by the republic's legislature that would effectively bar many Russian workers 
living in Estonia from voting in local elections scheduled for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The new election law requires a minimum of two years' residency in one district 
or five in the republic to vote in republic elections, and five years' 
residency in a district or 10 in the republic to run for office. It was passed 
by a vote of 194 to 36. Most of the legislators opposing the law are Russians. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Russians in the republic, who moved to Estonia to take jobs in 
factories and shipyards, are recent arrivals and would be disenfranchised by 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian strikers were also demonstrating against a new law that makes 
Estonian rather than Russian the republic's official language. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes were reported in several of the republic's factories and shipyards. 
They also affected public transport in the capital of Tallinn, according to 
Yuri Rudyak, a member of the Russian-speaking group Inter-Movement, which was 
formed to defend the interests of native Russians. The group says it has 90,000 
members in Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
In late July, several thousand non-Estonians walked off their jobs at factories 
in Tallinn, returning to work only when the Estonian government agreed to set 
up a committee to ensure that the interests of non-Estonians would be 
protected.

The "Lone Star State" proved to be the overwhelming favorite in a newspaper 
poll on what should go on Texas license plates, outstripping "The Bank Failure 
State" and "Pinhead Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 7,636 ballots submitted by readers in the Austin American-Statesman 
Poll, 6,515 chose "Lone Star State," 387 said keep the plates the way they are 
-- with no slogan -- and 613 had their own suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Only 121 chose "The Friendship State," which was selected by the Texas Highway 
Commission and ignited the debate. Other suggestions included "Don't Mess With 
Texas," "Texas, the Insolvent State," "Yankee Go Home" and "Gateway to New 
Mexico."

A Northwest Airlines DC-10 en route from Los Angeles to Minneapolis on 
Wednesday made an emergency landing in Denver after the jet's No. 2 engine 
apparently began breaking up and the pilot shut it down, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 308, carrying 256 people, landed at Stapleton International Airport 
Wednesday about 6:30 p.m. without incident or injury, according to Richard 
Boulware, a spokesman at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"They experienced a severe vibration from the No. 2 engine, (and) as a 
precautionary measure, they elected to make an unscheduled landing in Denver," 
said Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen from the Minneapolis area, where the 
airline is based. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 engine of a DC-10 also is the focus of an investigation into the 
disaster of United Airlines Flight 232 last month. The flight from Denver was 
over Iowa when the engine apparently disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
Boulware, who observed the damage to the aircraft after it landed Wednesday 
night, said there were "multiple shrapnel-like holes in the outer cowling" of 
the No. 2 engine, which on a DC-10 is mounted in the vertical stabilizer at the 
tail of the aircraft. The other two engines are mounted under the wings. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the holes was big enough I could have stuck my hand through," he said.

A youth league coach, apparently in a rage, shot and critically wounded his 
16-year-old star pitcher after she jumped from his pickup and then killed 
himself, deputies and the girl's father said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists, including a Placer County sheriff's deputy, witnessed the shootings 
Tuesday evening on Interstate 80. They said they stopped to help the girl at 
the roadside, then saw the pickup return, the driver walk over to the group, 
pull out a large-caliber handgun, shoot the girl and then himself. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Placer County Sheriff's Department identified the dead 
man as Jesse Aguilar, 42, of North Highlands. The girl, identified by her 
father as Suzanne Jacobs of North Highlands, was in critical but stable 
condition at University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Jacobs said his daughter, coached by Aguilar, had played softball for six 
years. He said Aguilar picked up his daughter at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday to go to a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said that his daughter had no social life except for her softball team 
and her coach and his family but that this summer had gotten a job and acquired 
a new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said that Aguilar was obsessed with his daughter but that he was 
convinced there was nothing sexual and said he trusted Aguilar. But he said 
Aguilar had been following his daughter around for the last few days and had 
tried to obtain the address of her new friend. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said deputies were waiting for the girl to regain consciousness to talk 
to her to discover a motive for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told deputies that the pickup was traveling at 55 m.p.h. in the right 
eastbound lane when the girl jumped out.

DEUKMEJIAN MOROCCO-BOUND FOR A PARTY

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, hardly anyone's definition of a party boy, will shuck 
convention and join the jet set next week for a high-power, celebrity studded 
birthday celebration in Tangier for publisher Malcolm Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
A bit out of the ordinary for the strait-laced governor who celebrates 
political victories with a heaping bowl of jamoca almond fudge ice cream, you 
may wonder? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a bit, conceded press secretary Kevin Brett. He confirmed that 
Deukmejian and his wife, Gloria, will join about 800 special friends Aug. 19 to 
celebrate Forbes' 70th birthday at the magazine publisher's castle overlooking 
the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"This may not be what people normally associate with George Deukmejian," Brett 
said. But he quickly added: "They should understand it is not unlike Gov. 
Deukmejian to meet with highly visible . . . individuals in the business 
community, albeit in a social setting." 
</P>
<P>
According to a Washington Post society column, invited guests include such 
personalities as Elizabeth Taylor; Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee Iacocca; 
television's Barbara Walters and Walter Cronkite; actress Dina Merrill; 
designer Oscar de la Renta; Fiat chairman Giovanni Agnelli; Washington Post 
chairman Katherine Graham; comedienne Joan Rivers and former Treasury Secretary 
W. Michael Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and the governor of Rhode Island, Ed DiPrete, are believed to be the 
only two political officeholders to attend, Brett said. He noted that the 
Deukmejians' costs, including round-trip chartered jet fare from New York to 
Morocco, will be paid by Forbes and reported on the governor's legally required 
disclosure of gifts report. 
</P>
<P>
Brett said Deukmejian, who is accompanied at virtually every function by at 
least one staff aide, would not have office assistants on this trip. "I cannot 
think of a similar situation where that has occurred," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
The press secretary refused to discuss how Deukmejian's name got on the guest 
list, but he said "there is a familiarity with Gov. Deukmejian by Malcolm 
Forbes himself." He noted that the governor's picture was on the cover of 
Forbes magazine in 1984 and the publication printed a story about his program 
to balance the state budget. Since then, the governor has met with the 
magazine's staff, Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
Brett said the Morocco trip will be sandwiched between long-scheduled official 
state business conferences Deukmejian will hold with bankers, investors and 
corporate executives in New York Aug. 16-22. 
</P>
<P>
He said Deukmejian, as he has in the past, would meet with the finance 
executives to discuss the fiscal condition of California and seek to attract 
more investment in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian will fly to New York on Wednesday, meet with manufacturing 
executives on Thursday, fly to Morocco on Friday, party on Saturday, return to 
New York on Sunday, hold more conferences on Monday and return to California on 
Tuesday.

WOMAN WHO ABANDONED BABY ON JET GETS 6 MONTHS

<P>
A woman who abandoned her newborn daughter under the lavatory sink of a 
jetliner bound from Newark, N.J., to San Francisco last year was sentenced 
Wednesday to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Christina LoCasto, 25, of New York City broke into tears when San Mateo County 
Superior Court Judge Margaret Kemp turned down a plea from LoCasto's attorney 
for a lesser punishment. The judge said that although LoCasto had no criminal 
record, her actions were irresponsible and could have led to her child's death. 
</P>
<P>
LoCasto pleaded no contest on May 25 to one count of felony child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain, LoCasto was given the jail term plus three years' 
probation and fines of about $700. She could have served up to six years if 
given the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
LoCasto, who is expecting a fourth child in November, asked that she serve her 
time in a county jail close to her home on Staten Island. Authorities were 
considering the request. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, Christina LoCasto had become pregnant and, 
because of fears that her husband would disapprove, kept the news secret. On 
July 13, 1988, the LoCasto family, including two older daughters, boarded a 
United Air Lines flight at Newark Airport, heading for a vacation in 
California. Before the DC-10 took off, LoCasto secretly gave birth, stuffed the 
baby under a lavatory sink and returned to her seat. Flight attendants closed 
off the restroom because they believed that someone had gotten ill. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the plane landed at San Francisco International Airport, members 
of a cleaning crew that went aboard heard a noise and discovered the infant in 
a pile of blood-soaked towels. 
</P>
<P>
"The airline worker just happened to hear a 'squeak-squeak,' " San Mateo County 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Steven Wagstaffe said. "If he hadn't heard that, that 
baby would have died." 
</P>
<P>
LoCasto turned herself in the next day. The child, named Alyssa, is now in the 
custody of her paternal grandparents on Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
Although LoCasto refused to comment publicly on her reasons for deserting the 
child, her husband has said the couple were having marital problems at the 
time. Wagstaffe said he believes that these problems caused LoCasto to fear 
telling her husband about the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know why she did this," he said. "I guess she decided her life 
with her husband outweighed that of her child." Her attorney, Dick Bennett, 
refused to comment, saying LoCasto wanted to keep the details of the situation 
private. 
</P>
<P>
"She's gained a great amount of self-confidence and parenting skills since that 
time," Bennett said. Both LoCastos have been seeing counselors since last 
year's incident, and have begun proceedings to regain custody of Alyssa, which 
could come within the next six weeks, he said.

PAC BELL, STRIKING UNION MAKE NO PROGRESS IN TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No progress was reported Wednesday in informal talks in Oakland between Pacific 
Bell and representatives of 42,000 striking telephone workers in the fourth day 
of a work stoppage that also involves two regional telephone companies on the 
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
As the strike continued, tensions were high outside phone company offices. In 
one incident, a Communications Workers of America shop steward, Shari 
Underwood, was treated for cuts and bruises and released from a Van Nuys 
hospital Wednesday after being hit by a car while she picketed at a Pacific 
Bell building on Van Nuys Boulevard. Union officials said they did not know the 
identity of the driver of the car and police were unable to provide details. It 
was not known if the incident was related to the strike. 
</P>
<P>
And in New York and Massachusetts on Wednesday, police arrested 22 striking 
telephone workers on suspicion of crimes ranging from disorderly conduct and 
resisting arrest to failing to obey a policeman's order to move. 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, CWA officials said their negotiators were preparing a response 
to a modified contract offer by Bell Atlantic, one of the struck companies. 
Talks may resume today. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides in the third strike, involving New York-based NYNEX Corp., which 
serves the Northeast, have not talked since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in all three strikes are wages and company proposals to require 
employees to pay for a greater share of health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The strikes, which began Sunday, involve 157,000 workers and affect phone 
customers in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Workers at three other 
regional phone companies are threatening to strike this weekend if contracts 
are not signed. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the AFL-CIO Executive Council passed a resolution urging the 
public, union members and their families "to advise the local subsidiaries of 
Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Telesis (the parent company of Pacific Bell) 
that they will defer payment of their telephone bills until the strikes are 
settled." 
</P>
<P>
The council for the 15 million-member AFL-CIO supported the non-payment 
strategy as a tactic to deal with the high degree of automation in the 
telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of automation, company managers filling in for striking 
employees have been barely able to keep pace with the flood of 
directory-assistance calls.

Flying Tiger Pilots Union Upheld: The National Mediation Board rejected a bid 
by Federal Express to decertify the union that represents 933 former Flying 
Tiger Line pilots. The board did decertify Flying Tiger's machinists' union, 
however. Federal Express acquired Los Angeles-based Tiger International, the 
parent of Flying Tiger Line, last December. Federal Express' 1,064 pilots 
aren't members of any union. A spokesman for Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal 
Express said the ruling means that the Air Line Pilots Assn. may continue to 
represent ex-Tiger pilots until pilots from Federal Express and Flying Tiger 
jointly vote on union representation this fall.

NCNB BUYOUT OF U.S. SHARE IN TEXAS BANK COMES EARLY

NCNB Corp. on Wednesday bought out the federal government's 51% interest in 
NCNB Texas National Bank, completing the $1.32-billion purchase of the 
institution created in the nation's costliest bank failure. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout, announced 10 days ago, comes four years ahead of a timetable 
established last year when NCNB was selected to manage the 40 failed banks of 
First RepublicBank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In that deal, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB also got a five-year option to buy all 
of Texas' largest bank holding company, which has $27.9 billion in assets. NCNB 
changed the company's name to NCNB Texas at that time. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquisition, NCNB becomes the nation's ninth-largest commercial bank, 
with about $60 billion in assets and $43.2 billion in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
NCNB paid $210 million for a 20% share of NCNB Texas on Nov. 22, then 
accelerated its plans, paying $310 million for an additional 29% on April 28 
and $800 million for the remaining shares Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The price gives a $270-million profit to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
which provided $840 million of the initial recapitalization of First 
RepublicBank. FDIC is also financing part of Wednesday's purchase through $320 
million in a one-year, interest-bearing note. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the government has estimated that the First RepublicBank rescue will 
cost $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Improved profits at the Texas institution led to NCNB's decision to move up its 
purchase, the bank said last month. NCNB Texas earned $63.1 million in the 
second quarter, with $28.8 million going to NCNB Corp.

Cummins Engine Co., fighting the latest potential takeover threat against the 
diesel engine maker, said Wednesday that it has amended its "poison pill" 
defense, making its shareholder rights plan easier to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Cummins directors may grant shareholders the right to purchase 
new shares for $1 each if someone acquires 15% of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly, the rights plan, which could make it prohibitively expensive for a 
raider to acquire Cummins, could not be exercised until an investor held 25% of 
the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the Hong Kong-based investment company Industrial Equity 
(Pacific) Ltd. said it had acquired 10% of Columbus, Ind.-based Cummins. 
</P>
<P>
Although the group said it purchased the holding for investment purposes only, 
Wall Street analysts said they considered the stock "in play" as a potential 
takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
On July 17, descendants of Cummins' founding family acted to preserve the 
company's independence by paying a $5-million premium for a nearly 10% stake 
held by Hanson PLC, the acquisitive British conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
The move was considered unusual because Hanson had not indicated any takeover 
intentions, and the company's management had not sought the family's 
assistance.

Bumper Crops Expected: The first reliable estimate of the size of this year's 
harvest, to be released today by the Agriculture Department, is expected to 
project a bumper corn, soybean and wheat crop. Officials expect a big jump in 
output from last year's drought-hit levels because of better weather in key 
Midwestern states. The report is expected to project soybean production at 1.90 
billion to 2.01 billion bushels, corn at 7.29 billion to 7.76 billion bushels 
and wheat no lower than 1.95 billion bushels.

FOR MANY FIRMS, IT'S NOT ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

If history is any kind of teacher, the key to success in running a large, 
publicly owned family business often is to let someone else do it. 
</P>
<P>
"The test of history has shown that it is very dangerous for a family to run a 
big firm," said Alfred Chandler, retired professor of business history at 
Harvard University's business school. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Frederick A. Wang this week as president of Wang 
Laboratories Inc. may be a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Laboratories, founded by Frederick's father, An Wang, until recently had 
phenomenal success, growing into a $3-billion company largely on the success of 
its word processors. 
</P>
<P>
But keeping family members running the business may no longer be possible as 
the company struggles to fend off lenders, boost a sagging stock price and 
shore up mounting losses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Pleased 
</P>
<P>
Chandler points out that some of the best names in business are those of 
prestigious families such as the Rockefellers and Du Ponts who preserved their 
fortunes by installing well-paid professional managers while keeping tight 
control over their companies through stock holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the classic case of a dynasty losing control of a company is Ford Motor 
Co., which eventually turned the reins over from Henry Ford II to Philip 
Caldwell in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, family members such as Edsel Ford II and William Clay Ford Jr. have 
made clear their displeasure with the lack of family in top company posts. 
</P>
<P>
Many family-owned businesses, however, fight to retain their dynasties, often 
sparking dissension among other family members or unhappiness among board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
In entrepreneurial companies such as Wang, it often is impossible for a son or 
daughter to replicate the success of the founder. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency is to look at Fred Wang and wonder why he isn't able to solve the 
company's problems or have the same vision his father had," said Abraham 
Zeleznik, a professor at Harvard University Business School. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Wang might take comfort in remembering the plight of Robert W. 
Sarnoff, who proved unable to duplicate the success of a highly inventive 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Sarnoff was ousted as chief executive of RCA by the company's board in 1975, 
ending a family reign that started with his father David 45 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, it was assumed that Sarnoff's removal was due to a failed effort 
in computers and his inability to repeat his father's successful gamble in the 
color television market. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in family succession say nepotism does not have to kill a company and 
many succeed through generations of family management -- particularly if they 
are not publicly held. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crap shoot," said Robert Dewar, professor of organizational behavior at 
Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. "There have 
been tremendous successes, and there are mega-disasters where you can't get the 
family out of there."

A nationwide video rental chain agreed not to photocopy instruction manuals for 
Nintendo games that its stores were renting out, according to court papers 
filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo of America of Redmond, Wash., last week sued the chain, Blockbuster 
Entertainment Corp. of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., charging copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo said the chain of 600 stores was frequently copying the booklets and 
charging renters a fee if the manuals were lost. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese video game company submitted six inches of legal papers with its 
complaint, most of them booklets and copies. The lawsuit specifically named 
four stores in New Jersey, allowing the case to be filed here. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo charged that Blockbuster ignored its request in a July 31 letter to 
stop the practice. In a statement released Wednesday by Blockbuster, the chain 
said it had already told its managers not to copy the manuals. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to a court order filed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge 
Alfred M. Wolin. The order also requires Blockbuster within five days to send a 
letter drafted by Nintendo's lawyers warning its franchises and managers not to 
copy manuals. 
</P>

Nintendo of America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo Co. of Japan.

FORD CONSIDERS EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE WITH MAZDA

<P>
Ford Motor Co. is studying a joint venture to produce vehicles in Europe with 
its Japanese partner Mazda Motor Corp., a top Ford official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a University of Michigan automotive seminar, Ford 
Executive Vice President Philip Benton also denied trade publication reports 
that the auto maker has killed its PN38 truck program, an ambitious plan of new 
trucks and mini-vans for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In the first direct public comments by a Ford executive on the program, Benton 
said it has not been canceled but has been modified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Construction Dates 
</P>
<P>
Ford owns about 25% of Mazda, in what is considered the most successful 
partnership between a U.S. and Japanese auto maker. Mazda builds the Ford Probe 
at its Flat Rock, Mich., plant, and its 323 subcompact provides the base for 
the Mercury Tracer, built by Ford in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at how we can best get together in Europe," Benton said of the 
potential venture. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda officials said earlier this year that they were holding talks with Ford 
on a European venture, but Ford did not confirm the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Benton said any venture would require an expansion of Ford's already tight 
production capacity situation in Europe. "We would have to find means to expand 
capacity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ford has not built a U.S. plant since its Kentucky truck facility 
opened in 1969, Benton also said Ford has not ruled out the possibility of 
building new production centers in the United States during the 1990s. He said 
the company has decided that new plants are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only a question of time," Benton said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he would not say exactly when these plants will be built. "When does 
tomorrow come? I don't have the foggiest idea." 
</P>
<P>
The first vehicles in Ford's PN38 program were expected to be introduced in the 
early 1990s. The program involves a new series of full-sized trucks, mini-vans 
and sport utility vehicles and its importance had been compared by some 
analysts to the auto maker's Taurus and Sable car development program. 
</P>
<P>
Some reports had said the recent softening in U.S. auto sales was responsible 
for the program being killed. Ford's U.S. auto sales are down about 2% this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not canceled PN38. We have changed its complexion," Benton said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the project would have involved developing new engines and 
transmissions, and Ford is already strapped for capacity in those components. 
The revised plan, Benton said, will allow Ford to use existing engines and 
transmissions.

The University of Southern California is wiring itself for the 21st Century as 
a crew from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph installs a new 
telecommunications nerve center. The so-called Integrated Services Digital 
Network, or ISDN, will enable faculty and researchers to communicate with 
colleagues around the world over a system that carries voice, pictures and 
computer data simultaneously over the same telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
"USC is part of a worldwide research community," said spokesman Hugh Kelley. 
"We have a tremendous interaction with other countries and other organizations 
worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Under a $23-million contract, AT&amp;T also is delivering 10,000 telephone sets 
(3,000 of them ISDN-compatible), a network management system, a microwave radio 
link, fiber-optic and coaxial cables and three equipment rooms as well as 
maintenance service. 
</P>
<P>
When the new system starts operating in the fall, USC will join the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and North Carolina's Duke University as 
the only U.S. institutions of higher learning with ISDN technology. BRUCE

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE NEED FOR TRAINING IS GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence J. Magid, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The biggest investment associated with using a PC is neither the hardware nor 
the software -- it's what I call brainware. Learning to use a computer and 
software takes time, patience and money. Businessland, one of the nation's 
largest computer retailers, estimates that American businesses spend $800 
million a year for training workers on PCs. 
</P>
<P>
The size of that market was apparently the reason behind Businessland's 
announcement on Aug. 1 that it was creating a new division to expand its 
training operations. The San Jose-based company, which claims to have trained 
500,000 computer users since 1982, currently offers 90 courses at 130 training 
centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
At first the Businessland announcement took me by surprise. Why would a 
computer retailer beef up its training staff just as the computer industry is 
starting to deliver machines and software packages that are easier to use? 
</P>
<P>
I used to be in the training business myself and once worried that the need for 
training would diminish as easy-to-use computers began to catch on. Apple 
Computer started the trend in 1984 when it unveiled the Macintosh. IBM and 
Microsoft followed in 1987 by announcing the Operating System/2, which comes 
with a user interface called Presentation Manager that, like the Macintosh, 
makes programs easier to use. It also establishes a standard way of using 
software, making it easier to learn new programs once you've mastered some 
basic concepts. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Steven P. Jobs, co-founder of Apple, last year announced Next, 
yet another easy-to-use computer. Hewlett-Packard, AT&amp;T, Tandy and several 
other companies also have released or at least demonstrated machines and 
software packages specifically designed to make our lives easier. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, though, all of this new hardware and software is adding to computer 
users' confusion and in all likelihood is part of the reason for the increased 
demand for training. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Amstutz, Businessland's director of customer training, expects the 
computer training market to grow at an annual rate of more than 10% over the 
next three years. Amstutz says "increasing complexity, diversity and pace of 
change in office computing" will continue to stimulate the demand for training. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, computers are getting more complicated. In the old days there were a 
handful of hardware companies and a finite number of programs. Today there are 
hundreds of PC makers and tens of thousands of programs. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, computers are no longer islands unto themselves. Increasingly, 
office workers are linking their computers to form local area networks, or 
LANS. Often these LANS are mixtures of different types of machines, including 
IBM PCs, IBM compatibles, Apple Macintoshes, workstations running the UNIX 
operating system as well as minicomputers and mainframes. 
</P>
<P>
Linking computers into networks makes it easier for people in an office to 
share information, but it also creates problems. Macintosh users must now worry 
if their documents are compatible with those created on IBM PCs. IBM users need 
to be concerned if their machines have enough memory to remain connected to the 
network while running their application programs. Networks have spawned a whole 
new career. Now there are training courses for people who want to become 
full-time "network administrators." 
</P>
<P>
Life is getting more complicated even for users who aren't on a network. In the 
mid-1980s, people worried about whether they should buy a monochrome or 
graphics display. Now users of IBM PCs and compatible machines have to choose 
among more than six competing display standards. 
</P>
<P>
Computer users have always been concerned about whether their machines had 
enough memory to run the latest software. But now they need to worry about what 
kind of memory they're using. All IBM PCs are equipped with what is called 
"conventional memory," but now there is also extended memory and expanded 
memory. Some programs just won't work unless you have the right type of memory 
chips or plug-in memory board. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called user-friendly Macintosh is part of the problem, too. Apple now 
ships five different models: the Mac Plus, Mac SE, Mac II, Mac IIx and Mac IIcx 
and, soon, there will be a laptop Mac. There are different styles and sizes of 
monitors and a host of add-on devices. Although the Mac doesn't have different 
types of memory, users do need to be concerned about whether the chips they buy 
are the right speed for their Mac's central processing unit. 
</P>
<P>
Most training courses focus on particular software programs despite the effort 
by software companies to make programs easier to use by adding pull-down menus 
and plenty of help screens. But all that cannot take the place of hands-on 
training. Even if you're familiar with the basic way a program works, you 
probably don't know how to use all of its features. Businessland spokeswoman 
Beverly Bird estimates that most users take advantage of only a small 
percentage of the features built into their PCs and software. 
</P>
<P>
And computer training isn't a one-shot deal. Some students come back regularly 
to learn different programs. Many training centers offer beginning, 
intermediate and advanced courses for each software program. And then there are 
the new versions. 
</P>
<P>
Word-processing programs, such as WordStar and WordPerfect, have grown 
enormously, adding hundreds of features compared to early versions. The new 
Lotus 1-2-3 (Release 3) has the same look and feel of the older version. But if 
you want to take advantage of the program's many new features, you'll have to 
go back to school or spend hours studying the manuals. 
</P>
<P>
Desktop publishing and laser printers have drawn people to classrooms to learn 
not only about new equipment and software but to take a crash course on page 
design, layout and typesetting. Until a few years ago, you were lucky if your 
computer's printer could handle bold and italics. Today, anyone with a laser 
printer can select from hundreds of optional typefaces, or fonts, in a variety 
of sizes and styles. 
</P>
<P>
Classroom training isn't the only option. There are books, video tapes, audio 
tapes and computer programs that teach you how to use other programs. There is 
even a magazine dedicated to computer training. Data Training goes out free to 
people in data processing or computer training. Others can subscribe for $36 a 
year (two issues). Contact Weingarten Publications, 38 Chauncy St., Boston, MA 
02111-2369. Phone: (617) 542-0146. 
</P>
<P>
If you are interested in a class, check with your local computer dealers, 
community colleges and university extension services. You can also look in the 
yellow pages under "training" and "computer training" to find companies that 
are not affiliated with dealers or schools. Some software companies also 
publish lists of training centers, most of which pay a fee for the listing. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland's charges are typical of private training companies: $125 for a 
basic four-hour class or about $225 for a full-day class. Classes about local 
area networks cost $495 per day.

Stock prices turned downward near the close of a turbulent session Wednesday, 
running into some resistance at or near record highs. 
</P>
<P>
Airline stocks extended their recent runaway rise, prompted by a bid for UAL 
Corp., and numerous other stocks jumped around in takeover-related trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points in early trading, 
closed with a 13.09 loss at 2,686.08.

The Dow has come within striking distance of the closing peak of 2,722.42 it

In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 12.3

</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices tumbled after a federal refinancing auction that analysts termed 
disappointing and a key interest rate shot higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was off 23/32 point, or $7.19 per $1,000 
face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, rose to 8.14% from 
8.08% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit market strategists said a sharp rise in the federal funds rate, the 
interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, indicated the 
Federal Reserve did not plan to ease interest rates for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
The rate was quoted at 9.50%, up from 8.935% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was the first time the funds rate, a key interest rate 
barometer since it is set daily by the market, had broken 9% in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The high rate came on a settlement day, when banks have to settle reserve 
requirements with the Fed and often must borrow large amounts. The federal 
funds rate is often unstable on settlement days. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities Co. International 
Inc., said the Fed did nothing to halt the upward drift of the rate, indicating 
it did not plan to ease interest rates any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues were 1/16 point to 5/32 lower, intermediate maturities ranged 
from 3/16 point to 1/2 point lower, and long-term issues were down 17/32 point 
to 21/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial-information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, slumped 3.19 to 1,184.17. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials also lost ground. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.16 to 330.83. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.19% as the discount edged down 8 
basis points to 8.01%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.02% as the discount 
fell 6 basis points to 7.62%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.01% as the 
discount fell 1 basis point to 7.55%. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar turned narrowly mixed against key foreign currencies in sluggish 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were also mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold 
bullion for current delivery rose to $366.90 an ounce from $366.20 late 
Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $366 
an ounce, up $1.70. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said concerns of slow economic growth brought a soft tone to 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve released its regular bank survey of economic conditions, 
known as its "beige book," on Wednesday, and that showed the economy was still 
growing but at a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 0.40 yen to a closing 138.85 yen. It traded at 139.13 yen in London and at 
138.945 yen in New York, up from 138.865. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the British pound in London. The pound fell to $1.6170 
from $1.6250 late Tuesday. Sterling fetched $1.6625 in New York, up from 
$1.6255. 
</P>
<P>
Gold traded at a bid price of $365.75 an ounce in London, up from $365.45 late 
Tuesday. In Zurich gold closed at a bid price of $365 an ounce, down from 
$365.85. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices headed lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current 
delivery fell to $5.155 an ounce from $5.156. Silver was bid at $5.15 an ounce 
in London, down 1 cent. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Corn futures were lower, but soybeans and wheat prices finished higher as 
traders hewed to narrow ranges in advance of a much-anticipated U.S. Department 
of Agriculture survey of crop production for the year. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, sugar futures surged on rumors that India was in the market 
for as many as 300,000 tons; heating oil led a modest run-up in the petroleum 
futures complex, and frozen pork belly prices continued sliding in the face of 
historically high inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Corn came under pressure with the opening bell at the Chicago Board of Trade 
because of the unusually high crop production estimate -- 7.72 billion bushels 
-- released after the close of trading Tuesday by influential private 
forecaster Conrad Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
Although Leslie's forecast for soybeans was high as well -- 1.95 billion 
bushels -- most traders apparently felt that was discounted during the late 
wave of selling Tuesday that dragged November soybeans to yet another contract 
low. 
</P>
<P>
Traders tested the contract low at $5.62 again early Wednesday. After support 
held above that mark, many traders squared up their positions and headed to the 
sidelines to await today's government report. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1.5 cents to 5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
September at $3.95 a bushel; corn was 0.5 cent to 2 cents lower, with September 
at $2.23 a bushel; oats were 1.25 cents lower to unchanged, with September at 
$1.36 a bushel, and soybeans were 1.50 cents to 9 cents higher, with August at 
$5.94 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a big purchase by India, which some traders speculated may already 
have taken place, pushed sugar futures prices above 14 cents a pound at 
mid-session. 
</P>
<P>
Late profit taking helped trim the gains, however, and sugar finished 0.05 cent 
to 0.26 cent higher on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with 
October at 14.07 cents. 
</P>
<P>
An American Petroleum Institute report released after Tuesday's trading showed 
a substantial drawdown in heating oil supplies last month and that lifted the 
entire complex. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil was 9 cents to 14 cents higher at the New York Mercantile Exchange, 
with September at $18.21 a barrel; heating oil was 0.66 cent to 0.96 cent 
higher, with September at 49.43 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.14 
cent to 0.40 cent higher, with September at 50.58 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock futures were mostly lower, while pork futures were sharply lower at 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

BOMB SCARE AT RESEDA CENTER

<P>
Los Angeles police investigated a report of a possible bomb on the roof of a 
city Recreation and Parks family counseling center in Reseda this morning but 
found only a bag filled with batteries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A man in his 20s who was found on the roof of the one-story Family Service of 
Los Angeles Community Center in the 14700 block of Victory Boulevard was being 
questioned in connection with the incident. Police said they had not determined 
why he was there or whether he had placed the batteries there. The man's name 
was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Victory Boulevard was closed, and the 8 a.m. opening of the center, which 
provides a variety of financial and personal counseling programs, was delayed 
until about 10 a.m. while the incident was investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Winthrop Taylor said police received a call about 7:30 a.m from a woman who 
reported that the center was an abortion clinic and that a man was seen 
climbing onto the roof. Fran Umanski, director of the center, said the 
city-operated center does not offer any programs involving abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's bomb squad was called to the scene while road blocks 
were set up in the area.

DISGRUNTLED POSTMAN GOES ON SHOOTING SPREE; 3 SLAIN; 
</P>
<P>
ESCONDIDO GUNMAN IS BRAIN DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A disgruntled mailman today shot his wife to death, then drove to a nearby post 
office in Escondido and opened fire on fellow employees, killing two and 
wounding a third before putting the gun to his head and shooting himself. 
</P>
<P>
The rampage, which began at 7:30 a.m. on East Valley Parkway on the eastern 
edge of the northern San Diego County city, left postal workers scrambling for 
safety. When the gunfire subsided, survivors were seen exchanging hugs and 
crying quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman, identified as John Merlin Taylor, 52, of Escondido, 
apparently was prepared for a siege of the postal facility, but there was no 
indication that he was looking for a specific person or a target. 
</P>
<P>
"He fired well over a dozen rounds, and there are expended cases all over the 
floor there," Escondido Police Lt. Earl Callander said. "There is also a box of 
about 100 rounds that apparently was going to be used for reloading." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was taken to nearby Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was placed on a 
life support system and declared brain-dead shortly after 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said Taylor had been a letter carrier 
for 25 years and was nearing retirement. Taylor's boss described him as a model 
employee, "as mellow and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasing Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Police said they knew of no motive for the shootings and believed that the 
victims were shot randomly, but co-workers said Taylor had succumbed to 
increasing pressure at work. 
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, co-worker Johnny Sims recalled having a discussion with Taylor in 
which the mailman mentioned the 1986 shooting rampage at the post office in 
Edmond, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what may have happened is that we were talking about that thing that 
happened at the Oklahoma post office," said Sims, who was not at work when the 
Escondido shooting erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking about something and got around to saying, 'What if something 
happened to one of the employees that would have gotten him mad and to go 
berserk?' " Sims added. "We were just joking around." 
</P>
<P>
The Edmond shootings, which stunned the nation and is still much talked about 
by postal workers who feel that the U.S. Postal Service is insensitive to its 
employees, occurred when part-time mail carrier Patrick Sherrill massacred 14 
co-workers, wounded six others and then committed suicide. Sherrill apparently 
had been seeking revenge on his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Another co-worker, who declined to be identified, said he saw Taylor leave work 
Wednesday night. He said Taylor seemed upset at the huge volume of mail he was 
supposed to process. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was going home early because 'there's not enough mail here,' " the 
co-worker said, adding that Taylor's remark was clearly facetious because 
"there was a ton of mail there." 
</P>
<P>
The same co-worker described Taylor was a "mellow, easygoing guy" who would 
routinely get to work half an hour early and join two other employees on a 
picnic table next to the loading dock for coffee each morning. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:35 a.m., however, Taylor arrived at work and approached the same picnic 
table and shot the two co-workers with a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun, 
killing both, police said. The names of the victims were not immediately 
released by police. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Police Sgt. Blaine Bennett said Taylor then walked inside the back of 
the post office and shot a co-worker through the arm. The victim, identified as 
Paul Michael DeRisi, was taken to Palomar Memorial Hospital, where he was 
listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said another co-worker, Phyllis DeVito, injured herself when she fell 
during a mad scramble to flee the building. DeVito also was taken to the 
hospital but was expected to be released this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Post office manager Bob Henley said he was in his office when he heard shots 
and saw one employee bleeding from the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Henly said he saw Taylor walk toward him and then point a gun his way. 
</P>
<P>
He said Taylor told him: "I'm not going to shoot you" and then fired in another 
direction. Henley said he "went back in and closed my office door, and I called 
911." 
</P>
<P>
Postal worker Reginald Keith said he was in a custodial room when he heard the 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
William Karlson, who saw Taylor walking inside the building, recalled: "He 
didn't have any emotion. He was stern-faced. He walked right by me. He was 
walking toward the end of the building with the gun in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
About the same time that the shootings occurred, police received a call to go 
to Taylor's residence several blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Escondidio Police Chief Vincent Jimno said that Taylor's wife, Liz, was found 
lying in bed with her clothes on and that the covers had been pulled halfway up 
as though she had been asleep. There were initial fears that Taylor might also 
have shot his son, but a check of his home revealed that the boy was safe.

A Glendale man was burned to death in a five-car pileup that left four others 
injured this morning and closed the southbound Golden State Freeway in Valencia 
for nearly two hours, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the 41-year-old motorist who died in the 12:05 a.m. accident near 
the Lyons Avenue exit was not released pending notification of his family, the 
CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ralph Elvira said the accident occurred when the Glendale man, driving 
southbound in a Mercedes-Benz, lost control of his car and crashed into the 
freeway's center divider. 
</P>
<P>
The car rebounded into the second lane of the freeway and came to a stop. Two 
other southbound cars swerved around the Mercedes and also came to a stop, 
Elvira said. Another car could not stop in time and attempted to swerve between 
the stopped cars but hit all three, knocking one of them into a fifth car that 
was driving by. 
</P>
<P>
The impact caused the Mercedes to burst into flames, and its driver was burned 
to death, Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
All southbound lanes of the freeway were closed while the fire was put out and 
the wreckaged was cleared. Elvira said traffic backed up two miles before the 
freeway was reopened shortly before 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Three drivers and a passenger from the other cars involved in the accident were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Weeks, 25, of Fresno was in critical condition at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Newhall, and Jerry Gragnani, 40, of Fresno was in stable 
condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnani's passenger, Anna Sandoval, 34, of Fresno was treated and released 
from Holy Cross, and Francisco Gutierrez, 49, of San Fernando was treated at 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia for minor injuries, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation of the accident is continuing, Elvira said.

Los Angeles lawyer and author Gerald Goldfarb was shot to death in a Newport 
Beach townhouse after he argued with a woman who then shot herself in the 
stomach, authorities said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Ayers, 45, of Newport Beach critically wounded herself after she 
allegedly fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun she had purchased only hours 
before the shooting Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb died from multiple wounds, and Ayers underwent surgery for a wound to 
the abdomen and is listed in critical condition today at Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. Her bail was set at $250,000, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb, 49, a Harvard Law School graduate, was a monthly columnist for the 
Whole Life Times. Robert Hertzberg, a friend, said that Goldfarb had co-written 
a book, "Winning With Your Lawyer," and that he hosted a show on Century Cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Goldfarb and Ayers were longtime friends but would not say whether 
the relationship was romantic. Hertzberg said that Goldfarb "has been happy as 
a clam lately . . . and he was only married two months ago." 
</P>
<P>
The shotgun allegedly used still carried price tags, authorities said.

The ruling Communist Party expelled China's leading computer entrepreneur from 
its ranks today for having supported the spring pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
New China News Agency said Wan Runnan, whose computer company, the Stone Group 
Co., was nicknamed the IBM of China, was expelled from the party and also fired 
as Stone chairman and president. He fled China after the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Wan, 43, founded Stone in 1984 and built it into China's leading computer 
manufacturer and a model of Western-style management techniques. He epitomized 
the reform dream before the crackdown of private entrepreneurs turning ideas 
and know-how into cash. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Wan "plotted, fanned and directly joined in the recent . .

CONGRESSMEN CLAIM GULAGS STILL EXIST;

SOVIET CAMPS HOLD POLITICAL PRISONERS, U.S. VISITORS SAY

<P>
Two U.S. congressmen said today that their visit to a prison camp in the Ural 
Mountains convinced them that the Soviet Union is still holding political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) and Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.), who visited the 
Perm 35 labor camp and interviewed 24 prisoners, said they could not specify 
how many are being held for their political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolf said "many or most said they were political prisoners" and "we believe 
that they are." 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen also criticized the prison camp's conditions, saying inmates 
complained of the cold and isolation and the few visits from relatives that are 
allowed. Perm 35 is known for housing and mistreating Soviet dissidents, once 
including well-known human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who now lives in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to close the camp down," Wolf said. "It's a terrible place, and it 
ought not to exist." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf and Smith said the camp clearly was spruced up for their arrival, with 
fresh paint on many walls and flowers on cafeteria tables. 
</P>
<P>
They also visited punishment cells where, they were told, prisoners are kept 
without bedding or warm clothes even in the dead of winter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Inmates Quoted 
</P>
<P>
Former prisoners have said confinement at the camp, about 1,000 miles east of 
Moscow and 80 miles outside the industrial town of Perm, included

Asked how he reconciles his findings to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
denials that the Soviet Union still has political prisoners, Smith said, "I 
believe Mr. Gorbachev may have been misled by his own people."

<P>
Human rights groups estimate that there are still about 100 political prisoners 
in the Soviet Union, according to a State Department official accompanying the 
congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Mr. Gorbachev will use his immense political power to see these 
people are released," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Wolf said they and several human rights groups are pushing Soviet 
authorities to review the cases of the prisoners they met. Many were convicted 
of treason or for trying to leave the Soviet Union illegally.

DIRECT HOSTAGE TALKS WITH IRAN POSSIBLE;

<P>
President Bush's chief spokesman today held out the possibility of direct talks 
with Iran over the hostages under certain conditions, but cautioned, "We're 
nowhere near that." 
</P>
<P>
Among the preconditions toward any such direct dialogue with the new leaders of 
Tehran, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, would be a clear sign from 
authoritative Iranian officials that they are willing to enter such talks. 
</P>
<P>
A published report in Tehran said indirect U.S.-Iranian talks on the hostages 
will open within a few days, conducted through a third country, probably 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said it is "premature" to expect direct talks with Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman indicated, however, that indirect contacts will continue. He said 
the United States is likely to take advantage of Pakistani Foreign Minister 
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan's visit to Iran next week to send the Tehran government 
another message. 
</P>
<P>
Khan met with Vice President Dan Quayle last week and Quayle urged Pakistan to 
"become involved in helping facilitate the release of the hostages and to 
reveal information that Pakistan has accumulated on the situation," Quayle 
spokesman David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had said Wednesday that he did not want to miss any signal from the Middle 
East that might lead to freedom for the eight American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said the United States and Israel are being "forthcoming" with 
each other about efforts to free their hostages in Lebanon but were not 
coordinating their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials had claimed that Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
persuaded Bush in a 10-minute telephone call Wednesday night to coordinate 
efforts to release foreign hostages and Israeli prisoners held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've generally tried to be forthcoming with what we are doing, and they have 
been forthcoming with what they're doing. However, I would not characterize it 
as coordination," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The English-language Tehran Times said in an editorial today that indirect 
talks between Iran and the United States on the hostage crisis will begin 
within days. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the United States is "encouraging talks of every kind."

The new Central American accord on disbanding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels 
opens the door to a superpower agreement on halting arms supplies to the area, 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said today. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper Izvestia, Shevardnadze said the Central 
American accord has "cardinally improved" the situation in the region and makes 
possible a Soviet proposal for a halt in foreign arms deliveries there. 
</P>
<P>
"An agreement between the U.S.S.R. and the United States that they will both 
refrain from arms deliveries is most important in this respect," he said. 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for such an agreement nearly two 
years ago.

President Bush, passing over several more senior officers, today chose Army 
Gen. Colin Powell to be the first black chairman of the military Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Colin Powell has had a truly distinguished military career, and he's a 
complete soldier," Bush said in announcing his selection of Powell, who served 
as former President Ronald Reagan's sixth and last national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, 52, a four-star general who is believed certain to win confirmation 
from the Senate, would replace Navy Adm. William Crowe in the country's top 
military job on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing him for the post, Bush reached down the chain of command, bypassing 
such other officers as Army Gen. John Galvin, commander of NATO forces, and Air 
Force Gen. Robert Herres, the deputy chairman of the joint chiefs.

Hikaru Matsunaga, Japan's new minister of trade and industry, said today that 
Tokyo will not discuss any trade problems under the threat of U.S. retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the new government's hard-line approach, the new agriculture 
minister said Japan will continue to be completely self-reliant in rice to 
protect its farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga, appointed head of the International Trade and Industry Ministry on 
Wednesday by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, said at his first news conference as 
minister that Japan will deal positively with its structural trade problems in 
talks with the United States scheduled for early September. 
</P>
<P>
He said that some structural problems cannot be solved overnight and that Japan 
wants the United States to understand this. These problems include Japan's high 
savings rate and the special relationships among its companies, he said.

200 CONGRESSMEN PETITION BAKER TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO BAT TAKEOVER

More than 200 members of Congress have signed a letter urging Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III to express U.S. concerns about the hostile takeover 
bid for BAT Industries PLC and its American subsidiary to the British 
government. 
</P>
<P>
London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, also has significant 
interests in financial services, paper and retailing -- including such U.S. 
holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field department stores and 
Farmers Insurance Group. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of communities across America will be hurt by this hostile bid," 
according to the letter to Baker. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, disclosed today by Kentucky's two senators, Mitch McConnell and 
Wendell H. Ford, said the congressmen were "deeply concerned" about the bid 
that they said would eventually "dismantle a company that is important to 
hundreds of U.S. communities." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, British merchant banker 
Jacob Rothschild and Australian investor Kerry Packer and other investors made 
an offer for BAT valued at about $21.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among those participating in the cashless offer by Hoylake Investments Ltd, 
which would be Europe's largest to date, is former U.S. Treasury Secretary 
William E. Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Simon reportedly may be interested in buying BAT's Farmer's Group Inc. 
insurance division.

DESPITE 2ND DC-10 INCIDENT, FAA CHIEF SAYS PLANE IS SAFE

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said today that despite a 
second incident of a DC-10 engine breaking up in flight the McDonnell Douglas 
wide-body plane remains safe to fly. 
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator James Busey said the fact that the pilot on the Northwest 
Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Minneapolis shut down the tail engine and 
made a safe emergency landing in Denver on the remaining two engines Wednesday 
night showed the system worked. 
</P>
<P>
Busey told a press conference that the Northwest plane's engines were built by 
Pratt and Whitney, unlike the one on the United Airlines plane that 
disintegrated on a Denver-to-Chicago flight July 19. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 111 people of the 296 aboard the United flight died when the plane 
crashed and burst into flames trying to make an emergency landing in Sioux 
City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The United engine, whose parts sprayed through the plane's tail section and 
severed the DC-10's main and two backup hydraulic control systems, was made by 
General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government-Industry Study 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the FAA announced a joint government-industry study into 
the ability of wide-body planes to survive after such catastrophic incidents. 
</P>
<P>
It said the study would later extend to other planes with similar hydraulic 
systems that terminate in the tail section. 
</P>
<P>
Busey said there was no reason to ground the DC-10 as a precautionary measure. 
He said of the plane, "It's safe." 
</P>
<P>
He said the two incidents were being investigated by the National 
Transportation Safety Board and "when we know what needs to be done, then (we 
will) take the requisite action." 
</P>
<P>
Busey added that it would be irresponsible to act without sufficient 
information. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "We know of no hard facts at this time that would lead us to take any 
kind of action to ground the DC-10." 
</P>
<P>
But Busey said, "Rest assured, as the facts become available out of the 
investigatory process, we are prepared to take whatever action is indicated by 
those facts.

Three former South Carolina football coaches were sentenced today to terms 
ranging from three months to six months in a halfway house for their 
convictions stemming from the use and distribution of steroids in the athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge G. Ross Anderson also sentenced a Maryland man convicted of 
similar charges to a three-month term at a community security facility. 
</P>
<P>
Former coach Tom Kurucz, who pleaded guilty June 1 to one misdemeanor count of 
dispensing steroids to players and a felony county of lying to a grand jury, 
received the harshest sentence: six months in a halfway house and three years' 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Former coaches Jim Washburn and Keith Kephart, along with John L. Carter of 
Bethesda, Md., were each sentenced to three months in a halfway house and given 
three-year probationary terms. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Barton said he is satisfied with the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what our investigation uncovered was very serious," Barton said. "But 
it was probably less than what was played up in the press." 
</P>
<P>
Kephart, Kurucz and Washburn declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Carter also declined comment, but one of his attorneys, Mitchell Rubenstein, 
said he is disappointed with the sentence and believes that his client should 
not have to serve any time. 
</P>
<P>
Carter pleaded guilty on June 19 to two misdemeanor counts of providing the 
muscle-building drug to former Gamecock football player Tommy Chaikin. 
</P>
<P>
It was Chaikin's story in Sports Illustrated on Oct. 24 last year that prompted 
a grand jury probe of alleged steroid use within the school's athletic 
department.

After sending six aides to Minnesota to look into a proposed buyout of 
Canterbury Downs' bank debt, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has 
decided the deal would be too risky to participate in, the Star Tribune 
reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Greenberg, a retired Minneapolis accountant who hopes to buy the 
Shakopee race track, said he probably will be unable to swing the deal unless a 
backup company joins the sons of Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad in buying 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Although Greenberg said they do have a backup, he would identify that new 
potential investor only as a very large, well-known company. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner owns a racing stable and is the former owner of a Florida race 
track.
