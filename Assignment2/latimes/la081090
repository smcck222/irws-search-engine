GLOBETROTTERS' MOORPARK VISIT UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Harlem Globetrotters, renowned the world over for their basketball 
wizardry, may be about to stage a new stunt at the Moorpark College Gymnasium 
-- a disappearing training camp. 
</P>
<P>
The Globetrotters, who trained last September at Cal State Northridge, have 
been expected for months at Moorpark College, where two weeks of training and 
an exhibition game are scheduled to begin Aug. 27. Revenues from the exhibition 
game are earmarked for the college's sports program. 
</P>
<P>
But Globetrotters General Manager Joe Anzivino said Thursday that the training 
camp is "basically on hold at this moment" because the team may take a better 
offer elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Anzivino acknowledged that the team made an agreement with Moorpark College 
about six months ago. But within the last two weeks, he said, the team received 
word that the Globetrotters may be invited to appear on an upcoming ABC "Wide 
World of Sports" program to be filmed at Disney World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The team, which Anzivino said has a contract and a 17-year history of dealings 
with the network, set a scheduling deadline of 2 p.m. Thursday. But that 
deadline passed, Anzivino said, without a clear decision from the network. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Olsen, public information officer for Moorpark College, said that as of 
Thursday, "we have not received tickets and we are not selling tickets for the 
Sept. 9 game." 
</P>
<P>
As for the prospect of the Globetrotters' training camp and game being held, 
Olsen said, "any announcement regarding this should come from them." 
</P>
<P>
Olsen said he could not say what the college's response to a cancellation would 
be, other than disappointment. Anzivino said school officials have been very 
cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
The camp, which involves about two dozen players and about 60 Globetrotter 
personnel, was scheduled to begin Aug. 27 and close Sept. 9 with a game between 
the Globetrotters and their traditional opponents, the Washington Generals. 
Tickets were to cost $10 each, with revenues to benefit the Moorpark College 
athletic program and its 16 teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Moorpark are great," said Anzivino, a 29-year Globetrotter 
employee who lives in Agoura. "If we did not do the camp at Moorpark this year, 
it's simply a postponement. We will fulfill the commitment next year. In the 
meantime, if this thing does switch to Florida, we plan to make a contribution 
to the basketball program." 
</P>
<P>
The contribution, he said, would be a four-figure cash gift -- an amount 
comparable to the revenue the exhibition game could have generated. 
</P>
<P>
The team's revenues from the television event in Florida, Anzivino said, are 
likely to be "in six figures."

GOVERNOR CHANGES HIS TUNE ON LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Thursday said he may have been misinformed when he 
recently allowed the state to risk $15 million in general fund money on an 
unsecured loan to help with the construction of an Olympic Training Center in 
Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The admission came after Deukmejian tried to explain why he decided last week 
to veto as "unnecessary" special legislation requiring the San Diego National 
Sports Training Foundation to put up collateral for the controversial loan, 
which comes at a time when the state is cutting back drastically on social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he penciled out the provision because he had already been given 
written assurances by the foundation that it would repay the loan. "And 
negotiations for such a contract are under way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor allowed that he may have been under a false impression, however, 
when reporters pointed out that the contract for the loan had been signed in 
June, and that it doesn't require the foundation to offer security for the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
A state official told The Times after the contract was made public that the 
agreement was "unusual" and could lead to the state losing its money if the 
foundation folded or walked away from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the information that I had," Deukmejian said. "My information is 
that a contract has not yet been signed. . . . I don't have the right 
information. If that's in fact so, I would like to see what that contract 
says." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what action he could take, Deukmejian said he couldn't rescind last 
week's veto and that it would take new legislation to require the collateral 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his longstanding concerns that the loan be safe, Deukmejian said: 
"I will take a look at it and see what it says, if in fact there is a contract, 
see what it says, and I will want to be satisfied . . . that there is 
sufficient guarantee that this money will be repaid." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's comments Thursday were his first since news about the unsecured 
loan drew howls of protest this summer from a number of legislators who labored 
over an austere state budget that cuts deeply into social programs. 
</P>
<P>
The budget battle between Deukmejian and the Legislature dragged on 31 days 
into the current budget year and was resolved after the governor cut $753 
million from programs such as mental health and education. 
</P>
<P>
One of those lawmakers, Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), said Thursday he would 
contact the governor's office to say he'd be "pleased" to reintroduce the 
collateral requirement, which would have to be rushed through the Legislature 
during its remaining three weeks before adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very heartened to hear that he wants the loan secured. That's more like 
the George Deukmejian that I've known," said Seymour, who has lambasted the 
arrangement as a "bad deal." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial loan has raised eyebrows since last year, when foundation 
officials won approval from the Legislature to borrow $5 million a year for the 
next three years. Foundation backers, including shopping center magnate Ernie 
Hahn, sought the money as part of its fund-raising efforts to build a 
state-of-the-art, $60-million training center on the western shore of Lower 
Otay Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed by lawmakers in the waning hours of the 1989 session, 
originally stipulated that the money be repaid through the sale of specialized 
license plates. Yet critics claimed the financing scheme was a "sham," and the 
Department of Motor Vehicles estimated it would take 142 years to sell enough 
plates to pay back the $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Taking heed, Deukmejian signed the loan bill only after extracting a written 
promise from the foundation that it would repay the money if the license sales 
went bust. He disclosed the promise in an unusual message accompanying the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Those assurances, however, did not translate into financial security when the 
Department of Commerce subsequently negotiated the loan agreement with the 
foundation. The contract had no requirement for collateral, and Jack Stewart, 
the department's chief deputy director who negotiated the agreement, admitted 
to The Times that it was a "very unusual" deal that put the state's money at 
risk if the foundation went belly-up. Stewart was on vacation Thursday and 
couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation prompted Seymour and other legislators to insert special 
language in this year's budget bill calling for "a letter of credit, 
collateral, or other negotiable form of security" to cover the first $5 million 
installment, which is supposed to be forwarded to the foundation by Dec. 31. 
But, when the language reached Deukmejian's desk, he used his blue pencil to 
cut it out of the law. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's press conference, Deukmejian said the "reason I did it was at the 
time that I signed that legislation, I issued a specific statement about that 
bill in which I said at the time that I had received assurances in writing that 
the organizations supporting this Olympic training center would enter into a 
contract with the state to guarantee the payment of that money. And 
negotiations for such contract are under way." 
</P>
<P>
Told that a contract already exists with provisions for an unsecured loan, 
Deukmejian said he may have been misinformed and that he wanted to see the 
written agreement. 
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, Deukmejian press secretary Bob Gore accepted 
responsibility for Deukmejian's apparent misimpressions. 
</P>
<P>
Gore said he "made a mistake" by telling the governor that the Department of 
Commerce was still working on the deal, when in fact it was "working on getting 
us a copy of the contract." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the governor's office had not been tracking the legislative furor 
over the training center loan. "The issue, on a global scale of things, didn't 
register," he said. "There were a lot of other things to worry about. I didn't 
know about the contract." 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Gore modified the story: Deukmejian knew about the June contract 
all along. What the governor was referring to in the press conference was an 
unfinished "addendum" that would require collateral from the foundation, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are, and have been, for the past three weeks, the negotiations the 
governor referred to, discussions between the Department of Commerce to get 
collateral, to guarantee the loan," said Gore. "The foundation realizes the 
necessity to find collateral. What they're negotiating is an addendum to the 
contract that will satisfy the governor's signing this." 
</P>
<P>
But David Nielsen, foundation executive vice president, said Thursday that 
there are no negotiations going on, and that the nonprofit group will approach 
the state in several weeks with an offer for collateral -- an offer prompted by 
the legislative outcry, and not from Deukmejian's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We always felt that we had a legally binding agreement with the Department of 
Commerce," said Nielsen. "On the other hand, we heard the concerns that were 
expressed and felt that we should respond to them."

SLIME ATOP WATER STILL A MYSTERY; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA KEYS: THE CITY HAS POSTED WARNINGS TO SWIMMERS ON THE BEACHES THAT DOT 
THIS POSH RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ventura County health officials on Thursday took water samples for the third 
time in three weeks from the Ventura Keys after Keys residents called to 
complain about a thick, greenish-brown slimy substance atop the waterways in 
front of their residences. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also were called and took their own set of samples, but neither 
they nor county inspectors were able to determine immediately either the cause 
of the problem or the nature of the substance. Nor were they able to determine 
to what degree, if any, the substance was contaminating the waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Both county and city officials said they must wait three to five days for lab 
test results before reaching any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara Fosbrink, the city's coastal project manager, said a preliminary 
study from the city lab chemist showed that the substance "could be largely 
algae and protozoas," which are harmless. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the small beaches that dot this posh, upscale neighborhood of 
waterfront residences near the Ventura Harbor remained posted with warnings by 
the city alerting prospective swimmers to "exhibit caution/discretion in any 
bodily contact with the channel waters." 
</P>
<P>
Those signs were put up after samples taken by county health officials July 25 
indicated a "higher-than-normal coliform count" in the channel waters. Coliform 
concentrations usually signal contamination from decaying materials such as raw 
sewage or dead animals, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Only a single water sample was taken on that occasion, and county officials 
returned last Tuesday for more extensive tests, the results of which are 
expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The city took responsibility for that problem last week after determining that 
it was caused by a storm drain discharge. In an unsigned statement, the city 
said remedial steps had been taken and pronounced the problem all but solved. 
</P>
<P>
So when Keys residents Ray Russum and his next-door neighbor, David Lawhorn, 
awoke Thursday morning to discover a pool of slime in front of their homes, 
they were upset. 
</P>
<P>
"This looks like the Exxon Valdez!" said Russum, referring to the giant oil 
spill off the coast of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what this is, but I . . . am not going to touch it," Lawhorn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Russum and representatives from the county and city, however, surveyed the 
mouths of several storm drain channels that empty into the Keys in separate 
expeditions and could find no obvious signs of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
And representatives from both the city and county said the substance found 
Thursday did not appear to pose a threat to the residents' health. 
</P>
<P>
"The high levels of bacteriological materials appear to be localized, and 
there's no reason to believe at this point that they pose a hazardous problem," 
said Bob Williamson of the Ventura County office of environmental health. 
</P>
<P>
Fosbrink said the "frothy mess" the residents complained about could be natural 
living organisms from the channel bottom that were raised to the surface by 
"respiratory gas" or carbon monoxide that accumulates at night beneath the 
surface and rise in the morning with the high temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The news from the city brought some relief to Russum. "I'm glad to hear that, 
but until I read the reports from the city and the county, I won't be sure," he 
said.

CAMARILLO SEEKS HALT TO BUILDERS' 15 PROJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: CITY OFFICIALS WANT COUNTY PLANNERS TO STOP FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
SANTA ROSA VALLEY. THEY SAY THE PLANS VIOLATE THE GREENBELT AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of Camarillo is headed for a possible showdown with county planners 
over 15 proposed new housing developments in the burgeoning Santa Rosa Valley 
that Camarillo officials say could become the virtual equivalent of a new city. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo City Council is urging the county to stop all further development 
in the neighboring valley to the east, where about 2,500 people now live in 
luxury houses on one-acre lots. 
</P>
<P>
The newest proposals from a group of 15 developers to build houses on 463 acres 
of agricultural land and open space violate the county's greenbelt agreement 
and development guidelines limiting growth to city areas, Camarillo officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 1,000 residents that the developments will bring will add to the 
burden of already crowded schools in the area and create more traffic than 
Santa Rosa Road can handle, City Council members charged Wednesday. Residents 
use Santa Rosa Road to travel east through Camarillo to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just doing step-out development here, folks; we're creating a new 
city," said Councilwoman Sandi Bush. "The Santa Rosa Valley already has a 
population that is larger than Ojai and only about 3,000 people less than when 
the city of Camarillo incorporated in 1964." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Wednesday to urge the county to stop building in 
the Santa Rosa Valley and deny requests for an amendment to the county general 
plan to allow one of the proposed developments. 
</P>
<P>
But the city, which has grown rapidly at its east end, has contributed to many 
of the problems itself, said Bruce Smith, general plan section manager of the 
County Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be great if the city of Camarillo was as strict with its own 
development as it is with this particular plan," Smith said. The county has no 
intention of creating a new city in the Santa Rosa Valley, he said. Including 
the proposed projects, the maximum population of the Santa Rosa Valley is about 
5,600 people with about 1,650 houses, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine property owners of the 332-acre Caston Trust property south of Santa Rosa 
Road propose to divide the land into 278 one-acre lots for houses. The area is 
now zoned for agriculture or open space, with minimum lot sizes ranging from 10 
to 40 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six of the 332 acres are part of a greenbelt area that the county and 
city have jointly agreed to leave as a buffer between cities. 
</P>
<P>
The county must amend its general plan to approve the Caston Trust proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Another six property owners want to build houses on 50 one-acre lots north of 
Santa Rosa Road. That area is already zoned for houses and requires no plan 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff has not yet decided whether to recommend approval of the 
proposals. Both the County Planning Commission and the County Board of 
Supervisors will hold public hearings before supervisors decide on the 
proposals in late November, planner Dan Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo officials have already made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult enough to have orderly development within the cities, let alone 
this kind of leapfrog development," said Councilman David Smith, referring to 
the increase of development outside the boundaries of established cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a slow march right up to the city limits," Bush said.

TEAMS REPLAY NIGHT OF MALATHION RAIN FOR ACTIVIST GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Players made great catches. Fans cheered in the grandstand. It was a typical 
game in the Pony-Colt League the night of April 17 -- until the pesticide 
malathion rained on the baseball diamond at Holifield Park in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a madhouse out here," said Kevin Sanders, manager of the Orioles, a 
Pony team of boys 13 and 14 years old. "People were just running everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Many coaches, players and fans returned to the field last Saturday night to 
re-enact the spraying incident for a commercial produced by anti-malathion 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
"With children involved, there would be more of an emotional impact," said 
cameraman Monty Rowan, a member of Action Now, a group opposed to pesticide 
spraying. Rowan said he hopes to persuade movie theaters to show the 30-second 
commercial as a public service announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, 28, the Orioles manager, recalled the night of the game between the 
Orioles and Cardinals, when the helicopters arrived about 9:15 from beyond 
left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the third or fourth inning," he said. "They were flying in 
military-style formation. I said to the ump, 'Hey, we got malathion coming.' He 
put a halt to the game." 
</P>
<P>
As the spray -- used in an effort to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly -- 
descended, players and fans ran behind the backstop to the shelter of the snack 
shack; many huddled beneath trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids were laughing and kind of making a joke out of it at first," 
Sanders said. "As it fell you could taste it, it sticks to your clothes. They 
didn't think it was too funny after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Gutierrez, 8, a player in the league who had been a spectator at the 
game, recalled: "It was sticky, I had to take a bath." His friend, Jesse Jones, 
10, said: "It felt like rain. I looked at the choppers and started running." 
</P>
<P>
Irene Garcia, 30, sat in the stands that April night. She was 3 1/2 months 
pregnant at the time. "I got nauseated," she recalled. "It was dripping from 
the trees. It was on the benches. We had to get rags and wipe them off. The 
smell was awful." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Eddie, an assistant coach with the Orioles, said: "It was like an 
assault scene from a Vietnam movie." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people who were at the game reported becoming ill after the 
spraying, according to a survey by Jean Hinsley, a Norwalk resident who said 
she suffered laryngitis after a spraying last December. 
</P>
<P>
In Hinsley's survey, 67 of 159 people at the game -- 39 children and 28 adults 
-- told her they felt sick, either that night, the next day or during the next 
week. The most common complaints were of headaches, sore throats, irritated 
eyes and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Stratton, an epidemiologist with the state Department of Health 
Services, questioned whether those symptoms could be attributed to malathion. 
"They could have been caused (by exposure to) a virus at the ballgame," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what we know of the toxicity of malathion and the application rate, 
this ought not to represent an acute health problem for the folks involved." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Koons, director of the Los Angeles County Health Department's malathion 
evaluation clinic project, said that exposure to the spray "could cause 
possible allergic effects and eye irritation." 
</P>
<P>
Koons said the clinic has asked Hinsley for her information but has not yet 
received it. "Our department has been doing surveys and collecting illness 
reports, and we are analyzing them for patterns of illness in the spraying 
areas," Koons said. 
</P>
<P>
Hinsley said she has not given her survey to the clinic project, but has shown 
it to a state Department of Food and Agriculture committee that meets to 
discuss malathion spraying. She added that she challenged the evaluation clinic 
to conduct the same surveys she did. 
</P>
<P>
The black sky above the ballfield held only a full moon last Saturday night. 
Players and spectators were told by a film crew to make believe that 
helicopters were swooping down. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters, on cue, tore off the field. Caught up in the filmmaking, they 
laughed as they reached the snack stand, their spikes scratching the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The klieg lights were turned on. A camera was positioned atop a light tower. 
Director Pascal Franchot, 28, who has worked on other commercials, began 
casting. 
</P>
<P>
"Were you scared the night of the spraying?" he asked Jake Sanders, 12, a 
second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"A little bit," was the shy reply. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you be able to act scared again?" Franchot asked. 
</P>
<P>
Jake nodded, then was given an audition. He ran in front of a dugout and when 
Franchot shouted, "Now! Helicopters!" the boy stopped and scanned the sky with 
a look of terror. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent," said Franchot, and he gave Jake the part. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with the camera rolling, a crowd of about 60 people, bathed in white 
lights, ran screaming from the stands toward the snack shop. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial, Rowan explained, will include footage of soldiers running along 
a river to avoid Agent Orange being dumped in Vietnam, and a farmer fleeing 
crop dusters in a grape vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
Rowan said the commercial would normally cost about $150,000 to make but is 
being done for almost nothing because of donations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major concern is informing the public about abuse of pesticides," Rowan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A slow-motion shot of Jake Sanders looking up at helicopters will open the 
malathion segment. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked his shyness," Rowan said. "It enabled us to capture the sense of fear 
we wanted."

The Rancho Simi Recreation and Parks District has begun construction of the 
25-acre Rancho Madera Community Park and is expanding its 10-acre Rancho Tapo 
Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Madera Park, at Wood Ranch Parkway and Lake Park Drive, will include a 
softball diamond, soccer field and a perimeter walkway. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the park construction will cost about $1 million, with money 
coming from developers' fees and the park district's general fund, parks 
spokesman Rick Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Tapo Park, at Avenida Simi and Lemon Street, will be expanded by six 
acres. Completion of the two parks will cost $3.2 million, Johnson said. SCOTT

BERNHARDT FIRES BACK AS RECALL BATTLE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backed by about 60 friends and campaign supporters, San Diego Councilwoman 
Linda Bernhardt used a well-choreographed meeting at the City Hall concourse 
Thursday to launch her defense against a recall effort spearheaded by a group 
of neighborhood activists from District 5. 
</P>
<P>
Although billed as a press conference, Bernhardt's afternoon meeting quickly 
took on the appearance of a campaign rally, as Bernhardt's staff urged 
supporters to stand behind their candidate while she spoke to reporters. 
Bernhardt's supporters broke into applause several times during the press 
conference when she pledged not to "back down" in the face of the recall 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt characterized the recall effort as a "witch hunt" staged by the 
city's "Old Guard," which she said includes Councilman Bruce Henderson, Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor and former Councilman Ed Struiksma. Bernhardt alleged that the 
"Old Guard" was "waging a war against Linda Bernhardt." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt acknowledged that some of her strongest supporters in last November's 
campaign were disillusioned because she would no longer represent Scripps Ranch 
if the council adopts a controversial redistricting plan proposed by Councilman 
John Hartley. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernhardt maintained the recall drive was being led by "some political 
forces that can't stand a new voice at City Hall." She suggested that those 
political forces were trying to win support by "duping" community leaders in 
District 5, which she represents. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt was surrounded by community leaders from District 5 and 
representatives of environmental groups, developers, the business community and 
the gay and lesbian communities. 
</P>
<P>
Just minutes after Bernhardt's press conference ended, a second group gathered 
just a few yards away to officially announce their recall effort of Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by about a dozen supporters, Kathy Gausted, co-chairwoman of the 
recently formed "Recall Bernhardt Committee" began the politically tough task 
of ousting a seated council member. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda Bernhardt has violated the public trust and must be removed from 
office," said Gausted, who said that Bernhardt treats her constituents with 
"apathy, arrogance and, oftentimes, dishonesty." 
</P>
<P>
However, while Gausted blasted Bernhardt's performance during seven months in 
office, she gave few concrete examples of why Bernhardt should be recalled. 
Gausted also said the current redistricting fight was not the key reason for 
the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
Gausted estimated that her group, which so far has collected less than $300, 
will need $20,000 if it is to successfully force Bernhardt from the office that 
she has occupied since January. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the recall group's steering committee members are from Mira Mesa or 
Serra Mesa. Just one, Donna Evans, is from Scripps Ranch. One member is from 
Rancho Bernardo and the other is from Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
Gausted denied that her group had any political ties to O'Connor, Henderson or 
Struiksma. 
</P>
<P>
She said political consultant Jack Orr has agreed to work for "20% of whatever 
we can raise." Gausted denied Orr had organized the anti-Bernhardt movement. 
She said the group hired Orr because they need his "professional capabilities" 
to succeed in the recall effort.

BANK HOLDUP CALLED SIMILAR TO 3 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of robbing three Ventura County banks by writing his demand 
notes on Manila envelopes robbed a fourth bank in Oxnard Thursday morning using 
a similar technique, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man robbed the Bank of A. Levy, 1830 Victoria Ave., about 11:30 a.m. and 
fled on foot with an unknown amount of money, said Lt. Stan Myers of the Oxnard 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth robbery by the same suspect in Ventura and Oxnard in three 
weeks, and each time the robber produced a note demanding money and warning 
that he had a gun, said Gary Auer, agent in charge of the FBI's Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
The first three notes were scrawled on Manila envelopes although Auer would not 
confirm that Thursday's robber used the same kind of paper. He said only that 
the man produced a written note and that the robber's technique was similar. 
</P>
<P>
Tellers have not observed a weapon in any of the four robberies, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank robber is described as a white male, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and 
weighing about 160 pounds. He is believed to be between 25 and 30 and has short 
blond hair, Auer said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

MATILIJA DAM REPAIR OPTIONS DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matilija Dam, built to control flooding and provide water for the Ojai Valley, 
is filling up with silt, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Something has to be done with it in the near future," said County Flood 
Control Director Gerald Nowak. "The next major rainfall will probably silt it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
The dam, set in rugged Matilija Canyon five miles north of Ojai, was declared 
safe for the people who live below it after the annual inspection by the 
Division of Dam Safety, said John Johnson, general manager of Casitas Municipal 
Water District. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "Should the crest have to be lowered again, effectiveness of 
Matilija Dam would disappear." 
</P>
<P>
If the dam fails, floodwaters would hit the communities of Ojala in five 
minutes, Meiners Oaks in 10 minutes, Oak View in 35 minutes and Casitas Springs 
in one hour, according to the county Dam Failure Response Plan. 
</P>
<P>
If sediment were removed from Matilija Lake behind the dam, it would better 
protect the area from floods and would yield Casitas Municipal Water District 
up to 2,000 annual acre-feet of water, even if the drought continues, said 
Richard Barnett, the district's chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
One acre-foot of water supplies a family of four for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Left as it is, the lake's yield would drop to 200 acre-feet after the year 
2010, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Fragile since it was built in 1948, the dam holds only 14% of its original 
capacity because it was built of unstable concrete that expands and splits, 
weakening the structure. 
</P>
<P>
By 1965, state dam safety officials had ordered the dam's crest lowered twice. 
This reduced strain on the dam by cutting the lake capacity in half, from 7,000 
to 3,350 acre-feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
Winter rains have settled 4.4 million cubic yards of sediment behind the dam, 
leaving room for only 1,100 acre-feet of water, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials want to finance a study to determine whether the dam could withstand 
a higher volume of water or if it could be rebuilt as a safer, earthen-fill dam 
to reach its former capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Nowak, of the flood control agency, expected to split the $100,000 cost of a 
study of the dam with the Casitas Municipal Water District this year. But the 
Board of Supervisors cut the county's share from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Flood control and Casitas engineers regularly monitor the dam. 
</P>
<P>
"It really gets looked after," said James Logsdon, resident dam tender who 
keeps an eye on it for Casitas, operates the valves and chases off trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
Matilija Lake was a popular swimming and fishing hole until a flood in 1969 
wiped out a campground and boating concession. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, stricter drinking water regulations and higher insurance costs have 
forced the water company to keep people away. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Don Cunningham of the Sheriff's Department's Ojai substation estimates 
that deputies have issued 400 misdemeanor citations in the past year to 
trespassers who are fined $200 to $300. THIA BELL

STATE FUNDS COULD PAY FOR SAFE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 10,000 to 15,000 low- and middle-income residents of the El Rio and Nyeland 
Acres areas could get state help to pay for new safe water supplies, a state 
health official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A state grant of up to $400,000 could save the residents the estimated $2,000 
per household needed to solve the area's nitrate contamination problem, said 
Daniel Carrigan, the state Department of Health Services worker who arranges 
for state funding. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 small water districts serving the area must join together and form a 
public agency with an elected board of directors to qualify for the funds, 
Carrigan told district representatives meeting in El Rio on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no guarantees, Carrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a better-than-average chance of being funded," Carrigan said of the 
districts. "But we only have $20 million left in the 1988 bond-law money and we 
have $900 million in requests for funding." 
</P>
<P>
The districts could also be eligible for $5 million in loans from the state. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrates are found in human and animal waste. They leach into ground water from 
back-yard septic tanks and agricultural field runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) has proposed a law to make $75 
million available to correct drinking-water problems. If approved by the 
Legislature, it would become a bond initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the districts made no decisions Thursday, but county 
officials pressed them to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrate contamination, which has already forced health officials to close wells 
in seven of the districts, could hit the remaining wells any time, said Robert 
Quinn, manager of the water resources division of the County Public Works 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The seven affected districts now receive emergency supplies from the city of 
Oxnard and the United Water Conservation District. Wells in the other districts 
contain nitrates but at levels low enough to meet state health standards, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole area has a problem with nitrates," Quinn said. "They need to 
recognize that it's going to happen to their wells sooner or later and that 
they need to look for a regional solution." 
</P>
<P>
The county recommends that the districts consolidate and join either the United 
Water Conservation District or the city of Oxnard. The cost per connection is 
about $2,000, whether the districts join a larger agency, dig new wells into 
deeper water supplies or blend their well water with other water, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
James Burke, a member of the board of directors of the Vineyard Avenue Estates 
Mutual Water District, said a consensus among the groups may be impossible.

20 INDICTED IN MONEY-LAUNDERING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal agents seized guns, expensive coins, a gem-laden watch and about 
$300,000 in cash in raids at border currency exchanges that stemmed from the 
indictment of 20 people on charges that included laundering drug money, 
prosecutors announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 people -- from San Diego, Los Angeles and Tijuana -- were indicted on 
charges detailed in nine indictments that alleged a laundering scheme by four 
large-scale groups of Southern California-based marijuana and cocaine 
traffickers, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. William Braniff called the charges the result of an "important, 
focused attack on the life-blood of narcotics trafficking -- the money flow." 
</P>
<P>
But he and Assistant U.S. Atty. L.J. O'Neale, who headed a two-year undercover 
investigation that yielded the 20 indictments, said that 11 of the 20 suspects 
eluded arrest when agents raided six San Ysidro currency exchanges Wednesday. 
Those 11 remained at large Thursday, O'Neale said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neale also said he was hopeful that the investigation would disrupt the 
regular channels of money laundering -- the transfer of cash among different 
people and accounts to make it appear that it was gained legitimately. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Neale also suggested that the impact of any single probe into alleged 
money laundering, even one netting $300,000, is difficult to gauge because, he 
said, about $2 billion a year in drug money is laundered through San Diego 
businesses and banks. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents began the series of raids at San Ysidro currency exchanges 
Wednesday morning, O'Neale said. A grand jury had returned the nine indictments 
Tuesday, court records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the nine indictments remain sealed, court clerks said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the six businesses searched was C &amp; M Money Exchange, O'Neale said. 
It, or operator Julio Fillad, 31, of Imperial Beach, were named in five of the 
six indictments that were unsealed Thursday at the downtown San Diego federal 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Fillad remained at large Thursday, O'Neale said. Among the other 10 suspects 
still being sought was Manuel Hector Roman-Angulo, identified in one of the 
indictments as the chief of one of the four drug-trafficking groups, O'Neale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to one of the indictments, C &amp; M was used to funnel money from 
the four organizations specializing in cocaine and marijuana trafficking to 
U.S. dollar accounts in Mexican banks. From those accounts, the cash was 
electronically sent overseas, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the other indictments unsealed Thursday alleged conspiracies to evade 
filing the paper work that U.S. law requires for cash transactions of more than 
$10,000. Three indictments alleged conspiracies to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 20 people named in the indictments were arrested Wednesday, one 
surrendered to authorities and another is due to surrender next week, O'Neale 
said. He added that the eight who were arrested or who surrendered were 
arraigned Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Roger McKee: 
</P>
<P>
Fillad's wife, Luz Maria Fillad, 30, of Imperial Beach, was being held at the 
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center pending a bail hearing next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Also being held at MCC pending a bail hearing next Monday were Rolando Orozco, 
31, of San Ysidro; Jorge Reyna, 29, of San Ysidro and Jorge Martinez, 20, of 
Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Candelas, whose age and address were unknown, was in custody at MCC 
awaiting a bail hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
Nora Fraire, 25, of Tijuana, and Cancio Soto, whose age and address were 
unknown, were released after arraignment on $25,000 bail. Soto turned himself 
in to authorities Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Raul Reyes, 41, of Chula Vista, was due to be released late Thursday on 
$100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scott Valencia, 23, of Chula Vista, is scheduled to surrender Tuesday 
to federal authorities, O'Neale said.

CITY REQUESTS INSPECTION REPORTS ON COLLAPSED AWNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost two months after a heavy, department-store awning collapsed in a busy 
shopping center, narrowly missing a group of lunchtime shoppers, the city 
building department is making its first formal requests for the store's 
building inspection records. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Lopez, the city's chief of structural inspection, said he sent letters 
this week requesting the records from five different sources, all of which were 
connected in some way to the store's construction in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Through those records, city officials hope to identify the special inspector 
who may have approved faulty welding that caused the 2-ton, concrete-and-metal 
awning above the main entrance to the Robinson's department store in La Jolla 
to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one was injured when the awning crashed onto the sidewalk at 
University Towne Centre June 15, Fire Capt. Al Macdonald said the incident had 
the makings of a "major disaster." 
</P>
<P>
City officials later determined that faulty welds, combined with the ravages of 
wind and weather, caused the collapse. What they could not find, however, was a 
series of periodic inspection reports that should have been included in the 
city's building file for the project. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last month, Lopez said the city does not keep such records, 
which are routinely done by city-certified, independent inspectors, because 
filing them would be "a monumental task." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Lopez said city officials receive progress reports every two weeks 
during construction, plus a final report, and all of those records should be 
included in the building files. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinson's reports, Lopez said, could not be located because they had 
either been lost or misfiled. 
</P>
<P>
"We file any document that we have and microfilm it," Lopez said. "That's the 
policy now, and that was the policy then. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what the procedure was, but knowing the procedure and verifying whether 
the procedure is carried out are two different things," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Lopez directed letters to Robinson's officials and also to the 
architectural firm that designed the building, the construction firm that did 
the work, the engineering firm that oversaw development, and the company that 
supplied the inspector for the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he requested the records by telephone from Englekirk &amp; Hart 
Consulting Engineers, the project's engineering firm, last month. The firm 
responded by sending the city a copy of one special inspection report covering 
only part of the project. 
</P>
<P>
That report was signed by Robert Lakin, an inspector who apparently died last 
year, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
But, with only one report available, city officials could not determine how 
much of the work Lakin had personally inspected, said Richard Christopherson, 
the city's director of building inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"He may have been filling in for the regular inspector that day, or he may have 
done the whole project," Christopherson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, City Councilman Ron Roberts has requested that the city manager's 
office prepare a report on the Robinson's incident specifically and the 
building department's record-keeping procedures in general. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a failure and a file disappears, that concerns me," Roberts 
said. "That's a major screw-up if they can't even find out who the special 
inspector was." 
</P>
<P>
Although Roberts said he hoped to hear the report at the Sept. 5 meeting of the 
Public Services and Safety Committee, one of the committee's staff members said 
the councilman would have to formally request the report at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
That might mean that the city manager's report would not be heard by committee 
members before November, said Raquel Beltran, a legislative specialist for the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"This is getting awful messy," Roberts said. "The deeper we get into this, the 
worse it stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he was puzzled by the fact that the building department was only 
beginning to make formal inquiries for the records this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they've waited," Roberts said. "It's been several months. I 
thought they had concluded their investigation."

CUTTING WATER USE AND DWP LEAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to register my outrage at the way the new storm drain levy 
schedule was calculated by the Los Angeles City Council (Aug. 1). Once again, 
people who reside on large lot residential properties have been unfairly 
singled out. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't the sewer fee devised by the DWP bad enough? 
</P>
<P>
The additional water used on our property goes into the ground, not into the 
storm drains and certainly not into the sewers. Our trees, roses and other 
shrubs (no pool) help the environment of this increasingly crowded, asphalted 
and polluted city. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what makes this entire situation so infuriating is that this same group 
of geniuses (otherwise known as the City Council) just approved the paving of 
the hills of Porter Ranch with 4,000 new homes and office buildings. No doubt 
Councilman Hal Bernson will probably tell us that this grotesque project will 
have little impact on the storm drains just like it isn't going to impact the 
sewers, freeways, air and landfills. Sure, Hal.

U.S. RESPONSE TO CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Jesse Jackson's column "Lacking a Cold War, U.S. Draws a Blank" 
(Commentary, Aug. 2), again Jackson has proven to be a disappointment in his 
comments on the civil war in Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is upset at what he considers "a weak and inadequate response" on the 
part of the U.S. He points out what he claims to be "a 143-year-old 'special 
relationship' " between the U.S. and Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
His "proof" that America's interests are at stake is the one example of the 
Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. in Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson feels the U.S. should have used armed intervention to stop the civil 
war. Yet, I've noticed that Jackson is very selective in his demands for U.S. 
action. His double standard, as applied to the Middle East for example, is 
quite evident. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is demanding U.N. Security Forces to stop the Liberian fighting. Yet, 
he never so demanded to protect innocent Israeli civilians from Syrian and 
Jordanian terrorist attacks over the last 40 years. He demands "a massive 
emergency relief effort" for Liberia, yet he supports those at home and abroad 
that would cut off U.S. aid to Israel, a tiny democracy and American ally, in a 
sea of Arab masses. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of "special relationships," just who does Jackson think the U.S. has 
to depend on, but Israel, in the developing oil wars of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's credibility could be greatly enhanced if he simply recognized that 
fairness must be applied to all persecuted peoples, not just the few that he 
has a personal or political interest in.

Your editorial ("Thinking the Unthinkable," July 31) suggested, "Yes, U.S. 
intervention in Liberia may be the best humanitarian move." 
</P>
<P>
Why United States troops? Where are the United Nations peacekeeping forces? 
Clearly this horrifying massacre of 600 women and children is a violation of 
the principles of the United Nations Charter. When are we going to impose 
compliance with the U.N. Charter and international law? We need an 
international force capable of preventing such massacres and a commander in 
chief who need not wait for the Security Council to debate the problem.

CUTTING WATER USE AND DWP LEAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest the article on DWP leaks (July 26). I discovered a similar 
leak in my neighborhood a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
I made at least four calls to the DWP "Trouble Board" to report this leak; I 
never got through to anyone who could or would help. For all I know the leak is 
still not fixed. 
</P>
<P>
I am a water pipeline contractor and this type of incident always attracts my 
attention. The answer to this problem is to have these breaks repaired by 
private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Public Works has a list of contractors for 
emergency repair work of sewer problems. I am on this list and I know it works. 
We respond quickly to these problems and they are repaired for much less than 
the city could afford to do it. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly suggest that DWP officials explore the use of private contractors to 
repair their system and also work on new installations. The work would get done 
quicker and private contractors would cost the public much less money.

What Saddam Hussein has done and, perhaps more important, what as a result will 
not be done in Washington, jeopardize the controlling concern in this crisis: 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said "standing up for our principles is an American tradition." 
</P>
<P>
That is principle, spelled p-e-t-r-o-l-e-u-m. 
</P>
<P>
Far over the horizon is the principle of defending democracy, which here means 
Israel. Hovering in the ether and selectively invoked is the principle of 
acting against aggression. But the principle that drives our purpose here is: 
We will defend, with force if necessary, our economy. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a contemptible principle. But already Saddam Hussein, execrated as 
an aggressor and dictator, is being exploited as an alibi and an excuse. He is 
to be the alibi for any recession. And he is the excuse for evading, again, 
disagreeable political decisions in domestic policy that would serve the goal 
for which we have sent the fleet: prosperity.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CLASSIC SPANISH FOOD AND YOUTHFUL CALIFORNIA 
SPIRITS MAKE HEADY MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As in the sport of bullfighting, certain dangers come with the territory at the 
minuscule Ole Madrid restaurant in the Gaslamp Quarter: You are likely to leave 
not only stuffed to the gills, but hoarse. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation to precede the entrees with entirely too many tapas (appetizers, 
in the truest sense of the word) is nearly irresistible, and the decibel count 
attained by the paroxysm of voices and recorded music that reverberates in the 
narrow space demands that you shout to be heard above the racket. Anyone who 
has observed his 30th birthday -- an occasion that would seem well into the 
future for much of Ole Madrid's clientele -- may find his vocal cords going 
wonky after half an hour or so of attempting to be heard above the din. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being a source of complaint, however, the noise level makes Ole Madrid 
seem particularly alive and vital, which must be one of the main attractions 
for the young, willfully avant-garde crowd that throngs the place. Flamenco 
music and contemporary Latin pop tunes alternate, with flamenco the clear 
favorite of the staff, which pauses from its chores to clap in time to the 
music. Other draws would be the fairly affordable menu of classic Spanish 
dishes, and, in some ways even more interesting, the deliberate anachronisms of 
the decor. 
</P>
<P>
Gaslamp Quarter restaurants increasingly seem to take a Janus-like attitude 
that emphasizes both the antiquity (in local terms) of the premises and the 
thoroughly contemporary outlook of the management. At Ole Madrid, vestiges of 
past centuries, such as the plank floor, the rush-bottomed chairs, the round 
wooden tables and the cabinetmaker-perfect back bar (hung with sausages, ropes 
of peppers and a serrano ham) bespeak the quintessential Iberian taberna. 
Juxtaposed against these are such purposefully modern notes as the wall-sized 
canvas painted with a copy of Picasso's "Guernica" and the exposed heating 
duct-turned-architectural statement, which is no longer a novel statement but 
does make a point. The lighting, oddly enough, glows brightly, a situation that 
does not seem to slow the crowd for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Madrid is the result of a collaboration among three men in their mid-20s, 
two Spaniards and a Mexican, who have written a menu that touches upon many of 
the basics and some of the highlights of everyday Spanish cooking. The cold and 
hot tapas lists are sufficiently extensive to offer the makings of a complete 
meal, an option that would be completely acceptable in the Ole Madrid idiom and 
would have its virtues on many occasions. However, there is much of interest 
under the other menu headings, notably the white bean and garlic soups and such 
seafood entrees as the zarzuela and the parrillada de mariscos. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen likes strong, definite flavors and is not shy about its use of 
garlic, spiced olives and lemon. Even the butter that accompanies the sliced 
baguette in the bread basket is infused with garlic and lemon. Even better are 
the bread slices half-saturated with crushed raw tomato, a delightful trick 
that makes a beguilingly tasty snack out of two very ordinary ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Tapas generally are understood to be small portions of highly seasoned food to 
be consumed as snacks or as a prelude to a meal. The selection at Ole Madrid is 
fairly straightforward and fits the definition perfectly. Among the simplest 
are a plate of sliced, imported chorizo sausage, which tastes of paprika but is 
fairly mild; the spicier cantinpalo, a rich, fatty sausage based on smoked ham 
and seasoned with about treble the amount of paprika as chorizo, and the grand 
jamon serrano, a subtle cousin of both the French Bayonne ham and Italian 
prosciutto, thinly sliced and worthy of the diner's undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Madrid makes two versions of tortilla, the most universal tapa, which is 
simply a baked omelet built around a layer of cubed potatoes. It sounds bland 
-- and it is, when made carelessly -- but there is a satisfying, eggy 
smoothness to the preparation, a room-temperature wedge of which fits in quite 
nicely among a collection of spicier plates. The slightly more deluxe de la 
casa version has an especially smooth finish. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of hot tapas includes fried baby squid, pastry empanadas stuffed 
with tuna and a choice of shrimp, chicken or mushrooms smothered in garlic 
sauce, all of which are classics. Another traditional item, the croquetas de 
pollo (deep-fried chicken croquettes), had a rather good flavor but a heavy, 
pasty texture that was off-putting. The least familiar choice, tosta de 
Excalivada, also is among the most satisfying. It consists of tomato-saturated 
bread, dressed with strips of roasted peppers, eggplant and onion, and heated 
in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
Among lighter plates, there are sandwiches of serrano ham with Manchego cheese 
and grilled chicken with Romaine and tomato, and such dressy salads as the 
catalana, an Italian-style plate of buffalo-milk mozzarella alternated with 
basil leaves and sliced tomato. Italian influences are not uncommon in catalan 
cooking, which makes a specialty of such things as cannelloni. Some of the 
soups could make a meal, particularly the richly savory fabada, a brew of white 
beans flavored with sausage and ham, and the sopa de ajo, a pungent garlic soup 
thickened with crushed bread and beaten egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the entrees are prepared for two diners only, which demands a degree 
of negotiation before a table can taste the paella Valenciana (saffron rice 
cooked with seafood, chicken and sausage), paella marinara, a rice dish 
garnished solely with fish and shellfish, and the parrillada de mariscos, a 
fairly straightforward platter of grilled salmon, shrimp, squid, sole and crab. 
</P>
<P>
Other choices include octopus stewed in its own ink, a fairly challenging dish 
that many who have had past experience with are content to leave to others, and 
fish filet Ibiza-style, dressed in an herbed cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The act of consuming the zarzuela, a soup-stew of mussels, clams, unshelled 
shrimp and the tiniest imaginable squid, requires eagerness, panache and a 
certain disregard for the state of one's apparel, since it is served in a great 
quantity in an earthenware bowl and is quite messy to eat. The broth takes its 
pungency from the addition of chopped, spiced olives, which also make it rather 
too salty. 
</P>
<P>
The pasta mediterranea, on the other hand, seems uncertain in its Spanish 
heritage but is an elegant dish of fettuccine tossed with plump shrimp and a 
rich cream sauce flavored -- most unusually but likeably -- with rosemary and 
lemon. The beef filet andaluz, sliced thinly and baked with cheese under a 
pungent tomato sauce, is another simple but elegant dish. The saffron rice on 
the side is outstanding and should be a revelation to anyone who accepts San 
Diego's ubiquitous "rice pilaf" as this grain's gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Madrid offers a brief but sufficient list of Spanish vintages, and also 
serves house wine in the traditional glass porones, which add a festive note to 
the table setting. The dark sangria, which went unsampled, seems a great 
favorite with much of this restaurant's clientele.

<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of being energy independent, we find ourselves, like so many colonial 
powers before us, dependent on resources that we have no right to control. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the way President Bush describes the situation; it wouldn't sound 
good. Speaking to us on television Thursday, he employed all the World War II 
language -- "aggression," "appeasement," "blitzkrieg," "freedom" and 
"principle". 
</P>
<P>
But what we fear is not that aggression will be "rewarded," but that we and the 
other oil-consuming nations will have to cough up the reward money. 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds crass, so be it. The real battle in the Mideast today is not 
between the good guys and the bad. It's between the consumers -- with America 
being the biggest -- and one power-mad producer apparently set on cornering the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Want it even blunter? The real reason we have sent our forces into Saudi Arabia 
is not to protect "principle" but the sweet deal we've had with the Kuwaiti and 
Saudi royal families all these decades. Just as our forebears bought Manhattan 
from the Native Americans for a few strings of beads, we've been able to buy 
the subterranean wealth of the Persian Gulf by putting jewels on the effete 
fingers of the Gulf's royal families. 
</P>
<P>
This, not the consummate evil of one Iraqi bully, not the noble cause of 
"freedom," is what this week's saga is all about. We have a deal with the Saudi 
Arabian princes. Our servicemen are being sent there to protect that deal. 
</P>
<P>
The only "principle" we're guarding, if you want to call it that, is monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Could today's dangers have been avoided? Yes. A decade ago, an American 
President pleaded with us to end our reliance on OPEC oil. He preached 
conservation. He promoted alternative energy sources like solar and wind 
energy. The country, unfortunately, wasn't ready to hear the truth. 
</P>
<P>
We will be safe from Persian Gulf fanatics like Saddam Hussein only when we are 
less dependent as a nation on the Persian Gulf. That's a tough message. It 
would be good for us all if President Bush delivered it.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calls received over the past two years on a countywide hot line for police 
abuse or harassment showed minorities, especially blacks, made a 
disproportionate number of complaints and that general harassment was the most 
common complaint, the American Civil Liberties Union announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The study, based on 152 calls, also showed that San Diego police registered the 
highest number of complaints with 69, and the Sheriff's Department received 35. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, National City police and Oceanside police 
followed with eight each. 
</P>
<P>
The report is not being viewed as a definitive study of all alleged law 
enforcement misconduct, ACLU officials for San Diego and Imperial counties 
said. ACLU official Michael Crowley maintained that the study is a fair 
sampling of what he called a chronic problem of police misconduct in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Cmdr. Larry Gore commended the hot line as an additional 
avenue for citizens to lodge complaints, but he said he was concerned about the 
way the raw data was presented. "What can you really tell from statistics? They 
can be grossly misleading. The study is just an over-generalization and, unless 
you get behind the statistics, you don't really know what's being discussed," 
said Gore, spokesman for Police Chief Bob Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
Gore said, for example, that San Diego police received 456 complaints in 1989 
alone, saying that number is a far cry from the 69 the ACLU received in the 
past two years.

FAIRBANK-NIDEFFER LOSES HER BALANCE, IS FELLED BY PAULUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The psychological see-saw Escondido's Ros Fairbank-Nideffer has been riding all 
week tottered back and forth, then finally knocked her off Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The beneficiary was Barbara Paulus, and the Austrian went on to defeat 
Fairbank-Nideffer, 7-5, 6-3, in a quarterfinal of the $225,000 Great American 
Bank Tennis Tournament at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
It has been an suspenseful week for Fairbank-Nideffer. One day, she's psyched 
to play a first-round match against Martina Navratilova -- before Navratilova 
withdrew Tuesday because of an ankle injury -- and the next day, she's 
orchestrating a comeback victory against hometown rival Angelica Gavaldon. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours later, she's falling apart at the seams against Paulus, 
playing what she said was a match she wouldn't have paid to see. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could get back (in it) because the match had been so awful," 
Fairbank-Nideffer said. "At that point, I found myself thinking, 'This is 
terrible. I wouldn't pay a dime to be watching this match.' Both of us were 
making terrible errors." 
</P>
<P>
Paulus was less critical of the level of play but agreed that it wasn't tennis 
at its best. 
</P>
<P>
"I played well, but I've had many better matches," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 5-2, in the first set, Fairbank-Nideffer got even at 5-5 
but eventually lost, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
The second set was service disaster. Fairbank-Nideffer doubled-faulted seven 
times, and when she served trailing 5-3, she lost game, set and match by 
serving double-faults on the final three points. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't help that I didn't have any rhythm on my serve," she said. "I had 
been serving well until today, but I've made some changes in my serve, and I 
was having to think too much about it." 
</P>
<P>
While Fairbank-Nideffer will remember her match against Gavaldon, she said the 
loss to Paulus will also stay with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed to lose this match, especially like I did," she said. 
"Losing to someone you shouldn't lose to can shake you up. I wasn't expected to 
win, but I believe I can beat her. I usually play well against players ranked 
ahead of me (she is No. 25 in the world, Paulus No. 18). And I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
In the featured evening match, Ann Grossman and fourth-seeded Manuela 
Maleeva-Fragniere of Bulgaria played out what was a test of baseline longevity, 
and Grossman lost, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I ran out of gas. I think that's what it came down to," said 
Grossman, who played three consecutive days. "If I had a day off, I definitely 
would have been stronger in the second set." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, third-seeded Zina Garrison of Houston made quick work of 
France's Nathalie Herreman, needing a little over an hour to win, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
The field of 32 in the singles draw has been streamlined to six. Joining 
semifinalists Maleeva-Fragniere and Paulus, who will play Saturday, and 
quarterfinalist Garrison, are New York's Terry Phelps, France's Nathalie 
Tauziat and West German Steffi Graf, the overwhelming favorite. 
</P>
<P>
But Maleeva-Fragniere figures her chances to win are good, mainly because she's 
feeling good. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think I have good chances," she said. "I think because I'm 
aggressive, I've been hitting the ball really well, I'm confident. And I'm 
happy with the way I'm playing all week." 
</P>
<P>
Working in Maleeva-Fragniere's favor is what some players have described as a 
vulnerable Graf and that her sister, Katerina Maleeva, might have some advice 
after playing and losing to Graf in the final of the Canadian Open Sunday in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't talked yet about (a possible meeting with Graf)," she said. "We've 
talked about her match, we always talk, but I'm sure she'll give me some 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
First, she must get past sixth-seeded Paulus. For what it's worth, Magdalena 
Maleeva, a third tennis-playing sister who is visiting here this week, says 
Maleeva-Fragniere's chances of winning the tournament are "100%." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Paulus plays," said Maleeva-Fragniere, ranked ninth in the world. 
"I suppose it will be a baseline match, because she hits the ball hard. 
Whoever's more aggressive will win." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman missed opportunities. She came back from a 5-2 deficit to even the 
match in the first set at 5-5 but lost the next two games. 
</P>
<P>
The second set took all of 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm discouraged because I couldn't win the first set," Grossman said. "But 
I'll use this as a learning experience. Sometimes I want it so bad, I rush, I 
try to go too fast. I have to slow down. But I learned I can be up there 
someday. I will be up there." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Terry Phelps, who can be seen here at the pool as often as on the tennis 
courts, meets Zina Garrison in tonight's featured match. An avid football fan 
and friend of the Jets' Tony Eason, Phelps has snagged some tickets to Saturday 
night's Charger-Cowboy game. And the semifinals are scheduled for 12:30 p.m. 
and 6:30 Saturday.

PADRES: TEAMMATES, FANS HONOR TEMPLETON ON OCCASION OF HIS 2,000TH CAREER HIT 
DURING 7-0 VICTORY IN ATLANTA. BUT OFF THE FIELD, HIS THOUGHTS FOCUS ON HIS 
AILING FATHER. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were his Padre teammates, standing on the top step of the dugout 
Thursday, clapping their hands in tribute. The Braves fans at Atlanta-Fulton 
County Stadium, seeing the message on the scoreboard, rose as one, cheering him 
as if he were one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton, standing alone at first base, looked toward his teammates, 
turned to the crowd and lifted his cap and then did everything he could to 
fight off the tears. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly seemed possible, he thought to himself, but here he was in the ninth 
inning, having achieved a baseball by getting the 2,000th hit of his career in 
the Padres' 7-0 victory over the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton became just the 11th active player and only active shortstop to have 
gotten 2,000 career hits, joining Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs and Ken 
Griffey of the Cincinnati Reds as the only players in the group who didn't get 
any as a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
But as he was trying to soak in the atmosphere, wanting to celebrate along with 
everyone else, his mind was about a 1,000 miles away in Longview, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
This is the home of his 70-year-old father, Spiavia Templeton. Templeton knew 
his dad was watching the game on the TBS network. He had been talking about 
this occasion for weeks, reflecting back throughout his career that had begun 
14 years earlier to the day -- Aug. 9, 1976 -- when he obtained his first major 
league hit off Dan Larson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to call him first thing in the morning," Templeton said. "You know, 
if it wasn't for him, I would have given up this game years ago. I even told 
him once that I had to quit, that my knee was killing me. 
</P>
<P>
"But he was the one always pushing me. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm pushing him." 
</P>
<P>
A year that has emerged as one of the finest in Templeton's career has also 
been perhaps the most difficult one he has endured. 
</P>
<P>
Playing every day on a damaged left knee that has undergone three operations 
and hundreds of needles to drain fluid -- that, he can tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
Playing every day when people have told you that you were washed up years ago 
is rather satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Playing every day when your father is dying has been hell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair," Templeton said. "Here I am, feeling better than I ever even 
dreamed, and now he's having so many problems." 
</P>
<P>
Spiavia Templeton has been diagnosed as having an aneurysm in one of his heart 
valves. He desperately needs an operation, Templeton said, but at his age and 
his condition, doctors have said that there would be only a 12% chance of 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we can do right now," Templeton said, "but pray. He's going 
through a lot of pain. He's even in a wheelchair because his knees are so 
messed up. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes it so hard now. You try to stay focused. You try to 
concentrate when you go out on the field, and not think about him, but, boy, 
it's hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I do all right separating the two things, but as soon as I leave the game, as 
soon as I get into the clubhouse, that's all I think about. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in pretty good spirits, though. I make sure we talk every day. I always 
want to know how he's doing, and all he wants to know is what's wrong with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"But hopefully what I did tonight made him proud of me. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I couldn't be more proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
The same intensity and determination of Spiavia Templeton certainly can be 
found in his son. There was no way anyone figured Garry Templeton, 34, would 
remain the Padres' starting shortstop this long. Most thought he'd even be out 
of the game by now. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when the Padres provided him a contract in the off-season, they even 
told that to his face. They put playing incentives in the contract, you know, 
just to make it look good. Surely they wouldn't have to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
Guess what? They made their first payment Thursday, when Templeton earned a 
$25,000 bonus for playing in the 100th game. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be much more where that came from, too, considering that Padre Manager 
Greg Riddoch said before the game that not only is Templeton their starting 
shortstop the rest of this season, but they're also counting on him to start in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's why this means such a great deal to me," Templeton said. "There 
have been so many times that people have written me off. It was back in '83 
when people said I had only one year left. One year. 
</P>
<P>
"Now look at me, I've extended it six years. That's a great accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I still hear people saying how his knee is bad, and the Padres need 
a new shortstop. Well, if this leg keeps feeling the way it's feeling, and I 
lose a few pounds, there's no telling what can happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to hang around until they win a championship." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (51-59) aren't going to win any titles this year, but by winning 13 
of their past 18, they have moved within 12 1/2 games of the division-leading 
Cincinnati Reds, the closest they have been since July 5. 
</P>
<P>
But on the night when everyone was feeling giddy because of Templeton's 
achievement, first baseman Jack Clark -- who has carried the offense of late -- 
went down in the first inning with a strained hamstring. He's expected to miss 
the three-game series against the Houston Astros beginning tonight, and if 
those are the only games he misses, Riddoch said the Padres will feel quite 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Clark sustained the injury when he was about to round third base on the way to 
score; he felt a pop in the back of his leg and pulled up lame, although he was 
able to scramble back to the bag. He immediately left the game, hobbling back 
to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like some big safari hunt," catcher Mark Parent said, "and somebody 
got an elephant." 
</P>
<P>
Said Clark: "Hopefully, it's not anything serious. I don't feel that bad, but 
you never know with these things." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the injury to Clark and the pain he was enduring just walking to 
the team bus, it was a night he'll always remember, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I not only feel fortunate," Clark said, "but I feel honored to have played 
with Tempy. I played with two of the best in the game when I played with Ozzie 
(Smith) and him. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know, it's been 14 years, and he's still one of the best." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre starter Bruce Hurst pitched a six-hit shutout for the victory, the 17th 
shutout of his career. He raised his record to 7-8 and has yielded an 0.84 ERA 
the past four starts. So what did he want to talk about? His run-scoring single 
in the first inning. It not only was his first RBI of the season but the first 
of his career. In fact, he said, his last RBI was in 1976 when he played for 
the St. George (Utah) Flyers. "That was the hardest ball we hit all night, 
wasn't it?" Hurst said, laughing. "Tempe better watch it. Here I come." . . . 
Catcher Benito Santiago will start in tonight's game against the Astros, after 
batting .300 with a grand slam and seven RBIs in six games during his 
rehabilitation assignment at triple-A Las Vegas. . . . Third baseman Eddie 
Williams must clear irrevocable waivers when he is outrighted today to triple-A 
Las Vegas. If a team claims Williams on waivers, they automatically will 
acquire him. Earlier this season, the Padres passed three players through 
irrevocable waivers: outfielder Darrin Jackson, first baseman Rob Nelson and 
catcher Ronn Reynolds.

CARDS TIP CUBS, RUIN DICKSON'S DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Grossmont High pitcher Lance Dickson said he was a little nervous about 
his major league debut Thursday. Understandable, since a little over two months 
ago, Dickson, a 20-year-old left-hander, was a student at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson said he didn't pitch that well in a 3-1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals 
at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Not entirely so, Cubs Manager Don Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a decent outing," Zimmer said. "We're talking about a kid who was 
pitching in college two months ago." 
</P>
<P>
In his debut after an accelerated two-month climb through the minors, Dickson 
(0-1) yielded eight hits and three runs over six innings, striking out three 
and walking one. He got off to an interesting start, yielding a leadoff single 
to Rex Hudler, then picking Hudler off first and making the putout himself in a 
rundown. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't happy," Dickson said. "I made some bad pitches. I didn't make key 
pitches in key spots." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs' No. 1 draft choice out of Arizona, where he led the NCAA in 
strikeouts in with 141 in 119 2/3 innings, Dickson was sent to Class A Geneva, 
N.Y., then promoted to Class A Peoria, Ill., then to double-A Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
During those brief stays, Dickson was a combined 7-3 with a 0.94 earned run 
average and 111 strikeouts and 18 walks in 69 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
He was called up Tuesday for pitcher Shawn Boskie, who was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, who lost for the first time in six games and just the sixth in 23, 
didn't offer Dickson much offensive support. The Cardinals' Kent Hill, who was 
re-called from triple-A Louisville July 26, did not allow a hit until the sixth 
inning and had a two-hit shutout working until Jerome Walton's leadoff home run 
in the ninth. It was Walton's first homer since Aug. 8, 1989.

CSUN BASKETBALL ASSISTANT FEHTE TAKES POST WITH ST. MARY'S COLLEGE

Dave Fehte, an assistant basketball coach at Cal State Northridge for the past 
six seasons, said Thursday he has been hired as an assistant at St. Mary's 
College of the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
His departure leaves Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy with no assistants less than 
four months before the Matadors' season opener at Colorado on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Smith, a Northridge assistant for seven seasons, accepted a similar 
position at Eastern Washington University in June. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 35, had suggested that Fehte, 30, a part-time coach, be promoted to the 
vacant full-time position. But Fehte apparently felt he was unlikely to get the 
job, prompting his departure. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, Northridge's coach since 1971, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy has spent much of his time since the end of last season trying to fill 
a depleted roster in preparation for the program's move to NCAA Division I 
status this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Two starters, Derrick Gathers and Kris Brodowski, have used up their athletic 
eligibility while another starter, Kendell McDaniels, has dropped out of 
school. Bill Mazurie, Sandy Brown and Shanan Rosenberg also have left the team, 
which finished 12-15 overall and 7-7 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
play last season. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels, a 6-foot-4 forward/center from Chatsworth High, was the team's 
second-leading scorer (11.0 points a game) and rebounder (6.4) as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Mazurie, a 6-2 freshman guard from Capistrano Valley High, started in five 
games and averaged 7.3 points a game for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a 6-6 sophomore swingman from Manual Arts High, averaged 5.3 points a 
game, and Rosenberg, a 6-8 freshman from St. Francis High, averaged 3.1 points 
before being declared academically ineligible early in the CCAA season.

When Tim Hovland told Mike Dodd a month ago that he wanted to end their 
nine-year, professional volleyball union, he said he wanted to "dance with a 
new partner." 
</P>
<P>
Hovland has played exclusively with 22-year-old Kent Steffes since the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd has been dancing to the tune of "Hello, Goodby." 
</P>
<P>
Today at noon, when the $150,000 Cuervo Gold Crown tournament gets started at 
San Diego's Mission Bay, Dodd will be playing with his fifth different partner 
-- counting Hovland -- in as many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
For a man who was a steady sight for so many years standing on Hovland's right, 
the variety of the past few weeks has been exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really enjoyed this," Dodd said. "It's exciting getting the chance to 
play with someone with different skills each week." 
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, it was hello Dan Vrebalovich and goodby Hovland. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, it was hello Scott Ayakatubby and goodby Vrebalovich. 
</P>
<P>
And in Seal Beach, it was hello to fellow South Bay native Brent Frohoff and 
goodby Ayakatubby. 
</P>
<P>
Frohoff's regular partner, Karch Kiraly, is returning from television 
assignment at the Goodwill Games this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
So at Mission Bay, Dodd will greet partner No. 5: veteran Pat Powers. 
</P>
<P>
At least the lack of stability hasn't affected Dodd's game. He and Vrebalovich 
finished third at Cleveland, and Dodd-Frohoff -- a first-time union of two 
long-time buddies -- came in second at Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really looking forward to playing with Brent," Dodd said. "I've played a 
million pickup games with him down at Marine (Avenue in Manhattan Beach) and I 
had a feeling we'd do well." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd played on the left side with Frohoff -- his first time on that side in 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of weird," Dodd said. "No, it was very weird." 
</P>
<P>
Coming at Randy Stoklos from a different angle in Sunday's final, Dodd was able 
to score a few points simply out of newness. But Dodd and Frohoff had to come 
through the consolation bracket to reach the final, and a well-rested Sinjin 
Smith and Stoklos won their 10th tournament of the year, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy to come all the way back through the losers' bracket, but Sinjin 
and Randy were fresh as daisies," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd won't get too used to playing with Powers either. Dodd will be teamed with 
former Olympian Steve Timmons in next week's Seattle Seafair Open. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't know who his partner will be in the season-ending USA Championships 
of Pro Beach Volleyball at Hermosa Beach Aug. 25-26. 
</P>
<P>
It could be any of the above. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year I'll pick one guy and stay with him the whole year," Dodd said. 
"That's the only way to do it. It just didn't happen this year. But I really 
don't know who it will be." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Powers, who last played together in 1981, are the fourth-seeded team 
in this weekend's Gold Crown event, which is the final jewel in Cuervo's triple 
crown of big-money tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Stoklos have already won more than $300,000 between them this year, 
including the titles of the first two Cuervo events at Clearwater, Fla., and 
Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
No team has ever won all three events of the Cuervo Gold Crown. The winning 
team at Mission Bay will split $70,000, which will be delivered in gold coins 
to the event site by a Brinks armored car for Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
To pull off the clean sweep of the Cuervo events, Smith and Stoklos will have 
to survive the tournament's shotgun format. The top eight teams on the beach 
play a round-robin format, with the top two teams competing for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The unluckiest man in beach volleyball would have to be Ayakatubby, who was 
scheduled to play in San Diego with Dodd, then had to withdraw because of a 
dislocated ring finger on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
Ayakatubby suffered the injury last weekend while playing in the International 
Surf Festival's Six-Man beach tournament at Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It's just another setback in what has been a star-crossed three years for 
Ayakatubby, who was once Frohoff's regular sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
Ayakatubby suffered a severely herniated disc in his lower back that wiped out 
half of his 1988 season. The injury has recurred and Ayakatubby has had to skip 
a smattering of tournaments since because of back stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
He has also faced bouts of heat exhaustion, thwarting several promising 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
At least Patty Dodd won't have to worry about picking another partner this 
weekend in the Venice Beach Open. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd got a call this week to play with Lisa Strand -- who was a winner in Tokyo 
with Janice Opalinski -- but she decided to stay with Rita Crockett-Royster 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
Strand would have been Dodd's fourth partner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in limbo for awhile," Dodd said. "It was very stressful and difficult to 
make a decision. Going from partner to partner in one summer is kind of crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Crockett-Royster finished fourth last weekend at Pismo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
You might catch a look at some of beach volleyball's future standouts today at 
Marine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa High Coach Mike Cook -- the winningest volleyball coach in 
California history -- is running a boys' high school level two-man tournament 
today, beginning at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Five members of Cook's 1990 Mira Costa team -- which swept undefeated to the 
Southern Section 4-A Division title and the No. 1 ranking in the nation -- will 
be in action today. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Ceman -- who was Mira Costa's deluxe setter and class valedictorian -- 
and long-time partner David Swatik are one of the top teams in the tournament. 
Both Ceman and Swatik have AA ratings in the California Beach Volleyball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Cook is holding a co-ed open tournament, also at Marine Avenue. In 
its 23rd year, the tournament attracts players from the fringes of the men's 
and women's pro tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this year's players are Barry Hanna, Doug Foust, and Mike Doll -- all 
AAA-rated players who have seen action on the pro circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to pick up some girls and play," Cook said. "We've been doing it 
this way since 1968. This used to be a darn strong tournament before the men's 
pro tour got going."

WHEN THE CAMERAS ROLLED, SO DID DENMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What started as a two-week stint in California -- to accommodate his work as an 
extra in a remake of a Shirley Temple film -- has now become an 11-year stay 
for Rick Denman, 32, program director of the Encino Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
While an engineering student at the University of Michigan in 1979, Denman was 
recruited for his ability to ride on a banked, wooden indoor track that he 
frequented in nearby Southfield and that was moved to California for a scene in 
the film "Little Miss Marker." 
</P>
<P>
The indoor track in Michigan was banked at 58 degrees, compared to 34 degrees 
at Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills and 27 degrees at Encino 
Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
"That track was so steep that you could put your feet at the base and reach out 
and touch the wall," said Denman, who lives in North Hollywood. "There weren't 
too many people who could ride it or (were) willing to." 
</P>
<P>
By the time filming was over, Denman had become fascinated with the operation 
of motion-picture cameras and began answering casting calls requiring 
bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"As a competitive cyclist, I was able to understand the needs and the camera 
angles to document them realistically," said Denman, the winner of the points 
race in the 1982 Far West championships and who recently placed seventh in the 
masters national championships in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Denman's expertise gained the attention of the makers of the 1985 film 
"American Flyers." Denman fitted the bikes with cameras and rode the cycles 
while the bicycle footage was being filmed. He also was the technical 
coordinator for "Quicksilver," recruiting and training the actors and cyclists 
involved in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Denman, who was a coach at the 1987 U. S. Olympic Festival, has now helped 
coordinate more than 100 commercials, including the recent Miller Tour de Lite 
commercial in which he worked with the rap group RUN DMC and "Cheers" star 
Woody Harrelson. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is getting better and better all the time," Denman said. "There 
seem to be more and more offers. There have been no regrets (about leaving 
engineering) whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Cross-training: If Brad Kearns is in good cycling shape, there is a distinct 
possibility that he also will be in good triathlon condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout my career, when I'm doing well in all three areas, my cycling has 
been right up there," said Kearns, 25, who will compete in the National City 
Corp. triathlon in Cleveland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my training is on the bike. I spend about two to three hours' riding a 
day compared to only an hour running and in the pool. The cardiovascular 
effects of it transfers to my swimming and running." 
</P>
<P>
And lately, based upon recent performances, Kearns, a former Taft High 
cross-country and track standout, has been spending a lot of time on his wheels 
in preparation for the NCC, which will serve as the 1990 national championship 
for the Triathlon Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, who said that he often cycles as many as 300 miles a week during heavy 
training, won the Oxnard Sports Festival triathlon last month and the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center triathlon in June. In the latter, he topped a 
field that included Scott Tinley, the defending champion and four-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in Cleveland -- the competition consists of a 
1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer bike and 10-kilometer run -- will qualify for 
the world championships Sept. 15 at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Prize money totaling $20,000, including $3,500 for first place, will be at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll qualify, no problem," said Kearns, who plans to push the pace on 
the bike portion. "There's no holding back. The best times come when you go all 
out on the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time I: The leaders in the ninth Race Across America are nearing the 
halfway point of a 2,922-mile course that began Sunday in Irvine and will end 
sometime next week in Savannah, Ga. This year marks the first time the race 
will finish in Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
In which other cities has the race finished? 
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar bicyclists: A Working Man's division was launched at Encino 
Velodrome last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The new category is designed to supplement the existing four divisions and help 
promote parity among riders. Previously, the categories ranged from Division I 
(advanced) through Division IV (beginning). 
</P>
<P>
Denman said that in the Division III races, masters riders (age 30 and older) 
often were overmatched by former national-class riders in that age bracket. 
</P>
<P>
"It was instituted in order to keep the guys in the 40s and 50s coming back and 
at the same time keep the fields competitive," Denman said. "It also helps 
educate the newcomers from the working class with a lot of speed but no 
experience to hash it out against the real top pros." 
</P>
<P>
Seven riders participated in the Working Man's division last week and Denman is 
expecting a bigger turnout Saturday, including 10-time national champion and 
two-time Olympian (1972 and 1976) Ron Skarin of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Skarin, a gold medalist in the 1975 Pan American Games in the team pursuit, 
holds the world record for distance traveled in one hour in a human-powered 
vehicle (slightly more than 47 miles). 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time II: Which country has won the most consecutive gold medals in 
Olympic team-pursuit competition? 
</P>
<P>
Triple threat: Matt Rayner of the Montrose Cycle Club has been dominating 
competition for the omnium at Encino Velodrome the past two weeks and will be 
seeking his third consecutive title Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Points are awarded each night for three races -- the points race, the 
miss-and-out, and the scratch race. In winning the past two omniums, Rayner, 
27, of Sylmar, has won five of a possible six races. 
</P>
<P>
Rayner, a member of the 1987 national team pursuit champion, recently returned 
from competition in Europe. He is gearing up for the Madison national 
championships on Aug. 31 in Allentown, Pa., where he will team with Chris Gaido 
of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer I: Past RAAM routes, all of which originated in Orange County, 
ended in New York City; Atlantic City, N.J.; and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
In remembrance: A 10-mile race to commemorate one of the founders of Encino 
Velodrome will be held at the venue Aug. 25. The event will be coordinated by 
the San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kemp, 84, one of the founders of the nonprofit velodrome that was 
constructed in 1960, passed away last week after suffering a massive heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer II: Italy won the team-pursuit in four Olympiads, spanning the 
period from 1908 through 1920.

COMPETITION DISAPPEARS AS LARSON COASTS TO SINGLE-HANDED SAILING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado's David Houser trailed Morgan Larson by almost six points entering the 
final day of the O'Day U.S. single-handed sailing championships. So Larson, a 
sophomore at College of Charleston, knew he had better keep an eye on Houser. 
</P>
<P>
But first, he had to find him. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept looking for him so I could cover him, but he wasn't around," Larson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Larson learned after the first of Thursday's three races that Houser had been 
disqualified for running into another boat after the first lured mark. And his 
misfortune virtually handed Larson the O'Day trophy. 
</P>
<P>
With just two races remaining, Larson only had to finish one -- each competitor 
is allowed to drop his lowest finish of the series. Still, Larson went on to 
take fifth in Thursday's second race and second in the last of nine races. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with 11.25 points, while Houser, a junior at Coronado High and at 
16 the youngest of 14 competitors, took second with 22.25. Three-quarters of a 
point was given for first in each race, then two for second, three for third 
and so on, with the low total winning. Each race covered an approximate 
distance of 2.25 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nine races, Larson's lowest finish was seventh in his second race. He 
won three times, with three second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
"In a long regatta like this, it's consistency that wins," Larson said. "I just 
didn't make any big mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he left them for Houser. 
</P>
<P>
"As I went around the lured mark, I just had too much speed going for me," 
Houser said. "I was watching somebody else, and I wasn't paying attention to 
the guy in front of me. I thought, 'Oh no.' Because you can't clear yourself 
here. You only get one chance." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Houser said he was thankful for the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to get two firsts and a second to win," he said. "It would have 
been tough. But I'm happy with the way I sailed." 
</P>
<P>
Larson, who captured the collegiate single-handed championships last year, said 
familiarity helped him navigate the 14-foot Laser boats a little more easily. 
</P>
<P>
And the big lead after six races didn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little more comfortable," Larson said. "But then there's always the 
chance you can screw up, and then you look really stupid. That's why my goal 
was to sail my best race first, and after that I could coast." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's champion, Charles Pucciarello of Pensacola, Fla., figured to be in 
the hunt again. But he fouled out of five of nine races and finished 11th out 
of 14. Jason Rucker, the youth champion from Bedford, Tex., ended up sixth 
after being third heading into the final day. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Logan of Miami, who attends Old Dominion, was third with 24 points.

CHARGERS NOTEBOOK DON PATTERSON; 
</P>
<P>
NELSON BACK BECAUSE HE HAS THE RIGHT PART 
</P>

SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it's Dan Henning's powers of persuasion. Or maybe it's just that the game 
of football can be an awful lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Darrin Nelson keeps showing up. He came to the Chargers with 10 games 
remaining in the season last year when the Dallas Cowboys gave him up for a 
fifth-round draft choice, after the Minnesota Vikings had shipped him to Dallas 
for one game as part of the Herschel Walker trade. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the veteran running back thought about retiring. Why move the wife 
and kids from an area they like when he already had a good off-season career as 
a financial planner? Was it worth it to pack up and join a team that was 
stumbling through the season? 
</P>
<P>
"The whole Dallas trade just got to me to the point where I said 'I don't need 
this stuff,' " he said. "I was kind of thinking about (retiring) before I even 
came out here." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he decided to give it a go and wound up having a great time, coming in 
often on third downs and occasionally on first, always looking to make a big 
play. Using his intelligence and jitterbug moves, Nelson averaged 5.5 yards a 
carry and 10.6 yards a catch. In general, though he might not have busted his 
tail on weekdays, he was productive on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
"Very accountable player on Sundays," Henning said. "He played a hell of a lot 
better (on Sundays) than he did in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson admits playing for the Chargers wound up being preferable to playing in 
Minnesota, where he said the atmosphere was a bit tense. Still, during the 
off-season, thoughts of retirement began to run through his head once again. 
Nine years in this business, and you begin to ponder self-preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"This game," Nelson said, "is really violent." 
</P>
<P>
Henning gave him a call in the off-season and told him the Chargers were very 
interested in having him back. Anyway, as Henning points out, Nelson makes a 
good deal more money playing football than he does as a nine-to-fiver. 
</P>
<P>
And the Chargers' offense is perfect for him. He can let the big guy, Marion 
Butts, all 248 pounds of Marion Butts, do the punishing stuff. He'll take his 
185 pounds and stay away from those redwood-sized linebackers, thanks. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so much fun last year," he said. "It's a whole new role for me coming in 
on third down. I wasn't in a position where I got really beat up a lot or 
anything. So I could enjoy the game a little more." 
</P>
<P>
So Darrin Nelson is back this season, a little bored with his ninth training 
camp but looking ahead to 16 more Sundays. More fun without a suit and tie. And 
certainly, he is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We like him," Henning said. "We're convinced that he can help us." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the main event. In this corner, weighing 250 pounds, we have inside 
linebacker Cedric Figaro. In the far corner, checking in at 245 pounds, we have 
tight end Andy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Quick fight, though maybe no quicker than Tyson-Spinks. It was the second day 
in a row that two Chargers got into a scrape in practice. Wednesday's bout was 
between rookie Frank Cornish, a center/guard from UCLA, and veteran inside 
linebacker Gary Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
Henning's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of like one a day," he said, smiling. "It's like vitamin pills." 
</P>
<P>
Only problem with Thursday's was that Parker had to be treated for what was 
officially termed "a mouth injury." 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Arthur Cox, who suffered a back sprain in Wednesday's practice, will 
likely miss Saturday's exhibition with Dallas. Others injured this week who 
will miss the game are H-back Craig McEwen (hand), guard Chris Goetz 
(arthroscopic elbow surgery) and tackle Joey Howard (arthroscopic knee 
surgery). 
</P>
<P>
Despite multiple injuries on the offensive line, the Chargers aren't having any 
success locating replacements. Joel Patten, Leo Goeas and Howard are out, but 
General Manager Bobby Beathard says the Chargers will have to make do with what 
they have for now. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a shortage of them that there just aren't any out there," he 
said. "There are a lot of teams in the same position."

<P>
Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport took the court for her quarterfinal singles match 
Thursday feeling a little too soft-hearted toward her opponent, and it nearly 
cost her in the United States Tennis Assn. Girls' 16s National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Facing sixth-seeded Katie Schlukebir of Kalamazoo, Mich., Davenport dropped the 
first set, 6-1, before she came back to overpower Schlukebir, 6-3, 6-1, and 
advance to today's semifinals at Morley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a good friend of mine," said Davenport, who conceded she opened 
tentatively because of that. "We've warmed up together all week. We warmed up 
together today, even though we were playing each other." 
</P>
<P>
But Davenport isn't about to let a little friendship stand in the way of a 
possible national championship. Of the four players -- including La Jolla's 
Ditta Huber -- who advanced to today's 11:30 a.m. semifinals, Davenport is the 
hottest. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past two months, she has won singles titles at the National Clay 
Court championships and Seventeen Magazine invitational tourney. Davenport, who 
turned 14 in June and stands 6-feet-2, won the girls' 16s singles draw at the 
Ojai Invitational in April and claimed both singles and doubles titles in the 
1989 USTA Girls' 14s National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Davenport will face fourth-seeded Lisa Pugliese of Boca Raton, Fla., today. 
Pugliese defeated Kimberly Kozlowski of Sarasota, Fla., 6-2, 6-4. No. 8 Amy 
Chiminello of Mecrose, Mass., a 6-4, 6-3 winner over Diana Spadea of Boca 
Raton, Fla., will face the last of four San Diego-area players still alive, 
third-seeded Huber. 
</P>
<P>
Huber, like Davenport, considers herself a slow starter, but she has won five 
straight-set matches since the tournament started Sunday, including Thursday's 
6-4, 6-4 defeat of No. 5 Tiffany Gates of Grandville, Mich. The most crucial 
victory for Huber was also her most lopsided, a 6-1, 6-1 blowout Wednesday of 
14th-seeded Valerie Poulos of Boston. Poulos defeated Huber three weeks ago at 
the clay court nationals, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Huber had no trouble with Gates, only the large crowd at Morley Field's stadium 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"People were talking pretty loud, and it was hard not to hear some of the 
conversations in the beginning," Huber said. "Everything just echoed." 
</P>
<P>
While Huber and Davenport are both hoping to reach Saturday's 11:30 a.m. 
singles final, where they would oppose each other, they will play together in 
today's 2:30 p.m. doubles semifinals. Huber and Davenport, seeded first, will 
face unseeded Cindy Kuragami of Buena Park and Heidi Steiber of Bakersfield.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / ACURA NSX: A $100,000 HONDA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Berlin Wall has crumbled to paperweights, reading presidential lips 
suddenly became as unreliable as reading minds, and Southern California real 
estate is no longer a platinum hedge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet here's the absolute shocker of an audacious year: a Honda that costs 
$60,000. Or $64,000 with automatic. 
</P>
<P>
But only if you own the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Tightly limited supplies of the new, pivotal, radical and very rapid 
Honda/Acura NSX sports car already have created a scalper's market. Only 5,000 
of the cars will be made this year, and only 3,000 of those will come to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
So offers of $100,000 are being whispered. A physician in Tennessee, according 
to AutoWeek magazine, is offering his first place on a dealer's NSX waiting 
list for $33,000. A Florida broker is ready to pay dealers $10,000 above their 
sticker prices. 
</P>
<P>
It's a repeat of Miata Mania -- yet a display of frantics that will surprise 
only those who still believe Japanese automobile manufacturers make unemotional 
motorcycles, build super gasoline generators and really know how to recycle 
lawn mowers into commuter cars. 
</P>
<P>
The truth of this matter: 
</P>
<P>
Honda's maiden vehicle exports were two motorcycles shipped to Okinawa in 1957. 
That was three years before Nissan came to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the short generation since: 
</P>
<P>
* Of all new automobiles sold in California, 50% are imported. When it comes to 
reliable, thrifty, pretty, zippy, little imported cars, Japan owns the 
showroom. 
</P>
<P>
* Lexus and Infiniti have grabbed the luxury performance car market by the 
lapels. Mercedes, Jaguar and BMW aren't exactly shaking in their Connelly 
leather britches, but the big dogs are reducing prices or introducing less 
expensive entry-level vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
* Now comes a hefty sports car, the fastest, most expensive Japanese car ever, 
to raid and plunder the stables of Ferrari and Porsche, builders of lusty 
exotics that offer performance close to the speed of thought. 
</P>
<P>
And the Acura NSX, this car that will be king of Acura, Honda's upscale 
division, is offering easily in its first year what others have struggled to 
deliver after more than four decades of development. 
</P>
<P>
The competition are gladiators all. From Italy, weighing in at $103,000, the 
Ferrari 348. From Germany, where the motor car was born a century ago, the 
Porsche 911 Carrera at $72,000. From the United States, wearing skinned 
knuckles and drinking Budweiser from the can, comes the Corvette ZR-1 at 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier cultures, these cars would be considered talismans to be buried 
alongside their masters. Top speeds usually exceed a driver's weight. They are 
useless for anything but going fast and reminding the self-indulgent of their 
limitations. They certainly do not kiss back. 
</P>
<P>
The NSX snarls with the baddest. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it doesn't roar louder than the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
Externally, from any view, whether seeing styling or examining aerodynamic 
design, the NSX is superb and doubtless one of the most handsome cars ever. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin-forward design starts with a short nose and a gentle slope reserved 
for high-performance vehicles built to slide beneath and shove aside 
obstructive air. Just like a Group C racing car. 
</P>
<P>
Amidships -- and for the full length of the doors -- twin horizontal lines 
leading to rear fuselage air scoops visually lower the car and accent its 
Nutra-Slim look. 
</P>
<P>
The roof line resembles a canopy, and the rear rises to an aerofoil; the 
profile is of a jet fighter's vertical stabilizer. That's no accident: In its 
search for the optimum silhouette of speed and purpose, Acura researched 
America's aeronautical designs, in particular General Dynamics' F-16 Fighting 
Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
From an engineering standpoint, the NSX is probably a decade ahead of its time. 
Here is a car with an all-aluminum monocoque body and subframe, and at 460 
pounds, the chassis weighs less than a sumo wrestling tag team. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension is cast aluminum (mounted on a nice piece of walnut, the 
wishbones would make sensational bookends), with a unique, additional strut to 
prevent the front wheels from kicking out of true when riding road bumps. 
</P>
<P>
The engine uses lighter, stronger (and frightfully expensive) titanium 
connecting rods. There's also something called a Variable Valve Timing and Lift 
Electronic Control System (VTEC), an automatic orchestration of cams and 
valves. In essence, it creates a 20-horsepower reserve that is uncorked only 
when the car's performance must graduate from serious to competitive. On 
fighter aircraft, it used to be called combat boost. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is five-star and flawless. Leather-covered seats are closer to 
custom chairs with a full, but unobtrusive shoulder support for tighter turns. 
These are better than the most expensive custom seats by Recaro. 
</P>
<P>
Vision would only be better if your head were inside a goldfish bowl. There's 
even clear sighting to back corners and directly behind the car, a weak spot 
among mid-engined cars that traditionally have had gun slits for rear windows. 
</P>
<P>
The engine note is a ripper. The shifter couldn't be smoother in buttermilk. 
Headroom is just enough for anyone 6-foot-4. There's sufficient luggage space 
for a weekend away with even overdressed beloveds, although the trunk is set 
against the engine, so be prepared for hot baggage. Or it may be used to warm 
take-out lasagna. 
</P>
<P>
Only one fault: Lighting is dim on digital displays telling the driver what the 
radio and climate controls are supposed to be doing. In sunlight, they 
disappear entirely. 
</P>
<P>
But with its thinner air bag fabric (for a smaller lump in the steering wheel) 
to automatic traction control (which completely tames the overcontrol buffoon 
in all of us), the car is a technological marvel. 
</P>
<P>
If only Honda/Acura had moved a little faster. 
</P>
<P>
For the NSX was conceived in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Its announced targets at that time were the Porsche 911, the Chevrolet Corvette 
and the Ferrari 328. And the Acura NSX clearly is superior to all three. 
</P>
<P>
But they were cars of seven years ago, and in the development cycle since, 
Porsche has produced the all-wheel drive Carrera 4. Chevrolet built a day of 
thunder it called the ZR-1. And Ferrari recently began selling the 348ts. 
</P>
<P>
We have driven them all. 
</P>
<P>
The NSX generally is superior in engineering, design and technology, but only a 
peer in performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the hands of the average to better driver, nothing corners sweeter, flatter 
and safer than the all-wheel Carrera 4. The NSX is only a rear-wheel drive 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
No sports car offers more muscle for the buck than the Corvette ZR-1. The NSX 
isn't quite so quick from zero to 60 m.p.h. and has a slightly slower top 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari 348ts can claim an identical edge at the top end. And in its maiden 
year, the NSX cannot possibly match the 40-year racing heritage, mystique, 
exclusivity and visceral appeal of Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Acura's 3-liter engine and 270 horsepower were a significant threat to 
the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1990, that engine has lightened a little alongside the 3.4 liters (290 
horsepower) of Ferrari, the 3.6 liters (247 horsepower) of Porsche and the 3.5 
liters (375 horsepower) of the Corvette ZR-1. 
</P>
<P>
Acura officials have heard the comparisons, express no concerns and counter 
with some acceptable arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The ZR-1, they said, survives only on brute strength. Handling is coarse, and 
the fit and finish barely American average. 
</P>
<P>
Porsche Carrera? A tired, 25-year-old design, they said, on the life-support 
system of modern technology. Also more expensive than the NSX. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari 348ts? A purist's car and a hard drive. And twice as expensive as the 
NSX. 
</P>
<P>
Would that our road test could have produced an honest conclusion. Or, at the 
very least, some understanding of the near-total canonization of the NSX by 
automotive magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But our test car had been their test car. 
</P>
<P>
It was production prototype 007 that had been ridden hard and put away wet by 
motoring journalists from the United States, Canada and Japan. Even dealers got 
to lap this one at 150-m.p.h. So, at 4,400 miles, the car was close to the end 
of its career as a performance punching bag. 
</P>
<P>
But we took the NSX to Willow Springs Raceway anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of its heart remained to be impressive on some smart laps of the 
facility's secondary circuit, the tight, often tortuous Streets of Willow 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The car has grip and balance, and when its ends get loose, the wagging is both 
predictable and correctable. 
</P>
<P>
Even adjusting to the car's oversteer snap-roll (created when over-correcting a 
drifting tail, failing to catch lateral forces and blushing when stored energy 
whips the car in the opposite direction), quickly becomes a reflex because the 
buildup and release is so constant. 
</P>
<P>
The steering, which is unassisted, seemed a little on the thick side, and that 
created a heavy turn-in. And there was a constant understeer. 
</P>
<P>
But on the highway, lightness and feel return, and the register is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Track. Highway. Those dual personalities, and the broad division between polite 
jogger and Olympic athlete, is the enormous gift of the Acura NSX. 
</P>
<P>
In traffic, around town, harumphing through clotted freeways or settled down on 
a pleasant and legal run along the coast to Santa Barbara, the NSX is relaxed 
and terribly smooth. It is a touring car. 
</P>
<P>
But when the going gets tough and the tough get rambunctious, quick shifts and 
a heavy foot unleash that extra horsepower in the higher engine ranges. And the 
NSX becomes a race car. 
</P>
<P>
Then that mid-engine sets up serious wails behind a driver's right ear and the 
moment rises to a breathtaking blur in search of a checkered flag. It is pure 
performance, even Ferrari pace, and certainly with Porsche's poise. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, being a Ferrari for the masses most certainly isn't a bad place to 
occupy. Especially when one considers that Acura has earned that heady spot in 
the Major Leagues from its first at bat. 
</P>
<P>
Honda officials acknowledge that with huge development costs and limited 
production numbers, the NSX -- which goes on sale Wednesday -- will not be a 
money maker. But they do expect it to be an image-enhancer for the Acura line. 
</P>
<P>
It also is worth noting that Porsche, Ferrari and Chevrolet are not known for 
nimbleness of product development. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese car builders are. 
</P>
<P>
And senior types at Honda are not reluctant to discuss tomorrow's NSX, 
enlarging that V-6, adding turbocharging and all-wheel drive -- and noting how 
quickly they can bring a second generation NSX to market. 
</P>
<P>
Then watch out.

Back at You: Environmental activist Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald and Nancy 
Reagan, has taken to TV to blast her father's presidency. On an episode of "A 
Current Affair" airing today, Davis says: "My sense of grief and helplessness 
increased when I learned that the Reagan Administration had allowed 20,500 
dolphins a year to be killed." But in an unrelated magazine interview in which 
the former President took on critics of his wife, Reagan said: "People in the 
political world who want to whack away will do so if they can also find a 
family member to lay it on."

Moving Day: Signs of the Middle East crisis turn up in the strangest places. 
Early Wednesday a Hertz rental truck pulled onto the sidewalk at the Four 
Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C., and movers began loading at least 100 pieces 
of luggage as Saudi Prince Turki Bin Faisal and his family cut short their 
vacation to return home. The prince had taken over 13 rooms at the expensive

North's Never: Iran-Contra figure Oliver North says he has no plans to run for

Revelations: Kitty Dukakis said in her book, "Now You Know," that she turned to 
her addictions in panic in 1988 when she realized her husband, Michael Dukakis, 
might be President. "On a typical day, I would rise, wait till my husband left, 
and by 9 o'clock in the morning, cancel all my appointments. I would go to the 
liquor cabinet in the dining room, measure out three or four ounces of straight 
spirits, and drink it down. Then I'd go upstairs, shut the blinds, unplug the 
phone, and read until I passed out."

PALE TALE SUFFERS LUCKLESS ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heroine of this wan novel -- "Catching the Light," by Susan L. Pope -- is 
so blond and fair-skinned that "folks in North Osprey who didn't know better 
called Damaris Bishop albino," despite her intensely blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Even folks who do know better might reasonably decide that Damaris' physical 
pallor could be meant as a metaphor for her oddly affectless personality, since 
events that would precipitate passionate reaction in most people seem to leave 
Damaris virtually untouched. In many ways, she's exactly like the beach glass 
she collects -- bland and smooth; the color leached out, all jagged edges worn 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Damaris was orphaned at the age of 3 when her parents were killed while on 
their way to an exhibit of glassworks. Left with her paternal grandparents by 
her glass-blower father and art-teacher mother, she has been dutifully brought 
up by them, a circumstance that sets her apart from her contemporaries. We're 
told she's rebellious, although even her rebellions seem curiously mild, like 
leaving a picnic without permission or hiding out in the back yard. When she's 
a junior in high school, her revolt takes a somewhat more dramatic turn: She 
falls in love with a temporary resident of the town, a young man from a barren 
island off the coast of Maine who has taken a job with the same elderly glass 
blower who taught her father the craft. 
</P>
<P>
Logan Perth is darkly handsome, artistic and extremely reticent; qualities 
Damaris finds irresistible. She trails him around the Cape Cod village, peers 
through the glassworks windows to watch him work, and eventually inveigles him 
out to her favorite marsh, the picturesque spot where her father proposed to 
her mother. There, she and Logan share wine, sandwiches and their DNA in what 
must be the most low-key love scene in contemporary fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is romantic," he says, drawing her close. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, Damaris discovers she's pregnant. She tells her grandfather, 
but chooses not to confide in Logan, who returns to his Penobscot Bay island 
unaware that the picnic on the marsh has had so significant an outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Life in her grandparents' farmhouse becomes untenable after Damaris refuses 
either to inform Logan or enter a Boston home for unwed mothers. Although this 
is 1960 and not a century earlier, her grandfather actually says: "Never cross 
my threshold again. The crossing of thresholds . . . that's reserved for 
brides." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with this ultimatum, Damaris drops out of high school and moves into 
Logan's old room at Josie Santos' boarding house, paying a tiny rent and 
helping out with the chores. She soon makes herself indispensable, while Josie, 
a warm-hearted Portuguese widow, supplies the understanding and support the 
Bishops couldn't offer. 
</P>
<P>
After an uneventful pregnancy, Damaris has an adorable little boy, who quickly 
becomes the darling of all the elderly residents. One of these, an ancient poet 
with a few secrets of her own, takes a special fancy to our heroine and decides 
Logan must know about his son. She writes to the father, and as a result, 
Damaris is invited by Logan to bring the baby to the island, a plan she 
acquiesces to as calmly as she's done everything else. 
</P>
<P>
The place is more wretched and primitive than she could possibly have imagined, 
and after her child almost dies of pneumonia, her passivity is replaced by 
determination. In short order, she returns to civilization, acquires a true, if 
somewhat eccentric, friend, and embarks upon a genetically determined career, 
one in which she, like the author, will need all the luck she can get.

DEAR HOT: I love leggings, but I'm extremely conscious of my legs -- they're 
really skinny (my brothers used to call me Olive Oyl, OK?). Is there any way I 
can wear leggings this fall and not look like a toothpick? 
</P>
<P>
 -- N.G., Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
DEAR N.G.: Don't despair, there's a solution that will pump up your legs 
without leaving you looking like Bluto. Printed leggings are expected to be all 
the rage this fall, and they also create an optical illusion, making your legs 
seem heavier. Elaborate paisleys, large floral designs, geometrics, even Pucci 
prints are decorating legs this season. 
</P>
<P>
A plaid pair (pictured) by Tapemeasure sells for $52, and you don't even have 
to roll your gams into a store to get them. They're from the Saks Fifth Avenue 
1990 fall Folio catalogue. According to Patricia Fox, director of fashion and 
marketing for Saks Beverly Hills, "We feel printed, patterned leggings will be 
very strong this fall. Since skirts are so short -- they look like hand towels 
-- it's important that the leg be covered with something opaque, either printed 
leggings or ribbed knit stockings." 
</P>
<P>
Merchandise from the Saks catalogue can be ordered by calling: (800) 345-3454. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: When I shop in malls it's not long before I become exhausted from 
going from store to store trying on clothes. My brain suffers from sensory 
overload looking at everything, and then I get cranky. Is this just me or is 
this a common problem? I love to shop, so I'm curious to know if there's 
anything I can do about this. 
</P>
<P>
 -- K.Z., Manhattan Beach 
</P>
<P>
DEAR K.Z.: This sometimes happens to us too, especially after listening to 
people trying out the merchandise at piano and organstores. So, to check out 
remedies for mall fatigue, we checked with an architect/urban designer who 
studies these things. 
</P>
<P>
Stefanos Polyzoides, associate professor of architecture at USC, says that if 
you tire while moseying through the mall, it's best to go to a section away 
from shopping. Then relax and people-watch. Or have a snack. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks it's even better if this area has some natural elements, such as 
plants, fresh air, a fountain or, perhaps, sunlight coming through skylights. 
In fact, Polyzoides doesn't really care for malls because, he claims, most of 
them are "destroying traditional public street experiences. They don't have 
sidewalks, birds, shady places and sunlit places. They're not active urban 
areas. They're shopping traps." 
</P>
<P>
There are those of us who thrive in such traps. But if mall fatigue is becoming 
chronic, try some outdoor street shopping. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT SHOPPERS: How do you deal with mall fever? While you're scooping up 
the last of the summer sales, sorting through the new fall styles and trying to 
coordinate back-to-school wardrobes that don't include Simpsons T-shirts, how 
do you cope? Send us your shopping strategies and we'll print the most amazing 
ones in a future column. 
</P>
<P>
WE BRAKE FOR SHOPPERS -- Hot to Shop recently spotted a license plate frame 
with a message near and dear to our hearts: "I graduated from Cal State 
Nordstrom."

The Centro Cultural de la Raza will present "La Boda" (The Wedding) by the 
nationally known group Teatro Nuestro, with the musical group Sandunga, at 8 
p.m. Aug. 24. In the play, the Sanchez family grapples with a daughter's 
pesticide poisoning and her father's threatened deportation. . . . The National 
Theatre for Children, which had planned a December performance of "Babes in 
Toyland" at the now-to-be-demolished California Theatre, has rescheduled for 
Dec. 13 and 14 at the Spreckels Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a 32-city tour running Nov. 10-Dec. 19. Auditions will be held 
Sept. 16-17 at the Golden Hill Recreation Center. Call 544-1804 for more 
information. . . . The producers of "The KPUG Talk Radio Murder Mystery" may 
have a genuine media personality to play the part of the talk-radio host. 
Contracts have not yet been signed, but it looks as if Larry Mendte, Channel 
8's stand-up comic weatherman, will star beginning Sept. 14 at the new Town and 
Country Playhouse at the Town and Country Hotel. . . . Spike Sorrentino, the 
newly named artistic director of the San Diego Junior Theatre, will be on 
double duty at the Lawrence Welk Resort Theatre soon. He will play Nathan 
Detroit in the Welk's upcoming production of "Guys and Dolls". . . . Holly 
Hughes, an artist denied a National Endowment for the Arts grant, will perform 
her elegy for her mother, "World Without End," at Sushi Performance Gallery on 
Dec. 6-9 and 12-16. Sushi originally presented the show in a workshop 
production as part of its Neofest program last May. Sushi is still planning to 
schedule another of the artists denied grants, Karen Finley, in the spring, 
managing director Vicki Wolf said.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: GASLAMP ANNOUNCES PLANS TO RESUME 
ITS 1990 SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company is about$31,000 away from resuming -- and 
concluding -- its 1990 season in November at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre, 
with the long-planned San Diego premiere of Terrence McNally's off-Broadway 
hit, "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune." 
</P>
<P>
That was the figure given this week by the Gaslamp's managing director, Kit 
Goldman, and its board of trustees president, George Saadeh. 
</P>
<P>
Even earlier, in mid-October, the company intends to resume the 1990 season at 
its second, smaller space, the Elizabeth North Theatre, as a co-producer of the 
Ensemble Arts Theatre production of "Dusk to Dawn at the Sunset" by Terry Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp, which is in its 10th season, suspended operations in May when a 
long-accumulated financial deficit reached a critical state. During the 
intervening months, the organization has rented out both its venues, providing 
revenues that, along with fund raising, have replenished the theater company's 
coffers sufficiently to schedule the reopenings, Saadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp has also been helped by a reduced rental fee negotiated with the 
limited partners that own the Hahn. Until this summer, the Gaslamp paid a 
back-breaking $10,146 a month for the 250-seat facility; it now pays half that. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear, however, whether resuming the season at the smaller venue will 
influence the outcome of a dispute with former patron Elizabeth North, who 
pledged $75,000 in exchange for the Gaslamp naming the theater after her. When 
operations were suspended last spring, North withheld the final $35,000 
installment of her pledge, saying she would not donate the money until the 
theater resumed operations. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is also studying a restructuring plan written by Harris Goldman (no 
relation to Kit), a consultant who was the former executive producer at 
Starlight Musical Theatre. He would not comment on the plan except to say that 
he is "very optimistic in terms of the Gaslamp's future." 
</P>
<P>
"We have most of the money in hand," Saadeh said, referring to what is needed 
for the two upcoming productions. "But we like to do everything very cautiously 
now. The bottom line is that the theater has to run like a business. It may not 
come back like a boomerang. It is going to come out slowly but wisely." 
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the money needed for the 1991 season -- a figure no one is 
willing to name -- still needs to be raised, but Kit Goldman and Saadeh hope 
the fund raising will be easier when the theater is producing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a chicken-and-egg situation," Goldman said. "Two of the things major 
funders want to see is that we can do quality work and sell tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, investors are likely to be looking closely at the Gaslamp's 
choices. The theater has acquired a reputation for bland, monochromatic period 
pieces during the past few years. Although its plays invariably have been 
skillfully done, they failed to bring in ample audiences, dropping to about 50% 
at the Hahn last season. 
</P>
<P>
While Goldman said she is not sure whether she will be changing her title, she 
is, however, changing her job. The board of trustees is interviewing managing 
director candidates to handle the business matters that used to be Goldman's 
responsibility. And Goldman, who this spring fired her original artistic 
director and co-founder, Will Simpson, will continue to make artistic choices. 
</P>
<P>
Both Saadeh and Goldman said the Ensemble Arts Theatre production of "Dusk to 
Dawn at the Sunset" is the sort of production they hope to be known for in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a slice of life from the Southwest, exploring the relationships between 
families," Saadeh said. "It fits in well with what we want to offer our 
subscribers." Ensemble Arts Theatre is now touring "Dusk to Dawn at the Sunset" 
at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said that, more than a change in content, the significance of "Dusk to 
Dawn at the Sunset" may be that it is a new show and a cooperative venture with 
another company. She predicted more co-productions of new works at the 
Elizabeth North and less at the Hahn. And, with the possible exception of 
"Tales From Tinseltown," a new musical under consideration for the Hahn in 
1991, most of the work there will already have a track record even if it is new 
to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Along with "Tales From Tinseltown," proposed to the Gaslamp by New York 
producers Celso Gonzalez-Falla and his wife, Sondra Gilman, other shows under 
consideration are "Oil City Symphony," canceled last season, and "The 
Debutante," a black Pygmalion story set in turn-of-the-century Philadelphia and 
commissioned by Goldman for her own independent production company. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fund raising and rentals continue. The Gaslamp's next celebrity 
staged reading stars Harold Gould at the Hahn Cosmopolitan on Sept. 24. 
Upcoming rentals at the Hahn include the new musical "I Wanna-Be," Aug. 
17-Sept. 9, and the Oct. 11-Nov. 4 run of "Family Secrets," a one-woman show 
starring Sheri Glaser and directed by Robyn Samuels. At the Elizabeth North, 
rentals include the San Diego Actors Theatre, which will produce 
"Eleeomosynary" beginning tonight, and "Party Favors," a new play by local 
playwright Mark Melden, opening in September.

lawsuitsomething: MGM-UA Television Production Group sued CBS Wednesday in an 
attempt to block the network from broadcasting a movie starring Kenneth Olin 
during the season premiere week of an ABC series Olin stars in -- 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court lawsuit said CBS knew when it hired Olin to star in "The 
Charles Stuart Murders" that Olin's contract with MGM-UA carries an exclusivity 
restriction. The restriction bars Olin from making any guest appearances in 
programs to be broadcast during the season's premiere week of "thirtysomething" 
or opposite any first run broadcast of an episode of the series. CBS intends to 
broadcast "The Charles Stuart Murders" Sept. 18 in a time slot opposite the 
fall premiere of "thirtysomething."

POPS SERVES UP A U.S. TRADITION: RUSSIAN MUSIC

<P>
Long before glasnost, Americans had a hearty appetite for Russian music. When 
Carnegie Hall opened a century ago, for example, Tchaikovsky inaugurated the 
house, and, during World War II, the symphonies of Shostakovich flooded 
American radio waves. There must be some irony in the fact that American 
orchestras still play more Russian music than home-grown compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's San Diego Symphony Pops concert under guest conductor Norman 
Leyden wallowed in ripe Russian repertory. Leyden's menu of Rachmaninoff and 
Rimsky-Korsakov, with Borodin for dessert, drew a sizable (2,433) midweek crowd 
that remained surprisingly attentive by comparison with the typical chatty 
Hospitality Point audience. 
</P>
<P>
In Leyden's spirited reading of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Capriccio Espagnol" that 
opened the program, the orchestra sounded fresh and robust. Among the host of 
deft solos, acting concert master Nick Grant's stylish, assured solo flights 
stood out. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" outdoors was a 
gamble, and, sure enough, a plane roared overhead just as guest pianist Steven 
Mayer was coaxing the arch-romantic slow theme out of the Yamaha grand. 
</P>
<P>
A pianist with immaculately clean articulation and a percussive attack, Mayer 
displayed ample technique to subdue the Rachmaninoff with dispatch. 
Unfortunately, he tended to rush the first part of each measure, which kept him 
slightly ahead of the orchestra much of the time. The close amplification of 
the piano, of course, only exacerbated this annoying problem. Nor did it help 
that Leyden had a more generous, flexible approach to the composer's style, 
while Mayer pressed relentlessly forward with analytic determination. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing his Rachmaninoff, this reviewer would rather hear Mayer play 
Hindemith or Stockhausen. 
</P>
<P>
The program's second half required little introspection from the listeners. 
After Rachmaninoff's lush Adagio from the Symphony No. 2 in E Minor, Leyden and 
the orchestra polished off Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumble Bee" and the 
"Polovetsian Dances" by Borodin. In spite of a reduced number of strings, the 
orchestra gave a warm, effulgent account of these familiar baubles. Leyden's 
stiff conducting style may not be the picture of finesse on the podium, but 
it's difficult to quarrel with the refined results from the players.

ROE RETURNS TO TAKE LEAD FOR LO-TEC

Three's Company co-founder Betzi Roe has made it her mission to collect modern 
dance solos by talented yet underexposed choreographers. The style and artistic 
focus among them varies considerably, but all of the dance makers have two 
things in common. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all women, and they all work in California," Roe said. "I felt 
California women were making good work that doesn't get seen much. And I 
thought (their dances) would make a good journey through the contemporary 
woman's perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Roe has performed this potpourri -- called "California Women Dancing" -- during 
myriad guest appearances throughout the country. The dances have even been seen 
in the Soviet Union, where Roe made historic inroads three years ago as the 
first U.S. State Department "cultural specialist" in modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, when Roe goes solo in the Lo-Tec Series at Three's Company's 
studio in Hillcrest, there will be three new works by California women on the 
program. But there will also be a couple of premieres that are not part of the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing two works by men," Roe said, "and not all the choreography is from 
California. That's why I'm calling this concert 'The Next Step.' This time the 
dancing is very different -- and very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The women's (choreography) is very physical and the men's are gentle. But 
these are all very idiosyncratic works. I have had to retrain, and my body will 
probably give up on me, but I won't give up." 
</P>
<P>
Going it alone for a full evening is taxing enough to discourage most young 
dancers from programming solo concerts. But Roe, 42, feels she's in her prime 
as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the best shape of my life," she said. "I work out three hours a day, 
running and weightlifting. But this concert is a real challenge because the 
styles are all so difficult and unusual for me. I do back slips and jazzy moves 
that I never used to do." 
</P>
<P>
Taking on new challenges is not new to Roe. When she made her first of four 
trips to the Soviet Union to teach modern dance, she was "the first female solo 
performer in the Soviet Union since Isadora Duncan," who visited in the 1920s, 
Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
For Roe's "Next Step" concert, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m., 
she will also showcase one of her own works, along with five designed by her 
colleagues. All are San Diego debuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a nice little piece from Suzie Goldman, a former Alwin Nikolais 
dancer," Roe said, "and I'm doing Susan Rose's 'In the Works.' They've both 
been critically acclaimed. Bill Conrow made a new dance and Lonne Moretton 
created something for me. I don't know how it will turn out." 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Gieliland's slinky and sultry solo, titled "To a KD Lang," is also on 
tap for Roe's return to Lo-Tec this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so delighted to be dancing in San Diego again after a two-year absence," 
Roe said. "But I have to admit, I'm very nervous about this concert. It's my 
biggest challenge."

'AIR AMERICA' STALLS IN FINDING ITS FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be said that Vietnam was the great undeclared war both in real life 
and on the screen. Until the last decade or so, the war was virtually absent 
from our screens. Now, of course, it's rare that a month goes by without some 
Vietnam-themed feature or television movie. While the general run of such films 
is of a rather high quality, the themes and subject matter have become 
repetitive. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason why "Air America," (citywide) which stars Mel Gibson and 
Robert Downey and is about the CIA's secret airline operating in Laos in 1969, 
seems so invigorating at first. It's a great, untapped movie subject, and the 
director Roger Spottiswoode works up the material in high style. At its best 
it's a luxuriant black comedy. The buccaneer aviators who maneuver the 
experimental prop planes and huge, lumbering transports above the lush Laotian 
highlands are juiced by their own adrenalin. They're all a little high, and the 
movie itself has a slightly delirious, narcotized quality. 
</P>
<P>
The black comedy arises naturally out of the material. The CIA kept a secret 
mercenary anti-communist army in Laos for more than a decade, and Air America 
was its air support. As a covert, CIA-run, civilian-operated airline in charge 
of transporting everything from pigs to opium, Air America did not even 
officially exist. The pilots, recruited both from civilian life and from the 
military, were generally not told about the nature of their missions, or even 
that they were working for the CIA. (That doesn't mean they didn't know.) But, 
if the dangers were extraordinary -- more Air America pilots died in Laos than 
in Cambodia or Vietnam -- so were the financial rewards. Pilots got paid by the 
flight, and often there were dozens per day. 
</P>
<P>
The wacky disassociation of working for a non-existent airline in a 
non-existent war is what gives "Air America" its tone of funhouse grisliness. 
(The film opens with Nixon on TV telling the world there is no American 
presence in Laos.) These non-people don't even have the solace of having their 
heroism recognized. Their exploits, like their deaths, go officially 
unrecorded. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the film is racking up its absurdist points, it's a free-wheeling, 
sporty entertainment. The shots of huge porkers being parachuted to earth in 
crates, of Buddhist priests blessing the planes before lift-off, or the sight 
of a miniature golf course carved out of the jungle, have a special kind of 
comic charge. They reflect what really happened in Laos. The absurdity isn't 
tacked on to the story; it is the story. And there are moments when the 
nuttiness has a majestic sweep, as when a storm-tossed plane emerges from dark 
clouds and into the huge, looming face of a Buddhist shrine. 
</P>
<P>
As the film floats along, however, it remains essentially without focus. 
There's a conflict built into the script all right: Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson), a 
veteran of 15 years flying in Southeast Asia, tries to live down the guilt of 
transporting opium as a routine part of his job. Billy Covington (Robert 
Downey, Jr.), recruited from L.A. after botching his job as an eye-in-the-sky 
air traffic pilot, arrives in Laos with only the most naive assumptions about 
his job. When he discovers the extent of the corruption, he goes in for some 
free-style sabotage and, in the process, forces Gene into a moral reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
But the conflict is a case of too little too late and, in any event, it seems 
de-fanged. Robert Downey, Jr. gives a wonderfully open and engaging performance 
but, the way the film has been set up, his arrant innocence seems like a plot 
convenience. It's true that the Air Americans were kept in the dark about a 
great many things, but, with a mentor like Gene, who is so supremely cynical 
that he can't say anything to anyone without smirking, Billy seems not so much 
callow as dumb. 
</P>
<P>
"Air America" has a political consciousness: the battle sequences have gravity 
and the shots of the Laotian peasants are stunningly empathetic. The film 
exhibits a healthy "MASH"-like disrespect for the dangerous baloney of 
officialese. But the "48 HRS"-style buddy-buddy badinage and rough-housing 
between the aviators doesn't fill out the film's visual grandeur. It diminishes 
it. (So do the numerous what-the-hell anachronisms, like references to Mother 
Teresa and General Ky's liquor store in Orange County. In 1969!) 
</P>
<P>
Mel Gibson gives a cocky, assured performance -- a star performance. But he 
doesn't provide the kind of shadowings that might make Gene's guilt-ridden 
con-artistry resonate. Or maybe the shadings were edited out. There's so much 
voluminous detail and incident in "Air America" that at times the film 
resembles a vast swatch of footage; you get the feeling 10 other movies could 
have been made from what was shot. Some of the characters, like Burt Kwouk's 
deliciously corrupt General Lu Soong, are given ample display; others, like 
Nancy Travis' refugee camp coordinator, are barely in the movie, even though 
their roles seemed conceived on a much fuller scale. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible that the filmmakers got so high on the exhilarating possibilities 
in the material that they just let the cameras run, waiting for it to all come 
together in the editing room. "Air America" is far from a disgrace, but it's so 
rare to see a film with this much panoramic verve that you want it to deliver 
the real goods and not this cargo-load of tinkertoy war-is-heck ironies.

<P>
ELEGANT SHOW BY O'ROURKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are more than a few good musicians populating the Los Angeles jazz scene 
who, for this reason or that one, don't get the recognition they deserve. 
Pianist Brian O'Rourke should be taken off that list pronto. 
</P>
<P>
In an appearance with bassist Ernie McDaniel and drummer Kenny Dennis at 
Chadney's in Burbank Wednesday, O'Rourke delivered renditions of classic pop 
and jazz standards that were marked by abundant spirit, solid musicianship and 
a sense of teamwork among the participants. 
</P>
<P>
The youthful pianist, who has been heard with Jack Sheldon, Frank Sinatra Jr. 
and Gerald Wilson, employs a light touch and a quick-think technique, and he 
dances about the keyboard with an Astaire-like elegance, leaving shimmering 
melodies scattered like sequins in his wake. He uses a lot of body language as 
he improvises, cocking his head to his right when he gets into a cooking 
groove, pulling back from the keyboard -- as if to better examine what he's 
playing -- when he executes a lickety-split line, and bouncing his torso in 
tempo on the medium-paced tunes. It's obvious he enjoys his chosen line of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Parker's "Scrapple From the Apple" exemplified O'Rourke at his best. He 
delivered the melody with a contrapuntal bass line that, if you listened 
closely, was another melody, that of "Honeysuckle Rose," the tune from which 
three quarters of "Scrapple" is harmonically derived. His solo included a 
bluesiness reminiscent of Oscar Peterson, ringing parallel octaves of stunning 
facility and chordal passages that rapidly moved down, then up, then back down 
again, like a child devising a creative way to hop two-legged down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis and McDaniel were essential components to the success of the show that 
also included "I Thought About You" and "Take the 'A' Train." The bassist's big 
sound provided lush low-end support for O'Rourke's improvisations, and Dennis' 
crisp drum work added rhythmic encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
With more exposure as a leader, Brian O'Rourke, who plays tonight with Dennis' 
trio at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, could easily become one of the 
mainstays of L.A.'s jazz mainstream. ZAN STEWART

PERSONAL COOKING, ITALIAN-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is Fama? A year ago, I thought I knew. It seemed to be a slightly 
Frenchified idea of a Californianized version of an Italian restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
And evidently a good idea, because this most disorienting of rooms -- full of 
meticulously crafted blond-wood structures leaning at Expressionist angles -- 
was roaring. I mean, people were fighting to get in. (Well, it was roaring, 
too, with all those sound-reflective surfaces.) 
</P>
<P>
This had not been the original idea, though. Fama was planned as an Italian 
restaurant, but Sally Fama is Hans Rockenwagner's wife, and the public 
fervently expected impressive inventions of the sort they were used to at 
Rockenwagner restaurant. Fama found itself obliged to serve things like trout 
on saffron rice, scattered with giant capers and toasted almonds. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the wheeling cloud of restaurant first-nighters has moved on to 
newer placesand Fama has sneakily reverted to its original plan: a personal 
style of Italian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the appetizers, at any rate, do have an Italian or Italian/Californian 
aspect. The salad of sweet red and yellow tomatoes, sliced and dashed with 
vinaigrette, is a tastefully simple celebration of these particularly sweet 
tomatoes (vine-ripened, it says here very credibly). A "light style" eggplant 
Parmesan made by grilling eggplant slices and heating them in tomato sauce with 
some smoked mozzarella epitomizes the clever California-Italian style. 
</P>
<P>
One of the successes of the old menu is still available, the eggplant mousse 
surrounded by a pool of tomato sauce -- rather like fresh cream of tomato soup 
-- with a flotilla of green gnocchi bobbing around. It seems as un-Italian to 
me as it did last year, but it's still irresistible. The smoked trout salad, 
with rather mild fresh horseradish sauce, and salad garnished with goat cheese 
on toast are as California as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
Fama makes all, but all, of its pasta fresh. This means even spaghettini -- and 
very tasty spaghettini it is, though the fresh texture is a bit of a surprise, 
something like Oriental pan-fried noodles. It comes mixed with sliced grilled 
carrots, zucchini, onions, celery and sweet peppers, combining a lot of our 
favorite things. 
</P>
<P>
The other pastas cover an amazingly wide spectrum. The jalapeno rotellini are a 
shocking bright green color and taste a bit peppery, but the overall impression 
of this dish is of the rich cream sauce and the smokiness of the salmon mixed 
with it. Shocking in their own way are the noodles with homemade Milano 
sausage. They're in the old-fashioned hearty-Italian style, where tomato sauces 
taste like sweet tomato paste. 
</P>
<P>
The list of meat entrees is short, and the star is the exquisite, thin-sliced 
baby Bodega salmon, which has an unusual delicacy of flavor. They tend to what 
the West Side would call sober and traditional: lemony grilled ahi served with 
a sort of tomato hash on the side, filet mignon with a wonderful grilled flavor 
and an early-'80s green peppercorn cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Sober is good. The big innovation here is breast of capon with red lentils -- 
an intriguingly tangy puree of red lentils, actually. But the capon itself is 
chewy, practically rubbery. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are a little bit country, a little bit rock 'n' roll. The best is 
the two scoops of intense chocolate mousse in a small sea of pureed hazelnuts 
in cream. You can get fruit in a lively champagne zabaglione. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there's apple crisp and a soupy rice pudding much improved 
by the addition of fresh pecans. The surprise is Mummy's two-layer cheesecake, 
simply the old-fashioned sort with a sour-cream frosting layer, but 
well-balanced and very fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Fama is still loud and sort of disorienting. No matter (unless you really want 
to carry on conversation). It was good before and it feels more sure of itself 
this time around. 
</P>
<P>

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: MON KEE -- RECLAIMING OLD GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time in the late '70s and early '80s, when clams with black bean 
sauce were considered exotic, when only so-called "adventurous" eaters would 
order pan-fried squid, and when Mon Kee was the only good Chinese seafood 
restaurant in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the San Gabriel Valley has become the place to go for Chinese 
seafood, and Chinatown's Mon Kee might be only the 25th most interesting place 
to get live crab or shrimp with spicy salt. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'80s, Mon Kee tried opening a second restaurant in Beverly Hills 
called Mon Kee West. Where the original was a bare-bones dive, the new place 
was expensively ornate. The food got fancied up, too. Regulars of the old place 
complained -- the twice-cooked scallops weren't as delicious, the whole catfish 
wasn't as fresh-tasting -- and eventually Mon Kee West closed. (Other Mon 
Kee-owned Chinese seafood restaurants, called Mandarin Cove, have less serious 
intentions.) 
</P>
<P>
Now Mon Kee is testing the waters in Encino, testing them with steamed 
flounder, sizzling oysters, lobster with ginger and green onions. Mon Kee may 
not be the best Chinese seafood restaurant in Los Angeles anymore, but it's 
working hard to become the best Chinese seafood restaurant in the San Fernando 
Valley.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'FOURTH OF JULY' ARRIVES IN STORES WITH A BANG

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
One of the most praised, successful and controversial films of last year, "Born 
on the Fourth of July" (MCA/Universal, priced for rental, R), leads off this 
week's videocassettes with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the real-life experiences of Ron Kovic (though with some stretching of 
the facts), "Born on the Fourth of July" is the dramatic story of a soldier who 
volunteered to fight in Vietnam but returned paralyzed below his chest. 
Director Oliver Stone ("Platoon," "Wall Street") provides the lengthy but never 
boring film -- winner of two Academy Awards -- with his usual gritty view, and 
Tom Cruise surprised many detractors with his strong performance as Kovic. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent pictures new to video this week: 
</P>
<P>
"Revenge" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) came out earlier this year with a big star 
(Kevin Costner) and a hot director (Tony Scott of "Top Gun") but still only 
managed to gross about $16 million. The passionate-triangle thriller also stars 
Anthony Quinn, Madeleine Stowe and Sally Kirkland. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Steel" (MGM/UA, $89.98, R) stars Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie cop who 
gets involved with a crazy killer. The most publicized aspect of this 1990 
release was that it was directed by a woman (Kathryn Bigelow). 
</P>
<P>
"Coupe de Ville" (MCA/Universal, priced for rental, PG-13) -- not to be 
confused with the Robin Williams movie "Cadillac Man" or the Clint Eastwood 
vehicle "Pink Cadillac" -- stars Alan Arkin, Joseph Bologna and Patrick Dempsey 
in a comedy about three brothers who try to deliver a classic car to their mom 
for her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Torrents of Spring" (HBO, $89.99, PG-13) is a period drama starring Timothy 
Hutton and Nastassja Kinski, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockula" (Cannon, $89.95, PG-13) spoofs vampire films and rocks out with Bo 
Diddley, Thomas Dolby and Toni Basil. 
</P>
<P>
VINTAGE VIDEO: "Elvira's Midnight Madness" is the umbrella title given to 
Rhino's latest batch of schlocky horror films from the late '50s: 
"Frankenstein's Daughter," "She Demons" and (directed by bad-movie master 
Edward Wood, Jr.) "Night of the Ghouls." TERRY ATKINSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration said Thursday that Iraq has sent word that most 
Americans in Iraq and Kuwait cannot leave and may be held indefinitely, raising 
the specter of a painful new complication for the U.S. effort in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Pentagon confirmed that 50,000 more Iraqi troops are 
gathering in southern Iraq, apparently preparing to bolster forces in Kuwait, 
as newly arrived U.S. troops took up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia. The 
American forces are as close as seven miles to the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
As Iraq showed signs of digging in, the U.N. Security Council unanimously 
declared the annexation of Kuwait "null and void." It called on all countries 
and organizations to refuse to recognize Baghdad's claim on its tiny neighbor 
and demanded that Iraq "rescind its actions purporting to annex Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department officials said they are growing increasingly 
concerned about 580 Americans in Iraq and 3,000 more in occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"They are stuck," Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said of the 
marooned Americans. ". . . It's bad news that the airports are not open and 
borders are closed." 
</P>
<P>
Only a relative handful of U.S. diplomats and American citizens on short-term 
visitors' visas will be permitted to depart, according to officials, who said 
that one vehicle of departing embassy personnel was turned back at Iraq's 
border with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight Americans remain in Baghdad's Rashid Hotel, where they have been 
detained since Monday. A 10-year-old California girl, Penelope Nabokov, who was 
released from the hotel into the custody of the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday, 
remains at the embassy while U.S. officials try to arrange for her safe passage 
out of the country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The ominous notice that most foreigners will be held indefinitely and the 
appearance of fresh Iraqi troops along Kuwait's northern border came as U.S. 
intelligence officials watched Iraqi forces digging defensive positions on 
Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia. Pentagon officials said their actions 
suggest that an invasion of Saudi Arabia may not be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be in a defensive posture," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams 
said. "But nonetheless, Iraqi forces are still capable of an offensive action." 
</P>
<P>
As the Mideast crisis entered its second week, diplomats worked feverishly to 
find a way out of the standoff. Among other actions internationally: 
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders postponed until today a critical summit meeting in Cairo aimed at 
finding a peaceful resolution -- possibly an all-Arab force to act as a border 
buffer between the Saudis and Americans on one side, and the Iraqis on the 
other. Representatives of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein are among those slated 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials confirmed a "gathering" of Iraqi troops along Iraq's border 
with Turkey. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Ankara, told Turkish 
leaders they could depend on their North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in 
any showdown with its neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's trade and oil routes were virtually sealed off as British and French 
warships joined American ships gathered in the gulf to enforce sanctions 
against Iraq. In London, the government said it is sending a squadron of 
Tornado fighters to Saudi Arabia and a squadron of Jaguar fighters to the gulf 
region to help fend off any Iraqi attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union denounced Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, but said it would not 
take part in any multinational force against Baghdad outside the U.N. umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. vote denouncing the annexation, the third such action taken this week, 
was 15 to 0. In its third meeting since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, it 
demanded immediate and unconditional Iraqi troop withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow sovereign state members of the United Nations to be swallowed 
up," U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering emphasized that the U.S. presence in the area is strictly defensive, 
under provisions of the U.N. Charter, and intended to help protect Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, Finland was chosen Thursday as chairman of a Security Council 
committee set up to monitor U.N. economic sanctions and an arms embargo imposed 
on Iraq to force its withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of U.S. servicemen dug into positions inside Saudi Arabia 
and awaited the arrival of thousands more in the coming weeks. In the United 
States, the Army's 24th Infantry Mechanized Division based in Ft. Stewart, Ga. 
announced it was formally on alert and readied its tanks and troops to be sent 
to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon operations even extended to Tennessee and Wisconsin, where local 
Air National Guardsmen were hurriedly called from their civilian jobs and 
prepared to help fly U.S. troops and gear the 5,000 miles to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Two days into the operation the Pentagon has dubbed "Desert Shield," White 
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the costly overseas deployment would 
force the Pentagon to exempt military personnel accounts from potential budget 
cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction formula. 
</P>
<P>
While most lawmakers continued to support the deployment of U.S. forces, 
Congress' inability to forge a budget compromise with the White House has 
raised concerns that the federal government could face automatic spending cuts 
of as much as $100 billion by Oct. 1. At the same time, officials said that the 
potential costs of operating a large military force in the Persian Gulf 
indefinitely made it increasingly unlikely that such automatic cuts would be 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that the cost of Operation Desert Shield, even if not 
substantially escalated, could easily reach that of the United States' invasion 
of Panama and subsequent operations -- about $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
But while President Bush indicated concerns about the financial cost of the 
Saudi operation, he has indicated he has committed to drawing a line in the 
sand, protecting vital economic and strategic interests and Americans in the 
Middle East.

The fear for American lives in Kuwait and Iraqi clearly increased with 
unsettling news and events Thursday. Eight diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad were expected to travel to Jordan by road on Thursday. But when they 
arrived at the border, Iraqi officials prevented their crossing, although they 
called it just a "delay," Jordanian officials said. American officials say that 
the government of Saddam Hussein had earlier given permission for the partial 
evacuation of the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, the Iraqis say they are being allowed to leave, but they aren't 
being allowed to leave. Our only interest is in getting them out. The best way 
to do that is to keep our cool," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official said he was not prepared to call any of the 
Americans held in Iraq "hostages" because "there's no indication they have been 
taken with any particular purpose in mind. You are a hostage for something." 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand said the foreigners were being 
held as "prisoners," and said his government was very concerned about its 
estimated 450 citizens in Kuwait and Iraq. "They are being detained. They 
cannot leave either Kuwait or Iraq. So you can say they are prisoners," 
Mitterrand told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to us to help them," he added, saying he is ready to send a senior 
official to Baghdad to negotiate his countrymen's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
While the dangers for those citizens appeared to mount, Iraqi officials made 
ominous threats against U.S. military forces. Officials in Baghdad said the 
U.S. force, which is expected to mount beyond 50,000 men, could be used to 
invade Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that any such move "will be answered decisively," Iraq's ambassador to 
Greece suggested the Iraqis would unleash poison gas on any attacking American 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
As the intentions of Iraqi troops remained ambiguous, however, the Pentagon 
raced to build on U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, where British aircraft and 
support crews will soon join them. The next 2 to 3 days will be critical, said 
officials. With new troops departures slated for the coming days, the initially 
skimpy U.S. force will begin to grow to a size that would give Saddam Hussein 
second thoughts about attacking, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's much more to come" over the next several days and possibly weeks, said 
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. "This is an operation that is going to 
continue for several days -- one might say many days," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon, citing Saudi sensitivities, remained mum on how many forces 
are in Saudi Arabia and which U.S. troops are expected to arrive. Even so, that 
confusion may help to deter an Iraqi advance, said one Pentagon official.

DEUKMEJIAN SINGLES OUT HONIG IN COUNTERATTACK AGAINST CRITICS

Lashing out at an old political adversary, Gov. George Deukmejian accused state 
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig on Thursday of not keeping a promise to 
voters to use Proposition 98 money for significant reduction of class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian criticized Honig at length while responding to the school chief's 
outspoken criticism of the governor's veto of $480 million in education funds 
from the $55.7-billion state budget he signed last week. 
</P>
<P>
Honig has called Deukmejian's actions "spite cuts . . . made out of anger and 
vindictiveness" because educators pressured the Legislature into resisting the 
governor's attempts to suspend provisions of Proposition 98, which guarantees 
public schools at least 40% of the state General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein joined in the 
anti-Deukmejian chorus on Wednesday, charging that the governor's actions were 
"mean-spirited" and "punitive." She vowed, if elected governor, to restore $462 
million of the vetoed school funds. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's advisers have been worried about the rhetorical beatings he has 
been taking, not only concerning the school-fund vetoes but the entire budget 
negotiations last month. The Legislature went four weeks into the new fiscal 
year without passing a state budget, and the governor has been accused by 
Democrats and Republicans alike of lacking leadership early in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
The governor finally acceded to his advisers' urgings on Thursday and held a 
press conference to begin trying to tell his side of the budget story, 
especially regarding school money. "Rightly or wrongly, he's been hurt," 
conceded one longtime Deukmejian strategist. 
</P>
<P>
What the governor did in signing the budget was to reduce from 4.8% to 3% a 
cost-of-living increase voted by the Legislature for elementary and secondary 
schools. But he set aside $264 million of these vetoed funds to finance 
substantial reductions in class sizes for high school English, math, science 
and social studies courses. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is simply keep faith with the public and reduce class 
sizes," Deukmejian told reporters. "I'm trying to do something in terms of 
using this money in the classroom itself -- and not having virtually all of it 
go out in salaries for teachers and administrators. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He said that when Honig and the state's education Establishment sold voters on 
Proposition 98 two years ago, they argued that the money was needed, in part, 
for class-size reduction. Indeed, a ballot argument signed by Honig emphasized 
that California ranked "dead last on average class size." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Deukmejian contended that Honig last January asked the governor 
only for a 3% increase in school funds, the same as ultimately was approved. 
"Now, he's out making all kinds of intemperate statements," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
In a one-two punch aimed at the schools chief, state Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los 
Altos Hills) later Thursday showed the Senate Budget Committee some TV 
commercials sponsored by Proposition 98 supporters during the 1988 campaign. 
The commercials included references to the need for reductions in class size. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said voters approved the ballot measure "on the assumption and 
expectation" class sizes would be reduced, but "we've done nothing in the past 
two years to reduce class size." 
</P>
<P>
Honig, who also testified before the committee, said the Deukmejian-Morgan 
"argument that this measure was sold just on class size" was "pretty thin." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Morgan last year won passage of legislation to reduce class sizes in 
line with the way Deukmejian now advocates. But the reduction was to be 
financed with surplus state budget revenues, and this year there were none. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assembly Democrats on Thursday moved toward a showdown with 
Deukmejian on his education fund vetoes. They scheduled a floor vote for Monday 
on legislation that would restore the school cost-of-living increases back to 
4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
In his press conference, Deukmejian also said that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
and the resulting havoc in the international oil market again showed the need 
to plan "for environmentally safe" offshore drilling. President Bush has 
declared a moratorium on oil drilling off most of the California coast, a 
position supported strongly by both Feinstein and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the 
Republican gubernatorial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian argued that if the United States were free of the need for 
foreign oil, "the world would be a safer place because dictators like Saddam 
Hussein would no longer loom so large on the national stage."

FEINSTEIN AIRS AD ATTACKING WILSON ON THE S&amp;L ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The campaign for governor exploded into rancor Thursday when, in a risky 
strategic move, Dianne Feinstein launched television ads criticizing Republican 
Pete Wilson for accepting money from savings and loan executives -- and 
implying that Wilson's income resulted in votes that harmed taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged, Wilson likened Democrat Feinstein's tactics to red-baiting 
"McCarthyism" and demanded that the 30-second commercials be taken off the air. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that Feinstein will refuse to do so, Wilson announced plans to take to 
the airwaves shortly in self-defense -- perhaps beginning a wholesale political 
barrage months earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"However juicy the issue, she has got the wrong man," Wilson declared angrily 
at a late-afternoon press conference in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's move to try to tar Wilson with one of the season's most fiery 
issues -- the multibillion-dollar savings and loan conflagration -- came 
suddenly and surreptitiously. 
</P>
<P>
Without releasing the advertisements to reporters -- as her campaign had 
throughout the primary season -- Feinstein began airing the spots late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ads were released despite Feinstein's own past assertions that she has no 
evidence that Wilson intervened on behalf of the S&amp;Ls during his eight-year 
tenure in the Senate. Wilson, unlike Democrat Alan Cranston, has not been 
accused of acting on behalf of any scandal-ridden thrift. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Feinstein took the approach that Wilson's absence from 
the scandal is as much an indictment of his tenure in the Senate as 
intervention would have been. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Wilson's duty to the citizens of California was not to sit by and watch 
as the S&amp;L scandal unfolded," she said. "And his excuse that he did nothing 
isn't good enough. . . . The people want a public official to perform the 
duties they were elected to do and not use public office as a steppingstone to 
your next job." 
</P>
<P>
The ad implies a connection between Wilson's behavior and his receipt of 
$243,000 in contributions from the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson joined the Senate after the thrift industry was deregulated -- the 
policy decision blamed for much of the industry's collapse -- and in two major 
votes on a federal bailout, he voted against the industry's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has emerged as a potent one during this year's elections across the 
country, where it has been pitched like a grenade between Republicans and 
Democrats. The decline of dozens of thrifts across the nation has been splashed 
across newspapers and television screens, and the cost to taxpayers of bailing 
out failed institutions now is estimated at $500 billion. Voter surveys taken 
by political campaigns, including Feinstein's, have shown the electorate to be 
highly interested in fixing blame for the costs. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor was fund raising in Northern California Thursday 
and could not be reached for comment apart from the prepared statement. But her 
most recent remarks about Wilson's role with the S&amp;L crisis -- in which she 
said that she did not have any evidence of wrongdoing -- were seized upon by 
Wilson as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that I have intervened on behalf of anyone, because I 
haven't," Wilson said. "Mrs. Feinstein knows that and yet she persists. . . . 
The people of this state are entitled to have as governor someone whose 
personal ethics can withstand the pressures that apparently she has succumbed 
to. 
</P>
<P>
"This is simply innuendo of a kind that we used to call McCarthyism." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson suggested that by launching the advertisement now, Feinstein was hoping 
to manipulate public opinion polls and then use the polls to encourage 
donations to her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein's campaign manager denied any such intent and defended the use of 
the commercial. "I don't have any idea when those polls are starting up," Bill 
Carrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to run the commercials is risky for Feinstein, in part because it 
virtually depletes her campaign bank accounts. At the close of the last 
financial reporting period, Feinstein had about $650,000 on hand. The Wilson 
campaign estimates that she has since reserved in the neighborhood of $800,000 
in television time. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick would not disclose how close to the financial brink the campaign has 
come, but did acknowledge that the budget was tight. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be driving on fumes from here till Nov. 6," Carrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign manager indicated that the advertisement was released because 
Feinstein's forces fear that unless they become aggressive, they could cede 
momentum to Wilson. Wilson has been attempting to chip away at Feinstein since 
the primary with a series of commercials criticizing her record and recent 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a concern, which is basically that that tone of the campaign was set 
by the Wilson campaign," Carrick said. "The lessons of the 1988 presidential 
campaign are pretty clear. We're not going to sit back the month of August and 
do a Michael Dukakis imitation." 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis entered August of 1988 with a lead in the polls of as much as 17 
points, then watched it decline as George Bush went on the attack. The 
Democratic effort has since become something of an exemplar in how not to run a 
campaign.

567 HOSPITALS SUE STATE, ALLEGING SERIOUS MEDI-CAL UNDERPAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SAPPELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accusing the state of neglecting the needy, California's hospitals have joined 
together in a lawsuit against the state Department of Health Services to obtain 
bigger Medi-Cal payments and revive a health-care system that they say is 
edging toward collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented suit, announced Thursday, was brought on behalf of 
California's 567 hospitals, which contend that the state has illegally 
underpaid them millions of dollars to treat indigent outpatients under the 
Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the hospitals say, the financial strain has forced them to scale 
back or stop providing poor adults and their children with a variety of 
non-emergency procedures, including neonatal care, rehabilitative therapy and 
diagnostic medical exams. 
</P>
<P>
The hospitals also contend that the state's failure to shoulder a greater 
percentage of the costs for indigent care has endangered patients who are not 
poor by prompting the closure of trauma centers and emergency rooms throughout 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday, hospital representatives blamed the shortfalls 
on Gov. George Deukmejian's Administration, arguing that the governor 
traditionally has axed benefits for the disadvantaged to balance the state's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad day for hospitals that we have to sue the state to ensure adequate 
medical care for poor people in California. . . . Poor people should have 
access to the same kind of health care as the rest of us," said C. Daune 
Dauner, president of the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems, 
which filed the lawsuit in conjunction with Los Angeles' Orthopaedic Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a vice and it is being squeezed to a point where our very existence 
is being threatened," he said, adding that California hospitals are losing more 
than $575,000 a day treating Medi-Cal outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at our wit's end," agreed Steve Gamble, president of the Hospital 
Council of Southern California. "We don't want to sue the state (but) it has 
left us with no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Medi-Cal funding has emerged as a major issue in Sacramento 
and across the state as complaints have flooded in from nursing homes, doctors 
and AIDS activists, all of whom contend that the program is failing to meet the 
needs of its intended recipients. Patients dependent on Medi-Cal have begun 
crowding into public hospitals, straining resources from such programs as 
obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, hospital officials described their unusual lawsuit as "a last 
resort." The suit was the first filed in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling involving a similar situation in Virginia. The court ruled that the 
medical association there could sue the state. Although the governor's office 
had no immediate comment on the litigation, a Deukmejian spokeswoman said the 
governor has tried to justly distribute budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every special interest that didn't receive the amount they felt they were 
entitled to blames the governor," spokeswoman Anita MacKenzie said. "The budget 
has been balanced on the backs of each and everyone of them, according to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Department of Health Services said his agency is also 
withholding comment until it reviews the legal papers filed Wednesday in 
federal District Court in Los Angeles, which name the agency's director, 
Kenneth Kizer, as a plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman insisted that "California is doing the best it can, given the 
budget limitations that exist today and the growing number of indigent people 
who are availing themselves of Medi-Cal services. I suppose it is always going 
to be true that there is never going to be enough money." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the lawsuit is a contention by the hospitals that the state is 
violating federal Medicaid laws requiring reimbursement rates to be based on 
such "relevant factors" as the hospitals' costs of providing services and the 
quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the lawsuit contends, the state has primarily based its repayment 
policy on "budgetary constraints," ignoring other federally mandated factors. 
And for that reason, the lawsuit argues, the court should invalidate the 
current payment rates and compel the Department of Health Services to set new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"California has violated the law far too long," the hospital association's 
Dauner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 50 states, he said, California now ranks 47th in per-capita 
government spending for indigent patients. Since 1982, he said, the state has 
hiked overall payment rates to hospitals by only 2%, while hospital costs have 
soared 50% during the same period. He said hospitals today receive 55 cents on 
every dollar they spend for providing care under the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
David Langness of the Hospital Council of Southern California puts the blame 
squarely on Deukmejian. He said he recalls the governor remarking during his 
1986 budget message that "he believed we had a Cadillac of a medical program 
and he was going to scale it back to a Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically," Langness said, "he drove the Chevrolet into a wall and turned it 
into an old Ford Pinto."

MARKETS, UNIONS REACH 12TH-HOUR ACCORD, AVERT STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: REPRESENTATIVES OF SIX MAJOR STORE CHAINS AND 80,000 WORKERS APPROVE A 
TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighteen minutes after a take-it-or-leave-it deadline -- a delay that 
inadvertently caused hundreds of workers to walk off their jobs and begin 
picketing -- representatives of six major supermarket chains and 80,000 workers 
reached a tentative agreement Thursday night on a new three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which from the start appeared clearly afraid of being pushed 
into a strike, averted one by reaching last-minute compromises on wage, 
job-security and health issues. 
</P>
<P>
About 73,000 clerks and 7,000 meat cutters, who had been poised to strike at 7 
p.m. unless an agreement was reached, will begin voting on ratification 
Saturday, with results to be announced by the United Food and Commercial 
Workers early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the 10 union locals involved in negotiations said they will 
recommend ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Glee, modulated by fatigue, was restrained on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied," said John Sperry, president of 12,000-member UFCW Local 324 in 
Orange County. "I don't think anyone who ever goes through the negotiating 
process is ever happy." 
</P>
<P>
"I think both sides are equally satisfied," said David Willauer, a spokesman 
for the Food Employers Council, which represented 800 Ralphs, Vons, Alpha Beta, 
Stater Bros., Albertson's and Lucky markets from San Diego to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both sides declined to discuss details of the agreement until 
after ratification. 
</P>
<P>
However sources familiar with the negotiations said the markets agreed to raise 
their last offer of annual raises of about 3.5%. Clerks now earn from $4.25 to 
$13.05 an hour; meat cutters, $9.31 to $14.33. 
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that the markets agreed to some restrictions on their 
ability to purchase prepackaged meat. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement also included language aimed at protecting full-time jobs, a 
sensitive issue in an industry where the proportion of part-time workers is 
soaring. Markets say this has been necessary in order to adjust to peak hours 
as well as a consumer demand for 24-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
The union sought to introduce a clause that whenever a full-time employee quit 
or was fired, his slot would be preserved instead of being broken up into two 
part-time jobs. The exact wording used in the agreement was not available. 
</P>
<P>
Federal mediator Frank Allen said there were compromises on both sides. He said 
the talks were among the most difficult he has seen in two decades of 
monitoring food industry talks because "after some years of concessionary 
bargaining, unions are trying to capture some of the things they gave up during 
the lean years." 
</P>
<P>
Three times in the last two weeks the union had set a strike deadline. Each 
time, it was extended. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, union leaders arranged a "fail-safe" system in which pickets 
would be sent to the targeted chain -- Lucky, with 213 stores -- at 7 p.m. if 
no phone call of a settlement had been received. 
</P>
<P>
The markets' final offer was relayed to union leaders half an hour before the 
deadline. The presidents of the locals were still deciding how to respond -- 
their initial assessment was not unanimous, sources said -- when 7 p.m. came. 
By the time the local presidents decided to accept the offer, at 7:18 p.m., 
many members of four of the locals in Los Angeles and Orange Counties had begun 
to picket Lucky stores. Calls were quickly made to inform them of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Brooks, night manager of a Lucky store in the Marina Pacifica Mall in 
Long Beach, had spent his time up to the deadline teaching six potential new 
employees -- including a construction worker and a housewife -- how to use the 
cash register. He then described the difference between honeydew, crenshaw and 
casaba melons. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of the store called the wait nerve-racking as some shoppers rushed in 
to stock up just in case. When she heard of the agreement, clerk Hilda Ramirez 
sighed and said, "Thank goodness!" 
</P>
<P>
Clerks last struck in 1978, when they were out five days. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some unions, which maintain a "no contract, no work" tradition, the UFCW 
had indicated it was reluctant to strike. 
</P>
<P>
With a work force made more transient by the food industry's shift to a largely 
part-time force, the union did not have the type of membership likely to dig in 
for a long strike. Some analysts suggested it would take weeks to make a dent 
in the chains' business. Nor did the chains seem bothered by the prospect of 
permanently losing long-time customers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much customer loyalty in this business to start with," one expert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A broad array of issues -- many of them reflective of a supermarket industry 
that is trying to squeeze costs while offering broader services -- stood in the 
way of a settlement. They included: 
</P>
<P>
The union's demand for limits on the markets' use of non-union vending 
companies that not only sell products but stock displays.

FRANCE JOINS RANKS OF NATIONS BACKING SAUDIS; 
</P>
<P>

A FORCE THAT 'CAN INTERVENE.'

President Francois Mitterrand added France to the list of nations pledged to 
defend Saudi Arabia against an attack from Iraq on Thursday and sent additional 
warships and helicopters to the area as a force that "can intervene . . . 
against any aggression, any new aggression." 
</P>
<P>
"France hopes to see this problem solved by the Arab community, but if that 
proves impossible, France will assume her responsibilities," Mitterrand told a 
news conference after an emergency meeting with members of his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has ordered more French forces to the Persian Gulf "so that they can 
intervene at any time it becomes necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's action, taken after several days of apparent hesitation, places 
France squarely at the side of the United States and Britain, which had already 
promised to defend the Saudi kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
His decision is especially significant because France has been Iraq's largest 
supplier of Western arms during the past 10 years, as well as an occasional 
political ally. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand said he decided to act after it became clear that Iraq's armed 
forces, which seized Kuwait last week, now pose a serious threat to Saudi 
Arabia and other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Two French navy frigates are already in the gulf to help enforce a United 
Nations trade embargo against Iraq, with a destroyer on the way. But until 
Thursday the French had rebuffed suggestions that they take stronger measures. 
</P>
<P>
The new French forces in the gulf will include the helicopter carrier Jeanne 
d'Arc as well as one of the navy's two aircraft carriers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand said France is sending supplies and technicians to Saudi Arabia -- 
but no ground forces because "we have not been asked directly." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing a traditionally French distinction, he said that he is acting 
independently of the other Western powers, but still "associating her efforts 
with those of the other countries that are engaged." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand emphasized that France still hopes that action by the Arab League 
and the United Nations can solve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior French official said later that he doubts the Arab League can 
furnish a solution because the organization is too weak to force an Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
French analysts have mercilessly pointed out that their country has sold more 
than $5 billion worth of weaponry to Iraq over the past decade and that almost 
every major French politician has met cordially with Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitterrand, asked about his government's earlier friendship with Hussein, 
displayed no embarrassment. "You have forgotten that, at the time, there was a 
war between Iraq and Iran," he said. 
</P>
<P>
France has shown itself willing to play an independent military role in the 
Middle East before. In 1983, after Lebanese terrorists killed hundreds of U.S. 
and French troops with car bombs in Beirut, Mitterrand ordered an air strike 
against the terrorists' suspected headquarters -- an action the Reagan 
Administration refused to take. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the crisis over Kuwait is forcing France, as well as the United 
States, to define its military role in the world after the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's decision, and his emphasis on France's "responsibilities," 
indicates that he wants his government to be a major player in such events. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't have the idea that there is a single policeman in the world," 
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said in an interview, 
referring to the task the United States assumed during the 1950s and 1960s. 
"When the United States attempted to play that role, its costs were very high. 
. . . (But) there can be acts of aggression that the entire world condemns, as 
seems to be the case with Iran and Iraq."

ISRAEL TESTS NEW ANTI-MISSILE MISSILE; 
</P>

Israel on Thursday test-fired its new anti-missile missile, the Arrow, amid 
general apprehension about Iraqi charges that Israel is preparing to give the 
United States a hand in its military operation in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel faces "a threat to its security and 
well-being" and warned that any attacker "will bring upon himself a great 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
He said Israel has "no intention of attacking any of its neighbors, but it 
knows how to deal with anyone who tries to attack it." 
</P>
<P>
There was widespread speculation that the timing of the Arrow test was related 
directly to the threat from Iraq, but military officials insisted that the test 
had been planned for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis did not have to wait for the Arrow to know that Israel has answers 
to their threats toward Israel," Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, the chief military 
spokesman, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Arrow, funded in large part by the United States, is the first Western 
weapon designed to destroy enemy short-range ballistic missiles. It has a range 
of about 120 miles and moves at five times the speed of sound. Israeli military 
sources say they expect it to be in active service within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the test firing came as the Israeli press reacted strongly to 
charges broadcast late Wednesday by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that Israeli 
air force planes were being painted with U.S. markings for use against Iraqi 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers used red headlines -- reserved for the most urgent stories 
-- over the statement from Baghdad, which threatened immediate Iraqi 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The daily Yediot Aharonot screamed, "Fear in Israel: Conflagration in the Gulf 
Will Reach Us as Well." 
</P>
<P>
Hadashot, a popular tabloid, headlined its story: "The Ruler of Iraq Threatens: 
'We Will Attack Israel.' " 
</P>
<P>
A headline in Haaretz, perhaps the most-respected newspaper in Israel, said, 
"Iraq might initiate a missile attack against Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Radio and television stations offered instructions on how to put on a gas mask 
and what to do in the event of a chemical attack. Do not go into a basement, 
they warned, because poison gas is heavier than air and settles in low places. 
Cover the face with wet rags and wear protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
A Western embassy reportedly was considering asking its government whether to 
compile a list of nationals for a possible advisory to leave Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Shai, the Israeli military spokesman, denied categorically that Israeli 
aircraft are being readied for action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of editorial comment was that Baghdad's effort to implicate Israel 
in the deployment of U.S. troops and planes in Saudi Arabia suggested that 
Hussein was trying to justify in advance an attack on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Other military sources suggested that the Iraqi statement was designed to 
involve Israel in the gulf conflict so as to rally Arab nations against the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces are in a state of readiness, but no special 
precautions have been taken as regards the civilian population, except for the 
distribution of gas masks in Tel Aviv and in Galilee, a move that had been 
planned for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who led the Israeli armed forces in the 
Arab-Israeli War of 1967, declared: "We must not make light of the Iraqi 
announcement. The intention of this announcement is to acquit Iraq in the eyes 
of the Arabs and accuse the U.S. of collaboration with Israel." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi statement "is aimed at hurting the U.S. and diverting the 
argument to the old conflict with Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Gen. Rafael Eitan, who commanded the armed forces in the invasion of 
Lebanon, said, "There is no need for anxiety about what is happening in the 
Persian Gulf . . . and the way it has been related through the media."

ARE STRANDED AMERICANS IN FACT HOSTAGES?; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: EVEN BEFORE SADDAM HUSSEIN SLAMMED THE DOOR, WESTERNERS HAD LITTLE 
ASSURANCE THAT THEY COULD LEAVE.

<P>
Among Americans stranded in Baghdad, the word was spoken reluctantly, almost as 
a taboo: hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Once it became clear that the United States and Iraq were on a collision 
course, the word came automatically to their lips. Suddenly, to be visiting 
Iraq brought with it the threat of being taken hostage, a fate that had 
befallen dozens of other Americans in the chaotic Middle East over the past few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"That is always a consideration when you are in this region," said Lee Sender, 
a financial consultant from Washington. "As troops strengthened in the region, 
that idea ran through everyone's mind." 
</P>
<P>
"We got the feeling we were cards in a game, to be rounded up," added John 
Norman, a business consultant from North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The pair of businessmen were among a handful of Americans who passed through 
Jordan for other destinations after fleeing Iraq late Wednesday. They were the 
first Americans to take the overland route from Baghdad -- and for the moment 
may be the last. Iraq closed its borders to foreigners, including diplomats, 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Even before this news, Westerners in Iraq were living with little assurance 
that they could leave. The government of Iraq was saying little. Diplomatic 
consular officials offered only limited advice, mostly along the lines of "Get 
out when you can." Iraqi friends of travelers seemed of little use. 
</P>
<P>
"To get an exit visa, you had to do something with the Iraqi government. They 
were civil, but not very responsive," said Pat Schenning of Alexandria, Va., 
another of the Americans who fled. "The . . . potential of being taken hostage 
was there." 
</P>
<P>
Schenning, by coincidence, had obtained an exit permit last Wednesday from the 
Iraqi government, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. The others had gone to 
Baghdad on visas that did not require a special permit to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for everyone, there were questions of whether to try to leave and how. 
Originally, all wanted to leave by air to avoid the long desert journey to 
Jordan, but the airport was closed. There were conflicting reports on the 
opening of the border. The frontier with Turkey was said to be shut after 
Turkey announced that it would end operations of its oil pipeline from Iraq. 
The Jordanian border was alternately opened and closed. Rumors were the only 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage specter dominates American thinking in this crisis, but in other 
times and other places, foreigners have run the risk of being caught out of 
place when a conflict begins between their home country and temporary hosts. It 
has sometimes been the practice of governments at war to detain and intern 
foreigners. Even ethnic groups within a country that have links in some way 
with the enemy can suddenly become suspect; in the United States during World 
War II, Japanese-Americans were rounded up after Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 Americans are said to be in limbo in Baghdad, U.S. officials say, and 
another 3,000 are in Kuwait, which has been annexed by the Iraqi government of 
Saddam Hussein. Hundreds of Europeans are also stranded in both places. Tens of 
thousands of guest workers from Asia and the Middle East also work in Iraq and 
the rest of the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, for the group of Americans that arrived in Amman late Wednesday, 
the decision to leave was merely the end of a process of elimination. There 
were no other options. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly could not do any more business," quipped Frank Giral, an oil 
construction executive from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans did not flee earlier because the situation was still unclear. 
Long-distance telephones worked, and they could go out through drives about the 
city. The main indication of conflict was in the call-up of reserve soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, hints of trouble surfaced. Last Saturday, guests in hotels were 
herded together by nationality. "It was for security reasons," said Frank 
Zurawel, a soft-drink machinery technician from Long Island in New York state. 
The meaning of security was never explained, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the group reported seeing 11 American oil workers who had been bused 
from Kuwait to Baghdad and segregated at the Oberoi Rashid Hotel. Unarmed 
plainclothes guards kept watch on them, Zurawel, one of the witnesses, said. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, U.S. Embassy officials held daily briefings with the Americans but 
offered little concrete information. Finally, on Tuesday, embassy officials 
advised the Americans to leave if they could. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we were going to be on our own," said Norman, the North Carolina 
businessman. On Wednesday, the Americans rented cars and jeeps and headed to 
Jordan. The only hitch in their trip was a pair of flat tires that lengthened 
their journey by several hours. 
</P>
<P>
When they reached the border, procedures were normal. Passports were stamped 
and bags inspected. Once, an immigration official took a second look at some of 
the passports but eventually let everyone through. 
</P>
<P>
There was one final surprise, the Americans reported. Suddenly, in the midst of 
immigration procedures, soldiers started firing rifles into the air. It turned 
out that the high-spirited troops were greeting a holiday speech by Saddam 
Hussein with a volley of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I will turn these in for bonuses when we get home," Schenning said as 
he pulled a handful of shells from his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
On the Jordanian side, there was another problem. Little transportation was 
available, and a few Americans complained that the U.S. Embassy had not sent a 
bus or taxis. The group arrived in Amman on a bus that a private German company 
had sent to pick up 10 Germans who were also fleeing Baghdad.

LACK OF FEAR OVER WWIII LEADS TO RARE GLOBAL COOPERATION; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: THE IDEA OF COLLECTIVE ACTION IS A CONCEPT FROM THE PLAYGROUNDS: GANG 
UP ON HE WHO PICKS THE FIGHT, JUMP ON THE SEESAW TO OVERBALANCE THE BIG KID.

<TEXT>
<P>
The extraordinary worldwide response to the call for sanctions -- and even the 
use of arms -- against Iraq represents the fulfillment of an elusive dream of 
leaders past, Woodrow Wilson's recipe for achieving global security through the 
collective action of all nations. 
</P>
<P>
And the reason for the almost unprecedented commitment to joint action after 
the brutal invasion of Kuwait, scholars and government officials agree, lies in 
the new realities created by the ending of the Cold War -- especially the 
lifting of once-pervasive fears that even the most remote crisis could turn 
into conflict between the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this stuff is going on, and in all of the discussions, no one is 
raising the specter of World War III," said a senior U.S. official on the 
Administration's Kuwait crisis team who has served on many such teams in the 
past. "It's the first time I've been involved in a task force or a crisis 
(when) that hasn't been the first concern. Ten years ago, any crisis would have 
led within hours to speculation about Armageddon." 
</P>
<P>
Enshrined in the charter of the League of Nations, the idea of collective 
action is a concept from the playgrounds: Gang up on he who picks the fight, 
jump on the seesaw to overbalance the big kid. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in crisis after crisis, from Ethiopia to Iran, that goal has always given 
way to the reality of power, with nations unwilling or unable to join together 
against a single foe. Now, after 70 years of shattered hopes, collective 
security may be rising from the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
"There has never really been anything like it in this century," historian John 
Lewis Gaddis said of the alignment against Saddam Hussein. Added Stanley 
Hoffmann, a Harvard University expert on international affairs: "This is really 
quite remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
Scholars attempting to explain the unexpected cooperation say that the main 
reason for it lies in the new realities created by the end of the Cold War, an 
era whose onset leaves world powers with the luxury of joining in collective 
action without having to worry about guarding their own back doors. 
</P>
<P>
With the receding of the apocalypse having opened the way for new economic 
growth, they say that Hussein's sudden grab for oil strikes squarely at 
interests that are at the center of agendas for the future, from Washington to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Among other factors that combined to forge the common ground: the lack of 
ambiguity in the Iraqi attack upon Kuwait, collective guilt among powers who 
had failed to act before and new diplomatic ties that knit disparate responses 
into one. 
</P>
<P>
Whether such consensus can hold in driving the Iraqis from Kuwait remains an 
untested prospect. Uncertain, too, is whether such cooperation would form anew 
at a different time against a different foe. 
</P>
<P>
But scholars, for whom crises shed light on what would otherwise remain 
obscured, say that they are watching to see whether the unfolding events in the 
Middle East will prove the case for the kind of great-power teamwork for which 
some had all but abandoned hope. 
</P>
<P>
And with economic integration now intertwining the fates of nations and war 
between large powers regarded as less likely than ever before, some experts 
express a cautious optimism that the experiment might mark the beginning of a 
new age. 
</P>
<P>
"If this turns out well," says Richard N. Gardner, a Columbia University 
professor and former ambassador to Italy, "this would constitute a landmark 
event in the history of this century." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the anti-Iraqi forces now massing in Saudi Arabia remain largely 
those of the United States, augmented so far by only British support. It is an 
American operation, not endorsed by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
That lopsided alignment is far from the mandatory gang-up that Wilson and heads 
of other states had designed in the 1919 League of Nations Covenant as a 
guarantee against a repeat of World War I. It also falls short of what was 
envisioned in the U.N. Charter, which provides for a special multinational 
military force to act against aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first time in history, even the Soviet Union expressed interest 
Thursday in joining in a potential United Nations blockade. 
</P>
<P>
And in economic terms, a more fundamental breakthrough has already taken place. 
When the U.N. Security Council voted early this week to impose mandatory 
sanctions on Iraq and conquered Kuwait, it marked the harshest punishment the 
body had ever administered to one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
That sweeping net of sanctions already "transcends" previous experience under 
the League and the United Nations, said private economist David D. Hale. "We 
are really at the threshold of new cooperation here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The history of collective security is littered with examples of failure. When 
Mussolini grabbed for land in Ethiopia in a 1936 annexation bid, the League 
slapped on only mild sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that Germany had seemed intent on a war of its own. Rather than 
risk an affront to Mussolini, France and smaller members of the international 
organization essentially sacrificed the League. After an unchecked Italy won 
its triumph, the League voted to solicit suggestions about "improving the 
application of the Covenant." 
</P>
<P>
The post-World War II solution sought to tackle the problem in a different way. 
In the new United Nations, a committee of great powers would hold the reins 
acting as what Roosevelt called Four Policemen to punish states that violated 
the rules. According to Roosevelt's thinking, the military forces of the United 
States, the Soviet Union, China and Great Britain would serve as a peacekeeping 
force wherever they were needed in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But that Security Council arrangement quickly shattered as the Cold War broke 
out, guaranteeing repeated vetoes that left collective security without teeth. 
Only by virtue of Soviet absence did the United Nations respond as planned -- 
and then only once -- when a U.N. force responded to the invasion of South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, notes Columbia University's Gardner, an expert on international 
organizations, U.N. military involvement essentially has been limited to 
"blue-helmeted peacekeeping forces" made up soldiers from small nations. 
</P>
<P>
And even in response to state-supported hostage-taking in Iran, the Security 
Council -- while issuing a unanimous condemnation -- was unable to impose 
sanctions, blocked in the waning days of the Cold War by Soviet refusal to join 
with the United States against any potential foe. 
</P>
<P>
It is such balance-of-power calculations that some historians suggest have 
faded with the Cold War, opening the way to the kind of superpower cooperation 
evident in the crisis of the last eight days. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with the Soviet Union, Japan, China and the European Community in 
accord with the United States, some analysts suggest that -- at least in 
certain cases -- there at last may be a committee of great powers willing to 
act together. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening today is exactly what Roosevelt envisioned when he talked 
about the Four Policemen taking charge of the world," says historian Gaddis. 
</P>
<P>
What may knit those powers more closely together now than ever before are 
economic ties that make even China subject to what happens in the developed 
world. At the same time, Harvard's Hoffmann notes, leaders of the Soviet Union 
seem "determined to prove that they are the best citizens of the new 
international order." 
</P>
<P>
But scholars caution that other factors may make the Iraqi case the exception 
rather than the rule, with by far the most important the hammerlock on economic 
growth that Hussein could impose upon the developed world because of his 
control of a large part of the world's oil. 
</P>
<P>
They further point out that the world response to crisis undoubtedly has been 
accelerated by U.S. leadership made more efficient by the diplomatic ties 
forged in the past 18 months by President Bush.

Featherweight drones, one of the newest weapons in the nation's arsenal, are 
among the sophisticated weapons technology being shipped to the Middle East for 
possible use in aerial surveillance of opposing forces, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-pound planes -- dubbed unmanned aerial vehicles -- were requested by 
the recently deployed 82nd Airborne Division and are scheduled to depart with 
the "second wave" headed to Saudi Arabia, sources said. Five of the toy-like 
planes could leave as early as Thursday, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The planes, which can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously, have only 
been in use for the past five months and are still considered experimental. The 
82nd Airborne, stationed in Ft. Bragg, N.C., has flown them since June 15 in an 
effort to ferret out the movements of "enemies" in exercises. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked for us to go through a few more technical upgrades to give 
the system more flexibility and capability," said Marine Corps Col. Larry Karch 
of the Joint Project for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, an armed forces program 
funded by the Defense Department, which oversees the planes. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them some equipment for them to experiment with and tell us if we were 
on the right track. We never figured on this." 
</P>
<P>
Touted as an "eye in the sky," the plane allows its operators a 360-degree view 
from about 500 feet in the air. Since it can fly no farther than three miles 
from its operators, the vehicle is best suited to supply information to 
smaller-sized units, such as battalions and companies, Karch said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like making a 500-foot-tall man with a pair of binoculars. If he has his 
eyes up there, he can look over the hill and around the curve -- obviously, he 
has a great advantage," said program spokesman Ray Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
According to an Aug. 2 action report evaluating the 82nd Airborne's use of the 
system, called a Pointer by its Simi Valley-based manufacturer, AeroVironment, 
"its performance was outstanding." The division's commanding general, Maj. Gen. 
James H. Johnson, said that "if we go to war today, the Pointer will go with 
the division," according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Though the program has received glowing reports recently, it has also had its 
share of mishaps, according to a March 29 memo obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In the first launch last spring during tests in South Korea, the drone flew 
into a tree and was demolished. The second launch was successful, but ground 
controllers lost contact with the plane and it landed in a rice paddy, where a 
Korean farmer tried to claim it as his. A third drone ran into a general's 
helicopter in a test two days later. 
</P>
<P>
The planes, made of a lightweight non-metallic composite material, are launched 
by tossing them in the air javelin-style. With a 9-foot wingspan, the aircraft 
can fly using lithium batteries and an electric motor for about an hour.

AMERICANS SUPPORTIVE BUT JITTERY OVER U.S. ROLE 
</P>

Americans view the prospect of U.S. military engagement in the Middle East with 
a mix of skepticism, frustration, confusion and outright fear, according to 
interviews and a national survey by the Washington Post and ABC News. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this anxiety, there is broad initial support across the country for the 
decision by President Bush to dispatch troops to the region. The Post-ABC poll 
found that nearly three out of four people questioned said they approved of 
sending troops to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But the survey and individual interviews indicate that the support was often 
offered warily. 
</P>
<P>
For many of those questioned, the first instinct was not to rally 'round the 
flag, but to ponder why America had reacquired its thirst for Persian Gulf oil 
so quickly after the oil shocks of the 1970s; to brood over why more countries 
haven't leaped to the defense of Saudi Arabia, and to draw edgy analogies to 
the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm incredibly nervous -- I just don't have a good, confident feeling about 
this," said Barbara Humphrey, a planner for the city of Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The events of the past few days, she said, reminded her of the 1962 Cuban 
Missile crisis. "I remember going to sleep that night sure I was going to wake 
up to the sound of air raids -- this has a little bit of that same air of 
unreality." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey encapsulated the ambivalence toward the crisis felt by many: "How can 
you compare a life to the flow of oil? On the other hand, if the flow of oil 
were to stop, it might cost even more lives down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Her sentiments mirror the nation's anxiety about the course Bush has charted in 
the Middle East -- a path that six out of 10 persons interviewed in the 
Post-ABC News survey predicted would lead to war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 769 people questioned Wednesday said they would support going to 
war with Iraq to force its army out of Kuwait. But public support is far from 
overwhelming; four out of 10 said the United States "should not get involved in 
a land war in the Middle East even if Iraq's invasion means that Iraq 
permanently controls Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that a majority opposes an invasion of Iraq. Most of 
those questioned also opposed a preemptive strike by U.S. forces. And a 
majority opposed air strikes against military bases within the country. 
</P>
<P>
For most Americans, the Iraq crisis could not have happened at a worse time. 
With the national economy struggling, many now fear that increases in the price 
of oil could push the country into recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Post-ABC Poll found that 86% of those questioned expected the crisis to 
have a negative impact on the economy, with 39% predicting that it would have a 
"major negative impact."

MOSCOW PLEDGES NOT TO USE FORCE TO DISARM ARMENIAN MILITANTS

The Kremlin has pledged not to use force against thousands of armed militants 
in Armenia and instead will let authorities in the southern Soviet republic try 
to disarm those paramilitary groups, the new president of Armenia said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan also 
said it is time to "expand state sovereignty" of his republic, and that he is 
ready to negotiate with neighboring Azerbaijan over the bitter dispute 
involving control of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan, who was sworn in as Armenia's president last weekend, is in 
Moscow to discuss Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's July 25 decree 
ordering armed groups in Armenia to disband within 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
He said had "positive" talks on Wednesday with Prime Minister Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov, Soviet Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin and KGB chief Vladimir A. 
Kryuchkov. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, trying to quell violence in this ethnically diverse nation, had 
threatened to send in army and Interior Ministry troops to forcibly disarm the 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
Many militants, especially those in the volunteer Armenian Nationalist Army, 
the largest paramilitary group, have refused to comply. Armenia's Parliament, 
which this week is considering a declaration of independence, rejected 
Gorbachev's decree as interference. 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan said Thursday that he has been given assurances by senior 
officials, including Interior Minister Bakatin, that the deadline for handing 
over weapons would be extended. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an agreement that we will be able to carry out the decree freely with 
our own forces without intervention from outside," the Armenian leader said. 
"We have a strict agreement. They will not send in any troops. 
</P>
<P>
"As regards the deadlines, we talked about the fact that I am a new leader of 
the republic and I cannot be held responsible for the sins of the previous 
leadership," Ter-Petrosyan told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Armenia's Parliament was in control of the Armenian 
Nationalist Army. But it was unclear whether the republic's new leadership 
wields much influence over the paramilitary group. 
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan, whose statements marked an easing of tension between Armenia and 
the Kremlin, stressed that the main goal for Armenia is "to expand state 
sovereignty and radically democratize social life." 
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that it is possible for Armenia to have good relations 
with its traditional enemies -- the Muslim Azerbaijanis, Turks and Iran -- and 
that he is ready to open talks with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly 
Armenian enclave that is part of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic battles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over who should control the 
mountainous region have killed more than 200 people in the past two years.

An internal crisis erupted in the Nicaraguan military when the Sandinista 
Popular Army announced that air force chief Col. Javier Pichardo was fired, 
reportedly for revealing military secrets to Cristiana Chamorro, director of 
the pro-government newspaper La Prensa and daughter of President Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro. The statement said armed forces commander Humberto Ortega 
had replaced him with Col. Manuel Salvatierra.

The images on the television screen were awesome: a nuclear-powered aircraft 
carrier knifing through the Red Sea; bombers, tankers and missiles en route to 
the Persian Gulf; troops and warplanes headed to Ahdi Alroumi's part of the 
world -- a world in upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Watching with Alroumi were his Kuwaiti friends, college students gathered to 
get the latest news in his West Los Angeles apartment. This has become routine 
for them since Iraq invaded their country last week. 
</P>
<P>
They haven't wanted to do much else. Many have dropped out of summer school. 
They can't concentrate. They can hardly sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"We are praying five times a day," said Alroumi, 30, a student at Northrup 
University in Inglewood who is working on a master's degree in technology 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Kuwaiti students in California -- an estimated 2,000 -- Alroumi, who 
has been in the United States for six years, is here on a scholarship. He had 
been getting a monthly stipend from the Kuwaiti government. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the invasion, we have been glued to television news, reading reports in 
the newspaper and staying at home," he said. "We don't even go out for food, 
because we don't want to miss anything . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He recently acquired a fax machine to get late-breaking news about the Mideast 
and information from friends in the United States and Europe about relatives 
and friends in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Like his Kuwaiti college friends, Alroumi hungers for news about his family. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine called my family last Friday, and my family told him they 
were all OK," he said. "But since then, I have not heard one word from them. I 
have 10 brothers, one sister and my mother back there. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all a shock. I'm trying to keep myself calm. If I lived alone right 
now, I think I'd be dead from worry. I'm leaning on my friends . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
His network includes Abdullah Ali, 25, Ahmed al Khaled, 24, and Osamah al 
Tuwairesh, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Ali, a junior at Cal State Northridge studying mechanical engineering who has 
been here almost four years, said: "My sister called me on the afternoon of the 
invasion. They were scared to death. She said it felt like the house was going 
to fall down. I haven't heard from them since. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream always was to come to the United States and get my degree from here 
and go back and help develop my country. I will always keep that plan. . . . I 
will never give up on my country." 
</P>
<P>
Neither will Khaled, a senior at Cal State Long Beach, who has been in Southern 
California for six years studying computer engineering. He has two brothers and 
parents in Kuwait. A newlywed brother was heading from Australia to home when 
the invasion occurred; he is in Bahrain. The two have been in touch, but 
neither has heard from or about their family. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled said: "Knowing my parents, they will be stubborn and stay in Kuwait and 
try their best to resist. . . . I'm sure a lot of Kuwaiti families would rather 
die than leave. They want to stay and do everything they can to keep their 
country. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Khaled said that he and his Los Angeles friends want to return "no matter what, 
and give something back to Kuwait, because everything we had, knew and needed 
is in Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, they will stay in touch with their embassy in 
Washington and the Washington-based Committee to Free Kuwait, which is trying 
to help Kuwaiti students, residents and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have hope," Tuwairesh said. "My faith is in God. . . . I want Kuwait 
back, all of it, every inch."

<P>
Closing a swift tour of four Latin countries, Vice President Dan Quayle arrived 
in impoverished Haiti on Thursday with a plea and a blunt warning that unless 
its military allows free elections in November, it faces more cuts in foreign 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
Using unusually tough language for a diplomatic setting, Quayle told a meeting 
of Haitian military officers in the Presidential Palace: 
</P>
<P>
"We take note of the assurances of the Haitian army that they will not allow a 
coup and that they will not allow the democratic process to be impeded. So my 
message is: No coup. No murders. No threats. And, instead, free and fair 
elections that will bring honor to the brave people of Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, speaking with reporters on his plane en route from Bolivia, the vice 
president, discussing the Haitian elections, said, "If you are going to have a 
country that is not democratic and is not respectful of human rights, they are 
not going to be recipients of the American taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
American economic aid of $100 million a year was cut drastically in 1987 when 
the armed forces, still linked to the despised dictatorships of Presidents 
Francois Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, turned elections into a violent and 
bloody sham by allowing thugs to massacre more than 30 civilians trying to 
vote. Since then, U.S. aid has risen to $60 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
New elections have been set for Nov. 4, and Quayle, in his meetings with Gen. 
Herard Abraham, commander-in-chief of the Haitian armed forces, and his top 
officers, clearly wanted to ensure that these elections are allowed to proceed 
democratically. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Gen. Abraham is committed to having secure elections," Quayle told 
reporters. "The question is whether he can implement this." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was important that outsiders like himself come to Haiti before the 
elections to impress upon the military the importance of free elections. He 
mentioned former President Jimmy Carter and President Carlos Andres Perez of 
Venezuela as others who have come to Haiti on similar missions. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Haiti, despite the overthrow of the younger Duvalier in February, 
1986, stands with Cuba as the only holdouts against democracy in the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Bush Administration, which has offered Haiti $3 million to organize 
free and secure elections, wants the United Nations to send observers to the 
Haiti elections. He discussed this Tuesday, he said, with Perez and President 
Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, but he ran into a snag. 
</P>
<P>
While the Bush Administration wants the United Nations to act swiftly through 
the Security Council, Perez and Gaviria want action to be taken by the U.N. 
General Assembly, which, unlike the Security Council, is dominated by Third 
World countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a plausible argument," Quayle said, "but time is of the essence." He said 
he fears that the General Assembly would act too slowly on observers for Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle seemed generally optimistic about the chances for fair elections in 
Haiti, but he told reporters: "I'm not going to disabuse you of the fact that 
there are some very bad people in Haiti. It's a very divided country."

U.S. CHALLENGES MAJORITY-VOTE RULE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS GEORGIA'S REQUIREMENT IS ILLEGAL. PRACTICE 
HAS 'CHILLING EFFECT' ON BLACKS IN ELECTORAL PROCESS, SUIT ALLEGES.

<P>
In a major civil rights action, the Justice Department on Thursday sued to 
overturn Georgia's requirement that a candidate for public office must win a 
majority in primary and general elections or face a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The practice has had "a demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks 
to become candidates for public office," said John R. Dunne, assistant attorney 
general for civil rights. The state's majority-vote requirement, similar to 
that of eight other Southern states, is "an electoral steroid for white 
candidates," he added. 
</P>
<P>
California, like 40 other states, has a plurality requirement for primary and 
general elections, in which the candidate who gathers the most votes is 
nominated or elected. 
</P>
<P>
The government in its suit plans to cite elections in more than 20 Georgia 
counties where at least 35 black candidates won the most votes in their initial 
primaries, but then lost in runoffs as voters coalesced around a white 
opponent. The suit was filed in federal court in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Some political scientists who specialize in Southern voting patterns said that 
the elimination of the rule will help Republicans, because black candidates 
will more frequently land the Democrat Party's primary nomination, thus pushing 
conservative whites toward Republicans in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest the Republican Justice Department in the name of minority 
rights is pursuing policies that will help Republicans," said Larry Sabato, a 
University of Virginia political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
But Dunne said there was no consideration or discussion of possible political 
fallout from the suit. He said he made a pro forma mention of the suit to Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh and that he knew of no discussions of the action with the 
White House. He added that he would be surprised if there had been. 
</P>
<P>
Rob McDuff, a project attorney with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, 
praised the suit -- the first statewide challenge by the Justice Department to 
a majority-vote requirement -- as "a really good sign. It shows that the 
Justice Department, unlike under the (Ronald) Reagan Administration, is going 
to be vigorous in challenging discrimination in voting." 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the majority-vote requirement violates the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 and the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution "because it 
was adopted and has been maintained for racially discriminatory purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Dunne, discussing the suit with reporters, said the Georgia law was adopted in 
1964 "for the purpose of impairing the voting strength of minorities." He said 
the sponsor of the legislation, former Georgia House leader Denmark Groover, 
had acknowledged in a sworn statement that the purpose was to dilute the power 
of blacks voting as a bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks, while constituting 26.5% of Georgia's population and 24% of its 
voting-age population, make up less than 10% of elected officials in the state, 
Dunne noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Voting in the state of Georgia is racially polarized," the Justice Department 
said in the suit. "White voters rarely vote for black candidates or candidates 
identified with black interests, while these candidates generally receive 
significant support from black voters." 
</P>
<P>
"The majority-vote requirement in the context of racially polarized voting has 
had racially discriminatory results on black candidates in Georgia, since white 
citizens constitute a majority of the voters in most electoral contests," the 
government alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Bills were introduced in the Georgia Legislature in 1986 and 1989 to replace 
the majority-vote requirement with a plurality for nomination or election. But 
neither was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
"Georgia has refused to abandon the majority-vote requirement, even though 
state officials have known, or should have known, that the majority-vote 
requirement has denied and continues to deny black voters an equal opportunity 
to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice," 
the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Dunne said the Justice Department came upon the evidence that led to the suit 
last April when it refused to clear under the Voting Rights Act Georgia's 
system for electing superior court judges. In that matter, Dunne said that 
black voting strength was diluted by Georgia's use of at-large circuit 
elections that required a majority vote for victory. 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union for Georgia state Rep. 
Tyrone Brooks seeks to throw out the majority-vote requirement in every county 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department suit named as defendants Gov. Joe Frank Harris, the 
state board of elections, Secretary of State Max Cleland and various officials 
of DeKalb County. The county officials were cited as a class representing 
similar officials in counties where the government alleges that the majority 
requirement acts to dilute the voting strength of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The eight other states with majority vote requirements are South Carolina, 
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas. North 
Carolina recently shifted to a 40% plurality requirement.

CAUSE OF HUBBLE TELESCOPE DEFECT REPORTEDLY FOUND 
</P>

The defect that blurred the Hubble space telescope's view of the heavens 
apparently was caused by a flaw in an instrument used to measure the 
observatory's mirror as it was being built, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of tests conducted on a testing device called a "null 
corrector" found one spacing in the instrument was about one millimeter off 
from specifications, which would account for the deficiency, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly the smoking rifle," said National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration project scientist Edward Weiler. "There may be a few peashooters 
around. But this is the rifle." 
</P>
<P>
The null corrector was used to measure the surface of the telescope's primary 
mirror in 1981 when it was being ground in Danbury, Conn., by what was then 
Perkin-Elmer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were uncertain how the error in the null corrector occurred and 
withheld any final conclusion until the possibility of additional problems is 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Although upset that such an error occurred, Weiler said he was pleased that the 
probable cause of the telescope's defect had been found because it will enable 
engineers to be more certain that repairs being planned will correct the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers are developing a "prescription" for mirrors that will be built into a 
replacement camera officials hope to install in the telescope in 1993 to 
restore the telescope to full capability. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited, highly publicized $1.5-billion telescope was expected to 
revolutionize astronomy by peering more deeply and with greater clarity into 
space than ever before from its perch high above Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
But, after the 12-ton instrument was ferried into space in April, engineers 
discovered that the telescope's supposedly perfect optical system was seriously 
flawed because its 94-inch primary mirror suffered from spherical aberration, 
meaning its curvature is slightly incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
One millimeter is about 1/25 of an inch, or about the diameter of the point of 
a ball-point pen. 
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary analysis indicates that a discrepancy of this magnitude could 
cause spherical aberration similar to that observed in the (telescope's) 
primary mirror," a NASA statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The observatory can still conduct valuable research, but the flaw sharply 
reduced the telescope's abilities by preventing the device from bringing 
starlight to a sharp focus.

COLUMBIA BEING READIED FOR LIFTOFF IN UNPRECEDENTED SHUTTLE SHUFFLE

The repaired space shuttle Columbia inched past its grounded sistership 
Atlantis and was returned to the launching pad Thursday for liftoff around 
Sept. 1 on a critical flight to end NASA's long summer that saw no shuttle 
launchings. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented shuttle shuffle, Atlantis, crippled by a fuel leak, was 
rolled off launching pad 39A late Wednesday to make way for Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The two vessels passed each other shortly before dawn Thursday, with Columbia 
completing its 3.5-mile trip to the seaside firing stand around noon. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Columbia, carrying five astronauts, two civilian astronomers 
and a cargo of telescopes, will blast off around Sept. 1 on a 10-day astronomy 
mission that was grounded on May 30 by a hydrogen leak. The ship has since been 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
If the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's revised launching 
schedule holds up, only seven shuttle missions at most -- possibly as few as 
six -- will be launched this year. The space agency originally hoped to launch 
as many as 10 flights in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
One flight was lost because of problems readying the shuttle Discovery for 
launching earlier this year to carry the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in 
April, and fuel leaks with Columbia and Atlantis have prevented any flights 
since then.

for repair work at Florida's Kennedy Space Center. Only six or seven missions 
will be launched this year; NASA had hoped to send as many as 10 flights aloft 
in 1990. Associated Press

REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OBSTRUCTED AGENT ORANGE STUDY, PANEL CLAIMS

A House committee concluded Thursday that White House officials in the Ronald 
Reagan Administration "controlled and obstructed" a federal study of Agent 
Orange exposure among Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional panel said that a secret White House strategy to deny federal 
liability in toxic exposure cases led to the cancellation of the Centers for 
Disease Control study in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the House Government Operations Committee bolsters arguments of 
two veterans' groups, the American Legion and the Vietnam Veterans of America, 
which filed a lawsuit last week seeking to have the CDC resume its study of the 
health effects of Agent Orange exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House compromised the independence of the CDC and undermined the 
study by controlling crucial decisions and guiding the course of research, at 
the same time it had secretly taken a legal position to resist demands to 
compensate victims of Agent Orange exposure . . . " the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during the Vietnam 
War. It has been blamed by veterans' groups for 19 cancers and other health 
problems, including birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Congress ordered the CDC study to determine which Vietnam veterans had been 
exposed to Agent Orange. It was to be used as a basis for other studies. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said the study should not have been canceled "because CDC did not 
document that exposure could not be assessed" and disregarded other methods of 
measuring exposure.

DOG ENDS 3-CITY CHASE;

<P>
A bank robbery suspect led police on a wild chase through three cities Thursday 
before abandoning his wrecked car and fleeing on foot, only to cornered by a 
snarling police dog. 
</P>
<P>
During the ordeal, at least four cars were damaged, a curious 10-year-old girl 
was slightly injured by a door on a police car and a bystander was detained 
because he matched the description of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began shortly after 2 p.m. when a man walked into the Security 
Pacific Bank branch at 2516 E. Chapman Ave. and robbed a teller while 
simulating possession of a weapon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber fled in a white Chevrolet Camaro driven by a second man, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Fullerton Police Officer Steve Williams spotted the 
getaway car traveling west on the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, along with detectives from Anaheim, pulled the suspects over when 
they left the freeway at Brookhurst Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Camaro was ordered out of the car and arrested at gunpoint, 
but the passenger managed to slip behind the wheel and drive off, Fullerton 
Police Sgt. Ken Kepner said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who was later identified as Kenneth Lewis Crader, 27, of Buena 
Park, sped west on La Palma Avenue, police said. As the suspect's car 
approached busy Beach Boulevard near Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, it 
collided with another car. Two people were taken to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange with unspecified injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The crash, however, did not stop Crader, who sped away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later, a patrol car chasing Crader was struck broadside by 
another car at the intersection of Dale Street and Crescent Avenue in Anaheim, 
police said. The officer was unharmed, but his car was totaled, police said. 
The driver of the other vehicle was taken to a local hospital with minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, near the corner of Polk and Grand avenues in Anaheim, Crader decided 
to ditch the badly damaged Camaro and flee on foot, police said. Crader hopped 
fences and ran through back yards as police cordoned off the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A Cypress police dog was brought in to help search for the suspect. Within a 
few minutes, the dog found Crader in a tool shed behind a house on the 3100 
block of Tyler Avenue. Crader surrendered after the dog bit him on his right 
arm, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The convergence of police from four departments on the quiet neighborhood drew 
several dozen onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-old Karina Barajas said she was riding her bicycle barefoot on the 
sidewalk on the north side of Tyler Avenue when a squad car pulled up and she 
went over to investigate the commotion. Just then, an officer opened the 
passenger door, smashing the youngster's right foot and nearly causing her to 
topple off her bike. 
</P>
<P>
"She came home and was crying, and we thought she had seen something terrible 
when we realized it was her foot," said her 23-year-old sister, Barbara 
Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to Karina's puffy, red foot, Montoya said, "The worst thing was, he 
(the officer) just told her she should be more careful next time." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Muller, a 35-year-old a mail clerk, said he was walking away from the 
uproar to his apartment on Grand Avenue when a plainclothes detective and a 
uniformed officer forced him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Muller said the officers searched him, cuffed him and began questioning him, 
until they realized they had the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more surprised than scared," Muller said about the 15-minute ordeal. "I 
told them who I was, but they didn't believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Crader and his alleged accomplice, identified as Charles Robert Wharton, 28, of 
Huntington Beach, were booked in Fullerton City Jail on suspicion of bank 
robbery, police said. Additional charges of evading arrest are expected to be 
filed against Crader, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The money taken during the robbery was found in the Camaro, police said.

LOCAL MARINES COULD HEAD OUT FOR MIDEAST; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: WHILE OFFICIALS REFUSED TO CONFIRM ANY MOVEMENT, MARINES AND THEIR 
DEPENDENTS AT EL TORO AND TUSTIN REPORTED GREATER ACTIVITY AT BASES.

<P>
With tensions rapidly escalating in the Middle East, Marine Corps troops from 
El Toro and Tustin could soon be called into action to provide air support for 
American forces being dispatched to Saudi Arabia, Pentagon sources and the 
local military said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials would not confirm reports of troop movements, but enlisted 
men and their families at the El Toro and Tustin Marine Corps air stations said 
both bases were buzzing with heightened activity. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some sources indicated that plans were being made to move troops and 
equipment to the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, a 
932-square-mile desert base in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Twentynine Palms is headquarters for the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, a 
specially trained group designed to "deploy in response to contingencies 
threatening U.S. vital interests," according to the base's public affairs 
office. 
</P>
<P>
If that brigade is activated to respond to the crisis in the Persian Gulf, 
troops from El Toro and Tustin would join thousands of others from Southern 
California, Arizona and Hawaii as part of a 17,000-man rapid-deployment unit 
that combines air, land, naval and amphibious forces. 
</P>
<P>
That brigade is one of three that could be sent to Saudi Arabia in coming days, 
Pentagon sources said, the others being based in Hawaii and at Camp Lejeune, 
N.C. The chosen brigade could be flown to the Persian Gulf as early as 
Saturday, when ships loaded with equipment will begin to arrive there, the 
sources added. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, several of the bases that provide troops to the 7th Brigade were 
bustling with activity, leading soldiers and family members to speculate that 
deployment was not far off. A helicopter mechanic at the Tustin base would not 
comment on whether troops are already being dispatched from the base but said 
it was probable that they would be. 
</P>
<P>
At El Toro, a woman whose husband is a radar technician said that Marines there 
are working extra-long shifts and have been ordered to pack their bags. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks they're going, but I don't want (him) to go," the woman said. "I'm 
too scared. This is the second time we've been scared. Before, with Panama, we 
were scared, but they didn't choose his squadron." 
</P>
<P>
If a Marine expeditionary brigade is dispatched to the Middle East, forces from 
throughout the region would likely participate, military literature indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The 7th Brigade, whose motto is "One call gets its all," includes combat ground 
units from Camp Pendleton and air combat forces from El Toro, Tustin, Pendleton 
and Yuma, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
A service-support group, known in military circles as "beans, Band-Aids and 
bullets," would accompany the troops. It would be drawn from Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of soldiers at Pendleton said they too had heard that units were 
heading for Twentynine Palms. According to the wife of one Marine lieutenant, 
her husband told her that his 900-man battalion was heading to the San 
Bernardino base on Tuesday and Wednesday. He did not say where they were going 
after that, the woman added, "but by how he acted -- and I know him -- I got 
the impression he was going to the Mideast." 
</P>
<P>
A Marine Corps major based at Camp Pendleton, who requested anonymity, warned 
that military families may be overreacting to troop movements, which might be 
little more than routine training exercises. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not officially on alert," he said. "But various units have been told to 
do the things their units would normally do to bring themselves up to readiness 
and to be ready to move out. . . . We're at an administrative be-prepared 
status. People are drawing in to their units, getting records in line and 
packing up." 
</P>
<P>
If the 7th Brigade is called into action, forces would likely be dispatched 
from Twentynine Palms and would link up with the group's five supply ships, 
which are normally based on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Ships from 
there have already been sent to the Persian Gulf, and they contain enough 
weapons, vehicles, parts, fuel and rations to support the brigade for 30 days 
of combat. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro and Tustin would supply that force with its military aircraft, and as 
such would be responsible for providing air cover to the thousands of troops on 
the ground, using a combination of helicopters and warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro is home to the F/A-18 fighter jet, RF-4 Phantom jet, A-6E 
fighter-bomber, A-4 Skyhawk jet and KC-130 tanker. The air station at Tustin, a 
helicopter base, houses the CH-53E Super Stallion, the CH-53 Sea Stallion and 
CH-46 Sea Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Some 7,700 Marines are stationed at El Toro, 4,300 at Tustin and more than 
40,000 at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The El Toro base is the command center of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, the 
Marine Corps' largest such group, encompassing four western U.S. bases and more 
than 500 aircraft. The aircraft range from the small but deadly Cobra 
helicopter based at Camp Pendleton to the sophisticated F/A-18 Hornet at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The wing has 16,200 Marines based at El Toro, Tustin, Camp Pendleton and Yuma, 
Ariz. The fighters and the helicopters, including giant Ch-53E Super Stallions 
based at Tustin, are worth more than $50 billion, and some of the helicopters 
and fighter planes are valued at more than $20 million each.

DIANNE KLEIN: A MUCH-NEEDED LIFT FOR ALL US POTENTIAL CRIME VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday was National Night Out Against Crime. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you knew this, and maybe you participated -- by turning on your outdoor 
lights, or attending a block party, or marching in a parade -- but odds are 
good that you did not. 
</P>
<P>
National Night Out is an annual event, begun in 1984. This year its organizers 
say some 21 million people joined in nationwide, although apparently not too 
many of them were in Southern Californian. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the event is to show the bad guys that we won't take it any 
more -- which of course, we will, and we do -- and to give all of us potential 
crime victims a psychological lift. 
</P>
<P>
Which, cynicism aside, is not such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us could use just such a psychic boost right about now. Drive-by 
shootings, rape, child abuse, robbery, another drunken driver death. It's news 
like this that stirs our fear. Only the naive and uninformed, these days, can 
believe that crime can't happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
The other night our telephone rang, at 4 a.m. It was our neighbor, a single 
mother, calling to let us know that she had just seen a prowler jump the fence. 
The police were en route. 
</P>
<P>
What could we do with this information, my husband and I thought, other than 
check the locks yet another time and lie awake with worry? Which is what we 
did. The man was never found. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as I write this, I hear that police captured three people this morning in 
the parking lot of our local supermarket, where they ended up after a 22-minute 
chase. The police believe one of these people had just shot a man five times at 
a freeway rest stop. For no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
So what I think as I hear this is that I am lucky that I wasn't there, with my 
daughter, buying milk as all of this went down. And then I think back that we 
were lucky, too, that the neighborhood prowler decided to skip our house. This 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
I know that in the larger scheme of things, such thoughts are trivial. Orange 
County, according to the latest FBI report, has less crime per capita than 
areas of comparable size. The most recent statistics from the California Crime 
Index, however, show an overall 5.5% jump in major crimes in the county. 
Homicide took the biggest leap, up nearly 19% from 1988 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Still, our particular neighborhood is safer than most. As far as I know, none 
of my neighbors sells drugs, or steals cars, or harbors any fugitives in their 
home. And I, for one, have no deep psychological scars gouged into me at the 
point of a knife, or from the barrel of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
But yet I have fears -- that someday I, or a member of my family, or a friend, 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Peskin, national project coordinator for the National Assn. of Town Watch, 
the Pennsylvania-based organization behind the National Night Out, says that 
most Americans do. National surveys bear this out. 
</P>
<P>
Peskin mentions our fast-paced lives, with parents at work, kids hanging out 
with their friends, neighbors who wouldn't know each other if they went bump in 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Which is what criminals love. 
</P>
<P>
Turn on the lights, meet the neighbors, keep an eye out for your new friends, 
then the criminals, like cockroaches, will scurry back toward the dark. That 
was the theory behind Tuesday's Night Out. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall idea is to re-create the neighborhoods of the '40s and '50s where 
people looked out for each other and knew the cop on the beat," Peskin says. 
"Generally, most people want to be neighborly. . . . And if (the Night Out) 
didn't have long-term benefits, beyond some promotional thing, we wouldn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Boyd, who has lived in Corona del Mar since 1963, says she is a case in 
point. After a man followed her home from the bank around Christmas in 1984, 
then grabbed her purse as she stepped out of her car, neighbors alerted by her 
screams called police. The man went to jail, and Jean formed a neighborhood 
watch group. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, as part of the National Night Out, neighbors met at her home to 
talk about crime prevention with an officer from the Newport Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we look out for each other," Boyd says. "It's like a buddy system. We 
tell people, if there are things that aren't right, please call the police." 
</P>
<P>
And Sgt. Mike Gray, of the Anaheim police, says that the Night Out is great 
P.R. In Anaheim, he says, more than 6,000 neighbors got together at block 
parties throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a chance to advertise," Gray says. "And for the normal officer 
to go out where people are celebrating, rather than complaining, it's sort of a 
neat experience." 
</P>
<P>
On a broader level, of course, no one can measure just how beneficial such 
feel-good gimmicks as the Night Out really are. I'm thinking of the "Hands 
Across America" stunt of a few years back. Here, again, the glow faded fast. 
</P>
<P>
After celebrating the National Night Out Against Crime, millions of Americans 
made sure to lock their doors before they went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Which, let there be no doubt, is simply the prudent thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we all have our fears," says Gerri Winkelman, a Tustin therapist who 
counsels victims of violent crime. "I have mine. It is rational to be aware of 
the fact that you are surrounded by crime. . . . And the more knowledgeable 
that you become, the more suspicious and the more cautious that you are. . . . 
This just makes good sense." 
</P>
<P>
David Mann, a clinical psychologist in Mission Viejo, says the same. Crime 
victims, too often, are unaware of risks. When their luck does run out, the 
trauma of victimization can be that much more severe. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe next year, on the first Tuesday in August, even more Americans will 
turn on their lights and gather in the streets with their neighbors as part of 
a Night Out Against Crime. 
</P>
<P>
A little symbolic empowerment might not lower the crime rate immediately, but 
then again, it just might help.

2ND LATINO YOUTH IS KILLED ON I-5 IN LESS THAN A DAY; 
</P>
<P>
CHECKPOINT: HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP WANTS SAN CLEMENTE STATION ELIMINATED. CALTRANS 
OFFICIAL SAYS 'VERY RADICAL' CHANGES ARE IN THE OFFING.

<P>
Stunned by the second freeway death of a Latino child within 24 hours, human 
rights activists Thursday called for removal of the U.S. Border Patrol 
checkpoint on Interstate 5 as state officials pondered "radical" steps to 
reduce risks for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday night, a Latino youth, believed to be a teen-ager, was struck 
and killed in the southbound lanes about two miles south of the San Clemente 
checkpoint. Authorities said he and a group of other Latinos were crossing from 
east to west. The boy remained unidentified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours earlier, Constantino Loreto Marin, 8, of Acapulco was killed 
by a car as he dashed across the freeway to avoid detection by federal 
officers. Marin and his family, believed to be illegal immigrants, were on 
their way to visit relatives in Anaheim, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting to the point where we should eliminate the checkpoint altogether," 
said Roberto Martinez of the American Friends Services Committee, a human 
rights group in San Diego. "Every life is important and precious. If this 
checkpoint is creating more problems, we should move it somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Despite continuous meetings with Caltrans, California Highway Patrol officials 
and other immigrant groups, Martinez said, the number of pedestrian fatalities 
has increased near the Border Patrol station about five miles south of San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"This Since 1987, at least 33 pedestrians have been killed near the Border 
Patrol substation, known as the "second border." All are believed to have been 
illegal immigrants who were trying to cross Interstate 5 after being dropped 
off in the median by smugglers. For the same period, 83 immigrants have died on 
freeways within five miles of the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol spokesman Ted A. Swofford in San Diego said closing the San 
Clemente checkpoint is not feasible and that the risks can be substantially 
reduced by a host of proposals, some of which are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
"The checkpoint is a vital part of our operation, and I don't think closing it 
is an option," Swofford said. "It's not the checkpoint at fault. It's the 
smugglers." 
</P>
<P>
Because they rarely encounter high-speed freeway traffic, Martinez said, 
illegal immigrants can easily misjudge oncoming cars as they try to cross four 
lanes, many times in the dead of night. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have any concept of the freeway," Martinez said. "Many of them are 
from rural areas and they don't realize the speeds. Can you imagine their 
terror when they have to run across it?" 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation, stung by criticism that it has not 
done enough to reduce the carnage, is considering a number of responses, 
including reducing the 55 m.p.h. speed limit in areas where immigrants have 
been hit. 
</P>
<P>
"When we look at all the things that we've done so far, the fact is that the 
fatalities keep mounting, so obviously we haven't been very effective," said 
James L. Larson, a Caltrans spokesman. "We're ready to do some things that are 
very non-traditional and very radical." 
</P>
<P>
Among the options, Larson said, is the reduction of speed limits along freeways 
in the two principal trouble zones -- the immediate border area in San Diego 
and a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 5 north of Oceanside -- and the 
construction of a barrier in the median along the freeway north of Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
A barrier in the center divider theoretically could deter pedestrians from 
crossing the roadway, but undocumented immigrants have proved adept at 
surmounting a wide range of physical obstacles in the border area. 
</P>
<P>
As for a reduced speed limit, Larson said its effectiveness depends on the 
California Highway Patrol, which may not have enough officers to enforce it. 
Larson added that a reduced speed limit and other ideas are in the discussion 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has already installed small warning signs and lights on parts of the 
freeways. It is in the process of installing huge overhead signs warning 
drivers of the potential presence of pedestrians on Interstate 5 as well as 
Interstate 805 in the immediate vicinity of the border next to Tijuana. 
However, those signs will not be in operation until January. 
</P>
<P>
But Claudia Smith, regional counsel in Oceanside for California Rural Legal 
Aid, which provides legal help to immigrants, said the state agency had been 
"dragging its feet" in response to an urgent problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone's got to move on this," Smith said Thursday. "There's no way to 
eliminate the problem, but we've got to do everything we can to reduce it."

HAUSDORFER TO RUN FOR A FOURTH TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ending speculation that he would not run for a fourth term, Mayor Gary L. 
Hausdorfer this week filed to run for City Council in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of Hausdorfer, a mortgage banker, and two other incumbents, Phillip 
R. Schwartze and Anthony L. Bland, all expire in November. 
</P>
<P>
Bland and Schwartze are expected to announce whether they will seek reelection 
during a press conference at 4 p.m. today at City Hall. If either Bland or 
Schwartze decides not to run, the time period for candidate filing will be 
extended from 5 p.m. today to 5 p.m. Wednesday. Hausdorfer has long been 
considered the most politically ambitious of the council members and has often 
been mentioned as a candidate for a congressional seat. But he brushes aside 
such talk. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Politically interested' is probably a better way to put it," Hausdorfer 
said. "I think somebody once asked me what type of other political office 
interested me and I mentioned the possibility of something on the federal 
level. Ever since then, people have been saying I'm running for Congress. But I 
think anyone seriously considering running for higher office wouldn't stay on a 
City Council for 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that one of the three incumbents might not run, thereby 
breaking up a council that has been together for 10 years, has stimulated 
interest in the race. As of Thursday, 17 people have taken out candidate 
papers, but only four had returned them. LEN HALL

LONGER DAY FOR SOME 8TH-GRADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERYLANNE BEALER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some junior high students in the Capistrano Unified School District will have a 
longer school day, thanks to a decision by the Board of Trustees this week to 
add an extra period to the school day as part of a new eighth-grade science 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the fall of 1991, eighth-graders will be required to take a 
semester of science but may voluntarily take the class as a zero or seventh 
period. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are offering the extra period to students who might be 
forced to drop elective classes during the normal school day to meet the 
science requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Board members approved the measure by a 6-1 vote. Trustee Annette Gude 
dissented, saying that increased science requirements would force more 
non-college bound students to drop out of school. 
</P>
<P>
Gude also objected to a provision in the measure requiring parents to provide 
transportation for students taking the extra class. Children whose parents 
could not provide transportation would be forced to take the class during the 
day, she said. But Asst. Supt. Bill Eller said that extra bus service would 
cost $160,000 each school year. CHERYLANNE BEALER

INSANITY PLEA IN STALKING ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who has acknowledged stalking a former Irvine high school classmate for 
seven years, and then hitting her over the head with a baseball bat a year ago, 
pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity Friday to assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Schumacher, 22, who was being treated at Patton State Hospital in San 
Bernardino County until psychiatrists deemed him fit to stand trial a few 
months ago, is to return to the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Myron S. 
Brown on Oct. 3 for further legal hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's lawyer said his client needs more help and counseling, not 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
But 21-year-old Catherine Cline, who suffered a concussion and some hearing 
loss when she was attacked by Schumacher while outside her Placentia home on 
June, 19, 1989, wants him put away for the maximum term of seven years. She 
said she worries he may still be obsessed with her. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, after hearing testimony about the case, Municipal Judge Margaret 
R. Anderson concluded that Schumacher had a "fatal attraction" to Cline. The 
judge ordered him to stand trial on the assault charges and refused to lower 
his $150,000 bail. He remains in custody.

LAST-MINUTE VOTE ON MEASURE SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a race against the clock, the City Council will hold an unusual meeting 
today to vote on a proposed ballot measure for the Nov. 6 election. The filing 
deadline for ballot measures is 5 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider a rival ballot measure to an initiative already 
placed on the ballot by Save Our Parks, an environmental group. The Save Our 
Parks initiative is a proposed city charter amendment that would forbid the 
city from selling or leasing park or beach land unless approved by a citywide 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will vote today on an alternative proposal that would still 
allow the city to lease -- but not to sell -- park and beach land without a 
citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Duchene, a leader of a parents coalition backing a proposed Youth Sports 
Complex to be built in Central Park, urged the City Council to adopt the less 
restrictive measure. Duchene said that if the Save Our Parks initiative is 
approved by the voters on Nov. 6, the Youth Sports Complex will face an 
expensive citywide referendum vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not force our kids and their parents to wage expensive political 
campaigns just to have a place to play in our community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in rebuttal, John Fisher, a leader of Save Our Parks, said he believes the 
Youth Sports Complex could be built without requiring a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Youth Sports Complex advocates are not seeking to buy or lease park land. 
But Duchene has noted that one provision of the Save Our Parks initiative would 
prohibit, in existing parks, any new building costing $100,000 or more unless 
approved by a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
Duchene said that provision would necessitate getting voter approval of the 
Youth Sports Complex, because it would certainly cost at least that much. 
Fisher, however, has argued that the project need not cost $100,000 and, 
therefore, would not require a citywide vote. BILL BILLITER

CHAMBER QUESTIONS SCHOOL SUPT. OUSTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Expressing "shock and sadness" over the resignation of Huntington Beach City 
School District Supt. Diana Peters, the city's Chamber of Commerce has asked 
the district's school board members to fully explain why they wanted Peters to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' resignation was tersely announced by the school board on July 25. The 
board said it was paying Peters $126,952 in exchange for her resignation from a 
contract that did not expire until June, 1993. Board President Sherry Barlow 
said the resignation represented "an amicable resolution of philosophical 
differences between the board and the superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
Barlow and other board members declined to elaborate, saying that the 
resignation agreement prohibited both them and Peters from publicly discussing 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber of Commerce president Art Aviles, in a July 30 letter to Barlow, said 
the chamber's board has "serious concerns over the (school) board's actions." 
</P>
<P>
Aviles asked Barlow to inform the chamber why "philosophical differences" 
occurred between the board and superintendent only months after the board had 
extended her contract and given her a glowing review. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers and parents in the school district claim that the teachers' union 
put pressure on the school board to oust Peters. Leaders of the union blame 
Peters for labor tensions in the district in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, who have twice taken a "no confidence" vote against Peters, have 
charged that she was more interested in promoting her own image, including 
within the Chamber of Commerce, than she was in helping school employees. 
Supporters of Peters, however, said that Peters worked with the business 
community solely to get more funds and support for the schools. BILL BILLITER

SURVEYS WILL ASK RESIDENTS' CONCERNS

<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to shape the future of Buena Park, 30,000 surveys are being 
distributed this week asking residents what they think of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaires are part of Vision 2010, a citywide planning project 
recently approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is get a survey into the hands of every resident, one 
per household," said Andy Rich, chairman of the special task force overseeing 
the project. "We are looking for perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
As many as 10 resident committees may be formed to study issues found to be 
most critical, Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaires kick off a yearlong campaign to get residents and business 
owners involved in the city's planning process. Since June, a committee of 10 
people selected by the council have worked to launch the project. The 
questionnaires are due by Aug. 24, but officials estimate that recommendations 
to the City Council won't be completed until next June. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which is being distributed in two local newspapers, asks residents 
open-ended questions such as what is good about the city, what needs improving 
and what Buena Park should be like in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A questionnaire in Spanish will also be circulated, Rich added. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Phil Walsh said 94 surveys have been returned so far and that 
the major concerns cited were traffic, gangs and graffiti. LYNDA NATALI

GOLDEN WEST NABS 2ND MATH GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golden West College has captured its second grant this year from the National 
Science Foundation, bringing to $94,000 the foundation's awards to strengthen 
the mathematics department and the teaching of calculus, college officials said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The NSF last month approved $36,000 for a pilot project at the college aimed at 
developing computer programs to simulate complex mathematical concepts that can 
be difficult for students to conceptualize, Golden West spokeswoman Lori Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The mathematics department was awarded a $58,000 matching grant in May to buy 
computer software that will aid calculus and pre-calculus students in the 
classroom. Golden West's grants adviser Kathryn A. Crown said she has raised 
$10,000 in matching funds from the Educational Foundation of America. She is 
seeking another $45,000 in private grants to match the NSF award. 
</P>
<P>
Crown said it is rare for a community college to get any grants from the 
prestigious science agency and that it is a measure of the increasing national 
emphasis on early and higher quality science and mathematics instruction.

"To get two National Science Foundation grants is a rather extraordinary 
event," Crown said. "Before, unless we had a nationally known instructor here, 
we wouldn't have been considered." 
</P>
<P>
But with fewer American students entering the science and mathematics fields, 
especially teachers who can produce the next generation of scientists and 
mathematicians, agencies such as the NSF are putting their funds behind 
programs aimed at increasing the pool of potential science majors. 
</P>
<P>
"(NSF officials) are beginning to realize that the majority of college students 
start in community colleges," Crown said. "Generally, the emphasis has been at 
the other end of the spectrum, in graduate research. Now, the emphasis is on 
getting qualified people to go into the sciences." 
</P>
<P>
The latest grant project to receive NSF funding goes to a team headed by Golden 
West mathematics professor David Horowitz. The team's goal is to use computer 
simulation to deal with such abstract concepts as linear equations and harmonic 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier grant goes to a team led by mathematics professor Jack Wadhams, who 
said the goal is to better prepare calculus students for mathematics and 
science courses at four-year colleges. KRISTINA LINDGREN

CITY'S GENERAL PLAN TO BE OVERHAULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city plans to spend $500,000 during the next two years to overhaul its 
general plan, a revision that will shape development in the city through the 
end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are seeking expert consultants, who, along with city staff 
members, will review areas such as land use, traffic, smog, growth management 
and waste recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Except for revising the plan for housing needs and making some other minor 
changes, the General Plan has not been updated since 1976. The 14-year-old 
housing plan was revised first because the state requires it be updated every 
four years. The state recommends that the core of the general plan be updated 
every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission in March called for changes in the general plan, saying 
the aging document has complicated and, in some cases, even hindered the 
regular development process. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, outdated zoning has often caused bureaucratic headaches for 
commissioners and city staff officials handling new development proposals, 
commission Chairwoman Geri Ortega said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The land-use section of the plan, which regulates zoning, is scheduled to be 
revamped as soon as the city hires a consultant, according to a city officials, 
who expect the section to be completed by June, 1991. JOHN PENNER

PARRISH ENDS 0-FOR-21 DROUGHT WITH GAME-WINNING HR IN 11TH

<P>
Lance Parrish dreaded facing Red Sox reliever Dennis Lamp in the 11th inning 
late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's anybody in the game who's got my number, it's him," Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
But other pitchers could have made the same claim, Parrish having gone hitless 
in 21 previous at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pretty frustrating," Parrish said. "It feels good to finally get a 
hit and make it count." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish ended his slump with a two-run home run into the left-field seats, 
giving the Angels an 8-6 victory in a game that took 4 hours 6 minutes. 
Parrish's hit took the burden of guilt off Dave Winfield, whose misplay of 
Carlos Quintana's seventh-inning fly ball led to a four-run rally that put the 
Red Sox ahead, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we came back," said Winfield, who began a three-run outburst in the 
eighth with a single to left and started the ninth with a walk. "I didn't want 
that on my conscience. That really opened the floodgates." 
</P>
<P>
Once the Angels turned the tide, Boston's bullpen couldn't hold them back. Red 
Sox Manager Joe Morgan has begun to wonder whether his club can hold off its 
American League East rivals without stopper Jeff Reardon, who was lost to back 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awful to let that club get that many runs against you late in the game," 
Morgan said. "I will be (concerned) if things continue this way, believe me. If 
you don't get quality relief pitching, it's all over."

DISNEYLAND PIGSKIN GAME; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP FOR COLORADO, TENNESSEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colorado and Tennessee are about to embark on what they trust will be 13-game 
seasons, and their coaches want the teams to remember this: The bowl game is 
the one at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The game they will play at Anaheim Stadium Aug. 26, the first Disneyland 
Pigskin game, only has the look of a bowl game, matching two teams that 
finished the 1989 season with 11-1 records and enter this season ranked among 
the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to treat this like a bowl game because it's just the first game 
of a long season," said Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, who guided the Buffaloes 
through an emotion-charged season last year during which quarterback Sal Aunese 
died of complications from stomach cancer in September. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado, dedicating its season to Aunese and making a memorial of his locker, 
went undefeated last year until a 21-6 loss to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl 
left them a step shy of a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Garten, Colorado's consensus All-American offensive lineman from Valencia 
High School and a contender for the Outland Trophy this season, said the team 
has been ready to reassert itself since that loss. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet," Garten said. "We wanted to start it right then." 
</P>
<P>
They are back for another run, this time behind a coach whose job is secure for 
the rest of his career. McCartney, who turns 50 this month, signed a 15-year 
contract in July. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Colorado will make its run behind Darian Hagan, the junior whom 
Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors calls the "most exciting quarterback I have seen 
run the option in my entire coaching career." 
</P>
<P>
Hagan ran for 1,004 yards last season and passed for 1,002 in the offense that 
has come to be known as the I-bone, and finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado will be without running back Eric Bieniemy, who is suspended for the 
game for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee will begin this season against a team whose name is not much 
different from last year's opening opponent, Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers struggled against a lesser opponent before winning, 17-14. They 
cannot afford to start slowly this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big game," Tennessee quarterback Andy Kelly said. "Colorado is a big 
challenge this early in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's only loss last season was to Southeastern Conference rival Alabama, 
47-30, and Majors focuses his attention on the SEC race. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd swap this for a conference win," he said. "I'd swap anything for a 
conference win." 
</P>
<P>
Majors breathed a sigh of relief this summer when he learned running back Chuck 
Webb had satisfied academic eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Chuck Webb has the talent to be as fine a running back as there is in 
the country," Majors said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb rushed for an average of 123.6 yards a game last season, despite not 
becoming a starter until the sixth game. 
</P>
<P>
Game organizers said 25,000 to 30,000 tickets have been sold for the game.

CYCLING: ROAD CONDITIONS RELAYED, TIMES RECORDED AT DOWNEY SHOP, WHICH IS 
COMMUNICATIONS HEADQUARTERS FOR RACE ACROSS AMERICA.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the number of incoming telephone calls increases at the Downey Cyclery, the 
headquarters of the Race Across America, Julie Degraffenreid goes to the back 
of her brother's shop to wake up station supervisor Randy Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, of Placentia, will spend nearly 24 hours a day at the bicycle shop 
during the RAAM, a 2,922-mile trek from Irvine to Savannah, Ga. Evans took two 
weeks off from work and is managing a staff of 15 volunteers who record times 
and maintain communication between the timing stations, road officials and 
cyclists along the course. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, so far, have helped the competitors in many ways. A timing 
station in Mexican Hat, N.M., for instance, was supposed to be at a Best 
Western Hotel. The hotel's name had been changed, however, and volunteers 
alerted the riders and crews before anyone got lost. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers also have warned riders about unexpected road construction near 
Pagosa Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the incoming phone calls to RAAM headquarters are from officials at 
timing stations reporting times or from riders' escorts finding out who is 
ahead of them and how far they are from the front of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we'll get five or six calls in a couple of hours," said Shawn 
Nelson, who worked at the headquarters Wednesday morning along with Evans and 
Degraffenreid. "But other times we'll get five or six calls in 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson took calls Wednesday morning from the news media and fans who were 
following the race while Degraffenreid took calls from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Racers' times through timing stations and their positions in the pack are shown 
on a large television screen hooked up to the RAAM headquarters computer. The 
names of riders with penalties are recorded on paper taped to the wall, and a 
hand-drawn chart with each riders' name and number leans next to the 
television. Three tables, covered with telephones, the computer terminal, paper 
and a fax machine, are clustered around the television. 
</P>
<P>
Though all three of the volunteers at those tables Wednesday morning were 
cyclists, none could imagine themselves riding in a RAAM. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nelson, who rides in criteriums and road races: "Eight straight days on 
the bike is a little much. Eight hours is pushing it." 
</P>
<P>
Evans is a member of the Orange County Wheelmen cycling club and is deeply 
involved in the organization and officiating of the RAAM and other races. But 
she does not compete at all. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' seat in the Downey Cyclery -- despite its distance from the course -- 
might be the best spot to view the race. 
</P>
<P>
Evans enjoys hearing and repeating the stories from all over the course. "(Race 
director) John Marino called early and said it was the worst first day in the 
history of RAAM," Evans said. "He said there was a 110-degree temperature 
through the Arizona desert. He called and said, 'I'm sitting here in the cab of 
my van and I'm almost suffering heat stroke.' "

FLORIDA'S KISH IS LEADER AT HALFWAY POINT

SNYDER, Texas 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Cone probably means little to most travelers on Texas Route 207. 
The town has fewer than 300 people, a few broken-down pickups and a handful of 
small stores, most of them vacant. 
</P>
<P>
But to the Race Across America riders, Cone's location makes it memorable. 
Getting there means they are halfway through the 2,922-mile cross-country 
bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Kish of Port Orange, Fla., was the first of the men's leaders to pass 
through Cone at about noon (PDT) Thursday. Kish spent the rest of the day 
holding on to the lead he gained Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Kish, a 35-year-old land surveyor, was in Snyder -- 1,542 miles into the race 
-- at 9 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fourney of Denver, Wednesday's leader, is in second place, 1 hour 53 
minutes behind Kish. Al Muldoon of St. Joseph, Mich., is third, three hours 
back. Rich Fedrigon of Chicago is fourth, four hours off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Penseyres of San Juan Capistrano is ninth, nearly 19 hours behind Kish. 
</P>
<P>
This is Kish's fifth RAAM and his best finish was fifth place in 1988. He was 
seventh last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's feeling great," one of Kish's crew members said. "He's out front and he 
loves it. He's never been there before." 
</P>
<P>
Most past winners say the race really doesn't start until the riders reach the 
Mississippi River, but Kish still has to be the early favorite. 
</P>
<P>
He is 667 miles from the river, but the remainder of the race will be on mostly 
flat roads in humid conditions, something the Florida resident is used to. 
</P>
<P>
The women's race is closer now that the top three riders have cleared the 
mountains in Colorado. After 1,106 miles, Nancy Reposo of Newport, R.I., 
continues in front, but has only a 1-hour 50-minute lead as of 9 p.m. (PDT) in 
Trinidad, Colo. She led by nearly 11 hours Wednesday night. Cheryl Marek of 
Seattle has moved from fifth place to second. Michelle Grainger of Portland, 
Ore., is third, 3 hours 21 minutes off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The tandem team of Lon Haldeman of Harvard, Ill., and Pete Penseyres of 
Fallbrook had been in the lead the past two days, but nutritional troubles for 
Penseyres have slowed them considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Breedlove of Des Moines, Iowa, and Roger Charleville of Cincinnati have 
opened up a 17-hour lead. The two are even with the women's leaders, after 
starting the race Monday, a day after the individual riders left. 
</P>
<P>
Texas will represent the longest challenge to the riders, who will be in the 
Lone Star state for 773 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Although the scenery changes some, the length of time in the state is expected 
to be the biggest mental test for the riders, according to Randy Ice, a 
physical therapist who works with several of them. 
</P>
<P>
"They pride themselves on being big in Texas," Ice said. "But it's going to be 
a real big problem."

VANS UNMATCHED IN QUICKLY FILLING ORDERS FOR CUSTOM SHOES 
</P>

When it comes to colors, few shoemakers can rival Vans. The company's canvas 
sneakers are sold in more than 30 different shades and prints, from red 
checkerboard to little green fish swimming through a sea of black-and-white 
swirls. 
</P>
<P>
But when a retailer recently placed a large order for sneakers in bright 
purple, green and orange, Vans didn't have them. But the shoe manufacturer 
promised that it could make them -- fast. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the Vans secret. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no shoe company that can respond as quickly," boasted company 
President Richard Leeuwenburg, sinking back onto a couch while pointing the 
waffle soles of his light-colored Vans sneakers at a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the retailer had uncovered a fashion trend that had eluded 
the rest of the shoe industry. The purple, green and orange shoes are expected 
to be so popular with the back-to-school crowd that Vans is featuring them in 
its billboard ads. 
</P>
<P>
Vans, founded in 1966 as the Van Doren Rubber Co., rose to dizzying success in 
the wake of the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." Actor Sean Penn wore 
a pair of checkerboard Vans in the film, sparking a wave of teen-age copycats 
who snatched up every pair they could find. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to cash in on its hit product, Van Doren Rubber expanded quickly by 
building new stores -- too quickly, as it turned out. When the fad died out, 
sales plummeted and the company suddenly was stuck with the big debt incurred 
during its expansion. By 1984, the company had filed for protection from 
creditors in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. But it didn't stay there 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The company emerged a year later and was sold to a Menlo Park venture capital 
firm, McCown De Leeuw &amp; Co. Leeuwenburg (the similarity between his name 
and the venture capital firm's is only coincidental) took over the company and 
has embarked on a strategy of expansion beyond Southern California. The 
48-year-old executive said the East Coast and foreign markets are ripe for 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
He said the shoes are especially popular in Mexico and Europe. Sales in Mexico 
would have been even better, Leeuwenburg said, except for a counterfeit ring 
that flooded the Mexican market with cheaply made knockoffs of Vans shoes. The 
counterfeit ring was broken up by Mexican authorities, but not before the 
company lost an estimated $4 million in profits in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping that the counterfeiting problem is behind it, Leeuwenburg predicts a 
strong year for the shoemaker. At least one industry observer agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole fashion-active look . . . is one of the biggest-growing 
categories," said Dick Silverman, editor of the 30,000-circulation Footwear 
News, a New York-based trade publication. "That market overall is in good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the company's success, Leeuwenburg said, is the ability of the 
1,500-employee manufacturing plant to handle special orders as well as the 
company's stock. The flexibility also allows the company to quickly adopt new 
fabrics or colors into its lines so that it can stay on the cutting edge of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the 75,000 pairs of shoes that the company manufactures this year 
will be custom-ordered. Customers can select shoes in different colors and 
shades from the company's catalogue, and retailers can place special orders for 
large volumes. Custom shoes cost $2 to $5 more than the usual $30 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The company's most popular model, a lace-up sneaker, has not changed in design 
since its introduction in 1966. But by constantly adding new colors of canvas 
or stripes, the look can be simply updated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leeuwenburg acknowledges that Vans is a bit player in an industry dominated by 
the likes of Nike and Reebok. The company holds less than 10% of the sport shoe 
market and has its highest profile in Southern California, where it has 59 
company-owned retail stores. Its shoes are also sold by some large retail 
chains such as the Foot Locker. 
</P>
<P>
Vans had sales of about $70 million for its fiscal year ended in May. The 
privately held company does not disclose its profits. 
</P>
<P>
The company focuses its marketing efforts on its core customer group: males 
ages 9 to 19. It markets its shoes as a unique alternative to regular sport 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"The product itself is fun," he said.

MIDWAY WILL OFFER CHICAGO FLIGHTS IN JOHN WAYNE DEBUT

Midway Airlines said Thursday that it will begin offering two daily round-trip 
flights from Orange County to Chicago on Oct. 1, just two weeks after the new, 
$50-million terminal at John Wayne Airport opens for business. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based Midway, known as a price-cutter in most of the markets it serves, 
is the only new passenger carrier to begin service at the tightly controlled 
airport under a flight-expansion plan approved earlier this year by Orange 
County supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Braniff and Southwest airlines also were awarded flights from Orange 
County, but Braniff went bankrupt, and Southwest, protesting that it needed 
more than the two flights that the county approved to operate economically, 
withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
Midway will join United and American airlines with daily, nonstop flights to 
Chicago from Orange County, but it is the only carrier using Midway Airport 
rather than O'Hare International. Midway said it will fly 140-passenger, 
McDonnell Douglas MD-87 jets. 
</P>
<P>
The airline has not yet published regular fares on the route, a company 
spokeswoman said, but has set a six-week introductory fare schedule, to run 
from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15, with ticket purchases required by Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Under the introductory rate, a one-way, unrestricted coach ticket will be $249, 
and an unrestricted, one-way first-class ticket will be $289. Lower fares, down 
to $99 one way, will be available but are saddled with a variety of 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen at both United and American said their pricing people are reviewing 
Midway's introductory fares but have not yet decided to match them. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest unrestricted, nonstop coach fare currently available to Chicago from 
Orange County is $557.

Sales by the Seashore: If you've got surf, sand 'n' sea breezes, then there 
ain't no housing slump. 
</P>
<P>
That's what the developers of Pier Colony have discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The 130-unit condominium project, at 2nd Street and Pacific Coast Highway 
across from the Huntington Beach Pier, is 40% sold after less than three weeks 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
And 15 of the units were bought sight unseen. Those buyers, all from Japan -- 
where Haseko Group, Pier Colony's co-developer, has its headquarters -- plunked 
down deposits after seeing renderings of the project, according to a project 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The condominiums range from 861 to 1,492 square feet and are priced from 
$190,000 to $610,000. 
</P>
<P>
California Resorts International is the Huntington Beach builder developing the 
project with Haseko (California) Inc. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A nearby project by Mola Development of Newport Beach sold even faster. 
</P>
<P>
The 89-unit Townsquare -- an unusual mix of condos and town homes over retail 
shops that is situated about four blocks from the beach at 5th Street and 
Orange Avenue -- sold all 73 of the condo units the day sales opened in March. 
</P>
<P>
Prices ranging from $140,000 to $209,000 helped make up for the extra distance 
from the water. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week, a dozen of the 16 townhouses in the development had been sold, 
at prices in the low to mid-$400,000s.

RANDY LEWIS: CENSORS COULD MAKE U.S. THE LAND OF BLAND

Recent news items: 
</P>
<P>
* RENO -- Members of British heavy-metal group Judas Priest testify in a trial 
in which they are accused of planting subliminal messages in songs that 
allegedly triggered the self-inflicted deaths of two fans. 
</P>
<P>
* PHOENIX -- A supermarket chain pulls copies of "The Little Mermaid" home 
video from its shelves because a customer complains of finding a phallic symbol 
in the cover artwork. 
</P>
<P>
* KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Two newspapers refuse to run this week's Doonesbury comic 
strips because they show a female character wearing nothing but rope and a 
bucket and spouting provocative language. 
</P>
<P>
Any of these stories should be enough to send a thinking adult away shaking his 
or her head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even taken together, they represent only a smattering of cases where 
citizens, in their zeal to do the right thing, seem intent on turning America 
the Beautiful into the land of the bland, the home of the straitjacketed. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of the poor "Little Mermaid." She was sitting on shelves in video 
stores and supermarkets around the country, minding her own business, when that 
woman in Phoenix complained that she had found a (gasp) phallic symbol on the 
underwater castle on the cover. The woman insisted that the video be withdrawn, 
so as not to pollute innocent minds. (Speaking of which, what was she doing 
searching for phalluses in Disney cartoons?) And, instead of shrugging off the 
complaint as a case of someone with too much time on her hands, the store's 
management knuckled under. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the two Midwest newspapers -- one in Indiana and one in Missouri 
(the, ahem, "Show Me" state) -- that pulled the plug on Doonesbury's commentary 
on the ruckus over the National Endowment for the Arts and artistic censorship. 
The editors who decided against running the strips claimed they weren't 
appropriate to the comics, which appeal to readers of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
I hope they don't take a hard look at the "Love Is . . . " strip, which 
features young male and female characters wearing no clothes. Sometimes 
together. And they are always talking about love. This appears every day. 
</P>
<P>
Heave. Grunt. Pant. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most amazing story, though, is the one about the families suing 
CBS Records and Judas Priest because two youths killed themselves after a heavy 
session of drinking, smoking pot and listening to Judas Priest's 1978 "Stained 
Class" album. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs are out to prove that 1) there were subliminal messages saying 
"Do it" implanted on the album and that 2) these messages caused the two boys 
to take their own lives. (One died instantly; the other lived, horribly 
disfigured, for three years after the suicide attempt and then died of related 
complications.) 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the judge rules in our favor or not, I feel like we've already won," 
one mother said. "This case has brought so much public attention to the issue. 
The problems with heavy-metal music are finally out in the open. Bands are 
beginning to be censored, and I'm happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to fault parents for grieving over a child's suicide, or for 
desperately feeling the need to place blame -- but not when they start grasping 
at straws. And certainly not when attorneys set their sights on a likely victim 
(i.e., one with loads of money) and swim hungrily in for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, one of these boys came from a home where his mother 
had been married four times; where, as a youth, he was physically abused by his 
stepfather and reportedly was whipped with a belt. Both youths dropped out of 
school in the 10th grade and both used alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines and 
cocaine, among other substances. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at least one of the mothers still blames the music, saying, "Heavy metal 
changed his personality. When James started listening to Judas Priest, he lost 
all respect for authority." This even though, 12 years earlier, at the age of 
8, respectful young James, according to testimony, tried to choke that selfsame 
mother while she was driving him home from school. And that was five years 
before Judas Priest was ever heard from on record. 
</P>
<P>
Respect for authority that large could be lost in the space between a bee's 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose if this kid had spent his teen years watching the ballet, those 
physical and emotional blows would have just bounced right off him, and he'd be 
just fine today. 
</P>
<P>
Texas rocker Joe Ely wrote a song a few years ago called "Dig All Night" in 
which he pinpointed this creeping virus of finger-pointing and the chronic 
shortage of personal responsibility infecting our society: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sitting here wondering: 
</P>
<P>
 The world's gone to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we blame someone else 
</P>
<P>
 For the trouble we're in? 
</P>
<P>
 In a big easy chair 
</P>
<P>
 At the world we stare 
</P>
<P>
 As the world caves in 
</P>
<P>
 And it ain't no wonder 
</P>
<P>
 Why we don't get a break. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so easy to find 
</P>
<P>
 Someone else's mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The ripples can be felt right here in our own neighborhoods, from worrywarts 
who perceive threats from rap bands and theater producers to city councils that 
enact laws to fashion a world in which nothing ever offends anyone anywhere. 
The notion of learning to handle life's daily irritations apparently has given 
way to efforts to eliminate them all. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the dusty road to cultural maturity, we seem to have lost our 
grip on the all-important tolerance upon which this country was founded. In 
most of these examples, it's equally clear that we've mislaid any sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
Heaven forbid the time has come when we should look to Michael Jackson as a 
role model, but as long as we're quoting song lyrics, maybe we'd be better off 
spending more time trying to grasp the meaning of The Buckled One's hit "Man in 
the Mirror" than looking for pornography in Disney videos or suicide 
instructions in Judas Priest records: 
</P>
<P>
If you wanna make the world a better place, 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look at yourself and then make a change.

NEW PRINCIPALS IN AUSTRALIAN BALLET'S 'GISELLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A second set of principals could not entirely energize the Australian Ballet's 
production of "Giselle" Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
But at least the new dancers made Act II somewhat eventful and interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Fiona Tonkin brought wide-eyed naivete to Giselle, registering emotions broadly 
on her face. But she was so self-effacing and childlike that one could hardly 
credit Albrecht's interest in her. Her dancing, despite explosive, fast turns 
and spongy pointe work, remained curiously earthbound. But her mad scene 
included such arresting moments as her flinching from unseen ghosts and her 
struggling at the deadly coldness creeping over her. 
</P>
<P>
After a rough start in the unsupported balances of the adagio in the second 
act, she revealed greater control and security, and danced with more lyric 
vulnerability and pathos. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Heathcote as her Albrecht began as a standard, smug playboy, 
impatiently, hotly attentive to her. He introduced a nice character touch, 
however, with his look of aristocratic disdain as Giselle's mother mimed her 
dream of Giselle becoming a Wili. Ah, the benighted superstitions of the 
peasants. Unfortunately, his dancing here frequently lacked finish and 
carry-through of impulse. 
</P>
<P>
But in Act II, he earned his noble stature, emerging from a kind of demented, 
insulated grief to commitment to Giselle. Similarly, his dancing evidenced 
greater amplitude and strength, and he ended his trials with the Wilis with an 
extraordinary series of high-bounding leg beats. 
</P>
<P>
As Myrta, Queen of the Wilis, Jayne Beddoe made an impressive entrance, with 
glittering, skimming steps, but she may have been thrown off by the person in 
an upper balcony who could not muffle a disruptive sneeze that sent laughs 
through 
</P>
<P>
the audience. Her second crossing the stage looked less seamless and secure, 
and her extended balances became shaky and effortful. Still, she brought 
commanding, fierce attack to the role. 
</P>
<P>
In Act I, Stephen Morgante had made an intense, almost obsessive Hilarion. Lisa 
Bolte danced with careful, statuesque placement in the Peasant pas de deux. 
Campbell McKenzie offered her shaky partnering, but in his variation displayed 
springy leaps and clean beats. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Baynes' "Catalyst," previously reviewed, completed the program. John 
Lanchbery again conducted the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian Ballet performs through Sunday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. At 8 tonight, "Giselle" and 
"Catalyst." Tickets: $14 to $47. Information: (714) 556-2787.

Because of a back injury, Australian Ballet principal dancer David McAllister 
will not dance in "Giselle" tonight; David Ashmole will take his place. Anna 
deCardi will appear in the title role. It was not immediately known whether the 
injury would prevent McAllister from appearing in the company's mixed-repertory 
programs on Saturday and Sunday.

'LATE AMNESTY' SCHEME BILKS ILLEGAL ALIENS ; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: FALSE INTERPRETATION OF RECENT COURT DECISIONS IS BEHIND THE SCAM. 
THE INS SAYS THAT OF 5,456 RECENT AMNESTY APPLICATIONS, ONLY 243 QUALIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Immigrant rights advocates charged Thursday that thousands of Los Angeles-area 
illegal immigrants are being victimized by dishonest notary publics and others 
specializing in immigration work who claim the aliens qualify for a 
"late-amnesty" program that does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
They said that aliens who do not qualify for legal U.S. residency under the 
Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1986 have been given false hope of 
obtaining amnesty by unscrupulous persons who charge up to $2,000 to handle an 
application. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the applications are rejected by the INS because of the use of 
blatantly fraudulent documents, the advocates said. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of fraud has reached alarming proportions," said Cesar Noriega, an 
attorney with One Stop Immigration and Educational Center in Boyle Heights. "I 
mean, we're talking about thousands and thousands of (victimized) people." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, the advocates said that problems stemming from the 
purported late-amnesty scam have grown common in the last six months and aliens 
should be wary of anyone who claims he can easily process an application at 
this time for the legalization program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the landmark amnesty law, illegals who lived in this country since before 
Jan. 1, 1982, qualified for legal U.S. residency. An estimated 3.1 million 
aliens nationwide -- with a third of them in greater Los Angeles -- signed up 
during the one-year application period that ended May 4, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But two civil rights organizations, the League of United Latin American 
Citizens and Catholic Social Services, filed suit alleging that the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service excluded some applicants because they temporarily 
left the country during the sign-up period. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge last year ordered the INS to accept applications by those 
aliens. There are no firm figures on the number of aliens affected, but INS 
officials and some civil rights leaders have put the number anywhere from 
50,000 to 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion over who might qualify as a result of the two lawsuits has spawned a 
deluge of advertising, principally aimed at the Spanish-language community, 
that promises spurious amnistia tardia -- late amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
The effect has been startling, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said that of the 5,456 applications handled in Los Angeles last month 
because of the two lawsuits, only 243 qualified for amnesty. The rest were 
rejected because the aliens did not qualify or used false documents, said 
Robert Moschorak, the INS' district director in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers at Thursday's news conference said such advertisements and 
misinformation have dashed the hopes of people who could be subject to 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Beatriz Guillermo. She said she paid $2,300 to Yancy Hawkins, 
a paralegal in East Los Angeles, who told her he could help her obtain legal 
U.S. residency. Guillermo said she never questioned the work of Hawkins. Nor 
did she review the paperwork he prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she learned that her request for political asylum and "late amnesty" 
were rejected because of insufficient documents. Guillermo said she never 
intended to ask for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said her request for amnesty was undermined by false documents. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have asked some questions," she concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins was convicted last month by a federal court jury in Los Angeles of 
conspiracy for his involvement in the preparation of false documents for the 
"late amnesty" program. He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to 
$250,000, said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Matthew Frank.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN MECHANIC'S KILLING SEIZED AFTER 
CHASE 
</P>

<TEXT>

A woman wanted on suspicion of shooting a mechanic to death in Pacoima was 
arrested after a 15-mile chase in San Bernardino County, during which 18 shots 
were fired at a pursuing CHP officer before her auto overturned on a desert 
road. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was not injured and his car was apparently hit by only one bullet 
during the chase that ended Wednesday night when the suspect's car overturned 
on a ranch road about 35 miles east of Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi Fairchild, 27, of the Pacoima area, suffered a serious leg injury in the 
crash and was being held at San Bernardino County Medical Center on suspicion 
of attempted murder of the CHP officer, authorities said. Los Angeles police 
began seeking Fairchild Wednesday after a truck mechanic, David A. Webb, 31, of 
Mission Hills, was shot to death in an industrial yard in Pacoima. Other 
employees told investigators they saw Fairchild, the girlfriend of another 
mechanic, drive away.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 MEN ARRESTED IN RAID INDICTED ON DRUG 
CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four men arrested in a raid that netted $17.8 million in drug profits -- the 
largest such money seizure in the West -- have been indicted on narcotics 
charges, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cash and money-counting machines, prosecutors said authorities 
seized ledgers in the July 24 raid in Sylmar that could shed light on how the 
drug network operated. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Wolfe said investigators were still 
reviewing the ledgers and he could not comment on any links the suspects might 
have to major drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Two Colombians, Gilberto Saavedra, 41, and his brother, Carlos, 31, allegedly 
ran the money-laundering operation, Wolfe said. They bought the house less than 
two months before the raid. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus David Salazar, 25, and Gabriel Olguin Gaviria, 37, were also named in the 
indictment, returned this week. They allegedly were employed as money couriers 
and guards in the operation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REMAINS IDENTIFIED AS LONG BEACH WOMAN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The remains of a woman discovered by hikers near Roseburg, Ore., have been 
identified through dental records as those of a Long Beach resident who 
vanished almost two years ago, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The remains, found by hikers May 31 on private forest land 30 miles southeast 
of Roseburg, were identified as those of Estella D. Vaughan, 46, who was 
reported missing from the Long Beach area in October, 1988, said Detective Joe 
Perkins of the Douglas County major crimes unit. He said the case is being 
treated as a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
The identification of the woman also involved a nationwide computer search, 
Perkins said. Police had asked for the public's help in determining the woman's 
whereabouts before her death.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOLS CONSIDERING SHIFT IN CONSTRUCTION 
PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is considering a shift in construction 
priorities so that it will not lose $13.6 million in state funding that can 
only be used for school renovations. 
</P>
<P>
The financially strapped district may also try to recoup $18.6 million lost 
last year when the district chose not to make renovations for which state money 
was made available under a school construction and modernization bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have said the priority given to new construction has left 
the system without the staff to oversee renovations. But under a proposal 
announced Thursday, the Board of Education will be asked on Monday to shift 
construction priorities so that renovations at 52 schools can be undertaken.

<P>
Ventura County has begun replacing its 15-year-old communications system with 
one expected to meet the needs of its fast-growing agencies until the year 
2000, and which can be expanded after that. 
</P>
<P>
A new 100-foot tower at the county government center in Ventura will be the 
backbone of the $950,000 system, which will link the sheriff's, fire and public 
works departments with the county's telephone network. 
</P>
<P>
The current system carries 300 channels, and the county needs 550, said Charles 
Taylor, chief of radio communications. The new system, scheduled to begin 
operating in October, will have 672 channels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The county owns its own telephone system and it all runs through this 
microwave," Taylor said of the new tower. DARYL KELLEY

2 GUNS, 2 DEATHS, 2 GRIEVING FAMILIES; 
</P>
<P>
ADRIAN AND LUIS, NOT MEMBERS OF GANGS, STILL BECAME VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Adrian Barajas didn't smile much for a child of 10. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he loved his family and his friends and his art. But he hated violence and 
gangs and the cruelty he saw inflicted on others in his neighborhood, in the 
shadow of Dana Strand Village, a housing project in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Odette Fortier, remembers how Adrian would stand up to other kids 
on his block when they picked on a disabled boy who was a neighbor. "Adrian 
didn't want to fight, but he'd stick up for the boy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But as sensitive and smart as he was, Adrian, like any boy his age, couldn't 
resist looking at the gun his 13-year-old cousin found last Saturday in the 
cousin's apartment at Dana Strand. The .357 magnum belonged to the cousin's 
older brother, a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
The two young boys also found a bullet and loaded and unloaded the gun. Around 
2:20 p.m. or so, the telephone rang and Adrian's cousin answered it. Adrian 
asked to see the gun. And as it was passed, the gun went off. 
</P>
<P>
In an instant, Adrian was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Adrian's death is considered an accident. But to his family and 
friends and police, it represents something more. 
</P>
<P>
For the gun belonged to a gang member. And the gang member is not the one who 
died. Someone else did. Someone innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 12 hours after Adrian died, Luis Navarro was gunned down on his 21st 
birthday by a gang member. The shooting took place a few blocks from the San 
Pedro house Navarro grew up in, the house where friends, some of them gang 
members, were celebrating his birthday with a party. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Adrian nor Luis wanted any part of the gangs or the mayhem. Adrian said 
so often to his mother. So did Luis. But they both had family or friends in 
gangs. And last weekend, that was all it took for both of them to die. 
</P>
<P>
"The same message keeps coming up that even if you are not a proclaimed member 
of a gang, you can be a victim," says Los Angeles Police Capt. Joe 
DeLadurantey, who commands the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division. 
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, just before Adrian and Luis died, 11 
other people were killed in gang-related violence in the Harbor Division. By 
comparison, only five gang-related killings were recorded for the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, as with Adrian, the numbers do not tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
"His death will never show up as a gang-related killing, but the atmosphere is 
more than likely what created the circumstances that led to the tragedy," 
DeLadurantey says. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Wiggington, president of Mothers Against Gangs, is more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the gangs to realize what they're doing to their families. Without 
realizing it and having a gun in the house like that sets these children up to 
die," she says. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, police arrested Adrian's 17-year-old cousin for owning the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Odette Fortier does not want to talk about her nephew. It's hard enough 
thinking about how his gun was the one that killed her son. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish people would stop. Adrian always hated the violence," says 
Fortier, 39. "Maybe the gun wouldn't have been around if so many people weren't 
so angry, so vengeful." 
</P>
<P>
Those people, she says, include the gang members Adrian never wanted any part 
of. "He told me he was never going to be in a gang, never going to use drugs. 
He was really adamant about it," Fortier said tearfully, sitting in the living 
room of her home in Wilmington, three blocks from where her son died. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd say, 'It's not right, Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
Adrian cared a lot about what was right and wrong, according to his family and 
those who knew him at Hawaiian Avenue Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a quiet, introspective child. A bright boy who was good at problem 
solving," remembers Principal Tommye Keenan. "And he had good insight into his 
own feelings, more than you would expect from a child his age." 
</P>
<P>
The feelings emerged in Adrian's art, the drawings and the paintings he 
cherished. "The times he smiled were when he did his artwork," Keenan says. 
</P>
<P>
"When he smiled, he was a completely different boy. There was a radiant look on 
his face," she recalls. "It was like the sun coming out." 
</P>
<P>
Adrian's dream was to be an artist. "He was a great little artist," Keenan 
says. "He was able to express himself in ways that he was reluctant to do with 
words." 
</P>
<P>
If his family had its way, Adrian would have been an artist. If things had been 
different, the whole family would have moved away to a safer neighborhood, says 
Fortier, who has two other sons. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the money, I'd be gone," says Fortier. To Oregon or Northern 
California, she says. To any place where the streets are not taken over by 
gangs and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"But every place is like that," her oldest son, Steve, 21, tells his mother as 
they talk in the family's living room. 
</P>
<P>
Steve's rage over his young brother's death first turned to thoughts of 
retaliation. But, just like Adrian, he rejected that idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I should take revenge, but it's not right," he says. "It's not 
going to make anything better." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he and his family are making arrangements for a funeral that has not 
yet been set. Instead, they have set up the Adrian Barajas Fund, P.O. Box 3911 
Gardena, 90247, to help pay the $3,000 they'll need for the funeral. Instead, 
they are thanking others who have come to share in the grief over Adrian. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how many people are reaching out to help," Adrian's mother 
says. "It makes me remember the world is not all ugly violence," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's hard to forget that violence and how it took away Adrian. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still see the police and the yellow tape" Fortier says, remembering her 
arrival at Dana Strand last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
No one told her anything at first, Fortier says. Then, she told one stone-faced 
policeman she was Adrian's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer was trying so hard. He was not saying anything. But I saw it in 
his eyes that it was my baby that was shot," Fortier recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss my baby." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Luis Navarro had a lot of nicknames. But they were not the 
names common to the streets, names like "Loco" or "Solo" or "Sniper." No, 
Navarro's nicknames were endearing. 
</P>
<P>
As a kid, they used to call him "Baby Huey" because he was always big and 
chubby for his age. And when he grew into manhood, there were new nicknames. 
One friend called the likable 6-foot-1 former ship worker "Gentle Bear." And 
the girls, charmed by his rugged good looks and dimples, called him "Luscious." 
</P>
<P>
Navarro especially loved that nickname. He loved the attention from women. 
"When one of his mother's friends called on the phone and asked, 'Who's this?,' 
he'd say, 'You know, the most handsome one in San Pedro,' " remembers Debbie 
Gonzalez, a friend of Navarro since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
That was Luis. A little vain, perhaps. But friends and family remember him as 
good-hearted and friendly, a young man who never went looking for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The north San Pedro neighborhood in which he grew up is not the toughest 
around. But it's rough enough. And Luis dropped out of San Pedro High School 
two years before graduation, deciding he wanted to get a job and make money. 
</P>
<P>
His last job, at a Terminal Island shipyard, ended three months ago when he was 
laid off. But even then, Luis never ran the streets, according to those who 
knew him. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Luis always stuck close to the San Pedro home he shared with his 
widowed mother, Yolanda, and older brother, Martin. During the day, he'd sleep 
a lot or run to the store for his mother or her friends. At night, sometimes 
all night, he'd plunk himself down before the television set, watching shows or 
playing Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
With plenty of friends and time between jobs, Luis was always available to 
others, close friends and family say. "He was like everybody's older brother," 
one friend remembers. 
</P>
<P>
So many considered him family that he was soon to be godfather to two young 
children. Luis also had a son of his own, a 1-year-old boy also named Luis. But 
the boy and his mother moved to Montana months ago when, friends say, she was 
offered a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Luis stayed in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always at home," his mother says. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday night, he was still close to home, celebrating his 21st birthday 
with a party at a neighbor's house. About 40 or so of his friends showed up for 
the party, held in the neighbor's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 1 a.m. Sunday, Luis and a friend left the party to buy 
cigarettes. They jumped into his car and headed toward Gaffey Street. 
</P>
<P>
En route, a car pulled alongside Luis'. The other car, authorities say, carried 
several gang members from outside of San Pedro and one of them yelled out the 
name of their hometown. A moment later, a gang member opened fire on the car 
carrying Luis and his friend. 
</P>
<P>
"They never saw it coming," says LAPD homicide Detective Tom Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Luis, shot once in the side, tried to control his car as it continued down the 
street. But he couldn't, passing out seconds before it crashed into a parked 
car just blocks from his home. 
</P>
<P>
His friend ran back to the party for help. A witness to the accident called 
police. But by the time Luis arrived at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, he was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Why the gang members picked Luis is unclear. There were some San Pedro gang 
members at his party, but they, like everyone else, were in a back yard, out of 
sight. One theory is that he was mistaken for someone else who was dating a 
girl from the other gang's hometown. But that notion is dismissed by Luis' 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys were just out looking for someone to kill," says Martin. 
</P>
<P>
As he continues to investigate the case, Lange says this killing, like others 
involving gangs, may just be random. "It doesn't take a lot to motivate these 
gangs to violence," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, why Luis was murdered doesn't matter as much to his family and 
friends as the fact that he's gone, that his killers must be found. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want them to pay for what they did. I want them to do time," says 
Martin, who says he and his family want police, not friends, to solve the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone to take this into their own hands and get hurt," says 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want another mother crying," his mother adds. 
</P>
<P>
Luis will be buried today after an 11:30 a.m. Mass at St. Peter's Catholic 
Church in San Pedro.

TORRANCE MAY REGULATE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THE CITY COUNCIL MAY CREATE AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD ALLOW A CITY 
REGULATORY BOARD TO BAN CHEMICALS IT DEEMS TOO RISKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to regulate acutely hazardous chemicals in the city of Torrance 
moved forward this week when a committee recommended that the City Council hire 
a consultant to help design the necessary ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials say the ordinance would give the city the power to ban 
chemicals it deems too risky. And it would be more far-reaching than current 
state guidelines for hazardous substances. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would expand the role of an existing chemical board, making it 
responsible for reviewing the use of acutely hazardous chemicals. The board 
could grant a company a permit to use a chemical, require changes in the 
handling of that chemical -- or simply decline to issue a permit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an inherent right to protect the citizens of our community against 
acutely hazardous materials," said Councilman Dan Walker, a member of the City 
Council Public Safety Committee, which recommended Wednesday that the 
consultant be hired. 
</P>
<P>
City staff developed a draft ordinance, and the consultant would add specific 
guidelines to be used in enforcing the law. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for an industry group said it does not oppose the creation of the 
ordinance. He warned, however, that an ambiguous ordinance could affect 
Torrance's relations with industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a fantastic city because they've been able to achieve a balance 
between residential, industrial, light industrial and office space," said Steve 
Whitehead, a Dow Chemical Co. employee and chairman of a special committee 
studying the ordinance for the Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be disappointing and not good for the city if that balance was 
disturbed," Whitehead said in an interview after the meeting Wednesday. "You 
have to be aware of that when you're writing ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance is only one of several actions that followed a series of 
explosions, fires and accidents that have claimed three lives and caused more 
than a dozen injuries since 1987 at the 750-acre Mobil refinery in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Considerable attention was focused on hydrofluoric acid after a massive 
explosion and fire in November, 1987, released an estimated 100 pounds of the 
toxic substance. Authorities said none of the acid escaped refinery grounds and 
no one was injured by the release. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Torrance filed suit against Mobil in April, 1989, asking the court 
to declare the refinery a public nuisance and allow the city to regulate it. 
The case is due to go to trial in October. 
</P>
<P>
A ballot initiative spearheaded by Walker attempted to ban the use of 
hydrofluoric acid at the refinery, but the measure lost by a 3-1 margin earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrofluoric acid is only one of a number of acutely hazardous materials being 
used in Torrance, city officials say. The state classifies about 360 chemicals 
as "acutely hazardous." 
</P>
<P>
The city began discussing the possibility of a chemical review ordinance in 
August, 1989, and city officials have spent months drafting the broad outlines 
of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to take up the committee's recommendation in early 
September. Although the council technically would be deciding whether to hire 
the consultant, several council members say that a "yes" vote would also 
signify approval of the ordinance in concept. The city has already allocated 
$100,000 for a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Several industry representatives attended the Wednesday committee meeting, 
although most of them did not comment on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehead, speaking for the Chamber of Commerce, tried unsuccessfully to 
persuade the committee to delay forwarding the ordinance to the council, saying 
he had not had time to review it. But committee members countered that the 
Wednesday meeting had been publicized well in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been announcing this thing for the last six weeks," said Councilman Tim 
Mock, chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehead later said he is concerned about the standards that still need to be 
developed for the ordinance -- a job that city officials are leaving for the 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see guidelines and standards established before it's submitted for 
approval by the City Council," Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by city officials, the Torrance ordinance would mesh with a state 
code that requires certain companies using hazardous materials to draw up a 
so-called Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), a wide-ranging report 
of chemicals, equipment and controls. 
</P>
<P>
Those companies would also be reviewed automatically by the city chemical 
board, said Torrance Fire Chief R. Scott Adams. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical board then could approve a permit, deny it or ask a company to 
take steps to improve safeguards. A company that is denied a permit could 
appeal directly to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
However, Adams said, the proposed Torrance ordinance goes a step further than 
the state code. 
</P>
<P>
"In practice, it's entirely possible for a facility to do an RMPP that the city 
accepts and, at the same time, our community would say, 'We don't care; we 
think the risk is too great.' That's the crux of what's happening here," Adams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
How the board would determine whether a chemical poses an unacceptable risk is 
still to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The city's three-member chemical board was formed in the late 1960s but has met 
rarely, city officials said. Members of the new board would represent the fire 
department, the building and safety department, and the city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have not heard of any other cities that have developed 
an ordinance like the one proposed in Torrance. Spokesmen contacted Thursday at 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National League of Cities and the 
California League of Cities said that although they are not familiar with 
similar ordinances, they could not confirm that the one in Torrance would be 
the first of its kind in the country.

FIREFIGHTERS' FUND TO HELP BOY BURNED IN FIREBOMBING 
</P>

Inglewood firefighters have set up a fund to help a 12-year-old boy who was 
severely burned last week by homemade firebombs hurled through the front window 
of his sister's home. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell Mullen, a student at Lennox Middle School, was in stable condition 
Thursday at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital with second- and third-degree burns 
on his hands, face and back. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said he is undergoing surgical skin grafts. 
</P>
<P>
Family members, who have been visiting the boy daily, said they appreciate the 
firefighters' concern. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen's sister, Brenda Walker, who was in the house with her four children, 
said she is looking for a new home and attempting to put the fire behind her. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to worry now," she said. "I don't know why they did that to my house. I 
can't go anywhere now without looking behind my back. I almost got burned up." 
</P>
<P>
Ella Walker, another sister, said Terrell is concerned about how the burns on 
his face will affect his appearance but is handling the painful treatment well. 
</P>
<P>
"My little brother could have been dead," she said. "He's badly burned, but I 
thank God that no one died." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, arson investigators said they have identified one possible suspect 
in the fire. They declined to reveal a motive for the firebombing, which is 
being investigated as an attempted murder. Witnesses said they saw four men 
wearing white T-shirts running from the home last Wednesday night after hurling 
as many as four homemade bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to the Terrell Mullen Burn Fund can be sent to Inglewood Firefighters 
Assn., PO Box 525 Inglewood, Calif. 90307.

WEEKENDER: WITH ITS CAST OF ALL AGES, 'GYPSY' IS RIGHT AT HOME IN CARSON'S 
THEATER PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS What: "Gypsy." When: Tonight, Saturday, 8 p.m. Where: Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, University Theater, 1000 Victoria St., Carson. Admission: $10; 
students and seniors, $5. Information: 835-0212, ext. 239. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The musical "Gypsy" is a classic story about the triumphs and tribulations of 
breaking into show business. 
</P>
<P>
But in Carson, where the show is being performed tonight and Saturday at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, the city has been giving breaks to people bitten by the 
show biz bug for years. 
</P>
<P>
In a city-sponsored performing arts program, Carson's parks put on 12 shows 
each year with local children and teen-agers in the cast. During the summer, 
youngsters in elementary and high schools put on two citywide musicals. And the 
really big show every summer is the Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
It's dubbed the adult show, but in the case of "Gypsy," that's a bit misleading 
because of the host of youngsters who sing and dance in their roles as young 
vaudevillians. 
</P>
<P>
"The core is the community," said Joe Wolfson, Carson community services 
manager and fine arts director. "These are community people performing for the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the summer shows haven't had a real name. But with this year's 
"Gypsy," the venture has acquired a title: Carson Civic Light Opera. 
</P>
<P>
It also marks a new association between the city and the university, which is 
providing directors, a technical staff, sets and costumes for the annual adult 
production. The group also has rent-free use of the impressive 475-seat 
University Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Civic Light Opera is a combination of adult, youth and children's theater," 
said Vivian McClure, the group's executive director. "Working with Cal State, 
we're hoping to add more to our season . . . maybe a couple of musicals a year 
and three dramatic productions." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfson said many youngsters have grown up with theater in Carson, starting in 
shows at the parks and graduating to the Broadway musicals. "A lot of the kids 
are students at Cal State, and it made sense for the two of our worlds to join 
hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McClure said Civic Light Opera is now able to put more of its budget -- $80,000 
this year -- into productions because it no longer has to pay such overhead as 
theater rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike neighboring Long Beach, which peppers its Civic Light Opera casts with 
stars, Carson's remains a community venture with few paid hands. "We're not 
going out for Equity actors," said Wolfson, referring to the professional 
actors union. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Duran, an elementary schoolteacher and veteran of several summer musicals, 
remembers them as "a lot of fun," with casts dominated by college students, "a 
lot of them with ambitions to get into show business." Duran himself was a 
theater arts major and is still associated with civic light opera as a director 
of youth musicals. 
</P>
<P>
Professionals, though, do sometimes audition for shows. In "Gypsy," the pivotal 
role of Mama Rose -- everybody's notion of an overbearing stage mother -- is 
played by Equity actress Carol Woodbury. Cara Dennis, a Carson resident who 
sings and dances as Baby June, does commercials. 
</P>
<P>
With a professional music director and orchestra and seven weeks of rehearsal, 
McClure said, her group has worked to give "Gypsy" a polish that will make 
people take note of Carson productions. "We want people to leave the theater 
thinking we can be taken seriously and that we are putting together good 
productions that are worth the money to come to see," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the group has done some imaginative things. It staged "Barnum" in 
a circus tent complete with a live band. "The Pirates of Penzance" opened with 
a film of the pirates leaving a buccaneer sailing ship at Ports O' Call in San 
Pedro, making their way to the theater and coming up the steps. The live 
pirates then burst into the theater. 
</P>
<P>
As "Gypsy" winds up two weekends of performances, Civic Light Opera is 
rehearsing its two summer children's musicals. "Animal Krackers," with a cast 
of 18 9-year-olds, will be given Aug. 17 and 18 at 7:30 p.m. at Carson 
Elementary School. A company of teen-agers will perform "Little Luncheonette of 
Horrors," a spoof of "Little Shop of Horrors," on Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 at 8 p.m. 
at Carnegie Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
Through its various productions, McClure said, Civic Light Opera takes care of 
theater for every age group in Carson. "I feel we offer a real well-rounded 
community program," she said. "We get kids moving up the scale, one production 
to another." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Dwyer, a 15-year-old performer in "Luncheonette," got into Carson theater 
as a fifth-grader when he was bored during the summer. He said part of the 
thrill of acting is "having a live audience there, and always living on the 
edge that somebody could forget something." 
</P>
<P>
After three shows, Dwyer says, "I love it. I don't want to give it up." GERALD

WOMAN SENTENCED TO 6 YEARS FOR KILLING LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old woman who said she strangled her 60-year-old lover to end four 
years of physical abuse was sentenced Wednesday to six years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn May, who lived in Lawndale with Walter Billingsley, pleaded guilty to a 
single charge of voluntary manslaughter in connection with Billingsley's death 
on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Superior Court Judge Francis Hourigan could have sentenced May to a 
minimum of three years or a maximum of 11. 
</P>
<P>
According to a probation report, May told police that Billingsley beat her 
often during their four-year relationship. Billingsley had been beating her in 
a drunken rage on the morning of July 9 before he passed out on a bed, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
May, an admitted alcoholic and drug addict who also was drunk that morning, 
said that after Billingsley passed out, she realized she "couldn't take it 
anymore," wrapped a leather strap around his neck and choked him to death. 
</P>
<P>
Frightened by what she had done, May then ran to the house behind hers to ask 
her landlord what she should do, police said. He told her to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
A probation officer urged Hourigan to sentence May to a significant term in 
prison, warning that she needs treatment to avoid repeating the same mistakes 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"If the defendant is allowed to remain in the community, she will not work on 
the alcohol problem, and it is a possibility that she will involve herself in 
another co-dependency relationship that may again prove fatal." 
</P>
<P>
May will be eligible for parole in about three years.

HEARING ON P.V. SCHOOL CLOSURES REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District will hold a public hearing 
Monday to discuss a draft environmental impact report on school closures 
districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was requested by the consultant hired by a parents group that 
challenged the school board's 1987 decision to close Miraleste High School 
because of declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The board later rescinded its action. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the district to prepare the report 
after the parents group filed suit to keep Miraleste open. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing will begin at 7:30 p.m. at district headquarters. Additional 
hearings in September at the Rolling Hills High School gymnasium will focus on 
a completed version of the report. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council voted to send a letter to the 
school district criticizing the draft report. City officials say the draft does 
not adequately address transportation and economic issues.

GOVERNOR EXPLAINS VETO OF LOAN MEASURE

Gov. George Deukmejian acknowledged Thursday that he may have been misinformed 
when he allowed the state to risk $15 million in general fund money on an 
unsecured loan toward construction of an Olympic training center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said at a news conference that he was assured by the San Diego 
foundation receiving the money that it would fully secure the loan as part of 
its contract with the state -- an agreement the governor said was still being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian acknowledged that he may have been under a false impression 
after reporters pointed out that the contract already had been signed in June 
and that it had allowed for a risky unsecured loan. A state official told The 
Times after the contract was made public that it was "unusual" and could lead 
to the state losing its money if the foundation folded or walked away from the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the information that I had," said Deukmejian. "My information is 
that a contract has not yet been signed. . . . I don't have the right 
information. If that's in fact true, I would like to see that contract." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's comments came when he tried to explain why he had vetoed special 
legislation, contained in last week's budget bill, requiring collateral for the 
loan to the San Diego National Sports Training Foundation. The group broke 
ground this summer on what it hopes to be a state-of-the-art, $60-million 
all-weather complex to train Olympic athletes in a private development in the 
San Diego suburb of Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was mandated under a law passed last year but signed by Deukmejian 
only after he made the foundation promise it would be responsible for the loan 
if a plan to pay back the money through specialized license plate sales fell 
flat. The loan is to be made over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that direction, the Department of Commerce negotiated a contract that 
required no collateral and called on the foundation to pay only simple interest 
on the loan -- facts that drew loud criticism from legislators this summer. 
Branding it a risky venture, the lawmakers put in the special language 
requiring security and the payment in compounded interest.

O.C. COMMISSIONER'S VOTES APPEAR TO BREAK STATE LAW; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: PLANNING OFFICIAL ACTED ON MISSION VIEJO CO. MATTERS AFTER 
ACCEPTING $365 IN GIFTS FROM THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County planning commissioner may have violated California's 
conflict-of-interest law by voting on matters affecting a major development 
company within one year after he accepted $365 worth of free golfing 
privileges, meals and theater and sports tickets from the firm, records show. 
</P>
<P>
County documents reviewed by The Times show that Planning Commissioner C. 
Douglas Leavenworth voted eight times in 1988 on land-use matters affecting the 
development plans of the Mission Viejo Co., the firm that designed and built 
what is now the city of Mission Viejo and nearby Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth's votes, all favoring positions urged by the Mission Viejo Co., 
followed his acceptance in 1987 of the gifts from the firm. Leavenworth valued 
those gifts at $365 on an annual financial-disclosure statement he filed with 
the county and the California Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits elected or appointed officials "at any level of state or 
local government" from participating in decisions that "will have a material 
financial effect" on any individual or company from which the official has 
received gifts worth $250 or more within the preceding 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, confirmed that any officeholder violating the $250 gift provision 
could face maximum fines of $2,000 per violation, imposed by the FPPC, or 
misdemeanor charges prosecuted by the county district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to officials who accept $250 or more of gifts, Michioku said, "They 
must avoid participating in a governmental decision, if it is likely to affect 
the financial interest" of the donor. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth, who was appointed by then-Supervisor Ralph Clark in 1982 and 
reappointed by Supervisor Don R. Roth, said in an interview that he has 
violated no law and has "absolutely not" been influenced by the gifts from the 
Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one iota," Leavenworth said. ". . . It's really an insult to suggest that 
people are buying our influence by providing us lunch, for Christ's sake. . . . 
We're private citizens trying to do our best for the county under very 
difficult circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County planning commissioners are paid $170 for every meeting they 
attend. If the commissioners attended the minimum number of meetings held each 
year, 84, they would be paid $14,280, according to the commission's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Planning Commission holds wide power over whether, or how land 
may be developed in unincorporated areas of Orange County. The commission, for 
instance, can approve or deny land-use permits, variances and site plans that 
are crucial to developers who have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake. 
Decisions of the commission can be appealed to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth's votes in 1988 regarding the Mission Viejo Co. encompassed 
approvals of the company's proposed area plans and tentative tract maps, 
according to Planning Commission records. On April 12, 1988, for instance, 
Leavenworth and his colleagues voted unanimously to deny an appeal of a Mission 
Viejo Co. tract map for the Aliso Viejo Planned Community. The appeal had been 
lodged by The Laguna Greenbelt Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Records also show that over six years, from 1984 through 1989, Leavenworth has 
reported receiving $1,207 worth of gifts from the Mission Viejo Co. During that 
same period, Leavenworth reported that eight other development-related firms 
gave him gifts worth a total of $1,470. 
</P>
<P>
Other planning commissioners have reported receiving gifts from developers. But 
none, other than Leavenworth, received more than $250 worth of gifts a year 
from any single company, according to the records. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth answered questions over the telephone from his home in Anaheim but 
declined to grant an interview in person. The commissioner said that he does 
not know of any law that prevented him from voting on matters after he had 
accepted gifts of any value. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth declined a reporter's invitation to show him, in writing, the state 
conflict-of-interest law. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibition is contained in the Political Reform Act, the post-Watergate 
reform that was enacted overwhelmingly by California voters in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth instead pointed out that Orange County's so-called TIN CUP 
ordinance does not apply to him because, as an appointed official, he does not 
accept campaign contributions. The county ordinance was designed to prevent 
county supervisors from participating in decisions affecting development 
companies that give more than $1,808 to the politician's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Andrus, a deputy Orange County counsel, confirmed that the TIN CUP 
ordinance does not apply to members of the Planning Commission. Andrus also 
said that the commissioners are subject to the $250 gift ceiling contained in 
the state's conflict-of-interest law. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth, asked about the eight meals that he reported as gifts from the 
Mission Viejo Co. in 1987, said those sessions increased his knowledge of the 
matters that he was to vote on. Leavenworth said the meals provided good, 
low-key opportunities to ask questions of company executives about a project. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a couple hours out of your time," said Leavenworth, a retired 
aerospace engineer. "And it usually is a very comfortable way to have a 
one-on-one discussion. . . . In any case that comes before us, the person that 
knows the most about it is the applicant." 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth also said that he has not been influenced by the $125 worth of free 
golfing privileges provided during that year by the Mission Viejo Co. In fact, 
Leavenworth said that he has extended a "standing invitation" to David A. 
Celestin, the Mission Viejo Co.'s executive vice president for planning and 
governmental affairs, to be part of the commissioner's golfing foursome on 
Saturday mornings at the Willowick course in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We're brought into contact and we enjoy the same things," Leavenworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Celestin did not return calls seeking comment. Wendy Wetzel, spokeswoman for 
the Mission Viejo Co., said that the company provides gifts to members of the 
county Planning Commission and an array of other business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"We do business with the Planning Commission," Wetzel said. "They're our 
business associates." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the theater-related gifts he received from the Mission Viejo Co., 
Leavenworth said they were, in part, the result of the cultural focus of the 
firm and its corporate parent, the Philip Morris Cos. Leavenworth said the 
theater-related gifts he reported from the Mission Viejo Co. involved 
performances of the Joffrey Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great thing that Philip Morris is doing," Leavenworth said. 
"We're happy to support the ballet, in effect, by going." 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC's Michioku said that any official who reaches the $250 gift limit 
should abstain for 12 months from decision-making that effects the donor of the 
gifts. In other words, if Leavenworth's gifts from the Mission Viejo totaled 
$250 as of October, 1987, he should have abstained on matters affecting the 
company until October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear from reading Leavenworth's financial-disclosure statement 
precisely when he reached the $250 limit. But the records indicate he reached 
that point in either November or December of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The precise date would be important to calculating exactly how many times 
Leavenworth's votes affecting Mission Viejo Co. occurred after he reached the 
$250 state limit. County Planning Commission records show that he voted eight 
times on matters affecting the company in 1988 and 14 times in 1987. Two of the 
votes in December, 1987, were clearly after Leavenworth passed the $250 
threshold, because they occurred within days after his last reported gifts from 
the company that year. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission records show that, of the 22 occasions during 1987-1988 
that Leavenworth voted on matters affecting the Mission Viejo Co., each time he 
took the position sought by company representatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEAVENWORTH'S VOTES AFFECTING MISSION VIEJO CO. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner C. Douglas Leavenworth participated in 22 votes in 1987 
and 1988 that affected the Mission Viejo Co. In 1987, Leavenworth reported 
receiving $365 in gifts from the firm. State law requires officials who have 
received $250 or more over a 12-month period to abstain from voting on matters

In a first step to reduce human impact on Yosemite Valley, the National Park 
Service is planning to tear down a score of maintenance buildings and construct 
new ones in El Portal at the park's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service Director James Ridenour said $16 million to make the move 
is budgeted for 1992. Under a master plan developed for the park, most motor 
vehicle traffic would eventually be barred from the valley. Shuttle buses would 
carry more than 3 million visitors a year to and from the 7-mile-long, 
1-mile-wide area.

SPIKES IN 3 TREE LOGS DISCOVERED

<TEXT>
<P>
Seven 10-inch spikes were found in three Douglas fir logs prepared for sawing 
at Louisiana-Pacific's mill in Samoa, the lumber company reported. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fortunate nobody was hurt," the firm's division manager, Joe Wheeler, 
said. The spikes were discovered on Aug. 2. It was the first reported incident 
of tree "spiking" in about two years. The tactic -- favored by opponents of 
old-growth logging -- has been renounced by sponsors of Redwood Summer, Earth 
First! Wheeler called on leaders of the groups to again disavow spiking to 
prevent injuries to workers.

State agriculture officials said they will confiscate all table grapes grown on 
seven acres of a Delano ranch on grounds that they were sprayed illegally for 
the second consecutive year. During a recent Department of Food and Agriculture 
hearing, Sandrini Bros. growers contended that there was a laboratory error or 
a vendetta by the department's staff. 
</P>
<P>
However, a hearing officer found in favor of the department's proposal to 
confiscate the fruit, spokeswoman Veda Federighi said. Department Director 
Henry Voss upheld the hearing officer's decision. There was no immediate word 
whether Sandrini Bros. will appeal to Kern County Superior Court. The state 
contends that tests showed traces on Sandrini's grapes of a growth regulator 
called Fix, technically known as 4-CPA, which is registered only for tomatoes, 
Federighi said. Sandrini also was charged with using Fix last year, she said.

<P>
Trading a futures market is a matter of carefully interpreting ambiguous signs, 
and the signs seemed plenty obscure Thursday as they flashed on the screens of 
Dean Witter Reynolds' New York energy futures desk. 
</P>
<P>
Iran warns that it won't tolerate Kuwait's annexation, read one headline. 
Turkey has moved F-16 fighter planes to its frontier, said another. 
</P>
<P>
"Intermittent movement of Iraqis toward Saudi border," broker Randall 
Rothenberg recited from a screen as he tried to simultaneously hold three 
telephone receivers. "What's that mean?" 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing the tango?" proposed broker Stephanie Rzasa. 
</P>
<P>
Such headlines have taken on unusual significance in the past week, since 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices into orbit and focused the world's 
attention on the gyrating oil futures market of New York. Indeed, the market 
centered at the New York Mercantile Exchange is the world hub of oil futures 
trading. It has been where America has looked to discover that crude oil prices 
had leaped as much as one-third. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the exchange has set records twice in the past five days and, though 
Thursday was quieter, some traders believe that the market may churn and heave 
again if the unpredictable Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, decides to resist 
growing military pressure around him. Historically, oil futures have been twice 
as volatile as financial futures such as bonds and stock-index futures and, in 
the past week, they've demonstrated that volatility again. 
</P>
<P>
All of this makes the game of betting on prices more interesting than usual for 
traders and brokers, such as Rothenberg, who work at New York's more than 
two-dozen energy futures desks. "As prices get up into the stratosphere, you've 
really got little to go on," said Rothenberg, who is 34. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-broker Dean Witter desk is in Manhattan's twin-towered World Trade 
Center -- only two buildings away from the chaotic Nymex trading pits where 
floor brokers and traders swap contracts, which are pledges to buy and sell 
specified amounts of oil at a designated date. Brokers such as Rothenberg take 
orders from such customers as oil companies, banks, petroleum wholesalers, oil 
producers and even airlines, and call them to floor brokers for execution of 
the trades. 
</P>
<P>
The trading desk is dense with phones, computer hardware and screens flashing 
fast-changing prices and news dispatches. On the walls are large maps showing 
the location of refineries and oil and gas lines in the United States and the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
While the brokers aren't betting the firm's own money by buying contracts, 
customers are relying on them for their judgment on the market's direction. 
</P>
<P>
At the regular staff meeting that preceded the market's 9:45 a.m. opening, the 
Dean Witter group decided that the recent decline in prices might soon be 
reversed. Through the morning, the brokers got that word out to customers. 
</P>
<P>
With tanks, aircraft and a flotilla of ships moving toward him, Hussein "is 
going to be like a caged tiger," Rothenberg told one. "He's not going to turn 
on his heel and go quietly home. . . . He may be getting his claws ready." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any military move by the strongman that threatened Saudi oil fields 
would reignite price increases. 
</P>
<P>
The brokers judge the market's course using information from any number of 
sources. They try to gauge the sentiment of the market by talking to their 
customers and floor brokers, by evaluating the meaning of the orders they have 
received and sometimes by simply listening to the level of background noise 
when they call the trading pit. 
</P>
<P>
They pay close heed to any news on oil supply, such as Thursday's bulletin that 
UltraMar Inc. was closing its catalytic "cracker" refining hardware in 
Wilmington, Calif., unexpectedly for repair. The computer screens arrayed on 
the desks also provide charts and graphs illustrating so-called technical 
factors -- the internal market dynamics that are supposed to also influence 
which way prices will go. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, some traders rely on hunches. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the pace of the business, brokers must sometimes depend on the 
single-line news headlines that appear on their Telerate information service 
screens beneath densely plotted charts of petroleum prices. But a one-line 
headline can't often convey enough about a complicated situation, and sometimes 
the market misreads the summaries and moves forcefully in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, one such headline reported: "Soviets will not join U.S.-led 
forces," which might suggest that the Soviets were distancing themselves from 
the embargo effort -- a circumstance that might raise prices. But the remainder 
of the report, which didn't appear on the screen, said the Soviets were 
apparently willing to take part in a U.N.-led effort. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices added more than 30 cents a barrel for a while Thursday morning 
on the strength of a report attributed to the British government that Iraq had 
closed its borders. But some people wondered later if this marked a change. 
</P>
<P>
"The borders were already closed," said Lisa Morgan McNaney, who supervises 
floor brokers for United Fuels, a New York futures firm. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, too, traders try to purposely feed in misleading information to get 
things moving their way. On Thursday, a caller asked Dean Witter broker Sandra 
Weinberger: "Have you heard about anything being shot down?" 
</P>
<P>
There may have been some grain of truth to the suggestion, or maybe the caller 
had bought contracts at a high price and was desperate to inject some anxiety 
that would move the market. "You always assume there's something behind it," 
said Weinberger. 
</P>
<P>
The broker's job is not only to make money for the customers but also to 
provide services that keep them happy in other ways. Sometimes the brokers go 
to some length. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dean Witter's customers is a French concern that regularly calls from a 
speaker phone and remains on the line for many hours. The purpose is to be sure 
that the customer has an open phone with a good connection if it decides to 
place orders. 
</P>
<P>
The brokers can't put the phone down, so they take turns cradling the silent 
receiver. Once, Rothenberg sang the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, 
in an effort to get the customer's attention. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
Many customers are calling from overseas to get in on the action in New York, 
and Rothenberg talks regularly to clients in Chile, Spain, England, France and 
Japan. He speaks French and German, which he said helps. 
</P>
<P>
The job doesn't demand the physical stamina required by working in the pits, 
but most brokers on such desks are between 25 and 40 years old. After 40, they 
go into administration, move on to jobs such as consulting or change careers 
completely, brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
Most brokers probably earn between $50,000 and $150,000 a year, Rothenberg 
estimated. Only a few earn $250,000 or more a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the front of Rothenberg's phone is taped a printed fortune-cookie slip: 
"You will be unusually successful in business." 
</P>
<P>
The job's worst nightmare, brokers say, is a mistake in executing a trade. If a 
client calls in a "sell" order on a day when dozens of others are buying, it's 
easy to mistakenly reverse the order. Then the house may need to eat the loss. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of money is at stake. Prices have fluctuated by more than $2 a barrel in 
several recent sessions. A move of only 25 cents adds or subtracts $25,000 from 
the value of the 100-contract orders that are regularly called in. 
</P>
<P>
One of the thrills of the job is calling a turn in prices and making the 
customer a lot of money. "It's an instant gratification sort of thing with this 
job," said Rothenberg, who grew up in New York and abroad and said he was drawn 
to the business by the fast pace. "I could have been a bank credit officer, but 
I wanted something a little quicker."

Peru Takes Drastic Economic Turn: Newly inaugurated President Alberto Fujimori, 
facing a devastated economy, inaugurated an economic austerity program that 
freed the monetary exchange rate, lifted price controls and raised the price of 
gasoline by nearly 3,000% to equal $1.12 a gallon. The government attempted to 
soften the blow to consumers by ordering wages increased 100% to a maximum of 
$125 a month.

OAKLAND DELIGHTED BY REOPENING OF EMPORIUM; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE STORE, FINALLY RESTORED AFTER BEING DAMAGED IN LAST YEAR'S 
QUAKE, WAS THE BIG LURE FOR SHOPPERS TO THE CITY'S STRUGGLING DOWNTOWN.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Aug. 5, 1929, a crowd of 10,000 people gathered in downtown Oakland for the 
long-awaited opening of the H. C. Capwell department store in a massive, 
brick-fronted building adorned with terra cotta and hailed as a gem of Beaux 
Arts design. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the six-floor store, renamed the Emporium a year ago but still Capwell 
to many longtime Oaklanders, will reopen after almost 10 months of massive 
restoration to repair damage from last October's Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the city's anticipation is great, even if far fewer than 10,000 
well-wishers are expected this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"The reopening of the Emporium is wonderful," said Allen Michaan, a 
preservation-minded entrepreneur who has saved many movie palaces, including 
Oakland's Grand Lake Theater. "The city needs it. And I need some new pants." 
</P>
<P>
For Oakland's struggling downtown, it would seem that the rebirth of its 
largest department store is almost as significant as the original christening. 
</P>
<P>
With the main magnet for shoppers out of commission, many small merchants that 
depended on foot traffic have seen their business slashed in half since Oct. 
17. And beleaguered Oakland has suffered the loss of needed sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
A few stores, in fact, couldn't hold on and now sit boarded up and empty on the 
stretch of Broadway south of the Emporium, bringing a sense of blight to an 
already troubled area. 
</P>
<P>
"Since October, Broadway has been quite dead," said Angela Blackwell, president 
of the Urban Strategies Council, an anti-poverty organization in Oakland. 
Blackwell, who missed the Emporium particularly during the holidays, has been 
doing her shopping in San Francisco and San Leandro, just south of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Sargent, the chic, 81-year-old owner of a boutique that bears her name 
south of the Emporium, said business since the day after the quake "has been 
awful," off as much as 50%. During the post-quake period, Sargent has often 
called an old friend, Jack Richardson, chairman of the Emporium, to urge him to 
"open that damn store." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help Oakland merchants any that the earthquake occurred as retailing 
in general was heading into a slump. As a result, retailers have found it 
difficult to assess how much of their sales decline can be attributed simply to 
the loss of foot traffic from the Emporium. But all are eager for the doors to 
open again. 
</P>
<P>
"Having them up and running will be a great benefit," said Marc Riskin, whose 
family owns a jewelry store across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Riskin said many shoppers will undoubtedly miss the brick facade and fancy 
terra cotta details. City officials ordered them stripped off after the 
earthquake in the name of seismic safety. 
</P>
<P>
The Emporium replaced them with concrete sprayed on to form "a skin," said Carl 
Stein, construction manager for Carter Hawley Hale Stores, the Los 
Angeles-based owner of the Emporium chain. The exterior has been painted a 
pinkish-sand color. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, workers removed a mezzanine level that largely collapsed in the 
15-second temblor, reinforced interior walls, replaced fallen stairways and 
improved the sprinkler system. All told, according to estimates used by the 
city, the repairs cost $10 million, most of which was covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley Hale also had "business interruption" insurance that covered the 
loss of some sales, cushioning the blow to the 22-store Emporium chain and its 
parent, which nonetheless reported losses it attributed in large part to the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
According to retailing analysts, the 350-employee Oakland store accounts for 
$40 million of the Emporium's $750 million in annual sales and is the chain's 
second-largest producer, after the downtown San Francisco store. 
</P>
<P>
One Oakland institution eager for the reopening is the Tribune, the city's 
cash-strapped daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in downtown Oakland since the quake has reduced their ad linage in 
this newspaper," said Robert C. Maynard, the Tribune's publisher and majority 
owner. Shrinking advertising revenue, on top of competition from other East Bay 
newspapers, forced the paper recently to lay off more than 120 staff members 
and take other cost-saving steps. 
</P>
<P>
The paper is getting a boost from several pages of special advertising by the 
Emporium to trumpet the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Brown, director of the Office of Economic Development and Employment in 
Oakland, estimates that the city will have lost $500,000 in sales tax revenue 
by the time the first anniversary of the quake rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
Brown noted that the Emporium at least had its corporate owner's deep pockets 
and insurance coverage. Many smaller merchants had no insurance, and about 20 
buildings downtown remain closed because their owners cannot afford to fix 
quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake also further delayed progress on a long-planned downtown mall 
that Rouse Co. hopes to develop. The Emporium would be a cornerstone for a 
retail center that would include such tenants as Macy's, J. C. Penney and, 
possibly, Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
The project is something that city officials view as vital for any downtown 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Oaklanders recognize that the Emporium cannot solve downtown's 
problems single-handedly. But the reopening is a start. 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating an oft-voiced sentiment, Maynard said: "We're hoping this is the 
harbinger for better times in downtown Oakland."

Retail Sales Rise in July: Most of the nation's big retailers reported modest 
July sales gains, but analysts said the upcoming back-to-school and fall season 
would better reflect how consumers are reacting to rising oil prices and a 
weakening economy. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's third-largest retailer, 
posted a 21% sales gain in July, to $2.4 billion from $1.98 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The weakest results were seen at general merchandise retailers such as Sears, 
Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's biggest retailer, and K mart Corp., said Janet 
Mangano, an analyst at Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. The Sears merchandise Group 
said July sales from continuing operations rose 3.7% to $2.52 billion, from 
$2.43 billion a year ago.

Government-Held Thrifts Lose $3.1 Billion: The first-quarter loss by savings 
and loans controlled by the government compared to a deficit of $6.4 billion in 
the previous quarter, the Resolution Trust Corp. said. The 350 thrifts under 
the government's conservatorship program reported operating losses of $1.4

Federal banking regulators came under sharp criticism in Congress on Thursday 
for allowing banks to make too many risky loans to high-flying borrowers such 
as Donald J. Trump while squeezing small businesses out of the credit market. 
</P>
<P>
At a House Banking Committee hearing, lawmakers expressed concern that a 
growing proportion of commercial bank assets are either not earning money or 
are invested in questionable real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism reflects increasing concern that the same factors responsible for 
the collapse of the savings and loan industry could cause similar problems for 
the nation's commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) criticized federal 
regulators for not being frank about current practices.

3 CHARGED IN $3.8-MILLION INSIDER TRADING SCHEME

<P>
A former Smith Barney broker, a former lawyer from a prestigious corporate law 
firm and the broker's sister have been charged with participating in a 
$3.8-million insider trading scheme, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Eben Smith, 41, of Greenwich, Conn., a former broker in the Stamford, Conn., 
office of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., was indicted by a federal grand 
jury on 10 counts relating to insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Glauberman, 39, of Manhattan, a former associate of the Skadden, Arps, 
Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom law firm, was named in a 10-count criminal 
information filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
The filing of a criminal information means that a defendant has waived the 
right to an indictment and often indicates that a plea agreement is being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, both men face a maximum sentence of five years in prison. They 
also face a $250,000 fine on each count -- or a fine amounting to twice the 
gross profits made through the alleged scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington announced that 
Glauberman settled related civil insider trading charges without admitting or 
denying guilt. 
</P>
<P>
His sister, Lori Glauberman, a former junior associate in the fixed-income 
department at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., also settled civil insider charges 
involving trading in her own account on inside tips. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, Steven Glauberman will repay $221,000 and his sister 
$19,000 in illegal profit. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Steven Glauberman, who worked in the merger and 
acquisitions area, sold information to Smith about his law firm's clients who 
were involved in takeover situations.

KEATING, EX-THRIFT KINGPIN, STANDS WEALTHY UNTIL HE'S PROVEN PENNILESS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: REGULATORS REFUSE TO BELIEVE THE FORMER EXECUTIVE IS BROKE. YET HIS 
HOUSE IS FOR SALE AND HE'S LOOKING FOR WORK.

<P>
In 1987, Charles H. Keating Jr. had a net worth of about $39 million. Today he 
claims that he is a pauper. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators are incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
So the Office of Thrift Supervision filed administrative charges Thursday 
seeking $40.9 million in restitution from Keating and five executives at 
American Continental Corp., the company that once owned the failed Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan. They also want Keating, who gave up his salary last fall as 
American Continental's chairman, to produce in five days a detailed accounting 
of his own assets. 
</P>
<P>
"There was just too much money available to him and too short a time for it to 
disappear," said T. Timothy Ryan, OTS director. "We believe Mr. Keating and his 
associates profited from the improper use of depositors' funds, and we want 
that money returned to Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
Regulators have claimed that Keating and his family took $34 million in 
salaries, stock options, stock sales and other benefits out of Irvine-based 
Lincoln in the five years they owned it. 
</P>
<P>
Despite appearances, the well-dressed and tanned Keating insists that he is 
flat broke; his debts equal or surpass his assets, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has practically lived out of suitcases this year. He has flown often to 
Washington to appear on television, shown up at industry conventions and 
visited editorial boards of the nation's major newspapers to explain his side 
of the April, 1989, failure of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
He recently signed a so-called forebearance agreement with creditors and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits at banks and thrifts. 
Under the agreement, he promises not to file for personal bankruptcy and they 
promise to give him more time to pay off debts, said Bradley J. Boland, a 
company spokesman and one of Keating's sons-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's $5-million house -- at least, that's the amount of mortgages on it -- 
is scheduled for a foreclosure sale next week and probably won't sell for 
anywhere near that amount in Phoenix's depressed real estate market. Keating is 
trying to come up with money to pay off the loan amount due, Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, he borrowed $690 to put an advertisement in the Arizona 
Republic saying he is now in business to "remodel, repair or custom-build your 
residential or commercial property." 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, he auditioned before the International Platform Assn. in an 
effort to win a spot on the sometimes high-paying lecture circuit. His topic, 
of course, would be the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of requests that he start speaking for fees," Boland said. 
"It's certainly a good way for us to start generating some income for him, and 
we've got to start generating some income." 
</P>
<P>
Boland said the trips often are paid for by media groups or others, or by the 
bankrupt American Continental, which is pursuing lawsuits in Washington and has 
business elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who is also an attorney, additionally has been talking about 
practicing law again, but has found little time to start such a venture, Boland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is no secret to anybody," he said. "And the worst part is that we 
haven't done anything wrong, and we have to live in this reign of regulatory 
terror." 
</P>
<P>
Last December, American Continental bondholders tried to freeze Keating's 
assets both here and abroad. But Keating swore that neither he nor anyone in 
his family has bank accounts or any other financial connection overseas. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers at that time, he said he sold his land and home in the Bahamas, 
which he bought in the 1970s before Phoenix-based American Continental bought 
Lincoln, and he pledged the proceeds from the sale to bank creditors. He also 
pledged land he owns in Canada and Flagstaff, Ariz., to the banks. 
</P>
<P>
His net worth, as high as $39 million in 1987, had fallen to $7.8 million at 
the end of July, 1989, according to court papers. But included in that figure 
is about $1.35 million in American Continental stock, which is close to 
worthless now, and $6 million in loans that Keating had given to his children 
in the late 1970s to buy American Continental stock. Those loans, due in 2002, 
are largely uncollectible, Keating said in the court document. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's protestations notwithstanding, regulators and bondholders' lawyers 
contend that he has funds stashed away somewhere.

Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc., a major Japanese chemical maker, said it will 
establish an equally owned venture with Shell International Chemical Co. of 
Britain to make polyurethane resin raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based company said a production base will be established in Spain, 
Italy or France. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies are scheduled to complete a joint feasibility study in the 
three countries by the end of this year and the site of a plant will be chosen 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui said plans call for building a factory that would have annual production 
capacity of 50,000 tons of diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI), raw materials 
for polyurethane resin. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for MDI is growing sharply because of its widespread application in 
areas including household electric appliances and automotive parts, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
World MDI production was estimated at 1.3 million tons last year, the company 
said.

TOWN IS IN DANGER OF LOSING ITS CHARM

COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holding on to the past, as one might endeavor to preserve a childhood memory, 
is commendable but impossible. Downtown Cooperstown, a village with one traffic 
light and flower boxes attached to the windowsills of gracious Victorian 
houses, fronted by impeccable lawns, has undergone sudden change. 
</P>
<P>
It's going "carni." Coney Island has taken over. Commercialism rears its 
insatiable head and Main Street, which once offered old-fashioned store fronts, 
is in danger of heading for ruin. The warning signs are up. 
</P>
<P>
How much longer will the charm of Cooperstown remain? It's here where we're 
told Abner Doubleday and barefooted farm boys played the first game of baseball 
and, even if it is a historical lie, as some researchers have suggested, the 
setting is ideal for accepting the fiction as some kind of poetic license for 
stretching the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperstown, as the cradle of baseball, might be mythical but is truly symbolic 
of a time 151 years ago when the grand American game was born. A visit to where 
baseball began is something of a spiritual experience. You are put in the 
proper frame as you walk the tree-shaded streets and view this special quality 
and pace of life. 
</P>
<P>
But none of what has transpired of late around town is for the best. It can't 
be defined as beneficial when Cooperstown is showing signs of losing its 
character. Aesthetically, it has been rocked on its heels. There's shock. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists and the "townies" agree. They don't like it. Can something be done to 
put the brakes on the erosion of a memorable setting that author James Fenimore 
Cooper brought to the literary attention of the world in using these green 
hills and crystal waters as the backdrop for his wondrous adventures? 
</P>
<P>
The natives are particularly upset. At last count, nine stores selling baseball 
cards, a modern phenomenon, are open for business. Some establishments erect 
tables on the sidewalk to showcase their wares, selling all types of souvenirs 
such as T-shirts, pictures, bats, caps and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Landers, who operates the Short Stop Restaurant, which was founded by 
her grandfather, Salvatore Sapienza, in 1921 and given its present name in 
1939, the year the Hall of Fame opened, shook her head in dismay and said, 
"Cooperstown is getting too big for itself. We might have to put a stop to it. 
The trend is upsetting to all of us who truly care about Cooperstown." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Baltimore Orioles' sales department, Lucy Kelly, recognizes 
what is taking place but insists Cooperstown retains an appeal all its own. "I 
still find it a quaint little town," she said. "The Hall of Fame draws me and, 
of course, the striking beauty of the countryside." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Klein of Baltimore has been coming here every summer since 1977 to 
enjoy the tranquility and the history that abounds. Asked for a comparison, 
covering two decades, he answered, "It used to be an original. Now it's getting 
like any other city. But I plan to keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Closer to the heart of the village is Marge Strait, who owns the Cooperstown 
Diner. She insists the "whole town is upset." Can anything be done? "The town 
trustees held a meeting to discuss it. But you can't lock the gate after the 
horse is out. Most of the change has happened in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do something. It's getting trashy looking. Four new card shops have 
opened. How do you keep them out? The baseball memorabilia places, some of 
which pay the Hall of Fame players money for signing autographs, set up tables 
on the street and even erected tents on their property. It's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Cooperstown has a fight on its hands to recover the identity and protect the 
indigenous characteristics that made it so distinctive. It'll survive, no 
doubt, but, hopefully, the scars that have been inflicted will be repaired.

In one of the more interesting pairings of the week, Payne Stewart found 
himself seated next to President Pat Rielly of the PGA of America at Wednesday 
evening's Dinner of PGA Champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Saw your comments," said Rielly of Stewart's pretournament bashing of the 
Shoal Creek Country Club's Bermuda grass rough. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the defending PGA champion, nodded. 
</P>
<P>
"You're entitled to that opinion," Rielly said. "But I'm not going to cut it." 
</P>
<P>
And he didn't. No one did. The result was a tournament light on red numbers and 
heavy on complaints as only 15 in the 152-player field finished the first round 
of Thursday's PGA Championship under par.

Leader Bobby Wadkins shot a 68, four under, in a round that featured eight 
birdies and almost that many criticisms of Shoal Creek's shot-swallowing rough. 
</P>
<P>
"You're just hoping to see the golf ball, much less hit it," said Wadkins, who 
called the rough the worst he has seen during his 16 winless years on the tour. 
"Someone told me they found a Rolex out there. You're liable to find anything." 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins said he was tempted to bring his 6-month-old son to the course, put him 
in the rough and see if the child could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what (the PGA) was trying to prove by that," he said. "There's no 
skill about going in there with a sand wedge, acting like Hulk Hogan and 
hitting the hell out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Even Fred Couples, who hit every fairway Thursday on his way to a 69 and a tie 
with Mark O'Meara for second place, knew the harsh reality of errant drives. 
</P>
<P>
"When you stand on the tee, you know if you don't hit the cut grass, you have 
no chance at all," Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange and Tom Kite didn't hit enough fairways and look what happened 
to them. They finished with matching 79s. Jack Nicklaus had a 78. Greg Norman, 
with his customary poor first round, Lee Trevino, who won at Shoal Creek in 
1984, and U.S. Open champion Hale Irwin stalked away with 77s. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone struggled. Billy Mayfair, who won the 1987 U.S. Amateur, 
managed a 70, as did Scott Verplank, the only player to reach five under during 
his round before fading on the final four holes. 
</P>
<P>
Verplank was in sole possession of the lead when he reached the par-five, 
530-yard 17th hole. His drive, he said, "was probably 10,000 trees to the right 
of the fairway." Four shots later, after spending more time in the pines than 
some wild animals, Verplank got back on the fairway. Two shots later he had his 
double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Verplank, a diabetic who was hospitalized earlier in the year, said he got 
tired late in his round as his sugar level decreased. To combat it, he ate 
fruits or peanut butter crackers or sandwiches every three holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a small grocery store in my bag," he said. "Guys come up and ask me 
for something to eat." 
</P>
<P>
But Verplank found the demands of a major championship too much to overcome. 
"There's more stress and strain when you tee it up in a major," he said. 
"That's probably the main reason I struggled coming in." 
</P>
<P>
The most vocal critic of Shoal Creek's rough, Stewart, also faltered slightly 
at round's end. He bogeyed No. 17 and finished three strokes behind Wadkins. 
Despite the sub-par round, Stewart refused to give up his fight against 
Rielly's overgrown Bermuda grass. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it was 3 1/2 inches," Stewart said of the rough. "I'd like him to take 
a ruler out there and measure it." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is tied with nine others at one under, among them Mike Reid, who led 
last year's PGA until the 70th hole, when he recorded a bogey, followed by a 
double bogey and a par. 
</P>
<P>
Though in a position to challenge again, Reid said he would rather not think 
about the well-documented collapse. Someone then mentioned that he had made 
many friends with his handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather win the tournament and make less friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
PGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the 12 "non-Americans" invited to the PGA Championship, Britain's 
Nick Faldo couldn't help but use the opportunity as a chance to criticize the 
PGA of America's player-selection process. "I'm still very disappointed that 
they don't invite the (European Ryder Cup) team, our team," he said. "They 
invited the U.S. team. They should have more international players here this 
week." Faldo then was asked if the U.S. Ryder Cup team is invited to play the 
European PGA Championship. "Ah, touche," said Faldo, smiling. "But it's not a 
major, though -- thank God." Faldo, trying for his third major title of the 
year, was in contention with a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Green was disqualified after missing his 8:46 a.m. tee time. Instead of 
consulting the official pairings sheet, Green read Wednesday's edition of USA 
Today, not realizing that the newspaper's starting times were given in Eastern 
Daylight Time. Birmingham is in the Central time zone, meaning that Green was 
an hour late. Green, who was replaced by Jay Delsing, wasn't the only casualty 
of the threesome. Bill Glasson withdrew after nine holes because of back 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer, the only player with a lifetime exemption for the tournament, 
was two under after three holes and still finished with an 81. His round 
included four bogeys, a double bogey and and two triple bogeys. . . . Lanny 
Wadkins, leader Bobby Wadkins' older brother, wasn't too far back. He shot a 
74.

RED SOX MAKE IT EASY FOR CLEMENS; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: BOSTON POUNDS OUT 17 HITS AS ERA LEADER WINS HIS 16TH GAME, 14-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In scoring two earned runs off Roger Clemens, the Angels accomplished just 
about what most teams have done against the Boston right-hander this season. In 
losing to him, they also kept up the trend. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, who had allowed only one earned run in his previous three games, was 
charged with two runs Thursday, but that did little to jeopardize either his 
bid for the American League earned-run average title or the Red Sox's bid to 
increase their AL East lead to two games over Toronto. Clemens lasted 6 2/3 
innings and left behind three runners -- two of whom scored -- but his 
teammates' offensive support secured a 14-3 rout of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Although his ERA rose .02 to 2.16, Clemens (16-5) struck out six to increase 
his league-leading strikeout total to 164. He is second in wins to Oakland's 
Bob Welch, who has 18. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greenwell drove in three runs with a two-run home run -- the first off Jim 
Abbott by a left-handed hitter this season -- and a sacrifice fly. Ellis Burks 
also drove in three to lead Boston's 17-hit attack against Abbott (7-10), Mark 
Eichhorn and Cliff Young and give the Red Sox their eighth victory in 10 games. 
Abbott allowed seven earned runs in six innings and has yet to win back-to-back 
decisions this season. He is 1-6 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Reed, Carlos Quintana and Wade Boggs, the first, second and third hitters 
in Boston's lineup, ranked fifth, sixth and seventh in the AL batting race 
before the game. All three improved their averages in the early innings 
Thursday, as the Red Sox scored three times in the first and three more in the 
third to take a commanding 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Quintana, who has hit in 15 of 16 games, singled up the middle with one 
out to begin the first-inning uprising. He went to second when Boggs singled to 
left, extending his hitting streak to 12 games. Quintana and Boggs scored when 
Burks, who took a .303 average into the game and was a few points out of the 
top 10, lined a triple into the right-field corner. Burks scored when Luis 
Polonia made a poor throw home on Greenwell's fly to shallow left. 
</P>
<P>
That lead ballooned to 6-0 in the third. Reed touched things off with a single 
to left. He took second on Quintana's single to center and went to third when 
Boggs forced Quintana at second. Burks followed with a grounder to third, which 
Rick Schu turned into a force on Boggs at second. Reed scored on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell followed with his sixth home run of the season, hitting Abbott's 
first pitch over the fence in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens limited the Angels to two hits over four innings, the first being a 
single to left by Chili Davis in Davis' first at-bat since being activated off 
the disabled list. Davis, who had a lower back strain, last played on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
Through five innings, Clemens had allowed three singles and had not permitted 
the Angels to get a runner into scoring position. He had recorded five 
strikeouts, getting Polonia twice and Lee Stevens, Dick Schofield and Max 
Venable once each, and had not issued a walk. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott had an easier time getting through the middle innings, holding Boston to 
one walk and one hit through the fourth, fifth and sixth. But the Angels were 
unable to make a dent in the Red Sox's big lead. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens showed some vulnerability in the sixth, when the Angels put runners on 
first and third with one out. Polonia led off with a grounder to deep short, so 
sure a hit that shortstop Tim Naehring didn't bother throwing. After a 
strikeout of Johnny Ray, Davis singled to left, moving Polonia to third. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who entered the game with a .368 career average against Clemens, 
flied to right, but the ball was too shallow for Polonia to risk tagging and 
trying to score. Stevens couldn't get a run in, either, lofting a fly ball 
caught on the run by Greenwell. 
</P>
<P>
After yielding a leadoff double to Tony Pena in the seventh, Abbott was 
relieved by Mark Eichhorn. Pena moved to third on a grounder by Reed and scored 
on Quintana's third hit of the night, a single to right. The Red Sox broke it 
open with five more in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Conditioning coach Jimmie Reese, who underwent two angioplasty procedures after 
experiencing heart problems earlier this season, continues to recover at his 
Westwood home. It was initially hoped that the 85-year-old Reese, renowned for 
his fungo hitting, would be back in uniform after the All-Star break but his 
doctors have cautioned him against that exertion. He might visit Anaheim 
Stadium next week as a spectator for the first time since his illness. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis was activated off the disabled list and was in Thursday's lineup. 
To make room on the roster, pitcher Joe Grahe was optioned to Triple A 
Edmonton. Davis was placed on the DL on July 17 (retroactive to July 14) 
because of a lower back strain. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing was scratched from Thursday's lineup shortly before the game 
because of a slightly strained right hamstring, an injury he suffered while 
running to first base in the 11th inning of the Angels' 8-6 victory over Boston 
Wednesday. Davis, who was originally to play left field, became the DH, Luis 
Polonia moved from center field to left and Max Venable was inserted in center 
field. . . . Bob McClure pronounced himself ready to pitch after throwing on 
consecutive days without pain or stiffness. During his recovery from elbow 
problems, he has added a forkball to his repertoire. "It's not like (Chuck) 
Finley's or (Bryan) Harvey's," he said. "Theirs drop. Mine is more like a 
screwball."

RUBIN LAUGHED ALL THE WAY TO BANK, HALL OF FAME; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: OWNER MAKES IT ON JOHN HENRY'S BACK. VELASQUEZ, MCANALLY, 
SHEPPARD ALSO INDUCTED.

SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Rubin, who wisecracked his way through the career of John Henry, a horse 
who earned $6.5 million after Rubin bought him for $25,000, hasn't retired as a 
stand-up comic. 
</P>
<P>
On an occasion that sometimes is solemn and tearful, Rubin and Dick Francis, 
the former British steeplechase jockey who became a best-selling mystery 
novelist, made levity the pattern of the day Thursday as four horses, two 
trainers and a jockey were admitted into racing's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The induction ceremony, held under a large tent next to the Hall of Fame and 
across the street from the Saratoga track, was attended by more than 1,000 
people, among them 34 enshrined trainers and jockeys invited back for the 
hall's 40th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, who lives in Florida and was visiting Saratoga for the first time, 
told jokes. Later, after John Forsythe presented John Henry's plaque to Rubin, 
the horse's owner laughed at himself for his lack of racing expertise both 
before and after he bought the horse. 
</P>
<P>
Also inducted were Ron McAnally, who has trained John Henry and about 90 other 
stakes-winning horses; Jonathan Sheppard, America's premier steeplechase 
trainer; and jockey Jorge Velasquez, who is still riding after winning more 
than 6,000 races. 
</P>
<P>
Besides John Henry, other horses inducted were All Along, the brilliant grass 
filly from France who won horse-of-the-year honors in the United States in 
1983; Bimelech, winner of the Preakness and Belmont Stakes in 1940; and Zaccio, 
the champion steeplechase horse in 1980-82. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, 75, is a New York bicycle importer and lifelong horseplayer who owned 
only a few insignificant horses until John Henry, a mean-spirited gelding who 
had already gone through seven owners, came along in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin recalled Thursday how he told his wife, Dorothy, that he was going to 
spend about $50,000 on a couple of so-so horses and have some fun. Rubin was 
quickly put in touch with Harold Snowden, the owner of John Henry, through a 
bloodstock agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave 10% of the sale price to the agent," Rubin said. "I didn't know that I 
wasn't supposed to pay the commission." 
</P>
<P>
John Henry was sent from Kentucky to New York for a physical inspection before 
the sale could be completed. 
</P>
<P>
" 'This horse is in at the knees (knock-kneed),' " Rubin said he was told by 
veterinarian Manny Gilman. 
</P>
<P>
" 'That's good,' " Rubin said he naively replied. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin first sent John Henry to trainer Bobby Donato, who looked at the horse 
and said to the owner: "This horse has a grass foot." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he didn't know what that meant, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked down at the ground and didn't see any grass," he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The term refers to feet that are smaller than usual, which indicate that a 
horse will run well on turf. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry won seven Eclipse Awards, including four grass championships, and 
was voted horse of the year in 1981 and 1984, the second time as a 9-year-old. 
Now 15, John Henry is stabled at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, where 
the public can visit him. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally thanked the late Maxwell Gluck, the owner of Elmendorf Farm, for being 
responsible for the trainer's getting John Henry when Rubin transferred the 
horse to California in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're young, you have many dreams, both night and day," McAnally said. 
"One of my dreams was to have a horse of this caliber. I'll be with him 
forever, and as long as he's around, I'll be around." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally, his mother dead and his father unable to support a large family, 
lived in a Kentucky orphanage for several years before he was introduced to 
racing's backstretch by his uncle, Reggie Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
An Englishman, Sheppard bought a one-way ticket on a cargo ship to the United 
States in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 21, and I sold my second-hand car and my second-hand horse," Sheppard 
said. "All I had when I got off the boat was $100 in my pocket and the 
addresses of some distant cousins in Connecticut." 
</P>
<P>
Sheppard thanked Burley Cocks for getting him started in the United States. 
Cocks, one of the Hall of Fame members present Thursday, trained Zaccio. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, dressed in a gray morning coat, accepted his plaque from Eddie 
Arcaro, a jockey who was inducted in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy, and a little nervous," Velasquez said. "But the day has 
arrived and I'm tickled to death. I'm very glad to belong to this very special 
group of champions. I thank God that He gave me this special life." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, last year's champion 3-year-old filly, makes her first start today 
since winning the Breeders' Cup Distaff last November. She won't be favored, 
however, in Saratoga's Ballerina, because the field includes Stormy But Valid, 
the California shipper who has won three stakes at Santa Anita and Hollywood 
Park this year. . . . Angel Cordero, who rode Open Mind to eight victories and 
two thirds in 11 starts last year, took a call on Stormy But Valid when he 
thought Open Mind wouldn't be running today. Gary Stevens has the mount on Open 
Mind. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the two best 3-year-old fillies in the country, Go for Wand and 
Charon, will run at Saratoga in the Alabama. . . . Steinlen is set to run 
Sunday in the Bernard Baruch Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Longden, inducted into the Hall of Fame as a jockey in 1958, called the 
hall last week, canceling his appearance at the ceremonies. Ralph Neves was 
another absent jockey. Among the trainers missing were Woody Stephens and Bill 
Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero, leading jockey at Saratoga for 13 of the last 14 years, received a 
court stay on a 10-day suspension and his case won't be reviewed until the end 
of the year. . . . Jose Santos, the jockey who broke Cordero's Saratoga streak 
in 1987, didn't contest a five-day suspension and began the meeting on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The factions in the expected proxy fight at Hollywood Park over the status of 
track president Marje Everett estimate that legal fees will cost each side $2 
million. Everett's fees would come from track coffers and the opposition's 
costs would have to be privately paid. . . . Bob Strub, chief executive officer 
at Santa Anita, said it is still possible that the track will get the Breeders' 
Cup in 1992, but negotiations have hit several snags. One point of disagreement 
is how much Santa Anita must charge its season-ticket holders. Strub feels that 
the prices suggested by the Breeders' Cup are considerably higher than they 
should be.

<P>
The Red Wings announced two days later that Fedorov had agreed to a contract.

NEWSWIRE: BOW-AND-ARROW BEAR HUNTING IS BLOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fund for Animals, headed by author Cleveland Amory, scored a major victory 
Thursday when Sacramento Superior Court blocked California's plan for a 
bow-and-arrow hunting season for bears. 
</P>
<P>
That season had been scheduled to open Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The organization also will try to halt the bear season for gun hunters. 
</P>
<P>
Amory said the Fund for Animals further plans to ask the court to disallow this 
year's waterfowl hunting season and will try to block all hunting and trapping 
of fur-bearing animals.

NOTRE DAME BACK SUES NCAA TO REGAIN COLLEGE ELIGIBILITY

Braxston Banks, a former Notre Dame running back, sued the NCAA in federal 
court Thursday in an effort to get another year of college eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Banks claims that NCAA rules making him ineligible to play this fall violate 
federal antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
The rules make a player ineligible after he signs for the NFL draft and retains 
an agent to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
Banks made himself available for the draft in April but was not selected. He 
graduated this summer and has applied to return to Notre Dame for a fifth year 
of studies. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asks the court to block the NCAA from enforcing the rules that 
prevent Banks from playing. The lawsuit also named Notre Dame and asked that 
the university be ordered to renew his scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, of Hayward, Calif., injured his knee during his sophomore season and 
decided to sit out the 1989 season, his senior year.

<P>
METS REALLY BATTLE BACK AND BEAT PHILLIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets, charged up by a fight in which Dwight Gooden, Darryl 
Strawberry and five others were ejected, rallied past the Philadelphia 
Phillies, 5-4, Thursday night at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl began in the fifth inning with Philadelphia leading, 3-1, when Pat 
Combs hit Gooden with a pitch above the left knee. Both benches and bullpens 
emptied. The melee lasted eight minutes and it was 20 minutes before play 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden was punched in the head several times by Philadelphia catcher Darren 
Daulton, but did not appear to be hurt. Combs left with a cut above his nose. 
The Mets' Tim Teufel was ejected, as were Daulton, Combs, Dennis Cook and 
bullpen coach Mike Ryan of the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden had hit Dickie Thon and Tom Herr with pitches earlier in the game, but 
there were no incidents. After Gooden was hit, he rushed to the mound and was 
tackled by Combs. Daulton jumped in and hit Gooden in the head. Strawberry, who 
was in the clubhouse when the fight started, charged onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' winning rally came in the sixth. Kevin McReynolds walked and was 
forced by Daryl Boston, who stole second and continued to third on a wild throw 
by Tom Nieto. Howard Johnson followed with his 17th homer, tying it at 3-3. Tom 
O'Malley singled and Mackey Sasser doubled. Pinch-hitter Kelvin Torve then hit 
a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, coupled with Pittsburgh's loss to Montreal, pulled New York back 
to within half a game of the Pirates in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 7, Pittsburgh 6 -- Andres Galarraga scored from second base in the 
10th inning on Mike Fitzgerald's bad-hop grounder at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Landrum walked Galarraga to start the 10th and Marquis Grissom sacrificed. 
Fitzgerald hit a grounder off the plate and was thrown out at first by Slaught. 
</P>
<P>
When Slaught, who was backing up first base, didn't immediately return to the 
plate, Galarraga kept running and scored. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Chicago 1 -- Lance Dickson pitched well at Chicago, but lost in 
his first major league appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson was outpitched by Ken Hill, who gave up four hits and had a shutout 
until Jerome Walton's leadoff homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson, a 20-year-old left-hander from the University of Arizona who was 
Chicago's first pick in the June amateur draft, gave up eight hits, walked one 
and struck out three in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 7, Atlanta 0 -- Bruce Hurst pitched a six-hitter at Atlanta as the 
Padres won for the sixth time in eight games on their current trip.

U.S. SOCCER TEAM PRIMED FOR TWO MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still reeling from the last World Cup, the U.S. soccer team will take a small 
and somewhat uncertain step toward the next one with games tonight and Sunday 
in the Marlboro Cup of New York. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said Thursday he is concerned that his players are more 
focused on their meeting Sunday with Los Angeles attorney Alan Rothenberg, 
elected last weekend as president of the U.S. Soccer Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler has been besieged by questions about Rothenberg's potential impact on 
the national team program from his players, many of whom are under contract 
through next year at the federation's option. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler, who has coached the team for 20 months, also faces an uncertain 
future. He said this summer that he has a commitment to coach the team through 
the 1994 World Cup from former USSF president Werner Fricker. 
</P>
<P>
But Rothenberg, after outpolling Fricker in last Sunday's election, said he 
will review all USSF personnel, including Gansler. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Cale, who assisted in Rothenberg's campaign, said the new president has 
an open mind. "He's not going back there with any pink slips," Cale said. 
</P>
<P>
In the tournament at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the U.S. will 
play Flamengo of Brazil tonight. 
</P>
<P>
All starters from the United States' 0-3 World Cup effort are available except 
midfielder Tab Ramos and forward Peter Vermes, who will play for teams in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Players from seven World Cup teams, including forward Roger Milla of Cameroon 
and goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea of Argentina, will lead a team of World 
All-Stars against the Mexican All-Stars Tuesday at 8 p.m. at the Coliseum. 
According to organizers, proceeds will benefit the World Children's Transplant 
Fund.

TENNIS SAN DIEGO TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
FAIRBANK-NIDEFFER FINALLY FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The psychological see-saw Ros Fairbank-Nideffer of Escondido has been riding 
all week tottered back and forth, then finally knocked her off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The beneficiary was Barbara Paulus, and the Austrian went on to defeat 
Fairbank-Nideffer, 7-5, 6-3, in a quarterfinal of the $225,000 Great American 
Bank Tennis Tournament at the San Diego Tennis &amp; Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
It has been an suspenseful week for Fairbank-Nideffer. One day, she was psyched 
to play a first-round match against Martina Navratilova -- before Navratilova 
withdrew because of an ankle injury -- and the next day, she orchestrated a 
comeback victory against hometown rival Angelica Gavaldon. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours later, she fell apart against Paulus, playing what she said 
was a match she wouldn't have paid to see. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could get back (in it) because the match had been so awful," 
Fairbank-Nideffer said. "At that point, I found myself thinking, 'This is 
terrible. I wouldn't pay a dime to be watching this match.' Both of us were 
making terrible errors." 
</P>
<P>
Fairbank-Nideffer double-faulted three consecutive times to close out the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Paulus agreed that it wasn't tennis at its best. 
</P>
<P>
"I played well, but I've had many better matches," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the featured evening match, fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria 
defeated Ann Grossman, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I ran out of gas. I think that's what it came down to," said 
Grossman, who played three consecutive days. "If I had a day off, I definitely 
would have been stronger in the second set." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, third-seeded Zina Garrison of Houston routed Nathalie Herreman of 
France, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Joining semifinalists Maleeva-Fragniere and Paulus, who will play Saturday, and 
quarterfinalist Garrison are Terry Phelps, Nathalie Tauziat of France and 
top-seeded Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think I have good chances," Maleeva said. "I think because I'm 
aggressive, I've been hitting the ball really well, I'm confident. I'm happy 
with the way I'm playing all week." 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva's sister, Katerina Maleeva, might have some advice after playing and 
losing to Graf in the final of the Canadian Open Sunday in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't talked yet about (a possible meeting with Graf)," she said. "We've 
talked about her match, we always talk, but I'm sure she'll give me some 
advice." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Terry Phelps, who can be seen here at the pool as often as on the tennis 
courts, meets Zina Garrison in tonight's featured match. An avid football fan 
and friend of quarterback Tony Eason of the New York Jets, Phelps has snagged 
tickets for Saturday night's San Diego Charger-Dallas Cowboy game. The 
semifinals are scheduled for 12:30 p.m. and 6:30 Saturday.

SWIMMING JUNIOR OLYMPICS LONG COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
JACOB KEEPS BUSY, SETS MEET RECORD IN 200 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The past two weeks have been tiring for Lisa Jacob. Rewarding, but tiring. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob, 16, spent last week in Austin, Tex., at the U.S. Swimming Long Course 
National Championships. She finished sixth in the 800-meter freestyle and 12th 
in the 400 freestyle, with personal-best times in both. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of resting on that success, Jacob is improving on it. Thursday, she 
finished first in the 200 freestyle at the U.S. Swimming Junior Olympics West 
at Heritage Park in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob's time of 2:03.41 broke the Junior Olympic West record of 2:03.89, set by 
Cheryl Simmons in 1985. Her time was also less than a second off the national 
junior record of 2:03.14, held by Yvette Bobling. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised with my time because I'm so tired," said Jacob, who 
swims for the Mission Viejo Nadadores. "I've been trying to get as much sleep 
as I can because I was so tired after the Senior Nationals. I wasn't sure if 
that would hurt me at this meet. " 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's victory was the second of the meet for Jacob, who won the 100 
freestyle. She trailed Teresa Mauck through most of the race, but managed to 
take the lead with 50 meters to go and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob's strength, however, is in the distance events, and she has performed 
well enough in those to qualify for the Senior Nationals the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Jacob, who will be a junior at Capistrano Valley High in the 
fall, cannot compete in any of the distance events at the Junior Olympic meet. 
Under U.S. Swimming rules, a swimmer can't compete in the same events in both 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
John Blaney and Robert Fleming also won their second events of the meet 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Blaney, who also swims for the Nadadores, held on to win the 400 individual 
medley in 4:32.51. He won the 800 freestyle on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, a native of Houston, won the 200 freestyle Thursday in 1:53.60. On 
Wednesday, he won the 100 freestyle.

STRINGS FINISH FAST, FINISH RACQUETS

<P>
The Los Angeles Strings' strategy of saving their best for last paid off 
Thursday night in the TeamTennis Western Division final. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the play of John Lloyd and Robin White, the league's top-ranked mixed 
doubles team, the Strings defeated the defending champion San Antonio Racquets, 
24-18, before 775 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Strings, making their first playoff appearance in six years, advanced to 
Sunday night's championship match at the Forum where they will meet the winner 
of tonight's Eastern Division final between the Raleigh Edge and the Miami 
Beach Breakers at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio, which also won the league championship in 1986, missed the final 
for only the second time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Strings, who won the TeamTennis title in 1981 when Martina Navratilova was 
a member of the team, had a league-best 12-2 regular-season record and are 8-0 
at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that success, Lloyd, the Strings' player-coach, took advantage of a 
league rule that allows the home team to determine the order that the men's and 
women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles matches will be 
played. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about changing the order," said Lloyd, whose team lost its final 
regular-season match at San Antonio last Sunday. "But I thought, 'What the 
hell. If we can stay even until the last two sets, we'd have a great chance." 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 12-12, after three sets, before White defeated Elna 
Reinach, 6-3, to give the Strings an 18-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd and White defeated Sammy Giammalva and Reinach, 6-3, to secure the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Strings took command of the match early when Anne White and Robin White 
defeated Mary Lou Daniels and Reinach, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio came back behind Giammalva, who took all but one point from Nick 
Brown in four games. Brown was replaced by Lloyd who lost the final two games 
in a 6-0 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd and Brown defeated Giammalva and Dacio Campos, 6-3.

EVIL WITCH ADDS MAGIC TO PRODUCTION OF 'PRINCESS AND THE PEA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the fairy tale "The Princess and the Pea," the heroine has it plenty tough. 
A good night's sleep is hard to come by when you are disturbed by a pea beneath 
20 mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
But in the musical comedy playing for children at the Glendale Centre Theatre, 
the princess has it even tougher. Not only is she as sensitive as ever, she 
also has an evil witch turning her suitors into animals. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Wicked Wilhelmina to the story enables producer-director Tim 
Dietlein and his 15-member cast to delight children with characters in animal 
costumes. The witch also serves as another obstacle on the rocky path of true 
love between princess and prince. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which is staged at Saturday matinees only, opened in April and will 
continue through Oct. 13. Dietlein said the production has been drawing 
enthusiastic crowds of 300 to 350 to the 430-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we're theater-in-the-round, the audience feels very involved," he 
said. "The kids love it, and we've put in some jokes that adults can 
appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
Dietlein's grandparents founded Glendale Centre Theatre 45 years ago. In 
addition to producing and directing "The Princess and the Pea," he plays one of 
the princess' suitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been acting since I could walk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Marsha, plays the princess. 
</P>
<P>
Meghan Jones, who portrays the witch, said children between 6 and 10 seem to 
enjoy the show most. 
</P>
<P>
"But we get everything from babies to grandfathers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The show, with about 10 songs and a variety of richly made costumes, lasts an 
hour and 20 minutes and has an intermission. The original fairy tale has been 
tinkered with, but the princess remains as fussy as ever. 
</P>
<P>
"When the suitors come," Jones said, "she doesn't like any of them. One's too 
aggressive, one's too egotistical, one's just too wimpy." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the central fairy tale plot point remains in the play; at a crucial 
juncture the princess must sleep on top of 20 mattresses as a test of her 
sensitivity and thus her royal lineage. 
</P>
<P>
Dietlein said young audiences love the show for the same reason that he prefers 
producing children's theater to adult plays. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be more colorful and more broad," he said. "It's just more magical."

JUDGE BARS WILDMON ART BROCHURE MAILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York judge has barred a conservative religious organization from 
distributing a brochure containing out-of-context excerpts from a controversial 
New York artist's work. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ruled late Wednesday that the Rev. Donald Wildmon and his 
American Family Assn., a Tupelo, Miss.-based media watchdog organization, must 
send a court-approved correction to the 4,000 churches, members of Congress and 
others who received the pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
The court rejected multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz's claim for $5 million 
in damages, however, and ordered Wildmon's group to pay the artist a token $1. 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz accused the American Family Assn. of reprinting severely cropped 
segments of 14 large images he created (for a one-man show titled "Tongues of 
Flame") and mailing them in an inflammatory broadside to religious groups and 
government officials as part of Wildmon's ongoing attack on the National 
Endowment for the Arts' funding of sexually explicit works. The suit was filed 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
"Tongues of Flame," which was funded in part by a $15,000 NEA grant, is on 
display at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and runs through Sept. 5 in 
conjunction with the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The images excerpted in Wildmon's brochure, which were not identified as being 
taken out of context, all contain strong sexual or religious overtones. Many of 
the cropped fragments included depictions of homosexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William C. Connor barred further publication of the 
pamphlet, "Your Tax Dollars Helped Pay for These Works of 'Art,' " claiming it 
had probably harmed the artist's professional and personal reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Connor said that because no gallery or museum exhibit of Wojnarowicz's 
work had been canceled, the artist had not proved financial damage and only 
awarded him $1 of the $5 million in damages he sought to recover in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz applauded the decision as a blow to forces attempting to stifle 
creative expression. 
</P>
<P>
"Wildmon used distortion, half-truths and manipulation of facts and the judge 
in this case has determined that such practices violate the law," Wojnarowicz 
said in a telephone interview. "If this ruling inspires other people whose 
rights have been trampled to realize that you can fight back and win, I think 
it's great." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Donald Wildmon could not be reached for comment, but his brother Allen 
Wildmon, the American Family Assn.'s associate director, said the group does 
not view the judge's ruling as a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody sues you for $5 million dollars and a judge only awards him $1, 
I think that's about as close to a victory that you can get," Wildmon said. "We 
feel the judge placed the proper value on Wojnarowicz's work -- we feel that $1 
is about all it's worth." 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz acknowledged that he felt shortchanged: "What I want to know is 
whether I get the dollar in cash or check?"

CUTBACKS, LACK OF ACCESS HURT IRAQ TV COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis in the Middle East is a conflict that refuses to cooperate with 
television. 
</P>
<P>
In a world that more often than not makes way for TV cameras, the networks -- 
with hundreds of correspondents, producers, photographers and staff members 
massing on the fringes of the conflict -- can't get into Iraq, Kuwait or Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't cover the story if you're not there," said David Miller, director of 
foreign news coverage at NBC. "It's like covering a forest fire and not being 
at the forest fire." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to gain access even to U.S. warships, forced in some instances to report 
by telephone from secret locations in Persian Gulf emirates, television news 
from the Middle East has weighed in heavily on the side of words and lightly in 
terms of pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign correspondents -- many brought in from the field because of budget 
cutbacks -- were rousted out of new assignments in Burbank and New York and 
sent to makeshift Mideast bureaus. One nation on the fringes of the conflict, 
the tiny emirate of Dubai, has allowed reporters in, but only on the condition 
that the correspondents not name the country in their reports. Instead, they 
must say that they are reporting "from the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an area of the world where (we) don't have a great deal of resources, and 
people have to be moved from great distances," said Robert Murphy, vice 
president for news coverage at ABC. "And the fact that access to Saudi Arabia 
and Iraq and Kuwait is impossible makes covering the story very, very 
difficult. You've got to almost set up listening posts." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of the local bureaus are little more than listening posts. 
Network crews monitor Iraqi and Saudi television and send taped copies of that 
footage home to New York. Reporters -- including CBS lead anchor Dan Rather -- 
frantically work the phones and prepare reports that won't be accompanied by 
live pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Bit even the verbal reports have been difficult to obtain: At least once this 
week there was no room on the primary communications satellite that links the 
Middle East and the United States. To get their reports home, CBS, NBC and ABC 
had to beam them the long way around the world, across the Indian Ocean, at a 
cost twice that of a normal transmission. 
</P>
<P>
For pictures, crews take off in helicopters and photograph ship movements in 
the Gulf, said Miller. The only event to which reporters will have full access 
is the Arab League summit in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a crew to the Suez Canal and got pictures of the U.S.S. Eisenhower 
going through," Miller said. "And a crew got pictures of F-111s taking off from 
Turkey -- and there aren't supposed to be F-111s in Turkey." 
</P>
<P>
The verbal nature of the story has prompted different strategies for deploying 
network anchors. Rather is the only network anchor currently on the scene, with 
NBC and ABC saying that their anchors are better off in New York, where they 
can conduct on-air interviews with correspondents and world figures. ABC did 
say Thursday that it was sending "Nightline" host Ted Koppel to Egypt for the 
summit, however, where he will serve as a "sub-anchor" to Peter Jennings on 
"Nightly News" on top of his "Nightline" duties. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Rather -- who sources at the network say is tentatively scheduled to go to 
Cairo today -- spent the first days of the crisis in Jordan, reporting by 
telephone while the network ran a still photograph of him along with a map of 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Producers and news executives say the lack of pictures has affected coverage, 
skewing it more toward the analytical and away from dependence on the day's hot 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing now what we were supposed to be doing all along, and that's 
reporting -- and not just creating pretty packages," said Lane Venardos, 
director and executive producer of special events for CBS News. "We miss having 
the pictures because we are a visual medium, but we're also journalists. All 
too often in this business the journalism gets buried under the pictures." 
</P>
<P>
So far, NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN have beefed up existing bureaus in Israel and 
Egypt, and established makeshift bureaus in Amman, Jordan; Dubai, the United 
Arab Emirates; Ankara, Turkey; and Damascus, Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, reporters are working out of hotel rooms in some cities where the 
networks once had fully functional bureaus. Cutbacks over the past several 
years have led NBC to close its bureaus in Jordan and the Persian Gulf and to 
cut its Cairo operation to a small office with no correspondent. CBS maintains 
a bureau in Israel, but only a small office in Cairo and no other regular 
bureaus in the Middle East. And the scaling back has not been limited to the 
region. CBS recently closed its bureaus in Paris and Athens. 
</P>
<P>
"We closed them because there was nothing going on," said NBC's Miller. "We 
just can't keep bureaus open to look nice. We just haven't got the money any 
more to keep bureaus functioning when they're not in the news." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a thinly stretched news corps covering a story with serious 
implications for not only international affairs, but -- with the impending loss 
of oil shipments from Iraq and Kuwait -- for the world economy as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no pinch from having cut back," said ABC's Murphy. "But there's no 
question that if another major story in the world breaks, were going to have a 
hard time covering it." 
</P>
<P>
Only the Cable News Network, the 24-hour news service owned by Atlanta 
businessman Ted Turner, has been expanding instead of contracting its reach. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't send green hands into a story like this that could potentially be 
quite dangerous," said Ed Turner, CNN executive vice president for news 
gathering. "It's not an easy story to report." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hess, a news analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., 
said that by cutting back their bureaus around the world, the networks risk 
having no experts in an area in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage of the current imbroglio in the Middle East, Hess said, is a case in 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"This is real parachute journalism," Hess said. "There is not one person who 
has dropped in there who has great knowledge of the Middle East, who speaks 
Arabic or has a Ph.D. in Arab studies." 
</P>
<P>
Also fueling the cutbacks, Hess said, are technological improvements that allow 
correspondents and crews to move so quickly in and out of different parts of 
the world that they can be based in New York or London and still cover breaking 
news in faraway places. 
</P>
<P>
Venardos, at CBS, conceded that there might be reporters sent to a trouble spot 
who have never been there before, but said that was the nature of news 
gathering. "Ultimately, people will be over there who will be first-timers, and 
then they'll be second-timers the next time they're over there," Venardos said. 
"That's how you get experience."

EVERYTHING'S JAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Two Jakes" (citywide) may be the only movie in memory with a prerequisite: 
Before seeing it, see "Chinatown" -- again or for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to live in the past," Jack Nicholson's detective, J.J. (Jake) 
Gittes, says fervently. "I just don't want to lose it." Well, lose Jake's 
"Chinatown" past and you cut yourself off from "The Two Jakes' " deepest 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, it's almost impossible to judge how "The Two Jakes" would seem to 
someone who had never seen "Chinatown," since once you've seen that classic 
it's with you inextricably. I've seen it probably once a year since 1974. The 
best I can say is that the intricate weave of Robert Towne's "Jakes" screenplay 
stands on its own, but with nothing like the richness it will have for 
"Chinatown" veterans. 
</P>
<P>
That past makes the elegiac "Jakes" funnier, deeper, even more evocative. It 
reinforces its great theme, the "development" of Los Angeles and the price tag 
for that "progress," a theme planned to stretch across three films. The third 
seems absolutely essential now after the riches of "Jakes." 
</P>
<P>
In "Chinatown," Roman Polanski was the perfect conduit for the edgy, dangerous 
sensuality of '30s Los Angeles; director Jack Nicholson's very American 
sensibilities may be just right for the brash, brighter postwar section of the 
trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
The story pulls Gittes back where he doesn't want to be, to his memories of 
"Chinatown's" mesmerizing Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), whose life he 
couldn't, finally, protect. (In "Jakes," David Keith's hard-nosed cop, Loach, 
is the son of the policeman whose single shot killed Evelyn in the presence of 
her 16-year-old daughter, Katherine.) A wire recording Jake makes at the scene 
of an illicit love affair mentions Katherine Mulwray's name, and Jake, the good 
detective, is off to search for this fragile icon of his memories. 
</P>
<P>
It's a briskly challenging plot, probably easier than "The Big Sleep," the 
high-water mark in tangled detective stories, but only slightly. The difference 
is that there's the sense of something valuable at the bottom of "The Two 
Jakes' " mystery; the vision of a city being raped a second time in the name of 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Jakes" has its second-stage villain too, oil baron Earl Rowley (Richard 
Farnsworth.) Quite understandably, he's not the towering figure that John 
Huston's Noah Cross was -- we will not see Huston's kind on screen again. Also, 
Cross' sins were sexual as well as financial; we see only the business side of 
Rowley. Huston made you believe Cross' pure, genial pan-amorality. There's 
something intrinsically decent about Farnsworth that keeps Rowley from being a 
true monster. 
</P>
<P>
The film opens with the same punch to a husband's pride as 'Chinatown" did. 
It's 1948, and postwar euphoria is in the air. Jake Gittes' investigation 
business has prospered since the bloody ending of that story some 11 movie 
years earlier. He's now a 6-handicap member of a country club and an 
unpersuasively engaged man, while the husband receiving the bad news of his 
wife's infidelity is a very rich real-estate developer. He and Jake share 
identical two-tone shoes and even the same name; the client is Jake Berman 
(Harvey Keitel), and it's his wife, Kitty (Meg Tilly), who's soon to be 
surprised at the Bird of Paradise Motel in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As the Jakes commiserate, a small earthquake (not the last temblor in "Jakes," 
either) shakes Gittes' low, Moderne offices. Suddenly you realize the scene's 
peculiar power: Except for those that are about earthquakes, none of the slew 
of movies that have tried so hard to capture the mood of Los Angeles have faced 
this essential fact of life here -- you cannot even trust the ground under your 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
That feeling of instability may lie so deep it's almost subliminal, but it's 
there, certainly perceptible to a writer who picks up emotions and motivations 
as seismically as Towne. He's made these shocks and aftershocks part of the 
fabric of the film, a weave of facts and memories caught so precisely that we 
can feel life in the Los Angeles Basin just at the end of the Second World War. 
</P>
<P>
Towne serves up the pleasant and the venal with equal relish; angora sweaters 
and anti-Semitism; lone oil wells dotting neighborhoods like tireless dunk 'em 
birds and "The Whistler" coming out of a Hudson convertible's radio; country 
clubs and G.I. tract homes where neither Jews nor Mexicans need apply; old 
Pasadena influence and up-and-coming gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
The ruminative narration was reportedly written by Nicholson and laid on last. 
It's serviceable and even helpful; only in a few places of metaphor overload 
does it sound as though Nicholson had been watching too much Edgar Ulmer or 
listening to too much of Joe Frank's Work in Progress. Clearly, it ain't Robert 
Towne, but t'will serve. 
</P>
<P>
It is, in any event, a lovingly assembled cast in a brilliantly detailed 
production, with special notice to Vilmos Zsigmond's haunting cinematography, 
which seems somehow to have captured the light as it was, pre-smog. By now 
Nicholson owns J.J. Gittes, and he has thought carefully about the experiences 
that shaped Jake over the last 11 years. They're all there for the reading -- 
in his face, his comfortably thickened body, in his fleeting look of 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
There are layers and layers, too, to Harvey Keitel's beautifully detailed work 
as Jake Berman, and an absolutely perfect performance by Meg Tilly as the 
serenely beautiful Kitty. Madeleine Stowe is hilariously good as the 
angora-wearing widow. It's wonderful to see James Hong's Khan out of servant's 
livery and into his own nursery garden, to see Perry Lopez's remarkably fair 
Captain Escobar, there to balance David Keith's perfect louse, Loach, and to 
revel in Eli Wallach's smoothie, Cotton Weinberger, who may just recall Jerry 
Geisler. 
</P>
<P>
And as for the optimistic thought that there will be a final chapter, it cannot 
come a moment too soon.

HIS GROWING PAINS ARE HIS MOVIE NOW; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: WHIT STILLMAN'S 'METROPOLITAN' LOOKS AT THE LIVES OF YOUNG NEW YORK 
SOCIALITES. IT'S HIS LIFE, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first few days of filming his movie, "Metropolitan," freshman 
writer-director Whit Stillman clutched his security blanket, a copy of a book 
called "How to Direct a Movie." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Stillman was uncomfortable with the logistics of directing, but he was 
right at home with the scene he set: lush Manhattan apartments filled with 
elegantly dressed young debs and their dates gabbing intensely about love and 
life at "after-parties." The independent romantic comedy, opening today, about 
the growing pains of a gang of young New York socialites was right out of 
Stillman's own experience with that crowd in New York circa 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Stillman spent many a tuxedoed night with the billowy dresses 
and white gloves and velvety furniture talking about sociology, literature, sex 
and romance. "So the subject for the film just sort of fell into my lap," said 
the Harvard graduate whose film career followed years of dabbling in book 
publishing, journalism and film distribution. "I tried writing about that world 
in college, trying to be F. Scott Fitzgerald. It never worked. I was too close 
to the material." 
</P>
<P>
With time and distance, he was ready to approach it. "For 10 years I was 
totally estranged and not involved in that scene, so I could go back to it with 
this distance and humorous take on it, and it really worked." 
</P>
<P>
"Metropolitan" first grabbed the attention of critics at the U.S. Film Festival 
in Park City, Utah, last winter, then at the New York New Films/New Directors 
series and the Directors Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Stillman is overwhelmed that it's really happening to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe this? I'm in the director's suite," he said, looking out 
French doors to the sun-splashed Hollywood Hills from his room at the Ma Maison 
Sofitel, where he was staying during a recent promotional stop. At Cannes, he 
stayed in a hotel he described dryly as "very normal, less than normal, sort of 
awful." At the time, he was counting every penny for a film that he says came 
in for less than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his preppy blue blazer, white shirt and pants, and Kelly green tie, Stillman 
looks ready for the yacht club. He looks like a grown-up version of the 
characters in his movie, which he said became a breeze to direct. "After a 
while I felt like a duck in water directing -- it was just what I wanted to do. 
It was a incredible sense of exhilaration." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the distance in years from his nights dancing by the fountain at the 
Plaza Hotel, his vision of the film was clear. "I felt really close to it," he 
said. "I wanted to tell a story about the past. I wanted to sort of treat it 
ironically and make fun of the obsessions of those years." 
</P>
<P>
For Stillman, those obsessions included being lost in the world of Fitzgerald 
novels, the sociological theories of Charles Fourier and daydreams of one 
charming New York socialite girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how you fool yourself when you have a crush," he said. "I 
practically never saw her, but I convinced myself that she was my girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Stillman explained that this girl was his entree into the world of the young 
socialites. "Getting to know that world better was a way to get to know her 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Although his family took part in the socialite scene, "they were hostile to it 
at the same time." His father was a lawyer with the Kennedy Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In "Metropolitan," the character Tom is smitten just as Stillman says he was. 
And like Stillman, he could play both sides when it came to the deb set. A 
socialist thinker with one tuxedo to his name, one thin raincoat and a divorced 
set of parents, he was at once an outsider and an insider. 
</P>
<P>
Stillman spread himself around in the film, he said other characters in the 
so-called "Sally Fowler Rat Pack" were parts of him: Audrey, the naive Jane 
Austen-loving heroine; Nick, the aggressive fast talker, and Charlie, who is 
stuck on the doomed condition of his social class. 
</P>
<P>
When you meet Stillman, it's hard not to hear his characters when he talks. His 
speech is fast, ideas pop out suddenly and the satirical wit from his Harvard 
Hasty Pudding days is thrown in. " 'There's a lot of Whit up there,' my friends 
say when they see it." 
</P>
<P>
As Carolyn Farina, a first-time feature actress who plays Audrey, put it, "He 
knew those characters back and forth; he definitely knew what he wanted from 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The cast was made up of unknowns, because Stillman could not afford established 
stars. "I was looking for happy campers, because we were going to be camping 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Stillman was a well-groomed camper in the blazer and fedora he often wore to 
the filming. "We were in these very fancy places, and I thought it was a good 
idea not to look too filmic." 
</P>
<P>
Although for a long time, filmic was exactly what Stillman wanted to be: "But I 
didn't have the guts." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he went through a mini-identity crisis. He could not find his true 
vocational calling. He even took an aptitude test that said he should be an 
architect, but after devouring architecture books, he decided it was not for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
His ideas about failure are woven through his film. Stillman invented a word in 
the film for the group plagued by the sense of doom he shares -- UHB -- which 
stands for Urban Haute Bourgeoisie. 
</P>
<P>
What's an UHBie? Not a preppy or a WASP but a member of a group that because of 
its social status has no where to go but down. The original tag line of 
"Metropolitan" was "Doomed. Bourgeois. In Love." Because he thought it was too 
depressing for a comedy, Stillman changed it to "A story of the downwardly 
mobile." He hopes the term UHB will start a craze. "It seems to me a perfect 
term to describe that condition." 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of illusions and attitude problems when talking about people 
in the UHB background." He had firsthand experience: "Before I made a film I 
wasn't a terrible failure, but I was succeeding OK at something I had no 
identification with at all." 
</P>
<P>
He eventually became involved in the film business as a sales agent for Spanish 
films. In that role, he went to Cannes annually for several years. 
</P>
<P>
One Cannes night in 1985 at a cheap restaurant, the urge to write his own film 
finally became compelling. He started scribbling away. 
</P>
<P>
Stillman went through a four-year process of writing the film late at night. 
While writing, it never seemed real. "You sort of feel you're in a dreamland." 
</P>
<P>
He made it real by approaching some of his friends, "who had some spare change 
they could afford to lose on a friend's film." 
</P>
<P>
Will people not from the background understand the New York-centric milieu and 
get the jokes? "I think people will enjoy the fact that the film has texture. 
They will sense that there is a joke there, even if they don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
As he awaits the film's opening, Stillman the doomsayer is wary that things are 
going too well. But he worries about the fate of his next script, the story of 
two American men who become involved in the youth culture in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"I am comfortable with everyday anxiety. I was happy in my failure," he said.

CLASS STUGGLES OF THE UPPER STRATA IN 'METROPOLITAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cozying up to "Metropolitan" (Cineplex Beverly Center, AMC Century 14) becomes 
a real test of toleration: how compassionate are you about the very rich and 
rather dim? Not at all? Then this romantic comedy of manners, set during a 
single New York Christmas season of debutante balls and after-parties, may set 
your teeth grinding. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you bear in mind that its debuting writer-director-producer, Whit 
Stillman intended "Metropolitan" as very gentle irony, you're already ahead. 
After all, he can't be too stuffy; he subtitled his slice-of-high-life "Doomed. 
Bourgeois. In Love." And as it turns out, Stillman's gift for quiet, scrupulous 
observation grows on you. 
</P>
<P>
"Metropolitan" is set sometime in the recent past and it is unabashedly 
autobiographical; roughly 15 years ago Stillman was his outsider-protagonist 
Tom Townsend locked priggishly in a love-hate relationship with the UHB. UHB? 
Ah, that's the title one of the group drawlingly confers on his "doomed" peers: 
the Urban Haute Bourgeoisie; "More sociologically precise than preppie." 
</P>
<P>
Tom (Edward Clements), in from Princeton for Christmas vacation, thinks himself 
in moral opposition to every UHB born. He announces, frequently, that he 
follows Charles Fourier, the 19th-Century social reformer whose theories were 
tried out by Brooke Farm. It's envy, of course. Tom's an insider tossed outside 
by the two dreaded words "divorce" and "stepmother." 
</P>
<P>
The art directors of "Metropolitan," who seem to have gotten everything exactly 
right, have the Townsend's apartment down pat: comfortable, faintly shabby, 
brave; a few "good" pieces from the divorce, probably his mother's before the 
marriage. It reeks of reduced circumstances and it -- and his mother, who no 
longer has her son's illusions about when his father is going to call them -- 
is terribly touching. 
</P>
<P>
Red-headed Tom is swept into the Sally Fowler Rat Pack by the simple accident 
of sharing a cab with this inner circle of debs and their escorts. Since he 
seems to be one of them, they invite him up to Sally's for a ritual of 
post-party gossip and deeply earnest conversation about art ("the Surrealists 
were just a bunch of social climbers") or the bleak future of their class. And 
in a ball season where there is a severe shortage of acceptable escorts, Tom is 
suddenly penciled in as Available. It will become the erosion of his every 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a while to sort the Pack out, but shiny-haired Audrey Rouget (the 
delightful Carolyn Farina) is clearly its overlooked treasure. Director 
Stillman performs a deadpan introduction to Audrey, in tears over a crack her 
(unseen) little brother has made about an (unnamed) part of her anatomy. Audrey 
reads, she thinks, she feels -- acutely. It does rather set her apart from most 
of Sally's set. Tom reads too, but reviews, not the books themselves. Not even 
an admission like that dims Audrey's growing love for him. 
</P>
<P>
The caustic Nick Smith (Christopher Eigerman), is the Pack's leader. If he's 
more understanding than the rest about Tom's peculiarities -- public 
transportation, a light raincoat instead of a warm topcoat, a rented tux -- it 
may come from their shared experience as kids with divorced, remarried fathers. 
Charlie Black (Taylor Nichols), with his wire glasses and impacted admiration 
of Audrey, is the group's moralist; Cynthia McLean (Isabel Gillies) is its 
sexual adventurer and the somnolent Fred Neff (Bryan Leder) seems to have 
mastered middle-age before he's turned 24. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Pack but crucial to it and the story are the season's glamour girl, 
Serena Slocum (Elizabeth Thompson), to whom Tom wrote impassioned letters in 
boarding school and international jet-setter Rick von Sloneker (Will Kempe), 
who finds using his title "baron" an unnecessary bore. (Unfortunately, in a 
role that needs blase Eurostyle charisma, Kempe manages only the blase.) 
</P>
<P>
Filmmaker Stillman is a pointillist, working in the tiniest, most meticulous 
degrees. If he seems at times as controlled and distanced as his own UHBs, his 
impulsive, romantic ending betrays him. Stillman understands caste, class and 
deportment as perfectly as Audrey's idol, Jane Austen and by the time he's 
through, so do we.

JAZZ NOTES: BE-BOP COMPETITION BLOWS INTO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Be-boppers take heed! Jazz aficionado Bill Sinclair has decided to take his 
love for be-bop another step by announcing the Southern California Be-Bop 
Blowoff (SCBB), a contest with $900 in prize money that's designed for both 
professionals and amateurs, young and old alike. The idea of the contest, where 
the emphasis will be on individual artists rather than groups, is "to give good 
music a boost which it . . . needs," says Sinclair in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The competition begins with audition by tape submission, and those selected 
will appear in play-offs in Los Angeles area nightclubs. Sinclair says that all 
phases of the contest will be judged by qualified jazz educators. 
</P>
<P>
For information, send a self-addressed envelope to: SCBB, 22932 Vermont Avenue, 
Torrance, 90502.

Time for Women: New York-based pianist/singer Barbara Carroll -- who's 
currently appearing Tuesday through Saturday in the lounge of the Westwood 
Marquis and Gardens Hotel in Westwood -- has been in the jazz business for 40 
years and says that things are finally getting better for the women musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," says the artist who's usually heard in the Bemelman's Bar of 
Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel, where she's been a mainstay for more than a decade. 
"When I began playing, it wasn't the case. Now a women isn't prejudged the way 
she was in the past, when it was automatically assumed she couldn't play. I 
don't think that happens any more." 
</P>
<P>
The pianist, who arrived on the New York jazz scene in the late '40s, played 
with guitarists Chuck Wayne and Charlie Byrd before stepping out with her own 
trio. "When I first came to New York, I worked at the Down Beat club on 52nd 
Street, opposite Dizzy Gillespie's big band," she recalls. "I was so thrilled 
because (the Street was where) all my idols, like Billie Holiday, Charlie 
Parker and Art Tatum, were working." 
</P>
<P>
In the early '50s, Carroll led a trio at the Embers, a midtown room. "It was a 
wonderful jazz room, and I shared the bill with Art Tatum. It was like playing 
opposite God," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll who played the Westwood Marquis in January and February and continues 
there through Sept. 15, likes the 90-seat room -- "It's very comfy" -- and says 
the audiences have been "very responsive. Fortunately, there have been quite a 
number of (listeners), and they've been very attentive, and great to play for." 
</P>
<P>
The pianist, whose most recent release is "Old Friends" (Audiophile), says her 
performances are based on "essentially what I have always done, but with more 
singing. So I play jazz, improvising on standards and good show tunes with jazz 
classics and my originals mixed in." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll continues to find the jazz medium striking a warm chord with her. "I 
love the freedom of being able to take a song and play it differently each 
time, never being bound to playing it the same way," she says. "And since I'm 
playing alone, I really have that freedom. It makes it more interesting for me, 
and for the audience."

BARYSHNIKOV TO TOUR WITH NEW COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER CATALANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail Baryshnikov, who dances the choreography of Mark Morris with a series 
of engagements in 18 cities in the Midwest and South this fall, will skip the 
major metropolitan cities in his new company's inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Sterner, spokeswoman for Baryshnikov Productions, the producer of the 
tour, said the 42-year-old dancer will be joined by seven other dancers from 
around the country as part of the White Oak Dance Project that starts in Oct. 
24 and continues through mid-November. The tour will wind its way through Ohio, 
Florida and other parts of the South. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sterner, the White Oak Dance Project was conceived as an "outlet 
to give people across the country an access to the work of Mark Morris, which 
is the important thing." Morris, 33, will not tour with the company. If the 
tour is successful, Sterner said the White Oak Dance Project will visit the 
major metropolitan areas in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Currently Morris and the dancers for the White Oak Dance Project, including 
Baryshnikov, are secluded at the White Oak Plantation, in Yulee, Fla., near 
Jacksonville. Their sponsor is the philanthropist, Howard Gilman, who is 
assisting Baryshnikov Productions in booking and promoting the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Misha and Howard's vision to produce this tour across the country, but 
Howard's main contribution has been in providing the environment for the 
artistic process at this point," said Sterner. 
</P>
<P>
None of the principals have made themselves available to the press. "They're 
very much in the artistic process. That's where the focus is right now," 
Sterner said. 
</P>
<P>
All the dancers will remain in Yulee until the end of August, when Morris and 
his Monnaie Dance Group, which is based in Brussels, will begin touring the 
United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Morris is due in Los Angeles Sept. 3 to address the Dance Critics Assn. 
conference at Cal State Los Angeles.

DELTA BURKE RETURNS PRODUCERS' FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: IN A FOUR-PAGE COMMENTARY, ACTRESS ALLEGES ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR ON THE 
SET OF "DESIGNING WOMEN." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delta Burke, who plays the feisty Suzanne Sugarbaker on "Designing Women," 
issued a feisty counterattack Thursday in the war of words being waged with her 
producers in the news media, charging them with abusive and insulting behavior 
toward her. But she said that she will report to work when production resumes 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Burke's four pages of comment, released through her publicist, Annett Wolf, 
amounted to a fervent, point-by-point rebuttal to last week's angry statement 
by the CBS series' executive producers, Harry Thomason and Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason, about the actress' allegedly churlish behavior on the set. 
They in turn were responding to an interview with Burke in her hometown 
Orlando, Fla., Sentinel, in which she said that she hadn't "wanted to be there 
(on the show) for some time now. It is not a good workplace, not a good 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The actress didn't specify her complaints but the producers appeared to take it 
all to mean that she wanted off the series and said that if she didn't show up, 
she "won't be allowed to work anywhere else until 1992" because her contract 
has two seasons to go. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said Thursday that she never had any intention of leaving the series. 
Publicist Wolf said that Burke had sent letters to both CBS and Columbia 
Pictures Television, which underwrites the series, affirming that she will be 
returning to work. Spokesmen for both companies declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Burke confirmed that she's been "unhappy with working 
conditions on the series." She said that the cast and crew have "generally been 
very supportive of me and they have my public acknowledgement and thanks for 
that. . . . But I have not received that support from the Thomasons." 
</P>
<P>
She cited the Thomason statement last week as evidence and said that 
Bloodworth-Thomason had described the statement as having been designed to 
"verbally annihilate and assassinate Delta." Wolfe said that this comment had 
been made to a Burke representative. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodworth-Thomason, who created "Designing Women" and has written most of the 
episodes, told The Times that on behalf of the six producers on the show and 
"the entire crew," she would stick by the original statement. She said that the 
latest Burke comments were "a complete untruth" except for a reference to 
Thomason yelling on the set. 
</P>
<P>
She said that her husband has yelled on the set on occasion and referred to one 
alleged disrupting of a shoot by Burke for which Thomason came to the set from 
his hospital bed, in his gown, and got an ovation from the crew. 
</P>
<P>
As for Monday's return to work on "Designing Women" and Burke's role in the 
series, she said, "It will be work as usual." 
</P>
<P>
As timing would have it, the verbal warfare erupted just as Burke was being 
nominated for an Emmy for best actress in a comedy series, the first such honor 
for any of the four women stars on the four-year-old series. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said that she's proud of the show: "During our first season, I gave up 
all my free days, weekends and weeks off to promote 'Designing Women,' 
sometimes doing three to five public appearances in a day. When the fate of the 
show was in jeopardy, I cancelled my Christmas vacation to go on the road and 
do talk shows and interviews, asking the public to write in and save the show." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement last week, Thomason had referred to production having been 
shut down for three days on the final episode last season "because Delta said 
that twirling a baton violated her dignity." Burke fired back that "production 
has never been shut down nor delayed because of me" and said that she had no 
objection to the baton -- "I'd even twirled one at Linda's request at hers and 
Harry's wedding" -- but "I wanted to choreograph and rehearse the baton scene 
sometime before performing it cold before an audience and cameras." 
</P>
<P>
Time was lost only because "an incomplete script was delivered on a Wednesday 
to be shot the following night. Thanks to an incredible cast and crew, this 
episode finally got done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Burke complained that some scripts were written about "my various personal 
problems" without her approval and said that when she received a death threat, 
an additional guard was placed at the sound stage, "despite 
Bloodworth-Thomason's ridicule of my fear." Then in the next week's script, her 
character Suzanne received a death threat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Burke's weight gains, which have been noted with fierce regularity in 
the tabloid press, Thomason had said that very few producers would say "no 
problem" when stars show up "having undergone such a substantial weight gain, 
when they were hired to play a beauty queen." 
</P>
<P>
Burke said that the producers had never been so accepting; in the first season, 
she said, she was told over and over that she had a weight problem, and in the 
second season she was "threatened with dismissal." 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been my understanding," the actress said, "that the character is 
a former beauty queen and has been since the pilot. I am also a former beauty 
queen (Miss Florida) and, coincidentally enough, both Suzanne and I held our 
last titles 16 years ago. Over a 16-year period, things happen, even to former 
beauty queens. 
</P>
<P>
"After much personally hurtful publicity, Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason saw fit to 
take advantage of an idea that I brought to her and helped develop, which 
became (the episode titled) 'They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?,' of which we 
are all duly proud." 
</P>
<P>
Thomason, who directed most of the episodes, was nominated for an Emmy for that 
show. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in his statement, Thomason had referred to "several run-ins with 
Delta." The actress described one of these when "Mr. Thomason assembled the 
entire cast in his office and began one of his tirades, accusing us all of 
being ungrateful, screaming at us in a threatening manner, throwing things at 
us, and when I refused to accept this abuse and attempted to leave the room, he 
physically blocked my way from the door until he decided to allow me to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"This abusive behavior continued until Mr. Thomason learned that my fiance was 
on the way." 
</P>
<P>
The fiance, now husband, was Gerald McRaney,, star of the series "Major Dad," 
also on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Thomason also maintained that his wife had never said a cross word to Burke. 
Burke countered that Bloodworth-Thomason "insulted me on numerous occasions, 
accused me and other cast members of ingratitude, repeatedly told me that 
neither I nor any other cast member was necessary for the continued success of 
'Designing Women,' and falsely stated to the press and cast that I had been 
suspended from the show."

'JAKES' MAY BOOST 'CHINATOWN' RENTALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The release of "The Two Jakes," the further adventures of private eye J. J. 
Gittes, is expected to prompt renewed interest at home-video stores in the film 
it follows, "Chinatown," which came out in 1974 and has been available on 
cassette since 1979. Many who have seen "Jakes" contend that seeing the 
original first will help moviegoers better understand and appreciate the new 
film. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Home Video has not planned a special promotion of "Chinatown," but 
individual stores apparently will do so, as indicated by the requests to 
Paramount from various retailers for "Chinatown" promotional materials, such as 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
"When these sequels come out, there's often renewed interest in the original 
movies," said Music Plus marketing executive Angie Diehl. "Stores do order more 
copies in anticipation of this new demand." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when the "Back to the Future" sequels hit theaters, MCA/Universal 
was able to sell additional copies of the original to retailers and 
distributors. It helped that the consensus was that the sequels made more sense 
after seeing the first one. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating that "Two Jakes" would be released last December, Paramount had 
advertised last fall that it was dropping the price of "Chinatown" from $24.95 
to $19.95. But the release of "Two Jakes" was delayed, so the promotion effort 
was wasted. DENNIS HUNT

HOME TECH / VIDEO: RENTAL PRICE INCREASE ON THE HORIZON; 
</P>
<P>
VIDEOCASSETTES: RETAILERS FEAR HIKE WILL SCARE AWAY CONSUMERS, BUT THEY'LL DO 
IT ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
For consumers, the most important news to come out of the Video Software 
Dealers Assn. convention, a four-day affair that ended Wednesday, is that a 
rental price increase is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers had come to the annual home-video industry gathering in Las 
Vegas hoping that some manufacturers might announce their intention not to 
raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
Just wishful thinking, it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing that happened at the convention indicated there will be a lid on the 
wholesale price rises that have been plaguing retailers, which means rental 
prices most certainly will be creeping up by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"With the country facing a recession, the fastest way to lose customers is to 
hit them with a price rise," said convention chairman Mitch Lowe, a retailer 
from Mill Valley, Calif. "But many retailers won't have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, a new standard retail price for rental titles surfaced: 
$92.95, up from last year's $89.95. But retailers fear that Paramount's $100 
for "The Hunt for Red October" -- due out in October -- will trigger an even 
higher standard. 
</P>
<P>
With the retailers faced with higher inventory costs, the ultimate loser is the 
consumer, insisted retailer Brad Burnside of Video Adventure in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"The retailer could pass the higher costs on to the consumer in terms of a 
higher rental rate, so the consumer loses there," he suggested. "The retailer 
can eat the higher cost, but that means he can't afford to buy as many copies 
of that hot new title. The consumer loses there too because he can't get the 
rental he wants when he wants it. 
</P>
<P>
"Or the retailer could deal with higher wholesale costs by not buying as many 
smaller titles -- like travel videos or opera videos. But the customer loses 
there too because he has fewer choices and he loses out on experiencing what 
some of these special-interest videos have to offer. One thing you see at a 
convention like this is an incredible variety of videos. But as wholesale 
prices go up, retailers just can't afford to stock these videos." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it's the small independent retailers -- who make up the bulk of the 
association -- who're going to be hit hardest. "A lot of the small stores won't 
be able to survive this price rise," convention chairman Lowe predicted. 
</P>
<P>
RENTAL STUDY: A study by the research firm Paul Kagan Associates, commissioned 
by the Video Software Dealers Assn. and unveiled at the convention, confirmed 
that the growth rate in cassette rentals has slowed. The rate is projected to 
be 9.4% this year, slipping to 8.5% next year and dipping to 6.6% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The rental business is still growing -- with revenues up 11% in the first 
quarter this year. And the study indicated that retailers' big worry wasn't 
lack of interest from renters but rising costs. Their per-cassette costs have 
risen each year since 1987, which erode profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
LASERDISC: Pioneer, Image and Sony, leading proponents of the laserdisc format, 
had prominent exhibits, all geared to convincing video-minded retailers -- 
particularly those in the Midwest -- to stock laser software. Explained a Sony 
executive: "Most retailers are afraid of laserdiscs. They need a lot of 
education about the format." 
</P>
<P>
Laser boosters were buzzing about a recent hardware announcement that should 
increase the format's national profile. Next month, Radio Shack will market the 
MD-1000, a $500 combination unit that plays five sizes of discs -- including 
CDs and 12-inch laserdiscs. Exposure in this national electronics chain will 
introduce the format to legions of consumers -- particularly in small cities -- 
who now know little about it. 
</P>
<P>
"TRACY" AND "PRETTY WOMAN": Disney's Bill Mechanic, president of theatrical 
distribution and worldwide video, said at the convention that, contrary to 
pre-convention rumors, there were no plans to release "Dick Tracy" on video 
soon. The company wants to give it more time in theaters to gather more 
marketing information. Since the company is releasing "Pretty Woman" Oct. 19, 
it's unlikely to put out a competing blockbuster in the Christmas market. 
</P>
<P>
At $19.99, "Pretty Woman" is being geared to the big discount stores, which 
will probably sell it as low as $15. Traditionally, though, such stores prefer 
to market G and PG titles, not R-rated movies like "Pretty Woman." Earlier this 
year, Warner had trouble selling the violent, R-rated "Lethal Weapon 2" -- 
priced for the sales market -- to discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanic, though, said he expected no resistance to stocking "Pretty Woman," a 
romantic, Cinderella-type story with, he insisted, only one scene that takes it 
out of the PG category.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were shot and wounded early this morning as they argued with the 
occupants of another car while driving on an on-ramp to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Leif Danielson, 22, of Greeley, Colo., was shot in the left foot and Kenneth 
Miller, 22, of Costa Mesa was shot in the left thigh about 2:25 a.m., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both were taken to Los Alamitos Medical Center, said Seal Beach police 
dispatcher Carl Liebold. 
</P>
<P>
Danielson remained in the hospital today after undergoing surgery while Miller 
was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Danielson and Miller were heading onto the southbound lanes of the San Diego 
Freeway at the 7th Street on-ramp when they got into a confrontation with the 
occupants of a late-model red Pontiac Trans-Am, Liebold said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the unidentified occupants in the Pontiac suddenly opened fire, striking 
Danielson and Miller, Liebold said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Danielson and Miller bleeding in their parked car when they 
responded to calls from an unidentified witness. Liebold said police 
investigators did not know the nature of the dispute or whether the victims 
knew the assailants.

<P>
A majority of Arab League nations agreed today to send Arab troops to protect 
Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, approved economic sanctions against Baghdad 
and condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The moves came after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein defiantly called on Arabs 
throughout the Middle East to join in a holy war to sweep from power the Saudi 
royal family and seize the Muslim holy shrines in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League action was by far the strongest Arab step against Hussein since 
the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation reportedly denounced the measures and vowed that Baghdad 
will stand by its annexation of the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
Of 20 Arab League member states present, 12 supported the seven-point 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Libya, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Iraq voted against the 
package, Algeria and Yemen abstained, and Tunis was absent. Three governments 
expressed reservations and took no position. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's representative to the United Nations, Amr Moussa, told reporters that 
details of the deployment of the Arab force will be worked out in contacts 
coordinated by the the league's secretary, Chadli Klibi. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering of Arab presidents and kings had been hastily convened with the 
goal of finding a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf crisis in order to 
stave off foreign intervention. 
</P>
<P>
The approval of the measures came at a closed-door Arab League session that 
quickly turned stormy. 
</P>
<P>
Conference sources said a shouting match broke out between delegations from 
Iraq and the Kuwait government it ousted. During the heated argument, the 
Kuwaiti foreign minister collapsed, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's ousted emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, whose family ruled Kuwait 
for more than 230 years, was present for the morning session. He sat two 
delegations over from a grim-faced Taha Yassin Ramadan, head of the Iraqi 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two pool reporters allowed in the meeting hall said the 62-year-old 
emir looked "terribly depressed. He looked as though he was near collapse." 
</P>
<P>
Before the afternoon session, the emir returned to Saudi Arabia, his home in 
exile. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's defiant call to take back the Muslim shrines signaled that his 
intentions are broader than the annexation of Kuwait. His rhetoric aimed at 
presenting himself as a champion of Arabs and Muslims everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
By inviting U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia, the Saudi leaders "are not 
only defying the Arab and Islamic nations . . . but are challenging God the day 
they put Mecca and the tomb of Mohammed under the grip of the foreigner," 
Hussein said in a statement read by a spokesman on television. 
</P>
<P>
"Your brothers in Iraq are determined on holy war, without hesitation and 
without any slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
"We shall be victorious, God willing, and evil and corruption will be trampled 
wherever it is, the sun will rise on the Arabs and the Muslims and God will be 
happy after we purify our souls and land from the foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
His mention of foreigners was a clear reference to American and other Western 
forces in the region.

"His feet were up in the air, and the rest of his body was completely covered," 
Yagoda said. "The firemen couldn't use heavy equipment because they were afraid 
of injuring him. It took an hour to completely free him from the trench."

Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's 2-week-old government appealed for calm 
today after a drastic austerity plan was met with shantytown lootings and 
protests in which security forces killed four people. 
</P>
<P>
Police opened fire on a mob of about 100 people looting a food warehouse in the 
northern city of Trujillo overnight, killing one man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
He was the latest victim of the backlash to the new austerity package. 
</P>
<P>
The austerity program, announced Wednesday night, included a 3,100% boost in 
gasoline prices, huge price increases in food staples and sweeping exchange and 
foreign trade reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Transport was paralyzed across the country for the second day in a row today as 
bus companies demanded the government boost fares to match the gasoline price 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
Most economists praised the plan as tough but necessary to rescue the state's 
bankrupt finances, but it sparked a rash of protests and lootings at shantytown 
food markets where security forces killed three people Thursday and injured 
four others. 
</P>
<P>
"Some adverse reactions . . . are absolutely normal, but we call . . . on the 
population to have patience and stay calm," Labor Minister Carlos Torres said 
in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
Lima appeared to be calm today. But crowds of people in at least three other 
cities swept through markets overnight stealing food, police and radio reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Supermarket owners posted armed guards at their doors, and most small 
shopkeepers closed for fear of looting or because they had no idea what to 
charge.

DEPLOYMENT: ANALYSTS ESTIMATE THAT THE U.S. WILL SPEND AT LEAST $300 MILLION A

Deploying U.S. forces to protect Saudi Arabia and its oil will cost the United 
States at least $300 million a month with not a shot fired, military analysts 
estimated today. 
</P>
<P>
But if shooting does start, the cost could triple or quadruple in short order, 
said retired Rear Adm. Gene R. La Rocque, director of the Center for Defense 
Information, a private research center. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long the U.S. military will be committed, with Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney saying this week: "We don't know how long it will last. 
We don't know when it will end." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials said they cannot give an estimate of the potential cost 
of the Persian Gulf operation, which the Pentagon has dubbed Operation Desert 
Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials said the number of troops to be committed to the 
region includes elements of the 18th, 82nd and 101st airborne divisions and a 
mechanized infantry division, and the aircraft include two tactical fighter 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
La Rocque based his $300-million-a-month estimate on the United States sending 
50,000 troops and three aircraft carrier groups with fighter planes to the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis Cain, research director of the Defense Budget Project, a private study 
group, put his cost estimate at $1 billion to $3 billion over six months. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on a number of things -- how many go, how long they stay and what 
they end up doing," he said. "But if (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein's tank 
armies come across the desert, then the cost will be much more." 
</P>
<P>
Defense analysts say it is difficult to estimate costs of the Saudi operation, 
since both the exact makeup of the U.S. contingent and its expected length of 
stay remain unknown. 
</P>
<P>
But they cited several previous military deployments for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials put the cost of operations in the "Tanker War" of 1987 -- 
when U.S. warships escorted Kuwaiti tankers through the Persian Gulf -- at $3 
million a day. 
</P>
<P>
A major incident then involved the guided-missile cruiser Stark, hit by an 
Exocet missile fired by an Iraqi jet that killed 37 American sailors.

SKINNER SEEKS AIRLINE TALKS ON FUEL COSTS

<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner is calling in airline executives to 
discuss the impact of sharp rises in jet fuel prices that led nearly every 
major carrier to announce fare increases. 
</P>
<P>
Some increases went into effect today, but passengers on most airlines have 
until next Wednesday to book flights in advance at current fares. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner wrote to several airline presidents Thursday, asking them to make 
appointments with him next Wednesday, Thursday or Friday to discuss how higher 
jet fuel prices since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are affecting airline 
finances and the public. 
</P>
<P>
Delta, United and USAir all announced 5.3% fare increases Thursday that are to 
take effect in five days. Several other airlines announced increases earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest dropped a planned $8-per-flight fuel surcharge, announcing a 10% fare 
increase instead. American scaled back its increase from 10% to 5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Other airlines that have announced increases include America West, Midway, Pan 
Am, Southwest, Trans World and the Trump Shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation Daily, which monitors the industry, said today that Trans World and 
Pan Am are likely to reduce announced 10% fare increases because none of their 
foreign competitors are immediately raising their prices. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of jet fuel shot up from a level of 70 or 75 cents a gallon before the 
invasion to 80 to 90 cents this week, airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The government has no power to regulate fuel prices or airline fares, but 
Skinner had earlier asked all transportation companies to show restraint in 
raising rates in response to increasing fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the effect of the rise in fuel costs, both on the 
financial position of the industry and on the traveling public," Skinner said 
in a two-paragraph letter to several airline presidents. He asked the officials 
to brief him on the situation.

Nordstrom Inc., saddled with labor problems the last year, reported a 10% 
increase in second-quarter sales and a 7% drop in earnings from the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
The upscale retailer reported sales for the quarter ended July 31 of $801.7 
million, up from $729 million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
But profits dropped to $35.9 million, or 44 cents a share, from $38.5 million, 
or 47 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
Profits for the first half of 1990 were down 20%, to $49 million, from the 
$61.5 million reported for the first six months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales over the first six months increased 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Tashjian, a stock analyst with Seidler Amdec in Los Angeles, said Nordstrom 
sales in stores open for a year or more slowed to a 3% growth rate, about half 
what he estimated the company expected. 
</P>
<P>
Results from the company's annual anniversary sale held in July were 
"substantially short of expectations," Tashjian said.

BORDERS: NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC DECIDES TO PRINT AN ATLAS SHOWING A UNITED GERMANY

The National Geographic Society printed pages of a new world atlas that shows 
East and West Germany united, but delayed printing the Middle East map because 
of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
R. R. Donnelly &amp; Sons in Willard, Ohio, printed 240,000 pages containing 
the map of a unified Germany that will be in the sixth edition of the National 
Geographic Atlas of the World even though the unification is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
The new 410-page atlas will be available in November. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to look into our crystal ball and see that the unification of 
Germany is inevitable," said John Garver, National Geographic's chief mapmaker. 
"However, it was not without much hand-wringing and deliberation that we 
decided to change the world before it actually happened." 
</P>
<P>
Both Bonn and Berlin will be shown as the capitals, and only the West German 
flag will be shown. Germany also will be unified on 21 other maps, such as 
regional, political and world maps, Garver said. 
</P>
<P>
Germany will be surrounded with a green border and the red line that has 
separated East and West Germany in previous editions of the atlas will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Garver ordered the map of the Middle East to be printed last -- 
probably in two weeks -- because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to hold that until the latest we possibly can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garver said there was little chance Kuwait would be eliminated from the map. 
</P>
<P>
Unless something else significant occurs, he said, the Middle East map will 
contain the following notation: "On Aug. 2, 1990, Iraqi military forces invaded 
Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
The atlas also dropped the letters "S.S.R.," which stands for Soviet Socialist 
Republic, from Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia and other Soviet republics except 
for Russia because of independence movements there.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will test honey after some in 
Massachusetts was found with 22 times the legal amount of pesticide, it was 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Officials identified two large beekeeping operations which allegedly misused 
the chemical, fluvalinate, in hives used to pollinate cranberry bogs in 
Massachusetts, the Boston Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors found fluvalinate in honey taken from hives owned by one of the 
companies. The company sells honey to the public as well as to the federal 
government, which gives it to schools and senior citizen centers. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Hamilton Jr., compliance director for the FDA in Boston, said the 
agency is concerned that dozens of beekeepers who travel between Florida and 
New England pollinating everything from citrus groves to apple orchards may be 
misusing the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether this is (in) food for human consumption or not at this 
point, so we are actively investigating it and we will begin testing the honey 
that is sold for human consumption," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fluvalinate, which is legal for use in hives which do not produce honey, is 
used to kill the varroa mite, which kills bees.

What would seem an idea right out of "Mission Impossible" -- a one-hour 
recapitulation of last season's many plot twists on "Twin Peaks" -- has been 
canceled, ABC said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
ABC originally planned to air on Sept. 29 a show that would have recapped 
important points in the surreal saga of sex, murder and doughnuts in a small 
logging hamlet in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
The series now is in summer repeats. 
</P>
<P>
But the network and the show's makers, Lynch-Frost Productions, mutually agreed 
to call off the special and concentrate all their energy on the show's second 
season, said ABC spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks" will begin its second season with a two-hour Sunday broadcast on 
Sept. 30, then appear regularly on Saturday nights.

Folk singer Arlo Guthrie says it's ridiculous to put labels on records warning 
that the lyrics may be offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that people can spend their time thinking about all that stuff when 
there are disasters going on all around us is kind of silly, I think," Guthrie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "The fear of music is more harmful than bad music." 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie, the son of folk legend Woody Guthrie, is known for his hits "Alice's 
Restaurant" and "City of New Orleans." He was scheduled for a concert tonight 
at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Recording Industry Assn. of America unveiled a voluntary "parental 
guidance" label for recordings that might be deemed objectionable because of 
lyrics dealing with such themes as sex, violence, suicide or drugs.

A British rock band and its record company should pay up to $5 million in 
damages to a young fan who allegedly was spurred to enter a suicide pact by 
subliminal words hidden in the group's music, an attorney argued today. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian Lynch, representing the family of James Vance, also charged in her 
closing arguments that a multitrack original of the song "Better by You, Better 
Than Me," by the heavy metal band Judas Priest was altered before it was 
presented to the court as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"If this trial does nothing else than prevent the use of subliminals in mass 
communications, then this trial will be a success," Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
She urged Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead, who is hearing the case 
without a jury, to award damages of $4 million to $5 million to Vance's family 
to repay nearly $500,000 in medical bills and to compensate for pain and 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments in the four-week-old trial were to continue into the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehead will then decide whether the alleged subliminal messages exist and, 
if so, whether they promoted the youths to shoot themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the heavy metal group contend that no covert words exist in the 1978 
"Stained Class" album. 
</P>
<P>
The families of Vance and Raymond Belknap that backward and subliminal messages 
on the album contain blasphemy and promote suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap, 18, died of a single blast from a shotgun held in his mouth two days 
before Christmas, 1985. Vance, then 20, blew away the lower portion of his 
face. He fathered a child and lived three years before his death on 
Thanksgiving Day, 1988.

Film star Gerard Depardieu was fined $1,800, and his license was suspended for 
six months for driving while drunk. He was arrested after a car accident that 
injured two people. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu, who won best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival this year for 
his title role in "Cyrano de Bergerac," was also sentenced this week to a 
two-month suspended prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu, 41, did not attend the court proceeding in Riom. His lawyer, Serge 
Teillot, said the actor "fully acknowledged his responsibility" but felt the 
proceedings would be more calm if he did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Depardieu's blood contained twice the legal alcohol limit of 
0.08% after the July 20 accident, which occurred as the actor drove to a hotel 
after shooting scenes for a new movie. 
</P>
<P>
His car collided with another on a country road near Puy-de-Dome, slightly 
injuring the wife and daughter of the other driver. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu told police he was trying to answer a call on his car telephone and 
was blinded by the setting sun when the crash occurred.

Happily-ever-after endings are found in some of the novels of best-selling 
author Belva Plain, but not always in her personal life. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge on Thursday banned Plain's 44-year-old son, John, from 
contacting her or going within four blocks of the homes of his mother and 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas P. Zampino said his ruling did not endorse the conduct of the 
74-year-old Plain, author of a string of best sellers including "Evergreen" and 
"Blessing." But he also said he could not force a mother-child relationship on 
the pair. 
</P>
<P>
John Plain has not been allowed in his mother's home since age 14, when he was 
sent to a succession of boarding schools and institutions. Plain's efforts 
during the past few years to meet his mother and siblings included repeated 
telephone calls and picketing outside their Short Hills home.

Ben Johnson got the green light from the Canadian government to return to 
competition, but his eligibility for teams sanctioned by the Canadian Olympic 
Assn. has not been determined, the association said today. 
</P>
<P>
The COA, which has jurisdiction over Canadian participation in the Olympics and 
the Pan American Games, said in a news release that it reserves the right to 
extend any suspension imposed by national or international federations. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was barred by track's world governing body and the Canadian association 
after he tested positive for steroids at the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Sport Minister Marcel Danis announced Thursday that although the 
government's lifetime ban on funding to the Toronto sprinter would remain in 
effect, any decision on competitive sanctions would rest with the sport's 
national governing body, Athletics Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's two-year suspension from international competition ends Sept. 24, and 
Athletics Canada says he will be welcomed back, provided he meets team 
qualifying standards. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ratcliffe, communications manager for the Canadian Olympic Assn., said in 
an interview that although the COA will not necessarily extend the suspension 
when its executive committee meets next month in Toronto, it reserves the right 
to do so.

STEINBRENNER WANTS TO REVISE SANCTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: COMMISSIONER VINCENT INDICATES HIS ANGER AT THE POSITION AND SAYS HE 
WON'T CHANGE ANY PART OF THEIR AGREEMENT.

George Steinbrenner wants a revision of some aspects of Commissioner Fay 
Vincent's sanctions. Steinbrenner believes the written agreement does not match 
the one he agreed to with Vincent in the commissioner's office July 30, 
according to two sources in Steinbrenner's camp. 
</P>
<P>
But Vincent indicated Thursday night that he is angered by Steinbrenner's 
posturing and that he will not alter any portion of their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I will adhere to the agreement," Vincent said. "The agreement between Mr. 
Steinbrenner and myself stands. That is what I intend. I am absolutely against 
redoing the agreement. And it seems to me they are looking for a major 
renegotiation. I will not do that." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner has moved for a restructuring of the agreement's language because, 
among other things, he has apparently been stunned in recent days by the 
prospect that his son Hank may not receive enough support from the 25 other 
major-league owners to be approved as his successor as Yankees general partner. 
In that case, controlling interest of the franchise would fall out of the 
Steinbrenner family. 
</P>
<P>
"George thought he was willing to step down to a limited partner only if his 
son would (automatically) replace him," Vincent said. "That is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, though Vincent said he would approve of Hank Steinbrenner, the 
agreement says the Yankees' choice to replace George as general partner is 
"subject to the subsequent approval of the major-league clubs." Steinbrenner 
signed that document. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent indicated that Steinbrenner is also trying to redo the sanctions as 
they pertain to: 
</P>
<P>
* Reinstatement. Persons placed on the permanently ineligible list, such as 
Pete Rose, may apply for reinstatement one year after being placed on that 
list. But the Steinbrenner agreement says the owner "will be treated, for all 
purposes, as if he were on the ineligible list although he will not actually be 
placed on" that list. Steinbrenner thought he could apply for reinstatement, 
but because he is not on the ineligible list, Vincent said, there is no 
provision for that action. 
</P>
<P>
* His attendance at major-league games. Vincent banned Steinbrenner from 
major-league parks and spring-training facilities, though Steinbrenner can 
purchase a ticket or seek written approval from Vincent. Steinbrenner, Vincent 
indicated, is seeking to rework that sanction, too. 
</P>
<P>
* Tax consequences. Steinbrenner has tried to include language that his lawyers 
claim would protect him against unintended tax burdens as a result of his 
switch to being a limited partner. Vincent sees no basis for that argument. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner became subject to the sanctions because the commissioner 
determined that he had paid gambler Howard Spira to furnish information on 
ex-Yankee Dave Winfield, who was embroiled in a dispute with Steinbrenner over 
his Winfield Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent already has warned Steinbrenner once that he should not test the 
agreement.

Miami Dolphins rookie fullback Leroy Holt will miss the 1990 season with a 
fractured vertebra at the base of his neck, but he says the injury could have 
been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a blessed man," said the 5-10, 224-pounder from USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors told me I would have been paralyzed if I was a little scrawny guy. I 
had a big (spinal-cord) canal. Thank God." 
</P>
<P>
The hairline fracture, between Holt's fourth and fifth vertebra, is such that 
doctors Thursday assured him his career has not ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play again," he said. "I had prepared for the worst." 
</P>
<P>
Holt was injured July 31 when he clashed head-on with linebacker John Offerdahl 
during a drill. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three months, Holt will wear a bulky collar-brace that extends up 
the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins' fifth-round draft pick had earned praise from Coach Don Shula 
during training camp and appeared likely to make the final roster.

<P>
Taylor Garrison Belcher, a career Foreign Service officer who was U.S. 
ambassador to Cyprus and Peru in the 1960s and '70s, has died of cancer at a 
hospital here. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher, who retired in 1974 to nearby Garrison, N.Y., was 70 when he died 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher was a veteran of State Department service and stationed in Cyprus when 
President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 appointed him envoy to that then-divided 
nation following the eruption of violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. 
Earlier, he had been consul in Nicosia in 1957 and counsel general a year 
later, remaining there until 1960. He had returned as an untitled Foreign 
Service officer until his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
As ambassador, Belcher -- a quiet mediator -- was credited with helping break 
the centuries-old pattern of violence between the Greek majority and Turk 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969 he left Cyprus for Lima, where he helped shape an agreement that 
resolved a lengthy dispute over compensation for expropriated American 
properties seized after a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
After retirement, Belcher returned to Upstate New York, where his family had 
been members of the original settlement of Garrison-on-Hudson, operating a 
ferry service to West Point.
