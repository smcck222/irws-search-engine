<TEXT>
<P>
A 52-year-old career letter carrier, described as a model employee and as 
"mellow and friendly as could be," shot his wife to death Thursday morning, 
then drove about half a mile to work, where he shot and killed two co-workers 
and wounded a third before shooting himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified by police as John Merlin Taylor, was on life support 
systems at Palomar Medical Center and described by authorities as "brain dead." 
The weapon for his rampage was a .22-caliber semi-automatic pistol that police 
said he reloaded at least once during the outburst as some co-workers ran for 
safety and others stood, frozen in fear. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Taylor took a box of 100 bullets and two ammunition clips with him 
to the city's Orange Glen postal station but apparently fired only 15 to 20 
rounds before shooting himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Motive Known 
</P>
<P>
Neither police nor postal employees could offer an explanation for the rampage. 
"We do not have a motive," said Escondido Police Chief Vincent Jimno. "That's 
been real uncomfortable for us. We don't have anything to hang our hat on. We 
know who, we know where, we know when, we just don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's shooting evoked memories of other shootings at post offices around 
the country -- including the suicide in March of postal carrier Donald Mace, 
who walked into the lobby of the Poway Post Office and shot himself, and of the 
August, 1986, massacre in Edmond, Okla., where a part-time postal carrier shot 
and killed 14 co-workers before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike those incidents -- in which the gunmen were openly disgruntled with 
their work -- there was no immediate explanation for Taylor's outburst at the 
Orange Glen postal station in the 1700 block of East Valley Parkway, which 
serves the eastern part of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Co-workers and neighbors described Taylor, a 27-year postal veteran, as a 
content if not eager worker who enjoyed a happy home life as well -- tainted 
perhaps only by frustrations brought on by a 22-year-old stepson who reportedly 
recently moved in with the Taylors, both on their second marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was uniformly described by co-workers as affable and mellow, and by 
neighbors as a decent fellow who took pleasure in his perfectly manicured lawn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Neighbor 
</P>
<P>
"John would come outside, work on his lawn, drink a beer and talk to his 
neighbors, and she would be inside taking care of the house," said Barbara 
Pinto, who has lived next door to the Taylors since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Thursday, Taylor put on his blue postal uniform and showed up at his 
workplace at 7:35 a.m. -- armed with a Sturm-Ruger semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have any emotion. He was stern-faced," said co-worker William 
Karlson, one of about 10 employees inside the building when the shooting 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Taylor had shot his 50-year-old wife, Elizabeth, according to 
Escondido police, who found her body in bed at the couple's home in the 900 
block of Begonia Street. She had been shot twice in the head and police 
recovered two bullet casings that matched those found at the post office. She 
was dressed in night clothes and covered to her waist with a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor arrived at the post office, he approached co-workers Richard Berni, 
38, of San Marcos, and Ronald H. Williams, 56, of Escondido -- men who had 
probably assumed that Taylor, as was his habit, was getting to work early so he 
could join them on the loading-dock picnic table for their morning coffee and a 
smoke before clocking in at 8 a.m. for his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
This time he shot them both dead, then entered the side door of the building, 
shooting at some, not at others. He shot co-worker Paul DeRisi, 30, in the 
upper left arm, reloaded, and sprayed still more bullets inside the building, 
but passed by others without harming them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shot Went Through My Arm' 
</P>
<P>
"I walked back to check on someone and John Taylor walked through the side 
door," DeRisi said. "I said, 'Good morning,' and then I heard a pop. I noticed 
he had a gun in his hand and the second shot went through my arm." 
</P>
<P>
DeRisi said he didn't realize he had been shot until he felt the blood on his 
left arm. "I took off for the front door and another bullet passed by me," he 
said. "I ran next door to a restaurant and told them to call the police. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I sat down outside and said to myself, 'Why John Taylor? Why is he doing 
this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Another postal worker, Phyllis DeVito, 37, injured her face when she fell as 
she tried to escape the chaos. She was treated at Palomar Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The post office had opened to the public for business at 7 a.m. but apparently 
the only ones in the building at the time were the 10 postal workers, some of 
whom had gotten to work early. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had recently completed an extended term as president of the North San 
Diego County local of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Berni was a five-year veteran of the Postal Service, authorities said. He had 
recently moved from Albuquerque with his wife, Pamela, and three children. He 
was active as a Little League coach. His youngest son, Christian, is just 5 
months old. 
</P>
<P>
"His kids were his life," said Norma Vega, a family friend. "He was always 
happy, always ready and willing to help others. He was a kid himself." 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived at the scene moments after being called and discovered the 
carnage. Employees who escaped the shooting inside gathered outdoors and were 
met by co-workers still arriving for work; about 63 workers would have been on 
duty at 8 a.m. -- just 25 minutes after the shooting. Instead, they gathered in 
small knots and, for the most part, declined to talk to reporters. Some hugged 
each other; others cried. 
</P>
<P>
Three counselors were quickly dispatched by the Postal Service to the scene and 
immediately began sessions with some of the traumatized workers. 
</P>
<P>
Postal supervisors suspended mail delivery for the day to the about 25,000 
addresses served by the station. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' wife, Arlene, said she got word of the shooting from her 
daughter-in-law, who heard about it on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headed to Shooting Scene 
</P>
<P>
"I waited to hear from him, and I didn't," she said. "I tried to call the post 
office, but I couldn't get through. Then, I thought I'd better head over there 
and find out for myself. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got there, nobody would look at me or tell me anything, and I began to 
get suspicious." Authorities finally broke the news to her. "I'm just 
grateful," she said, "that they hadn't suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Williams said her husband looked to Taylor as a role model. "My husband 
always admired him. He didn't have anything against John," she said. "I don't 
think John had anything against him, either." 
</P>
<P>
DeRisi felt the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, everybody thought he was the ideal carrier," DeRisi said 
about the man who shot him. "Even the people on his route. People knew him on a 
first-name basis, and that's just the way carriers should be." 
</P>
<P>
There was widespread speculation about what provoked Taylor's outburst, ranging 
from job pressures to domestic problems. Although friends said Taylor was not a 
complainer, he made a comment to co-workers Wednesday night indicating growing 
frustration with a job from which he was within three years of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"Wednesday night, when he went home, he made some comment about how there's not 
enough mail here," said one co-worker who asked not to be identified. "But he 
was being sarcastic, because there was a ton of mail in there." 
</P>
<P>
"None of this figures," he said. "He knew those people -- he'd sit out with 
them each morning and chat with them. He could have shot me just as easily." 
</P>
<P>
Others dismissed any notion that Taylor had suffered burn-out on the job. "He's 
probably the friendliest employee in there," Karlson said. "He never voiced a 
complaint. The rest of us, we'd bitch, but this guy was too nice to bitch about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Williams, the postmaster overseeing Escondido's two post offices, said: 
</P>
<P>
"He was well-liked by management, staff and fellow employees. I never knew him 
to have a short word with anybody." In fact, Taylor was recently selected for a 
quarterly performance award -- but declined the honor and asked that it be 
given to someone else, since he had won it several times before. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Postmaster Margaret Sellers, who arrived at the scene shortly after 
the shooting, said, "This is a model station, and he was a model employee." 
</P>
<P>
Co-worker Johnny Sims said that, on Tuesday, there was discussion among postal 
carriers -- including Taylor -- about the Aug. 20, 1986, shooting when a 
part-time letter carrier, Patrick Sherrill, walked into the Edmond, Okla., post 
office and shot and killed 14 co-workers before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking about something and got around to saying, 'What if something 
happened to one of the employees that would have gotten him mad and to go 
berserk?' " Sims said. "We were just joking around. John was a happy-go-lucky 
guy always. You could never make him mad." 
</P>
<P>
Some fellow letter carriers said Taylor was grumbling recently that his 
22-year-old stepson was not working and had moved in with him and his wife. 
Indeed, there was concern for the whereabouts of the stepson, who was Elizabeth 
Taylor's son by her first marriage. Taylor has five grown children from his 
first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
His stepson apparently heard of the shooting on his car radio and drove to the 
scene, not sure whether his stepfather was involved, Lt. Earl Callander said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Jimno, however, downplayed the significance of Taylor's dispute with his 
stepson and referred to the problem only as an "increased paranoia" on Taylor's 
part. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the Taylors were equally disbelieving Thursday morning as the 
commotion at the local post office spilled over into their quiet, older 
neighborhood and police cordoned off the couple's one-story, brown wood home. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, police found a clean and well-kept house, Jimno said. No notes were 
found, nor any other weapons or ammunition -- although police were waiting for 
a formal search warrant before they went through the house thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of a struggle, Jimno said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Meyers, 16, who lives next door to the Taylors, said the couple seemed to 
enjoy a happy marriage, punctuated by rare arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Don Sceville, who helped the couple remodel their kitchen, 
said Taylor had a temper that was frequently set off by his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a cute gal," he said, "a real nice personality, but she did nag him. 
She was always into him for something . . . but he did love her, there's no 
doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
Pinto, the next-door neighbor, said: "They were very friendly, a nice couple. 
They had a lot of friends. They went out dancing, and they had people over. I 
don't know why this would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Pinto said Mrs. Taylor, who worked in the jewelry department at the Montgomery 
Ward Focus store in Escondido, "was the talker, and he (Taylor) was the 
listener. She could talk to anybody. I know they loved each other very much. He 
called her 'Poopsie.' "

If a New Yorker had seen it, he would have thought he had died and gone to 
heaven. There they were, at least 200 cabs without passengers driving through 
downtown Los Angeles during rush hour Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The independent cab drivers circled the streets around City Hall, honking for 
almost an hour to protest the city's proposal to levy stiff fines against 
drivers who are discourteous, overcharge passengers or otherwise provide bad 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Groused Yuri Gizersky, a 10-year veteran of the road, "They want to take food 
out of my family's mouth because I have a little dust on my cab or maybe a tiny 
scratch. So maybe they should all walk." 
</P>
<P>
Even as the cabbies protested, Councilman Joel Wachs was proposing still more 
rules. Wachs wants a dress code outlawing tank tops, wants taxi drivers to 
attend training programs that stress "importance of courteous behavior" and he 
wants drivers to hand out "courtesy cards" to solicit rider comments. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said he developed the proposal after receiving complaints from the 
public. When pressed on just where these complaints were coming from, Wachs 
said, "My mother." 
</P>
<P>
There's something about an Aqua Velva man. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Suellen Governale, who has been spending spare time searching what 
seems by now to be every drug store, shopping mall and grocery store in Los 
Angeles, looking for Aqua Velva's menthol mist shaving lotion for her husband, 
Chuck. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck, a 50-year-old computer magazine writer, even put an ad in the newspaper 
offering to pay $4 a bottle. You see, Beecham Products of Pittsburgh is 
discontinuing the menthol line. He even called the company, begging them to 
keep making it. But they told him that it is not a "big mover." They suggested 
calling distributors. Distributors told him they were sold out. 
</P>
<P>
If Governale sounds a bit desperate, it's because he's been using the lotion 
for more than 30 years. "I don't even like Aqua Velva Blue, and I hate all the 
new lotions. They smell too strong. Musk, yech!" 
</P>
<P>
So far he's gotten three bottles to stockpile. So what's he going to do after 
he uses the last bottles? 
</P>
<P>
"I am seriously thinking of growing a beard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost like in the movies. The runaway train boxcar was barreling down 
the tracks and the lawman maneuvered his trusty steed next to it, hopped on and 
saved the day by applying the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Except this happened in real life to Sgt. Andrew Blodgett. The LAPD motorcycle 
officer was on duty when he heard the radio call about a lumber-filled boxcar 
out of control on tracks in South-Central Los Angeles near Western and Slauson 
avenues. The sergeant saw the car and sped into action. Because he had ridden 
freight trains as a kid and is still a train buff, he knew where the brakes 
would be -- on the back, halfway down the side. But, he added, it wasn't quite 
as romantic as it sounded. "I'm stuck with what really happened," he said, 
explaining that he didn't just jump from his motorcycle to the train ala Tom 
Mix. "I followed the boxcar and when it slowed down going up a rise, I parked 
my motorcycle and then climbed on." 
</P>
<P>
So who says all California kids know how to surf? 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors is holding Surf Camps 
to teach kids ages 12 to 17 how to ride the curl, repair surfboards and be safe 
in the ocean. The sessions, which cost $105, are scheduled from 8 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Aug. 14-18 and Aug. 21-25. Enrollment is first-come, first-served. Jim 
Cole, spokesman for the beaches department, admitting that he had never learned 
how to surf, said wistfully, "I wish they'd had this when I was a kid."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISTRICT ATTORNEY TAKES MOBIL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has taken over prosecution of 
two top-ranking officials at Mobil's Torrance refinery on charges that they 
contributed to the death of a contract worker and the injuries of two others in 
an explosion on July 15, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The case, brought originally by Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord, also names 
three top officials of Cal Cat Chemical Inc. of Benicia. Lord said he asked the 
district attorney to prosecute the case because of new information that could 
elevate the charges from misdemeanors to felony manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said, "The charges are meritless, and we intend 
to defend our position rigorously." 
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred as Cal Cat Chemical employees were treating sludge from 
storage tanks containing water contaminated with sulfur compounds.

A WAY TO PAY THE CLEANUP BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are hundreds of thousands of underground gasoline storage tanks in 
California and some of them are leaking. The cleanups will be messy. They will 
also be costly. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency mandated that every tank owner 
who sells fuel must furnish proof of financial responsibility up to $1 million. 
One million dollars can be a lot of money for the average gas station owner. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the federal regulations were enacted, the expectation was that 
insurance companies would see the market and offer affordable policies to cover 
tank operators in case of a leak. That has not happened. Instead, states across 
the country have had to form their own schemes to pay the cleanup bill. 
</P>
<P>
The standard approach has been to license underground tanks and use the 
licensing fees to form a statewide cleanup fund. California's proposal, SB 299 
sponsored by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), follows this pattern, charging $200 
per license to create a cleanup fund of $24 million. What makes this proposal 
especially attractive is that the bill mandates that small proprietors have 
priority over larger companies, ensuring that the bulk of the fund will go to 
help out the people who need it most. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a similar bill was passed by the Legislature only to be vetoed by the 
governor. The EPA deadline is now only a year away. If the bill fails this 
year, hundreds of convenience stores and mom-and-pop gas stations will miss the 
deadline and may go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing underground storage tanks may not be a guaranteed vote-getter, but it 
is good public policy.

MIDDLE EAST TERRORISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world watched in horror as the pro-Iranian "Party of God" murdered Lt. Col. 
William Higgins, who worked for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon. This 
vicious faction has a long history of similar behavior; it has been involved in 
assassinations, destruction of airliners in flight and the seizure and killing 
of other hostages. It also claimed "credit" for truck bombings that killed our 
Marines in Beirut in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers -- quite erroneously -- have drawn an equivalence between the 
Israeli capture of Sheik Obeid and the seizure of Lt. Col. Higgins. Obeid was 
not a peacekeeper: He commanded assassination brigades. And according to 
international law, such criminals may be seized wherever they are found, even 
on foreign soil. Israel has the same right to act against those who attack its 
citizens and territory as the U.S. had when it bombed Libya in response to 
terrorist attacks against our servicemen in Berlin and when it seized drug 
lords in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Hindsight may make us wish for a different outcome from the seizure of Obeid; 
but we must be careful not to confuse the victims of terrorism with those who 
plan and carry it out.

Last month's Supreme Court decision giving states new authority to restrict 
abortions deepened the concerns of pro-choice advocates that legislatures would 
now bend to the will of those who would repeal all legal access to abortions. 
Such efforts to deny women the right to end unwanted or life-endangering 
pregnancies are certain to occur. There are encouraging indications, however, 
that political support for the pro-choice position may prove to be a lot 
stronger than some had thought. The last five weeks have not seen a rush by 
politicians to embrace the anti-abortion line. Instead, prominent 
office-seekers in a number of key states have chosen to switch to a pro-choice 
position. This week's special primary election for a vacant Assembly seat in a 
conservative San Diego-Riverside County district could encourage that trend. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the special primary, two pro-choice advocates, Republican Tricia 
Hunter and Democrat Jeannine Correia, will face each other in an Oct. 3 runoff 
election. Hunter, the automatic favorite given the district's heavily 
Republican registration, narrowly led a field of six Republicans; she was the 
only abortion rights supporter among her party's candidates. Because this 
election was the first political test of opinion since last month's court 
decision, it drew national attention. 
</P>
<P>
Four other elections later this month, including a legislative contest in South 
Carolina and special congressional elections in Texas and Florida, will 
similarly be watched as indicators of public sentiment on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parade of candidates who have switched sides to endorse the 
pro-choice position grows longer. In Illinois, Neil F. Hartigan and in 
Massachusetts Francis X. Bellotti, both likely Democratic candidates for 
governor and both of whom defended anti-abortion laws in court as their states' 
attorneys general, now say they support a woman's right to choose on abortion. 
In New Jersey, the Republican candidate for governor in the fall election, Rep. 
James A. Courter, has dropped his anti-abortion stand. So has the leading 
Republican candidate for mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
None of this, of course, necessarily signals an irreversible trend. Abortion is 
only one issue among many likely to figure in most elections, and for many 
voters the abortion question is simply not of compelling concern. At the same 
time, though, signs are emerging that the Supreme Court's July ruling won't of 
itself open the way to sweeping legislative curbs on this vital right. This 
week's special Assembly election is encouraging. Other pending elections in 
other states could expand the grounds for optimism that regressive legislative 
actions on abortion can be prevented.

With the Administration having put another $300 billion defense budget on the 
table, it is both frightening and humiliating to realize that we can't protect 
one Marine lieutenant colonel from a gang of thugs. What is the use of 
strategic and tactical weapons and planning for their use if the real threat is 
by terrorists against individual citizens. Are the decision-makers (a term I 
use in only its broadest sense) so enamored by our own technology that we place 
so little value on individuals? 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Lt. Col. Higgins thought about B-2s or cruise missiles as he was 
about to be hanged. If the government feels it's in our best interest to 
participate in a game played out in a corner of the world where ICBMs, SLBMs 
and financial diplomacy mean nothing, I think it's about time that we learn to 
play by the rules of the game. The alternative is the status quo: Our $300 
billion a year defense system undone by $2 worth of rope and a video camera.

DROPS OF MISTRUST CLOUD MALATHION SPRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL BALTER, Michael Balter is a journalist who writes on health and 
environmental issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Medfly, that scourge of California farmers, is back. The trapping of a few 
specimens of the pesky insect in the Elysian Park, Echo Park and Silver Lake 
areas since late July has led to an increasingly familiar chain of events: The 
declaration by the governor of a state of emergency, aerial spraying of the 
pesticide malathion over populated areas, and concern by residents of the 
affected communities about the possible health effects of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, health and agricultural officials quickly attempted to reassure 
residents living in the sprayed zones that malathion poses no danger. Thousands 
of leaflets were distributed, declaring that the pesticide is "considered one 
of the safest insecticides in use today" and that "at this extreme low dose, 
pregnant women have no cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
These days, it seems that there is a strong inverse correlation between the 
certitude with which the experts state that a potentially toxic chemical is 
safe and the degree to which the public feels reassured. One reason is that the 
experts sometimes turn out to be wrong. Over the years, a long list has 
accumulated of pesticides and other chemicals that we once thought were safe 
and now know are dangerous, such as DDT. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of malathion, officials have consistently strained their 
credibility by continuing to overstate the case for the pesticide's safety. In 
fact, serious investigation of malathion's ability to cause genetic damage has 
been under way for only about 10 to 15 years, and the results so far do not at 
all exonerate the chemical. Back in 1976, a comprehensive survey of the 
scientific literature by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health concluded that "information on the mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials 
of malathion is very scanty" and urged that studies of these effects "be 
initiated as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, study after study has shown that malathion is capable of 
causing a variety of types of genetic damage in both human and animal cells. 
For example, researchers at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo found 
that malathion, which is generally considered one of the weaker of its class of 
insecticides, was one of the most potent in causing disruption of the cycle of 
dividing cells. 
</P>
<P>
These findings have given rise to concern that pregnant women exposed to 
malathion might be at higher risk for miscarriages or for giving birth to 
malformed infants. Health and agricultural officials have long argued that the 
doses of malathion received from aerial spraying are too low to cause these 
problems. However, an epidemiological study completed two years ago of San 
Francisco Bay Area residents sprayed with malathion during the 1981-1982 
"Medfly crisis," has left open the possibility that malathion could cause birth 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted jointly by the California Department of Health Services 
and the Department of Preventive Medicine at the USC and compared the outcomes 
of the pregnancies of women who had lived in the spray zones with those who had 
not. Epidemiological studies are notoriously insensitive to relatively small 
effects and are easily biased by other factors that can affect the analysis. 
Nevertheless, after carefully controlling for these errors, the researchers 
found a positive correlation between malathion exposure and stillbirths and a 
significant correlation between exposure and defects of the gastrointestinal 
tract in the newborn children. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the study concluded, however, that although the results were 
"suggestive" of an association with malathion exposure, it was "unlikely" that 
malathion was the cause, in part because the fetal gastrointestinal system was 
already formed by the time the exposure occurred. He may well be right. On the 
other hand, far from giving malathion a clean bill of health, the study only 
raises more questions about the safety of the pesticide -- questions that leave 
us far from the certitude expressed in the public reports of health and 
agricultural officials. 
</P>
<P>
By making exaggerated claims for malathion's safety and by misrepresenting the 
scientific evidence, our officials contribute heavily to the clouds of mistrust 
and anger that trail the helicopters each time they take to the air.

PADRES GETTING TOUGH, BULLY HOUSTON, 13-3 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time, well, just a couple of months ago, when the Padres were 
considered a bunch of nice guys who played a friendly style of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Teams loved coming to this town. Catch a few hours of sun in the late morning 
and early afternoon, maybe even ride a wave or two. Grab a cab to the ballpark. 
Listen to the tranquil fans during batting practice. Play the laid-back Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Intimidating? Come on, not the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, they tried to beat you just like everyone else, but hey, you didn't 
mind so much losing to these guys. Knock you down on the base paths? No way. 
Slide in with spikes flaring at second? Uh-uh. 
</P>
<P>
Why, it was almost as if the Padres were apologetic when they won, making sure 
to wish everyone a nice flight home at the end of each series. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we were too nice before," Padre shortstop Garry Templeton said. "Maybe 
people took us for granted. But you know, I think that's changing. I think 
that's changing fast. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some guys who can intimidate now, guys who are hard-nosed, guys who 
aren't afraid of knocking someone down. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing now is playing some good ol' style baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Astros were the latest to witness the metamorphosis that the Padres 
have undergone Thursday afternoon, leaving town with a 13-3 beating in front of 
16,760 fans at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored seven runs in the first two innings, and even with an 8-1 
lead after three, there was no Mr. Nice Guy to be found. They kept pouring it 
on, scoring three more runs in the sixth and two more in the seventh, 
completing the rout. 
</P>
<P>
The only batter in the lineup who didn't contribute to the offensive bonanza 
was starter Greg Harris (5-6), who was busy shutting down the Astros. Instead 
of easing up, Harris retired 10 of the last 11 batters he faced, and Dan Murphy 
pitched a one-two-three ninth inning in his major-league debut. 
</P>
<P>
You never would have guessed the Padres had a 10-run lead with the way they 
were playing to the last out, with left fielder Bip Roberts running down Eric 
Anthony's fly ball as if it was a tie game in the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
The box score reveals that it was a game in which the Padre hitters got fat off 
Astro pitching, particularly starter Bob Forsch, who has given up 25 hits and 
17 earned runs in his past 8 1/3 innings for a 18.36 ERA: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center fielder Tony Gwynn went three for five, driving in a 
season-high-equaling four RBIs, as many as he had produced in his previous 32 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortstop Templeton obtained a season-high-equaling three hits, scoring 
three runs and driving in another, and was just a triple shy of hitting for the 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Second baseman Roberto Alomar went three for five with two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Pagliarulo went two for four with two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris James went two for four with a RBI 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bip Roberts went two for four with an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the box score, however, far more significant to the Padres' hopes of 
creeping back in the National League West race, is just how they are winning. 
</P>
<P>
There's a side to the Padres that's lurking beneath their success of late, 
resulting in 11 victories in their past 16 games, pushing them over the .500 
mark (58-57) for the first time since June 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't what you call it," pitcher Dennis Rasmussen said, "but it's there, 
it's there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Alomar: "I think people thought we were a good team before, but I don't 
think we intimidated anyone. I get a feeling we are now. We're still the same 
guys, but when we go between the white lines now, we act like we don't have 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care who's coming in, because now is when the bell rings." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' tear, not so coincidentally, began in Cincinnati. It was there that 
Reds pitcher Rick Mahler hit Padre catcher Benito Santiago with a pitch in the 
fourth inning. Rasmussen, who had a perfect game going, retaliated by throwing 
his first pitch of the inning at Mariano Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
There was no bench-clearing brawl. No one even emerged from the dugout. But the 
message was loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good sign, a real good sign," said Templeton, the Padre captain. 
"It tells the other team that we're not backing down from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres can hardly be considered arrogant, nor do they want to be perceived 
in the same way as the New York Mets, but they're sure letting the rest of the 
National League know that times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
And it's no secret that much of the transformation is directly attributed to 
the Eastern influx, James from Philadelphia and Pagliarulo from New York. 
</P>
<P>
You can ask Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey about James, who lowered his shoulder 
and bowled him over Sunday. Or ask Pirate catcher Junior Ortiz, who received a 
forearm shiver from James in their last visit to town. 
</P>
<P>
"His style of play has rubbed off," said Templeton, who was raised on this 
style of play since coming up in 1977. "Pags is the same way. We got two 
hard-nosed players right there." 
</P>
<P>
While James' style, not to mention his 14-game hitting streak (.412), is 
beginning to earn the adoration of Padre fans, Pagliarulo's aggression is 
legendary. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a couple of years ago when Pagliarulo was hit square in the bridge 
of his nose by a Curt Young pitch. It took almost 10 stitches to mend, and even 
then, his nose bled most of that Friday night and off and on Saturday during a 
Yankee day game. On Sunday, Pagliarulo was back in the lineup, hitting a home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've played a lot of baseball games with a broken nose," Pagliarulo 
said. "When I was a kid, the only way you'd get a field to play on was to fight 
for it. We scrapped for the fields, we scrapped for the equipment, and we 
scrapped in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear guys now say, 'Hey, let's go out and have run and relax.' For me, fun 
is knocking guys down, getting your uniform dirty, breaking up double plays. 
That's fun. That's how you're supposed to play, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, it sure is now, and the Padres have never had a better time. 
</P>
<P>
Winning three of four games in this series, and seven of their past nine 
series, the Padres now are within five games of the second-place Astros and 
eight games behind the first-place San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have to go like hell to catch the Giants," Padre Manager Jack 
McKeon said, "but I had a feeling they'd come together at the All-Star break, 
and I think they have. 
</P>
<P>
"I also think you're seeing a different team out there. 
</P>
<P>
"And I like what I'm seeing." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres drew 16,760 in an experimental 3:05 p.m. start, one home-plate 
umpire Bruce Froemming said he hopes never to see again. "The last three 
innings, you couldn't even see the ball," he said. "To play this time of day, 
you've got to be nuts." . . . The Astros, who were completing a 10-game trip, 
also were quite irritated. They didn't leave the stadium until 6:30 p.m. and 
weren't scheduled to arrive home until 1:30 a.m. "That's great," second baseman 
Billy Doran said, "but if you want to experiment, why don't you experiment with 
a team going up to Los Angeles." . . . Padre officials already are bracing 
themselves for The Who concert Aug. 22 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
They've informed the players that they still can leave their cars at the 
stadium during the trip that begins Aug. 14 but advised against it. . . . Doran 
on his slump, in which he's hitting .131 since June 25: "I've given the word 
'slump' a whole new meaning. Instead of saying, 'I'm in a slump,' people are 
going to say, 'I'm in a Billy Doran.' " . . . The Astros, who were vying for 
the division lead for the first time since June 12 when they began their 
three-city trip, instead went 3-7 and were outscored, 59-32, including 54-12 in 
their seven defeats.

WATSON ONE BACK AFTER 67; PALMER, NICKLAUS SHOOT 68S

<P>
Tom Watson pulled the verbal trigger on the wildly improbable first round of 
the 71st PGA Thursday at steamy Kemper Lakes Golf Club when he shot a 
five-under-par 67 and described it as his "second coming." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a blast from the past. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, who has won every major championship except the PGA, played perfectly 
princely golf in a round that included six birdies, numerous wizardly par saves 
and only one bogey. 
</P>
<P>
But the second coming belonged to the man the other players simply call "the 
King." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer shot a 68 that would have been a 66 if he had not bogeyed the 
last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
"This," howled one member of his legendary army near the 13th green, "is a 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer was actually tied for first briefly at six under par with early leader 
Mike Reid after draining an eight-foot birdie putt on the par-five 15th. It 
marked the first time since 1981 in the British Open that he had led at any 
point in any major tournament in the '80s. And it set off a roar that could be 
heard all the way back to the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Palmer won a regular PGA Tour event was 16 years ago in the Bob 
Hope Desert Classic. Two weeks ago in the British Open, he shot 82-82 and 
missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way to predict any of this. And there is no way of knowing what 
will follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to tomorrow," Palmer said afterward. "I'm as 
curious as you are." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer will be 60 in a month. After he birdied the fourth, fifth, sixth, 
seventh and eighth holes with putts of 20, four, eight, 15 and 25 feet, 
respectively, he said he felt 29, two less than the number of strokes he needed 
on the front side. 
</P>
<P>
Like Watson, Palmer has never won a PGA. He finished second in 1964, '68 and 
'70. Watson's best PGA was at Oakmont in 1978, when he led after three rounds 
before losing to John Mahaffey in a playoff that included Jerry Pate. 
</P>
<P>
Like Watson, Palmer believes he can still win this one and join Gene Sarazen, 
Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus as the only players to win the four 
so-called major championships. 
</P>
<P>
"If I play and feel like I did today?" Palmer said. "Yes, I can." 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Reid shares the lead in this thing with Leonard Thompson, a North 
Carolinian who eagled the seventh hole but went home wondering why nobody 
wanted to hear about it. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, nicknamed "Radar," is a frighteningly straight driver who missed one 
green and one fairway, made no bogeys and never even took his lavender knit 
sweater off. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, who is 10 years younger than Palmer and 10 years older than Watson, 
shot a 68 because, in his words, "I made almost every putt I looked at, which 
was kind of fun. How many? I can't count that low." 
</P>
<P>
Texans Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw shot a 67 and a 68, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Watson and Kite at 67 was Chris Perry, who is more famous for being the 
nephew of a guy named Gaylord who used to apply foreign substances to major 
league baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Palmer, Nicklaus and Crenshaw were Phil Blackmar, who is 6-feet-7; Ian 
Woosnam, who is 5-4; Mark O'Meara, who made a hole-in-one with a 7-iron on the 
173-yard third hole, and Dave Rummells. 
</P>
<P>
David Edwards made eight birdies and five bogeys to head a group at 69 that 
included five other players. Pre-tournament favorites Greg Norman and Paul 
Azinger each shot a 74 and are probably wondering what foreign substance they 
forgot to apply to their golf balls. U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange was two 
under par. Sevie Ballesteros was even par. Former PGA champion Lee Trevino was 
two over par. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for all the low scores were a lack of wind, and fairways still 
softened from the nine inches of rain that has fallen here since July 18. 
Seventeen players shot 70s. Twelve finished with 71s. 
</P>
<P>
"The course is playing about as easy as it's going to play," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely flabbergasted at the scores," Nicklaus added. 
</P>
<P>
And as surprised as everybody else at Palmer. Playing the 12th hole together, 
Kite and Nicklaus glanced toward Palmer and his huge gallery several fairways 
ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
"He's leading this golf tournament," Kite said to Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
"He sure is," Nicklaus replied, "That's something else, isn't it." 
</P>
<P>
It's more than that. As late as last week Palmer was talking about cutting back 
his schedule on the Seniors tour because of the precipitous dropoff in the 
quality of his play. 
</P>
<P>
He even considered withdrawing here to give a younger player his place in the 
field. But three days ago the cold that had settled in his back at the British 
Open began to feel better. And his practice sessions started getting better. So 
he put those thoughts aside. 
</P>
<P>
"I prepare," he said, "with the idea that a day like this will come along." 
</P>
<P>
But the wait was sooooooooo long. The last time he shot this low in the first 
round of the PGA was 24 years ago. The last time he shot a 68 in the U.S. Open 
was 1973. The last time he shot a 68 at the Masters was 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be something," Palmer said, "if Nicklaus, Watson and myself were all on 
the leader board together Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
All three will have to drive better. And we're not talking courtesy cars here. 
Palmer found three bunkers off the tee in the last five holes and almost drove 
in the water on 18. Nicklaus began hooking his driver early on and switched to 
a three-wood in mid-round. Watson hit only seven of 14 fairways. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Kemper Lakes is relatively long at 7,197 yards, "this golf course 
favors anybody who hits the ball straight," Watson said. "So how do you explain 
my score?" 
</P>
<P>
You don't. Not any more than you explain Palmer's revival or the sudden magic 
in Nicklaus' putter. 
</P>
<P>
Or Reid, who ranks second-to-last in tour driving distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack climbed up the beanstalk and knocked the giant down in the nursery 
rhyme," he said. 
</P>
<P>
PGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Co-leader Mike Reid refuses to use a metal wood because he doesn't like the way 
they sound. "In my mind's eye I can see dogs hearing that noise and taking off 
in the other direction." . . . First prize in this tournament is $200,000 which 
means if Tom Kite wins, he could pass Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus and move 
into first place on the PGA career money list. Watson currently leads that 
category with $5,112,182. Nicklaus is second at $5,065,884. Kite has 
$4,926,277. . . . Talk about a one tournament year: San Diego's Greg Twiggs, 
who earned $126,000 for winning the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open in February, 
has won less than $16,000 in 16 events since then. Worse, he has missed the cut 
in seven of the last eight tournaments he has entered. During that span his 
best finish was 81st at the Western Open. Twiggs shot one under par 71 
Thursday. . . . Writer's block? David Ogrin, a native of nearby Waukegan, is 
writing a daily column for the Chicago Sun-Times during the tournament. Will 
words be able to describe the quadruple bogey he made on the 11th when he 
pumped two balls in the water? "I didn't want to talk to nobody or no thing," 
Ogrin said. "It ruined my day and maybe my tournament." Ogrin's score: 77.

VLASIC WONDERING IF HE CAN GET BACK TO WHERE HE WAS

<P>
Mark Vlasic was little more than halfway through his second start as the 
Charger quarterback last November when his season abruptly ended. 
</P>
<P>
His left knee buckled under the weight of Ram defensive lineman Shawn Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The seriousness was so clear that the diagnosis and prognosis were done on the 
field. X-rays merely confirmed what Vlasic already had been told. 
</P>
<P>
An operation would be needed to repair torn knee ligaments and cartilage 
damage, with about six months of rehabilitation to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly nine months after that Nov. 20 game, Vlasic still is waiting to regain 
his place on the football field. He took another small step this week, donning 
pads for the first time since the operation. But how much longer it will be 
before Vlasic is back competing for the starting job he held so briefly, yet 
productively, he is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day it gets a little stronger," Vlasic said. "I don't think it will be 
too much longer before I am out there. I hope to be out there competing by the 
last two exhibition games." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are questions. Trying to come back on a rebuilt knee has moments 
of doubt, especially on those days when the tightness and soreness grow worse. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like it gets a little stronger every day," Vlasic said. "Then, 
sometimes, I come back the next day to practice, and it doesn't feel as good as 
the other day. That makes me think maybe it's going to take a little longer 
than I think." 
</P>
<P>
The danger is that Vlasic will rush his recovery and do himself more damage in 
the end. That is what he fears he did by attempting too much in the team's 
mini-camp in May. Vlasic said he made a mistake by throwing then. 
</P>
<P>
"I should not have been out there," Vlasic said. "But being competitive, you 
don't want to stand around; you want to be out there doing it. That was what I 
was trying to do. That wasn't someone else saying go out and throw, that was 
me. But I don't want to get caught up in that same situation now." 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy for that to happen all over. With a new coaching staff led by 
Dan Henning, Vlasic feels a little extra pressure to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know me, and I don't know them," Vlasic said. "We're in a situation 
where everyone is getting accustomed to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until late in the season that I was used last year. From the 
outside, maybe it looks like they didn't have anything to lose, so they threw 
me in there. I don't know if they look at that way or not. But I felt I was 
ready, and when I got the chance, I made the best of it. Now it is just a 
matter of going out and proving it again." 
</P>
<P>
But making matters more difficult, Vlasic has had to sit and watch two new arms 
come into camp -- those of David Archer and Billy Joe Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
Archer is a favorite of Henning's, having started 22 games for him in 1985-86 
when Henning was the coach in Atlanta. And Tolliver is the latest candidate for 
quarterback of the future, the Chargers having traded up to take him in the 
second round of the 1989 draft. 
</P>
<P>
Those two join Mark Malone, who started the final four games after Vlasic's 
injury, winning two, as Vlasic's competition. Vlasic only wishes he knew when 
the competition could begin. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the toughest thing," Vlasic said. "You are out watching, but you want 
to get out and be competing. Yet, you don't want to put yourself at a 
disadvantage because you are not at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, it comes to the point where you have waited long enough; you have to 
get in there. You have got to go in and show somebody you can do the job. It is 
just frustrating now not being able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The injury is a frustrating setback to a career that was just beginning to 
deliver on some of its promise. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers drafted Vlasic, 6-feet-3, 203 pounds, out of Iowa in the 
fourth round in 1987, he was billed as a likely successor to Dan Fouts. He 
spent all but the final quarter of Fouts' farewell season on the bench. His 
lone appearance came in a game played in a blizzard in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Vlasic started 1988 as a backup to off-season acquisitions Babe Laufenberg and 
Malone. Not until after the Chargers opened the season by losing eight of their 
first 10 games did Vlasic get his chance. He responded by completing 16 of 32 
passes for 190 yards in leading the Chargers to a 10-7 victory in Atlanta. The 
next week in Anaheim Stadium, the Chargers were leading, 24-14, late in the 
third quarter on their way to a 38-24 victory when Vlasic went down. 
</P>
<P>
Before the injury, he had completed nine of 20 passes for 80 yards and his 
first National Football League touchdown pass -- a four-yarder to wide receiver 
Quinn Early, a former teammate at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"To have the opening and then to lose it after (the injury), that is 
frustrating," Vlasic. "I missed out on four games. I could have that much more 
experience under my belt, then it might have been a different situation coming 
into training camp than it is." 
</P>
<P>
The injury did more than affect Vlasic's knee, it adversely affected his 
throwing motion. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest thing was stepping from the plant foot over to the left foot and 
not being able to follow through," Vlasic said. "That was my biggest problem. I 
developed some bad habits when I wasn't able to come straight over. I spent the 
whole time at mini-camp altering what I altered to get back throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talks about having a good arm, but if you use all arm, that sucker 
isn't going to last but a quarter or so. You feel like when you are out there, 
you are doing fine. You can't figure why the arm is so sore. Why you can't get 
the zip on the ball two days in a row. You go back to watch it on the film, and 
you realize the mechanics aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
Vlasic has been injured before -- a separated shoulder forced him to miss three 
games in his senior year at Iowa -- but nothing like this. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect to get out of the hospital and be able to go out and do what you 
were before and do it do the same level," Vlasic said. "But here it is eight 
months later, and I'm still working on some mechanics. It is not what it used 
to be, and it might never be the same." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said that he would today announce his starting quarterback 
for Sunday's noon exhibition game against Dallas at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. . . . Add Dennis McKnight to the list of injured Charger centers. 
McKnight, an eight-year pro who has been switched to center after starting at 
right guard last season, said he had his right knee drained by Dr. Gary Losse 
Wednesday night after it swelled up following the afternoon practice. McKnight 
said Losse removed blood from the knee but said there did not appear to be any 
ligament or cartilage damage. He said Loose told him he might have 
hyperextended it.

U.S. SOCCER TEAM SIMPLY OUTMANNED, 2-0; 
</P>
<P>
ITALY'S JUVENTUS STAYS UNDER WRAPS, WILL PLAY MEXICO IN TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The best thing that can be said for the U.S. national soccer team Thursday 
night at the Coliseum is that it gave Juventus of Turin, Italy, one of the 
world's most successful teams, a workout, which is more than the Americans 
could have done in years past. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean the United States challenged La Juve, 22-time champion of 
the powerful Italian League and the only team to win all three major European 
cups (Champions, Cup Winner's Cup and UEFA). Juventus won, 2-0, and could have 
scored two or three times as many goals. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Juventus was saving its direct hits for the Marlboro Cup championship 
game, which it will play at 6 p.m. Sunday in the Coliseum against Mexico, a 4-2 
winner over South Korea in Thursday night's second game. The United States and 
South Korea will meet at 4 p.m. Sunday for third place. 
</P>
<P>
Disqualified from the 1990 World Cup in Italy because it used over-age players 
in a youth tournament, Mexico is developing a team for the future. It appears 
to have found a good place to start in forward Ricardo Pelaez, who scored all 
four goals -- a Mexican hat trick plus one -- against the Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
In a vastly more entertaining game than the first one, there were four goals 
scored within the first seven minutes of the second half. South Korea scored 
the two in the middle, cutting Mexico's lead to 3-2. But then Paleaz added his 
fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the U.S. defense was responsible for Juventus' difficulties in 
finishing its numerous scoring opportunities -- the official statisticians 
counted 17 shots on goal for the Italians to only seven for the Americans -- no 
doubt will be debated today in Turin, where European football is no more 
important than American football in, say, Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But for the sake of argument, it appeared as if the United States frustrated 
Juventus for a time by crowding eight or nine men in the penalty box. It did 
not make for elegant soccer, this dime defense by the Americans, but it was 
effective for almost a half. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it provided time for goalkeeper Tony Meola to settle his nerves. 
A third baseman from the University of Virginia who decided to devote his 
summer to soccer, he was supposed to make his debut against an Italian first 
division team in a tournament at Saint Vincent, Italy last Saturday, when the 
U.S. played AS Roma. 
</P>
<P>
But Meola was hit in the head by a teammate's shot during the warmup and was 
unable to play because of dizziness. So he had his initiation under fire 
Thursday night against the team in the black and white vertical stripes, which 
are as famous worldwide as the Yankee pinstripes are in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the spectators, 21,307 of them, were quiet for most of the first game, 
saving their voices for the Mexicans and Koreans as it became apparent later, 
Meola did earn the applause of Juventus midfielder Rui Barros after making a 
save on a header by Roberto Tricella near the end of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But Barros was not as kind with his feet as he was with his hands. With two 
minutes remaining in the first half, Meola made one of his best saves of the 
night on a shot by Giancarlo Marocchi, only to lose his balance. He watched 
helplessly as the rebound was converted into the game's first goal by Barros. 
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes into the second half, Juventus scored an insurance goal that it 
did not really need against the punchless Americans on a play that could not 
have been drawn better. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Allesio set up the goal with a run down the right sideline, followed by 
a pass toward the center of the field that appeared headed for a teammate 
positioned directly in front of Meola. But with Meola concentrating on him, the 
ball sailed overhead to Salvatore Schillachi on the left flank. His goal was 
virtually uncontested. 
</P>
<P>
Juventus missed other opportunities to score by only the width of the posts, 
but that is what training camp is all about. After a disappointing fourth-place 
finish last year in the Italian League, La Juve is fine-tuning in preparation 
for its comeback. The regular season begins in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S. attack, it did not appear to be that of a team that is in the 
middle of its World Cup qualifications. Some of that no doubt was due to the 
absence of midfielder Tab Ramos, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last 
week and may return in time for the Sept. 17 game against El Salvador, and Hugo 
Perez, who has signed with a second division team in France but will be 
available for qualification games. 
</P>
<P>
The United States' best chance to score came in the first half when forward 
Bruce Murray's header hit the crossbar. Murray left the game with an injury in 
the second half, although it did not appear serious. 
</P>
<P>
So the Americans are not ready to play in the Italian first division, at least 
not against Juventus. But they knew that before Thursday night.

ANGELS LOSE IN 10TH INNING; INJURY WILL SIDELINE SCHOFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Oakland Athletics are here, braced for 1989's final regular-season meeting 
between the leaders in the American League West, but where are the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Lance Parrish is out with aching ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Designated Brian Downing is out with the latest flare-up of his rib cage 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
And now shortstop Dick Schofield is out, for an anticipated two to three weeks, 
after breaking his left hand in the third inning of the Angels' 3-2, 10-inning 
loss to the Seattle Mariners Thursday night before 26,924 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Angel timing, cursed for 29 straight summers, strikes again. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of their most important series of the season, after spending four 
months fending off the injury-ravaged A's, the Angels found themselves suddenly 
in worse condition than the Bashed Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
And the night began so promisingly for the Angels. Claudell Washington, missing 
since the weekend because of a bruised shoulder, returned to the starting 
lineup and singled home a run. Chuck Finley, bidding for his 14th victory, had 
nine strikeouts after five innings, on his way to 12 over nine-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
But in the bottom of third, Seattle starter Scott Bankhead hit Schofield in the 
hand with an errant fastball, resulting in a fracture of the fifth metacarpal 
bone. Once X-rays determined the break, Schofield had the hand placed in a 
splint, facing a stint on the disabled list that could extend until September. 
</P>
<P>
Seven innings later, with the score tied, at 2-2, Mariner third baseman Jim 
Presley opened the 10th inning with a home run to center field, sending Finley 
to his eighth defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Through nine innings, Finley had allowed only three hits -- and only one 
scratch single by Alvin Davis after the second. In one stretch, Finley retired 
20 of 23 batters, yielding just a trio of walks. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader tried to milk one more inning out of him, but the 10th 
proved to be more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately following Presley's home run, Finley walked Dave Valle and was 
through for the night. Relievers Willie Fraser and Bob McClure then came on to 
close out the inning. 
</P>
<P>
That meant the Angels would have to face Seattle's ace reliever, Mike Schooler, 
in the bottom of the 10th -- and that, not surprisingly, resulted in 
frustration. Three Angels up, three Angels down -- and Schooler had his 23rd 
save. 
</P>
<P>
The victory went to Mike Jackson (4-5), who recorded the final two outs of the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Finley fell behind quickly, yielding a two-run home run in the second inning on 
the first pitch he threw to Henry Cotto, thus continuing one of the quirkier 
streaks to crop up this season. For Cotto, the hit was his third home run in as 
many at-bats -- each of them coming on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Three pitches, three homers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Cotto hadn't appeared in a game since Aug. 1, so he had some time to 
prepare between pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels tied the score, 2-2, in the third. Jack Howell led off with a walk 
before Schofield was hit with the pitch that figures to sideline him through 
August. Schofield left the game immediately, giving way to pinch-runner Kent 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Howell scored on a single to right by Washington. Anderson took third on the 
hit and came home on another single by Johnny Ray. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had opportunities to break the tie in the sixth and seventh innings, 
only to leave a runner stranded at third both times. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Ray singled and advanced to third on a one-out single by Wally 
Joyner -- but was left there as Tony Armas flied to right and Chili Davis 
struck out. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, the Angels loaded the bases via walks to Howell and Ray and an 
infield single by Washington. But with two out, White snuffed the threat by 
flying out to center field. 
</P>
<P>
That out proved to be the last pitch of the evening for Seattle starter Scott 
Bankhead. To open the eighth, Mariner Manager Jim Lefebvre brought on Keith 
Comstock, who retired the side in order and struck out Bill Schroeder in the 
ninth before surrendering a single to Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson then replaced Comstock and promptly walked Anderson. But again, Howell 
remained stranded in scoring position as Comstock got Washington and Ray both 
to fly out. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, Schooler faced the Angels' No. 3-4-5 hitters and retired them in 
order -- Devon White on a fly to right, Joyner on a pop to shortstop and Armas 
on a grounder to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
You can tell the Athletics are coming to town by the way the wounded Angels are 
lining up to take batting practice. Thursday, catcher Lance Parrish tested his 
sore ribs in the cage and tonight, Brian Downing is planning to do the same. 
Parrish, in fact, was lobbying to play Thursday, telling reporters, "I feel 
like I'm ready to play, but I'm having trouble convincing everyone else. They 
don't want to rush anything." The prognosis was for Parrish to miss seven to 10 
games, but Parrish said, "I'm trying to speed it up. I'm used to playing with 
injuries. If need be, I could play (tonight). The big problem is, everyone 
feels I might set myself back. Personally, I don't feel I could do that, unless 
I get hit at the plate or something like that." If Parrish does play, it will 
probably be as a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels-A's series, billed as the playoff before the playoffs, is receiving 
the proper treatment. Media interest in the three games has prompted the Angels 
to install an extra row of temporary seats for the press, and advance ticket 
sales have broken Angel club records. The Angels announced the following 
pregame sale totals for the series: tonight -- 53,000; Saturday -- 48,000; 
Sunday -- 51,000. That's a three-game total of 152,000, eclipsing the Angels' 
previous record for a three-game series at Anaheim Stadium -- 146,010, set in 
1982 against Kansas City.

<P>
Rather than get caught looking ahead, Tony La Russa took care of the matter at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa brought in Dennis Eckersley to nail down the Oakland Athletics' 4-1 
victory over the Chicago White Sox Thursday knowing it means he probably won't 
be able to call on his relief ace tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The A's open a three-game series against the Angels tonight in Anaheim with the 
American League West lead on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pitched him twice in less than 24 hours and he was not as sharp as I 
would have liked," La Russa said. "His stats speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a good job today without good stuff. He is the best in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley allowed no runs and two hits in 1 2/3 innings, reducing his 
earned-run average to 1.07 while picking up his 23rd save in 25 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
In 33 2/3 innings this season, Eckersley has allowed only four runs -- three on 
home runs -- and 18 hits, walked two and struck out 38. 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing about Tony is that he uses me perfectly," Eckersley said. "He 
always knows when to bring me into a game. It's not his intention to burn me 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"If Tony brings me in every day, I'm not going to be able to handle it. I don't 
have that kind of arm, but every other day is perfect for me." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley got his ninth save in 10 chances after Storm Davis (12-5) pitched six 
shutout innings, allowing six hits, walking two and striking out one to win for 
the ninth time in his last 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Nelson pitched 1 1/3 innings before La Russa went to Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
"Storm has done a great job and it was not a case of him getting tired," 
LaRussa said. "With my bullpen so deep, I'm not afraid to rest my starters." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was lifted after allowing a one-out double to Carlton Fisk in the 
eighth. Steve Lyons singled off Eckersley, sending Fisk to third, and Carlos 
Martinez's fielder's choice grounder scored Fisk to make it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Darryl Boston also singled before Eckersley struck out Ron 
Karkovice to end the inning and retired the side in order in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson gave the Athletics two more runs with a single in the ninth 
off Donn Pall after a two-out walk to Felix Jose and a double by Mike Gallego. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rosenberg (3-8) allowed only two hits in seven innings, but both came in 
the fourth, when the Athletics scored their first two runs on Tony Phillips' 
sacrifice fly and a run-scoring single by Gallego. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg was upset with himself for walking Mark McGwire to start the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It led to the two runs," he said of the four-pitch walk, "and while I gave up 
only two hits, you can't throw four straight wide ones like I did to start an 
inning." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg walked five and struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago had 10 hits to five for the Athletics, but White Sox Manager Jeff 
Torborg was upset at his team's failure to convert its opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We just screwed up and it cost us," Torborg said. "But our starting pitching 
has been great the last month and Rosenberg gave us seven quality innings." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 10, Cleveland 3 -- Joey Meyer drove in five runs and Robin Yount had 
four hits as the Brewers trounced the Indians at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat prevented the Indians from moving to the .500 mark and closing to 
within two games of Baltimore in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Higuera (8-4) won his fifth straight start, giving up two runs on 10 hits 
in 5 2/3 innings before leaving because of a sore left ankle.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
DOWN 10-3, PHILLIES TOP CUBS, 16-13

<P>
There was thunder and lightning again at Chicago, and that was before the storm 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
It simply meant that the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies were 
involved in one of their familiar pitching duels at Wrigley Field, seeing who 
could do the most damage to the other team's pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
After 29 runs, 35 hits and 11 pitchers, the Phillies escaped with a 16-13 
victory shortly before a storm hit the north side of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
For all the excitement, it wasn't even close to a couple of past Cub-Phillie 
slugfests -- Chicago's 26-23 victory in 1922 and Philadelphia's 23-22 win in 
1979. They are the two highest-scoring games in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
"Frightening afternoon," Phillie Manager Nick Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat ended the Cubs' three-game winning streak and cut their National 
League East lead to 2 1/2 games over idle Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Parrett (9-4) held the Cubs hitless over the last three innings. 
</P>
<P>
After six homers, including two by the Cubs' Ryne Sandberg that gave him five 
in four games, the game was decided by a roller up the middle by Ricky Jordan 
that scored the tying and go-ahead runs in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's single gave him three hits and four runs batted in for the Phillies, 
who trailed, 10-3, before rallying to take a 12-10 lead in the sixth. The Cubs 
came back in the bottom of the sixth to regain the lead, 13-12, before the 
Phillies rallied again. 
</P>
<P>
Cub rookie Jerome Walton ran his hitting streak to 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg opened the Cubs scoring with a homer in the first and capped an 
eight-run outburst in the third with a two-run homer. He also made the score 
12-12 with an RBI double in the sixth. Smith followed with a single up the 
middle to put the Cubs ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Phillies got seven runs in the fifth, including Daulton's three-run 
homer and a two-run, pinch-hit homer by Randy Ready. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5-6, St. Louis 1-4 -- Kevin McReynolds hit a game-tying three-run 
homer in a six-run sixth inning as the Mets rallied in the second game to sweep 
the Cardinals at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets stretched their winning streak to five games and moved to within 3 1/2 
games of the Cubs in the East, while the Cardinals fell 5 1/2 back. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero's two-run homer in the fourth inning to give the Cardinals a 3-0 
lead in the nightcap before the Mets erupted against Ricky Horton and John 
Costello. After McReynolds' homer, Barry Lyons and Darryl Strawberry hit 
run-scoring doubles and Gary Carter had a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Darling (10-9) pitched a seven-hitter and McReynolds hit a solo homer in 
the opener as the Mets beat Jose DeLeon (11-11) for the first time in four 
decisions this season. 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds has 14 RBIs in his last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 13, Houston 3 -- Tony Gwynn drove in four runs with three hits as the 
Padres routed replacement starter Bob Forsch and the Astros at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Houston three games behind San Francisco in the NL West. The 
Padres improved to 58-57, the first time they've been over .500 since June 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored four runs in the first inning and three more in the second 
against Forsch, who gave up 10 runs on 18 hits in his last appearance, an 18-2 
loss to Cincinnati on Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Forsch (3-4) replaced Mike Scott, who leads the majors with 17 victories, but 
couldn't pitch because of a pulled hamstring muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris (5-6) gave up six hits in eight innings, striking out six and 
improving to 4-0 against Houston in his career.

SEAL BEACH WILL HOST TOP PROS FOR $100,000 OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top professional beach volleyball players will be at Seal Beach pier this 
weekend for the $100,000 Seal Beach Open, one of the richest events on this 
year's tour. 
</P>
<P>
The winningest team on this year's tour, Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos, and 
the team that has earned the most prize money, Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland, will 
lead the pack as the two-day tournament begins at 9 a.m. Saturday, with the 
final rounds beginning at 8 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who agree with volleyball promoter Craig Elledge, who maintains 
that the two-man game can get a little tedious, there is another option 
available Saturday. There will be an exhibition of Elledge's new American Beach 
Volleyball League, which uses a four-man format. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will run simultaneously with the Legends tournament at the 
Hermosa Beach pier. There will be $12,500 in prize money divided among the four 
teams that will participate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to show that four people on the beach are better than two," said 
Elledge, who promotes several events for the women's pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
The four-man format -- a compromise between the traditional two-man beach game 
and the six-man indoor game -- is not new. But Elledge says this is the first 
attempt to determine whether it can succeed as a pro sport. 
</P>
<P>
"This game really moves," Elledge said. "There are more rallies. There's more 
strategy involved. It sounds like a great theory, so now we want to see if it 
will work." 
</P>
<P>
Elledge said he selected four prominent players as team captains for the 
exhibition and allowed them to fill out their teams. The captains are Craig 
Buck, a two-time Olympic gold medalist; Andy Fishburn, who twice won the World 
Championship of beach volleyball; David Rottman, a member of the U.S. national 
team, and Bill Stetson, who set for a national championship team at USC.

BEACH TOURNEY WILL SALUTE THE LEGENDARY STARS OF VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the average sports fan, it's not exactly Koufax and Drysdale returning to 
Chavez Ravine. But on the beach, the names Selznick and Vogelsang and Von Hagen 
and Menges also conjure visions of heroic summers long ago. 
</P>
<P>
They played volleyball. They were kings of the beach before the tour went pro 
and the "beach" was extended to Phoenix and Milwaukee and Boulder, Colo. Before 
light beer and cable television. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's Legends tournament at the Hermosa Beach pier was designed for 
the people who remember when success in beach volleyball was measured in 
adoration and not in six-figure incomes, says event founder Chris Marlowe. 
</P>
<P>
And, he adds, it's for the stars of volleyball past. "The tournament is more or 
less an honor for the players who built the game," Marlowe said. "They made no 
money and played in a lot less tournaments, so they never got the recognition 
of the players today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to watch the players you've heard about but have never seen." 
</P>
<P>
The idea was born about three years ago, says Marlowe, a former beach star who 
captained the 1984 Olympic volleyball team to a gold medal and now announces 
cable broadcasts of professional beach volleyball events. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us were sitting around talking about the old days, comparing those 
players to the young guys," he said. "I think it was when Sinjin Smith passed 
(Ron) Von Hagen (for the all-time lead in tournament victories). There was a 
lot of talk like that back then." 
</P>
<P>
The Legends idea also sounded good to Dave Heiser, a retired schoolteacher and 
volleyball enthusiast who organized tournaments in the Santa Monica area during 
the 1950s and '60s. Fittingly, Heiser puts on the Legends tournaments -- this 
will be the third annual event -- just as he did back when the players were in 
their prime. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the philosophy of the Legends tournament is to see how people hold 
together as the years go by," said Heiser, 65, whose Santa Monica apartment 
resembles a beach museum. Its walls are lined with yellowing photographs of 
tanned young men playing volleyball and surfing -- the crew cuts of the 1950s 
in one shot, flying long hair from the '60s in the next. 
</P>
<P>
"It's phenomenal that the players are still so agile and play so great," Heiser 
said. "Also, I don't think the players' approach to the game -- their shots, 
their moves -- changes that much. They know all the tricks." 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which will begin round-robin play Saturday morning leading up 
to the final rounds Sunday, is not your typical old-timers game, Heiser and 
Marlowe agree. 
</P>
<P>
These players don't go half-speed -- with perhaps one exception. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Bob (Vogey) Vogelsang, a star of the 1950s and '60s who is 
known as the father of the jump-serve, a technique now commonly used on both 
the men's and women's pro tours. Always one of the characters of the circuit, 
things haven't changed much as he pushes 50. 
</P>
<P>
"Vogelsang would lose a tournament to get a laugh," Heiser said. "Life's just a 
ball to him." 
</P>
<P>
That's entertainment. A perfect player for an old-timer's game. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 32 Legends and 31 wouldn't play with Vogey," Marlowe said, laughing. 
"We had to put together a search committee." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they persuaded Bill Imwalle to play straight man to the clown 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
The players don't take the event lightly. According to Marlowe, one player 
canceled because, despite his training, he was not playing at a level he would 
display publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The opposite is true of Ron Lang, Heiser said. Word is that Lang -- one of the 
game's most talented players -- was unhappy after lugging around his added 
weight at last year's Legends event. So he went into training. Heiser suspects 
a new, trimmer Lang will come down from the Lake Tahoe area for this year's 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably one of the smartest players around," Heiser said. "He was a 
complete player -- he could pass, set, make shots. He was not a power hitter, 
but he had such great wrist action that he could still snap the ball down. 
</P>
<P>
"And he had hands of gold. Just unbelievable hands." 
</P>
<P>
Lang's partners from two different eras will also be there. Gene Selznick is a 
volleyball pioneer who played with Lang at the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
And Von Hagen, 50, perhaps the most dominant player in the history of the game, 
got his start with Lang. He eventually amassed a record 62 tournament victories 
during a career when he rarely played more than 10 tournaments each season. Von 
Hagen has since been passed by both Smith and his partner, Randy Stoklos, on 
the all-time list, but the younger players have competed in more than 20 events 
each season. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled to play in the tournament are Mike O'Hara, Selznick's archenemy 
from the '50s and '60s who won the first five Manhattan Beach opens (1960-64); 
Jim Menges, the sport's top player during the 1970s, and Marlowe. 
</P>
<P>
And Greg Lee and Tom Chamales and Bob Clem and Fred Zuelich and Larry Rundle 
and Buzz Swartz and Rick Shaw and Gary Hooper. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just about everyone," Marlowe said. "Of course, there are a couple of 
players who have slipped through the cracks, but the response to this has been 
excellent." 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe hopes to eventually expand the Legends format to a four- or five-event 
tour. But, he says, that would require more money than the $600 each player is 
getting to participate (plus another $150 apiece to the winning team, $100 
apiece to the second-place team and the winners of the consolation bracket, and 
$50 apiece to the consolation runners-up). 
</P>
<P>
There will be a Legends banquet Sunday to honor five players who, because of 
age or injury, cannot play in the tournament: Manny Saenz, Bernie Holtzman, 
Mike Bright, Kirk Kilgour and Keith Erikson.

STONEY POINT IN CHATSWORTH PROVIDES CLIMBERS WHO WANT A PIECE OF THE ROCK WITH 
AN ACCESSIBLE DAYTIME TRAINING GROUND FOR ADVANCED MANEUVERS AND ARTISTIC 
EXPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's nearly sunset at Stoney Point, a boulder-strewA. city park in northern 
Chatsworth that's popular with rock climbers and rock heads. In the last few 
minutes of daylight, before the rock heads slink in and begin another evening 
of hard drinking and environmental destruction, a handful of rock climbers get 
in a few more ascents on a massive sandstone boulder named Turlock. 
</P>
<P>
One of the climbers is Mike Rubin, a Tarzana chiropractor who calls himself 
"the Rock Doc." Rubin is attempting a tricky maneuver on what's known as the 
"flake," a wide lip about halfway up the rock. As he edges his Boreal Fire 
sneakers onto a thin shelf, he loses his grip and utters the dreaded O word: 
</P>
<P>
"Oooooops," he says as he begins to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Rock Doc has three things going for him: 1) he's insured; 2) 
Rachel Weil is holding the other end of the rope he's attached to, and 3) he's 
only five feet off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin is just discovering rock climbing, a sport that takes itself seriously as 
an art. A rock climber will tell you that most other forms of climbing are to 
rock climbing what street fighting is to tai chi. Rock climbers talk of 
"solving problems" and "elegant solutions" and making the climb look 
effortless, as though they were walking on level ground instead of defying 
gravity on a vertical wall. 
</P>
<P>
Rock climbers go off on the weekends to idyllic climbing sites in the Sierra, 
far away from city life. But during the week they come to Chatsworth to 
practice at the Eton of rock climbing. Stoney Point is considered one of the 
world's best places to work out, a gym for climbers, because it offers a 
variety of challenges, most only a few feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
But even its otherworldly appearance -- boulders piled on top of boulders -- 
isn't enough to make climbers forget they're in the city. Aside from heavy 
traffic on Topanga Canyon Boulevard and trails littered with wine cooler 
bottles, there is graffiti on even the most inaccessible rocks, which raises 
the question: Do they teach climbing at graffiti school? 
</P>
<P>
"This is not what rock climbing is all about," says Weil, a climbing instructor 
who lives in Northridge, as she gazes at the splattered rock walls that look 
like freeway underpasses. "But this is where we go to meet friends and train 
and get a pump." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin is pretty pumped up after being lowered to earth by Weil. He gets right 
back on Turlock and starts toward the top, which is about 15 feet above him. 
"If you get stuck and want advice, let me know," Weil tells him. "If not, 
you're on your own." Rubin tiptoes unsteadily. "Try not to get your legs spread 
out," she says. "Trust your right foot." 
</P>
<P>
Straining and looking a little ungainly, Rubin manages to pull himself up on 
the flake and then scrambles triumphantly to the top. "Air's a little thin up 
here," he says with a smile. Weil then retraces his route, without the aid of a 
rope, and walks up easily, her form perfect. "She's ballet on the rock," says 
Rubin, who is trading out chiropractic adjustments for climbing lessons. 
</P>
<P>
While Weil works with Rubin, a couple of experienced climbers are not only 
walking up Turlock but also around it. Jan McCollum, Weil's boyfriend, is 
practicing his traversing technique. A climber for 16 years, McCollum has done 
a lot of big climbs in the Sierra, something he was able to do only because he 
learned all the right moves on Turlock. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on this rock thousands of times," says McCollum, who wears blue 
slipper-like climbing shoes. "But the only way you can boulder the same place 
all the time is to make a game out of it. If everyone else goes left to right, 
you go right to left. Or you make a route harder by taking a hold off of it." 
</P>
<P>
The other veteran on Turlock, Steve Root, is a Kentuckian who moved to 
Chatsworth last year to be near Stoney Point. "I love this place," says Root, 
who wants to be a climbing guide. "It's tremendous to train here because you 
can train year-round. The locals kind of put it down -- sandstone is not the 
best rock -- but everyone is glad it's here." 
</P>
<P>
A soft twilight descends on Stoney Point. A couple of young women come down a 
trail from the upper reaches of the park and decide to finish their day on 
Turlock. Pascale Dubois and Kiki Delmas are Frenchwomen living in Pasadena. 
Neither climbed until they moved to this country last September. 
</P>
<P>
Delmas, a free-lance photographer, takes an easy route up Turlock and attaches 
a carabineer to a bolt anchored on top. Then she lowers a rope to Dubois, who 
ties a follow-through figure-eight and straps herself into a waist harness. 
Dubois, an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tried to do the flake the 
second day she ever climbed and didn't make it. But she has practiced hard and 
now makes the climb look simple. 
</P>
<P>
After scurrying down, she says in French-heavy English, "It eez such a great 
feeling to hold on to such a leeetle peez of zee rock." Then she goes and 
watches Delmas do a difficult under-cling maneuver on a section of Turlock 
that's beyond vertical. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to pack up and forget about crack jamming until tomorrow. Weil, 27, 
walks out of the park with her mother Bev, who was there to watch her climb. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I don't mind watching her because it's low," Mrs. Weil says. Not like 
Yosemite two years ago, when she couldn't bear to watch her daughter play on 
the rock walls at Tuolumne Meadows. "With binoculars it was OK, but not in too 
close," she says. And her basic rule for Rachel: "Don't tell me beforehand 
you're going climbing." 
</P>
<P>
Rachel laughs. "Mom actually deals very well with my rock climbing," she says. 
"It's difficult for any parent because it's a risk sport. But the risk is 
calculated and relatively safe. Most accidents could have been avoided." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why rock climbers don't linger in the park after dark. As Rachel and 
her mother walk to their cars, they hear a series of long, bloodcurdling howls 
from the top of the highest boulder. The rock heads have arrived. 
</P>

LOFRANO TAKES STEP UP WITH PIERCE POSITION; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL COACH LEAVES CHATSWORTH TO ACCEPT JOB AS COLLEGE ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Lofrano took a pay cut and his job title was declassified Thursday, but the 
former Chatsworth High baseball coach said that the move marked a step forward 
after he was introduced officially as a new assistant baseball coach at Pierce 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce has hired Lofrano as a physical education teacher, the first such hire 
at the school since Jim Fenwick joined the staff in 1975. Lofrano's position 
opened after four physical education teachers left the school because of an 
early retirement incentive program. 
</P>
<P>
The school was expected to have two positions available in the department, but 
only Lofrano has been hired. The academic committee that recommended Lofrano 
last week also recommended assistant football coach Bill Norton, who has joined 
the staff as a walk-on. Athletic Director Marian McWilliams said that the fate 
of the second position will be determined next week. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano, Chatsworth's head coach for the past 11 years, joins the Pierce staff 
as an assistant to Bob Lyons. Both downplayed the designation, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Titles are not an important distinction," Lyons said. "I don't like saying 
he's the assistant coach because his background doesn't warrant that. We're 
going to utilize his talents and he's got many of them." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons, 51, has coached at Pierce for 10 years in two stints. He left the 
program after the 1981 season and returned in 1987 when Pierce threatened to 
cut the program if a credentialed employee did not take the job. He said he has 
no plans to retire but hinted that Lofrano won't be an assistant for long. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob represents the future for Pierce," he said. "This has been a while in 
coming and I think it's a marvelous situation." 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano, 39, who did not reveal exact figures, said he doesn't mind taking a 
small pay cut for the opportunity to step up to the college level, especially 
at his alma mater. He played in the same Pierce infield with former major 
leaguer Doug DeCinces in 1968-69. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting into college baseball has always been a goal I had," he said. "I'm 
going to miss Chatsworth and that will always be special for me, but I'm really 
excited to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth has named no replacement for Lofrano, who has made no recommendation 
for a successor. His assistant last season, Joe Koh, has been hired as the head 
coach at L. A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano's first task at Pierce is recruiting and he expects to cash in on his 
prominence as a high school coach. In 11 years, he compiled a 188-59 record 
(.761 winning percentage) and led the Chancellors to nine consecutive West 
Valley League titles. Chatsworth won the City Section 4-A Division championship 
in 1983 and was ranked No. 1 in the country during the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano is scheduled to coach a high school all-star team in a friendship 
series Aug. 25-Sept. 5 in South Korea against national teams from Korea and 
Japan, but he said that he may bow out of that assignment to concentrate on his 
new job. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce has now hired two coaches since May -- Lofrano and Rob DiMuro, who is 
being asked to resurrect the women's basketball program. Pierce President Dan 
Means has vowed to reinstate the men's basketball program, and school officials 
say Lofrano's hiring sends a message to the community that the school is 
serious about its athletics programs.

"Things are on an upswing since we hit a trough about five years ago," Lyons 
said. "We were on the proverbial shoestring. Now, we had a chance to get a 
top-notch person and I think Pierce is making a real statement."

QUARTERBACK PLATT FAILS TO REPORT FOR AZTECS, MAY LEAVE TEAM

Brad Platt, San Diego State's backup quarterback, did not report for the first 
day of camp Thursday and may leave the team for personal reasons, Coach Al 
Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
Platt, who started seven games for the Aztecs last season, initiated a meeting 
with Luginbill Wednesday night, the eve of the first day of camp for SDSU's 66 
veterans. Platt and Luginbill discussed the situation for about an hour, and 
Platt said he wanted to leave the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not accept him quitting the football team," Luginbill said. "I told 
him I just wasn't going to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he wanted to meet with Platt Thursday. "He was supposed to come 
by and see me. It's now what, nine o'clock, and he hasn't been around. I don't 
even want to comment. It's not a done thing yet." 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if Platt met with Luginbill later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Platt was the only veteran who did not report for physicals, equipment, 
academic counseling and initial meetings with Luginbill and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Platt, who played at Southwestern Community College and Hilltop High School, 
threw for 1,466 yards last season, completing 130 of 226 passes. Platt was 
expected to battle freshmen quarterbacks Cree Morris and David Lowery for the 
No. 2 spot behind Dan McGwire, a transfer from Iowa who beat out Platt in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
There was some talk that Platt (6-feet-1, 210 pounds) might be switched to 
another position, such as receiver or defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of changes things rapidly," said Dave Lay, the offensive coordinator, 
of the possibility of losing Platt. 
</P>
<P>
If he should leave, Platt would be the third SDSU quarterback to do so in the 
past three months. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the first day of spring practice, Scott Barrick announced he was 
quitting because he lacked the necessary desire to continue playing. Barrick, a 
Fallbrook High graduate, has since enrolled at Palomar College where he will 
play for Coach Tom Craft, SDSU's quarterback in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
About a month later, Jack Skoog, who would have been a senior, announced his 
intention to transfer to Michigan State. Skoog also played baseball for the 
Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Platt who lives in Chula Vista, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill made it clear from the onset he would not tolerate out-of-shape 
players, implementing a mandatory off-season conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
"Friday morning will really be a day of reckoning for a lot of them," Luginbill 
said. "We will know how much conditioning they did. What has their commitment 
been to making this a good football team? They know what to expect from me now. 
There's no reason or excuse not to meet those expectations. It takes no ability 
or skill to get in shape." 
</P>
<P>
The first game of the season, at the Air Force Academy, is in 22 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of the players stuck to (their training programs)," said senior 
safety John Wesselman. "If you were in town like most of the guys were, you 
couldn't help but stick to it. I'm probably in the best shape I've been in 
coming into the fall." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Centers Steve Blyth and Bonner Montler are the only veterans expected to miss 
Saturday's first practice because of injury. Blyth is still recovering from a 
ruptured knee tendon that required surgery in May. Montler's second and third 
toes on his left foot are still smarting from a dirt bike accident this summer 
. . . Among the newcomers nursing injuries are receivers Will Tate (knee) and 
Tom Underwood (hamstring), offensive lineman Mike Alexander (hip) and defensive 
lineman George Tuioti (knee) . . . Because of the depth of the defensive line, 
Doug Blanchard and Eric Duncan will be moved to the offensive line and 
linebacker.

TENNIS PONDERS DEVELOPMENT OF PRODIGIES

<P>
If the potion for Michael Chang's rapid development and startling tennis 
success could be bottled and sold, many juniors and their parents would be 
running to drug stores. 
</P>
<P>
But as most aficionados know, 17-year-old Americans do not win the French Open 
every day, and there is no such thing as a quick way of creating elite tennis 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Smith, a former U.S. Open champion and now a U.S. Tennis Assn. coach, said 
Chang possesses several ingredients that most juniors could only dream about 
and never buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael had tremendous quickness and a very good mind," Smith said. "He was 
also much more mature than most people are at his age, and he has great courage 
-- which is what pulled him through the French Open." 
</P>
<P>
Chang's model for success is not one Smith advises the average junior to copy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not encourage kids to turn pro at that age," said Smith, referring to 
Chang's decision at 15. "I still believe he is an exception." 
</P>
<P>
So why do so many tennis parents push their sons and daughters to the physical 
and emotional limit? 
</P>
<P>
Why do they sometimes spend more than their budget can afford in search of 
largely unrealistic and unattainable goals? 
</P>
<P>
Many teaching pros say parents are attempting to satisfy their egos or reach a 
status they were never quite able to in their athletic careers. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Plunkett, head women's coach at San Diego State, says a little parent 
involvement is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"You need that to have an outstanding athlete," she said. "Telling a kid to 
play tennis for a certain amount of hours is no different than a parent setting 
aside an hour for piano or violin lessons." 
</P>
<P>
Curt Condon, teaching pro at the Vista Tennis Club, said Chang and some of the 
other young stars such as Andre Agassi and Aaron Krickstein have enjoyed 
success at early ages because of their upbringing. And there may be another one 
at tournaments such as this week's USTA Boys' 12s championships at Morley 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
"The good ones are a product of their environment," Condon said. "Look at the 
fathers of McEnroe (lawyer), Chang (biochemist). Those people have a certain 
formula, and they stick with it. They've taught their kids to sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
But not every junior has the hands and anticipation of McEnroe, the quickness 
of Chang or the ground strokes of Krickstein. Yet many tennis parents believe 
it is essential for their Jimmy or Chrissy to practice ground strokes five 
hours a day while their friends are going to dances, the beach or playing other 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
According to Angel Lopez, head pro at San Diego Racquet and Tennis Club, a 
junior must be atypical to burst onto the pro tennis scene the way Chang did. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael had the coaching, the talent, but most importantly, the 
single-mindedness," Lopez said. "He was not one to go to the beach or to the 
dances." 
</P>
<P>
Could there ever be another Michael Chang in the San Diego area? 
</P>
<P>
"It could happen again," Lopez said. "Michael had a tremendous amount of drive. 
San Diego has a lot of distractions. A kid's almost got to take it like a 
business to succeed. You can't steer away from that goal." 
</P>
<P>
Some parents and coaches look for results at younger and younger ages, putting 
more and more pressure on adolescents. All this has finally struck a nerve with 
the USTA, which is the reason for the downfall of the national 12s competition. 
This week's tournament in San Diego will be the last of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1990, the USTA will sponsor zonal team competitions with less 
emphasis put on rankings and results. They believe this will help to eliminate 
the temptation of many juniors to win points by playing strictly a baseline 
game, thus creating more of a serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're attempting to create a more-team oriented environment," said Pam 
Hartman, assistant to the director of player development for the USTA. "A lot 
of kids were more concerned about winning and improving their ranking than 
their game. It's no secret that that's not the way to a successful tennis 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Plunkett said she agrees with the steps the USTA is taking to curb burnout. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a correlation with a player's early success to how well they do 
down the line," she said. "The USTA's approach to better game development will 
give us greater players in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Condon is also a strong supporter of the USTA's new philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my way, I'd do whatever it takes to get round-robin tournaments in 
the 12s, 14s and 16s with no national rankings," Condon said. "It's going to 
allow a player to have excellent competition, and if they get beat, it's a 
learning process." 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Hillman, the director of development for the Southern California Tennis 
Assn., is not so sure eliminating the 12s is the answer to developing more 
well-rounded players. The SCTA will thus keep its 12s rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"My concerns are that we're competing with other sports," Hillman said. "A 
player has to know how he's progressing, and the rankings do that." 
</P>
<P>
Since turning 10, James Conda, now the No. 1-ranked 14-year-old in San Diego 
and Southern California, has not steered away from his goal of playing college 
and professional tennis. Ultimately, said Conda's father, Nick, James would 
like to enjoy the same success as Chang. 
</P>
<P>
But Nick Conda said he has tried to keep James' dream of being the next Michael 
Chang in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"James wants to follow in Michael's footsteps, but it's a long shot," Nick 
Conda said. "Michael was 100% tennis. I don't think I want to do that to 
James." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Dawson, Conda's coach at the Mission Hills YMCA, said he is careful not 
to overwork his young star. 
</P>
<P>
"I make him take a few days off," Dawson said. "I tell him to go to the beach 
and have some fun. My philosophy is: Train hard on the court, have fun off it. 
By my way of thinking, your whole life is not tennis." 
</P>
<P>
But Dawson admits that Conda will eventually have to become more serious about 
tennis if he is move his game to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
"James still treats tennis like a game," Dawson said. "In order to go to the 
next step, he has to turn it into a sport." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said it's too early to tell, but Conda has the potential to be another 
Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best I've ever coached," Dawson said. "He has an all-court game 
that's more versatile than Chang." 
</P>
<P>
Said James: "I admire Chang, but I play my own style. I come to the net more 
than he does." 
</P>
<P>
That aggressive style paid off for Conda this week in Shreveport, La., where he 
reached the fourth round of the USTA national hard court tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Conda said that lately, he has been trying to find a medium for his son. 
He wants to see James succeed, but not at the cost of his happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"At this age, James loves the game," Conda said. "I never push my kids. It's up 
to them. Before every (national) tournament, we ask him if he wants to play the 
tournament. All I can do is guide him. I tell him, 'If you feel that you don't 
want to play anymore, quit.' 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen parents who are more involved in the game than the kids. I think the 
kids have enough pressure on themselves, the parents don't need to add to it." 
</P>
<P>
"If I feel tired, I just take a rest," James said. "I'm not planning on getting 
burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Although Nick Conda has stayed away from instructing his son on the court, he 
has been at the forefront of managing James' career off the court. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Nick Conda realized his son might be something special, so he 
began to get tennis experts involved. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, Nick has picked up the tab for tennis lessons, summer trips to 
national tournaments and arranged for James' transfer to tennis powerhouse La 
Jolla High School. 
</P>
<P>
Although the USTA gives James spending money for national tournaments because 
of his high ranking, his father is required to pay for air fare and hotel 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Financially, it puts a strain on my budget," said Nick, whose family lives in 
Bonita. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been trying to get James away from peer pressure -- drugs and so forth. 
The game of tennis has steered him away from that." 
</P>
<P>
Ditta Huber is another local junior on the rise. Only 14, Huber is ranked first 
in San Diego in the girls' 18s, and she is among the top 10 16-year-olds in 
Southern California. Huber upset Leslie Hakala, a two-time All-American from 
Brigham Young, in the final of the Industry Hills tournament this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, who has worked with Huber, said she possesses many of the same 
attributes that led to Chang's rapid rise. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't socialize with other kids, and she's very goal-oriented," Dawson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the impressive results this summer, Huber said her plans do not 
include professional tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to play college tennis for Stanford," said Huber, who will be an 
eighth grader at Palo Verde Christian High School in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Huber said she understands how talented juniors like Angelica Gavaldon, a 
15-year-old at Our Lady Peace who participated in the recent Great American 
Bank women's tournament, might be tempted to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for some of the kids," Huber said. "They're so good that they have 
to get the competition somewhere. But then if they fail, they don't really have 
anything else. I don't know if tennis is worth ruining your whole life over." 
</P>
<P>
Curt Condon, the Vista pro, said that philosophy seems obvious but sometimes is 
not followed by the fanatical tennis parent. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so short-sighted," he said. "They've got to see the big picture. 
Through (the early years), you should be working towards improvement -- 
short-term goals. I believe in developing the whole person. Only 30 women make 
$100,000 a year. But this is America, and we're all looking for the pie-in-the 
sky."

HARRIS HAS GOTTEN STARTED, BUT RELIEF NOW IS WELCOME

<P>
When pitcher Greg Harris walked to the mound to start Thursday afternoon's game 
against Houston, he knew exactly what he wanted to do: Throw a changeup when 
the situation called for a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
That situation came up in the first inning. Two were out, and Bill Doran was 
standing at the plate with a three-and-one count. So Harris kicked, tossed a 
changeup and . . . ball four. 
</P>
<P>
Harris struck out the next batter, Glenn Davis. But he still trailed by a run 
after Doran stole second and scored when Benito Santiago's throw sailed into 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Padres came right back with four runs in the bottom of the first 
and went on to a 13-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
And Harris' statement was already made despite walking Doran. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to put it in the back of their minds that they would see something 
other than a fastball," Harris said. "In my first three starts, I used a 
fastball in a fastball situation. (The hitters) don't get paid for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Harris was predictable in those first three starts after he was thrust into the 
rotation when Eric Show's back gave out in late June. And so were the final 
results -- all losses. 
</P>
<P>
But he pitched well Thursday, allowing just three runs (two earned) and six 
hits in eight innings for his second consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
And for this, he will likely return to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"Chances are," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Said pitching coach Pat Dobson: "We're going to use him in the bullpen in New 
York next week. The first time we'll need a fifth starter isn't until Saturday 
in Montreal. Actually, we don't have to make a decision until Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' first four starters are Bruce Hurst, Dennis Rasmussen, Ed Whitson 
and new addition Andy Benes. Don Schulze will likely remain the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that Harris is being banished to the bullpen. That's where the Padres 
like him. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is people think I'm being demoted," Harris said. "I don't look 
at it that way. Me and Mark Grant come in in key situations, we split things. 
Everybody is almost looking down on it, and that sort of hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be a part of winning. If there's a situation where I can become 
a great part of the team as a reliever, I prefer that. When you start, it's 
almost sentimental. It's my turn to pitch, here's the ball, go out there and 
win my game. There are times I want to be a starter." 
</P>
<P>
Harris has appeared in 36 Padre games this season, starting five. Overall, he 
is 5-6 with a 2.76 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first became a starter, he didn't carry his aggressiveness from the 
bullpen to the mound," Dobson said. "In the last two games, he has been 
aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
That's because, Harris said, he has learned a few things about how to pitch. He 
uses all four of his pitches -- fastball, curve, changeup and slider -- when he 
starts. When he relieves, he can rely on the fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to establish yourself earlier in the game when you start," Harris 
said. "As a starter, you have to adjust throughout the game." 
</P>
<P>
That's what Harris did Thursday. His only rough inning was the fifth, when he 
gave up two runs on three hits. And that, he thought, was because he quit using 
his changeup in the third when the Padres were ahead, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, I was in a bases-loaded situation, and I didn't have the feel 
for my changeup anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he battled, kept the ball low and was able to get out of a jam. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he ran his career record to 4-0 vs. Houston. He had a season-high 
seven strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, people could say, 'Well, they've never seen him,"' said Harris, who 
won two of those games against Houston last September. "Now, I've faced them. 
They know what I'm doing. It makes you feel like an established pitcher."

COMPELLING CAST OF CHARACTERS IN 'SEX, LIES . . . VIDEOTAPE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

With enviable single-mindedness, the two handsome couples in Steven 
Soderbergh's electrifying psycho-sexual comedy occupy themselves with sex, with 
lies and with videotape, in a film of exactly that name. It's the funniest and 
saddest American movie since Jim Jarmusch landed straight in the middle of our 
consciousness, and it's possibly the most compelling. ("Sex, lies and 
videotape" is now opening at San Diego area theaters.) 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in a therapy session, with the deceptively offhanded remark by a 
beautiful young wife (Andie MacDowell) that everything is fine in her marriage, 
except that she's, well, "kinda going through this thing where I don't want him 
to touch me," the secrets that tumble out are commonplace enough. They're the 
stuff that Dear Abby readers drink in with their morning coffee; they are also 
a catalogue of upscale affliction: infidelity, obsession, jealousy, impotence, 
sexual repression and a large dollop of voyeurism. 
</P>
<P>
It's Soderbergh's elegant manner of revealing these . . . contemporary 
inconveniences, and of pushing his characters into deeper and deeper 
psychological water, that creates the film's tranquil spell. As writer, 
director and editor, his control is mesmerizing. It's also more than a little 
creepy; as though Soderbergh were drawing us, a step at a time, into a warm 
pool where intimate secrets flowed back and forth as simply as currents of 
water. Feel uneasy about what you may hear? Lie back and float, everything will 
be all right. 
</P>
<P>
Well, although this isn't Brian De Palma voyeurism or David Lynch creepiness, 
sometimes it feels as though nothing will be all right. With brilliant economy, 
Soderbergh lets us see that MacDowell's husband (Peter Gallagher) is a creep in 
a three-piece suit, that her perfect marriage is a hollow disaster and that she 
is sleepwalking to keep from knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
And that's before Gallagher's old college buddy (James Spader) arrives for a 
visit. The men make unlikely friends today. The 
</P>
<P>
ultimate yuppie puppy, Gallagher has the arrogance that comes with being a law 
partner at 30, and the sexual combativeness that's led him into a volcanic 
affair with an artist-cum-bartender (Laura San Giacomo), who happens to be his 
wife's younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
Blond and quiet-spoken, Spader is open, disingenuously inquiring, almost a '60s 
throwback -- the sort who takes pride in his lack of possessions. Though there 
is every reason to believe that he is a trust-fund bum, he has blown into Baton 
Rouge with little more than a change of clothes, a beater convertible, his 
video camera and a couple of boxes of personal videotapes. If there is 
something intense about him that puts people off-balance, there is an equal 
quality that makes them trust him. Especially women. 
</P>
<P>
He intrigues MacDowell, volunteered by her husband to help Spader find an 
apartment. It might be a classic setup, except that, as Spader explains to her 
over a delicately probing lunch, he is impotent. Or at least he can't get an 
erection in the presence of another person, which is as good as impotence. If 
this disclosure widens her lovely eyes, wait until she asks him idly what's on 
all his tapes, each with a girl's name? And to what use he puts them? 
</P>
<P>
And that is Soderbergh's setup. What is not apparent from a thumbnail 
description is the film's lacerating wit, its beautiful look and sound, and the 
bravura quality to each performance. Or the terrible vein of melancholy that 
Soderbergh touches. 
</P>
<P>
It's also worth mentioning that only one character in four (MacDowell) could be 
called sympathetic. The perfectly matched Gallagher and San Giacomo deserve one 
another, and isn't Spader's helpless voyeurism pathetic? Weird? Bizarro? 
Perhaps, but that will become the fulcrum of the story. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that "sex, lies and videotape," as well as Spader, took the 
Golden Palm at Cannes this spring, although it's sad that MacDowell's supple, 
shaded brilliance went unrewarded. This is an American movie that feels French. 
All this low-key unburdening of sexual trauma. All this talk, punctuated by all 
these bedroom gymnastics, and not a lethal weapon in sight. (Actually, not a 
lot of nudity, either, for a film as drenched in sex as this one, MPAA-rated R. 
It's Gallagher's character who is crass; his creator is discreet.) 
</P>
<P>
If "sex, lies" did not go on to crash through a pair of long-standing 
psychological barriers as definitively as it does, it would be as creepy as 
Spader appears to be, as impotently teasing and as uselessly intimate. It's 
Soderbergh's ability to push his story to its furthest limits that makes it so 
arresting. 
</P>
<P>
Before it burst on Cannes, "sex, lies and videotape" knocked filmgoers into the 
snowbanks at the U.S. Film Festival in Park City, Utah, coincidentally with a 
complete retrospective of John Cassavetes' career. 
</P>
<P>
It might seem that, in his own distinct way, Soderbergh is the young American 
director most clearly in the vein of the dark, deeply missed Cassavetes. Both 
men, from the very first films of their careers, have demanded that we take a 
real look at our lives behind the "Shadows," or insulated by "sex, lies and 
videotape."

THE GRAINS OF TRUTH IN A BUDDHIST SAND PAINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kalachakra Wheel of Time is a sacred sand painting that Tibetan Buddist 
monks have been making since 600 BC. First produced by the Buddha himself as 
part of a religious teaching known as the Kalachakra Tantra, the Wheel of Time 
contains 722 deities, each of which is represented by a specific visual symbol. 
Traditionally executed by two shifts of 16 monks working over four days, this 
magnificent and intricate artwork is simply swept away upon completion. The 
monks believe the best way to preserve its meaning and power is to dismantle 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, you won't find a sand mandala in the permanent collection of 
any local museum because the idea of preservation is at odds with the art form. 
To see a sand mandala is a rare privilege; to see Tibetan monks actually making 
one is another experience altogether. Angelenos can do both at the Museum of 
Natural History, where four monks from the Dalai Lama's Namgyal Monastery in 
Dharamsala, India, will be at work on the Wheel of Time through Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Presented by the Samaya Foundation in conjunction with the Dalai Lama's visit 
to Los Angeles last month (he came to offer the Kalachakra teachings), the 
Wheel of Time is a vehicle of peace and enlightenment believed to instill 
tranquillity in the hearts of those who view it. If the monks who have been at 
work at the museum since July 6 are any evidence of the mandala's power, it 
inarguably bequeaths tranquillity on those it touches. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning their day's work with half an hour of chanted prayer, the monks are 
in a state of meditation as they start work on the mandala and quite beautiful 
to watch. Serene and endlessly patient in their labors, they exude a quiet 
contentment rarely seen in the frenzied Western world. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you enjoy this work?" one monk is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes, very much," he answers beaming, as attempts to teach an 11-year-old 
boy how to handle sand painting tools (the sand painting exhibition also 
includes how-to demonstrations and related videotapes of the Dalai Lama). 
</P>
<P>
When it first appeared in India in 600 BC, sand painting was done using the 
fingers, but the clever Tibetans improved on that technique when they took up 
the art form in the 11th Century. Devising metal funnels called chakpus, which 
are gently rasped with a second funnel to tap out colored sand, Tibetan monks 
weave their richly colored tapestry out of sand that is, in fact, crushed stone 
dyed with opaque water-based pigment. 
</P>
<P>
The monks begin by painting the central image of Kalachakra (a manifestation of 
the Buddha) and his consort Vishvamat, then develop the image outward. They sit 
at their work when the mandala is in its early stages, then stand as it nears 
completion. Though the idea of artistic ego is distinctly at odds with Tibetan 
Buddhism, the Wheel of Time varies from one to the next, and there is room 
within this highly revered composition for subtle passages of personal 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
Seven feet across in its finished form, the mandala is structured as a series 
of concentric circles surrounding a complex network of symbols leading to a 
many chambered palace. The circles protect the palace and represent wisdom, 
space, wind, fire, water and earth, while the innermost circle features a dozen 
gateways (symbolizing body, speech and mind) that lead deeper into the palace. 
Mind is the main passageway to the center of the palace, where the Buddha sits 
on a lotus blossom in a state of perpetual bliss. 
</P>
<P>
This is only the second time this sacred art form has been seen in the United 
States (the Wheel of Time was completed in New York last summer). The closing 
ritual at the museum begins at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday and will commence with 
prayers requesting the deities to return to their celestial abode. The symbolic 
representations of the deities are then plucked from the mandala by the monks 
who place them in an urn. 
</P>
<P>
The energy of the mandala is then "cut" and the remaining sand, believed to 
have a special power, is swept into an urn which will be taken to the Santa 
Monica Bay Sand and Sea Club where it will be poured into the ocean for the 
benefit of marine life. The dismantling of the mandala is considered an 
exercise in non-attachment and letting go of the mind self. 
</P>
<P>
Who among us can't use a little of that?

ACERBIC MURPHY FIRED FROM Q106 A.M. TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Murphy, half of the acerbic KKLQ (Q106) morning team of Murphy and 
McKeever, was fired from the show Thursday after what he described as a 
long-running series of disagreements with management. 
</P>
<P>
Program Director Garry Wall said Murphy, who is still under contract, was taken 
off the air for "philosophical differences." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said his relationship with the station, in particular Wall, had been 
strained for several months. 
</P>
<P>
When he signed a three-year contract in 1987, after leaving a job with a highly 
rated station in New York City, Murphy said he was told his contract would be 
renegotiated after a year and a new production booth would be built at the 
station. Murphy said the promises were never kept, even though he often 
reminded management of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It became apparent that we were not going to reach a mutual decision to stay 
together," Wall said. "We decided to face that and be honest. The relationship 
was not positive at that point on the air." 
</P>
<P>
There were no specific on-air instances leading to the dismissal, said Wall, 
who will replace Murphy on the air, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy will be paid for the remaining time on his contract, which runs until 
March, and he is technically still employed by the station, but his days on the 
air are definitely over, Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was on the air Monday but called in sick Tuesday and Wednesday. He was 
planning to come in Thursday but instead was told by management to attend a 
lunch meeting. At the meeting with General Manager Bob Bolinger and Wall, 
Murphy was told he was being taken off the air. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided I was faking," Murphy said. "They called me a liar and told me I 
was trying to sabotage the station." 
</P>
<P>
Wall said Murphy's illness had nothing to do with the station's decision. 
</P>
<P>
With a mix of skits, outlandish pranks and teen-oriented dance music, Murphy 
and partner Terry McKeever became one of San Diego's top-rated morning teams 
shortly after hitting the airwaves in March, 1987. They were known as much for 
their ability to generate controversy as for their ratings prowess. Frequent 
targets were the "dummies in the news," in particular Mayor Maureen O'Connor, 
Steve Garvey and local television celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Along with McKeever, Murphy was the most visible representative of the station, 
willing to do just about any type of stunt to attract attention. Last year they 
had themselves dipped in chocolate and covered with sprinkles for a charity 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of his contract, Murphy won't be able to negotiate for another 
job before his contract expires without the station's permission. There is also 
a clause that says he can't go to a competing station for a year after the end 
of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just going to try to relax and enjoy this vacation," Murphy said. "I feel 
sorry, No. 1 because I've been denied the opportunity to thank the people who 
listen to us, and to say goodby."

NBC's "The Golden Girls" and the film "Mississippi Burning" have been given 
Golden Pit Awards for negative stereotyping by a coalition of ethnic groups in 
New York City. "We want the producers of this material to be more sensitive. In 
their quest to entertain, they often contribute to negative stereotyping," said 
William Fugazy, honorary chairman of the National Ethnic Coalition of 
Organizations. "Mississippi Burning," a drama about the 1964 slayings of three 
civil rights workers, was cited for "downplaying the role of blacks . . . and 
portraying them as helpless during the civil rights struggle." "The Golden 
Girls" was selected for the "constant barrage of negative Italian and Sicilian 
diatribes" spoken by the Italian character Sofia Petrillo. Spike Lee's "Do the 
Right Thing" received a special Platinum Pit Award for "advocating violence as 
a way to resolve conflict".ALEENE MacMINN

The National Stuttering Project has won a slight victory in its beef with the 
movie "A Fish Called Wanda," which features a character who stutters. Dimension 
Cable TV in Orange County, which is carrying the film this month, is airing a 
public disclaimer on its community-access channel. The 10-second, typewritten 
disclaimer, taken from a letter written by "Fish" producer Michael Shamberg, 
states, "The film makers of 'A Fish Called Wanda' do not want viewers to draw 
any negative inferences about people who stutter or be misinformed about the 
nature of the disorder." The disclaimer is airing in the mornings with other 
community-service announcements. ALEENE MacMINN

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: JOACHIM SPLICHAL BRINGS HIS SPECIAL TOUCH TO PATINA

One of the most eagerly awaited restaurants of the year has finally opened. 
Joachim Splichal, who made Beverly Hills' Max au Triangle famous, has taken 
over the former Le St. Germain and turned it into Patina. The address is 5955 
Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. The number: (213) 467-1108. 
</P>
<P>
This was worth waiting for. The restaurant's barely been open a week, but it is 
already clear that Splichal's food is as exciting as it ever was, that the 
small restaurant manages to be both modern and intimate and that the prices are 
fair (entrees hover around the $20 mark). 
</P>
<P>
After one visit I can recommend the appetizer of Santa Barbara shrimp with 
mashed potatoes and truffle chips, the very peppered tuna with Asian accents 
that is served atop a tangle of vegetables, and the spectacular peach galette 
for dessert. And I can tell you that I am really looking forward to eating my 
way through the rest of the menu. RUTH REICHL

A FINE, FULL TASTE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AT FINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fino has a new fusion cuisine for us: pan-Mediterranean, mixing the Italian and 
Provencale styles that play so well in California with Spanish, Greek, Balkan 
and even Lebanese ideas. It's a big, sunburned, backslapping cuisine full of 
our favorite things -- eggplant, saffron, pine nuts, dried tomatoes, garlic, 
fresh herbs and seafood. Maybe a little more emphasis on lamb and cured meats. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, olive oil and pungent imported olives. The first things you get when 
you sit down at Fino are a little bowl of strongly flavored purplish-black 
olives and another of roasted garlic cloves in a pool of jade-green oil. 
</P>
<P>
The menu changes somewhat every day, but you might be able to follow that dose 
of olives with an antipasto of cooked and raw vegetables, roughly cut cured 
meats, and an army of olives. Or a plate of crostini topped with eggplant 
puree, garbanzo puree, a mixture of chopped tomatoes and basil (olives baked 
into the bread on that one) and just plain olives minced with garlic. And then 
perhaps half a duck in a meaty sauce flavored with thyme and olives, or a sea 
bass baked in a crust of crushed olives. 
</P>
<P>
Whew. This is the kind of fun they're serving up at this self-described "rustic 
bistro" in Torrance. Inside, the place is dominated by a mural of well-dressed 
people who could be Spanish, Italian or Greek having a party that looks 
balanced between sophistication and boisterousness. 
</P>
<P>
And I suppose that's where the food balances a lot of the time too. Sweet 
grilled shrimp with austere white Tuscan beans and a riotous garlicky 
mayonnaise colored with sun-dried tomatoes. A whole head of dignified escarole, 
grilled (yes, grilled) and sprinkled with Parmesan, bread crumbs and garlic, 
plus some fried prosciutto. Or this: a strip of mirepoix, the sweet cooked 
carrots and celery chastely mediating between a well-done lamb shank in intense 
Madeira wine reduction on one side and a sea of diced potatoes fried with 
garlic and rosemary on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The most pan-Mediterranean thing I've had at Fino, I suppose, is the farfalle 
pasta with ground lamb, pine nuts and arugula in a tiny bit of sour cream 
flecked with red pepper. The most peasanty was probably rabbit braised in a 
winey sauce thickened with pine nuts. The most Westsidey must have been grilled 
tuna with toasted almonds in a saffron sauce garnished with mint. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, sated with peppery calamari and deep-fried frog legs with 
vinegar and hazelnut sauce, I would expect Fino to rest on its laurels in the 
dessert department, but several of the desserts are outstanding. I've had an 
unbeatable mascarpone cheesecake with a crunchy hazelnut crust and a "tart" 
that was just a square of puff paste topped with thin-sliced plums, floating on 
fresh caramel sauce with the odd macadamia nut in it. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, when I think of Fino I think of those dark olives, whose 
haunting bitter taste reminded Lawrence Durrell of "the whole Mediterranean, 
the sculpture, the palms, the gold beads, the bearded heroes, the wine, the 
ideas, the ships, the moonlight, the winged gorgons, the bronzed men, the 
philosophers. . . . A taste older than meat, older than wine. A taste as old as 
cold water." 
</P>
<P>
I can put up with that sort of food all day. Fino is as enjoyable as I ever 
expect a restaurant to be. 
</P>
<P>
Fino, 24530 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance. (213) 373-1952. Open for dinner Monday 
through Saturday. Wine and beer. Parking in lot. Visa, MasterCard and American 
Express. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$60.

Get out your spoons. Ready your forks. And bring along your dancing shoes too. 
The fourth annual Taste of L.A. starts Saturday at Santa Monica's Civic Center, 
offering an opportunity to sample food from 50 of the finest restaurants in 
town. The festival runs this weekend and next from noon-11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to more food than you'll probably be able to taste, there will be 
cooking demonstrations, an art festival and constant entertainment. Admission 
is $8 for adults, $4 for children, $6 for senior citizens; tastes are priced at 
$1-$5, and 10% of the gross on-site proceeds goes to various organizations that 
aid the homeless. RUTH REICHL

DOMESTIC CRISIS FOR A JAMAICAN MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agonizing plight of Jamaican immigrants to Canada is the subject of "Milk 
and Honey" (at the Fine Arts), a well-intentioned, particularly well-acted film 
that falls apart before its midpoint and finishes with soap opera flourishes. A 
pity, because its star, Josette Simon, is as much a find as "Mona Lisa's" Cathy 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Like Joanna Bell (Simon), many of the women who emigrate have been lured by 
promises of comfortable money as nannies and instead find themselves virtual 
indentured servants. Joanna has powerful reasons for leaving her small Jamaican 
town; a single mother, she doesn't want to see her 6-year-old son, David 
(Richard Mills), raised in rural poverty. In a wrenching parting, Joanna leaves 
him with her mother, and in one day makes the jump from the tropics to a 
Toronto with snowdrifts in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural differences are almost as severe, and directors Rebecca Yates and 
Glen Salzman make those absolutely clear in the first sequences. To Joanna, 
this gleaming clean nanny's room with its own bath seems amazing; we may notice 
that the heating duct runs right through it, and it seems to be a conduit for 
the family's television sound, but this and a salary of $225 each week seems 
like heaven. 
</P>
<P>
But her first paycheck, minus all the allowable deductions -- her air fare, 
paid off in installments, a pension plan, the $70 per week they charge her for 
room and board -- is $20. And, talking to other nannies in the park, she finds 
that she's as caught as they all are. Until she gets papers as a "landed 
immigrant," which can be years, she is a "foreign domestic," earning a fixed 
$126.40 per week and forbidden to do any other kind of work. 
</P>
<P>
And so we skip two years. Joanna, whose hair is now handsomely cropped close to 
her head, is still working for the same unfeeling middle-class couple who now 
have two babies, and she is savvy, isolated and desperately lonely, her church 
her only bulwark. The screenplay, by Trevor Rhone and Salzman, makes 
superficial attempts to characterize her other friends: the warm and pious Miss 
Emma (Leonie Forbes), bosomy Maureen (Jane Dingle) the Liverpudlian, and the 
lively Del (Djanet Sears) clearly heading down the primrose path with her 
con-man boyfriend (Errol Slue), known as Mr. Fix-It for his way with 
immigration scams. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna has also had an almost-disastrous encounter with a night-school teacher, 
Adam Bernardi (Lyman Ward), who makes a clumsy pass at her. All these story 
threads will come together when Joanna brings her son, now 8, up for Christmas 
holidays, then impulsively, decides she cannot bear to send him back and will 
try to keep him in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"Milk and Honey" may be a bit flat-footed and didactic in its opening; at least 
that section tracks and the material is interesting. By the second half, 
contrivance is all, and it feels as though gaping chunks had been left out, 
particularly in the relationship between Joanna and Adam, who resurfaces as 
principal of the school in which she registers the truant David. 
</P>
<P>
It goes now from drama to melodrama to semi-love story to seeming tragedy with 
an atrocious upbeat ending in Jamaica that solves nothing and makes you wonder 
for the sanity of the people involved. Salvageable are the performances of 
Djanet Sears as the unexpectedly malevolent Del, and Ward, whom you may 
remember as the sought-after senior executive fox-trotting his way to success 
in "Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall." And, of course Simon, a member of 
London's Royal Shakespeare Company, who will some day have material worthy of 
her. SHEILA BENSON

THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A domesticated, gallery-tamed brand of violence informs bronze pedestal 
sculptures by Laura W. Russell. Jagged triangles bend in half and pierce 
themselves, and smooth-edged ribbons of metal wind through tattered and 
hole-ridden metal planes. But most everything is patinated in watery blue, 
green, rose or yellow, and each self-contained bronze whirlwind sits politely 
on a small base perched on sleek long metal legs. 
</P>
<P>
Russell started out as a painter, edging into sculpture by working first with 
paper and then bent plywood. The painted wood pieces eventually grew into 
massive, aggressive wall sculptures that sometimes included areas of painted 
wall. But it looks as though a lot of the energy of those works has drained 
away in the bronzes. Rather than grabbing the space around them, the new works 
are oddly self-contained. Their spiky edges have the look of calculated, flirty 
garnishes, their overall structure has been simplified into formula, and even 
their colors are sweeter. The net effect suggests a guileless bid to woo the 
interior decorator crowd. (Marilyn Butler Gallery, 910 Colorado Ave., to Aug. 
31.) CATHY CURTIS

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Hanks' star power helped "The 'Burbs" (MCA, $89.95, PG) make $34 million at 
movie theaters earlier this year -- and it needed the help. Directed by Joe 
Dante, this juvenile comedy with bad neighbors and worse taste also stars Bruce 
Dern, Rick Ducommon and Carrie Fisher. Times film critic Kevin Thomas found it 
"grimly unfunny." 
</P>
<P>
Also rolling into theaters earlier this year was "Gleaming the Cube" (Vestron, 
$89.98, PG-13), in which a skateboarder tries to find his brother's murderer. 
Christian Slater, Steven Bauer and Richard Herd star. 
</P>
<P>
From 1972, "Pete 'n' Tillie" (MCA, $79.95, PG) stars Walter Matthau as a 
bachelor whose wild ways are tested when he marries a secretary (Carol 
Burnett). From 1967, "Devil's Angels" (Trylon, $69.95) is a cheap motor-psycho 
movie starring John Cassavetes and shouldn't be confused with the same year's 
superiorly lurid "Hell's Angels on Wheels" (with Jack Nicholson). 
</P>
<P>
Trylon has also just released two other AIP cult films from the '60s for $69.95 
each, "Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine," starring Vincent Price, and 
"Pajama Party," starring Annette Funicello and Tommy Kirk, as well as the 1988 
independent comedy "The Beer Drinker's Guide to Fitness and Filmmaking" 
($89.95, PG). 
</P>
<P>
This week's top repriced video: "Rambo III" (IVE) falls to $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
Other New Videos 
</P>
<P>
Is it too early for Christmas videos? Family Home Entertainment doesn't think 
so. This week FHE releases four Yuletide tapes (previously shown on TV) for 
$14.95: "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (the "Animagic" musical version 
narrated by Burl Ives, 53 minutes), "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (narrated 
by Fred Astaire, 53 minutes), "Little Drummer Boy" (with the voices of Greer 
Garson, Jose Ferrer and the Vienna Boys Choir, 30 minutes), and "Frosty the 
Snowman" (narrated by Jimmy Durante, 30 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
Video-game helpers: MPI has released the second volume of its "Secret Video 
Game Tricks, Codes &amp; Strategies" ($14.95, 45 minutes). It focuses on 
Nintendo-compatible games, as does "Video Game Guide" (Studio Video, $9.99, 40 
minutes). For information on the latter tape, call (800) 541-1843. TERRY

CD CORNER: 58 ROLLING STONES SINGLES COMING OUT ON CD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Stones' new music -- the "Steel Wheels" album -- won't be in stores 
until Aug. 29, two days before the start in Philadelphia of the British rock 
band's first U.S. tour in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the Stones' classic material is showcased in a three-disc boxed set 
that will be released Tuesday by ABKCO Records. "The Rolling Stones Singles 
Collection: The London Years," which will also be available in vinyl and 
cassette sets, contains both sides of every Stones single released in this 
country or England between 1963 and 1971. 
</P>
<P>
That adds up to 58 singles, stretching from the quintet's first, U.K.-only 
single -- a remake of Chuck Berry's "Come On" on one side and Willie Dixon's "I 
Want to Be Loved" on the other -- through the remarkable string of mid-'60s 
hits, including "Satisfaction," "Let's Spend the Night Together" and "Honky 
Tonk Woman." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the set -- expected to retail for about $60 in the CD version -- 
includes an illustrated, 72-page booklet, featuring the lyrics of every song 
plus liner notes and recording-session data. 
</P>
<P>
For casual Stones fans who may be only marginally interested in the relatively 
obscure flip sides of some of the band's landmark hits, the already available 
"Hot Rocks" CD may be a better buy. The two-disc set, which retails for about 
$30, contains 21 of the band's best-known numbers. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new three-hour set is an essential package for hard-core Stones 
fans. The tracks are mostly in the original mono and all digitally remastered 
from the original tapes under the supervision of producer Andrew Oldham.

DRILLING PANEL WEIGHS LOCAL SMOG CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL and MAURA DOLAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Bush Administration task force on offshore drilling is seriously considering 
a proposal to subject oil platforms off the Southern California coast to 
pollution regulations set by local authorities, according to a task force 
document and sources close to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive attention being given to the proposal, which primarily would 
affect new offshore oil platforms, provides another strong indication that the 
task force will urge the government to reaffirm its plans for further drilling 
off the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
A decision to tighten pollution-control regulations for such rigs could help 
minimize opposition to any offshore drilling recommended by the task force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signal a Victory for AQMD 
</P>
<P>
It also would signal a victory for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District and other governmental units, which have sought to wrest control over 
offshore emissions from the less-restrictive Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
If issued in conjunction with an endorsement of new oil exploration, however, 
it would fall short of the outright moratorium advocated by anti-drilling 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Making offshore rigs subject to local rules would simply indicate that they 
got a firm grasp on the obvious," said Leslie Gainer, a spokesman for the 
environmentalist American Oceans Campaign. "What they need to do is set aside 
areas for permanent protection (from) leasing." 
</P>
<P>
A task force progress report, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, makes 
no formal recommendations and simply describes the pollution-control plan as 
one of several options under consideration as ways to reduce the environmental 
consequences of any new drilling. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials said the proposal is under serious consideration 
and indicated that it is likely to be adopted as part of the panel's 
recommendations in a final report to President Bush at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Because most existing offshore oil rigs in the Los Angeles area are located in 
waters already subject to local control, the plan would be of great 
significance only if new drilling were to proceed in additional areas 
controlled by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, an AQMD official said Thursday, emissions from new drilling 
platforms off Southern California could spew more than 16 tons of 
smog-producing pollutants into the atmosphere each day by early in the next 
century unless the air quality board gains regulatory authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration panel, chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., was 
directed to determine whether the government should proceed with its 
controversial drilling plans off Southern California and in other areas off 
Northern California and south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress Report 
</P>
<P>
Its progress report, which is to be published in the Federal Register today, 
states that the panel is still considering all options presented to it. They 
range from imposing a permanent ban on oil exploration in the areas to allowing 
the Interior Department to proceed unhindered with its drilling plans. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the document, however, is devoted to discussion of measures that would 
allow oil exploration to proceed, albeit with more stringent controls than now 
exist. Some of the plans mentioned would prohibit drilling in certain areas, 
but most would add new regulations designed to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the Southern California area, officials said, the task force has 
devoted the bulk of its time to options designed to minimize air pollution 
caused by new drilling in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question that air quality is the primary issue in 
the public mind," said Richard Glynn, the panel's deputy executive director. 
</P>
<P>
A task force decision to recommend new drilling in Southern California would 
come as little surprise to anti-drilling activists, who have charged that the 
panel is predisposed to favor oil exploration. In addition, many have 
acknowledged that the proposed Southern California offshore exploration area is 
the least environmentally sensitive of those under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
Whether the pollution-control plan is ultimately approved could depend largely 
on the efforts of the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, which 
currently regulates emissions from oil rigs drilling in the Outer Continental 
Shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to maintain that control, the agency earlier this year proposed 
tightening its own regulations. But even that effort has come under fire from 
local officials, who contend that the measures remain inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential stumbling block could arise in late October, when the 
National Academy of Sciences provides the panel with an advisory report on oil 
exploration. If the scientific body raises strong objections to further 
drilling, the task force could be forced to reconsider its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A South Coast AQMD official reaffirmed Thursday that the district would like 
the authority to control oil rig emissions if Bush proceeds with proposals to 
drill off the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we need to have stringent controls over offshore platforms," 
said spokesman Bill Kelly. "One of our concerns is how do we get those 
stringent controls in place when we don't have authority to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Contributors 
</P>
<P>
The emissions from oil rigs would be only a small fraction of the 7,700 tons of 
pollutants spewed into the Los Angeles Basin each day by cars, industries, 
airplanes and other sources. But most pollution sources are by themselves 
relatively small contributors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small amount, but the problem is that everywhere we look, the amounts 
are small with the exception of the car," Kelly said. "It's important that we 
get the reductions wherever we can. If we have the technology to reduce 
pollution, we need to put it in place, and for offshore oil drilling, there is 
the technology." 
</P>
<P>
Proposed oil drilling lease sales for Southern California call for about 10 to 
15 drilling platforms with 30 to 40 wells each, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Jehl reported from Washington and Dolan from Los Angeles.

SUCCESSOR TO FLAMBOYANT CORONER NOGUCHI TARGET OF MISMANAGEMENT CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was just a few years ago that Los Angeles County's self-styled "Coroner to 
the Stars," Dr. Thomas T. Noguchi, was demoted for poor management of the busy 
medical examiner/coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of court battles in which Noguchi failed to get back his job, 
the flamboyant former coroner settled into a job as a pathologist at County-USC 
Medical Center. Now, his successor, Ronald N. Kornblum, who took over the 
office in 1982, finds himself and his agency under intense scrutiny by county 
and outside investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, there are allegations of poor management and criminal activity. 
Some of the scrutiny was initiated by Kornblum himself, who hired a special 
investigator to look into reports of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulting Team Hired 
</P>
<P>
How well the coroner's office is managed is being studied by the county 
auditor-controller's office and a private management-consulting team hired by 
the Board of Supervisors in June in response to growing complaints. The aim of 
the private firm's study is to determine whether the office is "providing 
effective and efficient services." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is investigating whether coroner's office 
employees helped mortuaries perpetuate a double-billing fraud involving 
indigent veterans. Another case involves drivers for a defunct trucking firm 
who were using phony county identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
Other incidents referred to the district attorney's office include: 
</P>
<P>
* Possible thefts from bodies by a coroner's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
* Illegal use of a coroner's identification card to free someone from jail in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
* Possible kickbacks to a coroner's employee from a private firm that finds 
heirs. 
</P>
<P>
* The discovery of a coroner's employee with burglar's tools near a looted Los 
Angeles residence from which a body had recently been removed. 
</P>
<P>
* The arrest of a coroner's investigative aide in a Memphis, Tenn., airport in 
the company of a person with a large amount of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert H. MacKenzie, who works in the prosecutor's major 
frauds unit, is in charge of all criminal inquiries involving the coroner. He 
declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Blame Kornblum 
</P>
<P>
But one former coroner's employee, who has been cooperating with investigators, 
told The Times: "There are people in the coroner's office who should be in jail 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Some blame Kornblum for the department's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Dr. Sharon I. Schnittker, a deputy medical examiner for 14 years 
who resigned last fall to work for the Utah Medical Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
"He's extremely aloof," Schnittker said. "He didn't attend doctors' meetings. 
It was very difficult to discuss ongoing problems with him. . . . For me it 
just reached an intolerable level. I found the whole environment just totally 
chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not His Strong Suit 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum acknowledges that administration is not his strong suit. "I'm a 
scientific person," he said. As for his administrative abilities, he said: 
"I've never had any formal training. If I have an Achilles' heel, that's where 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
But his bosses apparently disagree. Given the pressures that Kornblum must 
endure in the face of a growing workload and the problems he inherited from the 
Noguchi era, the current coroner has done remarkably well, some officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, Dr. Kornblum has done an excellent job in running a very 
difficult department," said Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative 
officer. "He gets high marks as a pathologist and, given the constraints, high 
marks as an administrator." 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, county agency heads have been rated on their 
performances and given pay raises by the Board of Supervisors based on these 
evaluations. Dixon said performance ratings played a role in raising Kornblum's 
salary to its current annual level of about $118,000 from $103,000, his pay 
level when he was named permanent coroner on May 29, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Performing Satisfactorily' 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear he has been performing satisfactorily or he would not have received 
the increases he got," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Dixon said, the coroner's office filled the long-dormant 
post of chief deputy, giving the office a full-time administrator. 
</P>
<P>
During Noguchi's 15 years as coroner, he frequently clashed with county 
supervisors over his running of the department. Given to holding press 
conferences whenever celebrities became coroner's cases and to taking on lots 
of outside consulting work, Noguchi headed a department that was "basically 
running itself," according to a county auditor. The office had a big backlog of 
cases, the auditor found, and a lax security system had apparently allowed 
coroner's employees to steal valuables and drugs from bodies and death scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum heads what has become the nation's third-busiest coroner's office, 
behind New York City and Chicago's Cook County. It handled 17,825 cases last 
year. Its 16 doctors, including Kornblum, performed 9,027 post-mortems, 
including 6,218 autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
The office has 181 employees and a budget of $10 million. Given his 
department's increased workload, Kornblum won an extra $729,000 this year from 
the supervisors. "We've got too many cases to handle. We need more staff," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Too Worried 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, 55, told The Times he was "not really too worried" about the current 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Noguchi got into hot water was his penchant for taking on consulting 
work and ordering his employees to help him conduct private research. His 
critics complained that it interfered with the coroner's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Kornblum disclosed in court testimony that he had asked his 
niece, who works in a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department laboratory, to 
test a suspected murder weapon for blood. At the time, Kornblum was testifying 
as a $150-an-hour consultant in an Orange County murder case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true," Kornblum told a reporter. "It was not a very wise thing to do. I 
thought it was the quickest way to resolve the case." He added that he does 
consulting work "two or three times a year." 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum said his niece did the work on her own time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hired by Noguchi 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of UC San Francisco Medical School, the former Ventura County 
coroner was hired by Noguchi as his chief of forensic medicine in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum believes that much of the current controversy about the department 
stems from his hiring last March of Karl Harris, who has both an extensive 
educational background, including a doctorate in psychology, and law 
enforcement experience as chief of the police force that protects the campuses 
of Los Angeles' community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum made Harris, 57, his assistant chief of investigations and then, 
almost immediately, gave him a green light to form a special internal 
investigative unit amid reports of internal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Fraud 
</P>
<P>
It was not long before Harris' sleuthing crew presented Kornblum with a 
potential fraud case involving the burial of indigent veterans. Harris 
uncovered evidence that some mortuaries, with the help of coroner's employees, 
were billing the county and the Veterans Administration for the cremation and 
mortuary expenses of poor veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Under the alleged scam, a mortuary would first collect approximately $400 per 
body from the county for burial costs. Then, with authorization from a contact 
inside the coroner's office, the mortuary would also put in for burial benefits 
to the Veterans Administration -- without reimbursing the county. 
</P>
<P>
In this way, a dishonest mortuary could pick up as much as $1,400 per body, 
said one former coroner's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Both the county auditor and the district attorney's office are investigating 
the allegations. Assisting them is the investigative arm of the Veterans 
Administration and the U.S. Secret Service, according to an informed source. 
</P>
<P>
With Kornblum's blessing, Harris' unit met more than a year ago with the county 
chief administrative officer's head of special investigations, Harry Koulos, on 
the alleged veterans scam. Koulos relayed the information to the county auditor 
and the district attorney. Officials do not know how many bodies might have 
been involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phony Identification Cards 
</P>
<P>
Harris' crew also found that drivers for the defunct trucking firm, Central 
Transportation of Sunland, were using phony county identification cards when 
they picked up bodies at homes and hospitals. Officials of the firm, hired 
without a contract to reduce some of the coroner's drivers' workload, said they 
had the cards printed to cut the red tape involved in taking possession of 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Firm officials said they had authorization to have the cards printed from a 
coroner's official, Gary Siglar, who had not obtained county identification 
cards for Central Transportation's drivers. Siglar denied giving such 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, authorities are investigating whether any of Central 
Transportation's drivers, some of whom have felony records, had anything to do 
with burglaries at the homes where they had picked up bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Between May, 1988, and last February, continuing internal investigations turned 
up about 80 problems, ranging from alleged criminal wrongdoing to shoddy work, 
a knowledgeable source told The Times. The individual, a key source for 
government investigators, asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and Kornblum, meanwhile, had a falling out and Harris left at the end of 
1988. "Kornblum had an opportunity to clean house and make it a squeaky-clean 
department," said Harris, who believes he was forced out for doing his job too 
well. "He just dropped the ball because he fears publicity. He just covered it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Probably a Mistake' 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, however, said Harris ran amok. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, hiring (Harris) was probably a mistake," Kornblum said. 
"Unfortunately, he took a bad situation and made it worse. . . . It was my own 
fault for allowing it to happen. (Harris' internal investigative group) became 
their own little private Gestapo." 
</P>
<P>
A final determination of any wrongdoing on the part of any coroner's employee 
may be months away. 
</P>
<P>
J. Tyler McCauley, the veteran chief of the county's audit division, is 
coordinating the audit. The county staff work is being augmented by the Harvey 
M. Rose Accountancy Corp., which is preparing a $180,000 management study due 
by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, a former California auditor-general, and his San Francisco-based firm 
have a long track record. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done work for 28 grand juries in 16 counties since 1982," Rose said. "My 
staff lives, eats and breathes government operations." 
</P>
<P>
Three outside experts are working with Rose's staff: 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. Richard Mason, forensic pathologist for the Santa Cruz County 
sheriff-coroner, will study the efficiency of the coroner's doctors. 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. Randall C. Baselt, director of the Chemical Toxicology Institute of 
Foster City, will analyze the coroner's lab work. 
</P>
<P>
* Wesley Johnson, a retired Santa Clara County assistant sheriff, will evaluate 
the coroner's investigations.

OFFICERS' CONDUCT AFTER GIRL'S SHOOTING PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials are looking into citizen complaints that officers 
failed to promptly pursue the getaway vehicle in a drive-by shooting and 
allowed a mortally wounded 7-year-old victim to go too long without medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the Aug. 2 attack at the Imperial Courts housing project contend 
that two officers who arrived within seconds of the shooting waited at least 
five minutes before chasing the getaway vehicle. Residents of the Watts housing 
project also said that when they complained about the delay, police attacked 
them with batons, one man was arrested and another man's arm was broken. 
</P>
<P>
Several tenants also alleged that the drive-by shooting victim, Kanita Haley, 
who was wounded in the head during a hail of automatic gunfire, lay in a yard 
for as long as 20 minutes before she was taken to a hospital. The Grape 
Elementary School student died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are looking into the tenants' allegations, first made to 
reporters last week. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. M. M. Wasson, commander of the Southeast Division, said Thursday that a 
preliminary inquiry has turned up no wrongdoing by the first two officers who 
arrived at the shooting scene near 115th Street and Mona Boulevard. Other 
officers took crowd-control actions, he said, only after someone in the crowd 
threw a bottle at them. 
</P>
<P>
Wasson said, however, that new information provided at a meeting of the tenants 
Wednesday must be checked out before a final determination is made. "This may 
end up as a personnel complaint and that would put it into a whole different 
independent investigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Fire Department spokesman, Battalion Chief Ed Allen, said the ambulance crew 
reported that they arrived at the scene nine minutes after a call from police 
and took Kanita to the hospital six minutes later -- a total of 15 minutes 
after the original call. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the department's response-time goal is five minutes, but he added, 
"We delivered her to the hospital in a reasonable amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
A computer record, which Allen disputes, indicated that the ambulance might 
have stayed at the scene for as long as 43 minutes. He said he believes that 
the ambulance crew neglected to sign off the computer after completing the run. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who attended a meeting of the 
Imperial Courts Residents Council on Wednesday, said she will help the man 
whose arm was broken file a formal complaint with police. 
</P>
<P>
Wasson said the meeting was the first time he had heard that someone may have 
been injured by police after the child's shooting. The man with the broken arm, 
who declined to give his name because he feared police retaliation, told Wasson 
that he will cooperate with police in their inquiry. On Thursday, police said, 
the man declined to be interviewed by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a cast on his left arm, he told his story to an audience of about 60 
people at the tenants meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the shooting, the man said, he was walking through a grassy 
area near 115th Street and Mona Boulevard when he heard gunfire and people 
shouting that a child had been shot. Almost simultaneously, he said, he saw a 
police car pull into view just as the car carrying the gunman sped into an 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
The man said he ran to the police car and reported the shooting. Other tenants 
also ran up to the police car, he said, and pointed in the direction of the 
speeding getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of pursuing the car, the man complained, the officer who was driving 
pulled to the curb and parked. It was a full five minutes, he said, before 
police drove away, apparently in pursuit of the getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
By the time other officers arrived, the man said, an increasingly angry crowd 
had gathered. When people in the crowd demanded to know why the first officers 
had delayed, he said, police began pushing them back and hitting some people 
with batons. 
</P>
<P>
He could not get out of the way fast enough, he said, and was struck on both 
arms and in the ribs by an officer. He and other tenants denied that anyone 
threw a bottle at police. 
</P>
<P>
Another man was arrested for inciting the crowd, according to a police 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Wasson said after the meeting Wednesday that the two officers arrived at the 
scene between 10 seconds and 15 seconds after the shooting. He said they had 
not immediately chased the suspected getaway car because they had not seen it 
and had not determined the origin of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, according to Wasson, might have spent as long as two minutes 
trying to summon emergency aid on their car radios. Another two to three 
minutes, he said, were spent trying to figure out exactly what was happening.

COPTERS ATTACK MEDFLIES IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agricultural officials launched an airborne assault on the Mediterranean fruit 
fly late Thursday night as two helicopters began spraying the pesticide 
malathion on a 14-square-mile area northwest of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
County inspectors announced earlier that they had found 34 additional Medflies 
and 28 pieces of fruit riddled with the insect's larvae in an Elysian Park 
neighborhood that officials said is the epicenter of an infestation by the 
crop-destroying pest. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy said inspectors late 
Wednesday found the latest Medflies and larvae in traps in the 1600 block of 
Sargent Place, less than a mile west of Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We've identified the area as the epicenter of the infestation," Spaugy said. 
"I hope it's the only epicenter we find." 
</P>
<P>
County entomologists on Thursday confirmed that at least one of the female 
Medflies trapped in a peach tree on Sargent Place was preparing to lay eggs, 
Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
"That shows clearly that we have a breeding population," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials on Wednesday announced the first discovery of Medfly larvae, the 
white maggots that later grow into adult flies, in a single peach taken from a 
tree also in the 1600 block of Sargent Place. 
</P>
<P>
County inspectors for the last two weeks have been checking daily the more than 
1,600 fly traps put in the area after the discovery of the first Medfly in an 
Echo Park neighborhood July 20. The traps used by the county release scents 
that, to the male Medfly, "smell like a single's bar," inspector Raymond Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
County and state officials earlier this week persuaded Gov. George Deukmejian 
to declare a state of emergency after inspectors found a third adult Medfly in 
a lemon tree Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's declaration cleared the way for the aerial spraying of malathion 
over the communities of Elysian Park, Echo Park and Silver Lake, where an 
estimated 85,000 to 100,000 people live. The spray area is roughly bounded by 
3rd Street on the south, Los Feliz Boulevard and the Golden State Freeway on 
the north, Western Avenue on the west and the Harbor and Pasadena freeways and 
San Fernando Road on the east. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials said that the spray, which is a mixture of malathion in 
a corn syrup base, is in a dosage that is not harmful to humans or animals. 
However, they urged residents to stay indoors during the spraying. The biggest 
potential damage is to the paint on uncovered automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocate Ted Hayes said that the governor's office turned down his 
request Thursday to delay the aerial spraying until state and county agencies 
could provide overnight shelter for thousands of area homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"They are warning residents to stay inside, but homeless people have no place 
to go inside," Hayes said. "They're going to be outside, laying on their backs 
asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying is the first step in what officials estimate will be a 
$1-million fight to eliminate the Medfly from the area. Officials on Aug. 21 
plan to begin releasing 40 million sterile Medflies a week over a 
50-square-mile area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEDICAL BUILDING HIT BY BOMB BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A medical building housing the office of a white supremacist organization in 
Glendale was hit early Thursday by a bomb explosion that shattered windows and 
caused about $5,000 damage, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reported injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story structure in the 1200 block of South Glendale Avenue was shaken 
by the blast of a medium-strength bomb at 3:30 a.m., according to Capt. John 
Orr of the Glendale Fire Department's arson-explosive unit. 
</P>
<P>
Orr said that George King, a member of the League of Pace Amendment Advocates, 
favoring deportation of all people who are not white Christians, told 
authorities that he believes the bomb was directed at his organization. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been turned over to the FBI because it may have been politically 
motivated, Orr said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY PICKS COMRIE FOR METRO RAIL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday appointed City Administrative Officer 
Keith Comrie to represent the city on a three-member cost-cutting panel to 
oversee the beleagured Metro Rail project. 
</P>
<P>
The board will monitor construction on the first 4 miles of the subway, which a 
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission audit found to be $135 million, or 
10%, over budget. The overrun triggered a clause in the funding contract 
between the transportation commission, the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District and the city that establishes a committee with authority to direct 
economy measures on the project, which is two years behind. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum or his alternate, political consultant Mike Lewis, 
represents the LACTC. The SCRTD has not yet appointed its representative. The 
board's first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 17.

PRIVATE FUND OFFERED TO FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apartment owners along a notoriously crime-ridden street in Panorama City took 
the unprecedented step Thursday of offering private money to increase police 
patrols in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The offer met with enthusiasm from a Los Angeles City Council member, but drew 
a warning from a police executive that it could lead to wealthier neighborhoods 
buying more security at the cost of less protection in poorer areas. 
</P>
<P>
Five owners pledged $1,000 apiece and told city officials they believe that 
another 30 apartment owners along a half-mile stretch of Blythe Street between 
Van Nuys Boulevard and Brimfield Avenue are willing to pay to get drug dealers 
and gangs off the street. 
</P>
<P>
The street has been plagued for years by drug dealers, who frequently rent 
local apartments and sell their wares from the curb, a stubborn problem that 
has returned after a two-year special police campaign to crush the trade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Set a Precedent 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the City Council, the donation would mark the first time in Los 
Angeles history that private money would be used to increase patrols, said 
Cmdr. William Booth of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The department has previously accepted donations of office space, equipment and 
clerical and interpretation services for police substations from merchants in 
such areas as Koreatown and Baldwin Hills, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor M. Meyerstein, who owns an apartment house in the area and suggested 
contributing the money, called Blythe Street "an isolated desert in an 
otherwise prosperous area." 
</P>
<P>
"If we really want to get rid of the drug dealers, we have to put our money 
where our mouths are and pay for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Panorama City apartment owners manage to raise their goal of $35,000, 
the money would provide two uniformed officers to patrol the neighborhood eight 
hours a day on overtime pay for about two-and-half months, said Lt. Ron Seban 
of the LAPD's Valley Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bernardi Supports Idea 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi said he strongly supports the effort, which 
apartment owners discussed Thursday at a meeting called by Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
The money would have to be donated to the city treasury, and then appropriated 
for police pay, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try in every way I can to get this money through the council to the 
police," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a prison on Blythe Street right now, and your guards are the drug 
dealers. A lot has been done to clean up the area already, but we had to cut 
back when the money ran out." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a special narcotics task force, composed of 13 uniformed 
officers borrowed from police divisions throughout the Valley, which combed the 
area for drug dealers from July, 1987, until May of this year.

CITY COLLEGE PRESIDENT QUITS AMID CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a push from her bosses, Stelle Feuers has resigned the presidency of Los 
Angeles City College, a post she held for 11 years, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Her departure reflects dissatisfaction with the way she has run the oldest and 
most ethnically diverse of Los Angeles' nine community colleges, high-ranking 
administration sources said. It also represents another of many major personnel 
changes made since Donald G. Phelps became district chancellor last year. 
</P>
<P>
Feuers' resignation is effective Sept. 15 when she will become an assistant to 
Phelps for fund raising and legislative matters. Edwin Young, a vice president 
at Los Angeles Valley College, will serve as interim president at City College 
while the district conducts a national search for Feuers' permanent successor, 
Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
City College, located on North Vermont Avenue in east Hollywood, was founded 60 
years ago at what had been the first campus for UCLA. The college once was a 
jewel of the education system in Los Angeles, but critics charge that it is now 
academically adrift, physically run down and unable to keep up with ethnic 
changes in its student body. 
</P>
<P>
Feuers denied that she was forced out. She said she had planned to resign this 
summer if another position became available. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here a long time, and I think it's time for new leadership on the 
campus," she said, stressing that few college presidents last more than five 
years in their jobs nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
She has been with the district for 24 years, starting as an assistant 
psychology professor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trustees' Support 
</P>
<P>
However, several sources close to Phelps said he wanted the resignation for 
some time and won support for that from the district's Board of Trustees. 
Politically, Feuers was seen by some as a holdover from the administration of 
Leslie Koltai, Phelps' predecessor who was forced out of office two years ago 
after much conflict with the teachers union. Recent elections have created a 
solid pro-union majority on the Trustees Board. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Phelps praised Feuers and said that the two of them 
agreed it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"She provided leadership through some difficult times economically, and the 
campus has known a lot of success under Stelle Feuers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "When things go well, we can enjoy them. When things don't 
go well, we are the ones who have to be held accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Even Feuers' critics concede that many problems at City College were caused by 
the age of the school's buildings, the district's severe financial crisis three 
years ago and a reluctance by some students to venture into Hollywood. 
Reflecting a districtwide trend, the school's enrollment dropped from 20,000 
seven years ago to about 13,000 four years ago but is up to 15,000 now. 
</P>
<P>
But even when Koltai was still chancellor, the faculty Senate in 1984 approved 
a vote of no confidence in Feuers, saying she had not done enough to prevent a 
decline at City College. She was temporarily reassigned to district 
headquarters but returned the following year. 
</P>
<P>
"Her tenure there has been less than inspirational. The college has kind of 
been like a ship without a rudder," said Henry Ealy, a professor of history and 
Afro-American studies there for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, her supporters said t she is a scapegoat of the teachers 
union and that her survival in the job for 11 years proves her skills. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Feuers said that a lot of her actions were not 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have our jobs to do. It is very difficult after a long period of time 
to make decisions that everybody will like," she said, adding that she leaves 
"with neither animosity nor misgivings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Mixture 
</P>
<P>
According to district statistics, City College's student body is 31% Latino, 
27% Asian, 20% Anglo and 19% black, with the rest a mixture of Middle 
Easterners and other recent immigrants. It offers many courses in English as a 
second language and classes for immigrants trying to obtain legal residency 
under the amnesty law. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking across the campus is like a walk across the United Nations," Phelps 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to offer more services to help the different ethnic groups and 
to see many more City College students transfer to four-year universities to 
earn bachelor's degrees. He also said campus buildings need many repairs and a 
new gymnasium and library should be built if state funds are available. 
</P>
<P>
Since Phelps arrived a year ago from a similar post in Seattle, the Los Angeles 
Community College District has seen a string of shake-ups. There are new 
presidents at East Los Angeles and Pierce colleges. The presidents of Harbor 
and Trade-Tech colleges have been promoted to positions as districtwide acting 
vice chancellors, with acting presidents leading those campuses now. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said Feuers' departure was fairly amicable, especially 
compared to the forced retirement of Arthur Avila as president of East Los 
Angeles College last year. Avila claimed emotional distress and got a $35,000 
settlement, as well as pay for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
One district trustee said Feuers did not resist at all when Phelps talked to 
her recently about resigning and becoming his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"No sooner out of Don's mouth than she said 'great,' " the trustee recounted.

NEWSWIRE: SOUTH CAROLINA COACHES SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three former University of South Carolina football coaches and a Maryland man, 
convicted on the testimony of players, drew relatively light sentences Thursday 
for distributing steroids to their athletes in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge G. Ross Anderson sentenced the four to one-year terms in a 
halfway house, then suspended six months to nine months of each sentence and 
placed all four on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Former coach Tom Kurucz, who pleaded guilty June 1 to one misdemeanor count of 
dispensing steroids to players and a felony count of lying to a grand jury, 
received the harshest sentence -- six months. It was the minimum term allowed 
under federal sentencing guidelines. Kurucz had faced a maximum of six years in 
prison and $350,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry and ashamed," Kurucz told Anderson before he was sentenced. "I now 
have a new job and I request you let me continue to make a living for my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Washburn and Keith Kephart, two other former coaches convicted along with 
John L. Carter of Bethesda, Md., on lesser charges, were each sentenced to 
three months.

STORMS POUND OWENS VALLEY FOR THIRD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Powerful thunderstorms battered the Owens Valley for the third straight day 
Thursday, undermining the Los Angeles Aqueduct -- already buried under more 
than 100,000 cubic yards of flash-flood debris -- cutting U.S. 395 and flooding 
a town in Mono County. 
</P>
<P>
The downpours were spawned by a massive subtropical weather system that has 
been lashing the deserts of California, Arizona and Nevada since Tuesday with 
torrential, wind-whipped rains. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the rains are expected to continue today, especially in 
Imperial and Riverside counties, bringing the threat of additional flooding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communities Flooded 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the storms flooded riverfront residential and 
business communities in the Yuma, Ariz., area, generated gusts of close to 100 
m.p.h. that caused about $14 million in damage in Las Vegas and buried a 
two-mile stretch of the Los Angeles Aqueduct -- which provides 75% of Los 
Angeles' water -- under an avalanche of sand, mud and rock. 
</P>
<P>
At noon Thursday, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power crews had to 
abandon their aqueduct cleanup efforts near Olancha as a vast mass of 
thunderclouds stalled over the area, dumping rain along a 120-mile stretch of 
the eastern High Sierra. The cloudbursts continued unabated throughout the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The downpours triggered new flash floods that raced through the small community 
of Chalfant Valley, about 15 miles north of Bishop on California 6. The 
floodwaters invaded at least 29 homes, forcing evacuation of most of the town's 
residents. California 6 and California 120 remained closed by water and debris 
for the second day. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 miles to the south, cloudbursts driven by 60 m.p.h. winds gouged out 
the underpinnings of the aqueduct near Cartago and cut U.S. 395 for the second 
time in three days, closing a 63-mile stretch of the road between Lone Pine and 
the junction of California 14, near Inyokern. U.S. 395 is the principal route 
between Southern California and the eastern Sierra resort areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Inyo County sheriff's office said its officers were evacuating motorists 
who were stranded by the floodwaters, and additional officers were standing by 
in case the towns of Olancha and Cartago -- about five miles apart on U.S. 395, 
on the shores of usually dry Owens Lake -- began to flood. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy sheriff burst in the door of the Hitching Post cafe in Olancha about 
4:30 p.m. and warned the patrons to get moving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Aqueduct Could Break' 
</P>
<P>
"The aqueduct could break and a wall of water could come down right here," he 
said. "Get in your cars and head south." 
</P>
<P>
The rains stopped, at least temporarily, about 5 p.m. Portions of U.S. 395 were 
reopened and Department of Water and Power crews moved back in to survey the 
new damage to the aqueduct. However, the National Weather Service said 
additional thunderstorms were expected to hit the area during the night. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hampton, who has lived in Olancha 17 years, said she came into town 
Thursday afternoon to buy gas "and found a river flowing down the highway. I 
just about got swept away. I was lucky to get out of here. I've never seen 
anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
At Vicky's Mobil station at the south end of town, Bob Smith, 15, said he spent 
the day helping a neighbor shovel mud piled up around her home and helped 
evacuate her 10 horses. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time the sheriff told us we might have to get out of here," said Mary 
Lou Smith, Bob's mother. "Up there by (California) 190 it was knee deep and 
moving real fast." 
</P>
<P>
The flooding had a silver lining for the service station where the Smiths work: 
"The store was super, super busy," Mary Lou Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
People whose cars were lined up on the highway "came in to buy goodies while 
they were waiting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the aqueduct cleanup is expected to take another two weeks or more, 
the DWP said Los Angeles will continue to receive an adequate supply of water 
from down-channel reservoirs and through purchases from the Metropolitan Water 
District, which draws on other sources. None of the DWP's major 
power-generating facilities were shut down by the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
In Yuma, Mayor Jim Buster said Thursday that 500 to 1,000 homes had been 
damaged by floodwaters that raced through the Colorado River community during a 
three-hour downpour that dropped 4.8 inches of rain -- almost twice the normal 
annual total -- late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got several main roads closed, water pipes busted, you name it," he 
said. "The south side of town has no water pressure in case of a fire. . . . 
The storm drains are maxed out. There's no place to pump the water." 
</P>
<P>
Buster said that with floodwaters as deep as four feet in some residential 
areas, "some of the people had to swim out." 
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of the storm was so great that we could not get our people in to 
evacuate people," said Roger Gingrich, Yuma's assistant director of public 
services. "I ended up almost flipping my four-wheel-drive vehicle and having to 
abandon it on my way to help a pregnant lady. They were finally able to get to 
her with fire apparatus." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie O'Neill, a Yuma resident, said thrill seekers in four-wheel-drive 
vehicles caused some hard feelings at the height of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened was that a lot of idiots went wheeling up and down the streets . 
. . and caused waves that got into people's homes," O'Neill said. "Well, the 
homeowners didn't like that and they were out there with baseball bats hitting 
windshields before the police arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Buster said officers were ticketing four-wheelers who were causing the 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
With floodwaters still standing in some low-lying areas Thursday night, a 
number of residents were being housed at local schools and a National Guard 
armory. 
</P>
<P>
Across the river, in the Imperial County community of Winterhaven, residents 
said water was still standing "neck deep" in some areas Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
In Indio, hit by flash-flooding Wednesday night, one of the westbound lanes of 
Interstate 10 remained closed by debris Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said a Riverside County sheriff's deputy and a California Highway 
Patrol officer waded into a flooded wash near Indio on Wednesday night to pull 
two girls to safety after their car overturned while fording the stream.

HISTORY'S BIGGEST FIRE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its assets include a racehorse with syphilis, the world's first vertical 
country club and the shell of a luxury condominium on a rocky ledge in Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Resolution Trust Corp., which conducted its first business on 
Thursday, will be the largest financial institution in the world. 
</P>
<P>
To the RTC falls the distasteful task of being garbage man of the 
savings-and-loan crisis, the agency that must clean up the littered streets 
after an orgy of mismanagement, miscalculation, greed and outright theft. 
</P>
<P>
The newest federal agency opened for business with a bulging portfolio of $104 
billion worth of assets from the 262 failing S&amp;Ls that federal regulators 
have seized since February. In the next two or three years, the RTC is expected 
to close several hundred more S&amp;Ls and accumulate assets nominally worth as 
much as $400 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Healthy Portfolios 
</P>
<P>
The RTC will sell the healthy portions of the savings institutions it takes 
over, such as portfolios of home loans. 
</P>
<P>
That should be easy. The far trickier job will be disposing of the undesirable 
real estate and problematic business ventures -- the churches built on 
speculation, the shopping centers 10 miles from the nearest homes, the sperm 
bank for buffalo. As much as $150 billion of the RTC's $400 billion in assets 
is likely to be in this category. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not having a thrift crisis. What we're having is a real estate crisis," 
said Jamie J. Jackson, president of Oak Tree Capital, a merchant banking firm 
active in S&amp;L rescues. "The RTC will become the largest real estate owner 
and manager in the history of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the agency will function as a property "undertaker, handling 
bodies all over the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The more the RTC makes, the better for the taxpayers, because money from the 
sale of the assets will help pay the cost of making good on federal deposit 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6 Distressed States 
</P>
<P>
The new law lists six economically distressed states -- Texas, Oklahoma, 
Colorado, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico -- where the RTC cannot sell a 
property for less than 95% of market value. That may be a difficult goal to 
reach, but Congress feared that excessive bargains would depress 
already-lackluster markets. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do too much too fast, they glut the market," said Mark J. Riedy, 
president of the National Council of Savings Institutions. "If they do too 
little too late, it raises the cost to taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
This biggest going-out-of-business sale in history is drawing swarms of eager 
players. In Washington on Tuesday, a day before the RTC was born, more than 300 
deal makers, accountants, lawyers, auctioneers, bankers and S&amp;L executives 
jammed into a standing-room-only conference on the new agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise up here is almost deafening," Riedy joked at the speaker's rostrum. 
"From the podium, I can hear your meters ticking." 
</P>
<P>
A worried Rep. Elizabeth (Liz) J. Patterson (D-S.C.) said recently: "There are 
people out there waiting to pick the Resolution Trust Corp.'s pocket before it 
has its pants on." 
</P>
<P>
The potential "for scandal is tremendous," said Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
Guarding against scandal and setting RTC policies will be the responsibility of 
an oversight board composed of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Federal 
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development Jack Kemp and two private citizens to be named by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
On a daily operating basis, the RTC will be directed by L. William Seidman, 
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates banks and 
guarantees their deposits up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, which will supply all personnel for the RTC, expects to hire several 
thousand new workers to keep track of the huge volume of real estate and other 
assets that must be sold. Beyond that, the RTC will hire a small army of 
subcontractors as property managers, disposal experts, sales agents and 
auctioneers. 
</P>
<P>
The new S&amp;L legislation orders the RTC to publish an inventory of all its 
properties by January, a virtually impossible task. A few of the more bizarre 
investments, such as the syphillitic horse, are widely known in the financial 
community, although there are few details. But for the most part, the bankrupt 
institutions being seized by the government are precisely the ones that have 
been mismanaged by executives who kept sloppy records or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a lot more than four months to get your hands around the 
inventory," said John A. Koskinen, chief executive of the Palmieri Co. in 
Washington, which specializes in managing troubled companies. When his firm 
worked on the Penn Central Railroad bankruptcy, he said, it took a full year 
simply to locate the records for all of the 8,500 properties owned by the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Koskinen's firm has encountered similar chaotic record-keeping while running 
S&amp;Ls as a conservator on behalf of the government. For example, there were 
scanty files on real estate loans with no information on how much money was 
advanced, how much had been repaid or what had been offered as collateral. Some 
loans for motels did not show the correct number of rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Making it even harder to get a correct inventory is a severe shortage of 
professionals to appraise and help sell properties. 
</P>
<P>
Appraisers in Texas, the heartland of failed thrifts and repossessed real 
estate, are in desperately short supply, said G. Ronald Witten, president of 
the Dallas real estate research firm M/PF Research. The backlog of work already 
stretches for two months and more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unraveling the ownership of seized real estate could take years. Many 
properties were held as joint ventures by various investors and had numerous 
lenders. Title questions on some properties may take five years or more to 
resolve, according to real estate experts familiar with properties the RTC will 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Those disputes will likely end up in court. Some real estate consultants 
predict that as many as 100,000 civil lawsuits -- 15,000 more than were filed 
in Los Angeles County last year for all purposes -- will swamp the RTC as 
lenders and investors fight for the scraps of assets. 
</P>
<P>
A shrewd eye and sound judgment will be needed to find the salvageable 
properties -- the empty office buildings that can be rented with a bit of 
renovation, the tracts of homes that can be completed and sold at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC will first try to sell seized S&amp;Ls whole to healthy thrifts and 
banks seeking to expand their branch networks and deposits. But when the 
portfolios of bad real estate are too big, the RTC will have to strip out the 
losing assets before making a deal to sell an S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not Wilshire Boulevard property, it's primarily junk," said Joseph E. 
Robert, chairman and chief executive of J. E. Robert Cos., an Alexandria, Va., 
firm that manages troubled loans and assets for government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
William L. Callender, chief executive of California Federal Bank in Los 
Angeles, has reviewed the portfolios of troubled thrifts, looking at assets 
that he says are so bad they cannot be given away. The properties include 
time-share vacation condominiums in Louisiana that look out over oil rigs and 
apartment buildings with three-quarters of their units vacant. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the case of the vertical "country club." It's a club in a 
high-rise building chock-full of recreational facilities but unfortunately 
lacking a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the assets are "totally unsellable at virtually any price," Callender 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the RTC's mission under the law is to dispose of the properties 
</P>
<P>
by Dec. 31, 1996, when it is scheduled to go out of business. The logistics of 
disposing of such a huge portfolio are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sold $10 million of real estate each day seven days a week for 365 days 
a year, it would take 28 years just to sell $100 billion, and that's without a 
day off," said James Gall, president of the Auction Co. of America, a 
Miami-based firm used by the FDIC to sell assets from seized banks. 
</P>
<P>
Gall hopes to snare a chunk of business from the RTC and the property managers 
it hires. Arguing that auctions can help move an otherwise stagnant market, he 
notes that his firm recently sold for $2.7 million a San Francisco condominium 
that had stood empty for two years at a $3.1-million asking price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knows It's a Hard Sell 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Butler knows from experience how hard it is to sell the holdings of 
defunct S&amp;Ls. He handled the disposition of the bad assets of 
Stockton-based American Savings &amp; Loan, which was seized by federal 
regulators and sold to a private investor, Robert M. Bass of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a major effort, Butler told a seminar in June: "We still have under 
property management 1,700 condos, 540 single-family detached units, 8,000 
apartment units, 2,500 acres of land, 13 hotels/motels with 2,400 rooms, 1.725 
million square feet of retail space, 3.19 million of office space, a 
kitty-litter mine, one marina with boat slips, the nation's largest indoor flea 
market, one winery and one truck stop -- and a few other little parcels." 
</P>
<P>
Even if all of RTC's assets were good, who has the money to buy them? 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors have spent huge amounts of money in recent years buying 
choice U.S. real estate. Yet the Japanese own only $43 billion worth of such 
property, compared with the $150 billion in undesirable properties the RTC may 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Some markets, especially in depressed Texas and Oklahoma, are already burdened 
with real estate seized by S&amp;Ls when loans went bad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$3 Billion in California 
</P>
<P>
As of March, U.S. thrifts owned about $31 billion in real estate that they had 
taken back from buyers. About $3 billion of it was in California, second only 
to the $16 billion worth of properties in Texas. Despite the comparatively big 
holdings in California, experts expect little or no impact on the state's 
healthy and diversified real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a huge addition to the ranks of foreclosed properties as the RTC 
proceeds, "we wouldn't even notice it," said Stan Ross, co-managing partner 
with Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a Los Angeles-based accounting firm 
specializing in national real estate.

CHINA PROTESTER'S FLIGHT TO FREEDOM GROUNDED IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old Chinese woman who says she fled Beijing after taking part in the 
student protest for democracy in Tian An Men Square has spent the last six 
weeks in custody at a federal detention center in Inglewood -- an unexpected 
last hurdle on what she describes as a flight for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
So far, almost all of what Chen Yiwei has seen of the United States has been 
framed by the bars of the federal facility, an imposition that does not seem to 
have dampened her enthusiasm for the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that America is a good country," Chen said. "I'll have a future here." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's bid for political asylum is to be heard today. Her cause has become a 
rallying point for Southern California Chinese, some of whom have visited her 
regularly to console her and buck up her spirits. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials refused to discuss her 
case. A recommendation for how the INS should rule on Chen's status has been 
prepared by the State Department for the hearing today before an immigration 
judge in Los Angeles. Her attorney is optimistic that authorities will believe 
her story and grant her political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Chen is one of about 20 Chinese in the region who have applied for political 
asylum, according to the INS, but she is believed to be the only woman among 
six Chinese nationals being detained in Los Angeles. She was taken into custody 
at Los Angeles International Airport when authorities discovered that her 
passport was forged -- a necessity, she says, for her escape. 
</P>
<P>
A student from the southern Chinese city of Xiamen, Chen said she was among 
about 70 youths who journeyed by train from her hometown to Beijing in late May 
to join pro-democracy students at Tian An Men Square. At first, her older 
brother had discouraged her from going, but Chen was determined to be part of 
the movement. 
</P>
<P>
That decision later landed her on a government wanted list after the night of 
June 3, when soldiers and protesters clashed in a bloody encounter. Now, more 
than two months later, as public attention has shifted to other events, Chen's 
future -- and the future of other protesters-turned-fugitives -- remains 
touched by that fateful night. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced after her brother's capture that there was no place in China where 
she could elude authorities, Chen managed to flee the country by way of Hong 
Kong and Tokyo with help from friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
She declined to provide details of that journey to protect those who helped 
her. Upon her arrival at Los Angeles International Airport on June 24, U.S. 
Customs officials, detecting her forged passport, shuttled her off in handcuffs 
to the detention center on Century Boulevard near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Distraught, drained and unable to eat or sleep much, Chen said her first days 
in the detention center were the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"The 10 days were like a year," she said. "I stood at the window looking 
outside." At night she cried. "An old lady on the bottom bunk scolded me, but I 
couldn't help it." 
</P>
<P>
Often, she stared out the window, catching glimpses of an America she once knew 
only through photographs. She watched as shiny cars whizzed past and 
pedestrians in flashy clothes sauntered by. Amid the blur of color and motion, 
what caught her attention most were the mothers holding children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"How lucky they are, they are with their relatives," Chen said tearfully in a 
recent interview. "I'm here alone. I don't know if I will ever see my parents 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The two-story Inglewood facility holds 100 people and is the only detention 
center in the Los Angeles immigration district, said John Looney, a deputy 
district director of immigration in Los Angeles. The district covers counties 
from Ventura to Los Angeles to San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Security is tight at the center, a putty-colored building that was converted 
from a motel. Flanking the center are an abandoned, boarded-up liquor store and 
a string of inexpensive motels. 
</P>
<P>
The front windows are sealed with opaque, silver-colored material to prevent 
the curious from peeking in. Visitors must be buzzed in, and once inside they 
are escorted through a cell-like entry area before being directed to a small 
conference room. 
</P>
<P>
It is in the conference room, where detainees meet with their lawyers, that 
they enjoy some breathing space, Chen said. In the regular quarters, they are 
monitored closely by the staff and have little space to exercise. On their side 
of the courtyard, male detainees have a Ping-Pong table and a volleyball net. 
Space for women is more limited, and most just walk for exercise in their 
rooms, an adjoining walkway or in a small common area. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Chen had no contact with outsiders. With limited knowledge of 
English, Chen could not communicate with the other female detainees. 
</P>
<P>
Four Chinese men who also fled the Communist Party's crackdown on protesters 
were also detained at the center, but a faded red line painted on the concrete 
courtyard separated the men from the women. It was only at mealtimes that Chen 
caught a few encouraging words from her fellow Chinese detainees. 
</P>
<P>
"You must eat," they told her. "What has happened has happened. At least it's 
better here than in China. In China, you may be in jail or worse." 
</P>
<P>
She knew they were right, Chen said, but she could not forget the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever thought that the Chinese Liberation Army would shoot its own people?" 
Chen said, recalling the night she saw two friends crushed by an army tank and 
another fatally shot in the head. As she relived the painful experience, her 
forehead wrinkled into furrows. She spoke rapidly, her words flying in an 
emotional barrage. 
</P>
<P>
After the killings, Chen and her brother straggled back to their hometown, in 
shock and exhausted, only to find their names on a fugitives list published in 
the evening newspaper. Their pro-democracy activities were described as 
"counterrevolutionary." Chen believes that neighbors who had quarreled with her 
family had turned in their names. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't go home," she said her brother told her before they parted ways. 
"Promise me, no matter what happens, you have to escape, to the mountains, 
overseas. You must not come back here." Two days later, Chen heard from friends 
that her brother had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven days into her stay at the Inglewood detention center, two strangers came 
to see her. 
</P>
<P>
They were members of the Western American Assn. of Chinese Political Refugees, 
and they wanted to help and comfort her. They gave her Chinese-English 
dictionaries and newspapers, a tape recorder and English-language tapes. They 
learned of her predicament from Chen's immigration attorney, Dorothy Harper, 
who has helped other association members gain political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
"We told her not to worry," said George Mo, president of the political refugees 
association and a Catholic whose family had been persecuted in China for 
religious beliefs. "We told her there are many Chinese here who will help her. 
If her application is approved, we will help her find a job." 
</P>
<P>
Association volunteers take turns visiting Chen. Each detainee is allowed only 
one visit a week, on Wednesday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy I found my own people," Chen said. She has regained her 
appetite, to the point where she even eats raw salad vegetables, something 
uncommon in China. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy but at the same time I'm sad," she said. "Now I am applying for 
asylum, but in China people are still being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her mixed feelings, she is looking forward to a new life. 
</P>
<P>
"So many Chinese are helping me," Chen said. "I'm very moved."

POSTAL EMPLOYEE KILLS WIFE, 2 CO-WORKERS;

'MELLOW AND FRIENDLY' LETTER CARRIER LISTED AS BRAIN DEAD AFTER HE TURNS WEAPON

<P>
A 52-year-old career postal carrier described as a model employee as "mellow 
and friendly as could be" shot his wife to death Thursday morning and then 
drove about half a mile to work, where he shot and killed two co-workers and 
wounded a third before he shot himself in the head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified by police as John Merlin Taylor, was on life-support 
systems at Palomar Medical Center and described by authorities as "brain dead." 
The weapon for his rampage was a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol that police 
said he reloaded at least once as some co-workers ran for safety and others 
stood frozen in fear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Box of 100 Bullets 
</P>
<P>
Police said Taylor took a box of 100 bullets with him to the city's Orange Glen 
postal station, but apparently fired only 15 to 20 rounds before shooting 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Neither police nor postal employees could offer an explanation for the rampage. 
"We do not have a motive," said Escondido Police Chief Vincent Jimno. "We don't 
have anything to hang our hat on." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a model employee who was described as affable and mellow by those who 
had worked beside him, was dressed in his postal uniform when he showed up at 
7:35 a.m. But he was holding a handgun at his side. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have any emotion. He was stern faced," said co-worker William 
Karlson, one of about 10 employees inside the building when the shooting 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Taylor had shot his wife, Liz, according to Escondido police who found 
the woman's body in bed at the couple's home. The woman had been shot twice in 
the head, and police said they recovered two bullet casings that matched those 
at the Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor arrived at the Post Office, he approached co-workers Richard Berni, 
38, of San Marcos, and Ronald H. Williams, 56, of Escondido -- men who had 
probably assumed that Taylor, as was his habit, was getting to work early so he 
could join them on the loading dock picnic table for their morning coffee and a 
smoke before clocking in at 8 a.m. for his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
This time he shot them both to death, and then entered the side door of the 
building, shooting at some, not at others. He shot co-worker Paul DeRisi, 30, 
in the upper arm, reloaded, and sprayed still more bullets inside the building, 
but passed by others without harming them. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked back to check on someone and John Taylor walked through the side 
door," DeRisi said. "I said good morning and then I heard a pop. I noticed he 
had a gun in his hand and the second shot went through my (left) arm." 
</P>
<P>
DeRisi said he did not realize he had been shot until he felt the blood on his 
arm. "I took off for the front door and another bullet passed by me," he said. 
"I ran next door to a restaurant and told them to call the police. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I sat down outside and said to myself, 'Why John Taylor? Why is he doing 
this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Bob Henley, the postal station manager, said he had just finished talking with 
DeRisi about poster displays in the lobby, and when he looked out of the 
office, he saw DeRisi walking toward him, holding his bloodied shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Don't go out there! He's got a gun!' " Henley said. "I went out my 
door and he (Taylor) pointed the gun toward me. But he said, 'I'm not going to 
shoot you.' He shot away from me. I went back inside my office, closed the door 
and called 911." 
</P>
<P>
Custodian Reginald Keith said he mistook the sounds of gunfire for plastic mail 
trays hitting the floor, and turned around to see Taylor standing next to a 
drinking fountain. 
</P>
<P>
"A (ammunition) clip fell to the floor, and it looked like he dropped some ammo 
on the floor, too," Keith said. "He looked up and kind of looked at me, but he 
looked kind of dazed. Then he walked right by me -- about five feet away." 
</P>
<P>
Karlson said Taylor then walked past him as well, but did not threaten him. "He 
walked right by me toward the other end of the building. He didn't say a word. 
The gun was in his hand," Karlson said. "Right about then, someone yelled out, 
'Clear the building! This is for real!' Then Taylor raised the gun shoulder 
high, like you'd do at a target range, getting ready for your next shot." 
</P>
<P>
Karlson said he lost sight of Taylor. Seconds later, Taylor put the gun to his 
right temple. Taylor collapsed in a far corner of the building, spilling 
unspent ammunition from a box he had carried with him. 
</P>
<P>
The post office had opened to the public for business at 7 a.m. but apparently 
no customers were in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who escaped the shooting gathered outdoors and were met by co-workers 
still arriving for work; more than 60 workers would have been on duty at 8 
a.m., just 25 minutes after the shooting. Instead, they gathered in small 
groups. Some hugged, others cried. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Williams, wife of one of the victims, said she heard of the shooting 
from her daughter-in-law, who heard about it on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I waited to hear from him and I didn't," she said. "I tried to call the post 
office but I couldn't get through. Then I thought I'd better head over there 
and find out for myself. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got there, nobody would look at me or tell me anything and I began to 
get suspicious," she said. Authorities finally broke the news to her. "I'm just 
grateful," she said, "that they hadn't suffered." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said her husband looked to Taylor as a role model. "My husband always 
admired him. He didn't have anything against John. I don't think John had 
anything against him, either." 
</P>
<P>
Stunned co-workers described Taylor as an upbeat, cheerful and efficient 
employee and perhaps the most likeable of the employees at the small post 
office. 
</P>
<P>
While friends said Taylor -- a 27-year veteran of the U.S. Postal Service -- 
was not a complainer, he made a comment to co-workers Wednesday night 
indicating growing frustration with a job that he was within three years of 
retiring from. 
</P>
<P>
"Wednesday night, when he went home, he made some comment about how there's not 
enough mail here," said one co-worker who asked not to be identified. "But he 
was being sarcastic, because there was a ton of mail in there." 
</P>
<P>
"None of this figures," he said. "He knew those people -- he'd sit out with 
them each morning and chat with them. He could have shot me just as easily." 
</P>
<P>
Others dismissed any notion that Taylor had suffered burn-out on the job. "He 
never voiced a complaint," Karlson said. "The rest of us, we'd bitch, but this 
guy was too nice to bitch about anything." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Williams, who oversees Escondido's two post offices, said that Taylor was 
recently selected for a quarterly performance award -- but declined the honor 
and asked that it be given to someone else because he had won it several times 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
Said San Diego Postmaster Margaret Sellers, who arrived at the scene shortly 
after the shooting: "This is a model station, and he was a model employee." 
</P>
<P>
Postal authorities quickly sent three counselors to the scene and immediately 
began sessions with some of the traumatized workers. 
</P>
<P>
Co-worker Johnny Sims said that on Tuesday there was discussion among postal 
carriers -- including Taylor -- about the Aug. 20, 1986, incident in which 
Patrick Sherrill, a part-time letter carrier, walked into the Edmond, Okla., 
Post Office and shot and killed 14 co-workers before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking about something and got around to saying, 'What if something 
happened to one of the employees that would have gotten him mad and (caused 
him) to go berserk?' " Sims said. "We were just joking around. John was a 
happy-go-lucky guy always. You could never make him mad." 
</P>
<P>
Some fellow letter carriers said Taylor was grumbling recently that his 
22-year-old stepson was not working and had moved in with him and his wife. 
Indeed, there was concern for the whereabouts of the stepson, Liz Taylor's son 
by her first marriage. The young man apparently heard of the shooting on his 
car radio and drove to the scene, not sure whether his father was involved, 
said Police Lt. Earl Callander. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the Taylors were equally disbelieving Thursday morning as the 
commotion at the local post office spilled over into their quiet, older 
neighborhood and police cordoned off the couple's one-story, brown stucco home. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, police found a clean and well-kept house, Jimno said. No notes were 
found, nor any other weapons or ammunition -- although police were waiting for 
a formal search warrant before searching the house in detail. 
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of a struggle, Jimno said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Meyers, 16, who lives next door to the Taylors, said the couple seemed to 
have a happy marriage, punctuated by rare arguments. Said another neighbor, 
Barbara Pinto: 
</P>
<P>
"They were very friendly, a nice couple. They had a lot of friends. They went 
out dancing and they had people over. I don't know why this would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Pinto said Liz Taylor, who worked behind the jewelry counter at the Montgomery 
Ward Focus store in Escondido, "was the talker, and he (Taylor) was the 
listener. She could talk to anybody. I know they loved each other very much. He 
called her 'Poopsie.' "

INNER-CITY HOSPITALS FACE FINANCE CRISIS IN AIDS CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR F. ZONANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The AIDS epidemic is threatening to financially overwhelm inner-city hospitals, 
limiting their ability to treat other patients and raising the specter of 
health-care rationing, according to a study to be published today in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The study of 276 hospitals in 39 states was conducted by the National Public 
Health and Hospital Institute and represents the most comprehensive survey to 
date of the financial impact on hospitals of treating AIDS patients. No 
individual hospitals were cited in the study. 
</P>
<P>
The report paints AIDS as a disease of the poor and the medically 
disenfranchised, underscoring the contention of Dr. David Rogers, vice chairman 
of the National Commission on AIDS, that "AIDS is a one-way ticket to poverty." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the year on which the survey was based, 44% of AIDS patients admitted 
to hospitals were covered by Medicaid, 29% were covered by private medical 
insurance and 23% were indigent or uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
For hospitals, the impoverished patient population means low reimbursement 
rates from Medicaid or no payment at all from indigents who lack medical 
insurance. As a result, public hospitals, which treat poorer patients, lost 
$218 per AIDS patient per day on average, more than double the $92 a day loss 
sustained by private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The average daily per patient loss at public hospitals in the South was much 
higher -- $386 -- because of strict eligibility requirements for Medicaid 
there. In the West, public hospitals lost an average of $77 a day per AIDS 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
The situation for outpatient care for AIDS patients was even worse: Nationwide, 
public hospitals collect just 14 cents for every dollar's worth of such care 
that they provide, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
As the financial drain of AIDS grows, hard-hit hospitals may be forced to cut 
back on emergency-room services, trauma care, burn units, neonatal care and 
other critically needed services, warned the study's author, Dennis Andrulis. 
</P>
<P>
"Like it or not, AIDS is a communitywide problem and demands a communitywide 
solution," Andrulis said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Rationing is already taking place in many hospitals, Andrulis said, "but it is 
being done in subtle ways." He pointed to long waits for service in urban 
public hospitals and overwhelmed emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"God knows what the future will bring," he added. 
</P>
<P>
To head off the coming crisis, Andrulis proposed more uniform Medicaid 
eligibility standards nationally, higher Medicaid reimbursement rates and "more 
effective alternatives to inpatient treatment" for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many new outpatient treatments coming onto the scene," he noted. 
"Who is going to pay for them, especially with reimbursement schedules skewed 
toward inpatient care?" 
</P>
<P>
"The report points up the need for Medi-Cal to enrich its reimbursement rates 
for AIDS," said Edward Foley, the administrator of Los Angeles County 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal is California's version of Medicaid, the joint federal and state 
medical assistance program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Foley noted, public facilities such as Harbor and County-USC Medical 
Center take a disproportionate share of Los Angeles AIDS patients. "If Medi-Cal 
were to increase the reimbursement rate, hospitals like Kaiser, UCLA and 
Cedars-Sinai would be willing to take more of these patients," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that AIDS patients are disproportionately concentrated in a 
relatively small number of hospitals. For example, 5% of the hospitals in the 
survey treated more than 50% of the AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
With AIDS cases unevenly distributed throughout the country, the survey said 
that "it may become more difficult to draw broader political and community 
support for increased resources from areas and providers not influenced by the 
epidemic."

MEDICAL SCHOOLS ACCUSED OF LACK OF LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medical schools and teaching hospitals have failed to respond to some of the 
most pressing public health problems facing the United States, a group of 
researchers charged today in one of the country's most widely read medical 
journals. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems include skyrocketing medical costs, an infant mortality rate 
worse than that of Hong Kong, a glut of specialists, a dearth of generalists, 
doctor-caused illnesses and the spread of drug addiction, the group wrote in 
the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public trust is a very complicated and broad trust and that the 
performance of academic medicine has been uneven," said Dr. Steven A. 
Schroeder, an author of the paper and chief of general internal medicine at the 
UC San Francisco School of Medicine. "In some areas, it has done spectacularly; 
and in others, it hasn't paid much attention." 
</P>
<P>
The article, among the first to emerge from a five-year project aimed at 
prodding academic medicine to broaden its approach to public health, urged 
medical leaders to reach beyond mere biomedical research -- or risk losing 
public trust and funding. 
</P>
<P>
Preventive medicine should receive greater priority, the researchers said, 
adding that public health could be improved dramatically by even small advances 
in discouraging smoking or encouraging screening for diseases like hypertension 
and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Medical school teaching must extend beyond the hospital to nursing homes and 
patients' homes, the researchers said, noting that medicine should be practiced 
there in the future in light of the aging population and changes in health care 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
"Academic medicine . . . has the opportunity to exert leadership to help our 
society come to grips with these (social and economic) problems," Schroeder 
said in a telephone interview. " . . . I think, on the whole, the leadership 
has been lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's critique, coming at a time of re-evaluation in many medical 
schools, was received coolly by some in academic medicine. While some conceded 
a need for a broader focus, they said Schroeder placed unreasonable 
expectations on their institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Petersdorf, president of the Assn. of American Medical Colleges, 
wrote in an accompanying editorial in the journal that academic medicine could 
not be held accountable for such social ills as infant mortality, teen-age 
pregnancy and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of what Schroeder suggested I agree with," Petersdorf said in a telephone 
interview. "But in many instances there isn't a hell of a lot that we can do 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Can we do better? We certainly can, and are trying," said Dr. Gerard N. 
Burrow, dean of the UC San Diego School of Medicine. "But can we take 
responsibility for the ills of society? I think the answer to that is no." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder credited the nation's network of 127 medical schools with many 
successes in biomedical research, development of technology and progress 
against heart disease and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
But the researchers faulted academic medicine for neglecting the current 
failings of American medicine -- for example, an infant mortality rate that 
ranks 19th in the world amid annual expenditures that amount to 11.4% of the 
U.S. gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
They traced part of the inflation in health care costs to expensive operations 
developed and practiced widely at academic medical centers. The use of those 
procedures at those centers and others makes it difficult to encourage 
technological or economic restraint, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Other failings that the researchers contend have received inadequate attention 
from medical leaders included high rates of doctor-induced illness among 
hospitalized patients, unnecessary use of some lucrative procedures and 
under-use of medical services by the poor.

WINGED ROCKET PARES COST OF LOFTING PAYLOAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In what was billed as a preview of high-tech, low-cost space flight, a 
satellite-deploying rocket that will be launched from the belly of a B-52 
bomber was unveiled here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pegasus Air-Launched Space Booster is designed to deliver small to 
medium-sized payloads into orbit around the Earth at a cost two to three times 
less than that offered by current launch systems. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a 22-foot delta wing, Pegasus combines new technology with previous 
Navy and Air Force missile designs, explained Pegasus chief engineer Antonio 
Elias. Elias designed the rocket for the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the delta wing and an array of navigational microelectronics, 
the 50-foot-long, non-reusable Pegasus uses lightweight graphite composite 
materials for most of its body. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we use an airplane as our first (rocket) stage, we don't have to incur 
the expense of a throw-away first stage or of a launch pad that would require 
substantial refurbishment after each launch," Orbital Sciences President David 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although its first flight will deploy a Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency satellite to help track Soviet submarines for the military, company 
officials predict that Pegasus' low cost will allow smaller countries, states 
and even universities the opportunity to orbit satellites and to participate in 
space experiments. 
</P>
<P>
"At $6 million per launch, we've lowered the threshold for customers to get 
into space," said Orbital Sciences spokeswoman Barbara Zadina. Zadina and 
others cited the cost of between $30 million and $100 million normally charged 
by NASA for satellite deployment as a limiting factor for many potential space 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Orbital Sciences is particularly interested in tapping the European market and 
has signed an agreement with Arianespace, based in France, to sell Pegasus 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Heyden, president of Arianespace USA, a division of Arianespace Europe, 
said the market for Pegasus overseas should develop now that the technology 
exists. "People will develop payloads to do certain specific missions that will 
use the Pegasus capability," Heyden said. 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus' maiden flight is scheduled for October when it will be launched over 
the Pacific Ocean near the California coast. Five seconds after being released 
from the underside of a NASA B-52 at an altitude of about 40,000 feet, the 
first of Pegasus' three solid-fuel engines will thrust the rocket to a speed of 
Mach 8, or eight times the speed of sound, and using the delta wing for lift, 
carry it to an altitude of 200,000 feet before disengaging. From there the 
second and third-stage engines will take the craft to higher altitudes before 
releasing its orbital payload at the desired point. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the military satellite, Pegasus on its first flight is scheduled 
to deploy two canisters of barium gas as part of a NASA experiment to study 
Earth's magnetic field. Originally slated to be carried aboard a NASA LTV Scout 
booster, the experiment is expected to cost $10 million less aboard Pegasus, 
according to the trade publication Aviation Week and Space Technology. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental satellite for the state of Virginia has also been tentatively 
scheduled aboard the first flight, Orbital Sciences' Zadina said. However, she 
said, those negotiations are still under way.

RAMPAGE IN ESCONDIDO;

<P>
SUICIDES SPOTLIGHT PROBLEMS IN AGENCY

<P>
Two weeks before John Merlin Taylor went on a shooting rampage at an Escondido 
postal station, another veteran San Diego-area letter carrier hanged himself in 
Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
Like Taylor, whom colleagues described as "mellow and nice as could be," postal 
workers said William Camp, 62, was "very well liked and very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
But on July 28, the retired mailman slipped a noose around his neck in his 
garage. One of his four sons found the body. 
</P>
<P>
Camp's colleagues said they could understand -- if not condone -- his actions. 
They understood the forces that drove Camp to take his own life: It was the 
U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
Camp's death was the fourth suicide of a postal worker in San Diego County this 
year, and there has been at least one other in years past. 
</P>
<P>
On March 25, in a highly publicized incident, 44-year-old letter carrier Donald 
Mace walked into the lobby of the Poway Post Office, put a .38-caliber revolver 
to his head and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Before he died, Mace had mailed a rambling suicide letter to the news media 
complaining about his medical and financial problems and had told of harassment 
by his supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
On March 23, postal clerk Hector Rubio, 40, hanged himself with a leather belt 
at his Pacific Beach home. His wife, Barbara, found the body. A 20-year veteran 
of the Postal Service, Rubio reportedly had drinking problems. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, Jay Fanum, a letter carrier since 1980 at the Encinitas Post 
Office, killed himself in his Vista home. Postal Service officials said Fanum 
was going through employee counseling at the time of his death and indicated 
that his problems may have been marital. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, postal clerk Hector Torres, who colleagues said was having 
problems at work, jumped to his death off the Coronado Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The suicides have generated strong criticism of the Postal Service in San Diego 
and focused attention on employee violence and stress-related problems among 
workers in the postal agency. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, dozens of people -- ranging from postmasters to carriers -- 
have been murdered or wounded by their co-workers at postal facilities around 
the country. In the past 3 1/2 years, the Postal Service has recorded 355 
instances in which employees assaulted supervisors and 183 in which supervisors 
assaulted employees. An untold number of postal workers nationwide have killed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Postal Service say that in its quest to cope with volume that 
last year totaled 160 billion pieces of mail, the agency has extracted a human 
toll on its employees and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, while conceding that there is a problem, nonetheless maintains that 
employee violence -- from suicide to murder -- is no greater in the Postal 
Service than in other sectors of the business world. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any more or any less problems than face society today, whether 
we're talking about drugs or just plain bad temper," said Lou Eberhardt, a 
Postal Service spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Once an official part of the federal government called the Post Office 
Department, the agency was reorganized in 1971 as a semi-private company called 
the U.S. Postal Service. Most of its employees are unionized but are forbidden 
to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with mounting expenses and declining revenues, the Postal Service is 
currently trying to boost productivity while keeping costs down. 
</P>
<P>
Some union leaders complain that in striving to meet these goals, postal 
supervisors are placing added pressures on workers, resulting in work speedups 
and employee complaints -- and occasionally workplace violence. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the nation was stunned when part-time mailman Patrick Sherrill 
killed 14 co-workers, wounded six others and then committed suicide at the 
Edmond, Okla., post office. Sherrill, a man with an unstable personal history, 
had often talked about getting revenge on his bosses, who considered his work 
unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service said events like the massacre in Edmond could happen 
anywhere in society, contending that people with problems in their personal 
lives often will transfer them to their work. 
</P>
<P>
But the Edmond rampage was not an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot Three People 
</P>
<P>
A mail sorter held his ex-girlfriend hostage and shot three people during a 
13-hour siege at the main New Orleans post office last December. One co-worker 
lost an eye in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, there have been repeated murders and, in one case, a beating 
committed by postal employees against co-workers or supervisors in Chelsea, 
Mass.; Dallas; New York City; Anniston, Ala., and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Camp's suicide created such an uproar among his co-workers in El 
Cajon that all last week some workers wore black armbands in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Management didn't like it, but they did it anyway," a woman postal clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
Camp, colleagues said, had loved working for the Postal Service. But after 
amassing 2,500 hours of sick leave, they said he was reprimanded for taking a 
sick day off just before he left on vacation earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came back from vacation, they started hassling him, so he retired," 
said John Worthy, a union representative. 
</P>
<P>
Camp's condition deteriorated, they said. He tried to starve himself and lost 
30 to 40 pounds before his sons talked him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks later, Camp hanged himself. 
</P>
<P>
At the El Cajon Post Office where Camp had worked, there was a bomb threat on 
Aug. 1. Police evacuated the building for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Criticism 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Postmaster Margaret Sellers has been the target of strong criticism 
from some postal workers in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers' spokesman, Glenn Krouch, acknowledged in a telephone interview that 
most critics blame Sellers' policies for the rash of violent incidents, 
including suicides, that have plagued postal employees in the county recently. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard the criticism and heard it in a number of different lines," Krouch 
said. "Margaret is very upset by things like that. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very personable person. Employees are our top resource and asset. 
We're definitely a service organization run by people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Preston Chips, a U.S. Department of Labor certified counselor who has 
counseled San Diego-area postal employees since 1981, said Sellers' management 
style and policies have led to countless incidents of harassment in local post 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"Any organization reflects the policy of the person at the top," Chips said. 
"Margaret Sellers is a much hated person because of her policies." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chips, the Postal Service in San Diego has "an unwritten policy" 
of discouraging employees from filing and pursuing disability claims when they 
are injured on the job. Chips said the practice contributes greatly to the 
stress that overburdened postal employees are already under.

GORBACHEV REPORTED MISLED ON PRISONERS 
</P>

<P>
Two American congressmen who visited a notorious Soviet prison camp said 
Thursday that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is being misled by officials who 
tell him there are no longer any political prisoners in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the congressmen said, most of the prisoners they interviewed Wednesday 
at Perm Camp 35, 1,000 miles from Moscow in the Ural Mountains, told them they 
had been imprisoned for such offenses as trying to emigrate or to form groups 
to monitor human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We spoke to 24 of the 38 prisoners held in Perm, and most of them declared 
they were political prisoners," Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) said. 
</P>
<P>
He said prisoners told them that as punishment, they were placed in isolation 
cells with cement platforms for beds and denied sheets or blankets, even though 
the cells were icy cold in winter. Some said that for years, they were denied 
mail or visits from relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to close the camp down," Wolf said. "It's a terrible place and 
ought not to be in existence." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) said that Gorbachev, who told the United 
Nations in November that all political prisoners had been released, was 
probably speaking in good faith but "may have been misled by his own people." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he was told that Gorbachev had never personally visited Perm. It 
appears, he said, that many prison officials "have not yet been de-Stalinized" 
-- a reference to the dictator Josef Stalin, who sent millions of political 
opponents to prison camps or into exile. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen, the first American lawmakers to visit the prison camp, 
declined to specify how many of the inmates of Perm they believe are there for 
political reasons. They said they had spoken to some of the prisoners for only 
5 or 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Richard M. Stephenson Jr., a State Department officer who 
accompanied the congressmen, the department knows of more than 100 prisoners of 
conscience in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indirect Confirmation 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson said that the prison official who runs Perm 35, Lt. Col. Nikolai 
Osin, indirectly acknowledged that there are prisoners of conscience. He said 
that after the congressmen toured Perm, Osin said, "Can you tell us about your 
political prisoners, now that you have seen ours?" 
</P>
<P>
The prison camp, named for the industrial town of Perm that is situated nearby, 
acquired a reputation for inhuman conditions after former prisoners -- among 
them Natan Sharansky, a former refusenik who now lives in Israel -- told their 
stories to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen praised Soviet officials for permitting them to visit the camp. 
They said this was a case of bringing "glasnost to the gulag" -- openness to 
the Soviet prison camp system. 
</P>
<P>
They said Perm appeared to have been dressed up for their visit, with walls 
freshly whitewashed, floors polished and flowers placed in the barracks. 
</P>
<P>
But they said they remain convinced that prison conditions are terrible. They 
said that if the Soviet Union does not make improvements before the Helsinki 
Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to take place here in 1991, the Kremlin 
may well be embarrassed by criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen said some of the prisoners told them that they had been 
punished for speaking to A. M. Rosenthal, a New York Times columnist and former 
executive editor, who in December, 1988, was the first Westerner to visit Perm 
35. Some inmates, they said, told them that prison officials refused to give 
them packages sent by their families and denied them showers. 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson said the kind of punishments meted out at Perm "seemed well 
calculated to break a man's will." For example, he said, prisoners were often 
denied protection from the cold and refused small treats like chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
But the congressmen described the camp's inmates as "proud and courageous."

Walkouts spread Thursday in Estonia to include up to 20,000 workers, and 
protest leaders said they had no plans to call off the 2-day-old protest 
against a new election law, reports from the Baltic republic said. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to stop the strike, the Estonian parliament passed a resolution 
Thursday suspending all strikes at enterprises and organizations in Estonia, 
Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
The strike by non-Estonian workers was sparked by a new law that tightens 
residency requirements for voting and holding office. Non-Estonian residents of 
the republic complain that the law, which was passed Tuesday by the republic's 
parliament, is aimed against them because many are new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Strike committee member Artur Kopykin refused to estimate the number of 
strikers but said 37 enterprises had joined the walkout.

CAMBODIA ACCORD WOULD HELP TIES, U.S. TELLS HANOI AND BEIJING

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration has told both Vietnam and China that it is ready for 
friendlier relations if the two nations can pressure their Communist allies 
into participating in a balanced political settlement for Cambodia, according 
to a senior U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of a bellwether," the official said of the Cambodia peace talks 
going on in Paris. "If we get a positive outcome, it will brighten the overall 
mood. . . . The Vietnamese want to normalize (diplomatic relations) with us. 
The Chinese want to look like good guys." 
</P>
<P>
The official acknowledged that the United States has very little direct 
influence with the political factions in Cambodia, which include two Communist 
and two non-Communist groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said Washington has far more leverage with China and Vietnam, which in turn 
carry substantial weight with the two most contentious Cambodian factions, the 
Vietnamese-installed government of Premier Hun Sen and the murderous Khmer 
Rouge who ruled the country from 1975 through 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has long sought better relations with the United States, in part to 
persuade Washington to end its veto of World Bank and other international 
reconstruction loans to Hanoi. China wants to repair its relationship with the 
United States and other Western nations after its violent suppression of a 
pro-democracy movement in June. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-nation Cambodia conference that began July 30 already has agreed to 
insist on a comprehensive settlement to end a decade of Vietnamese occupation 
and install a coalition government to guide Cambodia from its bloody past to a 
peaceful and nonaligned future. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cambodian factions have not agreed to cooperate -- or even to refrain 
from shooting at each other. 
</P>
<P>
From Washington's viewpoint, the key to any settlement is persuading the Hun 
Sen regime and the Khmer Rouge to play a subordinate role in an interim 
government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former head of state and the 
leader of one of two non-Communist factions. The second non-Communist group is 
headed by former Prime Minister Son Sann. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their shared Marxist ideology, the Hun Sen government and the Khmer 
Rouge are enemies that have been fighting for decades and have continued their 
squabble at the Paris conference table. 
</P>
<P>
The senior official said that if an accommodation could be reached between 
Vietnam and China, antagonists in a brief border war in early 1979, it would go 
a long way toward persuading their Cambodian allies. Vietnam provides weapons 
and political support to Hun Sen, while China supplies the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
The official expressed guarded optimism that the Paris talks would produce a 
settlement among the Cambodian factions, although "these people, to a man, have 
been fighting among themselves for three or four decades." 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge, under Pol Pot, caused the deaths of an estimated 1 million 
Cambodians by killings, starvation and disease when they controlled the 
country. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, driving the Khmer Rouge from 
power and installing the government now led by Hun Sen. Vietnam has promised to 
withdraw its troops by the end of September. If the Cambodian factions are 
unable to reach agreement, the departure of the Vietnamese could produce a 
power vacuum and a renewed civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Alan D. Romberg, a former State Department official who is now an Asian studies 
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said that despite the 
centrifugal forces driving the Cambodian factions apart, pressure is increasing 
on both the Cambodians and their sponsors to reach an accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Relationship 
</P>
<P>
"For Vietnam in particular, the relationship with the United States -- which 
includes not just direct relations but also the U.S. green light for 
international financial institutions to participate in reconstruction of the 
country -- is very important to Hanoi," Romberg said. "If the Chinese are 
really convinced that the Vietnamese have withdrawn, they have no interest in 
promoting the Khmer Rouge as a dominant force in Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
Romberg noted, however, that China and Vietnam may not be able to force their 
allies to go along with a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Khmer Rouge are controlled by any means by China," he said. 
"Hun Sen, while he would be strongly influenced by his relationship with the 
Vietnamese -- if he thought he was being sold out, he would not go along." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Romberg said that China probably could prevent the Khmer Rouge 
from regaining total control by halting the supply of weapons and other 
equipment. "Without a continuing flow of weapons and military supplies, the 
Khmer Rouge can cause problems but not, in the end, win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poor Track Record 
</P>
<P>
George A. Carver, a former deputy director of the CIA, was far less optimistic 
about the possibility of settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who have the guns are the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese," said 
Carver, now a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 
Washington. "We would like to think the Chinese will make their proteges 
behave, but their track record is not very good. There is no solution that 
would be equally acceptable in Hanoi and Beijing, so the chances of them 
cutting a sweetheart deal are between negligible and nil. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep hoping that other people will solve things so we will not have to face 
up to the thorny problems," Carver said, "but I don't think they will."

SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE ROUT 47 IN 'COMMOTION' AT COURTHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
BLACKS FIGHT CHARGES OVER SINGING ON A TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When 47 blacks gathered outside the courthouse here Thursday to fight citations 
for singing on a commuter train, police ordered them and dozens of their 
supporters to disperse and chased them as they fled, beating them with whips. 
</P>
<P>
That "commotion," attorney Azhar Cachalia explained to the judge an hour later, 
was why his clients were not present to face the charge -- the misdemeanor of 
"objectionable behavior" for singing freedom songs on the 6:05 a.m. train from 
Tembisa township to Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Just to be sure, though, bailiffs leaned outside the courtroom to shout each 
defendant's name three times in the empty corridor. There was no reply. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of 460 singing commuters in the last two months reflects a renewed 
crackdown on even the most fundamental levels of black protest as the 
government prepares for Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, in which blacks have 
no vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New 'Defiance Campaign' 
</P>
<P>
But the willingness of blacks to fight the minor charges -- and risk 
confrontation with the police -- is an outgrowth of a new "defiance campaign" 
of civil disobedience mounted by leading anti-apartheid organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Unrest and clashes with the police have increased sharply in recent days, and 
law-and-order officials have vowed to move swiftly against activists who "act 
defiantly and openly ignore police warnings." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's trouble in the white Johannesburg suburb of Kempton Park had its 
roots in an incident that occurred last month, when police arrested 47 people 
on the train. The authorities have frequently arrested large groups of 
commuters since early June, although blacks have been singing liberation songs 
on the trains for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just singing our songs, like church people sing," said Yoliswa Pokela, 
a 45-year-old secretary. "It was a peaceful act." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the defendants could have avoided a court appearance by paying fines of 
less than $20 that would have been an admission of guilt. But they decided to 
force the government to prove its case. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't just pay a fine," said Phineas Rambidi, 37, a factory mechanic. "I 
didn't disturb anyone on that train." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrested singers belong to unions affiliated with the Congress of 
South African Trade Unions (COSATU), the giant, predominantly black labor 
federation and anti-apartheid leader. 
</P>
<P>
An anti-apartheid coalition led by COSATU and other organizations launched the 
nationwide defiance campaign last week, and COSATU has exchanged heated words 
in recent days with Adriaan Vlok, law-and-order chief in the white minority-led 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just harassment," Khalik Mayet, one of the defendants' attorneys, said of 
the charges. "Songs are a very effective way of spreading ideas and culture, 
and the government thinks if it can stop the singing, it can stop the spread of 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 460 blacks arrested on the trains, some have paid their fines while 362 
are fighting formal charges, which range from committing acts that "endanger 
other passengers" to using obscene language. Thursday's case was postponed 
until November. 
</P>
<P>
Pokela was headed for work from her home in Tembisa on July 6 when police 
arrested her and several dozen others and issued them summonses, the equivalent 
of a traffic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
While the defendants and about 200 singing supporters were waiting outside the 
doors of the courthouse here Thursday, the police declared it an illegal 
gathering and, in the melee that followed, at least 18 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
A black woman with her son, accused of theft in another court case, had a large 
bloodstain on her dress and tears in her eyes. She said she had been whipped 
twice by police officers and then trampled by fleeing protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Policemen chased activists across four lanes of traffic into nearby 
neighborhoods. About two blocks away, they ordered about 60 blacks to disperse 
and, as the group turned to leave, charged them with sjamboks -- whips. About 
20 activists were arrested, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"What breaks my heart is that the people who are being harassed don't even know 
what's going on," said Pokela, who huddled against a fence to avoid the 
charging police. "We tell the people, 'You will not be beaten because of 
politics, but because of the color of your skin.' " 
</P>
<P>
Black commuters use railway coaches to discuss anti-apartheid politics because 
under the state of emergency, outdoor political meetings are prohibited. Labor 
researchers say the trains have become one of the main ways that black 
political organizations and political culture have been kept alive in the face 
of the government's restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The train meetings continue, despite the recent arrests, "but I must admit the 
system is beginning to break our spirit," Pokela said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the government has filed more serious charges of public 
violence against the train singers, and several dozen have had to post bond of 
about $150 while they await trial. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys say they doubt that the state can prove that singing 
constitutes public violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what they're singing that's at issue," attorney Mayet said. "It's 
who's doing the singing. But they can't prosecute people for singing on trains. 
It happens all over the world."

MILITANT N.Y. JEWISH LEADER FIRES ON RIVAL 
</P>

<P>
A confrontation between the leaders of two militant Jewish organizations 
erupted into gunfire in New York's Greenwich Village Thursday, resulting in the 
wounding of a 69-year-old bystander. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Brooklyn-born Mordechai Levy, 27, chairman of the Jewish 
Defense Organization (JDO), for firing a semiautomatic assault rifle at Los 
Angeles resident Irv Rubin, national director of the Jewish Defense League 
(JDL), and two others. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Levy fired "numerous" shots from the roof of a four-story 
brownstone apartment, missing Rubin and his companions, but hitting Dominic 
Pinelli, 69, in the left knee as he sat in a green van parked on the street. 
Pinelli was hospitalized in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surrenders to Police 
</P>
<P>
Scores of officers responded to a sniper call shortly after noon and stood by 
as a hostage negotiator talked to Levy, who surrendered to police about 2 1/2 
hours later. Police found several rifles in his room, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was afraid that people were coming to kill him," said Police Chief Robert 
J. Johnston Jr. "We got him to surrender by essentially telling him that we 
would take care of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Levy was taken to the 9th Precinct House and later charged with four counts of 
attempted murder and one count each of first-degree assault and criminal 
possession of a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnston, Rubin, private investigator Steve Rombom and a process 
server, whose identity was not immediately known, went to Levy's house and 
office at 6 Bleecker St. at midday to serve a legal paper in connection with a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin had accused Levy of libel in a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court 
late last month. Rubin is seeking millions in damages on behalf of himself and 
his wife, Shelly, for statements Levy purportedly made on a radio station KFI 
talk show, hosted by Tom Leykis, on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
The action charges that Levy falsely accused Rubin of drug dealing, extortion, 
and money laundering and wrongly claimed that Shelly Rubin had once tried to 
commit suicide while she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin and Levy have been in dispute for years, according to NYPD Lt. David 
Nadel, a police liaison officer with the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
"Levy left the JDL about 7 or 8 years ago. . . . He formed his own 
organization, the JDO, and they've been at odds with the JDL since then," Nadel 
said. "Mordechai had a following of a couple dozen people, that's all. Levy 
claimed the JDO was more activist than the JDL." 
</P>
<P>
Levy, the self-proclaimed enemy of "skin heads" and Nazis, runs a Jewish 
survival camp in the Catskills, where he teaches people how to fire weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Robert I. Friedman, author and writer from the Village Voice who is working on 
a story about the Jewish militant movement, told New York Newsday: 
</P>
<P>
"There is a bitter personality dispute between Mordechai and Irv, and Mordechai 
and Irv's wife, a feud that has been continuing bicoastally for three or four 
years. . . . They have been harassing each other for years. It's not political. 
It's personal." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin could not be reached for comment Thursday, but in Los Angeles, Jan 
Tucker, who described himself as a JDL investigator, said: "We've been warning 
law enforcement groups that this guy (Levy) was as dangerous as a heart attack 
for years."

RESCUERS FIND MORE VICTIMS OF MEXICO TRAIN CRASH; 112 DEAD

<P>
Rescue teams searching along the San Rafael River on Thursday found bodies as 
far as 14 miles downstream from the site of a rail disaster that killed at 
least 112 people, the government news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of injured reached 205, the Notimex agency quoted state security 
coordinator Jose Carlos Saracho as saying, but hospital officials said most 
victims were treated for minor injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Transportation Department said the 11-car train, carrying about 360 
people, plunged off a bridge Wednesday morning in the wake of torrential rains, 
and several cars fell about 25 feet into the river in northwestern Mexico. The 
train was bound from the Pacific coastal resort of Mazatlan to Mexicali, on the 
California border. 
</P>
<P>
A department statement said the area had experienced its worst rainstorm in the 
last 50 years just before the crash. It said 2 inches of rain in six hours 
caused a dam to overflow, and the resulting torrent washed out supports for the 
bridge, which collapsed under the train's weight. 
</P>
<P>
The train, popularly known as "The Burro" because it stops at almost every 
station along the 900-mile route, is patronized almost entirely by poor 
Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Lopez, the Red Cross duty officer in Los Mochis, 60 miles northeast of 
the crash site, said most of those on the train had apparently been sleeping 
and that most of the victims drowned. 
</P>
<P>
No Americans have been reported among the dead, said Dan Sainz, U.S. vice 
consul in Mazatlan, but he said that bodies were still being found. Most bodies 
were still unidentified. All those identified so far were Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Sinaloa state Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa said Thursday that the national 
railroad was providing food, clothing, shelter and about $200 each for 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
At least three foreigners survived the wreck. A spokeswoman at a travel agency 
in Guasave said that two men and a woman from Manchester, England, came to the 
agency for help, washed the mud off their clothes, ate and headed for San Diego 
by bus. 
</P>
<P>
Many reports referred to people missing, but it appeared that many survivors 
simply walked away and left the area. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents are frequent on the rundown Mexican railway, but this was by far the 
worst this decade. A railroad spokesman said it was not the worst in Mexican 
history, but he could not list a more serious one.

ARTS FESTIVAL TRIPS UP FUND-RAISER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME STOPPERS' RUN BECOMES VICTIM OF SCHEDULING SNAFU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual fund-raising run sponsored by Crime Stoppers has fallen victim to 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor's Soviet arts festival in a scheduling snafu that has 
the city and the local law-enforcement booster group holding each other 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups want control of the streets near the Civic Theatre on the night of 
Oct. 21 -- Crime Stoppers for the 16,000 runners and spectators expected to 
participate in its third annual 10-kilometer fund-raiser, the city to protect 
dignitaries expected for the opening night of O'Connor's highly publicized 
"Treasures of the Soviet Union" featuring the opera "Boris Godunov." 
</P>
<P>
Something had to give, and it wasn't going to be the opera. 
</P>
<P>
"We were under the definite impression that the Oct. 21 date was ours, that 
(the city) knew about it, and we could go ahead," said Molly Wilson-Cartmill, 
executive director of Crime Stoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Crime Stoppers hasn't submitted the formal application package needed 
to guarantee the date because it is still making final adjustments to the 10K 
route, organizers say they have been speaking with city officials about the 
date since the 1988 race. This year would mark the third year of the race, 
traditionally held on the Saturday night before Halloween, which falls during 
the annual Crime Prevention Month. 
</P>
<P>
Crime Stoppers pays out rewards to anonymous tipsters who help police solve 
crimes. The number of payoffs has been especially high during the past three 
months, and the run is the organization's largest fund-raising event, 
Wilson-Cartmill said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson-Cartmill said she and another staff member have told Peg Nugent, the 
city's special events coordinator, about the date on several occasions, most 
recently during a daytime march against crime staged by O'Connor in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working With Police to Set Route 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the organization has been working with the San Diego Police 
Department for several months to set the route, which starts at the Omni Hotel 
and winds north up 5th Avenue toward Balboa Park before doubling back down 6th 
Avenue to Market Street and back to the hotel. The group also plans to close 
the 6th Avenue exit off northbound Interstate 5 for the race, held at night to 
make a statement about making streets safe. 
</P>
<P>
But Nugent, festival director Bruce Herring and mayoral arts aide Sal Giametta 
claim that they first heard of the Crime Stoppers plan July 26, when a Crime 
Stoppers board member phoned to determine whether the race would conflict with 
the arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that timing for the arts festival was determined more than a year ago, 
Herring said it would be impossible to flood downtown streets with flash 
light-toting runners, given the chance that national and international 
dignitaries may be attending the opera. President Bush and Soviet leader 
Mikhail Gorbachev are among the invitees. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect some VIPs and dignitaries to be there that night," Herring said. 
"We're concerned about security, traffic control and the general confusion that 
you would have trying to do two major events at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Nugent also cited a 2-year-old city ordinance requiring approval of a written 
application package to guarantee a date, a law passed expressly to avoid 
situations like these. Wilson-Cartmill said that she could not submit the 
application until final adjustments in the route are completed. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson-Cartmill said that Herring offered subsequent Saturday nights Oct. 28 
and Nov. 4, then retracted the offers. Crime Stoppers now is polling its 
sponsors about the city's latest offer, Sunday, Nov. 12. The event must be held 
before the start of the Christmas shopping season to garner support of downtown 
merchants who are traditional sponsors, Wilson-Cartmill said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that crime is an important issue to this city, and we do a lot to 
help," Wilson-Cartmill said. "I don't think they're doing this to us on 
purpose, but it's just a shame that we can't do it when we want to do it."

<P>
</P>
<P>
'Model Employee' 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in his postal uniform and described as a "model employee in a model 
station," Taylor aimed the .22-caliber, semiautomatic Sturm Ruger pistol at 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
"He pulled the trigger," said Collins, recalling how Taylor stood a few feet 
away and leveled the barrel at him. "He pulled the trigger, but it didn't fire. 
I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
As Taylor fumbled for more ammunition, Collins had to choose quickly between 
disarming him and running. He ran. 
</P>
<P>
"He was reloading when I ran through the door," Collins said. "I yelled at 
everybody else to 'Get out! Get out! Get out!' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Escondido police, the 52-year-old Taylor killed three people: his 
wife at home, Elizabeth, and two close friends and fellow workers sitting on a 
bench outside the suburban station, Ron Williams and Richard J. Berni. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wounds Clerk in Arm 
</P>
<P>
He also wounded Paul DeRisi, a postal window clerk who took a bullet in the 
left arm. Another postal employee, Phyllis DeVito, suffered serious facial cuts 
and bruises when she fell head-first down a flight of stairs while scrambling 
to leave the building and escape the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Taylor turned the handgun on himself and fired a bullet into the right 
side of his head. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that, sometime before 7:35 a.m., Taylor shot his wife to death, 
left his home and parked his gold, 1974 Plymouth Duster in the postal building 
parking lot. It was about the time he arrived at the post office most workdays. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning, he would meet co-workers Williams and Berni at a small park bench 
outside the office, where they would drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. They 
met there because smoking was not allowed inside, and they would talk about 
sports, families and their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had been shot once, struck slightly behind the forehead, his body 
slumped over to the right of the table top. Berni was shot in the front part of 
his body, and fell backward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of Struggle 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of a struggle. A coffee cup rested on a chair, maybe spilled 
a little. A newspaper, which apparently had been read once, was folded back 
neatly. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the station, the dozen employees heard the gunfire, but thought it was 
either fireworks, a car backfiring or metal trays clattering. 
</P>
<P>
DeRisi, a window clerk at the front counter, stepped back inside to check on 
whether another worker had arrived when he spotted Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"John Taylor walked through the side door," said DeRisi, 30, who has worked 
five years for the postal service. 
</P>
<P>
"He had his arm up like he was waving. I said, 'Good morning,' and then I heard 
a pop. I noticed he had a gun in his hand and the second shot went through my 
arm." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was less than 50 feet from DeRisi when he fired. DeRisi staggered but 
didn't fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize I was shot," he said. "I grabbed my arm, and I felt the 
blood. I took off for the front door, and another bullet passed by me, on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran next door to a restaurant and told them to call the police. I sat down 
outside and said to myself, 'Why John Taylor? Why is he doing this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Others were also scrambling to get out, and station manager Bob Henley walked 
outside his office to see what was wrong. He saw DeRisi bleeding from the arm, 
running for the door. And then Henley looked right into the face of John 
Taylor. And Taylor spoke to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'm not going to shoot you,' " Henley recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Taylor fired the gun to the side, the bullet whizzing past him. "I 
went back in and closed my office door," Henley said. "I called 911." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chamber Was Empty 
</P>
<P>
In the hallway, Taylor spun around, spotted Collins, and attempted to shoot him 
too. The trigger slammed, but the chamber was empty. Collins fled. Taylor 
dropped the box of shells and two ammunition magazines he was carrying in his 
other hand. 
</P>
<P>
Reginald Keith, a postal custodian, saw Taylor begin to reload, and then he 
watched him march down the hallway to the water foundation on the other side of 
the building. By now, according to police, 15 to 20 shots had been fired, many 
of them striking the walls and ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"It was startling," Keith said. "Some of the ammunition was spilled on the 
floor. I think it was a clip that went on the floor. Then he walked right by 
me. He had the gun pointed right at the floor. He kind of looked at me, but his 
eyes were kind of dazed." 
</P>
<P>
Postal clerk William Karlson, who had been standing in an aisle between 
10-foot-high mail bundles, said Taylor walked right by the aisle without seeing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked so cold, so determined," Karlson said. "I thought he was still 
looking for someone to shoot. I just tried to keep calm. I don't know if he 
would have shot me or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot Himself at Fountain 
</P>
<P>
At the water fountain, he shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
Another employee, Roger Hutchins, was screaming at workers to evacuate the 
building, possibly saving lives in the process, Karlson said. Hutchins shadowed 
Taylor's movements, and at one point talked to the gunman, Karlson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told him to put the gun down," Karlson said. "From what Roger told me, John 
said, 'OK, I won't shoot you,' and walked away. Then he put the gun to his 
head." 
</P>
<P>
After Taylor shot himself, Hutchins kicked the gun away and checked Taylor for 
a pulse. According to Chief Jimno, there was the barest beat. 
</P>
<P>
Even before police arrived, 27-year-old postal worker David Canales was pulling 
into the parking lot. He was late for work, and he could hear the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Canales said he was confused. He normally sat outside with the three smokers -- 
Taylor, Williams and Berni. He would join in on the conversation, and would 
have been there Thursday morning too had he not been late. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been dead too," he said.

$12-MILLION SAND SUCKER POOPS OUT ON OCEANSIDE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside's experimental sand bypass system, seven years in the works, was 
termed a smashing success last month after limited testing proved its prowess 
in sucking sand off the harbor floor. 
</P>
<P>
And it probably would still be a success, say officials at the Army Corps of 
Engineers, if only they could get the darned thing to work. 
</P>
<P>
Although the $12-million system worked beautifully during tests north of the 
harbor, the complex machinery inexplicably stalled after being moved last week 
to its permanent home at the harbor entrance. Corps of Engineers workers have 
labored throughout this week to find the cause of the malfunction but, as of 
Thursday, they were still in the dark, spokesman Jim Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
The sand at the harbor's mouth has buried the system's two jet pumps, causing 
them to clog and cease functioning, Crum said. Attempts at back-flushing the 
pipes with water have worked for a couple of hours at a time, but then the 
system breaks down again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bypass system was designed to vacuum sand off the harbor floor and pump it 
to Oceanside's eroded beaches, thus serving the dual purpose of ending 
expensive dredging and helping keep the beaches healthy. The federal government 
has fully funded the project, which has been touted as an experiment with 
potentially worldwide significance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the city of Oceanside that stands to benefit," said Dana 
Whitson, the city's special projects director. "It has potentially 
international benefits in revolutionizing the way harbors are dredged." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, although a bit dispirited at the system's sudden failure to function, 
said she still has faith in the project. "This is an experimental system and 
every little step of the way they are expecting challenges," she said. "I don't 
think this is an insurmountable setback." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside Mayor Larry Bagley also maintains confidence that the project will 
prove beneficial, but makes no bones about his belief that too many years and 
dollars have already been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it should have cost that much," Bagley said. And, he said, 
beach erosion has progressed so far in recent years that now the city can only 
expect the bypass system to maintain the existing beach sand, rather than 
replenish it. Sand will have to be trucked in for the purpose of enhancing the 
shoreline, Bagley said, adding, "If they'd gotten the darn thing completed 4 
1/2 years ago, when they said they would, that wouldn't be the case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had to Change Contractors 
</P>
<P>
City officials say most of the delay is attributable to the project's first 
contractor who, in Bagley's words, "was screwing it up." It took the Corps of 
Engineers about a year to remove the Irvine-based contractor, Maecon Inc., and 
six months to hire Healy Tibbitts Construction Co., the current contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The bypass system, a monstrous contraption of pumps and pipes, is built on a 
movable barge and designed to be raised out of the water on pylons during 
operation. The first test run in mid-June proved so effective at pumping sand 
that the machine had to be shut down after three hours because the pumps had 
pulled all the sand out of a crater created by the sucking action. 
</P>
<P>
That problem should be resolved within the next fiscal year, after the Corps 
receives an additional $2.6 million approved by the federal government for the 
project's second phase. The money will pay for the installation of perforated 
pipes called fluidizers, which will mix sand with water and cause the mixture 
to flow more readily to the crater created by the jet pump, according to 
Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature may be teaching us already the need for the second phase, 
although we didn't expect to learn it this way," Crum said. The fluidizers, he 
said, should remove the current difficulties because they will keep the sand 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an interesting project, and we are learning day by day," Crum said. 
"The bottom line is that we've had success, so we know the system works. Now 
we're just making the appropriate changes and modifications so it works more 
efficiently."

SEWAGE: SCRIPPS TAKES DIFFERENT TACK ON OUTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scripps Institution of Oceanography has objected to a proposed 
sewage-treatment plant in Sorrento Valley because the plant might include an 
ocean outfall pipe that would discharge treated waste water near a relatively 
pristine tract of ocean close to the prestigious institution. 
</P>
<P>
"It is vital to our operation" that nearby ocean waters "remain natural and 
unpolluted," Scripps Director Edward A. Frieman wrote in an April letter to San 
Diego sewage treatment officials detailing the institution's concerns about an 
encroachment in an area Scripps scientists have used for research projects for 
almost 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists say that Frieman's objection to the Sorrento Valley pipe 
contradicts claims made by individual Scripps scientists that the treated waste 
water pumped out through a Point Loma outfall pipe is actually a healthy 
addition to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Back-Yard Issue 
</P>
<P>
Frieman's letter, for example, has drawn fire from Richard McManus, a Cardiff 
resident who in 1986 formed People for a Clean Ocean, a citizens' group that 
supports secondary sewage treatment for waste water pumped into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
McManus on Thursday charged that Scripps "took a stand" on the growing 
controversy over pumping treated sewage into the ocean only because "it was in 
their own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
But Scripps "won't make a stand" in the ongoing debate over whether the Point 
Loma sewage treatment plant, which now offers advanced primary treatment, 
should be forced to add multibillion-dollar secondary treatment technology for 
San Diego's sewage, McManus said. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Frieman said that Scripps has intentionally remained neutral in 
the debate over the need for secondary treatment at Point Loma. Those Scripps 
scientists who have publicly opposed secondary treatment as expensive and 
unnecessary "have chosen to speak out as citizens, which they have an 
absolutely perfect right to do," Frieman said. "But, by in large," he said, 
"Scripps does not take positions on political issues." 
</P>
<P>
Frieman said his letter "was referring to pollution as anything that would 
cause a change in the state of that mass of water. . . . But I wasn't speaking 
of pollution in the negative sense . . . in terms of whether (an outfall) would 
produce harmful bacteria or pollution in that sense." 
</P>
<P>
Frieman on Thursday maintained that his letter was driven by researchers' fears 
that an ocean outfall pipe would hinder Scripps' research in nearby ocean water 
that has remained relatively free of man-made intrusions since the institution 
was founded in 1929. "We've got some of the longest continuous records that I 
know about anywhere in California," Frieman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Issue of Context' 
</P>
<P>
Frieman suggested that McManus might have been misled by the letter, which was 
not intended to address the controversy over secondary treatment at Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it wasn't the best choice of words," said Frieman, who maintained that 
the letter did not attempt to address political questions generated by debate 
over the need for secondary treatment the federal Environmental Protection 
Agency has required of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an issue of context," Frieman said. "I was speaking in the research 
context, not in the context of a societal or political issue." 
</P>
<P>
"They're backstepping and sidestepping," McManus complained. With the proposed 
Sorrento Valley sewage treatment plant, he said, "they took the position that, 
yes, there is an impact from these outfalls." Frieman said, continued McManus, 
that "we don't want one in our back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Frieman also wrote that a proposed outfall pipe north of Scripps' La Jolla 
campus would adversely affect the quality of nearly 2 million gallons of sea 
water that Scripps and the nearby Southwest Marine Fisheries center pump each 
day into laboratories and aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
"The water must be as pure and unpolluted as possible to ensure the health of 
the marine life we keep" in those facilities, according to Frieman's letter. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps scientists have argued that water quality and marine life at the mouth 
of the Point Loma outfall pipe would not benefit from the expensive secondary 
treatment equipment now required by the EPA. The scientists maintain the Point 
Loma plant's advanced primary treatment is sufficiently protecting the ocean, 
and that federal regulators should grant San Diego an exemption from the 
expensive secondary treatment requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps' concern over the location of a nearby outfall pipe has fallen off 
dramatically since April because the city plan calls for construction of a 
pipeline that would carry treated waste water from Sorrento Valley directly to 
Point Loma, where it would be released through an existing outfall pipe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fallback Plan 
</P>
<P>
The Sorrento Valley plant was included in a recently unveiled, $2.5-billion 
city plan that includes construction of six satellite treatment plants that 
would reclaim waste water for use in watering landscaped areas. Only not used 
for watering projects would be pumped into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city would prefer to pipe excess effluent to the Point Loma plant, 
a fallback plan calls for construction of a pipe extending into the ocean from 
a point to the north of Scripps' waterfront grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Under the fallback plan, the outfall pipe would be several miles to the north 
of the research area. But ocean currents and the ocean floor's topography would 
combine to carry effluent into the research area, according to Frieman's 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean currents have kept treated sewage from existing outfall pipes in San 
Diego County away from research instruments situated in the "Scripps Coastal 
Reserve" that extends a mile out to sea from the Scripps campus. The reserve 
extends south to include the La Jolla Underwater Park. 
</P>
<P>
Frieman wrote the letter to express researchers' concern that the introduction 
of treated sewage would affect Scripps' physical, chemical and biological 
research into the marine environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obvious Hypocrisy' 
</P>
<P>
Although Frieman defended his letter, Paul Dayton, a marine ecologist at 
Scripps who has argued against the need for secondary treatment at Point Loma, 
acknowledged that "on the face of it, there seems to be an obvious hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds hypocritical, but this is the only area in Southern California where 
there's not a pipe real close by," Dayton said. "It gets to be a societal 
question of whether (the coastal reserve) has a value to society that exceeds" 
the costs of protecting it from the impact of an ocean outfall. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense in California that the (waters offshore from Scripps) should 
be protected against encroachment," said Edward Goldberg, a highly regarded 
Scripps scientist who has opposed upgrading Point Loma's treatment plant to 
include secondary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here are the best scientific and technical information 
available," Goldberg said. "We transfer that to those who create and make 
public policy. We're not politicians, we're scientists."

City officials Thursday announced that an $80,000 grant from the San Diego 
Housing Commission will fund the efforts of the city's first Fair Housing 
Council, formed to combat housing discrimination citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The council will use the money to hire staff members who will educate renters, 
landlords, apartment owners and the public about the requirements of federal 
fair-housing laws. The organization will also take complaints from home seekers 
who believe they have been victims of discrimination and will send out 
anonymous white and minority volunteers to test for landlord bias. 
</P>
<P>
In a covert audit conducted last year, the Urban League of San Diego found that 
blacks seeking apartments in seven separate sections of the city faced 
discrimination 40% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The major goal of the Fair Housing Council will be to eliminate illegal 
housing discrimination through a strong educational program, solicitation of 
cooperation from all segments of the community and housing industry and 
improved enforcement," said Judith Green, president of the council's interim 
board of directors.

BLYTHE STREET GROUP OFFERS TO FINANCE POLICE PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apartment owners along a notoriously crime-ridden street in Panorama City took 
the unprecedented step Thursday of offering private money to increase police 
patrols in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The offer met with enthusiasm from a City Council member, but drew a warning 
from a police official who said it could lead to wealthier neighborhoods buying 
more security at the cost of less protection in poor areas. 
</P>
<P>
Five owners pledged $1,000 apiece and told city officials they believe another 
30 apartment owners along a half-mile stretch of Blythe Street between Van Nuys 
Boulevard and Brimfield Avenue are willing to pay to get drug dealers and gangs 
off the street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wares Sold From Curb 
</P>
<P>
The street has been plagued for years by drug dealers, who frequently rent 
local apartments and sell their wares from the curb, a stubborn problem that 
has returned after a two-year police campaign to crush the trade. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the City Council, the donation would mark the first time in city 
history that private money would be used to increase patrols, said Los Angeles 
Police Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
The department has previously accepted donations of office space, equipment, 
and clerical and interpretation services for police substations from merchants 
in such areas as Koreatown and Baldwin Hills, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor M. Meyerstein, who owns an apartment house in the area and suggested 
contributing the money, called Blythe Street "an isolated desert in an 
otherwise prosperous area. If we really want to get rid of the drug dealers, we 
have to put our money where our mouths are and pay for it," Meyerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Panorama City apartment owners manage to raise their goal of $35,000, 
the money would provide two uniformed officers to patrol the neighborhood eight 
hours a day on overtime pay for about 2 1/2 months, said Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Ron Seban. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi said he strongly supports the effort, which 
apartment owners discussed Thursday at a meeting Bernardi called to discuss 
drug activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The money would have to be donated to the city treasury and appropriated for 
police pay, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'll Try in Every Way' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try in every way I can to get this money through the council to the 
police," Bernardi said. 
</P>

"You've got a prison on Blythe Street right now, and your guards are the drug 
dealers. A lot has been done to clean up the area already, but we had to cut 
back when the money ran out. These people feel that added security is going to 
help them." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a special narcotics task force, composed of 13 uniformed 
officers borrowed from police divisions throughout the San Fernando Valley, 
which combed the area for drug dealers from July, 1987, until May of this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$50,000 Donated 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi donated more than $50,000 from his office budget to help pay for the 
task force, which made more than 500 arrests. At his suggestion, barricades 
were placed in the street to prevent drive-through traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The special patrol was disbanded in April. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Bureau Cmdr. Chet Spencer praised the apartment owners and managers for 
coming together to fight problems on Blythe, but said donating money for 
increased patrols might set an unfair precedent that would allow affluent 
neighborhoods to get better police protection than poorer areas. 
</P>
<P>
"You could have very wealthy communities make what amounts to political 
contributions which are earmarked for more security," Spencer said. "The poorer 
communities could be slighted."

HUGE RENT-CONTROLLED COMPLEX IN SAN PEDRO TO BE RAZED FOR CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southwinds Apartments -- by far the largest rent-controlled apartment 
complex in San Pedro -- have been vacated and will be torn down sometime within 
the next several months to make way for luxury condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The 174-unit Southwinds development catered to moderate-income tenants and, 
because its apartments are spacious, couples with children. Many tenants had 
lived at the complex for years -- decades in some cases -- and thus paid rents 
that were below market because of Los Angeles' rent control laws. 
</P>
<P>
By last week, six months after they first received eviction notices, all the 
tenants had moved out. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement of Southwinds with condominiums follows trends in San Pedro, 
where affordable housing is becoming more and more scarce as land prices spiral 
upward. 
</P>
<P>
City housing officials say the loss of Southwinds will have a significant 
effect on the San Pedro rental market, where the average rent in 1988 was $694 
-- compared to about $475 for new residents at Southwinds. But many tenants 
were paying much less than that, some as little as $300 for a three-bedroom 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really very sad because those buildings are basically sound," said 
Barbara Zeidman, director of the city's rent stabilization program. "San Pedro 
has very few large housing complexes, period. (Southwinds) is certainly the 
last large block of more moderate rental units." 
</P>
<P>
Southwinds, which sprawls over 9.3 acres between Western and Weymouth avenues, 
north of 19th Street, will be replaced with 163 two- and three-bedroom 
townhomes, according to San Pedro developer Eugene Bozulich. 
</P>
<P>
Bozulich purchased the Southwinds complex with his partner, John Trutanich, in 
1984. He would not disclose the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
The townhomes, which Bozulich said will sell for at least $300,000, will range 
in size from 2,000 to 2,700 square feet and will have various amenities, 
including fireplaces and two- and three-car garages. 
</P>
<P>
The development, which Bozulich said will cost "in excess of $30 million to 
build," will go up in phases and should be complete by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be an asset to San Pedro," Bozulich said. "We're very proud of this 
development. We're not out-of-towners just trying to make a buck and leave and 
build a shabby project." 
</P>
<P>
But before Bozulich and Trutanich begin construction, they must first move 48 
of the Southwinds apartments to a site elsewhere in Los Angeles, to comply with 
a requirement imposed by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the requirement is intended to compensate for the loss of 
rental housing when Southwinds is demolished. Bozulich said he and Trutanich 
have contracted with a moving company to relocate the units but have yet to 
find an available site. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the developers were required by city law to pay each Southwind 
tenant between $2,000 and $5,000 in relocation assistance. They also hired 
Griffith &amp; Associates, a company that specializes in relocation, to help 
their tenants find new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Southwinds tenants learned of the developers' plans in 1987, and occupancy at 
the complex has dwindled since then. About 100 apartments were occupied when 
eviction notices were sent out in February. 
</P>
<P>
According to Zeidman, the eviction hit especially hard at Southwinds because 
most of its former tenants are middle-class people -- too wealthy to qualify 
for government housing subsidies, but not wealthy enough to be able comfortably 
to afford San Pedro's high rents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 Qualify for Subsidies 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Penny Griffith, owner of Griffith &amp; Associates, said only five 
Southwinds tenants qualified for subsidized housing. The rest, she said, have 
had to "redo their budgets." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the buildings we deal with are rent-controlled buildings, and the 
people are used to paying relatively low rent and they really don't want to pay 
much more than that," Griffith said. "The realities are that to move, they'll 
have to pay more rent." 
</P>
<P>
Some former Southwinds tenants are now paying double or triple what they 
previously paid. 
</P>
<P>
One former tenant, who did not want to be named, said she paid $300 for a 
three-bedroom apartment at Southwinds and is now paying $600 for a one-bedroom 
unit elsewhere in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be rich or you have to be on welfare," she complained. "If you are 
a middle-class person in San Pedro, you have no home, or you have to work two 
jobs to find a place." 
</P>
<P>
Another former resident, Lorraine Patalano, said she paid $362 a month for a 
three-bedroom unit at Southwinds and is now paying nearly triple that amount 
for a three-bedroom apartment elsewhere in San Pedro. Patalano, who had lived 
at Southwinds for 16 years, said she splits the rent for her new apartment with 
two of her children. 
</P>
<P>
But for Patalano and other longtime Southwinds residents, the eviction meant 
more than the loss of an affordable apartment. It also meant the breakup of the 
Southwinds community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been real tough," said Christine Virgason, who was among the last to 
move. "A lot of people have lived here for 20 years, and raised families. . . . 
It used to be teeming with people, little kids all over the place. It was just 
a nice, family-oriented place."

ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE ANGERS ELDERLY VICTIMS; 
</P>
<P>
MAN GUILTY OF MULTIPLE RAPES GETS 44 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 37-year-old Sepulveda man who raped three elderly and middle-aged women was 
sentenced Thursday to 44 years in prison, a term that angered victims because 
he could be eligible for parole in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Anthony Roy pleaded guilty May 10 to three counts of rape and one count 
of assault with intent to rape. The attacks, two of which occurred in 
retirement homes, took place during a three-month crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
Roy was originally charged with 19 felony counts in connection with those 
attacks and three other incidents. Under a plea-bargain arrangement, he was 
allowed to plead guilty to four counts, and all others were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
At his sentencing hearing in San Fernando Superior Court, two of the rape 
victims testified that Roy deserves harsher punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have been raped again and society has been raped," a 62-year-old 
Chatsworth widow said after Roy was sentenced by Judge John H. Major. She said 
Roy should have been tried on all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy. Dist. Atty. Robert Nishinaka said that even if there had been a trial 
on all the charges, Roy probably would not have been convicted of them all and 
that the sentence would not have been significantly lengthened. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a reasonable disposition of the case," Nishinaka said. "Forty-four 
years in prison is no walk in the park." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the other cases, Roy allegedly broke into Northridge Gardens 
Retirement Center and stole a knife from a 67-year old man. In the two others, 
he allegedly was lurking outside the apartments of a 79-year-old woman and a 
76-year-old woman. In connection with those incidents, Roy was charged with 
residential burglary, attempted burglary, attempted rape, theft, prowling and 
other minor charges. 
</P>
<P>
Nishinaka said he believed that the two victims not present in court Thursday 
would have had difficulty testifying in a trial. One of those was a 73-year-old 
woman who was raped in January, 1988, in her room at the Northridge retirement 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The other woman, 72, a resident of Los Angeles Housing for the Elderly in 
Woodland Hills, was beaten until she was bloody. Roy was accused of making 
sexual advances but fleeing after she screamed for help. Though they both 
testified at Roy's preliminary hearing, Nishinaka said he did not know if those 
two women could withstand a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 62-year-old woman said she felt her rights had been trampled on. 
</P>
<P>
"They promised that there wouldn't be any plea bargains, and they didn't 
consult with victims before they let him plead," the Chatsworth woman said. She 
noted that Roy could be paroled after serving just 18 years, while in his 
mid-50s. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone in their 50s is impotent," she said. "He could still rape again." 
</P>
<P>
The woman also said police could have prevented one of the other rapes. On 
March 11, 1988, she said, Roy, who wanted to have an ongoing relationship with 
her after he raped her, contacted her at her home and asked her to meet him at 
the intersection of Sepulveda and Roscoe boulevards. She notified authorities, 
but they did not pick him up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night, Roy broke into the home of a 50-year-old Burbank woman and 
raped her at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to God we could have put him away forever," said the Burbank woman, now 
52. "There is no way he is going away as long as he should have." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said that her life has been permanently altered by the attack, and 
that she is no longer as independent as she once was. She is terrified to stay 
in the house alone and is too frightened to take vacations in unfamiliar 
places, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth woman also said that she is skittish and jumpy all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an unbelievable trauma. It is like being shellshocked in a war," she 
said. "Nobody really understands the trauma until they have been through it. It 
leaves you a wreck for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Roy was arrested in April, 1988, after his fingerprints were matched with those 
found in the Chatsworth woman's home. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Roy, whose criminal history includes convictions 
for car theft, robbery and battery, has heard voices from the time he was an 
adolescent. He heard these voices, he said, before and after attacks on the 
women.

SANTA CLARITA, WATER BOARD TO DISCUSS LAND DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council and directors of the Castaic Lake Water Agency 
will hold a joint meeting Wednesday to plan a joint purchase of the 520-acre 
Saugus Rehabilitation Center, a defunct alcoholic rehabilitation farm owned by 
the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita wants the property for a city hall, park and perhaps an arts 
complex. The water agency wants 65 to 80 acres to build a plant to filter 
drinking water for the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Water agency directors agreed to the meeting Wednesday night after a 
presentation by Councilmen Carl Boyer III and Dennis Koontz. 
</P>
<P>
The closed meeting will be held in the water agency's boardroom at 23560 Lyons 
Ave. at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said the council and water agency will discuss the possibility of making 
Los Angeles an offer on the property. Robert C. Sagehorn, water agency general 
manager, said Thursday that the agency is still waiting for Los Angeles 
officials to release a long-awaited appraisal of the Saugus property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Phase 
</P>
<P>
The proposed treatment plant is the focal point of a $230-million project to 
improve and expand water agency facilities through 2010, Sagehorn said. The 
agency hopes to have the initial phase of the treatment plant operating by 
1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Saugus Rehabilitation Center has been the subject of speculation recently 
because it could play a role in a proposed land swap aimed at preserving 
Elsmere Canyon, just southeast of Santa Clarita, as a dump site. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members have repeatedly denied rumors that they will not oppose a 
dump in Elsmere in exchange for the former alcoholic rehabilitation farm. "It 
would appear to me that there are rumors out in the community not at all based 
on fact," Boyer said at Tuesday night's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles wants to open a dump in Elsmere. The council has not 
taken a formal position on plans by BKK Corp. of Torrance, which also wants to 
open a dump in Elsmere Canyon by 1991. Council members have said they will wait 
until an environmental impact report is completed to comment. The report could 
be ready by early next year, company officials have said.

OFFICIALS STEP UP SEARCH FOR GYPSY MOTHS AT 5 SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent discoveries of gypsy moths have prompted stepped-up monitoring for the 
voracious leaf-eating insects in five areas of the San Fernando, Santa Clarita 
and Conejo valleys, but so far there are no indications of a general 
infestation, state and county agricultural officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The capture Aug. 4 of a single moth on Remick Avenue in Sun Valley prompted 
state agriculture officials to set out 100 additional traps in a 
four-square-mile area around the find. 
</P>
<P>
Extra traps were installed in Chatsworth and Newhall two weeks ago and in 
Thousand Oaks and Woodland Hills earlier this summer after single male moths 
were captured in each of those locations. 
</P>
<P>
But with no additional moths yet captured at any of the sites, "I'd say it 
looks very hopeful," said Jim Wiseman, supervising agricultural inspector with 
the Los Angeles County agricultural commissioner's office. "Usually, if there 
were an infestation, one would find additional male moths within a short period 
of time . . . probably within a matter of days." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the last gypsy moth infestation occurred in Encino in 1987 when 
chemical and bacterial pesticides were used to kill young gypsy moth 
caterpillars. 
</P>
<P>
Gypsy moths, native to Europe, were inadvertently introduced into the eastern 
United States, and are brought here from the East on recreational vehicles, 
swing sets, picnic tables and similar outdoor articles. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not particularly fussy about where they go into the cocoon stage or 
where the female lays her eggs, and she may lay her eggs on a rock . . . or the 
wheel of a lawn mower or the side of a doghouse," Wiseman said. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when people from the East move here and bring these outdoor items with 
them, they may be carrying gypsy moth egg masses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henry, chief of the pest detection-emergency projects branch of the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture, said the local moths are among 53 that were 
captured statewide this spring and summer. He said some chemical treatment will 
be used in an area of Marin County, where 18 of the moths have been found. 
</P>
<P>
County agriculture officials routinely maintain three gypsy moth traps per 
square mile. The traps are baited with a sexual pheromone exuded by female 
moths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 Traps in Area 
</P>
<P>
When a male moth is caught, the state Department of Food and Agriculture 
blankets the area with 100 traps -- installing 25 traps per square mile in the 
four square miles surrounding the find. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Sun Valley capture, single male moths were found the last week of 
July near Devonshire Street and Valley Circle Boulevard in Chatsworth and near 
San Fernando Road and Lyons Avenue in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
Once in June and again in July, single moths were trapped in Thousand Oaks, 
officials said. Also in June, a moth was caught in Woodland Hills near the 
intersection of Mulholland Drive and Old Topanga Canyon Road.

DRIVER BURNED TO DEATH, 4 HURT IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man burned to death in a five-car pileup Thursday morning that 
injured four other motorists and closed the southbound Golden State Freeway in 
Valencia for nearly two hours, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Tahmas Tahmassebian, 42, died in the 12:05 a.m. accident in the southbound 
lanes of the freeway near the Lyons Avenue exit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the accident occurred when Tahmassebian, driving south, lost 
control of his Mercedes-Benz and crashed into the freeway's center divider. 
About two minutes earlier, a motorist with a car phone had called the CHP and 
reported that the Mercedes was weaving across lanes of the freeway, the CHP 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Car Rebounded 
</P>
<P>
After hitting the center divider, the Mercedes rebounded into the second lane 
of the freeway and came to a stop, Officer Ralph Elvira said. Two other 
southbound cars swerved around it and also stopped, he said. Another car could 
not stop in time and attempted to pass between the stopped cars but hit all 
three, knocking one of them into a passing pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars were going all over the place," Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes burst into flames and Tahmassebian apparently burned to death, 
Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
All southbound lanes of the freeway were closed while the fire was extinguished 
and the wreckage was cleared. Elvira said traffic backed up two miles before 
the freeway was reopened about 90 minutes after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Three drivers and a passenger from the other cars involved in the accident were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Weeks, 25, of Fresno was in critical condition at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Newhall, and Jerry Gragnani, 40, of Fresno was in stable 
condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnani's passenger, Anna Sandoval, 34, of Fresno was treated and released at 
Holy Cross. Francisco Gutierrez, 49, of San Fernando was treated at Henry Mayo 
Newhall for minor injuries, officials said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG MEMBER GETS 31 YEARS TO LIFE IN 'SWEET 16' 
PARTY SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old Lake View Terrace gang member was sentenced Thursday to 31 years 
to life in prison for the murder of the chaperon at a "sweet 16" party. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen imposed the sentence on Jeffrey 
Evans, 24, after denying his lawyer's motion for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and John Tanner, 23, also of Lake View Terrace, were convicted last month 
of murdering John Shaw, 23, who was shot to death on the front lawn of a house 
in Sylmar where the party was being held. Tanner is to be sentenced today. 
</P>
<P>
During the eight-week trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison argued that 
Tanner, Evans, and Dennis Elliot, 24, of Pacoima, approached Shaw as he stood 
with other guests in front of the home in the 14900 block of Aztec Street. 
Evans was said to have asked the party-goers if they were affiliated with 
gangs. Shaw replied that he was not. Tanner interpreted that as a slight and 
shot Shaw in the back, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Elliot was acquitted of the murder charges. However the jury found him guilty 
of attempted murder for his role in a drive-by shooting earlier that night. 
Four shots were fired at Cedric Finley, 20, of Pacoima. Finley was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Coen sentenced Elliot on Thursday to 15 years in state prison. Lawyers for 
Evans and Elliot said they will seek a new trial, claiming that their clients 
were convicted on insufficient evidence.

RANCHO P.V. TO HOLD HEARINGS ON COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has announced that it will hold public 
hearings on environmental impact reports for separate developments planned for 
its coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the hearings is to get the council involved earlier in the 
development process, Mayor Jacki Bacharach said at a meeting this week. 
Previous development plans have been refined by the city staff and the Planning 
Commission before reaching the council. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal development has become the major issue in Rancho Palos Verdes and will 
play a key role this fall when two council seats are up for election. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Monday, several speakers criticized a proposal for a municipal 
golf course near Point Vicente, saying the city should find ways to preserve 
open space rather than provide golf courses for nearby home and hotel projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmental Studies 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the golf course, the development proposals -- which are in 
various stages of completion -- include two luxury hotels and two large 
residential projects totaling 253 homes. Officials said environmental studies 
will be available in the fall. Hearings on the studies, as well as on the 
specific development plans, will stretch into next year. 
</P>
<P>
While the meeting touched on all coastal development, the golf course drew the 
most attention with questions about such things as public access to the 
coastline and whether the state Coastal Commission would permit it.

City Atty. Ariel Calonne said the National Park Service has been "cooperative 
and encouraging" about the golf course. The Park Service must approve the golf 
course since some of it would be on federal land donated to the city and the 
federal agency wants to ensure public use and access. 
</P>
<P>
The golf course would be built by the city, in conjunction with Monaghan Co., 
which is planning a resort hotel at the former Marineland site, and VMS/Anden, 
which is proposing 96 homes near Point Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study done for the city proposes that the hotel be entitled to 
one-third of the course playing time. Hotel guests would pay higher fees than 
residents.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSFORMER EXPLODES, SLOWS HIGHWAY TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An electrical transformer exploded in Newhall Thursday, leaving 2,500 customers 
without power and snarling rush-hour traffic for more than an hour, the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the 5 p.m. explosion at Placerita Canyon Road and Sierra 
Highway, Sgt. Tom Davidheiser said. Cars were backed up for more than two miles 
along Sierra Highway while deputies directed traffic because traffic signals 
lost power, Davidheiser said. 
</P>
<P>
Power was restored about 6 p.m., said Rosalie Gnam, Santa Clarita Valley area 
manager for the Southern California Edison Co. The explosion was apparently 
caused by a bird that flew into the pole-mounted transformer, she said.

RESEDA EXTENSION TO MULHOLLAND DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reseda does not want Reseda Boulevard connected to Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
It wants to keep commuter traffic out, and it fears that the unpaved portion of 
Mulholland will eventually be paved, succumbing to ever-increasing traffic 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Encino wants Reseda Boulevard paved to alleviate its own horrendous 
cross-mountain traffic and demands that Reseda share the burden of city 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Our Hollywood Hills community is fighting the proposed Mulholland Plan as it 
will attract a projected 5,000 tourists' cars every day in addition to the 
90,000 that cross at Laurel, Coldwater and Beverly Glen canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all three communities want the mountains to remain scenic, rural and free 
of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The planners address the problem piecemeal, shifting the problem from the 
loudest to the more laid-back communities under pressure from the politicians 
who seek slogans for their campaigns with good-sounding "solutions" for the 
naive. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains are in desperate need of a comprehensive, regional 
traffic plan with imaginative and real solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Now that communities are fighting each other for environmental quality as if it 
were food in days of hunger, people may finally realize that times are 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
We are heading toward irreversible disaster unless the politicians and planners 
can show us the leadership and visionary planning.

BOMB THREAT A FALSE ALARM; MAN ARRESTED ON CENTER'S ROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city-operated family counseling center in Reseda that police were mistakenly 
told was an abortion clinic was closed and nearby streets were blocked off for 
two hours Thursday because authorities thought a bomb might have been placed on 
its roof. 
</P>
<P>
But after a man seen prowling on the roof of the Family Service of Los Angeles 
Community Center in the 17400 block of Victory Boulevard was arrested, the bomb 
squad moved in and discovered the suspected bomb was actually a battery pack 
and radio device used to control a model car. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Fugere, 20, of Encino was arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary 
after he could not explain what he was doing on top of the one-story center 
with the equipment, Lt. George Rock said. He was held in lieu of $2,500 bail at 
West Valley jail. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 7 a.m. when passers-by noticed Fugere on the roof of 
the center, which is operated by the Department of Recreation and Parks. 
Possibly because a sign in front of the center advertises family counseling, 
one caller mistakenly told police that the center was an abortion clinic, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shoulder Bag 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Winthrop Taylor said that officers who found Fugere on the roof saw a 
shoulder bag containing the battery pack and radio device with wire protruding 
from it. They asked the bomb squad to examine the device. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at it and it looked like what you see on television" when programs 
show explosive devices, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The block of Victory Boulevard in front of the center was closed off, but the 
bomb squad later determined there was no threat. 
</P>
<P>
Center director Fran Umanski said the center has nothing to do with abortion. 
"We have no controversial programs here," she said. "We have nothing to do with 
abortion, pro or con." 
</P>
<P>
Rock said investigators found the model car in Fugere's auto that went with the 
battery and radio controller.

TORAN'S BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL IS PUT AT THREE TIMES LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raider safety Stacey Toran had a blood-alcohol level more than three times the 
legal limit when he drove his car into a tree and was killed, the coroner's 
office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the toxicological examination put Toran's blood alcohol level at 
.32 percent when he was killed shortly before midnight last Saturday, county 
coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the legal limit at which a person is considered to be driving 
under the influence of alcohol is .10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only drug found in his system," Dambacher said. "Everything else 
proved negative." 
</P>
<P>
To reach a blood alcohol level of .32 percent, a 154-pound person would have to 
quickly drink 10 bottles of beer or 10 ounces of whiskey, according to the 
American Medical Association's "Family Medical Guide." 
</P>
<P>
Toran weighed about 200 pounds, so he presumably would have had to have 
consumed more alcohol to reach the .32 percent level. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow, that's getting almost to the unconscious level," said Dr. Ernest Noble, 
professor of alcohol studies at UCLA. "For a guy who weighs that much . . . to 
get to the .32 level, that would be approximately 16 drinks" within 30 minutes 
to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, when they reach that level, pass out," Noble said. "This poor 
fellow must have been extremely out (of it) when he was driving. In my 
experience, I've rarely seen people hit that high of a level. . . . Obviously 
he could start the car, but as far as control, he was completely out of whack." 
</P>
<P>
Noble said that a .40 percent level usually causes death by alcohol poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Toran, 27, died of "multiple head and chest injuries," according to the 
preliminary post-mortem autopsy report. He was killed after he lost control of 
his 1984 BMW on a curve one block from his home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Toran was thrown from his car after the vehicle struck a tree and flipped 
several times. Police said his head struck the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Townsend, who roomed with Toran at the Raiders' training camp, said he 
knew his teammate as a careful driver who always wore a seat belt. But police 
said Toran was driving without wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
Toran, who attended Notre Dame, was drafted by the Raiders in the sixth round 
in 1984. He became the starting strong safety the next year and remained a 
starter until last year, when he was plagued by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He played in 12 of the Raiders' 16 games last season, starting four. He was 
listed as a first-stringer this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Toran will be buried Friday in his hometown of Indianapolis. A memorial service 
was held for him at the Maranatha Community Church in Los Angeles Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his mother, Christine; his father, I.V.; two sisters, 10 
brothers and his fiancee, Sherry L. Calhoun.

The population of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip has grown by 6,500 over last year's figures, despite the 20-month-old 
Palestinian uprising, the government said. The figures, released by the 
government-run Central Bureau of Statistics, show that Jewish settlements grew 
almost 400% more than Jerusalem, the second-fastest growing area. The bureau 
reported that 66,500 Jews lived in the occupied territories in late 1988, an 
increase of 10.3% over 1987. Settler leaders attributed the continued growth to 
right-wing activists moving to the occupied lands in a show of Jewish resolve 
to hold onto the disputed lands. However, in 1986, the year before the 
uprising, the settler population increased by 15.8%, the bureau said.

China's Communist Party expelled the country's leading computer entrepreneur 
for having supported the spring pro-democracy protest. Wan Runnan, whose 
company, the Stone Group Co., was nicknamed the IBM of China, was ousted from 
the party and fired as Stone chairman and president. He fled China after the 
June 3-4 crackdown. Meanwhile, police in the southern city of Canton confirmed 
the arrest of Zheng Xuguang, of the Beijing Space and Aeronautics University, 
bringing to seven the number of student leaders arrested out of a national list 
of 21.

Salvatore (Bill) Bonnano, who claimed three months ago to be too poor to pay 
his lawyer, managed to come up with $72,500 last October to pay for his 
daughter's wedding, according to court documents. Bonnano, the son of reputed 
mobster Joseph (Joe Bananas) Bonnano, was sentenced in 1987 to four years in 
prison after his conviction on charges of conspiracy to commit grand theft. He 
has been free since then on $50,000 bail pending an appeal. Deputy California 
Atty. Gen. Derald Grandberg, who has been fighting to put Salvatore Bonnano 
behind bars, filed documents in Alameda County Superior Court indicating the 
wedding featured a 14-piece orchestra and a menu that included shrimp and filet 
mignon. Earlier this year, after pleading that he was indigent, Bonnano was 
awarded $19,250 in public funds to pay his lawyer.

<TEXT>

Taxpayers paid 7% more in state taxes in fiscal 1988 than they did in the 
previous year, the government reported. The Commerce Department reported that 
state tax revenues totaled $264 billion in the year ending June 30, 1988, 
compared to $246 billion in the previous fiscal year. California had the 
largest total state tax revenue, $36 billion, up 6% from the previous year. 
California taxes averaged $1,281 per capita, slightly over the national average 
of $1,077. The other large state tax revenues in fiscal 1988 were: New York, 
$26 billion; Texas, $13 billion; Pennsylvania, $12 billion; Illinois, Michigan 
and Florida, $11 billion each; and Ohio, $10 billion. Tax collections in these 
eight states totaled nearly half of the taxes collected nationally.

Five people accused of working to develop anti-helicopter missiles for the 
Irish Republican Army were indicted in Boston on federal charges of conspiring 
to violate regulations on arms exports. Investigators say the five, including a 
computer scientist, were working for the Provisional IRA, the guerrilla wing of 
the nationalist group fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland. 
Following the arrests of three of the defendants in July, the FBI seized radar 
and missile parts "in various stages of development or manufacture" during 
raids in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, according to FBI agent 
James F. Ahearn.

22 KILLED IN BEIRUT SHELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

At least 22 people were killed and 140 wounded as Syrian and Christian forces 
clashed in eight hours of artillery duels in Beirut, officials announced. 
Shells hit the hilltop residence of U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy in Yarze, a 
Christian suburb of the besieged capital, as well as the residence of French 
Ambassador Rene Ala in the suburb of Hazmiye, but police said no one was hurt. 
The day's casualties raised the toll to 571 dead and 1,462 wounded, by police 
count, since the artillery war began in mid-March. Many of the latest victims 
were caught in the streets as they tried to take advantage of a three-day lull 
in what is only the latest round in Lebanon's 14-year civil war.

President Sibghatullah Mojaddidi of the Afghan rebels' self-proclaimed 
government-in-exile branded his own foreign minister, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a 
"killer" of innocent Afghans and other guerrillas. Mojaddidi said his regime 
would have a better chance of survival without Hekmatyar, leader of the 
powerful Hezb-i-Islami resistance group. "He considers himself the hero of the 
jihad (holy war), but in fact . . . he has killed hundreds of (guerrillas) 
inside Afghanistan and hundreds of innocent people inside Afghanistan," 
Mojaddidi said in an interview.

SURFERS RIDE THE WAVES IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL FEINEMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While everybody else wears neon to the beach this summer, most pro surfers say 
the look is too mainstream for their taste. They only allow for it in contests, 
where it gives them greater visibility than the classic, all-black suits they 
still prefer. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why there were so many flourescent-tipped wet suits at the Op Pro 
Surfing Championship at Huntington Beach last week. 
</P>
<P>
As for the shape of the suits, they were anything but the traditional long-john 
style with full-length sleeves and legs that hamper mobility. Those who opted 
for wet suits at all chose the lightest-weight versions, with knee-length legs 
and short sleeves, or no sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
A number of the pros have given up wet suits altogether, at least for the hot 
summer months. They competed wearing shorts and tops made of a 
Lycra-and-Neoprene blend, in styles that could pass for cyclists' wear. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Pacific's Hydro-Light label is one version of the look. The clothes hug 
the body so well, surfers say wearing them is like swimming naked. 
</P>
<P>
Along with fluorescent color, colored zinc oxide sun block for the nose is on 
the out list this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest fashion error of them all, says Todd Chesser, a pro surfer from 
Hawaii, is not peeling your wet suit off as soon as you get out of the water. 
"Wearing it too long is like coming to the beach in your business suit," he 
laughs. "It just isn't done." NEIL FEINEMAN

"So tell me, Sheila, your piece in Calendar today on 'Milk and Honey,' is it a 
typical, well-thought-out, well-written Sheila Benson movie review?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is." 
</P>
<P>
"Reads well, does it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Very well." 
</P>
<P>
"And some of the descriptions you use?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well intentioned . . . well acted . . . falls apart before its midpoint . . . 
atrocious upbeat ending in Jamaica." 
</P>
<P>
"Those are excellent descriptions to use. And the review's length?" 
</P>
<P>
"About 18 inches." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I see. Not only a good read, but a short one. And that's on Page 15 of 
today's Calendar section?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Page 15." 
</P>
<P>
"And you recommend that we all read your review?" 
</P>
<P>
"Very much so." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, always good reading you, pal. That's Page 15 today? We'll look for you 
in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
"You, too." 
</P>
<P>
If television devoted as much time to self-examination as self-promotion, its 
level of performance would improve dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Consider. If my above imaginary conversation with Times Film Critic Sheila 
Benson typically reflected even a small segment of newspaper content, most 
readers would revolt, after first falling apart with laughter over our 
pitifully transparent attempt to advertise and celebrate ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
But television -- like the chest-puffing politician who never stops running for 
office -- gets away with its behavior because it has spent years shaping 
different expectations, accustoming us to its excesses. Just as we say, "Oh, 
well, that's politics," we also say, "Oh, well, that's television." 
</P>
<P>
It's true that the Big Three networks are widening their promotional horizons 
to combat the ever-growing challenge from cable and videos. That does not mean, 
however, that they've abandoned making some promos the old-fashioned, deceptive 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Take Wednesday morning, for example. Take it and shove it. 
</P>
<P>
Here was an NBC "Today" show exclusive, the biggest out-and-out scoop since 
then-KNXT Channel 2 news in Los Angeles covered the 1981 wedding of its own top 
sportscaster at that time, Jim Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, "Today" could boast that no one else -- including its main competitors 
"Good Morning America" on ABC and "CBS News This Morning" -- had an interview 
with Maria Shriver about her documentary, "Fatal Addictions," which was airing 
that very night. 
</P>
<P>
That's Maria Shriver of NBC. That's "Fatal Addictions" on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
For much of TV, the addiction is self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The "Today" piece began with a lengthy clip from the documentary, followed by 
Bryant Gumbel's questioning of Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we gonna have some success stories tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"Success stories . . . and a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Gumbel ended it. 
</P>
<P>
"Always good seeing you, pal. Ten o'clock tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
You could live with this were "Today" also open to reporting about 
documentaries on opposing networks on the days they air. But don't hold your 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
It's no big flash, unfortunately, when news programs (the "Today" show is 
produced by NBC's news division) present self-promotion as news -- witness what 
happens on network morning shows and many local newscasts in ratings sweeps 
months. But it should be a big flash because it's a journalistic sell-out, a 
winking at ethics, a self-serving suspension of news standards. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, what occurs is a matter of an entertainment division having its 
will imposed on a news division. In Wednesday's case, it was a news division 
using itself to promote itself and one of its own: not only the documentary, 
but indirectly also the series Shriver stars on, "Sunday Today" and the new 
"Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Never has there been a medium so incestuously promotional as television. So it 
seemed almost routine to hear anchor Morton Dean end a news segment on 
Thursday's "Good Morning America" by vowing that an investigative story on the 
new ABC News series "PrimeTime Live" that night "should shock you." 
</P>
<P>
And in a space of about five minutes Wednesday morning, moreover, NBC viewers 
got a dose not only of Shriver, but also a KNBC Channel 4 news promo ("We get 
around . . ."), a promo applauding "L.A. Law's" Emmy nominations and a Maxwell 
House coffee commercial starring Linda Ellerbee and ever-mugging "Today" 
weathercaster Willard Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Running this commercial within the "Today" time period risks the possibility of 
some viewers confusing the clowning Maxwell House Willard with the clowning 
"Today" Willard, a mix-up that NBC seems almost to be encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
But not its competitors. "Good Morning America" and "CBS This Morning" are 
running another version of the Maxwell House spot, one featuring only Ellerbee. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "CBS This Morning" came up with a curious piece of its own 
Wednesday: Kathleen Sullivan interviewed the show's health specialist, Dr. 
Robert Arnot, and a woman named Nancy Hicks, who had nearly drowned in a 
river-rafting accident observed by Arnot while taping a "CBS This Morning" 
segment on rafting. 
</P>
<P>
How is it that this obscure incident became a story on "CBS This Morning"? 
Because the show had footage of Arnot helping others revive Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
Would this have made the "CBS This Morning" lineup had the footage showed NBC's 
Shriver helping save Hicks? No. In that case you would have seen it on the 
"Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
Always good seeing you, pal.

U.S. HARD ROCK READY TO ROLL IN THE U.S.S.R. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The massive official name of the Saturday-Sunday rock spectacular at 
75,000-capacity Lenin Stadium here is the Moscow Music Peace Festival. 
</P>
<P>
But several of the organizers and musicians have another name for the most 
ambitious Western rock event ever staged in a country where the American-bred 
music was once denounced as bourgeois decadence. 
</P>
<P>
Their name: the Russian Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Belov, lead guitarist for the Soviet rock band Gorky Park, likes the ring 
of the term. But Belov, whose band will be on the bill with such Western acts 
as Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue, believes that the connection with 
Woodstock is more than simply a convenient media term on a weekend that happens 
to be the 20th anniversary of that landmark U.S. rock event. 
</P>
<P>
Belov says the Moscow concerts may come to represent the same revolutionary 
turning point in this country's rock development as those three days and nights 
on Max Yasgur's farm had on rock in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
Despite occasional appearances here over the last 10 years by such mainstream 
pop-rock figures as Elton John and Billy Joel, Soviet officials have been 
reluctant to open the door to Western acts, especially the rebellious, 
high-energy "bad boys" who compose much of this weekend's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Belov, 31, said the government has also discouraged the development of Soviet 
bands by "forbidding" any group that was deemed unacceptable for any of a 
number of reasons, including themes. 
</P>
<P>
But all that has changed greatly in the age of glasnost, the guitarist said 
Thursday as his band walked in a light drizzle from the Ukrainia Hotel to the 
van for the ride to the stadium for an afternoon sound check. Not only are 
there signs of greater flexibility in allowing foreign bands to play here, but 
Soviet bands are also being given increasing freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Grebenshikov, a veteran singer-songwriter who has been called the Bob 
Dylan of the Soviet Union, has recently made an album produced by British 
rocker Dave Stewart for Columbia Records and is now on a U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Belov's Gorky Park, a harder-rocking group whose sound has been likened to that 
of '60s power trio Cream, is something of a Soviet supergroup, formed two years 
ago by the leading musicians from several competing bands. 
</P>
<P>
The group has spent much of the last six months in the United States and Canada 
recording an album due soon from PolyGram Records. Belov said that most Soviet 
bands are "too inexperienced" to mount a serious challenge against Western 
groups, but feels the loosening of restrictions will change that. Seeing 
Western bands this weekend should inspire more young Soviets to start dreaming 
their own rock dreams -- a difficult, nearly impossible dream for many until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, our music scene is just beginning because it was held back for 
so long," said Belov, who was once in a band that was declared "forbidden." But 
he added proudly: "There has been a new government attitude the last three 
years and this concert should give our bands confidence and inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Doc McGhee, who manages several of the bands on the weekend bill including Bon 
Jovi and Motley Crue, also likes the "Russian Woodstock" image, but for 
different reasons. McGhee, 38, hopes that the shows' anti-drug message will 
erase much of the Woodstock legacy of permissive drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"The musical aspect of Woodstock was very important, but there were some sad 
consequences of the social aspects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The message many people came away from Woodstock with was that drugs were OK, 
even a necessary part of the rock 'n' roll experience. A lot of lives have been 
lost because of that over the last 20 years, and we are trying in these 
concerts to say that drugs don't have to be part of rock. You can still have 
fun and you can still be rebellious without drugs -- and the bonus is you will 
have a better chance of living." 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said the concerts are designed to raise money for and promote the goals 
of the Make a Difference Foundation, which he started last year with a $250,000 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to raise between $6 million and $10 million from the festival and 
such related events as a pay-per-view telecast in the United States (5 to 9 
p.m. Sunday in Southern California), a syndicated radio broadcast (on KQLZ-FM 
(100.3) in Los Angeles) and an album. Rather than simply featuring songs from 
the festival, the album will feature new studio versions of songs by artists 
who were drug casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the shows were $15 to $22 -- high by local concert standards, some 
teen-age rock fans said Thursday. But, they quickly added, "there has never 
been anything like this," so it is difficult to compare. At any rate, the shows 
are sold out and dozens of fans hung around the hotel most of the day, taking 
photos of the musicians and getting autographs. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee, who has offices in Los Angeles and New York, started the Make a 
Difference Foundation last year as part of a community service provision on 
probation given him after he pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to "aiding 
and abetting" in the distribution of an estimated 40,000 pounds of marijuana in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The manager said he has experimented with drugs but had sworn off them long 
before last year's court action and was involved in anti-drug campaigns before 
the community service order. 
</P>
<P>
Several musicians on the bill, including Jon Bon Jovi, Osbourne and Vince Neil 
of Motley Crue, have also acknowledged drug or alcohol use, but now say that it 
is in their past and warn young people about its dangers. 
</P>
<P>
The bands landed here late Wednesday after a flight on the "Magic Bus," a 
chartered 757 that left Newark, N.J., and stopped near London to pick up 
additional passengers. In keeping with the concerts' theme, no alcohol was 
served on the plane and there was no apparent drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The latter observation was confirmed -- perhaps unexpectedly -- when uniformed 
officials brought a dog on board during the 45-minute stopover in Britain. Most 
of the estimated 175 passengers were off the plane while the dog roamed the 
aisles, stopping here and there to sniff the area. 
</P>
<P>
But some members of the tour party saw the dog enter the plane and, even with 
the drug-free policy, at least one member of the group became momentarily 
anxious. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought was, 'Oh my God, are they going to find anything?,' " the 
tour member said. "Then I realized I had flashed on the old days when a dog on 
a plane could have been a disaster. I guess times really do change." 
</P>
<P>
After a press conference at the airport in Moscow, the musicians were taken on 
a brief tour of the city, stopping only for a glimpse of giant Lenin Stadium, 
scene of many of the activities in the 1980 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The band members -- many in their unmistakable hard-rock attire -- caused a 
flurry of interest among tourists when buses stopped to let them view the 
stadium from a scenic point near the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Various American and European tourists who had been shooting pictures of the 
landscape suddenly turned and began snapping photos of the visiting musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of these bands don't have as much of a profile with the non-rock 
audience as mass-media stars like Mick Jagger or David Bowie, the tourists 
scrambled about asking members of the tour party just whom they were taking 
pictures of. 
</P>
<P>
Informed that the tall fellow with the row of tattoos was a member of Motley 
Crue, a woman from Indiana all but gasped. "I made my son throw away some of 
their posters. I couldn't stand looking at them in his room. What are they 
doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
Most surprised, however, were the local residents who happened to be in the 
area. Though punk touches -- rainbow-colored hair, an occasional Mohawk, 
leather jackets with skull and crossbones, biker boots -- can sometimes be seen 
here, seeing all these bands together was something of a culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are these people?" one local woman asked in halting English. She didn't 
show any signs of recognition of the visiting bands, but a mention of Gorky 
Park did cause a reaction. It wasn't that she had heard of the Soviet band. She 
thought the American visitor was asking how to get to the real Gorky Park, a 
combination recreation area and theater zone similar to Griffith Park in Los 
Angeles. After a brief huddle in Russian with her husband, she started pointing 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting back on the bus for the ride to the hotel, a member of the New 
Jersey-based band Skid Row band showed that even on a drug-free journey there 
is room for some old-fashioned rock tomfoolery. As he neared the bus, singer 
Sebastian Bach lowered his pants and mooned the crowd of onlookers, including a 
pair of Moscow policemen sitting in a parked squad car. 
</P>
<P>
One woman put one hand over her eyes and pulled her young daughter away. The 
Moscow police? They just seemed to shake their heads in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
How did this rambunctious bunch ever get into the Soviet Union? Driving force 
McGhee said that his stress on the anti-drug message was a key, because drug 
and alcohol abuse is a growing problem in the Soviet Union. The word peace in 
the title also made it more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it wasn't easy. McGhee made nine trips to the Soviet Union to set it up 
and had to deal with several government agencies. He was aided by Soviet 
musician Stas Namin, whose grandfather was formerly a high Communist Party 
official. McGhee also introduced the Soviet officials to Jon Bon Jovi, the most 
diplomatic and acceptable-looking member of the rock roster. McGhee didn't 
detail the background of all the other acts, especially Ozzy Osbourne, who 
seems to attract controversy -- he has been accused of everything from 
advocating satanism to inspiring suicide to intentionally biting the head off a 
dead bat (he did do the last, but it was an accident). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Western concert organizers speculated that the concerts may be 
another gamble by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his continuing effort 
to sustain the glasnost spirit and renew the spirits of disaffected youth. They 
believe that Soviet officials will be watching the shows closely to see what 
happens when they ease up after repressing rock for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but think what happens here this weekend is going to be pretty 
historic," Jon Bon Jovi said seriously. Then, referring to the weekend's 
biggest example of culture shock, he quipped, "I imagine Mr. Bush and Mr. 
Gorbachev are both going to be aware of who Ozzy Osbourne is."

WARNER'S WILD CARD; 
</P>
<P>
NO MATTER HOW YOU COUNT, 'BATMAN'S' PAYOFF IS NO JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Just how big is "Batman"? 
</P>
<P>
 Dazzled by the first $200 million-plus film to hit the box office since 
Universal's "Back to the Future" in 1985, numbers crunchers from Wall Street to 
Hollywood are pounding their calculators over Warner Bros.' latest blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the gorilla. . . . They're going to make a fortune," said one envious 
competitor, after doing some quick math that shows Warner might sell $130 
million worth of "Batman" videocassettes around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Calendar decided to join the guessing game. What follows is a dual calculation 
of "Batman's" prospects, compiled with help from securities analysts, Hollywood 
agents, studio executives, and others who have been monitoring the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Caution: Neither Warner executives nor other key individuals involved with the 
film were willing to share the real numbers. Our numbers are estimates -- and, 
in some cases, plain old guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this is the movie business, moreover, you have to count twice. 
</P>
<P>
 To the right, the "Batman" numbers as they might shape up on a classic 
Hollywood profit statement sent to actors, writers and others with a stake in 
the movie. Next to those numbers is a calculation, from the Wall Street point 
of view, of income the film may bring to Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
THE HOLLYWOOD COUNT 
</P>
<P>
RECEIPTS: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Theaters. Ticket sales topped $214 million in a sizzling six weeks, and 
are sure to pass the $250-million mark, even if audiences drop sharply. When 
grosses pile up that quickly, the studio gets an unusually large share of the 
total under contracts with theater owners. Figure Warner will keep about 60%, 
or: $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Theaters. Warner is known for strong foreign sales, but "Batman" is an 
American myth, and it isn't easy to duplicate any blockbuster abroad. Also, the 
studio keeps less from foreign theaters, where "Batman" is just now opening. If 
international ticket sales hit $225 million, Warner may keep 50%, or: $112.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. videocassettes. This depends on strategy. Warner could take a 
low-price/high-volume option, flooding the market with "Batman" cassettes 
priced at $24.95 this Christmas. After costs, each cassette might bring $13 or 
more back to Warner. ("E.T.," which initially sold at that price last 
Christmas, sold a phenomenal 15 million units.) At 8 million cassettes, 
"Batman" would bring in $104 million, but only 20% of that, known as the 
"producer's gross," gets paid to the movie under common studio accounting 
procedures. Add: $20.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign cassettes. Warner is likely to take a high-price option abroad, 
selling to rental stores and other outlets for about $50 a cassette. A big 
foreign sale would be 550,000 cassettes, for $27.5 million, of which the 
producer's gross, again figured at 20%, is: $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pay TV. Time Warner Inc.'s own HBO cable service will buy "Batman" under a 
package deal signed before Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. "Witches 
of Eastwick," another Warner hit, got $13 million from its cable sale. "Batman" 
should do better, but not by much, since the HBO deal probably sets a maximum 
price for any movie, no matter how popular. Figure: $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
World TV. This market is exploding, making it tough to know where things will 
stand when Warner sells the movie in three years or so. "You're always hesitant 
to estimate somebody else's movie. But I guess ('Batman') could bring $10 
million to $12 million on the conservative side, all the way up to $25 million 
if things open up," says Bill Shields, head of the American Film Marketing 
Assn. Somewhat conservatively, let's call it: $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Free TV. Far in the future, "Batman" will probably show on a major TV network, 
and then on your local independent TV station. Those sales could bring $14 
million or so, but one film securities analyst recommended discounting the 
figure downward to a present value of roughly: $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sound-track royalty. Every time Warner sells a "Batman" record, the movie gets 
a tiny cut, probably about 3% of retail. If the album sale reaches 8 million 
(see the corporate side of the ledger), this might yield: $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Imponderables. Movies get money from the darndest places -- airplanes, hotel 
rooms, army bases, ships at sea. Let's just call it another: $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Total Receipts. $334.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
EXPENSES: 
</P>
<P>
Hard costs. This money is shelled out by the studio in cold cash, and includes 
an estimated $6 million advance to Jack Nicholson, $5 million or so for Michael 
Keaton and other actors, $1.25 million (including bonus) for director Tim 
Burton, and other production costs. Some folks say the real number is over $50 
million, but sources familiar with the movie have repeatedly pegged it at 
about: $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Studio overhead. All studios charge a percentage of hard costs to cover their 
own corporate expenses associated with a film. Fees vary, but a modest charge 
would be 15%, or: $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Prints and advertising. Higher and higher all the time, as studios rely heavily 
on prime-time TV to force-feed opening-night audiences. Including certain other 
incidentals -- taxes, dubbing, shipping, and so forth by the end of the year -- 
this line approaches: $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Distribution fee. This one's a killer. Big studios charge every movie a stiff 
percentage of revenue collected as a fee for distributing the film. The 
percentage varies from market to market -- U.S. theatrical sales may carry a 
30% fee, while foreign theater sales may cost 40%. Based on past Warner films, 
it appears that the overall fee will be about 33%, or: $110.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Joker's cut. Jack Nicholson, according to several sources familiar with the 
film, is paid a percentage of Warner's total receipts on "Batman." Supposedly, 
the cut starts at 15%, then escalates to as much as 20% as the dollars flow in. 
No joke, figured at 17.5%, Nicholson could get $58.5 million, minus his 
advance, for an additional: $52.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Comic possibility. DC Comics owns Batman, the character, and Warner owns DC. 
Sources say the unit gets 5% of the movie's receipts, from the first dollar. 
That's: $16.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other players. Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, Keaton and some others are 
said to have deals that give them a cut of the "adjusted gross," a figure that 
may be calculated differently, under complex formulas, for each contract. One 
reasonably well-informed guess figures these participants could get: $18 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Interest. An old Hollywood custom allows the studio to charge interest on its 
$40 million in hard costs at 125% of the prime rate until all the other charges 
against a film are paid off. With the prime rate hovering around 10.5%, Warner 
will collect about 13.13%, for as long as three years. That's another: $15.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Total expenses: $309.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line. Is "Batman" going to be a "profit" picture? The figures here 
suggest the movie will turn a modest net profit of $24.9 million during its 
first sale to all the various markets. Traditionally, Warner collects about 
half of that, or about $12.5 million. The rest gets divided among other profit 
participants. If, as one source suggests, director Burton gets 10% of the net, 
he will eventually see about $2.5 million.

REDONDO MAY OK FREEZE ON BUILDING NEAR HARBOR 
</P>

<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council is expected to impose a 90-day moratorium 
Tuesday on development in the North Catalina Avenue Corridor, while a 
comprehensive plan is prepared for the area at the entrance to King Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the move is necessary to forestall development that could 
conflict with longstanding plans to convert the run-down, triangular-shaped 
site into a modern commercial center that would cater to harbor visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium would block current plans by developers to build a sprawling, 
self-storage warehouse, office buildings and various stores in the 
15-square-block harbor gateway area of North Catalina Avenue between Pacific 
Coast Highway and Beryl Street. Old businesses and dilapidated houses now 
dominate much of the area, particularly the stretch south of Gertruda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning for Visitors 
</P>
<P>
Douglas N. McIsaac, a senior planner in the city's Community Development 
Department, said a plan drawn up in 1987 proposed using the Catalina corridor 
for arts and crafts shops, seafood markets, clothing and sports equipment 
stores, convention facilities, restaurants, nightclubs, outlets for clothing 
and sports equipment, and other visitor-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, McIsaac said in a report to the council this week, the 
Catalina corridor "has been recognized for its potential, with proper planning, 
(as) a specialized commercial area that would be a highly positive asset to the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
He said the corridor is a major entry route to the Redondo Pier and other 
harbor locations and, through a "commercial transformation," could provide an 
"attractive and inviting environment" that would enhance the city's image and 
boost business in the harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Tuesday, the council authorized a study of the Catalina corridor 
by Envicom Inc. at a cost of $34,720. The firm, which is also the city's 
General Plan consultant, will review the short- and long-term development 
issues and come up with an interim control ordinance by the end of the 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
If the ordinance is adopted by the council, McIsaac said, its provisions will 
be incorporated into the General Plan, which is expected to be completed by the 
end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members were reluctant to block corridor development plans that 
are already in the works and in conformance with the area's current zoning and 
other requirements. 
</P>
<P>
But the council heeded what planners termed a need for "interim measures to 
protect long-term planning interests" and voted unanimously for the 90-day 
study by Envicom. The emergency building moratorium to be voted on Tuesday 
would maintain the status quo until the study is completed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the proposed development projects on the west side of Catalina, between 
Francisca Avenue and Broadway, would utilize part of the Santa Fe Railway's 
right-of-way. The council instructed planners to look into the possibility of 
the city acquiring that portion of the strip for public use.

Congress's Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 291 to 123, the House approved a fiscal 1990 budget of $1.6 
billion for itself and congressional support agencies. That is an increase of 
14% over the comparable fiscal 1989 bill. After the Senate adds its budget of 
more than $400 million, the cost of operating the legislative branch in 1990 
will top $2 billion. Members' salaries of nearly $50 million are funded 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
Among items in the House-passed bill are $188 million for the salaries of House 
members' personal staffs (up 5% from the comparable 1989 figure), $118 million 
for committee operations including staff salaries (up 7%) and $123 million for 
House members' and senators' free-mail privileges. The postage sum is 
open-ended and likely to be increased, despite new language reducing from six 
to four the number of mass mailings House members can send to constituents each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Cutting Congress's Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 167 to 246, the House rejected an amendment cutting nearly all 
areas of the 1990 legislative branch budget (above) by 6.25%, for a savings of 
$97 million. "What used to be called the '$1-billion Congress' has become the 
'$2-billion Congress,' " said amendment sponsor Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) Opponent 
Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) said the amendment "would cut some items that are very 
fundamental in terms of the members' ability to work around this place." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a 6.25% cut in the fiscal 1990 legislative branch 
budget.

Debt Limit

The House voted 231 to 185 to raise the national debt ceiling by $70 billion to 
about $2.87 trillion. The new limit, which was sent to the Senate, will enable 
the government to pay its bills while awaiting congressional approval of a 
separate measure putting the federal borrowing limit at $3.123 trillion.

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 206 to 219, the House refused to further restrict abortion in the 
District of Columbia. The defeated amendment sought to renew a ban on the 
district using its own revenue as well as its federal payment to provide 
abortions for the poor. It also sought to toughen the ban so that the 
district's own money could no longer be spent on abortions deemed necessary 
because the mother's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred during debate on the D.C. appropriations bill for fiscal 
1990, later sent to the Senate. It liberalizes federal abortion law as it is 
applied to D.C. But the federal district remains severely restricted in using 
money it gets from the U.S. Treasury for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to further restrict public funding of abortions in 
D.C.

Savings and Loan Rescue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 170 to 250, the House rejected a GOP attempt to put the cost of 
the savings and loan rescue off the federal budget. The vote kept the thrift 
bailout bill from being sent back to a House-Senate conference committee, where 
the off-budget language was to have been added. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the bill was returned to conference, following the Senate's 
refusal to waive the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law to permit counting the 
multibillion-dollar bailout as part of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was how to treat about $50 billion in immediate borrowing needed to 
close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts and meet insurance obligations to 
depositors. The reworked bill taken up by the House and Senate late Friday put 
$20 billion of the borrowing on this year's budget, as most Democrats wanted, 
and left the remaining $30 billion to be raised by industry bonds as advocated 
by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported an off-budget financing arrangement for the 
savings and loan bailout.

BAILOUT BILL HAS SOUTHLAND S&amp;L REVISING ITS GAME PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of its deal to buy ailing Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan in late 
December, the New York merchant banking firm of Castle Harlan Inc. had to chart 
a business plan that satisfied federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Castle Harlan must rewrite Irvine-based Western Empire's recovery plan 
to satisfy a new set of regulatory requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire, with two branches in Orange County, is typical of hundreds of 
savings and loan associations across the nation that must adjust to radical 
changes mandated by the S&amp;L bailout legislation signed Wednesday by 
President George Bush. They are healthy or recovering thrifts that worry that 
some of the new provisions in the bill are onerous and, in some cases, renege 
on promises that regulators made late last year as they hurried to peddle 
dozens of insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"We were outside investors who came in with cold cash, and now they're changing 
the rules on us," said Rob Wages, a Castle Harlan employee and Western Empire 
director. "We're disappointed with the legislation. Certainly anyone who goes 
forward with any bailout of an S&amp;L has to keep in mind that the government 
can change the rules at any time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$6 Million in Goodwill 
</P>
<P>
After posting losses for more than two years, Western Empire has started 
recording profits in the past two months. A key element of Western Empire's 
return to profitability is gains from trading in high-yield corporate 
securities, often called junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
And nearly $6 million in previous losses were converted to goodwill, an 
intangible asset that has no real value yet boosts capital, a thrift's final 
protection from losses. Under the purchase agreement, regulators gave Western 
Empire 20 years to write off that goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, however, forbids S&amp;Ls from using federally insured deposits to 
trade in junk bonds and gives institutions five years to liquidate their 
portfolios of such bonds. It also sets up tough new capital standards and 
requires that goodwill be eliminated from calculations of capital within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond trading "was a major part of our business plan," Wages said. And the 
requirement to bolster capital while writing off goodwill creates "a very big 
hit on earnings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although frustrated by the rule changes, Castle Harlan is "committed" to the 
S&amp;L and will revise its business plan to comply with the new law and to 
provide the parent company with the returns it expects, Wages said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many investors who bought thrifts in the waning days of 1988, Castle 
Harlan did not receive financial assistance. It paid $15.8 million in cash for 
Western Empire, and only $50,000 of that went to the former owners. The 
remainder erased the S&amp;L's negative net worth and provided a cushion of 
capital that allowed it to resume its growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact of Junk Bonds 
</P>
<P>
But regulators did approve two important items in the deal -- the inclusion of 
goodwill as part of the S&amp;L's assets and capital base and the ability to 
start trading in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, Western Empire had $121 million -- or 25% -- of its assets 
in junk bonds, according to the S&amp;L's figures. 
</P>
<P>
"A large part of our operation in terms of turning the S&amp;L around is based 
on high-yield securities," Wages said. "We're going to have to take a look at 
the impact of the law on our operations." 
</P>
<P>
He termed the five-year phase-out period a "constructive" compromise and said 
the S&amp;L would be able to comply. 
</P>
<P>
One option allowed in the law, he said, is to create an affiliate that would be 
sufficiently funded -- not with deposits -- to engage in junk bond trading. It 
may be possible, for instance, to move the portfolio to the affiliate and 
provide the S&amp;L with a promissory note to cover the deposits used to buy 
the junk bonds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Creating an affiliate, though, could mean that the S&amp;L would cut back the 
amount of assets it puts into mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
"If the legislation forces thrifts into mortgages only, there will be a 
dramatic reduction in assets in the industry because mortgages are not making 
money for S&amp;Ls," he predicted. "A lot of thrifts will be put out of 
business, and home owners will pay more for mortgages and get less for 
deposits." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Cost Seen 
</P>
<P>
Castle Harlan has not decided how it will change its operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The total cost to everyone will be higher because the law is limiting an 
S&amp;L's ability to invest in an area in which it has expertise to help 
bootstrap itself out of trouble," Wages said. 
</P>
<P>
Wages is not as concerned with the new requirement to raise the capital level. 
</P>
<P>
Writing off $5.9 million in goodwill over five years instead of 20 means that 
the S&amp;L must subtract $1.2 million a year -- or $295,000 a quarter -- from 
its pretax earnings. That's a big bite from an institution that is only now 
starting to post modest profits, he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Although it lost $1.1 million in the first six months of this year, the S&amp;L 
recorded a modest profit in May and June totaling $55,000. At the same time 
last year, Wages said, the S&amp;L was losing $500,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, Western Empire had $492 million in assets and its capital 
exceeded the requirements spelled out in the new law. But if it needs more 
capital in the future, Wages said, it should have little trouble raising 
adequate cash from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
As long as it can bring more cash into its capital base, goodwill won't be a 
problem. The S&amp;L can still write it off over 20 years, Wages said; it just 
cannot include goodwill in its calculation of capital for regulators after five 
years. Its goodwill at the end of June was $5.7 million, or about 1% of its 
assets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, if we were presented with the same deal to buy Western Empire, 
we might not choose to do it," he said. "But we are committed to what we've 
done and think there's enough flexibility in the new law to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WESTERN EMPIRE SAVINGS AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire, which opened in 1981 as Placentia Linda Savings &amp; Loan, was 
acquired in 1988 by Castle Harlan Inc., an investment banking group from New 
York. Western has headquarters in Irvine and another office in Yorba Linda.

MAI ENDS BID FOR PRIME UNIT BUT LEBOW DOESN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

MAI Basic Four on Thursday scrapped its $525-million cash offer to buy Prime 
Computer's minicomputer business, a proposal that has appeared doomed since 
Prime agreed last week to sell the whole company to a New York venture capital 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
But New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, MAI's controlling shareholder, will 
continue to pursue a purchase of the Prime unit by waging a proxy fight through 
an MAI affiliate, Brooke Partners. LeBow is seeking to oust Prime's directors 
by proposing an alternative slate of directors at the Natick, Mass., firm's 
Aug. 24 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
LeBow's candidates have committed to selling Prime's minicomputer business to 
MAI, a Tustin computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 4, Prime accepted an offer of $1.2 billion from J. H. Whitney &amp; Co. 
The New York firm originally offered $1.4 billion for the company but reduced 
its bid after Prime reported a loss of nearly $19 million for its latest 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
MAI had been pursuing a purchase of all or part of Prime for nearly nine 
months. Most recently, the Tustin firm had sought to buy just the minicomputer 
unit, which represents about one-third of Prime's revenue, for $525 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fred D. Anderson, MAI's chief financial officer, conceded that the proxy fight 
for the minicomputer division is a long shot. But, he said: "There is still a 
possibility the Whitney deal could fall through." 
</P>
<P>
MAI allowed its hostile tender offer for all of Prime to expire late last 
month. The offer for the minicomputer unit expired Wednesday.

Wildlife Federation Lists Polluters: Aluminum Co. of America topped a list of 
the nation's 500 largest polluters published by the National Wildlife 
Federation. The conservation group ranked an Alcoa plant at Calhoun, Tex., as 
No. 1 in terms of the pounds of pollutants released into the environment. The 
group said the plant released 465.3 million pounds of pollutants in 1987, the 
latest year for which figures are available. The Great Lakes division of 
National Steel Corp. in Wayne, Mich., was a close second at 423.1 million 
pounds. Two other Alcoa plants in Milam, Tex., and Bauxite, Ark., were among 
the top 10 of the list, made up mostly of metal, chemical, oil, drug, paper and 
mining companies.

Yields on Treasury Bonds Fall: Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to the 
lowest level in nearly three years as the government completed a series of debt 
auctions intended to raise $44.5 billion. The average yield was 8.14%, down 
from 9.11% at the last auction on May 11. It was the lowest rate since 30-year 
bonds averaged 7.54% on Nov. 6, 1986. The bonds will carry a coupon interest 
rate of 8.125%, with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,983.30. A total 
of $9.75 billion in bonds was sold out of bids totaling $20.1 billion. In 
addition, the Treasury auctioned special short-term debt instruments totaling 
$15 billion, which included the first $5 billion raised to pay for the savings 
and loan bailout.

Colorado bankers, gearing up for a wave of takeovers in the 1990s, are hoping 
the Rocky Mountain region's economy bounces back sufficiently to allow them to 
fetch fat prices for their institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado opens its borders to out-of-state banks on Jan. 1, 1991, but unless 
the economy turns around, larger predators may not be willing to put out much 
money for the banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Interest in Colorado banks is going to be a function of what is going on in 
the economy and whether or not we have straightened out our asset quality 
problems," said Colorado National Bankshares Inc. Chairman Will Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
"1991 could be a non-event unless asset quality improves," said Robert Malone, 
president of First Interstate Bank of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Such worries about takeover appeal are unusual in this era of hostile 
takeovers, when so many companies are fighting off unwanted suitors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emerging From Slump 
</P>
<P>
But the fact is that many small banks around the country have done very well as 
a result of the consolidation in the industry, a reflection of changing banking 
laws and economic realities. 
</P>
<P>
In some states, particularly in the South and mid-Atlantic regions, big banks 
have paid generous prices -- two to three times book value -- to establish a 
foothold, enriching bankers who often hold substantial stock in their 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
What acquirers typically look for are rich deposit bases, in other words 
wealthy inhabitants, a thriving business environment and strong growth 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Colorado, still emerging from an oil- and real estate-related 
depression, is not a prime profit center. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts say the big banks are not likely to skip the state 
because its long-term prospects are bright. 
</P>
<P>
"I do expect there to be takeovers after Jan. 1, 1991, because, despite the 
fact we are in a recession, Colorado is a dynamic economy that is attractive 
long term," said Bruce Hoyt at Boettcher &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The state has one of the most rapidly growing populations in the country, a 
well-educated work force and inexpensive office space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gradual Recovery 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Hoyt said he believed that the banks most likely to go first are 
Colorado National, Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. and United Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a rush to buy Colorado banks as they start being healthier. Then 
people will be willing to pay more," said Les Biller, chief of mergers and 
acquisitions at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
He said Norwest is eager to enter the state, and a spokesman at New York's 
Citicorp, which has local operations in Colorado, said it may go shopping after 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders at the five biggest Colorado banks said the state's economy has 
bottomed out, and real estate problems due to overbuilding in the early 1980s 
are starting to abate. 
</P>
<P>
"Trends are better. Looking at our portfolio, there is less stuff in the basket 
beginning to rot," said Charles Hazelrigg, president of United Banks of 
Colorado Inc., the state's biggest bank with assets of $5.7 billion.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: BIG BANKS GO SERENADING; 
</P>
<P>
LARGE INSTITUTIONS LAUNCH CAMPAIGNS TO WOO ACCOUNTS FROM SMALL FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The days of small-business owners timidly approaching big bankers with hat in 
hand appear to be over. Big banks are aggressively wooing small-business 
owners, openly acknowledging that small business is where Southern California's 
-- and the nation's -- real economic growth lies. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, the state's largest bank, formed a small-business marketing 
group last summer. The group created the "Small Business Alliance" program, 
automatically enrolling about 340,000 small-business account holders in April. 
Members can take advantage of discounted banking services such as payroll 
services, a toll-free advice hot line, a quarterly newsletter, seminars and 
reduced rates on products and services such as car rentals. 
</P>
<P>
In response to B of A's marketing campaign, nearly every other major bank has 
stepped into the fray, entering a market historically left to the smaller, 
independent banks. This sudden interest in small-business clients amuses many 
executives at smaller banks. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Crowell, president and chief executive of Laguna Hills-based Eldorado 
Bancorp, has been watching the marketing campaigns with interest. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we haven't seen any effect," said Crowell, who was one of the founders 
of the 17-year-old bank, which has five branches in Orange County, two in 
Riverside County and one in San Bernardino County. "We still feel as an 
independent bank, we have closer ties to the smaller-business person than the 
larger banks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Banks Preferred 
</P>
<P>
Crowell, whose bank has assets of about $250 million, said smaller banks 
watched their loan business increase when the bigger banks began establishing 
regional loan approval centers a few years ago. The rationale for such centers 
was that loan losses could be reduced if lending authority was taken away from 
the branches. But, Crowell said, small-business owners who were forced to 
travel far and deal with more bureaucracy, instead turned to their small, local 
bank for help. 
</P>
<P>
Now it appears that the big banks have figured out that most small-business 
owners prefer to deal with a neighborhood institution. And in response, the big 
banks are sending more senior executives with lending authority back into the 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
"We want better and more experienced bankers to serve small-business owners," 
said Steve Carpenter, a former executive vice president at Wells Fargo who was 
brought in as a vice chairman in charge of Security Pacific's new small- and 
mid-sized business program, known as middle-market bank. 
</P>
<P>
Under Carpenter's leadership, the new group is marketing a line of services to 
companies with sales between $2 million and $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said Security Pacific's branch executives will not only have loan 
approval authority but will act as business consultants for their 
small-business clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The small-business person is a tough one to finance," Carpenter said. "We want 
to make darn sure we pick bright people and marry them up to the right CPAs, 
lawyers and partners." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scores Open Every Day 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter and his colleagues at other banks said they are anxious to tap into 
the businesses that represent the real job growth in California. 
</P>
<P>
He said there will probably not be any huge new aerospace companies moving into 
town, but there are scores of new small businesses opening every day. (A recent 
Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey revealed that nationwide, small businesses will 
create 1.5 million new jobs this year -- accounting for 56.6% of the total 2.6 
million jobs.) 
</P>
<P>
To better reach these growing companies, First Interstate Bank of California 
has six regional business banking centers, each serving as home to a team of 
commercial lenders, according to Patricia Bracher, vice president and business 
banking coordinator for First Interstate's Metro Los Angeles division. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure there are about 21,000 companies with sales in the $1-million to 
$10-million range in what we consider the metropolitan Los Angeles area," 
Bracher said. 
</P>
<P>
She said First Interstate is following the lead of the independent banks "which 
have done a superb job in relationship banking." 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same approach, but we can offer a full range of services that an 
independent bank cannot," Bracher said. 
</P>
<P>
One new First Interstate product is a Business Advance Line, which is a secured 
or unsecured line of credit ranging from $25,000 to $350,000. Business owners 
can write checks on their credit line without having to apply for individual 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Executives Reassigned 
</P>
<P>
Sanwa Bank California is also pursuing small-business clients but does not plan 
to package the services, according to Margaret Merrett, vice president of 
corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our business services are geared toward the small-business person," 
said Merrett. Among them: a simplified pension plan, tax deferred retirement 
plans and a full range of cash management services, including payroll and wire 
transfers. Sanwa also provides courier service for non-cash items, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Union Bank, two executives have recently been reassigned to help clients 
apply for Small Business Administration loan guarantees, according to spokesman 
Mike Colwell. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always paid attention to small-business owners," Colwell said. "They 
have always been of major importance to us." 
</P>
<P>
He said every one of Union's 167 branches has commercial lending authority, 
which is a "real plus" for small-business clients who need a quick answer on 
their loan requests. Meanwhile, Patricia Hudson, vice president in charge of 
small-business marketing for the Bank of America, said the Alliance program has 
been very well received. 
</P>
<P>
"We see ourselves as a champion of small-business clients at the bank," Hudson 
said. She said new services such as a free business banking analysis are not 
only helping current customers but drawing in new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so pleased with the branch support for all of this," Hudson said. She said 
the branch managers are setting small-business sales goals and working hard to 
meet them. 
</P>
<P>
"Small-business clients tend to be among the most important clients at any 
branch because they have deeper relationships with their bankers -- and they 
usually have both their business and personal accounts in one place," Hudson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Store Tops L.A. List of SBA Lenders 
</P>
<P>
According to the Small Business Administration, the Money Store Investment 
Corp. in Encino led the list of the largest SBA lenders in Los Angeles last 
year. The Money Store funded 55 loans for a total of $17.4 million. Next in 
line was Government Funding in Los Angeles, with 72 loans totaling $15.7 
million. Three independent banks ranked third, fourth and fifth; Mechanics 
National Bank in Paramount, Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Glendale and Mid City 
Bank in Los Angeles.

FIELD SURVEYS SHOW REBOUND FROM DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
CORN CROP UP 49% OVER '88, USDA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Corn production is rebounding from last year's drought, the Agriculture 
Department said Thursday, estimating the 1989 crop at 7.35 billion bushels, an 
increase of 49% over last fall's stunted harvest of 4.9 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
The estimates were based on USDA's first field surveys of the year and 
reflected conditions as of Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put total U.S. crop 
production at 103% of the 1977 average, a scale used to compare output from 
year to year. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures came a week after Congress, responding to flooding in the 
South and drought in the Great Plains, approved an $897-million disaster relief 
bill for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
While corn and soybean production were estimated at about average for the 
decade, wheat production across the Grain Belt was forecast at weaker than 
usual levels, with fields losing substantial moisture since early July. 
</P>
<P>
Corn is the largest and most important crop grown on American farms and, used 
as feed, is essential to meat, poultry and dairy production. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Department economists had projected the corn crop at 7.85 billion 
bushels in June and revised that to 7.45 billion last month due in part to late 
plantings in the eastern Corn Belt and dry fields in the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Better Yield 
</P>
<P>
In the Midwest, however, rains starting in mid-July replenished some of the 
subsoil moisture that had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
USDA economists estimated the yield per acre of corn in 1989 at 112.8 bushels 
an acre, up 28.2 bushels from last year but 6.6 bushels below the record high 
of 119.4 bushels produced in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
They estimated that 65.2 million acres would be harvested, up 12% from 1988 but 
1% less than the July forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean production was estimated at 1.91 billion bushels, up 24% from last 
year's harvest of 1.54 billion. 
</P>
<P>
USDA economists forecast the soybean yield at 32.3 bushels an acre, the fourth 
highest on record and 24% above a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Production of all wheat was estimated at 2.04 billion bushels, up 13% from the 
1988 harvest of 1.81 billion bushels. That was 3% below the July estimate from 
USDA. 
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down 6% from 
last year. Durum wheat was indicated at 90.7 million bushels, up 102% from the 
1988 harvest but down 19% from the July forecast because of drought problems in 
the Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
The average yield for all wheat was forecast at 32.6 bushels an acre, just 1.5 
below last year's level, with an estimated area for harvest of 62.7 million 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drop in Supplies 
</P>
<P>
Other spring wheat was forecast at 487 million bushels, down 10% from the July 
forecast but more than double the 1988 crop. 
</P>
<P>
With the Soviet grain crop forecast down and export prospects good, stocks of 
wheat next June are projected at 474 million bushels, almost 120 million below 
last month and 220 million below the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton production was estimated at 11.8 million bales, down 23% from last year 
and 20% below 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices for food rose at an annualized rate of 7% in the first half of 
1989 as cold weather hit vegetable fields in Florida, California and Mexico. 
Poultry prices also rose sharply on increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
But USDA economists are expecting consumer prices to rise no more than 1% on an 
annualized basis in the second half.

ANALYSTS EXPECT WORLD SUGAR PRICES TO SOAR

Consumers face higher costs for candy, soft drinks and other sweet products 
this year, with tight supplies and speculative fervor poised to send sugar 
prices soaring on world markets, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
But they could collapse as fast as they rise, leaving the ultimate impact on 
consumer prices unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a price spike, just like we have had in the past," Margaret 
Blamberg, vice president for economic research at Amstar Sugar Corp., told an 
industry meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The speculators will run it up, and prices will go down just as fast," she 
said. In 1974 and 1980, sugar prices rose several times and then plummeted, but 
not before costs of many sugar-containing products had increased. 
</P>
<P>
World prices for raw sugar are projected to soar from current levels of about 
14 cents a pound to 21.5 cents and then fall to about 10 cents a pound, 
according to the average estimates of a panel of four industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Tight sugar supplies are expected to fuel the increase because world sugar 
consumption has outpaced production for the past four years and could do so 
again this year, said David Berg, economic research manager for American 
Crystal Sugar Co. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks could fall to their lowest levels since 1980-1981, when world sugar 
prices topped 40 cents a pound, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Speculative interest in sugar has also been rising steadily in recent years, 
fueled by an increase in commodity fund assets, he said. That could force 
prices higher than purely fundamental considerations would warrant. 
</P>
<P>
"Emotion and greed will play a major role in market movements," said Berg. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sugar prices already are higher than world prices -- about 23 cents for a 
pound of raw sugar and 40 cents for refined sugar on grocery shelves -- because 
of government price supports. But American sugar refiners could increase their 
own prices if world prices rise. 
</P>
<P>
"If the world price became the dominant influence on domestic prices, we would 
follow that," said James Burt, senior vice president for sales and marketing at 
California &amp; Hawaii Sugar Co. 
</P>
<P>
Whether makers of sugar-containing products use a sugar price hike as 
justification for raising their own prices may depend on how long the sugar 
price stays high and how consumers react, said Berg. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where it gets to be politically difficult," he said.

JAPAN'S U.S. REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS SURGE; 
</P>
<P>
LEVEL IS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF GREAT BRITAIN'S

Japan's buying of U.S. commercial real estate has surged ahead since 1986 and 
its $10.02 billion in holdings last year was far larger than any other 
country's, the U.S. General Accounting Office says. 
</P>
<P>
"Most countries' positions have remained somewhat stable, with the notable 
exception of Japan, which in just a few years has grown from a relatively 
modest share to almost double that held by the United Kingdom," said Allan I. 
Mendelowitz, the director of the office for trade, energy and finance issues. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese holdings increased 64.3% from 1987 to 1988, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The office makes audits for Congress. Mendelowitz's statement came in a letter 
to Sen. Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota. The letter, dated July 31, was made 
available Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Portion of Total 
</P>
<P>
Britain's commercial real estate holdings in 1988 were given as $5.32 billion. 
Britain was followed by Canada with $4.17 billion, the Netherlands with $3.34 
billion and the Netherlands Antilles with $3.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Burdick updated a report to him of July 10. That report listed 
the Netherlands Antilles, a group of five small Caribbean Islands, as one of 
four "identity havens" used to conceal the names of owners. The others were 
Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The figures represent only a small proportion of total real estate values in 
the United States. The National Assn. of Realtors, a private group, estimated 
last November that the value of all foreign real estate holdings in 1986 was 
only 1.5% of U.S. commercial holdings, excluding farmland and land used for 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens of other countries owned even a smaller proportion of American farms 
-- about 1%, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
It said foreign holdings of farmland amounted to almost 12.5 million acres 
worth nearly $9.5 billion in 1988. Britons were the biggest holders with 10.6 
million acres, followed by the Swiss with 2.8 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
Using an older set of figures, the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce 
Department valued at $90.9 billion all commercial property held by 
non-Americans in 1987.

BROKERS TEAM UP, GIVING FIRMS A SINGLE CONTACT WITH A NATIONAL REACH 
</P>

<P>
When Bernard Baber, who handles real estate for Seattle-based Airborne Freight 
Corp., needed a warehouse in New York and another in Hawaii, he didn't have to 
worry about finding reliable real estate brokers 5,000 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
Baber just called David Blanchard, his contact at New America Network, a 
company that links independent commercial brokers in 180 markets around the 
country. New America has helped Baber close 57 deals during the past four 
years, and Blanchard was able to help him again by calling two New America 
affiliates, giving them Baber's requirements and monitoring their search for 
warehouse space. 
</P>
<P>
With Airborne expected to grow by 40% this year, according to Baber, 
consistency and control over brokerage services is essential. "Otherwise, the 
whole process would degenerate into chaos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advantages of Giants 
</P>
<P>
New America is one of three networks of independent commercial real estate 
brokers formed to serve large companies with locations across the country. 
Pressure from clients who need help finding or disposing of space in distant 
markets isn't the only impetus for joining a network. Brokers with high 
ambitions want to compete with the three biggest real estate companies, Cushman 
&amp; Wakefield, Grubb &amp; Ellis and Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate 
Services, each of which has more than 50 branches serving markets from Boston 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For brokers who lack the desire or resources to set up and supervise an 
extensive branch system, joining a network that can duplicate many of the 
giants' advantages seems an ideal solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I was never attracted to (the idea of establishing) national and 
international branch offices," said Edward S. Gordon, whose Edward S. Gordon 
Co. is one of New York's biggest brokerages and is a founder of the 
member-owned, 11-year-old Office Network, which links the dominant independent 
real estate firms in 109 American markets and 10 foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not mean that we do not do national and international business," he 
added. "What we require from the network is local market expertise, to save us 
the burden of acquiring it." 
</P>
<P>
The two other networks are Colliers International Property Consultants, an 
Australia-based company with a strong presence on the Pacific Rim, and New 
America Network, the largest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
What the networks offer corporate clients is a national reach and a single 
contact, who may be either the broker in the client's hometown or a network 
staff member. They attempt to overcome the parochialism of local brokerages 
while capitalizing on the advantage of that same narrow focus: a deep 
understanding of a local market. Referrals are made from one affiliate to 
another, or from network headquarters to affiliates, as clients need services 
in different markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needed Organization 
</P>
<P>
Financial arrangements vary. Membership dues go as high as $100,000 a year, and 
networks take up to 10% off the top of commissions. Brokers who work on a deal 
negotiate a split of the rest up front. 
</P>
<P>
"What the (brokerage) profession really needed was some way of organizing it so 
that a company could make one call and have whatever they needed -- whether it 
was information, or disposing of 50 properties at the same time or buying 100 
properties at the same time," said Gerald Finn, a New Jersey developer who 
formed New America Network 10 years ago to answer corporate real estate 
executives' complaints about brokers. 
</P>
<P>
New America's relationship with Airborne shows how networks function at their 
best. Baber had grown frustrated using local brokerages because they were 
inconsistent and viewed each assignment as a one-shot deal. He had tried 
national companies but found them sometimes indifferent to his special needs. 
</P>
<P>
New America closes an Airborne deal somewhere in the United States every 10 
days.

CHARGES SOUGHT AGAINST DRIVER WHO HIT VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol will seek charges against the driver of a car 
that plowed into a school van for failing to stop at a red light. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokeswoman Leslie Lazo said the agency will ask that Jung Sook Park, 30, 
of Norwalk be charged with failing to stop at a red light and not using seat 
belts. 
</P>
<P>
CHP mechanics found no mechanical failure of the brakes or tail lights in 
Park's 1988 Oldsmobile. Witnesses told investigators that they did not see 
Park's brake lights go on before she hit the school van and that she was 
traveling up to 40 m.p.h., Lazo said. 
</P>
<P>
Park had told investigators that her brakes had failed when she tried to stop 
after seeing the van but that she could not remember the color of the traffic 
light after she was leaving Garden Grove Freeway on Monday afternoon, Lazo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Park crashed into the side of the school bus after leaving the off-ramp on 
Magnolia Street. The van, which was carrying a teacher and eight children, 
overturned on impact and rammed into a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Park and her two children, Angie, 5, and Anni, 4, were taken to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where they were admitted. Park's children were released 
Tuesday, and she was listed in good condition Thursday with head cuts. 
</P>
<P>
All but one child from the school van were treated at Humana 
Hospital-Westminster and Garden Grove Medical Center and released. The most 
seriously hurt, Russell Lewis, 7, is in good condition at Humana Hospital after 
suffering a severe cut and fractures in his right arm.

'HISTORIC' $3-MILLION FIRE STATION DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's newest fire station, at 31461 Street of the Golden Lantern, was 
dedicated Thursday afternoon, with county Supervisor Thomas Riley praising the 
"historic" development agreement that funded the $3-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
"History is really being made here today," Riley told the audience of about 150 
at the new station. Riley said the station is the first to be built in the 
county's Fifth Supervisorial District using solely private funds from 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
The 9,200-square-foot fire station was built by Shea Homes, which is paying 
about 48% of the cost for the building and fire equipment. Taylor Woodrow Homes 
California Ltd. is paying 45% of the cost, and the remaining 7% is being paid 
by Standard Pacific of Orange County, O'Hill Partners, C2H2 Ltd., and Shea 
Business Properties. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, called Bear Brand Fire Station No. 49, is a single-story 
wood-frame stucco building with a concrete tile roof. About a mile north of the 
Dana Point city boundary, the station is designed to add fire protection to 
that city, San Juan Capistrano and the many subdivisions in Laguna Niguel.

CHILDREN JOIN IN PEACEFUL PROTEST AGAINST ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-abortion demonstrators staged a peaceful protest outside a family-planning 
clinic in Orange on Thursday as their children waved signs at oncoming cars on 
busy Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour demonstration drew about 250 people and was one of nine staged 
Thursday in Southern California by Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group 
that has organized similar protests across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange, children sat on the curb waving pictures of dead fetuses and 
carrying signs with messages such as, "Please stop killing us." 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the children know their parents have been active in picketing, and the 
desire of a lot of children was to participate," said Russell Neal, a spokesman 
for Operation Rescue. "They are the survivors of the abortion holocaust of the 
last 16 years." 
</P>
<P>
About 40 sign-carrying abortion-rights activists demonstrated alongside the 
Operation Rescue group. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't here to outnumber them," said Barbara Jackson, a member of the 
Orange County Pro-Choice Coalition. "We are just monitoring to make sure that 
nothing illegal is done and that women are able to get into the clinic." 
</P>
<P>
Family Planning Associates Medical Group, at Chapman Avenue and the Orange 
Freeway, remained open during the demonstration, a clinic employee said. "It's 
not stopping anything," the employee added. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and other abortion-rights demonstrators criticized Operation Rescue for 
involving children in the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very busy intersection," Jackson said. "It's unconscionable to bring 
children down here. I'm just crossing my fingers that someone doesn't get 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice demonstrator Rachel Stephens said having children as protesters is 
"manipulative and abusive. . . . I don't think the children are old enough to 
really grasp the issue at hand." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was dangerous to have children standing within feet of oncoming 
traffic, Neal said, "It's not nearly as dangerous as it is for the other 
children" in the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who brought their children to the demonstration was Shauna Clemens, 
21, of Huntington Beach. "I just don't believe in abortion," said Clemens, 
standing on the Chapman Avenue sidewalk with one hand on the stroller where her 
6-month-old son slept. "I'm a single mother, and it is possible to raise a 
child."

DOUG SMITH QUIETLY GIVES THE RAMS AN ANCHOR FOR THE OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With no incidents or scandals to speak of, and malice toward none, Ram center 
Doug Smith has peacefully survived almost as many style changes as coaching 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, you could blackmail Smith with the threat of wallpapering the locker 
room with his rookie mug shots of 1978, when Smith's hair raged like a 
five-alarm fire in a coif best described as early Angela Davis. 
</P>
<P>
And that was only from the neck up. Consider the times. 
</P>
<P>
"Three-piece suits, wide lapels," Smith said ashamedly. "Shirts unbuttoned to 
your navel. Gold chains." 
</P>
<P>
From disco to rap, Carter to Bush, George Allen to John Robinson, Smith has 
endured with hardly a peep or a headline. This despite five consecutive Pro 
Bowl appearances at center, the stuff of heroes in some National Football 
League cities. Somehow, Smith has always blended in nicely with the drapes. 
</P>
<P>
The Doug Smith Family -- wife Debbie and the girls, Jessica and Jenna -- might 
be found on any off-season weekend at a shopping mall near you. Chances are 
you'd walk right past them. 
</P>
<P>
Some have suggested it's the Randy Cross beer commercial syndrome. Perhaps if 
Smith dropped a wrapper at South Coast Plaza and reached down to pick it up . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, aren't you Doug Smith of the Rams?" 
</P>
<P>
But he's so anonymous he doesn't even get parts for anonymous players. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Smith has always been comfortable with his non-image, actually preferring 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the low profile, from the press to the shopping malls," he said during 
his 12th Rams' training camp. "Some people recognize me, but I know they're big 
football fans if they do. But I'd just as soon be at liberty to do that, to go 
to a concert where nobody knows you're a football player. You can enjoy it like 
a normal fan, or a normal shopper." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Smith has become as dependable as your favorite watch. For years, 
sidekick Dennis Harrah did the talking, Smith the blocking. It worked well 
enough for Groucho and Harpo. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith looked up recently and found himself hunched over center, very much 
alone. He's now the second oldest Ram in seniority at 32, trailing only Jackie 
Slater, two slots down at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
When Smith broke into the league, George Allen was coaching the Rams, though he 
lasted only two exhibition games in 1978. Smith will never forget the fear of 
arriving in Fullerton as a free agent from Bowling Green, his future so much in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I graduated from college, got married, had a week honeymoon and came to 
California," Smith said. "I left my wife in Ohio. My $2,000 signing bonus 
wasn't enough to pay first and last month's rent for an apartment out here." 
</P>
<P>
Smith still sees the glazed look in every free agent's eyes. Some things don't 
change, though it seems everything else has. 
</P>
<P>
"I made $27,500 my first year and thought I was rich," Smith said. "I was 
making more money than my dad at the time, and he was vice president of a 
company back home, a wholesale grocery company. Now, I make 16 times that and I 
still don't feel like I have any money." 
</P>
<P>
Smith can look back now and appreciate how close he was to never making it. In 
1978, the Rams drafted Colorado center Leon White in the third round. He, not 
Smith, was to be the team's center. But five knee surgeries in two years took 
White out of the picture, and the camera suddenly zoomed to Smith, who was 
running his football race like the famous tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he gained confidence by finally ignoring everyone else's press 
clippings. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought, 'How am I ever going to block Jack Youngblood," he said. 
"(Running back) Elvis Peacock was our first draft choice. I'd followed him, 
read the press clippings. I thought, 'How am I going to play on the same team 
as Elvis Peacock?' You know, $100,000 to sign, that kind of thing. And then I 
met them and I said these guys aren't stronger than I am, they're not bigger 
than I am." 
</P>
<P>
In his first exhibition game, Smith was rushed into action to replace Rich 
Saul, who had dislocated a finger. When he didn't fall on his face, Smith knew 
he had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest frustration was not playing in the Rams' only Super Bowl appearance 
in 1980. Smith had been rotating at guard through the first five games of the 
1979 season before tearing a ligament in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
He watched Super Bowl XIV from the sidelines. Again, Smith considers how times 
have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have gotten back in time to play had it happened today," 
Smith said. "Other than styles, that's another thing that's changed incredibly. 
It used to be that even a cartilage used to mean a season." 
</P>
<P>
Now, advances in arthroscopic surgery have pared weeks of recovery time. The 
frustration of that loss and his injury keep Smith coming back each season. He 
keeps hoping for a second act. This time, he plays in a Super Bowl and the Rams 
win. 
</P>
<P>
He figures it isn't any more far-fetched than the story of a free agent no one 
wanted who went on to appear in five consecutive Pro Bowls. It's almost enough 
to spoil a man. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking this morning, "What if you don't get six (Pro Bowls in a row)?" 
he said. "That puts a little pressure on you. If I don't get six, what am I 
going to do? And then I said, 'Doug, you're stupid. Be thankful you have five. 
It's been fantastic, beyond belief for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Free agent Gary Knudson, the team's only healthy tight end entering Saturday 
night's exhibition game against Denver, bruised his right ankle at Thursday's 
practice and was carried off the field on a cart. Trainer Jim Anderson said he 
thinks Knudson will play against the Broncos. Tight end Richard Ashe, though 
nursing a sore leg, also should be available. If not, free-agent center Rodney 
Lossow moves to tight end. . . . Eight of the last 10 first-round picks have 
signed. The two players that haven't are Ram choices Bill Hawkins (21st) and 
Cleveland Gary (26th). Gary still is seeking a four-year, $4-million contract, 
though players around him are signing for half that amount. Not surprisingly, 
the Rams and Gary's agent haven't spoken in days. The team and Hawkins are 
reportedly closer to a deal, though it might take another week to 10 days.

BANKHEAD TRIES TO CARRY THE LOAD ON THE MOUND FOR MARINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without Mark Langston around, there is a lot of pitching that needs to be taken 
care of for the Seattle Mariners, and no one save Scott Bankhead particularly 
up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitching is one thing; for that, the Mariners have Mike Schooler, who 
has saved 23 games, fifth best in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitching? A different matter. 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead, the Mariner starter against the Angels Thursday night, is the only 
Mariner starter with more than 10 victories -- heck, the only one with more 
than six. At 11-4, with a 3.38 earned-run average going into Thursday's game, 
the 26-year-old right-hander is the staff ace -- the lone ace in a low hand. 
Only two other pitchers -- Bill Swift (6-3) and Randy Johnson (5-3) -- have 
winning records. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of inherited a leadership role by default with the trade (to Montreal) 
of Mark Langston," said Bankhead, in his third year in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
With the Mariners going against Chuck Finley Thursday, Bankhead had no easy 
task. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bankhead took a nine-game winning streak into the game, already a club 
record, surpassing among others Langston's seven-game streak in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead hadn't lost a decision since May 17, 15 starts ago. 
</P>
<P>
With a victory, he could have extended his winning streak to 10, matching the 
longest streak in the league last season, which was put together by Storm 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get a victory, but the Mariners did. Bankhead took them through seven 
innings, and left the mound with the scored tied, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Relievers Keith Comstock and Mike Jackson held the line long enough for the 
Mariners to take a 3-2 victory in 10 innings after Jim Presley hit a leadoff 
homer off Finley, who ended up the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead was just a pitcher with a no-decision, which meant the streak was 
intact -- and the Mariners had a small victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Bankhead gave us the chance to win the game," Manager Jim Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
He had to work hard to do that. He gave up two runs in the third on three 
singles and a hit batter -- a Bankhead pitch sent Dick Schofield from the game 
with a broken bone in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw a ball away and I was just trying to come back in," Bankhead said. "I 
just tried to go in and it got away a little bit. I hate to see that happen to 
a guy like that in an important part of the season." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Bankhead stayed out of trouble until the sixth and seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the Angels put runners on third. And twice, the Angels ended the inning 
still tied. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Johnny Ray led off with a single. With one out, Wally Joyner 
singled, sending Ray to third. But Bankhead got Tony Armas to pop to right, too 
shallow to score the run, and then faced Chili Davis. Davis took two called 
strikes on the way to a full count, and then Bankhead sent him down swinging. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, there was more trouble. Bankhead loaded the bases on a single 
and two walks, bringing up Devon White. But he got White to fly to center on 
the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"My responsibility is just to go out and do my job and lead by example," 
Bankhead said. "I'm trying to be consistent and go out and give us a chance to 
win by keeping us in the ball game, especially tonight against Chuck Finley. 
This was a big win for us, the way he is pitching."

JOHN MARINO TRIES TO BUILD STATURE OF RACE ACROSS AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in New Jersey, John Marino, a bowlegged ex-baseball catcher with a 
bad back, climbed off a bike and onto a choice piece of Garden State pavement. 
</P>
<P>
After riding across an entire country, and just 60 miles short of his 
destination -- New York City Hall -- he had discovered that his attempt to 
break the transcontinental record he had set the year before had failed. 
</P>
<P>
Demoralized, dehydrated, degraded and not at all happy, he found he couldn't 
pedal another foot. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years can pass fairly quickly when you're inventing and keeping alive a 
sport that claims the continental United States as its playing field. 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1979 that Marino found himself stuck in the swamps of Jersey. Today 
he finds himself wedged between filing cabinets, copying machines, cycling 
posters, water bottles, boxes of this, shelves of that, in a cramped piece of 
Tustin office space dedicated to one purpose: Race Across AMerica, a bike race 
from one shining sea to another, perhaps the ultimate of the ultra-sports that 
have gained popularity in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
And Marino, who has kept the race going, will watch the eighth edition take off 
Sunday from the Orange County Fairgrounds. In the last couple of months leading 
into the race, it's not unusual for him to work 20-hour days and go without 
sleep some days as he coordinates more than 1,000 volunteers along checkpoints 
30 miles apart across the country. There are programs to be printed and 
sponsors to be swooned. 
</P>
<P>
If there is anyone who will stick to this quest it is Marino, whose capacity to 
persevere is intense but is belied by his mild manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Bulldogs don't bark much," said Paul Cornish, whose transcontinental record 
Marino broke in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Race Across AMerica is having unqualified success in attracting participants -- 
qualifying races are held around the country to come up with about 30 racers. 
But this will be the race's third year without a television contract, which 
makes it hard to draw big-money sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The United States Cycling Federation will not allow its members -- the top 
cyclists in the country -- to compete in RAAM. And some say Marino's creation 
is closer to a TV mini-series than athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what's tougher, dealing with the race or riding in it, Marino smiles, 
"You know, I'd have to rate that a push." 
</P>
<P>
Marino made his first transcontinental ride in 1978. An unlikely feat of 
course, all the more unlikely because Marino was not a cyclist. He was a 
catcher who had played baseball at San Diego State and had been drafted by the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
But a chronic back condition -- he compressed vertebrae weightlifting -- ended 
that career. Depressed, he fled to Europe for two years. Cycling was an 
economic consideration more than a pleasurable activity. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after his return to the United States, he hit upon the idea of riding 
across the country. He had been taking some self-improvement classes from 
Gordon Smith, a Santa Ana man who spoke six languages and had been a Marine 
pilot and concert pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Through methods that included listening to audio tapes, Smith claimed a human 
being could do just about anything. With loose ends dangling from his dream of 
a life in sports, Marino set his sights on running the Boston Marathon. But no 
tape can cure compressed vertebrae and that project was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
Looking through a Guinness Book of World Records one day, he happened upon the 
record for riding across America. The record of 13 days 5 hours 20 minutes was 
held by Cornish, who happened to live in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Marino looked up Cornish's number in the phone book and gave him a call. 
</P>
<P>
"I answered the phone and this guy says, "Hi, I'm going to break your record,' 
" Cornish said. "I asked him how much cycling experience he had? He said 
practically none. I said, 'Good luck.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Cornish, who had made his transcontinental ride just because he said he 
could and a friend said he couldn't, admired Marino's chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this was a guy who was going to work at it," he said. "I didn't think 
he'd make it, but I thought he'd make a credible attempt." 
</P>
<P>
Cornish set up a work program for Marino that started out with the relatively 
infantile distance of 20 miles a day. Two years later, Marino was riding 
hundreds of miles a week. In 1978 he set out on his ride. 
</P>
<P>
He was soon miserable. No amount of training could prepare him for the drudgery 
of riding the plains of Kansas, fighting a head wind, just trying to make it to 
the next grain silo. 
</P>
<P>
His support crew was lying to him about the time and about how long he slept. 
They knew that Marino couldn't ride as fast as Cornish, so he would have to 
out-endure him. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd tell me I'd slept six hours when I'd only slept two," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
He was miserable. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to let my crew down, I knew the only way I could stop with honor 
would be to be injured," he said. "So I kept trying to figure out a way that I 
could fall off the bike and hurt myself without really hurting myself." 
</P>
<P>
He thought about that all the way to the steps of New York's City Hall, where 
he ended his trip in 13 days 1 hour and 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Saddle sores behind him, intoxicated by success as well as TV appearances, 
Marino prepared for another cross-country ride the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Marino had talked to several people about developing the ride into a sporting 
event with multiple entrants. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if my idea was going to fly, I'd have to make the ride again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1979 trip was a disaster from the beginning with rainstorms and routes 
that led to dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
"It was even more miserable than the first trip," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
When his crew informed him in Phillipsburg, N.J., that he had just gone over 
his record, Marino got off his bike and sat down. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't go on." 
</P>
<P>
Crew members fretted about the wrath of sponsors if Marino quit for anything 
short of a broken bone. Somehow a plan, without Marino's knowledge, was 
developed that would take Marino to a Manhattan hospital under the pretext of 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw me in the motor home, drove me to Manhattan, and when I stepped out 
there were reporters, cameras, probably 50 people waiting for me," he said. "My 
first question was, 'Where am I?' But it turned out I was bigger story because 
I hadn't made it." 
</P>
<P>
By 1982, Marino's dream of a transcontinental race was realized. He set out on 
the trip, with three other riders and ABC film crew. ABC condensed the show 
into two hours and won numerous awards for the production. 
</P>
<P>
"They called it soap opera sports," Marino said. "That kind of bugged me at 
first, but from their perspective the sport offered a lot of human drama and 
audiences eat that stuff up." 
</P>
<P>
So much so that ABC chronicled the next three races. But after the 1986 race, 
and some personnel changes at the network, ABC let Marino know it wasn't sure 
about televising the race in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they couldn't tell me for sure until Dec. 31." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a certain large fast-food chain -- golden arches, clown mascot -- 
was interested in sponsoring the event, but only if the race had a national TV 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 31, Marino got the word. ABC would not televise the event, the 
fast-food chain would not sponsor. Happy New Year. 
</P>
<P>
This year's event also won't be televised, something that worries Marino and 
mystifies Peter Rosten, who made an award-winning film about Marino's 1979 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone performs endlessly, cries, laughs, shows raw emotion, the 
audience goes 'Wow,' " said Rosten, who was executive producer of the film, 
"True Believers." "Pro athletes are so cool, they show nothing, but when an 
audience sees just a normal guy like them bearing his soul, that character 
becomes so accessible that they cheer." 
</P>
<P>
Believing as much, and aware that sports survival depends on on coverage, 
Marino asks competitors, their families and friends to stage letter-writing 
campaigns to their local papers and national publications. He claims that 
recent letter-writing campaign to Sports Illustrated gained race coverage from 
that magazine. 
</P>
<P>
There are no big-name sponsors still and Marino is barely breaking even 
personally. In fact, he's working toward become a building contractor in case 
RAAM falls through. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, the popularity of the event continues to grow. For the most part, the 
competitors are in their 30s. Marino attributes that to the fact that racers 
must finance their own operation -- support crew and vehicles, equipment -- 
which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Participants are often 
professionals who have the time for training. 
</P>
<P>
But why train for something that Cornish calls "the pits of holy hell. A 
depressing, sickening, deadening experience." 
</P>
<P>
One reason may be that, like Marino, many of the participants are not lifelong 
cyclists. Marino says they're adventurers. Rosten calls them "heroic idiots." 
</P>
<P>
These are types who take something on because of the challenge. And strange as 
it sounds, riding across America is a very doable challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of it this way," Cornish said. "I can study the piano all I want, but if 
I don't have the God-given talent I'll never be a great pianist. But something 
like this (RAAM) you can achieve just through hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Marino would like to see the day when top young riders who belong to the United 
States Cycling Federation are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that a dramatic race between two top riders might just be the type of 
thing that could capture audiences' imagination. The Ironman Triathlon was 
helped immeasurably when a race between women competitors came down to the wire 
with one attempting to crawl across the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could have something dramatic like that, something that people really 
identify with, it might be enough to push us over the top," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the race struggles on and Marino remains among the clutter of his 
little office, feeling at times that he's stuck somewhere in New Jersey.

TRADE FAIR AT UCI FEATURES FIRMS OWNED BY MINORITIES AND WOMEN

In 1981, Doug Watt was an IBM service technician ready for a risk. He quit his 
job, opened a company called Best Business Machines in Laguna Niguel, and 
looked for business. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Watt signed a $50,000 maintenance contract with UC Irvine, and by 
the end of the year he expects his company to sell $900,000 worth of business 
machines and service. Next year, sales should top $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Watt's success is not uncommon in Orange County, one thing sets him 
apart: He's an American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
Watt was one of 55 vendors who gathered Thursday at UCI to peddle their wares 
at Spotlite '89, the university's second annual business trade fair for 
minority- and women-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The event, Orange County's largest gathering of minority vendors, drew buyers 
from throughout Southern California to view products ranging from chocolate 
roses to Geiger counters. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the buyers represented companies or institutions that are required by 
the government to purchase some portion of their goods and services from 
minority-owned businesses. Among the shoppers were representatives from 
McDonnell Douglas and the University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine, probably the largest buyer at the show, leads California 
universities in purchases from minority businesses, according to Mel Davis, the 
university's small-business coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the university has spent 12% of its $30-million purchasing budget to 
buy laboratory equipment, sheets and towels, and more from minority businesses. 
About 7% has gone to minorities and 5% to women. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from UC Riverside attending the fair also said their campus spends 5% 
to 15% of their purchasing department's budget with minority businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about everything here is something that we might buy," said Russ Lewis, 
UC Riverside's purchasing manager. "We've bought water purifiers, (book) 
binders and other things from companies that are here." 
</P>
<P>
Vendors at the show noted that sales only begin there; the real negotiations 
start after the booths are taken down. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell mostly to large groups like the university or corporations, so people 
don't make orders here," said Arlene Roach, senior account representative for 
Extend-A-Life, a 6-year-old Pasadena-based company which sells 
earthquake-survival kits. "They just want to ask questions about things." 
</P>
<P>
Other companies sold tools made by Latinos, graphic design by blacks and 
radioactive sensors by women. 
</P>
<P>
One of the show's biggest hits was a display of chocolate roses, chocolate 
false teeth, chocolate tool kits and even chocolate surfboards by the Chocolate 
Florist in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Several people today have bought chocolate computers," said Pat Pardoen, who 
opened the shop 1 1/2 years ago. "But mostly, they just look at the stuff and 
can't stop laughing, they like it so much." 
</P>

BEASTIE BOYS, COOL J ARE STILL BRAGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.D. CONSIDINE, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why do so many rap records treat women with such little respect? 
</P>
<P>
Whether the record's tone is as light-hearted and cartoonish as "Girls Ain't 
Nothing but Trouble" by DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince or as smugly 
sinister as Slick Rick's "Treat Her Like a Prostitute," the message remains the 
same: Women are good for sex and little else. 
</P>
<P>
It's a view rap's very language seems to bear out. After all, these guys aren't 
rapping about women, but "girlies," "freaks," "bitches," and " 'ho's." 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, such sexism can be seen as simply an extension of rap's 
exaggeratedly male world view -- one in which braggadoccio is equated with 
power and potency. From this perspective, a rapper's worth is measured by the 
money he can spend and the women he can have; as N.W.A.'s Ice Cube puts it in 
"Gangsta Gangsta": "Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money." 
</P>
<P>
Not that it's always expressed so blatantly, of course. L. L. Cool J, for 
instance, is quite subtle about the sexual power plays he recounts through his 
new album, "Walking With a Panther." Likewise, the densely layered sound of the 
Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique" often makes the group's sound seem to 
overshadow its sexual politics. 
</P>
<P>
But then, L.L. Cool J isn't playing by the same rules as other rappers. Whereas 
once he was the loudest of the loud, brashly describing DJ decimations in the 
likes of "Rock the Bells" or "I'm Bad," Cool J has since developed a delivery 
that manages to seem just as menacing while barely rising above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
As he quietly one-ups the macho-man stereotype in "I'm That Type of Guy," Cool 
J makes plain that talking softly by no means reflects on manhood. If anything, 
the braying belligerence of the other "type of guy" is what makes Cool J seem 
so cool. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even with the change in tactics, "I'm That Type of Guy" still ends up 
fighting the same battle. Never mind that Cool J boasts about pleasing the 
women he sneaks around with; what matters most in this rap is that the women 
"belong" to another man. Consequently, they're incidental to the action, 
because the sexcapades are more about the rivalry between two men than the 
relationship between a man and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he does talk about those relationships, it's in such idealized 
language that there barely seem to be people involved. (Not that this is 
especially unusual. Freud rather adroitly described this mindset as the 
madonna-whore syndrome.) 
</P>
<P>
That may be why Cool J swings unexpectedly from the lovey-dovey sentimentality 
of "You're My Heart" and "One Shot at Love" to the vicious violence of "Fast 
Peg" without providing a middle ground. If anything, the romantic warmth of the 
first two raps makes it all the more chilling to hear him gloat over the 
execution of the gangster's moll in "Fast Peg," as if he felt she was being 
punished for being so beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder there's not much room for women in Cool J's world. Sure, he likes the 
ladies -- the entire premise of "Big Ol' Butt" is that the poor guy can't 
manage a monogamous relationship because, gosh, he's just a victim of his own 
hormones -- but only to the extent that they meet his needs. 
</P>
<P>
The fair sex doesn't fare much better in "Paul's Boutique," the new Beastie 
Boys album. 
</P>
<P>
As before, these three bad boys revel in relating their scams and shenanigans, 
but somehow, what the Beasties have done seems to matter less than how they 
talk about it. Although the raps unabashedly boast of sexual conquest -- in 
"Hey Ladies," the trio actually appears to be under the impression that 
bragging will ultimately bring them more eager young recruits -- their sexual 
adventurism is just another thread in the fabric of the album's picaresque 
narrative. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this arrant sexism all the more appalling is that it stands to undo 
a lot of the good rap has managed for contemporary African-American culture. 
Thanks to rappers such as Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, Stetsasonic 
and the Stop the Violence movement, this music has been a significant source of 
black pride, reinforcing the importance of African-American culture and helping 
to foster a strong sense of self-worth in young listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not everyone has undertaken this cause. For every uplifting 
album such as Boogie Down Production's "Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip 
Hop," there is one like Schoolly D's "Am I Black Enough for You," which uses 
black-power sloganeering as an excuse for the same sort of power games 
phallocentric rappers have been playing since the beginning.

ARTWORK DONATIONS DROP; 
</P>
<P>
NEWPORT HARBOR MUSEUM REPORTS BIG DECREASE AFTER RECORD YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A biannual report just published by Newport Harbor Art Museum reveals a 
significant drop in the donation of works of art during the past two years: 107 
works of art acquired in 1987 and 1988, contrasted with the record 334 works 
acquired during the previous two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, the report also announces that the museum corporation's net 
worth has doubled, from $4 million to $8 million. The report says the increase 
is largely due to pledges and gifts for the museum's planned new building and a 
$300,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the works that the museum did acquire over the last two years included 
pieces by such significant artists as Elmer Bischoff, Ed Ruscha, Joe Goode, 
Edward Kienholz, John McCracken, Alice Aycock, Chris Burden, Bill Viola and 
Allen Ruppersberg. The museum's collection currently includes 1,800 works, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Schimmel, Newport Harbor's chief curator, said the decrease in donations 
of artwork was a direct result of 1986 changes in the U.S. tax code, which made 
it no longer possible for collectors to deduct the full appreciated value of 
their gifts to art museums. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985-86, 3% of new acquisitions were purchases and the other 97% were given 
by 79 donors. But in 1987-88, 18% of the new pieces were purchases and the 
remaining 82% were given by only 27 donors, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously spending more money on acquisitions than we've ever spent," 
Schimmel said. "It is fiscally not in the best interest of donors to give works 
of art. When (people) do give, it's because they really care about the 
institution. They're giving away an enormous potential tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now easier, economically, for someone to give cash (to a museum) to 
acquire works of art than it is to give the works themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"If someone wants to give us an Ed Ruscha (painting), for example, it is easily 
worth $200,000. If they bought that painting three years ago, it was possibly 
for $30,000. That's how much the market has changed. (The collector) can now go 
out and easily sell this thing for $170,000." On the other hand, the collector 
could deduct only the original $30,000 if he gave the painting to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for pieces is such that you can sell (works of art) rather 
quickly," Schimmel said. "The auctions are doing a business like they never 
have before, and not just with high-end (art). It's a very big issue. Art used 
to represent maybe 10, 15% of the net worth of a wealthy person. Now, for some, 
it starts representing 60, 70, 80% of their net worth. That's something family 
members really start taking notice of. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, your top income tax bracket is significantly lower than at the 
beginning of the Reagan Administration, which means that, instead of getting 
the government to pick up 65 or 75 cents on the dollar, it's down to 38 or 42 
cents. It really is a double whammy." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's acquisition woes are part of a nationwide decline in donations 
to art museums. In fiscal 1986, museums received 43,670 objects with a total 
value of $143 million. But two years later, donations were down to 17,035 
objects valued at $67 million, a 63% decline.

DESPITE GOOD INTENTIONS, THIS 'CAT' STUMBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Boys Productions' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" has a few things recommending 
it: Walter Brown's direction occasionally finds the nerves in Tennessee 
Williams' tale of domestic Southern discomfort, and Deidre West has her moments 
as the simmering, desperate Maggie. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the production's charitable aspect -- a dollar will be trimmed 
from the small admission price for anyone bringing a canned good for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the good intentions, this "Cat" ultimately stumbles. Brown's 
approach is respectful but imprecise; the hissing eroticism of Williams' drama 
either becomes muted or is not fully explored. The pacing is too erratic to 
sustain us through many of the crucial turns, and the acting is not as 
sensitive as it should be to "Cat's" layered subtexts. 
</P>
<P>
We do get a pretty clear idea of what's going on, at least on the surface. 
Brown delineates the struggle between beautiful Maggie the Cat and her 
deadened, alcoholic husband Brick. We understand that their problems, mostly 
sexual, are somehow braided into his uniquely personal relationship with 
Skipper, a football buddy who committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also digs somewhat into the black roots of corrupt power that lead to 
patriarch Big Daddy's riches, and the family's nasty fight for control of his 
empire. The key elements are pretty much there. 
</P>
<P>
The failure comes in the shading. More has to be communicated about the kind of 
perverse partnership that Maggie and Brick now have, and how things got to that 
point. Big Mama talks about a marriage going on the rocks and the rocks being 
in bed; we need more of a sense of why this particular bedroom is a stony 
shoal. Williams' writing puts nuance into Brick's involvement with Skipper, and 
we don't get all of it here. 
</P>
<P>
Even Big Daddy, one of the stage's great symbols of selfish appetite, too often 
has a shallowness that belies the character. 
</P>
<P>
As Maggie, West keeps us interested. With her fidgety in-heat anxiety, this is 
a more vulnerable, more self-conscious Maggie than most. But that's all right 
-- there's strength as well. West does have problems, especially early on, with 
the lousy acoustics at Santa Ana City Hall's Annex theater. All those feathery 
Southern vowels just get absorbed; she needs to speak up. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Meek's Brick is relatively quiet and underplayed. It's good to see the 
character held back, away from the bathetic. But there are parts missing. He's 
unfathomable -- sullenness is not enough. A sharper picture of Brick's anger is 
called for, and his heartache -- over Skipper, and over what his life with 
Maggie has become -- needs to be expressed more forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
On opening night Friday, director Brown filled in for Robert Flyer as Big Daddy 
and was reasonably proficient. (The cast change was not explained.) The slight 
Brown, however, lacks the physical presence and dominating persona usually 
associated with the role; he instead gave Big Daddy a weaselly self-absorption 
that wasn't always convincing. 
</P>
<P>
Big Mama, on the other hand, was given a persuasive reading by Sheri Savage, a 
talented and imposing actress. 
</P>
<P>
As the arena for all this familial mendacity (a word that ends up being "Cat's" 
mantra), the uncredited set of Maggie's and Brick's bedroom tends to sprawl 
over the large stage. This creates blocking problems for Brown, who doesn't 
always have his actors in the best positions to interact. 
</P>
<P>

QUILTING SHOW STITCHES UP A LOT OF HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the Crusades to the hot decorating trends of today, quilts have cut a 
colorful swath through the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the Orange County Quilters Guild lets you wrap yourself in 
history at its semiannual show, being held Saturday and Sunday in Cal State 
Fullerton's University Center. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., visitors can view more 
than 200 handmade quilts, take part in seminars on quilting technique and shop 
for antique quilts, needlework and supplies offered by 26 local merchants. 
Docent tours will be available. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think of quilting as a lost art, but that's certainly far from 
the truth," said Thayone Jones, the show chairwoman. "At this show, we'll have 
quilts in all sizes and styles, from tiny crib quilts . . . to really gorgeous 
pieces by master quilters. Some are traditional, some are very modern." 
</P>
<P>
The collection represents thousands of hours of work by guild members, Jones 
added, noting that it takes up to 300 hours to create a mid-size handmade 
quilt. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the display will be 45 quilts made through the Ronald McDonald 
Adopt-a-Bed project. Led by guild member Del Thomas, the project will donate 80 
handmade quilts to the Ronald McDonald House in Orange, a guest facility for 
families of critically ill patients at Childrens Hospital of Orange County, 
when the home opens in November. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 local quilters have participated, stitching full quilts, individual 
squares or blocks, and donating materials. 
</P>
<P>
"A quilt is a comforting thing, so we feel a real connection with the Ronald 
McDonald House," Thomas said. "Most of us associate quilts with caring. . . . 
It gives you solace to have a nice, warm thing to wrap up in." 
</P>
<P>
Although historians bicker about quilting's actual birthday, most say it rode 
into popularity in the 12th Century on the backs of Crusaders, who discovered 
that thick, quilted garments worn beneath their armor kept out the chill and 
cut down on chafing. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, these guys were trend setters because before you could say Holy 
Land, quilted bed coverings were taking the bite off icy nights across the 
known world. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, quilts were simple affairs, consisting of two layers of fabric 
filled with wool, feathers or even moss, and held together with a series of 
small stitches. As time went on, those stitches became more ornate, and 
applique -- the use of fabric pieces stitched into a pattern, then attached to 
a background material -- was introduced. These elaborate quilts soon became 
jealously guarded family heirlooms, passed from generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
Quilts came to the New World in the trunks of Pilgrims. Short on money and a 
long way from fabric merchants, the settlers used scraps of material to patch 
and repatch their hard-working quilts, unintentionally creating the first 
patchwork or piecework designs. 
</P>
<P>
Patchwork quilts -- many featuring repetitive designs sewn together from a 
series of blocks -- grew in popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, and 
their patterns chronicled a nation's childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer women captured their Wild West adventures with such designs as Birds in 
Flight, Hole in the Barn Door and Log Cabin. The quilting bee became an 
all-important social event, with women of all ages gathering to share stitches 
and secrets. 
</P>
<P>
As time went on, the availability of machine-made bedding made quilting all but 
passe. But in the 1960s, Americans renewed their love affair with handcrafts. 
Today quilting is enjoying a new wave of popularity. In Southern California 
alone, there are more than 35 quilter guilds and an extensive network of quilt 
research groups. 
</P>
<P>
Home magazines fueled the quilt craze with their emphasis on country-style 
decorating. Handmade quilts became sought-after, and often pricey, items. 
Today, a handmade quilt at a retail store can run into four figures. At the 
Gazebo of New York store in South Coast Plaza, for example, prices range from 
$400 to almost $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
For those who would like to try their hand at quilting, the Orange County 
Quilters Guild show will include four one-hour seminars on such techniques as 
freezer-paper applique (creating applique patterns from heavy waxed paper), 
quilt basting and frame quilting. The classes will be held at 11 a.m. and 1 
p.m.; guests can register at the information table at the show's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Quilters Guild show will take place Saturday and Sunday from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Cal State Fullerton University Center, 800 N. State 
College Blvd. in Fullerton. Admission: $3 for adults and $2 for seniors and 
students; there will be a small materials fee for some classes. Information: 
(714) 990-5750 or (714) 993-7031.

STYLE: BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT'S TIME TO THINK FURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many of us, it's too hot to think about draping our bodies in animal hides. 
But for those with a fur in their future, it's time to start looking. 
</P>
<P>
As with other garments, the new styles are on the racks, beckoning to buyers 
who want an early start on the season. For those who want a custom-made coat, 
August is the time to place the order. 
</P>
<P>
Among those taking the orders is Rik Kiszely, a fur designer for Neiman Marcus 
for eight years before opening his custom fur salon in Newport Beach last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Fur has always been Kiszely's passion. A fourth-generation furrier from a 
family originally from Tiszafured, Hungary, Kiszely knows all about choosing 
the skins, fitting the customer and sewing the pieces together. He loves the 
feel of the fur and the way it moves in a garment. 
</P>
<P>
But what he really wants to do is make something he can sit on. 
</P>
<P>
For the last few years, he has been designing and creating handcrafted throw 
pillows, beds, chairs and ottomans out of sheared mink, beaver and other furs. 
The prices for the pieces, from about $12,500 to $25,000 (for an oversized 
ottoman in sheared champagne mink), keep them well out of reach for most 
buyers. In fact, he has sold only two. 
</P>
<P>
So Kiszely makes coats. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging in his Exclusifurs shop on Westcliff Drive are about two dozen styles 
he has been creating for the new season: several full-length, champagne-colored 
mink coats, a pale sheared mink short men's jacket and a dusty rose jacket made 
out of French rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
These are not the kinds of coats mama wore. They are high-styled wraps with 
leather trims, wild silk floral linings and rich, daring colors. Kiszely 
describes his collection as high fashion yet classical. He says this season's 
fur styles are unconstructed, untailored and versatile. 
</P>
<P>
"The look in fur now is a very easy look," says the 39-year-old Laguna Hills 
resident. "They're comfortable, loose and generously cut. Five to 10 years ago 
it was more streamlined and tailored. The new look is wide and fluid." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the styles are designed to be worn either with blue jeans or formal 
wear, appealing to the young, diamonds-with-denim set. The coats are short 
(knee-length is the most popular) and casual, like the new breed of fur buyer. 
</P>
<P>
The buying age for fur is getting younger and younger, according to Kiszely, 
who says he recently designed a mink for a 2-year-old. "Part of it is just the 
way that fashion goes, and right now it's fashionable. . . . I'm carrying some 
designs for teen-agers, and for them, you can't charge a lot, so I'll do 
leather and fur combinations and have some for $1,500." 
</P>
<P>
Another big look this year is shearling -- lambskin -- often in brilliant 
colors. This short-napped fur is cropping up in collars, sleeves and linings 
and is a hot look for the young and fashion-conscious, says Kiszely. 
</P>
<P>
But throughout the seasons, natural-colored dark mink in a traditionally styled 
coat is always the biggest seller. Kiszely's mink prices range from about 
$3,000 to $21,000 and take from four to six weeks to order if custom-made. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszely, who hails from Washington state, where his family is still in the fur 
business, says Southern California is one of the best markets for furs. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly because there are so many people in the high-income bracket," he says. 
"But also because they are very well traveled. They go to Europe and New York 
every winter, and they need furs as just a practicality. And also because there 
are so many fashion-conscious people here." 
</P>
<P>
He says many of his customers have more than one fur. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not satisfied with having one mink coat," he says, "so they buy a 
jacket or a fun fur, something out of fox." 
</P>
<P>
Kiszely says he is not greatly disturbed by the protests of animal-rights 
activists, who think that wearing animal skins is cruel and immoral. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, for the most part, they are misinformed," he says. "I mean, they 
think raising silkworms is cruel. . . . But some of the activists have brought 
about good changes in the industry. Animals are trapped more humanely than they 
used to be; they are killed more quickly. And they have called attention to the 
use of endangered species (by the fur industry) in other countries, which is 
also a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
But Kiszely says many animal-rights groups don't realize that United States 
furriers do not use endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a plentiful number of animals out there, and if they weren't 
cultivated, they would overpopulate and wreak more havoc," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszely says his interest in making furniture out of fur, which he calls 
furniture, is a natural extension of his love for animal skins. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think fur, especially mink, is such a wonderful fabric. Why not bring 
it into the home? Why limit it to something you wear?" 
</P>
<P>
He says that if he could afford to, he would have fur pieces in his own home. 
"Why not put it someplace you can see it and feel it all the time?" 
</P>

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: WRITERS SEMINAR BEGAN AS A 'DRUNKEN EVENING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oakley Hall remembers spending many a "drunken evening" sitting around with 
fellow novelist Blair Fuller in a Squaw Valley summer home in the late '60s 
talking about starting a writers conference. 
</P>
<P>
Those libation-inspired evenings gave birth to the Squaw Valley Writers 
Community, a weeklong writers conference in the Sierra Nevada ski resort where 
writers spend from morning until night attending writing workshops and mingling 
with successful authors, editors and agents. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty writers showed up for the first installment of the annual literary event, 
gleaning tips on fiction writing from the likes of Herb Gold, Max Steele, 
Barnaby Conrad, Blair and Hall, who is director of the graduate and 
undergraduate writing programs at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
That was the Woodstock summer of 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Squaw Valley Writers Community has become a highly 
respected literary event, serving as a powerful magnet for a number of writers 
who have gone on to literary fame and glory: Richard Ford, Anne Rice, Amy Tan, 
Michael Chabon of Laguna Beach and Jay Gummerman of San Clemente, to name a 
few. 
</P>
<P>
This week, as the Squaw Valley Valley Writers Community celebrates its 20th 
anniversary, 115 writers are participating in the fiction program (20 of them 
from Orange County) and 16 in the screen-writing program. To accommodate the 54 
poets who were accepted at the conference this year, the poetry program for the 
first time was held separately in July. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we ever anticipated (lasting) 20 years," said Hall before the 
start of the conference last Saturday. "I've been directing it for the last 
five or six years and really co-directing it before that -- and complaining all 
the way. It's not that the work is so much, but the worry is, is the staff 
going to show up?" 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who happily reported this week that "everybody showed up," describes this 
year's 27-member fiction staff as "the best we've had." 
</P>
<P>
Among the more well-known names are novelists Robert Stone, Michael Chabon and 
Kem Nunn of Huntington Beach. Also: short-story writer Ethan Canin, New Yorker 
writer Bill Barich and San Francisco Examiner columnist Cyra McFadden. That's 
not to mention a handful of literary agents and editors, who also run 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members and guests in the screen-writing program include Academy Award 
winners Jeremy Larner ("The Candidate") and Frank Pierson ("Dog Day 
Afternoon"). 
</P>
<P>
This year the poetry program was taught by Pulitzer Prize winner Galway 
Kinnell, Sharon Olds, Robert Hass and Brenda Hillman. Unlike the writers in the 
fiction and screen-writing programs who bring manuscripts and screen 
plays-in-progress with them for workshop critiquing, the participating poets 
are required to write while they are there. 
</P>
<P>
"They write every day and present it the next morning," Hall said. "There's a 
lot of pressure on them. They whine and cry a lot, but apparently some 
remarkable results are had." 
</P>
<P>
With so many agents and publishing house representatives in attendance, making 
valuable contacts is a goal of many of the participants. In fact, Hall said, 
his own agent, Don Congdon, attends just to read manuscripts and talk to the 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary purpose (of the conference) is to make people make a better 
manuscript," Hall said. "But the whole networking thing -- making contacts -- 
is certainly of importance." 
</P>
<P>
The Squaw Valley Writers Community is where first-time novelist Robert Ferrigno 
met Del Mar literary agent Sandra Dijkstra last summer. The former Orange 
County Register feature writer later sent her a copy of his incomplete 
manuscript, and Dijkstra wound up landing him a $150,000 advance with William 
Morrow/Avon. And Ferrigno wasn't even a conference participant. He was there as 
a free-lance journalist doing a piece for the Register. (In the prophetic last 
line of his article, Ferrigno wrote: "A good time was had by all. Someone might 
even get famous.") 
</P>
<P>
In order to attend the conference, writers are required to submit a couple of 
short stories or pieces of a novel. Novelist Carolyn Doty, who runs the fiction 
program, reads the submissions and selects those who will attend. The cost for 
the entire week, including evening meals and housing in rented condominiums, 
private houses and cabins, is $450. 
</P>
<P>
While saying they like to see "some evidence of talent or seriousness of 
purpose" in applicants' writing, Hall said, "I don't want to be too 
discriminatory because I think it's good for beginners." 
</P>
<P>
Participants spend mornings in workshops, which are limited to 12 students 
each. Manuscripts are copied and distributed in advance and, over the course of 
the week, each writer's manuscript will be examined in the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Afternoon sessions, which are held in the ski lodge bar, are devoted to "open 
workshops," talks and panel discussions on editing, publishing and agents. In 
the evenings, it's back to the bar for more of the same, including formal 
readings and viewings of film clips, with discussions, by the guest 
screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
The conference culminates tonight with what has come to be known as "The 
Follies," an informal revue in which literary types let their hair down and 
sing, do skits and play musical instruments. In this case, talent is not 
required, but it doesn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hall: "When I called up Ethan Canin I said I need a terrific short story 
writer who plays B tennis and plays a musical instrument." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach author Lee Ezell was a guest on the "Geraldo" talk show last 
week, which devoted an hour to the subject of children born of rape. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell, who lectures around the country on the subject of how to improve 
personal relationships, is the author of "The Missing Piece," published by 
Bantam last fall. The "missing piece" in her life is her 25-year-old daughter, 
Julie Makimaa, whom she gave up for adoption. Ezell said she had just turned 18 
when she was raped by a salesman for the San Francisco company where she 
worked. "He was gone the next morning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she and her daughter "got our first look at each other" four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She searched for me 3 1/2 years and actually she did not know she was the 
result of rape," said Ezell, whose husband, Harold Ezell, is the recently 
retired INS Western regional commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Julie and Julie's adoptive mother, Eileen Anderson, who live in Michigan, also 
appeared on "Geraldo" with Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tickled to be able to show from our perspective that something 
beautiful can actually be made out of something so horrible," she said. "What 
really began as an unplanned pregnancy doesn't necessarily have to result in an 
unwanted child. As a birth mother I gave up my child for adoption because I 
felt it was the best thing I could do for a child." 
</P>
<P>
Although she considered having an abortion, Ezell said doing so at the time 
meant crossing the border to Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only grateful it was not an easy thing for me to have an abortion, and 
when I really considered it carefully I came to the conclusion: Why should a 
child be punished for the crime of a father?" she said.

Whether hiking in the hills, running through the surf or simply kicking back to 
watch the sunset, Orange County teen-agers have their favorite places for 
beautiful views.

HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE, DISCIPLINE MARK JUNIOR LIFEGUARD PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

contributor to High Life.

<P>
Sun, beach, surf, education and discipline. An unlikely combination, indeed, 
but add 16 dedicated instructors and 700 enthusiastic boys and girls ages 9 to 
17 and you've got the Huntington Beach Summer Junior Lifeguard Program. 
</P>
<P>
Tryouts are held the last two weeks of May and the first weeks of June at the 
Fountain Valley High School swimming pool. But the only vacancies are left by 
those participants who do not return from the previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
The physical requirement for new members is to swim 100 yards in under 1 1/2 
minutes. The cost of participating in the eight-week program is $140. This 
summer's 700 junior lifeguards are divided into two groups -- the morning and 
afternoon -- and their lessons last four hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The fee pays for equipment, instructors' salaries and about half the cost of 
the trips they take during the summer, according to Mike Eich, the program's 
assistant coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"We have five instructors who are full-time teachers, two who are studying for 
law degrees , and one engineer," said Eich, himself a science teacher at 
Fountain Valley High. "It's a successful program and a lot of professional 
people recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the golden programs of the city of Huntington Beach. The City 
Council backs us 100% every year." 
</P>
<P>
The junior lifeguard program was started in 1962, with 30 students -- all boys. 
In 1971, girls were allowed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Eich, who was in the program during the summers of 1968 and '69, explained: 
"When I first started teaching in the program, our attitude was, 'We have 700 
people we (the lifeguards) don't have to worry about.' Now it's built itself up 
so much that it's paying itself back." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 75% of all Huntington Beach lifeguards are alumni of the Huntington 
Beach Junior Lifeguard Program. 
</P>
<P>
"This (lifeguard instruction) is something that I take a lot of pride in," said 
Eich, who has been involved in lifeguard training for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the program's aims, Eich said: "Our primary concern is ocean safety. 
Second, we teach first aid and CPR. In addition, we place importance on good 
sportsmanship and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
The program is divided into three age divisions: A, ages 14 to 17; B, ages 12 
and 13, and C, ages 9 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
The A division is composed of three subdivisions. The first is made up of high 
school students who are in their first year of training or who are involved 
merely for social reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The second is for those with program experience but who were unable to become 
lifeguards for one reason or another. They serve as safety aides to the younger 
students. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the captains, those students who are future lifeguards. This 
elite group of 10 boys and 10 girls is a dedicated one. 
</P>
<P>
Junior lifeguards must pass the first aid, CPR and lifeguarding tests at a 
higher level to be ranked captains. They must pass several endurance tests, 
such as swimming around the Huntington Beach Pier three times and running six 
miles in a combined time of less than an hour and 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Another test is the Laguna Run. Here, junior guards combine running and 
swimming from Aliso Pier in Laguna Beach to the Huntington Beach Pier. There is 
no time limit -- they just need to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Eich works us really hard, but he makes it fun," said Kelli Quinn, a 
15-year-old sophomore from Tustin High who is spending her fifth summer in the 
program and first as a captain. 
</P>
<P>
David Prior, 16, agreed. The instructors are strict, he said, "but they also 
have a good sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll use lifeguarding to pay for college and then decide what I want to do for 
a living." 
</P>
<P>
Prior, a junior at Fountain Valley High, has been a junior lifeguard for seven 
years. This is his second year as a captain. 
</P>
<P>
"People have 'pre-thoughts' about female lifeguards. But I think girls can do 
anything guys can do," said 17-year-old Amy Martin, who is spending her eighth 
year as a junior lifeguard and second as a captain. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a captain offers a number of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Captains can spend a weekend at USC's Marine Biological Institute on Santa 
Catalina and study marine life. 
</P>
<P>
There are also the educational exchange programs during winter vacation. In 
these, 16 junior lifeguards live in either New Zealand, Australia or New South 
Wales for 2 1/2 weeks. There, they participate in those countries' summer 
junior lifeguard programs. In turn, foreign lifeguards spend time in Huntington 
Beach during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"In most countries, they don't pay their lifeguards, so the quality is 
different (from the American lifeguarding standards)," Eich said. "A lot of 
times, coming to America and seeing our lifeguards is a real eye-opener for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Next summer, Eich plans to have 20 junior guards and two instructors attend the 
World Lifesaving Conference to be held in Germany. The two-week conference will 
have representatives from 21 different countries. 
</P>
<P>
Citing other pluses of the program was second-year captain Bryan Walker, a 
17-year-old senior from Ocean View High. "We learn to work with each other and 
together," said Walker, who is five summers into the program. "It's got to do 
with being proud, being honorable and learning to respect others." 
</P>
<P>
Respect and discipline play a major role in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, one of the most attractive aspects of the program to a lot 
of the kids is the discipline," Eich said. "As a professional teacher, I 
learned that as long as we are fair and tough, students thrive on it." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Judkins, a 16-year-old junior from Marina High, talked about the discipline 
system. "You can't say 'yeah,' 'nope,' 'naaa,' 'uh-uh,' or (use) any other 
slang," he said. The penalty is 25 push-ups during the first week and 25 more 
for every week that follows. The penalty also holds for tardiness and 
dress-code violations. 
</P>
<P>
"Six weeks into the program and not one of the captains was ever late," Eich 
said. "The program is discipline-oriented and fun-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
And the discipline is not one-sided; the push-up penalty for slang applies to 
instructors as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who come this far (to the rank of captain) want to become a 
lifeguard," said Judkins, a five-summer veteran and into his second summer as a 
captain. "You don't come this far and then just quit." 
</P>
<P>
Why a lifeguard? 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I just wanted to do for a long time. I like being down here and 
I like helping people," said Judkins, who hopes to be a police officer someday, 
explaining that "law enforcement is a part of lifeguarding."

SERIAL KILLER RANDY KRAFT SHOULD DIE IN GAS CHAMBER, JURY RECOMMENDS

"Score card killer" Randy Kraft should die in the gas chamber for his 
two-decade spree of sexual violence and mutilation that left at least 16 young 
men and boys dead, a jury decided today. 
</P>
<P>
The jury had convicted Kraft of 16 murders May 12. They began deliberations 
Wednesday on the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin will sentence Kraft on 
Oct 27. He can reduce the punishment to life imprisonment. A death sentence 
will automatically be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict follows months of grisly testimony about the deaths, which took 
place from 1972 to 1983. Kraft, a 44-year-old computer consultant, picked up 
hitchhikers, disabled them by plying them with drugs and alcohol, sexually 
tortured and mutilated them, and then strangled them, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 murder convictions are one of the nation's biggest killing rampages, but 
prosecutors contend that they are fewer than half of Kraft's bloody legacy. He 
has been linked to at least 21 other slayings in California, Oregon and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
A so-called "death list" in Kraft's car, which prosecutors say contains coded 
references to his victims, led Kraft to be dubbed the "score card killer." 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested May 14, 1983, when Highway Patrol officers pulled him over for 
erratic driving and discovered a strangled Marine in the car.

The Shiite Muslim suicide bomber who wounded five Israeli soldiers in south 
Lebanon said in a videotape released today that his dream had been to kill 
British author Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had executed the death sentence of the hypocrite agent Salman 
Rushdie, fulfilling the edict of Imam Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but God 
graced me with the operation against Israel," Asaad Berro said in his 
videotaped final testament. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini died in June four months after ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie for 
blaspheming Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses." Several pro-Iranian groups 
in Lebanon said they would carry out the command.

Space scientists struggled today to try to correct the orbit of a $316-million 
European satellite launched earlier this week after the engine that adjusts its 
height refused to fire for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for satellite builders Matra said the Hipparcos's apogee engine had 
failed this morning. Technicians were working to locate the problem, and 
another two attempts would be made this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Hipparcos, the result of 20 years work by the European Space Agency, is 
designed to measure distance between stars and provide astronomers with 
invaluable information about the structure of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
An Ariane space rocket launched the satellite into elliptical orbit Tuesday, 
but to function properly it needs to move into an elliptical orbit well away 
from Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
A Matra spokesman said that if the apogee engine could not be repaired, a 
weaker motor meant for minute adjustments to the satellite's position in space 
would be activated.

Luckless giant panda Ling-Ling has aborted a fetus the size of a postage stamp, 
but panda watchers at Washington's National Zoo held out hope today for a live 
birth possibly within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo spokesman Bob Hoage said a fetus weighing less than a gram was found by a 
keeper Thursday. A zoo pathologist said the fetus was in a very early stage of 
development and was aborted spontaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Hoage said since pandas have twins 60% of the time, it was still possible 
Ling-Ling could give birth perhaps by mid-September if there is another fetus 
and if the normal gestation period of roughly 97 to 168 days runs its course. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old panda, along with 19-year-old male panda Hsing-Hsing, are the 
only two pandas permanently on display in the United States.

Tens of thousands of bus drivers, shipbuilders, dockhands and factory workers 
in Gdansk province stopped work for an hour today to demand higher pay and a 
halt to Communist Party influence on factory management.

It was Solidarity's first general strike since it regained legal status in 
April and was hailed as "exceptionally successful" by veteran organizer Bogdan 
Borusewicz. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity estimated that more than 200,000 workers took part, many of them 
signing up as members in the independent union whose slow growth since its 
legalization has disappointed activists. "Even those enterprises where 
Solidarity is weak went on strike," Borusewicz said.

Sweden said today that it has expelled a Soviet consular official for

<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the man, who worked for the Soviet consular mission 
in the western port of Gothenburg, has left Sweden. It did not reveal his name 
or position. 
</P>
<P>
"He engaged in activity incompatible with his duties and attempted to get 
information about Swedish and foreign technology," a ministry official said. He 
said the man's activity had not harmed Sweden but might have if it had been 
allowed to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Swedish relations with the Soviet Union have been strained by recent Swedish 
allegations that its Moscow embassy was bugged as well as longstanding concerns 
that Soviet submarines routinely violate Swedish territorial waters.

3 GET 16-, 20-YEAR, LIFE SENTENCES FOR DEFACING BEIJING PORTRAIT OF MAO

A Chinese court imposed prison sentences of life, 20 years and 16 years on 
three men who flung ink and paint on the giant portrait of the late ruler Mao 
Zedong in Beijing's Tian An Men Square during anti-government unrest in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Evening News said the capital's Intermediate Court found Yu 
Zhijian, Yu Dongyue and Lu Decheng from south China's Hunan Province guilty of 
"counterrevolutionary destruction and counterrevolutionary incitement." 
</P>
<P>
The prison terms are among the few court sentences Chinese authorities have 
announced since the bloody military crackdown June 3 and 4 and subsequent 
arrests of thousands of anti-government protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The three pasted "reactionary posters" on the Gate of Heavenly Peace at the 
north end of the giant square before throwing paint-filled eggshells and an ink 
bottle at Mao's portrait May 23, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
"They used the turmoil in Beijing as an opportunity to put up reactionary 
posters, make reactionary speeches . . . and brazenly carried out 
counterrevolutionary destruction on Tian An Men Square," it quoted the court as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Their actions constitute . . . counterrevolutionary destruction and 
counterrevolutionary incitement. They must be severely punished," it added. 
</P>
<P>
The three, described in earlier reports as a primary schoolteacher, a newspaper 
arts editor and a transport company worker, were seized by student democracy 
activists then filling Tian An Men Square and handed over to police after 
defacing the picture. 
</P>
<P>
National television showed the three men standing impassively as court 
officials read out their sentences. Yu Zhijian was jailed for life, Yu Dongyue 
for 20 years and Lu 16. 
</P>
<P>
Mao's portrait has hung since the 1950s from the Gate of Heavenly Peace at the 
entrance to the Forbidden City, the ancient imperial palace complex in the 
center of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
A sign reading, "This Was Not Done by Students or the People," appeared below 
the defaced portrait and student leaders condemned the action. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities quickly replaced the painting with an identical, undamaged one. 
</P>
<P>
The attack went against the grain of a limited revival of Mao's memory during 
the weeks of unrest, when some workers on protest marches carried his portrait 
in the first such public display of devotion to him in the capital in a decade.

A former United Mine Workers official serving life in prison for his role in 
the 1969 slayings of union dissident Joseph (Jock) Yablonski and his family has 
died in his cell, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
William Prater was found at 6:10 a.m. today at the State Correctional 
Institution in Luzerne County. A prison spokesman said Prater, who was 70, 
apparently died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
Prater was sentenced in 1973 and was serving three life sentences for the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
Yablonski, 59, was shot to death along with his wife, Margaret, 57, and their 
25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, at their Clarksville, Pa., home on New Year's 
Eve in 1969. Yablonski had lost an election for UMW president earlier that 
December. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, then-incumbent UMW president, W. A. (Tony) Boyle, was later 
convicted of ordering the assassination.

The second test flight of the controversial B-2 Stealth bomber could take place 
as early as Saturday at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the Air Force 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"The exact date of the flight will not be pre-announced but is presently 
scheduled to take place within a five-day time frame beginning Saturday," the 
Air Force said. 
</P>
<P>
The radar-evading bomber -- at $530 million a copy the most expensive warplane 
ever built -- successfully completed its maiden flight July 17. 
</P>
<P>
The bat-like aircraft took off from the Northrop Corp.'s assembly plant in 
Palmdale and soared across the Mojave Desert at 10,000 feet for two hours 
before landing at Edwards, 25 miles from Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
The bomber was partially taken apart for analysis and inspection at Edwards 
after the flight and put back together.

EASTERN HALTS EFFORT TO HIRE NEW PILOTS

Eastern Airlines today stopped hiring new pilots, saying it had enough for its 
rebuilding effort after the last week's sudden surge in picket-line crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Robin Matell said Eastern canceled training classes next week for its 
newest recruits and will also stop advertising for pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern filed for Bankruptcy Court reorganization five days after being hit by 
a crippling strike by its pilots, flight attendants and machinists unions March 
4. The company has undertaken plans to rebuild to two-thirds its prestrike 
size. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
800 Daily Flights 
</P>
<P>
In its bankruptcy reorganization plan, Eastern indicated that it would be 
flying 800 daily flights with 1,700 pilots by year's end. Eastern now has 350 
daily flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Eastern could hire and train enough new pilots has been a major 
question about the plan to rebuild. The company this month leased five planes 
and crews from sister carrier Continental Airlines to help meet schedule 
expansion goals. 
</P>
<P>
Matell declined to give figures on Eastern's pilots, but sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity have said more than 600 union pilots are flying, 
including about 250 who have crossed picket lines since the union leadership 
last weekend discussed ending the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has graduated 300 newly hired pilots from training and has between 700 
and 800 in training. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran pilots who want to return to work will be put on "a preferential recall 
list" and given priority for future openings, Matell said. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Weber, spokesman for Eastern's Air Line Pilots Assn., was skeptical about 
whether Eastern has hired enough qualified pilots but said today's announcement 
would stop the flow of pilot crossovers.

<P>
Japan's trade surplus shrank 16.5% in July to $5.99 billion, the government 
said today, pressured by brisk Japanese domestic demand, lagging U.S. economic 
growth and a stronger dollar. 
</P>
<P>
While the July figures were somewhat exaggerated by a firm dollar, economists 
said the underlying trend is for smaller surpluses anyway because of a slowing 
U.S. economy and continuing robust Japanese domestic consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The July trade surplus declined from $7.18 billion a year earlier, Finance 
Ministry figures show. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus with the United States in July contracted to $3.83 billion from 
$4.49 billion a year ago.

Monetary authorities around the world sold dollars today as part of a concerted 
effort to stem a sharp surge in the U.S. currency, senior banking sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But the dollar still managed to hold on to gains against major foreign 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Central banks decided to intervene after the dollar failed to weaken, as 
expected, in reaction to what should have been negative figures for the dollar, 
said a market source, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell briefly after the release in Washington of unexpected news on 
the U.S. producer price index for July but almost immediately rebounded on 
renewed buying interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewed Auto Buying 
</P>
<P>
The news that the inflation index fell 0.4% would normally have been bearish 
for the dollar because it implies that an easing of interest rates may be at 
hand. The market had expected producer prices to be up only 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
A separate report on U.S. retail sales helped alleviate some recession fears. 
Retail sales, paced by renewed spending on autos, rebounded 0.9% in July after 
posting their first back-to-back monthly declines since early 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A string of European central banks including West Germany's Bundesbank, the 
Bank of England and banks of Belgium, Italy and Switzerland were among those 
selling dollars. The U.S. Federal Reserve also sold dollars, currency dealers 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Several central banks, such as the Bundesbank, confirmed their actions that 
were first reported by currency dealers. The Fed's policy is not to comment on 
market reports of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.5940 to buy 
one pound, compared with $1.5988 at mid-morning and $1.6280 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 1.05 yen to a closing 140.10 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a 
higher rate of 141.50 yen versus 141.05 yen before the intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Selected dollar rates at mid-afternoon, with morning rates in parentheses and 
compared with late Thursday's rate, included: 1.9285 (1.9230) West German 
marks, up from 1.8905; 1.6615 (1.6612) Swiss francs, up from 1.6325; 6.5025 
(6.4965) French francs, up from 6.3955; 2.1860 (2.1608) Dutch guilders, up from 
2.1275; 1,388.00 (1,382.00) Italian lire, up from 1,356.75; and, 1.1720

MERRILL LYNCH SELLS REALTY OPERATIONS TO PRUDENTIAL

Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said today it will sell its residential real estate 
operations to the Prudential Insurance Co. of America for more than $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, which includes Merrill Lynch Realty, a residential broker with 
18,000 sales representatives in 450 offices nationwide, will not have a 
significant effect on Merrill Lynch's net earnings, the company said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement marks the final stroke of a divestiture that began four years 
ago when Merrill Lynch moved to focus on its core broker-dealer businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch said it will spend about $140 million to buy back publicly traded 
units of the Fine Homes Limited Partnership at $18 a piece before the 
partnership can be sold to Prudential. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage formed Fine Homes, a master limited partnership, to run its 
residential real estate operations after an unsuccessful attempt to sell the 
operations outright. It was reported that Merrill Lynch had hoped to reap at 
least $500 million from such a sale, which would have included a residential 
mortgage business that was eliminated in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Merrill Lynch sold a minority interest in Fine Homes to the public in 
late 1986. The brokerage retains a 74% interest in the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"This transaction culminates Merrill Lynch's divestiture of a business, which, 
while profitable, is not part of our long-term global strategy," William A.

Cal State Fresno plans to install luxury "sky suites" that will cost users up 
to $30,000 a year as part of an expansion of the school's football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The 34 sky suites would seat up to 20 people each or a total of 680 of those 
who will fill the nearly 14,000 new seats that would increase the capacity of 
Bulldog Stadium to about 44,000. Cost of the sky suites would range from 
$10,000 to $30,000, with the highest-priced ones closest to the 50-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
If the sky boxes are built, they would be among the few in the nation at a 
college stadium, Scott Johnson, Fresno State's sports information officer, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty much found on the pro level," Johnson said.

PETE ROSE WON'T FIGHT RELEASE OF BETTING SLIPS;

LAWYER SAYS REDS MANAGER DIDN'T WRITE WAGER SHEETS; TEAM ASKS TO BE DISMISSED 
FROM SUIT

An attorney for Pete Rose said today he will not object if a federal judge 
orders the FBI to release betting sheets allegedly written by Rose as well as 
the Cincinnati Reds manager's fingerprint records. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti asked U.S. District Judge John 
Holschuh to release the records Thursday. Federal privacy laws require Holschuh 
to order their release, the motion said. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI in Cincinnati has the documents, and the bureau has no objection to 
their release, the motion said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has said he did not bet on the Reds or write the betting slips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Originals Released 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stachler, Rose's attorney, said he wants the originals released. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't object. We've been trying to get them all along," Stachler said in a 
telephone interview from his Cincinnati office. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Janszen, a former friend of Rose who says he ran bets for the Reds 
manager, has said he took the sheets from Rose's home. A handwriting expert 
hired by baseball concluded they that are in Rose's handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner wants the sheets to see if Rose's fingerprints are on the 
originals. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the Reds asked the judge to dismiss the club as co-defendant 
in Rose's suit against Giamatti. It was the club's first formal response to 
Rose's two-month search for an injunction against Giamatti, who wants to hold a 
disciplinary hearing concerning Rose's gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's suit contends that Giamatti is biased and cannot guarantee him a fair 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The motion by the Reds relied in part on a paragraph in Rose's complaint that 
said he "alleges no wrongful conduct" by the club. 
</P>
<P>
Reds attorney Robert C. Martin said given that and the tradition of allowing 
baseball to handle its own affairs, no court has jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just our feeling that . . . major league baseball has done a good job 
policing itself for the last 70 years, and I believe it should still be allowed 
to do so," Martin said today. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti wants to start disciplinary proceedings Thursday. Rose wants a second 
postponement of the hearing because Stachler is trying to get a federal appeals 
court to take the case away from Holschuh and return it to a state court in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Holschuh has set a hearing Monday to determine whether protection against 
disciplinary action should be extended. A restraining order that prohibits Rose 
from being fired or from being disciplined by baseball expires Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If Holschuh insists on Monday's hearing, Rose would have until 5 p.m. today to 
seek an emergency stay from the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Position Reiterated 
</P>
<P>
Stachler today filed a motion reiterating his position that Giamatti should not 
conduct the disciplinary hearing. The filing was in response to a motion filed 
Wednesday by baseball's attorneys, who asked Holschuh to permit Giamatti to 
proceed with the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Logic and fairness dictate that Pete Rose should be protected from the harm 
which will inexorably follow a hearing by this commissioner, and further that 
(Rose) be afforded a meaningful opportunity for review of the issue of federal 
jurisdiction," Stachler said in the motion.
