PRESIDENT OF REPUBLIC PICTURES; 
</P>
<P>
NATHAN LEVINE; PIONEER IN MOVIES 
</P>

Nathan (Nat) Levine, who parlayed a career as a distributor of early films that 
were rejected by most of the major studios into the presidency of Republic 
Pictures, is dead at age 89. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Motion Picture and Television Hospital said Friday that 
he died Sunday at the Woodland Hills facility. 
</P>
<P>
Levine began in the industry in 1920 when he launched an independent 
distributorship. Seven years later, still in his 20s, Levine formed his own 
production company, Mascot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Sound Adventure Short 
</P>
<P>
There he produced the first of what would be 500 reels of serials, including 
what is believed to be the first sound adventure short, "King of the Congo." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Herbert J. Yates, who owned Republic Film Laboratories and later 
Consolidated Film Industries, was processing film for Mascot, Monogram, Liberty 
and other small picture companies and knew that Mascot was one of the few 
independent firms making money. 
</P>
<P>
Levine was operating out of the old Mack Sennett studio in North Hollywood, 
which he purchased when Sennett went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
An additional attraction for Yates, who wanted his own studio, was that Mascot 
held contracts for such young cowboy stars as Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette 
and had used a former USC football player named John Wayne in three short 
films. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, Yates formed Republic Pictures and Levine melded Mascot Pictures into 
the Republic organization. Yates added modern recording equipment and the 
latest in sound stages to Levine's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Levine also brought to Republic the sound recording engineers, writers, 
cinematographers and special effects team that had made Mascot successful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Head of Firm 
</P>
<P>
After some disputes with Yates' original management team, Levine became head of 
the firm, bringing to the new studio his expertise in low-budget, commercially 
successful "B" features and long-running adventure serials. That twin package 
remained the backbone of Republic until it gradually quit production in the 
late 1940s, the victim of expensive, color spectacular movies from competing 
studios and the brash infant of television. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, CBS purchased the North Hollywood property in 1952 and renamed it 
Television City. 
</P>
<P>
By then Levine had been gone for years, retiring from the film industry in 
1937. His survivors include a son.

WILLIAM PRATER; JAILED FOR LIFE IN UNIONIST'S MURDER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
William Jackson Prater, a former United Mine Workers official who was serving a 
life term in prison for his role in the 1969 slayings of union dissident Joseph 
(Jock) Yablonski and his family, died in his cell Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Prater was found early in the morning at the State Correctional Institution at 
Dallas in Luzerne County. A prison spokesman said Prater, who was 70, 
apparently died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been in poor health for some time," Roy VanWhy said. Prater had been 
confined to a wheelchair since suffering a stroke in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Prater was sentenced in 1973 and was serving three life sentences for the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
Yablonski, 59, was shot to death along with his wife, Margaret, 57, and their 
25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, at their Clarksville home in southwestern 
Pennsylvania on New Year's Eve, 1969. Yablonski had lost an election for UMW 
president earlier that December. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, then-incumbent UMW President W. A. (Tony) Boyle, was later 
convicted of ordering the assassination. Boyle's first conviction was 
overturned and he was convicted a second time. He died in May, 1985, while 
serving three life terms. 
</P>
<P>
Prater, formerly of LaFollette, Tenn., was a mid-level union official accused 
of helping to plan the killing and accumulating $20,000 in union funds to pay 
the assassins. He later helped prosecutors convict Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
The three men accused of carrying out the killings, Aubran (Buddy) Martin, 
Claude Vealey and Paul Gilly, were all convicted and sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prater served 16 years in a federal prison before being paroled, but then was 
transferred to the state prison at Pittsburgh in September, 1988, to serve life 
terms imposed under state law and was moved to Dallas later that year.

SHIITE BOMBER'S DREAM WAS TO KILL AUTHOR RUSHDIE

<P>
The Shiite Muslim suicide bomber who wounded five Israeli soldiers in south 
Lebanon said in a videotape released Friday his dream had been to kill British 
author Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had executed the death sentence of the hypocrite agent Salman 
Rushdie, fulfilling the edict of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but God 
graced me with the operation against Israel," said Sheik Assad Birro in his 
videotaped final testament. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini died in June four months after ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie for 
blaspheming Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses." Several pro-Iranian 
groups in Lebanon said they would carry out the command. 
</P>
<P>
Birro, who died in the attack, urged "all strugglers" to find out where Rushdie 
was and kill him. The author has been hiding since Khomeini's edict, which 
caused outrage in the West and led to the breaking of diplomatic ties between 
Britain and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Truck With Explosives 
</P>
<P>
The videotape was distributed by Hezbollah (Party of God), which claimed 
responsibility for Wednesday's attack in which Birro drove a truck rigged with 
explosives into an Israeli army convoy patrolling a buffer zone in southern 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said the attack was to avenge Israel's abduction of a prominent 
pro-Iranian cleric, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, from his home in southern Lebanon 
on July 28.

RED SOX ARE GETTING A HEEP OF DANNY'S HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guess who is getting two and three hits per game for one of the best hitting 
teams in baseball, the Boston Red Sox. Danny Heep. 
</P>
<P>
Heep was one of the Dodgers' leading hitters in spring training last year, but 
when the bell rang, Tommy Lasorda benched him. Then when all other Dodger 
outfielders went down with injuries, Lasorda had no other choice, so for a 
month Heep was the regular right fielder and among the team's leading hitters. 
</P>
<P>
When Lasorda's beloved .200 hitters recovered from injuries, he benched Heep 
again and counted the minutes until Heep would be released at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The moral is clear: Lasorda has patience galore with .200 hitters, but if you 
hit .350 it's so long, farewell, goodby.

PLAYERS OF TODAY ARE PENNY-WISE, NOT WIMPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Downey left out a very important fact in his Aug. 8 column. 
</P>
<P>
He is right in saying that today's players are in better shape than those of 
the 1940s and '50s. And he is also right in saying that the players of 
yesterday played everyday, even when they had broken hip bones. 
</P>
<P>
But he left out was the reason. Today's players receive their million-dollar 
contracts on their statistics at the end of the year. That's all the cheap 
owners look at today. So if a player hits .300, but in only 100 games, he is 
considered a better asset than a player who would have hit .300, but instead 
opted to play hurt, thus his average dropped to .265. 
</P>
<P>
I don't blame today's players. I wouldn't play either. It's bad enough to play 
hurt, and risk further injury, but it's even worse if the effort is not 
appreciated.

AL MARTINEZ: TEARS AND TAXES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The white woman with an office in Brentwood and a $1.5-million home in the 
south of France was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
The black man with a business in South-Central L.A. and a lifetime of hard work 
behind him was in a rage. 
</P>
<P>
"They're driving me crazy," the woman said, wiping her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked like hell for what I have and I want to keep it," the man said, 
trying to control his anger. 
</P>
<P>
The woman has spent $190,000 in legal fees trying to straighten out a mess that 
probably shouldn't have existed in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The man has paid a bill twice that he probably shouldn't have had to pay the 
second time and is still being harassed for payment. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Wonderful World of an IRS Audit. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has ever had his taxes audited knows it's a lousy place to be. 
</P>
<P>
Mere receipt of the letter evokes images of criminal charges, federal prison, 
homosexual rape, an escape attempt, a shoot-out, capture and additional time 
behind bars, plus interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that imaginary scenario years of harassment and confusion and you have 
the reality of what has befallen two people I write about today. 
</P>
<P>
Their names are Linda Peck and Nathaniel Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
I mention their colors and their economic positions only to acknowledge that 
the Internal Revenue Service is anything but racist or class-conscious in its 
seek-and-destroy missions. Any target will do. 
</P>
<P>
Both Peck and Mullins were audited in 1984. Peck, 50, the divorced wife of 
wealthy builder Clair Peck, was in France when notified by the IRS. Mullins was 
working in his real estate office on West Florence Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Far from poor, Peck was living off a $2-million divorce settlement. She also 
once owned a flower shop and was abroad in '84 researching a television 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought 'no big deal,' " she said when notified of the audit. "I had 40 
boxes full of records and told my bookkeeper to give them what they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Mullins, 68, has been a real estate broker for 30 years and describes himself 
as "a hard-working, middle-class person." He was told right off that he owed 
$65,000 for a five-year period, which included the year 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He sighed, blamed an incompetent ex-bookkeeper, mortgaged his home and paid the 
$65,000 in full. That's what a good citizen does. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the IRS thanked him by saying he owed $5,000 for 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins explained that he had already paid what he owed for '78, and an IRS 
accountant said all right, in that case the government would settle for $2,800. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins argued but finally paid the $2,800 to get them off his back, and was 
assured that he was even with the board. 
</P>
<P>
He had hardly finished sighing with relief when the IRS said greetings, you owe 
$1,600 for 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency was demanding more and more documentation from Linda 
Peck. She returned from France, prepared volumes of material for them and was 
so effective that the auditor found a $25,000 error in her favor. 
</P>
<P>
She was sent a refund check, which she promptly returned toward her next year's 
taxes, which the IRS promptly lost. This caused more confusion and, for a time, 
the threat of attaching her bank account. 
</P>
<P>
About now, the first auditor disappeared and a new auditor assumed his duties. 
Everything started all over. Mounds of documents became mountains, months 
became years. 
</P>
<P>
"I never have found out what they want," Peck said in a Brentwood office she 
leases for $1,700 a month just to handle the audit. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the auditor to lunch twice, hoping he'd reach some sort of conclusion, 
but he hasn't. I'd move in with him if I thought it would help." 
</P>
<P>
Even high-priced lawyers in L.A. and Houston have been unable to determine 
precisely what the problem is, if any. 
</P>
<P>
"If they'd issue a legitimate tax bill," Peck said, sobbing, "I'd pay it and 
get on with my life. I can't even protest, because they won't tell me how much 
they want!" 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and two congressmen have contacted the IRS on Peck's 
behalf and she is hopeful that their muscle will bring her nightmare to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins, meanwhile, went to the Problem Resolution Department of the IRS, and 
they said they'd take care of it. They did. The $1,600 Mullins doesn't owe has 
grown to $3,029 with interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
But just last Thursday, someone from the Tax Collection Department called to 
say they were working on his case. 
</P>
<P>
With a little luck, that shouldn't cost him much more than another few thousand 
dollars, plus his home, his car and his sanity.

LIFE AND THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle being waged in a Tennessee courtroom over the fate of seven frozen 
and fertilized ova could gear up to be a national sensation along the lines of 
the "Baby M" surrogate mother case two years ago. Like the Baby M case, this 
dispute raises controversial questions concerning reproductive rights. And like 
the Baby M case, this dispute is unlikely to solve any of them. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sue Davis and her former husband, Junior Lewis Davis, wanted to have a 
child. Because Mrs. Davis could not conceive normally, the couple opted for in 
vitro fertilization -- so-called test-tube fertilization -- where egg and sperm 
are united in a laboratory and surgically implanted in the woman's uterus. Part 
of the way through this process, after fertilization and before implantation of 
seven of the fertilized eggs, the marriage fell apart and the couple decided to 
divorce. Mrs. Davis now wants to gain possession of the embryos, hoping to use 
them to have a child in the future. Mr. Davis doesn't want her to bear his 
children without his consent. 
</P>
<P>
The case raises many larger questions: Does Mr. Davis have the same rights over 
the embryos as Mrs. Davis because their genetic contribution was equal? Or does 
Mrs. Davis have greater rights because she can put the embryos to use and Mr. 
Davis cannot? Or do the rights of the parents shrink in comparison to the 
rights of the embryos who, as potential human beings, have been accorded full 
legal status in some states? 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who has said repeatedly that this case has no direct legal 
precedents, has several avenues of response. One is to consider the case as a 
standard divorce case and the embryos as any other piece of marital property. 
Another would be to follow the reasoning of a California appellate court that 
ruled last year that persons who give biological material to medical 
institutions retain rights over that material. In that case, Mr. Davis would 
retain at least equal right over the embryos. Finally, the judge could turn to 
law concerning custody of children in divorce cases, determining what decision 
would be in the "best interests" of the Davises' potential children. 
</P>
<P>
The answers to such questions have enormous implications for reproductive 
ethics. Should the judge decide that the well-being of the embryos supersedes 
the claims of both adults, that would raise questions about the morality of 
abortion. If the father is granted some say in the fate of the embryos, then 
that would raise larger issues about paternal consent for abortion and the 
rights of sperm donors. If the mother is accorded full powers over the embryos, 
the ruling would raise questions about fathers' parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
But although this case raises such sweeping questions, it is unlikely to 
resolve them. In the Baby M case, the judge resorted to straight contract law 
to make his ruling. Similarly, the Davises are likely to reach a satisfactory 
legal solution that sidesteps the moral issues -- Mr. Davis could relinquish 
all future rights or responsibilities over any children born from the embryos, 
for instance, and Mrs. Davis would gain control over the embryos in return for 
giving up the right to ask her former husband for child support. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the judge does not grant the embryos legal status -- which would go 
far beyond existing law -- this case will be just one more dispute that spurs 
public debate and reveals how deep are society's uncertainties about 
reproduction in this technologically confused era. The answers to the larger 
questions will come about only after long deliberation -- not by one nervous 
judge in one Tennessee courtroom but by society as a whole.

PART-TIME COLLEGE TEACHERS

Why didn't Gordon mention one of the main reasons that this unfair system has 
been allowed to exist, at least in the Los Angeles Community Colleges? It is a 
verifiable fact that department chairs get a considerable stipend for every 
part-timer who teaches, presumably because of the paper work involved in 
scheduling classes. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when a large department has three times as many part-timers as 
full-time teachers, the chair of that department is making (not earning) a nice 
addition to the base salary. 
</P>
<P>
As always, these inequitable matters seem to come down to a matter of 
economics.

BRADLEY'S FIGHT FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent discoveries concerning Mayor Bradley's dealings with the Far East 
Bank should be of great concern to the residents of Los Angeles (Part I, July 
26-29). Reports of rigged bidding, huge campaign contributions, whiteout of 
incriminating evidence in public records, and payments for consulting services 
while he was being paid to be a full-time mayor of Los Angeles are deeply 
troubling. Many of us are greatly troubled by the mayor's lack of candor and 
credibility. His silence in the face of an avalanche of criticism and 
accusations regarding improper dealings is disquieting. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have been at odds with the mayor over the extent and degree of 
development that should be allowed in this city. They are unhappy with his 
pro-growth stance and support of rail lines through residential communities. 
While some people may disagree on these matters, they fully expected that he 
would deal with city affairs fairly and objectively and judge them on their 
merits. 
</P>
<P>
Now, recent disclosures at council hearings make it clear that Bradley favors 
special interests at the expense of the public good. Because of these 
revelations, I believe his credibility has been damaged to the point where he 
can no longer lead this city effectively. 
</P>
<P>
I, with the concurrence of the board of directors of Homeowners of Encino, am 
therefore calling upon Bradley to resign as mayor. I respectfully ask that he 
step aside and allow someone else to give guidance and direction to this city.

PART-TIME COLLEGE TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for Gordon's article. 
</P>
<P>
I am a part-time teacher at a local community college. I am limited to nine 
hours of teaching per week at any one college; if I had more class time, the 
college would be obliged to give me benefits. Heaven forbid! 
</P>
<P>
I am single and pay no rent because I live in my grandmother's house. 
Therefore, I am able to live on my teaching income as long as financial 
emergencies don't arise. Many of my teaching colleagues, however, can only 
survive economically by becoming "freeway flyers," who spend lots of time 
traveling between teaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that, in some cases, part-time jobs might be good for some 
teachers who have full-time jobs elsewhere, who are full-time university 
students, or who have a spouse who works full time. However, many of us depend 
on our part-time teaching as our main source of income. 
</P>
<P>
For myself, I could live with the inequity in pay and the absence of job 
security, but I would desperately like to be eligible for group medical 
insurance. I think it is inexcusable that part-time teachers do not have access 
to a group medical insurance plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
As an elected official, particularly one who serves on no private boards of 
directors nor as a paid consultant to any firm, I read The Times' articles 
(Aug. 6) on Mayor Bradley with more than passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
But I should point out that The Times' list of city-provided benefits, which 
included the use of a rent-free municipal mansion in Hancock Park, omitted the 
"possessory" tax paid directly by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1850s, California has had a law that requires someone benefiting from 
the use of public property while not actually owning it to pay a possessory 
tax, which is assessed by my office. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the mayor was sent, and paid, a $1,077.44 possessory interest bill 
in lieu of a property tax. We have about 10,000 possessory assessments in 
effect throughout the county.

Regarding the article on Bradley's financial investments -- I think his 
personal business affairs are of no concern to the public. The article was mean 
and uncalled for. Bradley has made mistakes (who hasn't?), but he has done a 
good job for Los Angeles. He has many friends and supporters even if we do not 
make a lot of noise.

TRIAL ORDERED IN SLAYING OF 2 STUDIO GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former mental patient was ordered Friday to stand trial in the slayings of 
two Universal Studios guards he reportedly said God told him to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper ordered Nathan N. Trupp, 42, to stand 
trial after a one-hour preliminary hearing in which a security guard and a 
sheriff's deputy described the Dec. 1 shootings and recounted Trupp's 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Soper ordered Trupp to be arraigned Thursday on charges that he killed Jeren 
Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta and Armando Torres, 18, of Los Angeles after they 
had turned him away from Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp is also accused in the slayings of three people in a bagel shop near 
where he lived in Albuquerque, N. M., two days before the Universal Studios 
killings. The Los Angeles case will proceed first. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Trupp opened fire on the guards at Universal's main gate 
shortly after they turned him away when he asked to see actor Michael Landon. 
</P>
<P>
Abelardo Solarez, another guard, testified Friday that he saw Trupp pacing 
Lankershim Boulevard near the studio entrance. Then Trupp casually approached 
the two guards, pulled a gun and opened fire without breaking stride, Solarez 
said. The guard said Trupp shot Beeks three times and Torres once before 
walking back to Lankershim, then west on Bluffside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired a Shot 
</P>
<P>
Solarez said he began following Trupp but then saw a sheriff's car, which he 
flagged down. Deputy James Campbell said he and Solarez followed Trupp a short 
distance but when the deputy stopped the car to talk to Trupp, the suspect 
fired a shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, unhurt, threw himself to the ground and shot Trupp in the side and 
arm. Campbell and Solarez testified that as they waited for paramedics to 
arrive, Trupp repeatedly talked of the shooting and asked the guard and deputy 
to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept saying that someone sent him to kill the two guards," Solarez said. "I 
asked him who it was and he said, 'God.' 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted us to finish him off because he was in pain. He said, 'Kill me, kill 
me, it hurts.' He was crying at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Trupp was under the delusion that the victims killed in 
Albuquerque, the two guards and Landon -- star of the TV series "Highway to 
Heaven" -- all were Nazis conspiring against him. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp, who was treated at a New Jersey mental institution in 1988 and at a 
Maryland institution in the early 1970s, was originally ruled mentally 
incompetent to stand trial. However, in June a Superior Court judge held that 
treatment with drugs and therapy had restored his competency. 
</P>
<P>
In court Friday, Trupp sat calmly, handcuffed to a chair, and did not speak.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN DIES IN 2-CAR CRASH NEAR PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hawthorne woman was killed just outside Palmdale when her car veered across 
the median of the Antelope Valley Freeway and was struck by an oncoming car 
carrying a mother and her two children, the California Highway Patrol said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Susie E. Carper, 43, who was not wearing a seat belt, died at the scene early 
Thursday, CHP Officer Scott McKnight said. The occupants of the other car 
escaped serious injury because the mother wore a seat belt and her daughters 
were in back-seat child restraints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy E. Jones, 30, of Palmdale suffered facial cuts and was taken by ambulance 
to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, along with daughters Jillian, 18 months, 
and Jaycie, 4 months, McKnight said. All three were expected to be treated and 
released, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had discovered no cause for the 7:45 a.m. crash, which occurred 
in unincorporated county territory south of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Carper was headed north on the freeway toward Palmdale when her car drifted 
across the freeway's gravel median area and was struck on the driver's side by 
Jones' vehicle, McKnight said. Jones saw the oncoming car and braked but could 
not avoid the collision, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN HIT-AND-RUN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canoga Park man pleaded guilty Friday to felony hit-and-run driving in a 
bizarre incident in which another hit-and-run driver who fled on foot from a 
minor traffic collision was killed. 
</P>
<P>
A more serious charge of vehicular manslaughter against Darius B. Smith, 32, 
was dropped in return for his guilty plea to the hit-and-run charge. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann M. Korban said prosecutors agreed to the plea bargain 
because they were uncertain that they could secure a manslaughter conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Smith faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 22 in Van Nuys 
Superior Court, Korban said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith pleaded guilty in connection with the June 24 death of Saul C. Jimenez, 
29, of Woodland Hills. Police said the occupants of a car involved in a minor 
traffic accident caused by Jimenez had chased him and were wrestling with him 
when he broke away.

DODGERS PROVIDE WARMTH; 
</P>
<P>
BUT THEY PRODUCE LITTLE ELSE IN 10-2 LOSS AT CANDLESTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They usually hate the Dodgers here. The Candlestick Park fans like to heckle 
them, jeer them and fight with security guards in an attempt to pour 
inexpensive beverages on them. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, they loved them. And that should tell you all you need to know. 
</P>
<P>
A bundled-up crowd of 33,307 howled with delight through a series of misplayed 
fly balls, pop-ups, grounders and pitches as the Giants pounded the Dodgers, 
10-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night as chilly and bleak as the thought of the Dodgers needing 46 
games to finish this season. In clearly establishing the difference between a 
contender and a guy just looking for a place to get warm, the National League 
West-leading Giants stretched their lead over Houston to four games. The 
Dodgers, meanwhile, remained in fifth place, now 13 games behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers needed to sweep this three-game series to have a chance at pennant 
contention. So much for that idea. If one game can symbolize the end of a world 
champion's reign, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before, the only chance we had to stay in the race was to sweep these 
guys," Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher said. "It doesn't look good." 
</P>
<P>
Through 20 hits and 33 players, the game boiled down to two confrontations 
between Belcher and Giant third baseman Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams finished with two homers and a single-game high for his career of six 
runs batted in. Belcher finished 8-11 with a 3.51 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"He won both of them," Belcher said. "Simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, with the bases loaded, Williams hit a 2-and-2 fastball 
over the left-field fence for his second grand slam of the season. It was also 
the second grand slam that Belcher has surrendered this season. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no worse feeling in baseball than to give up a grand slam in the 
first inning in Candlestick Park . . . in a Dodger uniform," Belcher said. 
"I've never heard it so loud here. They were going nuts. I just wanted to get 
the ball and pitch to the next hitter as soon as I could to shut them up." 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. Two innings later, with a runner on first base due to a Jeff 
Hamilton error, Williams hit an 0-and-1 Belcher fastball even deeper to left 
field for a two-run homer. It gave the Giants a 6-1 lead, and after that, many 
fans never stopped hooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big rivalry here, but the interesting thing is, it's not between us and 
the Dodgers," Williams said. "It's between our fans and the Dodgers. I don't 
know how many fights I see in the stands, just people all riled up. I know for 
a pitcher it must be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 23, has three home runs against the Dodgers this year, and three 
homers in his last four at-bats, with eight homers overall. That's not bad 
considering that he has batted only 122 times this year after spending most of 
the season at triple-A Phoenix because he couldn't hit the curveball. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher thinks that this kid who may have finally entrenched himself as the 
Giants' third baseman still might not be able to hit a curveball. But Friday 
that was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"Both times, the situation called for a fastball, and he's a dead fastball 
hitter," Belcher said. "As good as he looks in one night like tonight, he can 
look bad for an entire week, because he hasn't quite learned to hit the 
breaking ball." 
</P>
<P>
So why throw him a fastball, ever? "Because I'm a dead fastball pitcher," 
Belcher said. "I got to think I can throw it harder than he can hit it. 
Tonight, I got it in bad locations both times. And he can hit the ball harder 
than Kevin Mitchell (who also homered for the Giants), Darryl Strawberry, any 
of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "It's a compliment when he says I can hit it that hard. Because 
that's all I try to do. Hit it hard." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher departed four batters after Williams' second homer, but not before he 
had loaded the bases. He had allowed a single on a pop-up that dropped between 
shortstop Alfredo Griffin and second baseman Lenny Harris. After a ground-ball 
single off his foot, Belcher walked Giant starter and winner Mike LaCoss. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Tim Crews came in but wasn't much help. The first batter he faced, 
Brett Butler, hit a two-run single. His fourth batter, Mitchell, hit a two-run 
homer in the next inning, giving him 37 homers and 102 RBIs. Will Clark had 
preceded Mitchell with a fly ball that center fielder Jose Gonzalez lost in the 
wind, the ball falling at the base of the fence for a double. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher, who gave up eight runs (five earned) in 2 2/3 innings, has had longer 
outings as a relief pitcher. It was his shortest start since he lasted 2 1/3 
innings on opening day in Cincinnati. He has given up four homers in his last 
six innings of work, and 15 homers overall this year. That figure is nearly 
twice the number yielded by Orel Hershiser (eight). 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored their runs on Griffin's RBI single in the third inning and 
Gonzalez's RBI single in the fourth. But the story of their offense was what 
could have happened but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, after pinch-hitter Billy Bean led off with a single, 
Harris moved him to second with a single. Griffin then singled to load the 
bases with none out. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Stubbs, who entered the game with a .351 average in his 19 starts this 
season, stepped up while Dodgers on the bench moved to the edge of their seats. 
But he hit the first pitch directly to LaCoss. The pitcher threw home for one 
out, and catcher Terry Kennedy threw to first base to complete the double play. 
Mike Marshall struck out looking to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arthroscopic surgery Friday revealed cartilage fragments in the right knee of 
Kal Daniels. The fragments are similar to those found in Mike Davis' knee last 
month. The fragments were removed by Dr. Frank Jobe, and Daniels will join the 
team in Philadelphia to begin rehabilitation. He probably is out for the 
season. . . . Davis, out since July 6 after surgery on both knees, could be 
swinging at live pitching this weekend for the first time since the operation. 
He is accompanying the team on its' current 12-game trip and could be ready for 
action by September. . . . Kirk Gibson's knee surgery has been postponed from 
Tuesday to Aug. 29, so Gibson's Detroit physician, Dr. Robert Tiehgie, can 
assist Jobe. Gibson did not accompany the team. . . . Catcher Rick Dempsey is 
trying something different to end his batting slump -- glasses. "I don't really 
need them, but they make things just a little clearer at night," said Dempsey, 
39, who several years ago tested but discarded contact lenses. "Who knows, 
maybe they'll help me get a hit." Dempsey entered Friday in an 0-for-17 slump 
that had dropped his average to .146. . . . Injured Giant pitcher Rick 
Reuschel, on the disabled list because of a strained right groin muscle, threw 
on the side Friday and experienced no pain. Look for him to return to the Giant 
rotation by the middle of next week. If Kelly Downs has a successful start 
Sunday in his return from a shoulder injury, the depleted Giant staff could 
suddenly have seven starters: Dave Dravecky, Scott Garrelts, Mike LaCoss, Bob 
Knepper, Don Robinson, Reuschel and Downs. . . . A day after Dravecky defeated 
Cincinnati, 4-3, in his successful return from cancer surgery on his left arm, 
he said the arm felt fine. "There is just the normal stiffness, nothing more," 
said Dravecky, who said he spent Thursday night in a quiet celebration at the 
apartment of teammate Atlee Hammaker. "I had to get away from the 25 messages 
on my answering machine," Dravecky said.

MORNING BRIEFING: BULLPEN IS BAFFLED BY THROWIN' VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball players apparently never run out of ways to have fun at the expense of 
their teammates. Yankee relief pitcher Dave Righetti told the New York Times: 
</P>
<P>
"Our bullpen is right under the bleachers, and we hear a lot of stuff from 
fans. In the last two years, Charlie Hudson would come out there and hide 
behind a pillar, disguise his voice and act like a fan. He'd ride us, give us 
the Bronx cheer, the whole works. 
</P>

"Scott Nielsen went for a month thinking it was the real thing. I don't think 
Neil Allen ever found out."

Trivia time: Who pitched the first no-hitter in Dodger Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
Sweet dreams: Andre Rison, Indianapolis Colts receiver from Michigan State, on 
his $890,000 signing bonus, half of which is deferred: "My money is sleeping. I 
hope when it wakes up, there's more of it." 
</P>
<P>
Slim-and-none Dept.: Indicating that Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor never 
had a chance of signing Danny Ferry, Ailene Voisin of the Atlanta Journal 
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Former Clipper Coach Gene Shue, who was fired last Jan. 18, is Danny Ferry's 
godfather and a close friend of the family. During his 20 months with the 
organization, Shue tangled frequently with Baylor regarding personnel and 
coaching matters."

Fickle fates: Writes Russ White of the Orlando Sentinel, indicating all has not 
gone well for the 1969 Miracle Mets: 
</P>
<P>
"Donn Clendenon, who gained a law degree after his playing career, pleaded 
guilty to a charge of cocaine possession last year in Sioux Falls, S.D. Catcher 
Jerry Grote served time in jail for cattle sale fraud. Left fielder Cleon Jones 
received a suspended sentence for forging checks. Reliever Jack DiLauro joined 
a California commune in 1970 and hasn't been heard from since." 
</P>
<P>
White said 14 of the 25 players have been divorced, two of them twice. 
</P>
<P>
Straight arrow: How straight is Mike Reid off the tee? Writes Gordon S. White 
Jr. of the New York Times: "Usually, you do not ask Reid how many fairways he 
missed. You ask him how many water sprinkler lines he missed."

<P>
'Fessing up: As he goes into his fifth year as a CBS football analyst, Terry 
Bradshaw told the Houston Chronicle, "I should've been canned right off the

John Madden."

<P>
Heat treatment: Boston's Mike Boddicker, asked his secret after he had reeled 
off five straight victories with a 0.78 earned-run average, said: "More

miss."

WEEKEND RACING AT DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
A NO-STAR FIELD FOR THE EDDIE READ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even Eddie Read might have had trouble selling the 1989 version of the race 
that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's $250,000 Eddie Read Handicap, named for the late Del Mar public 
relations director, is woefully short of stars for its 16th running at 1 1/8 
miles on the turf, even though four of the contenders have won Grade I races. 
</P>
<P>
It is a surprising turn of events, because the middle-distance grass division 
in California has been one of the strongest in recent years. In fact, the last 
four winners of the Read -- Deputy Governor, Sharrood, Al Mamoon and Tsunami 
Slew -- were of world-class quality and helped boost the race to Grade I 
status. 
</P>
<P>
With division leaders Peace and Steinlen absent -- along with Frankly Perfect, 
Nasr el Arab and Great Communicator, all pointing for the Arlington Million -- 
this edition of the Read shapes up as a showdown between Silver Circus, the 
1988 Del Mar Derby winner, and Mister Wonderful II, winner of the American 
Handicap at Hollywood Park July 4. Silver Circus will carry top weight of only 
118 pounds, giving Mister Wonderful II a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mandella trains the English-bred Mister Wonderful II for Santa Monica 
car dealer Steven Taub. The American Handicap marked the first U.S. stakes 
victory in 10 starts for the 6-year-old son of Mummy's Pet. 
</P>
<P>
Mandella, who is having his finest season, took over the training of Mister 
Wonderful II in January. His first challenge was an injured hoof. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just getting over a quarter crack when he came to us," said Mandella. 
"They had to cut out a pretty good chunk, and it took some time to grow back." 
</P>
<P>
Mandella decided to bring Mister Wonderful II back to the races in a 
six-furlong Breeders' Cup-sponsored event on the Hollywood Park turf course 
June 25, even though the horse had not sprinted since he was a 3-year-old in 
England. Mister Wonderful II finished a fast-closing third, then trotted back 
to be unsaddled, bleeding profusely from the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"He bit his tongue," Mandella said. "Not bad but, boy, was there a lot of 
blood. He probably didn't even notice it until the race was over." 
</P>
<P>
In the American Handicap eight days later, Mister Wonderful II won at odds of 
10-1, beating Steinlen by a nose at 1 1/8 miles. Pranke, who won the Sunset 
Handicap in his next appearance, finished a close third. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't surprised he won," Mandella noted. "He'd shown us his quality 
already. We were a little surprised that he came around so fast, though." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Mister Wonderful II and Silver Circus, the Eddie Read field features 
Saratoga Passage, The Medic, Pasakos, Skip Out Front, Halcyon Days and Quiet 
Boy. 
</P>
<P>
Mandella has a solid shot to sweep Del Mar's Sunday stakes doubleheader. He 
will be sending out Robert Folsom's 3-year-old filly, Reluctant Guest, in the 
supporting feature, the $100,000 San Clemente Handicap at one mile on the 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the $83,650 Escondido Handicap at 1 3/8 miles today, Charlie Whittingham 
will run Bruce McNall's filly, Raintree Renegade, against Danishgar, Loyal 
Double, Brisque, Blade of the Ball, Foolhearty, Wallotton, Putting, Dance Card 
Filled and Pleasant Variety. . . . The top stable for 2-year-olds this summer 
belongs to trainer Brian Mayberry and his prime patrons, Jan, Mace and Samantha 
Siegel. On Wednesday at Del Mar, their Barachois colt, Doyouseewhatisee, won 
the six-furlong De Anza Stakes by three lengths. It was the Siegels' fourth 
local juvenile winner, and they have had three more in Florida running in Jan's 
name. . . . It has been raining off and on in Chicago, and that is fine with 
Thad Ackel, who will send out Great Communicator against Blushing John today in 
the Arlington Handicap, a prep for the Arlington Million Sept. 3. "He doesn't 
have to necessarily win to please me," said Ackel. "But he's got to come away 
from there running and keep on going." . . . Bedouin, one of the most popular 
claimers ever to run in Southern California, will be paraded after the second 
race today at Del Mar. The gray 8-year-old won 14 of 67 starts and ran 15th in 
the 1984 Kentucky Derby.

ALABAMA STAKES AT SARATOGA; 
</P>
<P>
OPEN MIND TO SEEK HER 10TH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY 
</P>

SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Jersey might be first in tomatoes, gangland burials and beauty pageants, 
but the state has never been known for the horses it has bred. 
</P>
<P>
Regret, a bona fide Jersey-bred, became the first filly to win the Kentucky 
Derby, but that was in 1915 and not many New Jersey-breds have distinguished 
themselves since then. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, there's Open Mind, another 3-year-old filly who, after not 
getting the chance to run in the Derby, has forged a record quite similar to 
Regret's. Elected to the Hall of Fame here in 1957, Regret had a career that 
included nine wins and one second-place finish in 11 starts. Open Mind takes a 
13-race record of 11 wins and two seconds, including nine straight victories, 
into today's 109th running of the Alabama Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, seven other fillies have entered the 1 1/4-mile Alabama, 
including Lea Lucinda, a stablemate of Open Mind's. It was another stablemate, 
Some Romance, who was the last horse to beat Open Mind, by a nose in the 
Frizette at Belmont Park 10 months ago. Open Mind's other loss, by 4 1/2 
lengths, came a month before the Frizette when she finished second to Ms. Gold 
Pole in the Lassie at Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Open Mind will be coupled in the betting with Lea Lucinda, because they 
both race for trainer Wayne Lukas. The ownership is different, Open Mind 
belonging to Gene Klein and Lea Lucinda being the property of Calumet Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama draw gave the rail to Dearly Loved, with Jean Cruguet in the 
saddle. Outside them, in order, come Rose Park with Raul Rojas; Naskra's 
Return, Jose Santos; Open Mind, Angel Cordero; Lea Lucinda, Randy Romero; 
Silent Classic, Eddie Maple; Nite of Fun, Chris Antley, and Dream Deal, Craig 
Perret. As though Open Mind needs another advantage, she will carry 121 pounds, 
the same as the others. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind was bred in New Jersey by Robert Brennan, through the mating of 
Deputy Minister and Stage Luck, a Stage Door Johnny mare who was a minor stakes 
winner and who produced one previous stakes winner. Deputy Minister, a grandson 
of Northern Dancer, won the Eclipse Award as best 2-year-old colt in 1981, then 
had his career ended by injury before he could run in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Klein, Lukas bought Open Mind as a yearling for $150,000. A 
victory today would increase the filly's earnings to almost $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea she was a Jersey-bred when I bid on her," Lukas said. "The 
important thing was that she looked like a race horse. Her name came from the 
fact that I went into the sale with an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who became the third man to win the Derby with a filly, with Winning 
Colors in 1988, also had an open mind about this year's Derby. But Lukas 
dissuaded him from running Open Mind, and instead she was an easy winner of the 
Kentucky Oaks, which is run for 3-year-old fillies the day before the Derby. 
Partly because of her small size, Lukas didn't feel that Open Mind had a good 
chance against Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, who ran 1-2 in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind's career actually began against colts, and in New Jersey, where she 
won a couple of races at Monmouth Park. After the two defeats, she began the 
current winning streak with a 1 3/4-length victory in the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs and then, in case the voters had doubts, 
she clinched the 2-year-old filly title with a victory two weeks later in the 
Demoiselle at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind won the Demoiselle by a neck. She usually wins more comfortably than 
that, although in her last start, the Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont, 
she needed intervention from the stewards to beat Nite of Fun, who finished 
first by a nose after clobbering Lukas' filly in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
That victory made Open Mind the seventh filly to sweep the Acorn, the Mother 
Goose and the Coaching Club. Open Mind's people make no apologies and don't 
feel that she backed into the honor. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost three lengths on the interference and only got beat six inches," says 
Jeff Lukas, who handles the Saratoga operation for his father. "She was going 
to win if she didn't have to alter course." 
</P>
<P>
Nite of Fun was soundly beaten by Open Mind in the Mother Goose and the Acorn, 
finishing 28 1/2 lengths behind Lukas' filly, but trainer Jimmy Toner is back 
for more. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my filly would have finished first in the Oaks if there had been no 
bumping in the stretch," Toner said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides winning, Open Mind has handled all kinds of courses. She has won three 
times at Belmont, twice each at Monmouth, Gulfstream Park and Churchill Downs 
and once at Aqueduct and Laurel. She has won over mud and before large crowds 
-- more than 65,000 saw both the Kentucky Oaks and the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
And now she has a chance to add Saratoga to the list. It's the same track where 
that other classy Jersey-bred, Regret, suffered one of her two career defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel Cordero is shooting for his second straight victory in the Alabama. He 
won with Maplejinsky last year. . . . Calumet won the Alabama with Our Mims in 
1977 and she was later voted best 3-year-old filly. . . . Wayne Lukas won the 
1984 Alabama with Life's Magic. . . . Dream Deal comes into the Alabama after 
winning the Monmouth Oaks, the stake in which Naskra's Return ran fourth and 
Lea Lucinda was seventh. . . . Shy Tom probably will join Clever Trevor and Le 
Voyageur in facing Easy Goer next Saturday in the $1-million Travers. . . . 
Shuvee and Mom's Command are the only horses to win both the New York triple 
for fillies and the Alabama. . . . Adjudicating, a 2-year-old son of Danzig who 
is undefeated in two New York races, makes his stakes debut for trainer Shug 
McGaughey in the $200,000 Sapling at Monmouth Park today. With Cordero riding 
Open Mind, Randy Romero takes over the mount. Julie Krone, the leading jockey 
at Monmouth, will be riding Carson City for Lukas. On Thursday, Krone won her 
first stake at Saratoga, the Yaddo with Sweet Blow Pop.

<P>
John Paul Cain, a rookie on the Senior PGA Tour, shot a five-under-par 67 
Friday to take a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the Rancho Murieta 
Senior Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Still was in second place at 68. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Beallo, Bert Yancey, Phil Rodgers and Dave Hill shot 69s, and Al Geiberger, 
Dan Morgan and Bob Erickson had 70s on the 6,674-yard Rancho Murieta Country 
Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Cain earned $45,000 when he won the Greater Grand Rapids Open last month. 
Friday, the 53-year-old stockbroker from Houston made five birdies and said 
that his victory, which earned him a one-year exemption, has allowed him to 
relax and play his normal game. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the hardest things about playing tournament golf is to be patient," 
Cain said. "The guys who have played out here for 30 years have learned that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, who began his round on the 10th hole, was six under par after his first 
eight holes. He was still six under par after a birdie on the sixth hole but 
then bogeyed the next two holes to finish with a 68. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's kind of like the fisherman who caught a 30-pounder and let it get 
away," Still said, after playing his first nine holes in 31, only to shoot a 37 
on the next nine. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Bob Charles, the tour's second-leading money-winner so far 
this year, shot a 73. Orville Moody, the leading money-winner with $382,768, 
shot a 72. Moody won the Gold Rush in 1987.

EARLY TRAGEDY TOUCHED LETTER CARRIER'S LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
TAYLOR'S FATHER, A HEAVY DRINKER, WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY DAUGHTER AFTER HE BEAT 
HIS WIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Merlin Taylor, the mail carrier who went on a shooting rampage Thursday at 
the Orange Glen postal station, was touched by another tragedy more than 30 
years ago -- the night his father reportedly came home drunk, beat the boy's 
mother and then was shot to death by the boy's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who was on life-support systems Friday night at Palomar Medical Center 
after being declared brain dead, was a teen-ager at the time his father was 
killed in the mid-1950s, in the family's small farm home in central Missouri, 
according to several longtime family acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
But what effect, if any, the earlier tragedy may have had on his decision 
Thursday morning to shoot his wife, then kill two co-workers and wound a third 
is uncertain. Two of Taylor's brothers and a sister declined to discuss the 
incident Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Clues to Motive 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his relatives and co-workers here suggested in stronger terms Friday 
that the man who was described as a "model employee" was growing disillusioned 
with his work, and that stress, rather than personal problems, might be to 
blame for the Thursday morning bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
But Escondido Police Lt. Danny Starr said investigators may remain forever 
baffled by Taylor's motive and may have to write it off as "a tragedy that 
can't be explained." 
</P>
<P>
Starr said Taylor, 52, may have believed that he was under investigation by 
postal authorities for mail theft -- even though there was no such inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"One of his co-workers told one of our investigators that Taylor thought they 
were trying to fire him for mail theft, but we checked with the Post Office, 
and they said there absolutely was no such investigation," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Starr said investigators continued Friday to talk to relatives and co-workers 
-- and that, although all have offered speculation, there are no new leads. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting little bits and pieces of what people think might have been the 
problem, but nothing has hit us in the face that would explain why he went off 
the deep end," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the person who could tell us is Taylor. . . . His close friends 
or his wife might have been privy to something, but he took them with him. 
That's made it tough for us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled First Marriage 
</P>
<P>
Attention also focused on Taylor's alleged violent behavior against his former 
wife, Mary, who divorced Taylor in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed in Vista Superior Court quoted Mary Taylor as saying she wanted 
to end her marriage because her husband was "extraordinarily violent, 
frequently drinks to excess, has threatened (her) life on many occasions and . 
. . physically struck, battered and beat (her) to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
But Ramon D. Asedo, the attorney who represented John Taylor in the divorce, 
disputed the allegations of drinking and beating. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no showing of physical violence," Asedo said Friday. "It was an 
extremely quiet, placid and pleasant separation. There was no real drinking or 
abuse, and that petition is just the kind of typical garbage we lawyers put in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father a Heavy Drinker 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's father, a farmer and heavy-machine operator, was a heavy drinker and 
wife abuser, according to several family acquaintances who live near the Taylor 
hometown of Mokane, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the Taylor boys all my life. It's a big family," said James St. 
George Tucker, past president of the Kingdom of Callaway Historical Society, 
which serves Mokane. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a respected family. Joe (the father) was good size, but he started 
drinking. He started abusing his wife. And the daughter shot him and killed him 
at the house." 
</P>
<P>
The daughter, whose name was not known Friday, was exonerated in the shooting, 
Tucker said, mainly because Joseph Taylor had a "long history of abuse and 
drinking, of hitting his wife mainly, but the kids too." 
</P>
<P>
"The court found her innocent," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Maupin, the undertaker who buried Joseph Taylor, recalled that the killing 
was the last thing the community expected, despite the rumors of alcohol and 
wife abuse. "It was a large family and a well-known family, so it was a shock," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mokane Mayor Howard (Glen) Paul, who grew up down the block from the Taylors, 
said the shooting "had an effect here, and everybody here remembers it." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether John Taylor was at home the night his 
father was killed, and two brothers and a sister still living in the Mokane 
area declined to talk about their brother or the shooting. But other sources in 
Mokane recalled that, soon after his father's death, young John Taylor 
graduated from high school and joined the Marine Corps in 1955. He later 
settled in the San Diego area, the only member of his family to leave Missouri, 
and joined the Postal Service in March, 1964.

Ex-Wife Declines Comment

On Friday, his previous wife, Mary Taylor, and her five children by that 
marriage, declined comment. "We ask for your understanding, patience and 
empathy at this very difficult time for our family," the family said in a 
prepared statement that was read at Palomar Medical Center. Thursday's shooting 
rampage began five blocks from Mary Taylor's home, where her former husband 
shot his wife, Liesbeth, twice in the head as she lay in bed. 
</P>
<P>
One of John Taylor's three stepchildren said Friday that the postal carrier had 
been complaining increasingly about the aches and pains from his job. 
</P>
<P>
"He was complaining about his back, his heels, his shoulder hurting," said Mike 
McMullen, 22. 
</P>
<P>
After killing his wife, Taylor, dressed in his postal uniform, then drove to 
the Orange Glen postal station about half a mile away, where he shot and killed 
two co-workers with whom he would share a cup of coffee and a smoke most 
mornings before work at a loading-dock picnic table. Taylor then went inside 
and wounded a third employee before shooting himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Ron Williams, 56, of Escondido, and Richard Berni, 38, of San 
Marcos. Paul DeRisi was shot in the arm, and a fourth co-worker was injured 
when she fell while fleeing the building, in the 1700 block of East Valley 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen discounted suggestions by neighbors that his mother and stepfather 
were experiencing marital difficulties. "They were very happy," said McMullen, 
who lives nearby in Escondido. "They were going to be leaving soon for a 
vacation back to Missouri to visit his (Taylor's) mom." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen said his stepfather was able to put on a happy face at work, and 
generally did not complain at home about his job but, nonetheless, said he was 
growing weary of it. He said that he, his brother and his sister were 
considering hiring an attorney, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postal Workers Return 
</P>
<P>
Work at the post office on Friday returned to something close to normal, as 
three psychologists mingled with employees -- and met privately with some -- 
who returned to work, only to face a backlog of undelivered mail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a somber attitude inside, but they seem to be working like they were 
before the shooting," U.S. Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of Thursday morning's onslaught were covered up with white paint by the 
time employees arrived for work Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said that, of the 43 postal workers scheduled to work on Friday, two 
carriers and four clerks called in sick, and another worker showed up for work 
but then left. Workers from other stations were brought in to help with the 
mail that had gone undelivered Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the city, mailboxes were adorned with yellow ribbons. One resident 
erected a makeshift American flag at half-staff on his mailbox. At the post 
office, several small bouquets were placed at the flagpole, and inside the 
building, 300 helium-filled balloons -- donated by a local businessman -- added 
an unusual splash of color. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's route on Friday was handled by one of his closest friends, Jonny Sims, 
who said he was still at a loss to explain Taylor's outburst. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavy Mail Load Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
"I know one thing -- that there was an awful lot of pressure at work, but it 
never seemed to bother him," Sims said. "But Wednesday night he was bombarded 
with so much mail it was unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before that I thought that maybe it was something at home that got to 
him, but then why did he bring it to the post office?" Sims asked. "I can't 
figure it, and I hate to play amateur psychologist." 
</P>
<P>
Sims said Taylor was a homebody who regularly declined opportunities to go out 
with co-workers after work. "He'd never go out with the guys," he said. "He 
always wanted to go home, and he'd only go out with his wife. I always thought 
that his wife was his best friend -- along with his children. They were his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Both Sims and Taylor's stepson discounted notions that the shooting may have 
been brought on by financial problems. "His wife was very frugal with money. 
There were never any problems with her spending too much," Sims said. "Besides, 
she had her own job and her own income. They kept it separate. He probably 
never knew how much money she had -- and she probably never knew how much he 
had. He wasn't cheap. If ever we had to pass the hat around for something, you 
could always count on John putting in the most." 
</P>
<P>
Danny McMullen, a 24-year-old stepson who lived with the couple, agreed that 
his mother and stepfather had no money problems. "He didn't even want my mom to 
work, but she chose to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Danny and Mike McMullen said Taylor did not drink, except for an 
occasional beer. "I doubt you'd even find a beer in the refrigerator right 
now," Danny McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stress on the Job 
</P>
<P>
Edward Dunne, vice president of the postal union local in Escondido, dismissed 
contentions that the shooting could be attributed solely to any personal 
problems Taylor was having. Dunne also countered arguments by postal officials 
that a recent series of suicides and shootings by postal employees are not the 
result of high stress on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I really take exception to that," he said. "It may be true that something in 
their personal life triggers it. But the very fact that they go to the post 
office to do these terrible, tragic acts, where they take out other postal 
employees or a supervisor, or take their own lives, makes a very powerful 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"And that statement is that this job has produced a lot of my anxiety and a lot 
of my problems and a lot of my stress. These people are saying to us before 
they take their lives that maybe it's time to enter the 20th Century and 
realize you can only push people so far," Dunne said. "People have different 
stress levels and different breaking points." 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said Friday that he had asked the House Post 
Office and Civil Service Committee to open an inquiry into the recent series of 
shootings and suicides and their relationship to work stress. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope there might be some recommendations on how to improve postal 
operations and reduce the stress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Cannone, a spokesman at the main post office in San Diego, denied that 
postal workers are under any more stress than other groups of workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The stress issue has been brought up by a lot of individuals. But there's no 
evidence this (Taylor shooting) is related to any postal stress," Cannone said. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, people ask if there's stress in the post office. And our answer is 
that we're not going to deny that. But not to the degree that would cause a 
normal, level-headed person to do the kind of tragic things that were done" in 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Postmaster Margaret Sellers, who spent much of Friday visiting 
members of the victims' families, declined comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"She's pretty frustrated, and she's really got her hands full," said Cannone.

BENES IS BEATEN IN MAJOR DEBUT AS PADRES SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Benes waited a lifetime for this opportunity Friday, wondering just what 
it was like to step on that mound and pitch in his first major league game. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the NCAA tournament was nice. And the Olympics were a blast. But the big 
leagues, man, that's been his dream ever since he could put a baseball in his 
right hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty laid-back," Benes said, "but you think about it when you're in the 
clubhouse, watching TV, and you say to yourself, 'God, what would it be like to 
be out there?' " 
</P>
<P>
Well, before he had a chance to contemplate his situation, there he was 
standing on the mound, encircled by a crowd of 25,755 at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. His mother and two brothers were in the stands. His friends and former 
college teammates were back in Evansville, Ind., watching on cable TV. His dad 
was back home in Chicago, sitting in front of their living room TV set. 
</P>
<P>
He knew this was the big-leagues when he found himself facing the superstars, 
such as seven-time All-Star Dale Murphy. Oh, look, there's 42-year-old Darrell 
Evans, who began playing professionally the year he was born. And there's 
Lonnie Smith, the man who has three World Series championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
So you can just imagine just how disillusioned he must have been after the 
Padres' 6-5 loss in the first game of the doubleheader against the Atlanta 
Braves. One of his teammates lost a ball in the sun to help trigger a four-run 
inning, and the Padres' final rally was killed in the ninth when another was 
tagged out at second on the hidden-ball trick. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the big-leagues, kid. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres wound up splitting the doubleheader, winning the second game, 2-0, 
with Dennis Ramsussen (5-8) winning, and Mark Davis recording his major-league 
leading 30th save. But the media mob attending the doubleheader, even including 
a couple of reporters from Evansville, weren't there to interview Rasmussen, 
talk to Jack Clark about his two-run homer in the second game or ask about Tony 
Gwynn's four-hit game and six-for-eight doubleheader performance that raised 
his average to .346. 
</P>
<P>
No sirree, the focus centered squarely on Andrew Charles Benes, the man the 
Padres paid $235,000 a year ago as the No. 1 pick in all of the land in the 
June free agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
Benes has also found himself in the center of controversy in the Padre 
organization on just how to handle the kid. There was a quarrel whether he 
belonged in the Padre major league spring-training camp this year instead of 
the minor league camp. There was bickering over when Benes should be called up 
from double-A Wichita. There was quibbling whether Benes should be called up to 
the big-leagues now, after yielding an 8.10 ERA in five starts at Las Vegas, 
including 41 hits in 26 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But there he was on display Friday night, with the entire Padre front office on 
hand, anxiously anticipating the unveiling of pitcher they believe one day will 
be among the elite in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews from the Padre organization were quite favorable, but the bottom 
line was that Benes pitched, well, like a 21-year-old kid making his 
major-league debut. 
</P>
<P>
Benes, 6-feet-6, 235 pounds, showed flashes, striking out six batters on an 
array of fastballs and curveball. 
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that he has a long way to go before he makes anyone forget 
about Dwight Gooden, surrendering three home runs and falling behind in the 
count to 14 of the 27 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
The result: six innings, six hits, six runs, four walks and six strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good, and my arm felt real good," said Benes, who was out 15 days in 
Wichita with tendinitis in his right shoulder. "But I'm disappointed I lost. I 
was the one who got the loss in a game we could have won and stayed on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
"Things will get better. I've still got a lot of things to work on. You just 
don't overpower hitters here like you do in Wichita." 
</P>
<P>
Benes learned the hard way that you can't get by solely on your fastball in the 
big leagues. He said he threw 12 to 15 changeups in the game, which is quite 
remarkable considering that he threw a combined total of about 20 in his 21 
minor-league starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Only one problem. He had difficulty throwing any for strikes. And when it came 
time to throw a pitch in a crucial situation, the Braves knew exactly what was 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
Evans hit a three-two fastball in the second inning for a bases-empty homer 
into the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
Oddibe McDowell came back with another homer in almost the same spot in the 
third inning on a two-zero pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to give up homers, I know that," said Benes, who has yielded 17 in 
his past 66 innings, after not allowing any in his first 75 innings. "So the 
solo homers don't bother me. It's the others that hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres took a 3-2 lead in the fifth before Benes found out that the big 
leagues aren't all that they are cracked up to be. With one out and Brave 
pitcher Derek Lilliquist on first, McDowell hit a line drive into right. Right 
fielder Chris James, who would extend his hitting streak to a career-high 16 
games, squinted into the sun trying to pick up the ball. It was no use. By the 
time he saw it, it was falling by his feet. McDowell wound up with a double, 
and Lilliquist was at third. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Treadway, the man who would pull the hidden ball trick on Marvell Wynne in 
the ninth inning, hit a ball toward the gap. Second baseman Roberto Alomar dove 
and stopped it, saving one run, but the tying run scored. 
</P>
<P>
Benes got ahead on Smith, the Braves' leading hitter, on a zero-and-two count 
and then struck him out on a fastball. Benes knew it should have been the third 
out but refused to allow himself to be distracted as Murphy strode to the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
He worked Murphy to a two-two count, then tried to decide what to throw next. 
He had struck Murphy out on a fastball in the fourth inning and figured he'd 
fool him this time, throwing a curve. Surely, Murphy wouldn't be expecting 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Benes threw a curveball, and Murphy sent it deep into the left-field seats for 
a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell behind two-and-oh a lot tonight and got away with a few of them," Benes 
said. "He didn't give me that chance that time, and that was pretty much the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Still showing confidence in Benes, Padre Manager Jack McKeon stuck with him and 
allowed him to get out of the fifth inning. And when the inning ended, with 
Benes having already thrown 108 pitches, the Padres tried something to which 
Benes is not accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
They left him in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely has he been allowed to throw more than 100 pitches in double-A or 
triple-A this season, but this time, McKeon let him go out for the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of showing signs of weariness or fatigue, Benes mowed down the Braves 
one-two-three for the first time in the game, on two ground balls and a 
strikeout. He was pinch-hit for in the bottom of the sixth, then watched in 
frustration with his teammates as the Padres' ninth-inning rally fell short 
when Wynne was bamboozled on the hidden-ball trick. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed with Benes," McKeon said. "He had problems with his 
off-speed pitches and breaking pitches, but I saw a lot out there. We can get 
that straightened out in a week or so. I saw a lot of promise out there." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Romenesko, the Padres' director of player development who has seen Benes 
perform more than anyone else in the organization, said: "There's no question 
that Andy Benes will pitch in the major leagues, pitch well in the major 
leagues and stay here for a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt at all about that." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Brave left fielder Lonnie Smith, seeing Andy Benes for the first time 
before the game, said: "What position does he play, center field?" When he was 
told he was the Padre starting pitcher in game one of the doubleheader, Smith 
said, "You're kidding me? A guy that big?" . . . Padre left fielder Bip Roberts 
homered in the fifth inning for his first home run since Aug. 15, 1986. His 
last homer had been in the second game of a doubleheader against Cincinnati 
Reds pitcher Tom Browning, a span of 255 at-bats. . . . After going 238 games, 
Sept. 13, 1987-June 4, 1989, without doing so, the Padres have scored in double 
figures four times in their past 60 games.

THEY'RE ALL STILL 'CRANKEES' AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KEN ROSENTHAL, The Baltimore Evening Sun

<P>
This week, Dallas got mad at Lou. Dallas has Lou's old job. Lou has Billy's old 
job. Everyone works for George, who leads the Crankees to paranoia, but not 
pennants. 
</P>
<P>
Lou is a TV announcer. Dallas is the manager. Lou suggested a leadoff hitter to 
Dallas after George suggested new coaches. Dallas said he expects to be fired. 
But Dallas won't quit. No sir. 
</P>
<P>
Where's Billy, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"You know what the problem is here?" Dallas said. "The problem here is that 
there's too much damned pressure to win a baseball game every day. Every one of 
the guys who's been here thinks that way, and they think that way because of 
the guy up there." 
</P>
<P>
The guy up there is George. He changes managers the way fat people change 
diets. The Crankees play in the AL Least, not the AFC East. Still, George 
becomes very upset if they don't win every day. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dallas' pitching staff has allowed the most runs in the majors. This 
makes it very difficult to win every day. George doesn't want to hear it. He 
wants the coaches' heads. Lou wants a new leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Where's Billy, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
The Crankees have won more games than any other team in this decade, but no 
world titles. The last time they were shut out in a decade was 1910-1920. 
Dallas began the '80s managing the world champion Phillies. Now this. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Lou said he doesn't want Dallas' job, when of course he does. 
Sportswriters say Roberto Kelly should bat leadoff. Why can't sportscaster Lou? 
Touchy Dallas. Tough guy Dallas. He'll call his boss names, but he won't quit. 
No sir. 
</P>
<P>
George, Lou, Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas, Lou, George. 
</P>
<P>
Where's Billy, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
SHOWDOWN OF THE WEEK: Back to baseball. More than 45,000 tickets have been sold 
for each of the three games between the Angels and A's at Anaheim Stadium this 
weekend. The most compelling matchup will be Saturday's nationally televised 
duel between Jim Abbott and Bob Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (10-7) has emerged as a strong candidate for Rookie of the Year, but for 
once he's not the central figure in a human-interest saga. Welch's wife, Mary 
Ellen, gave birth to their first child July 27. His mother died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Welch has lost two straight starts. "It's been a battle to get 
refocused," he said. "It busts your heart a little bit. I had the most 
wonderful thing happen in my life, and then the saddest thing, all in a period 
of 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR-ITIS: The Senior Baseball Assn. staged an impressive draft Tuesday (Mark 
Fidrych, J.R. Richard, et al) but no one has signed a contract yet. The 
selected players simply returned index cards indicating interest. 
</P>
<P>
The teams in eight Florida cities will be made up of former major-league 
players over the age of 35 -- except catchers, who must be over 32. League 
officials want play to begin on Nov. 1 and last three months, with five to six 
games a week. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Williams (West Palm Beach) and Gates Brown (Orlando) are expected to be 
named managers shortly. 
</P>
<P>
SAVE OF THE WEEK: Jeff Reardon stayed behind in Minnesota at the start of the 
Twins' three-game visit to Baltimore on Monday so that he could remain with his 
wife, Phebe, who underwent exploratory surgery on a lump in her thymus gland. 
</P>
<P>
After Phebe learned that the lump was benign, she instructed Jeff to head to 
Baltimore with the orders, "save the game for me." Reardon caught a 3 p.m. 
flight, changed planes in Chicago and arrived at Baltimore Washington 
Iternational by 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
He took a cab to Memorial Stadium, and was in uniform by the fourth inning. To 
complete the story, he earned his 20th save in the Twins' 4-2 victory, and is 
now the only active pitcher with 20 saves in eight straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The best day I can remember," Reardon said. 
</P>
<P>
FOUL CALL: Dave Stewart was the victim of a scoring blunder in Seattle when 
Mike Kingery was awarded an inside-the-park homer after hitting a line drive 
that A's left fielder Stan Javier booted to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to call that an inside-the-park home run, then Lassie wasn't a 
dog," Stewart said. "That ticked me off so much I had to give up a real one to 
give the scorekeeper a chance to see what a real one looks like." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Leonard was the beneficiary of Stewart's lesson for official scorer 
Steve Ellis. Stewart has allowed a club-high 17 home runs, including 10 in his 
last 43 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
NO DIFFERENCE: In 12 games since trading for designated hitter Harold Baines, 
the Rangers have gone 5-7 and averaged only 3.67 runs. Baines has the 
game-winning RBI in four of the victories. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers lost, 3-2, to the Orioles Sunday despite fielding a lineup with a 
combined .302 average -- and that included catcher Chad Kreuter, batting .127. 
</P>
<P>
BIG DIFFERENCE: In 11 games since trading for pitcher Frank Viola, Mets 
starters are 7-0 with a 1.68 ERA, three shutouts and five complete games. One 
problem: Viola's support in New York hasn't been any better than it was with 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets scored four runs in his first two starts, so he's 1-0 with a 
no-decision despite allowing only three earned runs in 15 innings. The Twins 
scored a total of 15 runs in 10 of Viola's 12 losses. 
</P>
<P>
FREAK INJURY I: Mickey Hatcher, the Dodgers' leading hitter (.322), was 
entertaining friends at his home Saturday night when a rock came through his 
window. He raced outside to chase the vandals, only to suffer a pulled left 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Nice guy that he is, Hatcher said he wouldn't press charges if the window was 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young once," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FREAK INJURY II: This one's even better. Blue Jays reliever David Wells was 
rushed to a Toronto hospital early Saturday after putting his hand through a 
window. Wells, a lefty in every sense of the word, said he was sleepwalking. 
</P>
<P>
He required five stitches in his left thumb, but the wound was minor. Wells 
claimed he also was sleepwalking on the Jays' last trip to Seattle. With a 
10-game trip looming to Kansas City, Boston and Baltimore, he has been sent to 
a sleep-disorder clinic. 
</P>
<P>
SEE WHAT A VACATION CAN DO? The Indians' Tom Candiotti is 10-0 with a 1.56 ERA 
the last two seasons after coming off the disabled list (6-0 last year after 
Aug. 19, 4-0 this year after July 19). 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make this an annual event, whether Candy needs it or not," 
Indians Manager Doc Edwards announced this week. "Every season, we're going to 
give him a two-week sabbatical." 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers clocked Candiotti's curveball at 52 m.p.h. in a recent start, and 
only one of his fastballs at 80. "He looks like Nolan Ryan after seeing some of 
that other stuff," Terry Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
MILK DELAY: Braves Manager Russ Nixon was incensed when the Reds proceeded with 
their Farmer's Night activities on Friday after a 45-minute rain delay. It only 
made matters worse when Braves bullpen coach Roy Majtyka and reliever Joe 
Boever lost the cow-milking contest to Reds catcher Tom Oliver and pitcher Tom 
Browning. 
</P>
<P>
Lighten up, Russ. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves won, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
SHAKE IT UP, BABY: Remember Scott Scudder, the Reds pitcher who received news 
of his demotion in Los Angeles the moment an earthquake shook the city? He knew 
just what to do when an earthquake hit San Francisco on Tuesday: "I left my 
phone off the hook all day." 
</P>
<P>
AROUND THE HORN: Wouldn't it be something if Bob Knepper helped the Giants edge 
the Astros in the National League West? The Giants, decimated by injuries, 
signed Knepper after he was released by the Astros with a 4-10 record and 5.89 
ERA. The Indians also showed interest, but Knepper wanted to return to his 
original team. He allowed two runs in six innings in his first start. 
</P>
<P>
Braves left-hander Tom Glavine is 4-0 against the Dodgers this season, but 
that's nothing. Glavine's first pitching coach in the Braves' system, Larry 
Jaster, shut out the Dodgers five times for the Cardinals in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Braves, John Smoltz is winless in four decisions since July 7, 
the day after he was named to the All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
The latest player to wear glasses is the Royals' Kevin Seitzer. Seitzer has 
20-20 vision -- the glasses make it 20-10. "It's amazing; all the images are 
sharp and clearer now," Seitzer said. Alvin Davis and Glenn Braggs are other 
players who benefited from trying corrective lenses. Eddie Murray was insulted 
by the idea in altimore.

WINSTON WEST TO STOP AT SAUGUS; 
</P>
<P>
TIGHT POINTS BATTLE, BIG PURSE FEATURED IN SERIES EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fans at Saugus Speedway will witness a few uncommon sights tonight as the $1.3 
million Winston West Series highlights the track's biggest night of the season 
with the Winston 200. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, the race will include something foreign to Saugus: pit stops. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be able to change tires, refuel, everything they need to do," Saugus 
promoter Ray Wilkings said. 
</P>
<P>
That's because tonight's race -- the first Winston West event at Saugus in 12 
years -- will be a 200-lap, 66.6-mile marathon, the longest race in the 50-year 
history of the one-third-mile paved oval. The last Winston West race at Saugus, 
in June, 1977, was 150 laps. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, fans will see some unfamiliar faces and some unfamiliar cars. Big 
cars. Like Monte Carlos and Firebirds. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, a Winston Cup car," Wilkings said. "The closest thing you can get 
to Winston Cup on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Winston West Series has evolved into NASCAR's most lucrative racing 
endeavor on the West Coast. And tonight's purse is expected to exceed $31,000, 
with approximately $5,000 going to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more than money at stake. Never in its 36-year history has the 
series featured so competitive a battle for the championship, so tonight's 
action figures to include some old-fashioned, barn-burning door handle-to-door 
handle racing. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
With eight of 11 events completed, points leader Bill Schmitt of Redding is 
clinging to a one-point lead over defending series champion Roy Smith of 
Victoria, Canada. Rookie surprise Bill Sedgwick of Van Nuys, the only series 
competitor who is a former Saugus regular, is third, 54 points behind Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Only 149 points separate the top five drivers, only 215 separate the top six. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three races, the lead has changed hands 37 times. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's race at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield, Smith and Schmitt 
swapped the lead seven times during the final 81 laps before Smith took the 
checkered flag by 0.6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick, who survived a troublesome pit stop on Lap 160, rallied to nip 
Schmitt at the finish to claim second. With another win, Sedgwick will become 
the first series rookie to win three races. 
</P>
<P>
"The chance of both Schmitt and Smith having a problem in the next three races 
is probably pretty slim," Sedgwick said. "But I'm here to keep the heat on as 
best I can, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
A look at the top competitors, between whom one could hardly wedge a gasket: 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt: A lumberjack by profession and a Winston West competitor since 1974, 
Schmitt has logged the most career earnings of any active series competitor 
with $407,629. He won championships in 1977 and 1979, and, although his points 
lead over Smith is the smallest of margins, Schmitt insists that he feels no 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the Schmitt and Smith Show and it seems like it's getting down to 
that," Schmitt, 53, said. "But I've been at this a long time. I feel if I go in 
with the attitude of winning, that'll keep me in front. I'm going down there to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his points lead, winning is something Schmitt has accomplished just 
once this year. His victory July 4 in Portland, Ore., was the 15th of his 
career. He has seven top-five and eight top-10 finishes this season. Schmitt 
last raced at Saugus in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the track was more difficult than any other track I've been on," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith: The Winston West titlist in 1980, '82 and '88, Smith, 45, is the series' 
only active three-time champion. With his second victory of the season at Mesa 
Marin, Smith has trimmed Schmitt's lead to a point and reduced the title race 
to a two-car battle. Smith is the series' leading money winner this season with 
$32,910. He has earned $278,579 in his Winston West career, which began in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick: With two wins, eight top-five finishes, nine top-10 finishes and 
$21,975 in earnings, Sedgwick, 34, has all but clinched rookie-of-the-year 
honors. Sedgwick, who competed in Saugus' Street Stock and Sportsman divisions 
from 1979 to '83, leads the rookie standings with 24 points. His nearest 
challenger, Jerry Bowers of Meridian, Ida., has 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal this year was to be rookie of the year," Sedgwick said. "Being in the 
points race, that makes it all the better." 
</P>
<P>
Hershell McGriff: With 1,221 points, McGriff, in fourth place, trails Sedgwick 
by just 48 points. "Mathematically, I guess I could win the championship, but 
it isn't probable," said McGriff, a resident of Portland and Green Valley, 
Ariz. "But I could catch Sedgwick." 
</P>
<P>
McGriff, 61, the series' oldest competitor, began racing in 1945 and has 14 
victories at now-defunct Riverside International Raceway. McGriff considers his 
victory in the 2,178-mile Pan-American Mexican Road Race in 1950 the highlight 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
A series competitor since 1971, McGriff is the only active driver with a 
Winston West win at Saugus, although he has not raced there since 1974. He has 
competed in 166 Winston West events, won 32 and has 109 top-10 finishes. His 
career Winston West earnings total $343,837. 
</P>
<P>
Rick McCray: A resident of Highland, Calif., McCray, 33, is fifth in the points 
standings with 1,176 but has yet to win a race. "My problem is I'm running out 
of my own pocket and nobody else's, so I gotta be extremely conservative," 
McCray said. "I don't like making excuses, but what can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
McCray last raced at Saugus in 1986 when he finished fifth in a NASCAR 
Southwest Tour race. He has three top-five and six top-10 finishes.

SHOUP, CLU MAY END UP IN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
LAWYER WARNS SCHOOL LEGAL ACTION PROBABLE IF COACH IS DENIED FOOTBALL POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His job as football coach at Cal Lutheran University is under siege. So what 
will Bob Shoup, master tactician and winner of 182 games and 13 league 
championships, do? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
He will show up for work, watch films, plot strategy, converse with his staff 
and players, supervise practice and try to ignore the fact that he has been 
cast as an unwanted man by the school that has called him coach for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference Friday afternoon at CLU, Shoup and his Westlake 
Village-based attorney, Jim Armstrong, outlined plans to "dot the I's and cross 
the Ts" in terms of fulfilling the coach's written contract with Cal Lutheran 
and threatened a lawsuit if the school does not abide by the same document. 
</P>
<P>
That contract, which was negotiated in April, calls for Shoup to coach CLU's 
football team during the upcoming season before taking a one-year sabbatical 
leave beginning in January and expiring in December, 1990, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
The school announced earlier this week that Shoup would be welcomed back from 
his sabbatical, as a teacher, but that his coaching career at Cal Lutheran 
would conclude at the end of the upcoming season. However, Shoup claims that as 
a tenured professor he is entitled, by the terms of CLU's faculty handbook, to 
reclaim the same job he left -- including that of the head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Miller, Cal Lutheran's president, disagrees. He said Wednesday afternoon 
that Shoup is tenured as a teacher but not as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The university always retains its prerogatives and initiatives for the 
appointment of coaches on an annual basis," Miller said. "I am not aware of any 
university in the country that has a coaching position that is controlled by 
tenure considerations." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran plans to begin a national search for Shoup's successor this fall 
and to have a new head coach by January. All of which could lead to a bizarre 
scenario should two coaches claim the Kingsmen football program as their domain 
before the start of the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the school's announcement that Shoup would be dropped as CLU's 
football coach at the end of the 1989 season was "built upon earlier agreements 
and conversations with Coach Shoup" dating to February. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposals were initiated by Coach Shoup himself," Miller said. "We 
discussed them fully in the conference which he had with me for more than an 
hour on Tuesday afternoon, which preceded the university's issuance of any 
statement on this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup says that he approached James Halseth, CLU's dean of students, with an 
"early retirement plan" which was tentatively agreed to but later was altered 
by the school. Shoup declined the school's offer and was later asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of retirement came up again when Shoup met with school officials 
Tuesday morning. "They suggested it as a possibility," Shoup said earlier this 
week, "and I said no." 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Armstrong warned CLU officials that should they 
"attempt to interfere with (Shoup's) existing written contract any further, 
we'll probably see them in a court of law." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup, speaking with his wife Helen at his side, said he has not been told why 
the university wishes to replace him, but he surmised that his age, the 
"misfortunes of the football program" in recent years (the Kingsmen are 16-27 
since 1985) and "controversy" may have been factors. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing has to be in some way linked to the move to the Division III and 
the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference," Shoup said. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup, 57, who is 182-81-6 at CLU, had argued against the school moving out of 
the NAIA Golden State Athletic Conference and NCAA Division II Western Football 
Conference to join the non-scholarship SCIAC. 
</P>
<P>
Since the school's decision to make the switch last fall, Shoup said he has 
tried to maintain a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"The NCAA Division III and the SCIAC are obviously a part of where we're going 
and I will support to the best of my ability all the rules and regulations and 
policies of those governing bodies." 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to coach football this year," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Miller declined to state a reason for the coaching change, citing a school 
policy against public discussion about personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, himself a former college football coach, charged that Shoup should 
be "praised and acclaimed" for his contributions to Cal Lutheran's development 
as a university, rather than be the subject of "a slinky, what I consider 
cheap, effort to pressure him out of a job." 
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that Shoup had been threatened in writing with "consequences," 
including possible termination, if he spoke to the media. Shoup declined to 
divulge who authored the warning and no evidence of such a letter was made 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who was interviewed from his office after the news conference, declined 
knowledge of such a threat. "I have no knowledge of any kind of threat or 
suggestion," he said. "It certainly didn't emanate from me or my office or 
anybody who works close to me or reports to me." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the start of this season draws ever closer. Cal Lutheran will play 
its annual alumni game Sept. 2 before opening its regular season against Sonoma 
State the following Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel my first responsibility right now lies with the players here at Cal 
Lutheran who have elected to stay in a very difficult situation, knowing 
they're going to be competing at a Division II schedule under Division III 
guidelines," Shoup said. "I feel a real responsibility to those players."

KELLEY LOOKS FOR WAY TO CASH IN ON HIS HOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Kelley collects trophies. Lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have about 50 or 60," said Kelley, Saugus Speedway's Hobby Stock division 
points leader. "When I first started racing, all I wanted was a trophy. But 
now? Money!" 
</P>
<P>
Kelley seemingly is capable of putting money where his trophies are. Two weeks 
ago Kelley, a 23-year-old track sophomore from Arleta, posted his sixth 
main-event win of the season -- most of any driver in any division at Saugus. 
He also has posted seven "fast times," the top one-lap qualifying time of the 
evening -- also a track high. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelley won't soon be driving for dollars. Not as long as he remains a 
member of the track's Hobby Stock class. Whether driving in a main event or a 
heat race, it's all just a trophy dash for Kelley and his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Hobby, you see, is the operative word in Hobby Stock, Saugus' lower echelon of 
racing. The division offers no monetary reward for main-event wins or track 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Only trophies. 
</P>
<P>
"My roommates are going to throw me out if I bring any more home," Kelley said. 
"Last week, I gave a trophy to a little kid in the pits. He wanted an 
autograph. I said, 'Here's a trophy.' 
</P>
<P>
"Trophies mean a lot, but after a while, it gets to the point where you're 
spending your rent money on tires." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Flavin of West Hills has won five Hobby Stock main events -- second 
only to Kelley among Saugus drivers. In his fifth season, Flavin, fourth in the 
points standings, estimates his trophy total at 25 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
But Flavin, 28, is more concerned with his operating costs that, he says, have 
exceeded $10,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the season, I had so much money set aside and I used it up 
real fast," Flavin said. "I enjoy racing, but this is probably my last year. I 
gotta start thinking about my future. I can't be spending $10,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
Having to compete for virtually nothing is a common complaint among Hobby Stock 
drivers, who have in the past petitioned Saugus officials -- with little 
success -- for a piece of the financial pie. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way most tracks' entry-level division is," Saugus promoter Ray 
Wilkings said. "If you want to run for money, go to Street Stocks. If you want 
to run cheap and keep it competitive, run Hobby Stock." 
</P>
<P>
That thinking is prevalent at short tracks throughout the country. Saugus' 
Hobby Stock division is considered a "claimer" class in which any driver can 
"claim" another driver's vehicle by presenting $500 at the end of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to discourage drivers from spending money to improve performance 
and consequently promote parity among competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's going to kill each other over a trophy," Wilkings said. "It's not 
like the dog-eat-dog competitive nature of Street Stocks. But they put on a 
hell of a show. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told them, 'If you want to compete for money move up to Street Stocks. 
You've proved yourself in Hobby Stocks. Go to Street Stocks and prove your 
competitive nature.' It's not that big a move." 
</P>
<P>
Kelley admits that the situation is "a little hard to swallow." But he plans to 
take Wilkings' advice next season. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I would stay (in Hobby Stocks), is if they pay," Kelley said. 
"They way I look at it, if a guy brings his car through the gate, he should get 
paid." 
</P>
<P>
Motor Sports Weekend: Stock-car racing at Ventura Raceway will not resume until 
Sept. 1 as the Ventura County Fair gets under way next week. The one-fifth-mile 
dirt oval, however, will be the scene of the fair's Motor Sports Weekend, 
beginning with the annual Ventura County Fair Motocross on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Final-round qualifying took place last weekend. One-hundred and forty riders 
will compete in seven classes, ranging from 80cc beginners to 500cc 
professionals in the motorcycle division, and 250cc beginners to 500cc 
professionals in quad racers (four-wheel vehicles). 
</P>
<P>
Total purse for the motocross will be about $7,000, according to track manager 
Jim Naylor. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the raceway will feature a "Monster Truck and Tractor Pull." 
</P>
<P>
Racing begins Friday at 2 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 805-656-1122. 
</P>
<P>
Points standings: Don Prudhomme of Granada Hills is fourth among Funny Car 
competitors in the National Hot Rod Assn. Winston Drag Racing Series points 
standings after qualifying second in the Seafair Nationals last weekend in 
Kent, Wash.. 
</P>
<P>
Prudhomme lost in Sunday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kendall of La Canada finished fourth in the Sports Car Club of America's 
Trans Am Series race in Lime Rock, Conn., last weekend and is third in the SCCA 
Trans Am points standings after eight of 14 events. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Spangler of Northridge leads Gary Sigman of Carson by a point to pace the 
Saugus Sportsman division points leaders. Spangler, however, trails Sigman by 
248 points among the leaders of the Sunbelt Region of the NASCAR Racing Series 
standings, which bases its standings on victories at 11 short tracks in 
California, Alabama, Arizona, Florida and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Sigman, with eight top-five finishes, is in 32nd place with 2,385 points. 
Spangler, also with eight top-five finishes, is 46th with 2,137 points. 
</P>
<P>
Will Harper of Tarzana, with 13 top-five finishes, is 25th with 2,524 points to 
lead all drivers from Saugus. The top 10 drivers at season's end will share a 
$15,000 purse.

DIGEST: SHIMOYAMA TRANSFERS TO N. HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suzi Shimoyama, the most valuable player last season for the Louisville High 
girls' basketball team, has transferred to North Hollywood High as a 
participant in the school's newly established highly gifted student magnet 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Shimoyama, who was an All-San Fernando Valley League selection last year as a 
freshman, will team with highly regarded Jacinda Sweet, a junior guard. 
</P>
<P>
"This should really help take some of the heat off of Sweet," North Hollywood 
Coach Rich Allen said. "She's been getting double- and triple-teamed all 
summer. They worked real well together in the (summer) games where both of them 
have been there. They should be one of the best guard combinations around." 
</P>
<P>
Shimoyama (5-foot-7, 125 pounds) averaged 6.5 points, 7.2 assists and five 
rebounds a game at Louisville. North Hollywood was the Valley Pac-8 Conference 
co-champion last season. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Bill Scheffles pitched the first five innings to earn a win, had 
four hits and scored six runs as Santa Susana defeated Richmond, Calif., 27-6, 
in an elimination game of the U. S. Western Zone Pony baseball championships at 
Pleasant Valley Park in Camarillo on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana (9-2 in postseason play) will play the winner of Friday night's 
game between Camarillo and Cache Valley today at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Briggs was three for three with a three-run home run and Ryan Hankins had 
a grand slam for Santa Susana. 
</P>
<P>
Scheffles had four hits in his first four at-bats and scored six runs. 
</P>
<P>
Encino, which did not play Friday, will play Rialto today at 4 p.m. in a 
winners'-bracket game. 
</P>
<P>
Union City, Calif., rallied for four runs in the bottom of the seventh inning 
to defeat Conejo Valley, 5-4, in the Senior League Western regional tournament 
at Hadland Park in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-1, Union City scored three runs on Chris Dean's two-out double. 
Dean scored on consecutive singles. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Naster threw a five-hitter in a losing effort for Conejo Valley (14-4). 
Teammate Ryan Kritscher was two for three and drove in a run and Cory Bowen 
added two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Had Conejo Valley won, it would have faced Union City today for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Kendall, a 22-year-old UCLA student from La Canada, qualified 17th on 
Friday for the NASCAR Budweiser at the Glen road race in Watkins Glen, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, a former IMSA sports car champion who is making his first NASCAR 
start, qualified with a speed of 118.463 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Shepherd of Conover, N.C., covered the 2.48-mile, six-turn Watkins Glen 
International road course at 120.456 m.p.h. to earn the pole position for 
Sunday's race. The purse is $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
Emilee Klein of Studio City fired a final-round 80 on Friday to finish in a 
two-way tie for 11th place in the Betsy Rawls Girls Junior Championship at 
Hercules Country Club in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, a sophomore at Notre Dame High, had rounds of 74-80-80 -- 234 over the 
6,015-yard, par-72 course. Tonya Blosser of Athens, Ohio, won with a six-over 
222. 
</P>
<P>
Zack Lee of Thousand Oaks, 13, won a bronze medal in the parallel bars 
competition at the Pan American Cup, held last month in Victoria, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Lee represented the U. S. national team in the event and also finished fourth 
in pommel horse and fifth on rings. Lee trains at the Monarchs Olympic Training 
Center in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Herm Sater of Encino won a silver medal in age-group tennis competition last 
month in the Maccabiah Games in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Sater, 61, was defeated by Victor Israel of England, 6-4, 6-4, in the 
55-and-over division final. 
</P>

BRAVES' TRICK MAKES PADRES' WYNNE, WIN DISAPPEAR IN NINTH

Marvell Wynne might as well have been standing on second base naked. Maybe then 
he wouldn't have drawn as much attention, that some fans would at least have 
hidden their eyes in embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
But he was standing there in full view, in a Padre uniform, having formerly 
represented the tying run in the bottom of the ninth of the first game of 
Friday's doubleheader with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Now he was just the second out, another victim of the old hidden ball trick. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres lost, 6-5, and the thing that was both maddening and embarrassing 
for them was that after Bip Roberts' perfect sacrifice in the ninth, Roberto 
Alomar never got a chance to drive in the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was this: Roberts was thrown out at first by first baseman 
Darrell Evans, and second baseman Jeff Treadway, who took the throw, never 
returned the ball to reliever Joe Boever. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he walked toward Boever, all right, then flicked his arm and said, "Come 
on, let's go." Then he took his normal position. 
</P>
<P>
Boever knew immediately what was going on. So did shortstop Andres Thomas, who 
went to talk with Boever when Wynne didn't lead off right away. 
</P>
<P>
Second base umpire Bob Engel knew, too. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Treadway had the ball clear outside of his glove as he was walking 
back," Engel said. "He had it in his bare hand and cupped his glove over it. 
I'm surprised nobody saw it." 
</P>
<P>
When Wynne wandered off the bag, Treadway sprinted over and made the tag. Wynne 
never knew what hit him. 
</P>
<P>
He was unavailable for comment between games. 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre Manager Jack McKeon: "There was no purpose to him getting off base. 
Where are you going to go?" 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Atlanta attempted it this year, and Treadway didn't think 
of it until he took Evans' throw at first. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I decided to try it," Treadway said. "We need to do whatever it 
takes to win ball games. When I got the ball, the third base coach (Sandy 
Alomar) was giving him signs and telling him to pick up the outfielders. It was 
a good play. I thought there was a possibility it would work. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope there's not any kind of animosity for it. We're just trying to win 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Animosity? 
</P>
<P>
"Hell no," said McKeon, who still wasn't sure after the game ended what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest thing the Braves had to worry about was Boever's whereabouts. For 
the play be successful, rules say the pitcher can't be on or astride the 
rubber. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't be in a pitching-type position," Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
So Boever paced around the grass behind the mound, faced home plate, bent over, 
took a step onto the dirt and bent over again. Then Thomas came over for a 
chat. Finally, Wynne took his lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It took the longest time for Wynne to move off the bag," Engel said. "Thomas 
even caught that and ran to the mound to create a diversion. Finally, Wynne 
stepped off, and Treadway ran over and tagged him. When he made the tag, I 
turned to the pitcher to make sure he hadn't been on the rubber. Then I knew it 
was a legal out." 
</P>
<P>
Wynne stood on second base for the longest time, as if he could will himself to 
get out of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"He was kind of dumbfounded," Boever said. "I think he was standing out there 
like, did that really happen? There's nothing you can do but stand out there." 
</P>
<P>
Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar said he had never seen that play executed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock," Alomar said. "It's like, 'What the hell is going on?' But it 
happened. And that was the game." 
</P>
<P>
Treadway also played second in the second game. Animosity? Each time he batted, 
he was booed.

<P>
I agree wholeheartedly with Rosenberg's viewpoint. I was insulted for Higgins 
and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Why does television insist on using "tabloid attraction" instead of discretion? 
Why not grant Higgins dignity by showing a photo of him taken prior to the 
kidnaping? 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, there should have been a warning to viewers before showing 
the videotape of Higgins' hanged body. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and ABC both opened up their news program with a still photograph of the 
hanging. I wonder how quickly network executives would be to put on such a 
photograph if it had been one of their relatives? Sadly, I have a feeling that 
if it meant high ratings, they wouldn't hesitate.

ROB REINER'S DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Film lovers often complain that Woody Allen no longer makes the type of films 
he used to; films like "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan" are what these people want. 
</P>
<P>
Well, director Rob Reiner and writer Nora Ephron rectified this problem by 
making a film just like Allen used to make. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics claim the film is an homage to Allen. If the definition of homage 
has been changed to mean rip-off or copy, then, yes, "When Harry Met Sally . . 
." is an homage to Allen.

TV AND THE DEATH OF A COLONEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As much as I admire Calendar columnist Howard Rosenberg, he needs to rethink 
his position on the showing of the corpse of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on 
prime-time television ("Hanging Video: What Is TV's Role in Terror?," Aug. 2). 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg feels this portrayal was grotesque, obscene, unnecessary and 
dangerous. I agree it was grotesque and obscene, as are the Shiites who 
perpetrated the hanging and their "justice." As to unnecessary and dangerous, I 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
I ask Rosenberg to read Tom Clancy's op-ed article, also printed in The Times 
on Aug. 2, in which the novelist called for a hard line in responding to 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
After reading it, perhaps Rosenberg would perceive there is a need for 
Americans to view the cruelties of the world so we can deal with them. We need 
to realize there are bad people out there who want to hurt us. 
</P>
<P>
When dealing with people such as the ones who killed Col. Higgins during his 
captivity, we Americans need to call up our freedom-loving spirit and act, not 
send a "message" to those who are not listening.

ELDERLY JAPANESE INTERNEES WAIT FOR GOVERNMENT TO FULFILL REPARATIONS PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once before they were gathered together like this -- only in those days, nearly 
five decades ago, they lived behind barbed wire fences under the watchful gaze 
of rifle-toting sentries. 
</P>
<P>
Today, these 125 Japanese-Americans, who were interned at 10 relocation camps 
during World War II, are living out their final years at the Japanese 
Retirement Home in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Homes, Businesses 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the 180 residents of the five-story retirement home were 
incarcerated during the war because of their race. They lost their homes, 
businesses and farms because of suspicion that they threatened national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Now these former internees, some of whom are in their 90s, often sit in groups 
playing cards, watching television or knitting, and occasionally exchanging 
accounts of their days in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
As they walk with measured steps from their sparsely furnished apartments to an 
adjacent dining hall on Boyle Avenue, where they dine on Japanese-style rice 
and fish, several former internees recall those years in detention. They talk 
of promises made, but not yet kept. 
</P>
<P>
They are waiting for letters of apology from the U.S. government as well as 
monetary reparations of $20,000 per internee for the three years they spent in 
the relocation camps. But many wonder whether they will still be around when 
the apology and reparations finally arrive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Time Recalled 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't put another person through the hardships we had," said Dorothy 
Utsunomiya, 71, as she sat under the shade of a tree at the retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
The small woman, a widow who speaks with a tremble that comes from Parkinson's 
disease, recalled what life was like in the relocation camps. 
</P>
<P>
Utsunomiya was 24 when she was sent to a relocation camp in Gila, Ariz. She 
recalls being forced to live in horse stalls and enduring almost daily sand 
storms that lasted three hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"The experience we went through as American citizens was wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke, another elderly woman overhearing the conversation was surprised 
to find that they had shared the same camp but had never met. Both women 
expressed fear that reparations may not come. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to get redress before I die," Utsunomiya said, "(President) Reagan said 
that we would get it, but it's been a long time coming now. We may be dead 
before we get it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Money Appropriated 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the former President signed a law earmarking $1.25 billion to 
Japanese-Americans who lost their homes and businesses after they were 
interned. The funds were to be distributed over a 10-year period, but to date 
no money has been appropriated and not one former internee has received 
reparations. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the original 120,000 internees already have died -- and they 
continue to die at a rate of more than 200 a month, according to the U.S. 
Justice Department's Office of Redress Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 60,000 who were living on the day Reagan signed the bill, 
2,400 have since died. And, officials said, there are 16,000 -- like those at 
the retirement home -- who are over the age of 70. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day you look at the local obituaries and you can see people in their 
60s, 70s and 80s dying," said Bert Nakano, spokesman for the National Coalition 
for Redress/Reparations, a group considered largely responsible for raising 
grass-roots support for reparations. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Americans of Japanese ancestry 
-- U.S. citizens and aliens alike -- were rounded up on the orders of President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt and placed in relocation camps across the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shame Enforced Silence 
</P>
<P>
For decades, most former internees were reluctant to publicly discuss their 
experiences because they were ashamed and did not want to bring attention to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But the civil rights movement of the 1960s created an awareness of the camps 
among Japanese-American youth, and this awareness spawned the redress campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Now, because of publicity the issue has generated, former internees speak 
openly about "violations of civil rights" and of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the retirement home talk freely about the years they spent 
incarcerated in camps, which were lined with row upon row of Army barracks 
surrounded by guard towers. 
</P>
<P>
For Utsunomiya and her husband, Ken, the incarceration began 30 days after 
their wedding, and they were forced to leave their Santa Maria home. 
</P>
<P>
She said the mouse- and scorpion-ridden quarters in Gila, Ariz., did not 
particularly bother her. Nor was she extremely upset with the holes in the 
floor covered by tops of tin cans and walls patched with boards. She also got 
used to hanging sheets to divide the room that housed two families. 
</P>
<P>
It was her freedom that she missed. 
</P>
<P>
"There were guards in very high towers all night with lights and rifles," she 
said. "We could go nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
"They said that the guards and rifles were there for our own protection," 
another resident said. "But why were they pointed into the camps at us?" 
</P>
<P>
Partly to provide food, and mostly to add a sense of hope to an otherwise empty 
environment, the internees planted gardens and tended small farms around their 
barracks. 
</P>
<P>
Masato Uemura had once farmed carrots and green onions on a plot in North 
Hollywood before losing everything. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photos of Camp 
</P>
<P>
Uemura, 91, lives in a sterile-looking one-room apartment in the retirement 
home. He shuffles through the building with the aid of a metal walker. He 
eagerly shows visitors black-and-white photographs of the relocation camp at 
Manzanar, in the California desert, where he spent 18 months during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the Uemura family was separated, with seven of the children being 
sent to Tule Lake, Calif., while Uemura, his wife, and their oldest child were 
placed in a camp in Bismarck, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
Now supported by his children, Uemura said he hopes to see the reparations in 
his lifetime. He said he wants to give something back to his children for the 
years they spent at the relocation camps. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for my children," Uemura said. "We are Japanese, and that's why 
we were in the camp. If we were Chinese or (any) other nationality, we would 
not have to go." 
</P>
<P>
Retiree Tom Tsubone clutched a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Underlined in red 
ink was a portion of the Fifth Amendment that read: "No person shall be . . . 
deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law." 
</P>
<P>
Tsubone stopped reading and lifted his head. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what it's all about."

MAN SEIZED IN CAMARENA CASE IS KIN OF EX-LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis Echeverria has been 
arrested in Texas and is being brought to California for questioning in 
connection with the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, federal 
authorities disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Zuno-Arce, 59, was arrested Wednesday night in San Antonio by agents of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, according to Gary Renick, deputy 
INS chief there. He is to be brought to Los Angeles by federal marshals today, 
and sources said he will be questioned next week before a federal grand jury 
about the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spotted by Customs Agent 
</P>
<P>
Renick said that "an alert inspector" spotted Zuno-Arce as he passed through 
Customs in San Antonio after arriving on a commercial flight from Mexico on 
Wednesday afternoon. He said Zuno-Arce was on a special list of people believed 
to be drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said that at first they were unable to contact Drug Enforcement 
Administration officials in San Antonio. So they allowed Zuno-Arce to go to a 
home in San Antonio that he claimed he owned. When contacted soon thereafter, 
however, DEA officials said Zuno-Arce was wanted in connection with the 
Camarena case, according to Renick. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno-Arce was put under surveillance and arrested at a San Antonio supermarket 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, Federal Magistrate Robert O'Connor in San Antonio ordered 
Zuno-Arce held without bail as "a material witness" in the Camarena case and 
directed that he be immediately transferred to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor acted in response to an arrest warrant signed by U.S. District Judge 
Edward Rafeedie, who presided over a trial in Los Angeles last year that 
resulted in convictions of three men on charges stemming from the February, 
1985, murder of Camarena. Seven other men have been charged with murder and 
conspiracy in the case, including Mexican drug kingpins Rafael Caro-Quintero 
and Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo, both of whom are behind bars in Mexico City 
awaiting charges in Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signed Declaration 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also was presented with a signed declaration from DEA Special Agent 
Abel Reynoso explaining the government's interest in Zuno-Arce, who is married 
to Echeverria's sister. Echeverria was Mexico's president from 1970 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"Ruben Zuno-Arce has been identified by several informants, and in DEA 
investigative reports, as a major narcotics trafficker in the Guadalajara 
area," Reynoso said. "According to the informants, Ruben Zuno-Arce has made 
statements that he has knowledge about the kidnaping and murder of a DEA 
agent." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Reynoso said it is believed that Zuno-Arce has "valuable 
information" regarding the sale to Caro-Quintero of his former Guadalajara 
home, where Camarena was tortured and murdered. Zuno-Arce sold the home to a 
Mexican physician on Jan. 11, 1985, according to Mexican land records cited in 
Reynoso's declaration. The doctor was a partner in a Guadalajara real estate 
firm that sold the house to Caro-Quintero the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month later, on Feb. 7, 1985, Camarena was kidnaped, tortured and 
murdered. His body was found about four weeks later in a rural area in the 
Mexican state of Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Information 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso's declaration states that it is believed that Zuno-Arce has information 
regarding when Caro-Quintero moved into the house where Camarena was tortured. 
</P>
<P>
"This information would be extremely valuable to the government's case relative 
to forensic evidence, e.g. hairs and carpet fibers found at (the house), and 
that the hairs found (there) could not have been deposited prior to Rafael 
Caro-Quintero moving into the residence. Finally, it is further suspected that 
Ruben Zuno-Arce may have visited Caro-Quintero at (the house) and may have been 
a percipient witness to events surrounding the kidnaping and murder of Special 
Agent Camarena." 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Hernandez-Haddad, Mexico's consul general in San Antonio, said he 
believes that Zuno-Arce will be brought before a federal grand jury in Los 
Angeles that is investigating the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez-Haddad said he had had "a number of phone calls from Mexico City" 
about Zuno-Arce soon after he was arrested. He said he visited Zuno-Arce in 
jail Friday morning and found him to be in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
"He insisted he has no connection with criminal activity and needs a Los 
Angeles lawyer," Hernandez-Haddad said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors Move 
</P>
<P>
Gary Feess, the U.S. attorney, and Jimmy Gurule, an assistant U.S. attorney in 
Los Angeles, who prosecuted the three men in the Camarena case last year, asked 
Judge Rafeedie to issue the warrant for Zuno-Arce's arrest, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, at a memorial service commemorating Camarena's death, Gurule 
said that further indictments were expected in the case. On July 27, DEA agents 
in Los Angeles arrested Juan Jose Bernabe-Ramirez, a former member of the 
Jalisco State Judicial Police. An affidavit from a DEA agent stated that 
Bernabe-Ramirez had been present when Camarena was tortured and murdered and 
that he had helped Caro-Quintero escape when he was about to be apprehended by 
Mexican authorities shortly after the murder. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 9, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted Bernabe-Ramirez on 
murder and conspiracy charges in connection with the case. He is scheduled to 
be arraigned before a federal magistrate on Monday morning.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-MENTAL PATIENT FACES MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former mental patient was ordered Friday to stand trial in the slayings of 
two Universal Studios guards he reportedly said God told him to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper ordered Nathan N. Trupp, 42, to stand 
trial after a one-hour preliminary hearing in which a security guard and a 
sheriff's deputy described the Dec. 1 shootings and recounted Trupp's 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Soper ordered Trupp to be arraigned Aug. 17 on charges that he killed guards 
Jeren Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta and Armando Torres, 18, of Los Angeles after 
they turned him away from the studio. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp is also accused of slaying three people two days before the Universal 
City killings. Those killings occurred in a bagel shop near where he lived in 
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Abelardo Solarez, another studio guard, testified Friday that Trupp casually 
shot the two victims at the studio's main gate, shortly after they turned him 
away when he asked to see actor Michael Landon. "He kept saying that someone 
sent him to kill the two guards," Solarez said. "I asked him who it was and he 
said, 'God.' "

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEATH OF ARRESTED MAN INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are investigating the death of a suspect who was held in the back seat 
of a police patrol car after a violent rampage through a Sylmar neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Stephen Fisk said Friday that the death of the 
33-year-old man, who witnesses said was "frothing at the mouth" and screaming 
incoherently, appeared to be drug-related. Fisk said the cause of death will be 
determined after an autopsy and toxicology tests are performed. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose identity was withheld pending notification of relatives, was 
declared dead about 2 p.m. Thursday by a doctor at the Van Nuys Jail. Fisk said 
the man had been in police custody about 15 minutes when he died. 
</P>
<P>
By the time police arrived at the jail, officers realized the man had stopped 
breathing and they ran inside for a doctor, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was dead when the doctor got to the car. "It was that fast," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was arrested in the 15500 block of Bledsoe Street after he allegedly 
attacked an elderly couple who were getting into their car. Neighbors said he 
appeared to be fighting with a mailbox and stumbling through bushes in a crazed 
fashion, Fisk said.

NEWCOMERS GET A HANDLE ON SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
Nghi Tieu, an ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, speaks mainly Cantonese and a 
smidgen of English. But on Friday, the 16-year-old stood before a crowd of 
parents, peers and others and sang the opening lines of a Brazilian folk song 
-- in Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
It was only fitting. 
</P>
<P>
In an auditorium festooned with balloons, 220 students from a dozen countries 
-- most of whom had arrived in the United States only a few months ago -- 
celebrated the end of their first session at the Newcomer Center. The center, 
located at Crenshaw High School in Southwest Los Angeles, is a special Los 
Angeles Unified School District program to help newly arrived immigrants adjust 
to the U.S. education system. 
</P>
<P>
The master of ceremonies was from El Salvador, the pianist from Nicaragua and 
the choir from Vietnam, China and Mexico, among other places. Some students 
performed humorous skits to show off their newly acquired English, such as one 
about eating in a restaurant and finding a fly in the soup. One group of 
Chinese students offered a stirring dance symbolizing the struggle for 
democracy in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these kids are from troubled countries," teacher Guillermo Pasillas 
said, "yet they're able to forget about that here. I see a lot of enthusiasm 
and a lot of respect for education. They've been great to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Open since July 3, the Newcomer Center is one of two special schools for 
immigrants to be opened this year by the school district. The Crenshaw High 
center, which started with a six-week summer session, will enroll up to 450 
high school students in the fall for a yearlong program to help prepare them 
for regular high school classes. 
</P>
<P>
Instruction will be delivered in the students' native language for mathematics, 
language arts and U.S. history and culture. They also will receive intensive 
English instruction and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 elementary pupils are expected at a second Newcomer Center opening 
next week on the site of the former Bellagio Road School in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
The schools were the brainchild of former Board of Education member Alan 
Gershman, who proposed the program two years ago because he believed that the 
district needed to do more to ensure the success of the thousands of immigrant 
students entering its schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They were dropping out in huge numbers," said Maria Olmos, who directs the 
Crenshaw center, "and we wanted to make sure that they would continue on in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the newcomer students live near downtown Los Angeles and have taken a 
district bus to Crenshaw each day, Olmos said. More than 80% of the students 
are natives of El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala. But others are from Hong 
Kong, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the students emigrated with their families, about 10 left 
their country without kin and are supporting themselves, according to school 
psychologist Brad Pilon. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like 17-year-old Rosa Saucedo from Mexico, said they find the U.S. 
education system confusing and more difficult than schools back home. But 
others, such as Ambi Bangis, 15, from the Philippines and Bussarin Kiewkram, 
15, from Thailand, said they find the classes much easier. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to study," Ambi said.

'ABORTION ASSEMBLY LINE' BLAMED IN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles woman who died after an abortion at Inglewood Women's Hospital in 
1987 was the victim of "an abortion assembly line," in which a single doctor 
performed 74 of the operations in one day, the lawyer for her family argued 
Friday in Norwalk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments during a malpractice trial against the now-closed hospital 
and two of its doctors, attorney David Berglund said Belinda Byrd died because 
doctors rushed her through surgery and failed to notice signs of internal 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys said Byrd died from a rare blood clot that formed in her 
lungs several hours after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Three Doctors' 
</P>
<P>
"Had three doctors been standing there at the time, the chances of that woman 
surviving were practically nil," attorney David Weiss said. "This case doesn't 
belong in a courtroom. It belongs in a textbook." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's mother and three teen-age children are seeking damages, alleging medical 
malpractice against Dr. Steven Pine, who performed the abortion, the 28-bed 
hospital and its chief of staff, Dr. Morton Barke. The trial will resume Monday 
when the jury is scheduled to be charged by Judge Charles E. Frisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weighed 95 Pounds 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, who was 19 weeks pregnant at the time and weighed 95 pounds, sought the 
abortion because her doctor warned her that another birth could prove fatal, 
Berglund said. Byrd had undergone a Cesarean section in the births of each of 
her three children. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd was one of 74 women who received abortions from Pine on Jan. 24, 1987, 
Berglund said. After an abortion that took about nine minutes, Byrd was 
transferred to the recovery room, where she spent about seven minutes before 
being taken to the hospital's west wing, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund contended in the trial that it was unsafe for Pine to perform so many 
abortions in one day and that patients were rushed through the hospital so 
quickly that adequate monitoring of patients was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Inglewood Women's Hospital said it was not unusual for one of 
its doctors to perform 74 abortions in one day. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Women's Hospital specialized in late-term abortions. Most abortions 
are performed in the first three months of pregnancy. Byrd was nearly five 
months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's abortion ended about 4 p.m., and nurses noted on medical records that 
her condition became critical sometime after 7 p.m. In dispute is the quality 
of care she received in the intervening hours, the cause of death and whether 
Pine and the hospital contributed to it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lapsed Into Coma 
</P>
<P>
Byrd became unconscious and, after efforts to resuscitate her failed, she was 
rushed to Centinela Medical Center. Byrd went into a coma and died three days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's report concluded that Byrd died of a punctured uterus suffered 
during the abortion. While not disputing that a punctured uterus occurred, the 
defense argued that the hospital and the two doctors were not negligent in 
their treatment of Byrd. Defense attorneys said slides taken by the coroner's 
office after the original autopsy showed signs of a blood clot in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's death helped to prompt state health officials to launch an investigation 
of the hospital, which revealed what one official termed "battlefield 
conditions." The state revoked the hospital's license in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks later, the facility was reopened as West Coast Women's 
Medical Group, an outpatient facility specializing in abortions. Months later, 
it was purchased by Edward Allred, a Long Beach physician who operates it as 
part of his Family Planning Associates Medical Group, which runs numerous 
abortion clinics throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund argued that Byrd's condition deteriorated slowly from the moment she 
left the operating room but that her complaints of pain and weakness went 
unheeded by the hospital staff. Only when she went into cardiac arrest did the 
staff realize Byrd's desperate condition, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss and Robert Reback, attorney for Barke and the hospital, argued that a 
rare medical occurrence -- a piece of uterine tissue lodged in Byrd's lung -- 
led to massive clotting, hemorrhaging and eventually death.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS' REACTION TO SUPREME COURT RULING; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURES URGED TO RESTRICT ABORTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
Roman Catholic bishops have called on state legislatures to restrict abortions 
and cautioned abortion opponents about the dangers of internal political 
bickering. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy statement issued by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' 
Committee for Pro-life Activities, the hierarchy also said the abortion debate 
is being diverted from the issue of the "humanity of the unborn child" to 
questions of a woman's privacy and personal autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, "An Opportunity to Defend Life," is the church's first major 
analysis of the abortion situation following the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 
ruling upholding a series of state restrictions on legal abortion while 
ostensibly leaving untouched the key 1973 decision legalizing most abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"The new direction taken by the court is cause for hope," said the committee, 
headed by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago. "There is promise in the 
court's invitation to states to establish new legislative limits on abortion." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the bishops noted that the court "did not fully 
recognize the right to life of unborn children," and said the church must press 
its argument that "the evil of abortion begins with the humanity of the unborn 
child." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Central Truth' 
</P>
<P>
"This central truth is often obscured in the current debate, where abortion is 
presented solely as an exercise of personal autonomy or as a conflict between 
state prerogatives and the individual right of privacy," the bishops' statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of public policy, the bishops said the opportunities opened up for 
states to restrict abortion by the court's Webster ruling "are limited and 
complex." 
</P>
<P>
But it urged legislators to push for short-term goals such as placing limits on 
direct and indirect government funding of abortion, parental notification laws 
and efforts to delay and make "hasty" abortions more difficult to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to establishing constitutional protection for the unborn 
child to the maximum degree possible," the bishops said. "Therefore, we urge 
legislators, especially Catholics, to help build a consensus in our society in 
support of the unborn child's right to life." 
</P>
<P>
The bishops also took note of the deep divisions that have sometimes hampered 
the anti-abortion movement's efforts. The bishops, led by Bernardin, have 
sought to place their opposition to legal abortion in a context of "respect for 
life" that also includes opposition to the death penalty, support for 
anti-poverty social welfare programs and opposition to the U.S. nuclear arms 
buildup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Conservative abortion opponents, however, reject the bishops' strategy of 
making abortion a part of such a "seamless garment." 
</P>
<P>
"The movement in support of abortion on demand is united in its agenda," the 
bishops' statement said. "Pro-life Americans must not give their adversaries an 
easy victory by launching attacks on each other over questions of political 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The bishops also warned that the post-Webster debate could lead to a new wave 
of anti-Catholicism in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Anti-Catholic sentiment has never been entirely absent from the pro-abortion 
campaign," the bishops said, "but abortion rights advocates apparently seek to 
revivify it now that the efforts of Catholics and other pro-life citizens have 
begun to bear fruit." 
</P>
<P>
But the bishops said they "do not intend to be ruled out of this or any social 
debate by spurious interpretations of the 1st Amendment" that claim that the 
church is seeking to establish and impose its theological views of the fetus on 
the rest of the nation.

The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) has decided to build a new 
seven-story, limestone and glass headquarters building in downtown Indianapolis 
at a cost of $15 million to $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the need for major renovations in current offices, now housed in three 
separate facilities here, the 1.1 million-member denomination chose to erect 
the new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 participants in the denomination's general assembly last week 
joined in a celebration, "blessing" the new building site. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters staff numbers about 250. Construction of the building is 
expected to begin in late 1990 with completion in the fall of 1992. The Lilly 
Endowment, a funder of religious organizations, has made grants totaling $2 
million to assist in planning and relocation.

Members of a committee studying homosexuality for the United Methodist Church 
over the next three years are concerned about how their work is being viewed in 
the denomination, as well as what their report will say. 
</P>
<P>
This concern was expressed repeatedly during the committee's recent meeting 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members "have a real understanding that the issue is difficult and 
sensitive," said C. David Lundquist, a committee member and top staff person of 
the church's General Council on Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Some church members who believe that the Bible is clearly against homosexuality 
have complained that there is no need to study the issue. Committee members 
referred several times to "angry letters" they have received from members of 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite Unrealistic' 
</P>
<P>
"To dwell on Scripture alone . . . is quite unrealistic," said committee member 
James C. Logan, professor of systematic theology at Wesley Theological Seminary 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was created last year by the denomination to study homosexuality 
from theological, ethical and scientific perspectives. The committee's report 
is due in 1992 to the next General Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The church's official position says the practice of homosexuality "is 
incompatible with Christian teaching." The church bans the ordination of 
"self-avowed practicing homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
The committee heard preliminary reports on medical, psychological, sociological 
and theological aspects of the issue they will be studying throughout the 
three-year period. Leaders from a Denver group, Where Grace Abounds, which 
helps persons who are dissatisfied with their homosexuality, addressed the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Minds Urged 
</P>
<P>
Logan and others insisted that it is important for committee members to show 
that they are willing to consider many viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Several members said they will present the group with information contrary to 
the anti-homosexual beliefs of many church members. 
</P>
<P>
In one presentation, a New Testament professor, Victor Paul Furnish of Perkins 
School of Theology in Dallas, told committee colleagues that the Bible says 
nothing about homosexuality. Biblical references often associated with 
homosexuality refer to some homosexual practices rather than a life style, he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The term "homosexuality" was first used in 1869, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Values 
</P>
<P>
Other committee members criticized some contemporary Christian leaders who they 
say promote traditional family values that denigrate single persons and gay 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
In response, committee member J. Philip Wogaman, ethics professor at Wesley 
Theological Seminary, said the committee does not want its work "perceived as 
adversarial to the family."

NEW CYCLING LEAGUE STARTS ROLLING; 
</P>
<P>
PRO TEAMS TRY TO BUCK THE SPORT'S AMATEUR TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an obscure shop on Chicago's deteriorating North Side, racing bicycles are 
put together that may sell for $6,500. 
</P>
<P>
When Peter O'Neill of Pasadena heard about it, he was scouting for owners, 
riders and coaches to flesh out his new enterprise, the National Cycle League. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone serious about cycling passes that shop's portals sooner or later," he 
was told. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill already had a former Chicagoan aboard, John Vollbrecht of Eagle Rock. 
Both were scarred from politics and ready for something new. O'Neill had lost a 
bid to unseat Mike Antonovich in the supervisor race, and Vollbrecht had lost 
three challenges to Pat Nolan in the 41st Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill was able to interest Vollbrecht in taking the Chicago Fire franchise in 
NCL's professional racing circuit, and the new owner returned to his hometown 
to get acquainted with Ed Weissler, proprietor of the bike shop. A former 
competitor now partly paralyzed by a blow to the head while rescuing a woman 
from muggers, Weissler agreed to manage the Chicago team. 
</P>
<P>
If those sound like unlikely ingredients for a new sports program, consider the 
Los Angeles franchise. Putting together Team Wings brought in two co-owners who 
also had no previous experience with cycling or a sports venture. Robert 
Frazier of Chatsworth is the head of Frazier Aviation, a supplier in North 
Hollywood, and David Caldwell of Pasadena is an aeronautical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Executive director of the Wings is Frazier's wife, Susan, who is also a flight 
attendant; and the team's prime sponsors are Deryl Lichtenfeld and Tim Robley, 
otherwise engaged in marketing their line of professional hair-care products. 
</P>
<P>
The improbable list goes on, with interesting entrepreneurs coming aboard in 14 
other cities, and the cycling Establishment has variously branded the program a 
pipe dream and its 26-year-old commissioner, O'Neill, a loose cannon. 
</P>
<P>
But prophets of doom were somewhat chastened when, last weekend, the first race 
went off as scheduled in Boston. Four teams unleashed riders as a pouring rain 
slacked off, and New York blew the rest away with a 174-point finish. 
Pittsburgh was second with 50, Boston third with 32 and Atlanta last with 28. 
</P>
<P>
Seven cities are expected for the second race this weekend, scheduled to begin 
at 1 p.m. Sunday at the Veterans' Administration Center in West Los Angeles. 
Besides the host Wings, teams from Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans, San 
Diego, Houston and Seattle will be racing. 
</P>
<P>
Two races remain, Aug. 20 at Chicago and Aug. 27 at Dallas. Each of the 16 
prospective owners was expected to field a team in two of the four races. 
</P>
<P>
That's a substantial cutback from the original plan to open with a 10-week 
season and 20 teams, with two divisions and a championship race. Now the debut 
is referred to as a demonstration and there will be no playoff. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, however, remains optimistic that his idea will fly. 
</P>
<P>
High on the list of hurdles is the United States Cycling Federation, which 
sanctions amateur racing. Since the fledgling NCL doesn't yet have the 
financial base to attract top professional riders, it is getting started with a 
lot of good amateurs who suddenly see some hope of enjoying the dignity and 
perks afforded dedicated athletes in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill has been involved in a running battle with the USCF over sanctioning 
and penalties, which has cast a shadow over efforts to recruit riders. O'Neill 
threatened a lawsuit, then said a truce was struck in which he agreed to 
withdraw it, and Jerry Lace, USCF executive director, agreed not to threaten 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
But Stan Solin, a member of the USCF board and executive committee, said Lace 
has received no assurance in writing that the suit was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of a network TV contract led to another of O'Neill's problems, a mutiny by 
some of the new team owners. Described in one report as "the biggest television 
deal in the history of U.S. bike racing," it linked the NCL and NBC's 
Sportschannel America in a $6-million pact that promised live coverage of the 
races -- a first in cycling, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
That news helped bring in some top riders fearful of USCF threats to ban NCL 
participants from future USCF events. It also seemed to promise a lot of 
financial support from sponsors, but that didn't materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually a huge loan was arranged to get the first season under way, and the 
team owners were asked to back it. Many of them were reluctant, O'Neill said, 
but most signed. Two of them, however, contacted Sportschannel to request a 
delay of the opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
That apparently spooked the lender and made the cable firm leery, so the 
enraged O'Neill kicked the two owners out of the league and went after a new 
lender. That effort produced a loan at terms deemed exorbitant by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Because Sportschannel was insisting that the NCL use one of its producers, 
O'Neill said, at $30,000 a race, one of the owners finally suggested, "Why 
don't we just put on a four-race season the first year? We can raise that kind 
of money ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Concluded O'Neill: "It's been a good thing. The reality is that the first 
season, the owners have to go out and raise support locally, and that's what 
the program needs. It makes it truly a people's sport, with the communities 
behind each team. We have a new cable agreement that's better, with a family of 
three regional networks. It's a three-year deal, instead of the one-year with 
Sportschannel."

ATHLETICS' PHILLIPS MAKES MOST OF RARE CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
NO. 6 BATTER'S TWO-RUN HOMER IN SIXTH INNING HELPS DO IN WITT AND ANGELS 
</P>

<P>
With Mark McGwire and Dave Parker clearing the bases ahead of him most of the 
season, Oakland second baseman Tony Phillips hasn't had much opportunity to 
drive in runs. 
</P>
<P>
But he did Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips hit only his fourth home run of the season, but he made it count. 
</P>
<P>
His two-run blast in the sixth inning boosted the A's to a 5-0 victory and sole 
possession of the American League West before a crowd of 61,696 at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a home run in a long time, so this was really nice," Phillips 
said. "I think we're starting to be more aggressive. This is definitely a good 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who has 15 home runs, and McGwire, who has 20, bat ahead of Phillips' 
No. 6 position in the Oakland lineup. Parker and McGwire each had 66 runs 
batted in going into Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa has used Phillips in several spots throughout the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if it's first or fourth," Phillips said. "I'm only one type 
of hitter -- one who gets on base." 
</P>
<P>
Which means, of course, that Phillips usually comes to the plate with no one on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
And when there were baserunners, Phillips wasn't driving them in. He was 
hitting only .192 with runners in scoring position and had 29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
But after Parker hit a fly ball to left field for the A's second out and 
McGwire singled to center in the sixth, Phillips saw his chance. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips smashed Mike Witt's 1-and-0 pitch over the right-field fence, giving 
the A's a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Phillips put a good swing on the ball," La Russa said. "This was a good win. 
We had defense, pitching and timely hitting. That's a hell of a formula." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Carney Lansford tagged Witt in the eighth inning for a solo home 
run, his second homer of the season. Dave Henderson walked and scored on a 
double to right field by Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The A's needed Lansford's and Phillips' unexpected power. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Jose Canseco has been sidelined with a strained muscle in his right 
thigh since Monday. Parker had only three hits in his last 17 at-bats before 
Friday, and McGwire had 10 hits and only one homer in his previous 61 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday night, Phillips hadn't fared much better. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' homer, his fourth against the Angels in his career, was a bright spot 
in an otherwise gloomy stretch. He had only 11 hits in his last 62 at-bats 
(.177) entering Friday night's game, pulling his season average down to .245. 
</P>
<P>
Although struggling at the plate, Phillips has been one of the A's most 
versatile players in the field. 
</P>
<P>
He has played first, second, shortstop and third base this year as well as 
right and left field. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he was one of only two American League players to start at six 
different positions, and he played more than one position in a game 30 times.

SPURS' ROBINSON MISSES A MATCHUP AGAINST DIVAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anticipated meeting of pro basketball centers of the future didn't take 
place as expected Friday evening at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs and Vlade Divac, the Lakers' newly 
signed rookie from Yugoslavia, were supposed to face one another in the Summer 
Pro League. But the Spurs withdrew from the tournament, saying that they had 
accomplished what they wanted to in the league and that they had seen enough 
progress from Robinson, the former Navy star who until recently has been 
fulfilling his military obligation. 
</P>
<P>
In five summer league games, Robinson averaged 25.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and 
4.2 blocks. Robinson's best scoring game was Wednesday night when he had 36 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday, Divac had played in two games, getting 15 points, 12 rebounds 
and a blocked shot against Milwaukee, and 20 points and 18 rebounds against 
Denver-Sacramento. He also has had a total of 14 turnovers in those games. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs were replaced in the tournament by the NBA Stars, a team with several 
NBA players, among them Reggie Theus and Reggie Miller. DAN LE BATARD

BOXING / EARL GUSTKEY; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IN DOUBT, THE EYES HAVE IT IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The theme is a hundred years old: Aging boxer announces comeback, takes some 
beatings in tank towns, catches a headline, and tells everyone thanks, but he's 
pefectly capable of looking after his own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Camel's case, however, has another element. Turns out the onetime 
cruiserweight champion had detached retina surgery under an assumed name a 
dozen years ago in Los Angeles, and has fought 16 times since then. 
</P>
<P>
The California ophthalmologist who originally discovered Camel's detached 
retina admits today he submitted a false report on the injury, calling it a 
corneal abrasion. Camel had his retina repaired and promised never again to 
attempt to box in California. 
</P>
<P>
The California Athletic Commission has a hard policy on boxers who have had 
detached retinas. They can't get licenses here. Period. Nevada and other states 
employ case-by-case policies. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sensitive issue in boxing. No one wants another Sugar Ray Seales, a 1972 
Olympic gold medalist who today finds his way around Seattle with a red and 
white cane, blinded by eye injuries that went undetected for years because he 
memorized eye charts. 
</P>
<P>
Many opthalmologists point out that a boxer who's had successful retina surgery 
is at no greater risk for another retina injury than anyone else. After all, 
they say, Sugar Ray Leonard, Pinklon Thomas, Bob Foster and Earnie Shavers had 
retinas repaired and all continued to box without further injury, so far as is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Today, ophthalmologists appear to be interested in having more states adopt 
thumbless gloves than banning boxers with retina surgery histories. Most 
boxing-related retina injuries, they say, are caused by the thumbs on gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Minker, executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, said he 
would be more concerned about Camel's gray matter than his eyes, should he 
apply for a Nevada license. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have a problem with him," Minker said. "To me, more of a question in his 
case is, 'Where is this guy going?' At what point does someone say to this guy, 
'OK, that's it. No more.' " 
</P>
<P>
Camel, 37, recently applied for an Oregon boxing license, not knowing he would 
have to deal with blunt-talking Bruce Anderson, executive director of the 
Oregon Boxing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Anderson was asked if he would approve a George Foreman fight in 
Oregon. Anderson said he didn't like two things about Foreman: His age, which 
is 40, and his physiognomy, which is obese. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Foreman's advisers) to go perpetuate the George Foreman myth 
elsewhere," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Camel is a slightly different case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Camel is over 36, which in our state means his application gets special 
attention," Anderson said. Then Anderson learned of a Times story about Camel's 
detached retina. "He has passed some eye exams in recent years and he is having 
one in Montana this week," he said. "I want to see those reports before I make 
a decision. And he has a fight this week in Great Falls. I want to see a tape 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing, if Camel thinks he's going to come into this state 
and waltz through some medical formalities, he's mistaken. He'll think he's 
been through the Mayo Clinic before we get through with him." 
</P>
<P>
Camel himself said he has had 16 fights since the surgery. Dick Mastro, 
Southern California boxing statistician, has him losing his last four fights, 
since 1984. Virgil Hill, now the World Boxing Assn. light-heavyweight champion, 
knocked Camel out in one round in North Dakota in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The point is clear. Marvin Camel is going nowhere as a professional boxer and 
he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
So do the people around him. 
</P>
<P>
And so do the promoters who sign his checks. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sammy Fuentes-Rodolfo Aguilar super-lightweight bout at the Forum Monday is 
a rematch of the draw the two had May 15 in the Forum's tournament championship 
bout. The winner will earn $75,000, the loser $10,000. The World Boxing Assn. 
ranks Aguilar No. 1 and the World Boxing Council ranks Fuentes No. 7. . . . 
Roberto Duran, after he picks up his $7.5-million check for his appointment 
with Sugar Ray Leonard Dec. 7, has made an agreement with the Internal Revenue 
Service. Within three days, he will deliver a $1.5-million check to the IRS, 
settling his tax debt. The agreement also calls for Duran, who now lives in 
Miami, not to leave the country without notice. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Southland trainer Jackie McCoy says he has a young bantamweight 
prospect who bears watching, Martin Garcia. . . . Former heavyweight contender 
Earnie Shavers is moving to Lancaster, where he will be a field representative 
at the Inner Cities Youth Ministries Academy for homeless young men. . . . Art 
Aragon, the 1950s Golden Boy of Southern California boxing, is on the mend 
after falling off his roof recently and breaking his heel. 
</P>
<P>
It's featherweights Georgie Garcia and Luis Hernandez at the Irvine Marriott 
Aug. 28. . . . Lightweights Pernell Whitaker and Jose Luis Ramirez meet Aug. 20 
on ABC, in a rematch of their disputed match in Paris last year, when Ramirez 
was given a hotly disputed decision. Ramon Felix, Ramirez's manager-trainer 
throughout his career, recently drowned in a swimming accident near the 
fighter's training camp at Casablanca, Morocco. . . . HBO executive Seth 
Abraham is applying pressure on promoter Don King to free up Julio Cesar Chavez 
so that the long awaited Chavez-Meldrick Taylor bout can be made.

A federal judge has denied former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall's motion to get a new 
trial or overturn his conviction on nine counts of lying to a federal grand 
jury. Swindall, a Republican, cited pretrial publicity and argued that a 
statement by a prosecutor improperly focused attention on Swindall's failure to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
The perjury conviction was related to Swindall's grand jury testimony on 
negotiations for an $850,000 home loan from an undercover agent posing as a 
money launderer. He is to be sentenced Aug. 28.

2 ATHLETES HELD IN 3 SLAYINGS IN CLAIREMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities said Friday that an unusual display of public cooperation, 
apparently motivated by shock at the brutality of the crime, directly led 
police to the arrests of two suspects in the slayings of a Clairemont woman, 
her 3-year-old son and a man. 
</P>
<P>
In custody on suspicion of three counts of murder, police said, were two 
friends -- Christopher Clark Box, 20, of San Diego, a former star wrestler and 
football player at Clairemont High School, and a 17-year-old who is entering 
his senior year at Clairemont and is on the football team. The teen-ager's 
identity was not disclosed because he is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
Police alleged that the two, apparently motivated by robbery -- with possible 
drug overtones -- committed the killings Wednesday at the Clairemont duplex 
where all three victims lived. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were April Gilhousen, 20; Bryan Gilhousen, 3, and Kevin Morton 
Chandler, 29. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Kids' 
</P>
<P>
Hal Krupens, the football coach at Clairemont, described Box and the juvenile 
as "good kids" who stayed out of trouble, a sentiment expressed by others who 
know the pair. "This is just real hard to figure," Krupens said. 
</P>
<P>
At least three witnesses can place the two suspects at the site of the killings 
at 9 a.m. Wednesday, the approximate time of the slayings, said David Cohen, 
San Diego Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Box, being held at County Jail without bail, was taken into custody Thursday 
night outside a friend's house in Clairemont, police said, and the juvenile was 
arrested at his nearby home early Friday. Both were picked up without incident 
within a mile or so of the duplex in the 4300 block of Clairemont Mesa where 
the slayings took place, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed a number of tips from area residents who expressed 
revulsion at the killings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tips From Public 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the public was outraged that this happened," said police Capt. Bill 
Taylor, who cited specifically the slayings of Gilhousen and her son, who 
turned 3 on the day of the slayings. "People who might not normally approach us 
came forward voluntarily and gave us information." 
</P>
<P>
The result, Taylor said, was that police learned that a man named "Chris Box" 
had been seen in the area, and that a blue, late-model car matching the 
description of Box's vehicle had also been spotted. The vehicle, which has 
since been impounded, was allegedly used to transport the bodies of Chandler 
and Bryan to other spots along Clairemont Mesa Boulevard, where they were 
dumped and eventually found by passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied that we have all the suspects," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the assailants probably entered the home without having to force 
their way in, adding that Box probably knew Gilhousen. The killers may have had 
reason to believe that Gilhousen had $500 to $1,000 in cash at home, said 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash Recovered 
</P>
<P>
A "substantial amount of cash" was recovered from the juvenile, Elliot said. 
</P>
<P>
Box was described as an unemployed college student and formerly acclaimed 
wrestler, running back and linebacker at Clairemont High School, where last 
year he was named the top heavyweight wrestler in the San Diego section of the 
California Interscholastic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Box graduated from Clairemont in 1988 and started at inside linebacker last 
year with the San Diego City College team, according to Krupens. Box, from a 
middle-class background, was hoping to enroll at San Diego State University 
this year and win a walk-on spot on the football squad, Krupens said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely shocked," said Peter G. Schroeder, vice principal at Clairemont 
High, who described Box as a B student who kept up his grades and was 
well-liked. "He was not at all considered a problem student." 
</P>
<P>
Box is slightly under 6 feet and weighs about 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Heart' 
</P>
<P>
"He (Box) could have been a good ballplayer for somebody," said Krupens, the 
high school coach. "He has a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
The coach had a similar view of the juvenile arrested along with Box. "I don't 
understand it," Krupens said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, according to court records and David James, deputy San Diego city 
attorney, Box pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of selling alcoholic 
beverages without a license. He was fined $100 and placed on probation for one 
year, court records show. The incident apparently stemmed from sales at a 
party, said James. 
</P>
<P>
The possible involvement of drugs in the triple-murder case remained somewhat 
vague, but police said they were investigating several leads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigators Found Pipes 
</P>
<P>
Just outside the rear of the home, authorities said, investigators found a 
small amount of a substance, thought to be methamphetamine, that apparently had 
been dropped there. Two pipes, believed to have been used for smoking 
marijuana, were found inside the dwelling, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsies revealed that Gilhousen died of a stab wound to the heart and blunt 
injury to her head, and Chandler succumbed to head blows and a cut to his neck. 
Bryan Gilhousen died of head injuries and strangulation, according to the San 
Diego County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Gilhousen was found dead at the duplex, in the same room with her infant 
daughter, who was uninjured. Police say the dead males were transported to 
other sites along Clairemont Mesa Boulevard, where the adult was discarded 
first, and, some time later, the boy's body was placed in a carport. Their 
remains were found before the woman's body was discovered at the duplex 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons Seized 
</P>
<P>
Several possible murder weapons have been seized, said police, who declined to 
be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
Both suspects are slated to be arraigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, police had said they were seeking an unidentified man known only 
as "Roger," who had apparently answered the telephone at the Clairemont 
residence on the morning of the murders. However, police said they had since 
contacted Roger and determined that he was not involved in the slayings, and 
that one of the two suspects may have answered the telephone and identified 
himself as Roger.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: FALLBROOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kim Hughes, the Fallbrook woman who waited more than five months on a donor 
organ list for a new liver, was listed in critical but stable condition at UCLA 
Medical Center Friday after transplant surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated, 11 1/2-hour liver transplant concluded about 5 a.m. and seemed 
to go well, hospital spokesman Mike Byrne said. Ronald W. Busuttil, director of 
the UCLA liver transplant program, performed the operation that involved 
removing Hughes' liver, pancreas and part of her stomach before putting in the 
new liver. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, 21, was diagnosed with cancer in 1986. A rare, slow-growing tumor in 
her pancreas invaded the liver, and in February she was placed on a donor 
waiting list for a liver. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons did not replace Hughes' pancreas, Byrne said. Unless it is replaced 
later, Hughes will be dependent on medication for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are closely monitoring Hughes for signs of rejection and infection, 
Byrne said. Hughes could be out of the hospital in six weeks.

<P>
Participants in the fraud and tax-evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter began a 
three-week vacation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court case, in which Hunter is accused of 234 counts related 
to the giant J. David &amp; Co. Ponzi scheme, began April 18 after a three-week 
jury-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have so far presented more than 100 witnesses. Two jurors and two 
alternate jurors have been released because of family illnesses, work 
conflicts, and, in one case, for knowing a witness. 
</P>
<P>
When the trial resumes Sept. 6, federal prosecutors are expected to spend two 
weeks before resting their case. Hunter's attorneys recently said they expect 
to take about three weeks presenting their theory that Hunter was blinded by 
love for convicted swindler J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and was unaware of any 
fraud.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BAJA CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter, on a rescue mission to pick up an American heart 
attack victim in Mexico, crashed while landing early Friday on a remote 
airfield in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
The three crew members aboard the H-65 helicopter, Lt. Cmdr. Pat Gregory, Lt. 
(j.g.) Rod Lubasky and Petty Officer Anthony Juan, were unharmed, but damage to 
the aircraft was fairly extensive, said Dan Dewell, a spokesman for the Coast 
Guard in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old heart-attack victim was evacuated by a second helicopter and 
taken to Mercy Hospital, where she was in stable condition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter left San Diego on the medical mission about 11:30 p.m. Thursday 
and arrived shortly before 1 a.m. at the dirt airfield in San Quintin, about 
150 miles southeast of San Diego. During the landing, the helicopter toppled 
over on its left side, Dewell said. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard Falcon jet accompanying the rescue helicopter radioed for help, 
and a second H-65 helicopter was flown down. While it is not routine for the 
Coast Guard to perform these medical evacuations, it has been done before, and 
permission for this operation was granted by the Mexican government, Dewell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Naval investigators flew to the site Friday to determine what caused the 
accident and to bring back the original Coast Guard crew, Dewell said.

AWAKENING TO THE REALITIES OF BLACK LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On his way back from the makeup trailer, actor Danny Glover paused momentarily 
to let a small boy wearing a brightly colored warm-up suit run past his feet. A 
few crew members nearby looked on unconcernedly as the child crashed into his 
father, film writer and director Charles Burnett, and wrapped himself around 
his father's leg. 
</P>
<P>
Glover shook his head, smiling, and continued into the house to shoot his 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it annoyed some of the more experienced crew members who weren't used 
to having kids running around on the set," said Burnett from the production 
office of his film "To Sleep With Anger," which recently finished shooting in 
Adams Heights, near Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them told me, 'This looks like a day-care center,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Burnett's grass-roots project is not a traditional Hollywood 
production. 
</P>
<P>
The low-budget dramatic film -- about three conflicting generations of a modern 
black family who are pulled into the beliefs and influences of the past when a 
mysterious old friend from the Deep South pays a visit -- is expected to be 
completed for less than $2 million. The film features an experienced assembly 
of cast members who are all working for scale wages. (In fact, Glover's 
estimated salary for the current summer smash "Lethal Weapon 2" almost equaled 
this film's total budget.) 
</P>
<P>
"Outside 'The Color Purple,' working with an all-black cast is unusual to me," 
Glover said. "Certainly it's not new to me -- I've been around black people all 
my life." He laughs. "But in this business, I haven't, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this film means there will be more allowment for these kinds of films," 
said the quiet, soft-spoken Burnett, who wrote and directed the project. 
"There's always the concern that a film like this will not be commercial -- 
that was certainly the concern of the producers. That's why this film is so 
hard to do. But I think you have to keep eating away at it. Each film like this 
lays the groundwork for the next." 
</P>
<P>
The shoestring budget for "To Sleep With Anger" is nonetheless a treasure chest 
to Burnett, a 44-year-old film maker who has never worked with a budget of more 
than $80,000. The UCLA film school graduate grew up in South-Central Los 
Angeles. He won critical acclaim in 1977 for his self-financed $10,000 
production "Killer of Sheep," a stark, black-and-white examination of social 
values through the eyes of a black slaughterhouse worker. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too many movies about shootings and stabbings, where the only interest 
is to reduce human beings to butcher-shop byproducts," Burnett said. "It's 
nothing in a film anymore to see a person get their head bashed in or blown 
apart, and I think that's probably one of the reasons why there's so much 
violence on the streets today. Film makers have to take a responsibility and be 
accountable." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Burnett wrote and directed his second feature-length film, "My 
Brother's Wedding," and wrote several scripts for other independent film 
makers. His work rarely played outside of film festivals and art houses, but 
last year it caught the eye of the MacArthur Foundation, which awarded Burnett 
a $275,000, no-strings-attached "genius" grant over five years. The money 
helped the independent film maker to purchase medical insurance for his family 
and move them out of a small apartment into a modest home. 
</P>
<P>
Sony Video Software Inc., a film production arm of the Sony Corp., is financing 
"To Sleep With Anger." 
</P>
<P>
To keep production costs down, Burnett hired many crew members who had little 
or no experience working on feature films. Several more-qualified workers 
agreed to sign on for less because they believed in the project. In hiring a 
mostly black crew, Burnett said he was offering blacks an opportunity that 
Hollywood seldom presents. 
</P>
<P>
A profit-participation plan will compensate key cast and crew members for their 
lowered salaries, depending upon how well the film does at the box office. 
Glover's considerable financial stake, via his vastly reduced salary, earned 
him the title of co-executive producer in the film's credits. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it was such a low budget and the salaries were so low, we didn't want 
to embarrass anybody and ask them to work with us, unless they really wanted 
to," Burnett said. "I had worked with some of the people before. The whole idea 
was to build this team that really wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett said that one of the most difficult parts of making "To Sleep With 
Anger" was casting it, because there is such a tremendous amount of black 
talent who don't get many chances to showcase their skills in major roles. The 
casting call for the film attracted hundreds of hopeful black actors. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one guy trying out for only one line in a scene," Burnett said, "but 
looking at his resume -- I mean, the guy had years and years of schooling and 
training in theater. And he was pleased just to play this one scene." The actor 
got the job. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," about an escalating race riot in 
Brooklyn, "To Sleep With Anger" is not about racism but about a family's 
struggle to survive in a changing world. The film's cast is hoping that with 
the help of film makers like Lee, the theater door has opened far enough to 
permit a film starring a black family. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks usually play isolated roles in films, like the best friend, or the 
criminal, or the musician, or an extra," said cast member Richard Brooks, who 
was recently in the Vietnam film "84 Charlie Mo-Pic." "With a movie like this, 
when there is an all-black or largely black cast, then I can play the son -- 
the kid with the normal problems dealing with my mother and father. Those 
things are more real to me, as opposed to always being the loner, the outsider, 
trying to swim across the current and move through the world." 
</P>
<P>
When casting the lead roles, Burnett said he and his producers considered "just 
about everybody in the business." Glover committed to the project first. Others 
actors who followed: Mary Alice, Paul Butler, Carl Lumbly, Sheryl Lee Ralph and 
Vonetta McGee. 
</P>
<P>
In "To Sleep With Anger," Glover plays Harry Mann, who Burnett said is a 
folklore character handed down over generations from the Deep South. As a 
child, Burnett was told that if he went out to a wooded area alone, Harry would 
steal his soul. In order to keep that from happening, kids have to learn to 
out-wile him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those stories are traditionally kept alive more in the South," Burnett 
said. "I remember when I was a kid my grandmother used to tell me a lot of 
those stories. I don't know if that's happening as much today. I think there's 
this concern about losing that oral tradition." 
</P>
<P>
In his script, Burnett said, "the father, Gideon, tells his sons animal stories 
to instill old values in his sons. One son embraces his father's world, while 
his materialistic brother rejects it and chooses his own course. When Harry 
shows up, through a series of trivial conflicts that lead to life or death, he 
changes the whole nature of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the kind of trust that Charles has," Glover said. "You can see his 
silence and patience on the screen. He allows everything to unfold. It's like a 
flower you can't rush. It has to blossom." 
</P>
<P>
The producers of "To Sleep With Anger" say that they are taking a chance on a 
film by a little-known director whose subject matter may be too narrow for 
general audiences to find appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any film maker has to do films about his own experience, and if he's a 
great film maker, then that will translate into a universal subject," said 
co-executive producer Ed Pressman ("Wall Street"). Pressman is known for 
producing the early commercial films of directors such as Oliver Stone ("The 
Hand"), Brian De Palma ("Sisters") and Terrence Malick ("Badlands"). Last year, 
he approached Charles Burnett to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be crazy for Charles to do this subject and adapt it for popular 
consumption. It wouldn't be real to him and it wouldn't be his vision. And 
those are the things that make a film work," Pressman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This film is not about a white family," co-executive producer Harris Tulchin 
said. "I don't even know how you would fit a white person in here. What you 
don't want to do -- which I've seen done in the past -- is try to fit white 
people into a story about a black family just so you can say, 'Hey look, we 
have a white star. We can get much better promotion. We can get more people in 
theaters.' "

"There's always skepticism in these situations," said Mary Alice, whose 
performance in "Fences" on Broadway won her a best-actress Tony. "When we 
opened 'Fences,' nobody thought that a play about a black family would make it 
on Broadway. But look -- the play was a smash. Night after night, the audience 
was filled -- with whites and blacks."

THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic, ever eager to brave new cultural frontiers, 
couldn't muster 76 trombones for the concert at Hollywood Bowl on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the management did come up with seven -- count 'em, seven -- trumpets. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask your faithful, ever-befuddled scribe. 
</P>
<P>
The rather strange, rather vacuous, evening began with the entire orchestra 
assembled on stage for the national anthem as conducted by David Zinman, the 
accommodating guest-maestro from Baltimore. However, the Banner ritual was 
dispatched, con brio, by only the seven tootling soloists, their efforts 
occasionally punctuated by a dauntless drum-roller. 
</P>
<P>
After that, a third of the Philharmonic ensemble dutifully marched off stage so 
a modest Mozartean configuration could get on with the throat-clearing business 
of the "Prague" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The logistics proved confusing. The performance proved more notable for clarity 
than for charm. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was trumpet time again. Hakan Hardenberger, the Swedish virtuoso, 
served as splendid protagonist for the Philharmonic premiere of Henri Tomasi's 
Concerto of 1949, a sticky and dated melange of jazzy indulgence, movie-music 
pap and mock-Stravinsky pretense. With luck, it will turn out to have been the 
Philharmonic derniere. 
</P>
<P>
Intermission followed this anticlimax, after which the orchestra got another 
rest. The assembled trumpeters offered some crisp but inconsequential, 
eminently contrapuntal blasting on their own. 
</P>
<P>
In the modest flourishes of Heinrich Biber's Sonata (1668), Hardenberger was 
joined by a quartet of Philharmonic stalwarts -- Thomas Stevens, Donald Green, 
Rob Roy McGregor and Boyde Hood -- plus a stellar guest: Doc Severinsen. 
</P>
<P>
The Generalmusikdirektor of Johann Carson's "Tonight Schau" also participated 
in the flamboyant Baroque exercises of Johann Ernst Altenburg's Concerto for 
seven trumpets (1795), which required the additional services of Irving Bush. 
In both chamber-music excursions, Zinman beat time efficiently, Mitchell Peters 
thumped the timpani deftly and Zita Carno provided discreet continuo support on 
a portable organ. 
</P>
<P>
And what did this so-called trumpet summit have to do with a symphony concert? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
How did it project in a 18,000-seat amphitheater (with 9,097 in attendance)? 
</P>
<P>
Meekly. 
</P>
<P>
The underemployed orchestra got to mutter the last word, and not exactly a 
strenuous one, with Richard Strauss' short-winded and now-hackneyed "Till 
Eulenspiegel." 
</P>
<P>
The playing was fine. The amplification system cooperated splendidly. Zinman, 
ever efficient, conducted like a man who wanted to get out of there as quickly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
One couldn't blame him.

SAN DIEGO'S 'THIN AIR' IS A LITTLE TOO THIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The failure of "Thin Air: Tales From a Revolution," at the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre, seems all the sadder because the ideas it presents -- even those only 
half-crystallized -- are so terribly important. 
</P>
<P>
The playwright, Lynne Alvarez, is an American who spent her early 20s in 
Mexico, where she found out, to her consternation, that a seemingly innocent 
act -- in her case, starting a students' forum column in a local newspaper -- 
could and did lead to death threats for her and imprisonment for the man who 
was her husband at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Thin Air" picks up on the anxiety of the naive American who realizes, too 
late, that exercising ordinary American freedoms in a country in conflict can 
be tantamount to an act of war. In "Thin Air," the mistake is made by an 
American composer, in a nameless Latin American land, who unwittingly endangers 
himself and his child when he includes a love song by a revolutionary on his 
tapes of local music. 
</P>
<P>
Just the thought of last year's "Burning Patience" at the San Diego Rep and the 
recent "Dangerous Games" at the La Jolla Playhouse is a reminder of how 
wrenching the stories of the desaparecidos (the disappeared) in Latin American 
countries can be. 
</P>
<P>
"Thin Air" would be just as affecting had Alvarez brought the characters to 
life, but they never rise beyond the flat, two-dimensionality of sketches. It 
is hard to enter the reality of the pain of parents who have lost their child 
when you have never once seen that couple with that child. It is hard to 
believe in the couple's love for each other when their relationship is 
explained by the wife saying she likes music and the husband saying he really 
digs her. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue meanders into stories that neither deepen the characters nor 
advance the plot. Nor does it enhance the mood. And what is one to make of the 
composer's daughter who, when pulled from the lineup of those about to be 
killed, widens her pretty eyes at the soldier who saves her and tells him, when 
he asks to marry her, that she isn't in love with him, so it would never work? 
</P>
<P>
Director Sam Woodhouse struggles to lend shape to the action, which veers from 
nightmare to cocktail party to reality and back to nightmare, often without 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
Woodhouse does deliver some stunning visual sequences from this quivering 
chaos. Because of the thinness of the characterizations, the ensemble work at 
the elegant party and in the inferno of the prison -- where beatings erupt in a 
darkness artfully lit by Peter Nordyke -- provide the most memorable acting 
from a talented team that includes John Hertzler, Kat Sawyer-Young, Mickey 
Hanley, John Diaquino and Damon J. Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
The symbols loom large on D Martyn Bookwalter's twisting set with a theme of 
red and black -- love/blood/life and death -- established by the brilliant red 
carnations atop the gleaming black baby grand piano and continuing with the red 
and black of the family's clothing as designed by Nancy Jo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The skills of the design and execution, however, only serve to point up the 
unreadiness of the script and the inherent flaws in a system in which the 
desire to present a world premiere can result in a theater confusing a work in 
progress for a comprehensive work of art. 
</P>
<P>
What "Thin Air" needed was not this elegant production, but a workshop reading 
with a full mounting several drafts down the road. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday and 7 p.m. Sundays, with Saturday/Sunday matinees at 
2, through Aug. 27. At 79 Horton Plaza, San Diego, (619) 235-8025.

POP BEAT: GRATEFUL DEAD TO FANS: COOL IT

Is the Grateful Dead about to stop truckin'? 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the venerable San Francisco-based band is tiring of the road 
after nearly 25 years of concerts. The band's concern is that it may someday 
run out of places to play. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes between ticketless fans and police, as well as what band spokesmen 
describe as the "trashing" of communities hosting concerts, have put the Dead's 
future in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not particularly welcome in a number of places," said Dead guitarist Bob 
Weir. "The attitude within the band is that it's pretty much up to our audience 
to make it possible for us to play for them." 
</P>
<P>
Said drummer Mickey Hart: "If things don't progress, it does jeopardize the 
future of the Grateful Dead. We're in the hands of the Deadheads at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
The group -- which grossed roughly $30 million in 75 concerts last year -- 
feels so strongly about the situation that it is taking its case straight to 
its large corps of colorful and loyal fans, dubbed Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
The band has published pleas in the Dead fanzines Relics and the Golden Road, 
and aired them on radio and on the popular Grateful Dead telephone hot line. 
The message: "Act like guests, because that's what we are," as Weir said. 
Deadheads without tickets are also encouraged to steer clear of sold-out shows. 
Efforts are also under way to limit, if not flat-out prohibit overnight camping 
and vending on grounds near concert sites. The latter activities have caused 
community concern at some at Dead shows. 
</P>
<P>
To lessen the crush at shows, there may be more pay-per-view cable broadcasts, 
like the recent "Solstice" concert in Palo Alto. In addition, the band plans to 
tour Europe next spring, and possibly Asia this winter -- "to take some of the 
heat off (in the United States)," as Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
Weir has gone a step further. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an element in the people who follow us around that sells drugs," he 
said. "God knows we wish they wouldn't do that, but a small percentage of the 
crowd will buy, and that's all it takes to keep them going. . . . It occurs to 
me that the kids could get down on the drug dealers. . . . Don't patronize 
them! Just tell them to do something else for a . . . living." 
</P>
<P>
After the release of the band's hit 1986 album, "In the Dark," the Grateful 
Dead roughly doubled its legion of Deadheads. At an April concert in 
Pittsburgh, about 35,000 ticketless people showed up outside the show, 
prompting clashes with police. 
</P>
<P>
Said Weir: "At any time, it could turn really pretty bad. It hasn't yet. But we 
can't conscionably be causing those kinds of situations to occur." 
</P>
<P>
A combination of drug arrests, fans breaking fences to get in and sit-ins 
during the Dead's May appearances at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Laguna 
Hills have left future appearances at the facility in doubt, according to 
Irvine Meadows officials and Bill Graham Productions, which books the Dead 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Dead will be back, Matt Curto, general manager of Irvine Meadows, 
said, "Honestly, I can't answer that question. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Claire L. Rothman, general manager of the Forum, said there was no trouble at 
the Dead shows in February. In fact, she said, the group is scheduled to 
perform again in December. "The performers themselves and the organization are 
not only cooperative with what we want, but they make helpful suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
But some regular Grateful Dead tour stops are in doubt, Graham concert manger 
Bob Barsotti said, including Ventura, Long Beach and Palo Alto, as well as 
Pittsburgh, Saratoga, N.Y., Cincinnati, Kansas City, Hartford, Conn., and 
Worcester, Mass. Even the Dead's favorite hometown venues -- the Greek Theatre 
in Berkeley and the Henry J. Kaiser Auditorium in Oakland -- are, Grateful Dead 
officials say, "on thin ice" due to community objections. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis comes, ironically, at the group's commercial peak. "In the Dark" 
reached No. 6 on the Billboard album chart, propelling the Grateful Dead to a 
popularity that surprised the band members and the public -- and at the same 
time created the current problems. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, after 'In the Dark' -- boom -- there they were, and they were 
all 19 1/2, and they all liked to drink beer," said Calico, a member of the Hog 
Farm commune who has supervised Dead concert campsites since the early '80s. 
"They're rock 'n' rollers. They're not really Deadheads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the October release of the new Dead album, "Built to 
Last," Deadheads fear that another hit might spawn a new crop of novice fans. 
</P>
<P>
Said Weir: "If it is a hit, and it escalates the situation any further, that's 
gonna be that for arena shows. We'll have to play stadiums, and a number of 
those aren't up to having us either. And it shouldn't be that we have to play . 
. . stadiums." 
</P>
<P>
What do the Deadheads say about all this? 
</P>
<P>
"There has always been a party wing of the Deadheads," said Blair Jackson, 
publisher and editor of the Grateful Dead fanzine the Golden Road. "I remember 
1970, after 'Workingman's Dead,' being disgusted by all the people yelling 
'Casey Jones!' falling over drunk. It's always been there. It's just the scale 
has changed." 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Tickets go on sale Sunday for Don Henley's Sept. 26, 27 and 29 
concerts at the Universal Amphitheatre, and for Stevie Nicks' shows at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre (Oct. 14) and the Greek Theatre (Oct. 23-24). . . . Fine 
Young Cannibals will be at Irvine Meadows on Oct. 6. Tickets go on sale Sunday. 
. . . Tickets will be available Monday for the Doobie Brothers' Sept. 30 date 
at the Hollywood Bowl, for R.E.M.'s Oct. 18 Pacific Amphitheatre show, and for 
the MTV Awards on Sept. 6 at the Universal Amphitheatre. . . . An oldies show

STAGE WIRE: LYUBIMOV'S 'BORIS' FINALLY PLAYS MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years after the state censors said no, Yuri Lyubimov's production of 
Pushkin's "Boris Godunov" has finally opened at Moscow's Taganka Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Why was it banned? Vadim Gayevsky, writing in Soviet Theatre magazine, says 
that the reasons aren't quite clear even now. Supposedly the objections were 
that Lyubimov was up to his usual "antics," that he was treating Pushkin's text 
in cavalier fashion and that "doing 'Boris Godunov' without sets is all wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But now that the production is actually on the boards, Gayevsky finds that 
"these arguments hold no water: Pushkin's text has been reverently preserved 
and the delivery is better than any in living memory." 
</P>
<P>
So what was the objection to Lyubimov's staging of the play? Gayevsky suggests 
that the real problem was that it was too clear about Pushkin's ideas on state 
power and its corruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Plays about state power in crisis had long been banished from Soviet stages, 
with the exception of glib thrillers set somewhere in Latin America or South 
Africa. One could imagine the confusion that (the production) provoked in some 
officials and the panic in their offices." 
</P>
<P>
All this before glasnost -- of which Soviet Theatre magazine, under its current 
editorship, is a good example. The new issue has an editorial about Stalin 
("Debunked, he still strikes fear in us") and a long feature about Mikhail 
Shatrov, whose plays were also "hot potatoes" during the Brezhnev era, now 
known as "the period of stagnation." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine is published quarterly, in Russian, English, Spanish, German and 
French. For a subscription, write to VAAP, 6a Bolshaya Bronnaya St., Moscow 
103670. 
</P>
<P>
WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT: Like snakes discarding their skins, actors shed their 
last part without a qualm. Sometimes they're so relieved to be free of it that 
they start bad-mouthing the character. Here's Tyne Daly, in the Washington 
Post, on Mary Beth Lacey, her character on "Cagney &amp; Lacey." 
</P>
<P>
"Mary Beth wasn't a nice woman. Did you think she was a nice woman? I think she 
was a really limited woman with a lot of faults, a lot of bad stuff. She was a 
mud hen. What did she want? She wanted dining-room tables. She was afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Now Mama Rose, whom Daly happens to be playing in "Gypsy" this season -- 
there's a right-on woman. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: "A disaster is nothing more than a dumb idea that has gotten 
funded" -- James De Preist, director of the Oregon Symphony.

UNION MOVES CLOSER TO NEW CONTRACT AT ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians workers at 
ABC have voted for a new contract offer, the network said Friday, but 
ratification was held up by members of eight units who rejected the four-year 
pact. 
</P>
<P>
However, union spokesman John Krieger said that NABET hopes to have the matter 
resolved "within a couple of weeks, hopefully sooner" after joint meetings of 
union and management with the dissenting NABET members. 
</P>
<P>
The union -- which ABC says represents 2,150 full-time workers, the majority of 
them engineers -- said that the engineering contingent narrowly approved ABC's 
contract offer by a vote of 802 to 782. It gave no other vote totals. 
</P>
<P>
Under NABET's rules, all 19 of the union's units at ABC must approve any new 
contract. ABC said that the balking units represented only about 100 people. 
Included among the units that rejected the contract were two in Los Angeles, 
representing hairstylists and makeup artists and plant maintenance personnel. 
</P>
<P>
A similar rejection by several dissenting NABET units in 1987 delayed for a few 
days final approval of an NBC-NABET contract after a strike that had lasted 17 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of a strike at ABC this year didn't loom large after the union's old 
contract ended on March 31. Although ABC's first contract offer was rejected, 
no strike vote ever was taken. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract, under which ABC will be allowed to pink-slip 60 to 70 radio 
engineers, would give union members a 7% lump-sum bonus upon ratification of 
the contract, 3% pay raises in each of the second and third years of the 
contract, and a 4% hike in its fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the contract has not been finally ratified, ABC said in a 
statement that it was "extremely gratified" by the vote. "We've gained some of 
the flexibility we need while providing NABET employees with protections they 
sought," the network said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ABC television network and radio networks, the contract 
covers eight radio stations and four TV stations owned by ABC/Capital Cities, 
Inc., including KABC-AM (790) and KLOS-FM (95.5), and KABC-TV Channel 7 in Los 
Angeles.

HAYDN ORCHESTRA PLAYS PROGRAM OF ROSSINI, BEETHOVEN AND MOZART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes the best things come in less conspicuous packages. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night at McGaugh School Auditorium in Seal Beach, Alan Parker 
conducted the 29-member Haydn Orchestra in an ambitious program that consisted 
of Beethoven's light-in-character but difficult-to-perform Symphony No. 8, 
Mozart's boyish but virtuosic Violin Concerto No. 5, and a popular short 
opener, Rossini's "L'Italiana in Algeri" Overture. 
</P>
<P>
And for this penultimate concert of the 15th annual Seal Beach Chamber Music 
Festival, it was the modest Rossini overture that shone above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The winds supplied crisp articulation, the strings phrased each passage with 
lucidity, and Parker led with careful attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the players revealed his or her expertise with confidence and 
extraordinary control, resulting in a clean, satisfying performance. During the 
Beethoven, the ensemble bravely met the challenges presented by the many 
intricacies and eccentricities of the score. In taking all the repeats, Parker 
managed to make the pace fresh and vital. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it was a successful performance, but there were a few scattered lapses 
in focus that led to shortcomings in accuracy. There also was less brio than is 
usually associated with the piece, although the ensemble's gentler approach 
worked nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The auditorium demonstrated its unflattering dryness throughout. This problem 
didn't faze the players, which is all the more to their credit, as a chamber 
orchestra playing a Beethoven symphony offers an easy opportunity to expose any 
untidiness. 
</P>
<P>
Concertmaster Jean Hugo was soloist for the Mozart. Her performance, if a bit 
stiff at times (perhaps because of nervousness) was nonetheless engaging.

The Orange County-based James Harman Band has been nominated for awards in 
three categories by the Blues Foundation, a Memphis-based organization that 
sponsors the annual W.C. Handy Awards. The band's album "Extra Napkins" is one 
of 24 nominees for contemporary blues album of the year (the competition 
includes Robert Cray, Etta James and Willie Dixon). Harman, who plays 
harmonica, is one of 19 candidates in the miscellaneous instrumentalist of the

FIVE MUSEUMS GIVE WINGS TO THE FLIGHT FANS' FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
David G. Price says his fascination with airplanes started when he was 7 years 
old. He lived half a block from what was then known as Clover Field and today 
is Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It was during World War II and I used to go over to the field and watch the 
airplanes take off," says Price, 56, president of the new Museum of Flying. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were from England and as a little boy, I'd dream of flying 
Spitfires," he recalls. His dream came true: He eventually became a Navy pilot, 
and four years ago, he flew a Spitfire over the hedgerows and green fields of 
England. He purchased that Spitfire and another and brought them to Santa 
Monica Airport, where, after talks with Donald Douglas Jr., the idea of a new 
Museum of Flying was conceived. 
</P>
<P>
On the same site where Donald Douglas Sr. once built airplanes, the museum is 
part of an ultramodern complex adjoining the DC-3 restaurant and Supermarine, a 
fixed-base operator that services private aircraft at the Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Flying is one of five major air/aerospace museums in Southern 
California, where aerospace is a key part of the economy. Although operating 
independently, the museums are united in their reverence for vintage aircraft 
and frequently cooperate on restoration projects or loan planes to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Two museums, the Aerospace Hall at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry in Los Angeles and the Aerospace Historical Center in San Diego, trace 
flight from its beginnings into the Space Age. A fourth, the March Field Museum 
at the Air Force base near Riverside, is a military museum as well as a flying 
museum. And a fifth, Planes of Fame in Chino, offers a nostalgic look at famous 
"Warbirds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Douglas Artifacts Used 
</P>
<P>
Many artifacts from the Donald Douglas Museum were incorporated into the Museum 
of Flying, including furnishings from Douglas' boardroom with more than 60 
models of Douglas aircraft. Also, there is the drafting table where he created 
the likes of the New Orleans, a Douglas World Cruiser now hanging from the 
museum's ceiling, along with several other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Other Douglas planes on display include a DC-2, a DC-3 (widely acclaimed as one 
of the greatest aircraft ever built), a 1951 Navy AD-6 Skyraider bomber, an 
A-26 Invader bomber and a Douglas A-4 combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Price's British Spitfires also are on display. His Mk XIV served in the Indian 
Air Force and was rescued derelict from an Indian airfield in 1978. His Mk IX 
was assigned to the U.S. Army Air Force in Casablanca and may be the last 
surviving Spitfire that flew with American colors. 
</P>
<P>
A Curtiss JN-4D "Jenny" hangs over a display and video exhibit on wing-walkers 
of the post-World War I era when many Americans were introduced to airplanes 
through barnstormers at carnival-type air shows. 
</P>
<P>
Early air exhibits at the Aerospace Hall of the California Museum of Science 
and Industry include an airworthy replica of the Wright Brothers' Model B 
aircraft. The craft was used in a 1978 television movie, "Winds of Kitty Hawk." 
Later aircraft include a T-38 on loan from the Air Force, a DC-3, a DC-8 and a 
police helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
However, a major emphasis at this museum is space exploration. From Aug. 21 to 
Aug. 29, for instance, the Aerospace Hall will present live photos broadcast 
from Voyager II as it passes Neptune before leaving the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pictures Relayed to Museum 
</P>
<P>
"These will be the first close-up pictures we have of Neptune," says Eugene 
Harrison Ph.D., aerospace curator. "The satellite will transmit the data back 
to Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will turn around 
and broadcast what it is receiving via satellite. . . . Visitors to the museum 
will be seeing Neptune at the same time as the scientists at JPL." 
</P>
<P>
Special exhibits through Sept. 4 include "Visions of Space," 25 years of the 
space-probe photos recorded by JPL, and "Apollo 11 Revisited," a special 
tribute to the July 20, 1969, moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
The Aerospace Historical Center in San Diego also has space exhibits, including 
mock-ups of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space capsules. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits are arranged chronologically and start with a replica of a Wright 
Brothers plane, followed by World War I-era planes and a replica of Charles 
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Mail to War 
</P>
<P>
"We have an excellent exhibit on early airmail," says William Immenschuh, 
president of the San Diego museum board, "a barnstorming exhibit and airplanes 
of the '30s." These are followed by planes for sport flying and a special 
exhibit honoring the Flying Tigers for their activities in China during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Military buffs may enjoy a mock-up of a portion of the deck of the U.S. 
aircraft carrier Yorktown, a 1940s-era ship. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk onto the deck of the carrier and there are some American airplanes 
and a Japanese Zero and the ready room and the bridge of the carrier," 
Immenschuh says. 
</P>
<P>
Military buffs will also enjoy a trip to the March Field Museum. Originally a 
pilot training base, March later was a base for combat-unit training, a World 
War II fighter and bomber crew training base and a Strategic Air Command 
installation. It is now home for the 15th Air Force and SAC bomber and tanker 
units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey of Eras 
</P>
<P>
The museum reflects these various eras, from inside exhibits like the trainer 
"Jennies" to a U-2 spy plane out on the flight line. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibits inside include a P-59 (one of the first military jets), a B-1 jet 
engine split in half and positioned on opposite sides of the aisle, a ball 
turret that carried the belly gunner on a B-17 bomber, models of planes and 
missiles, cut-aways of engines, flight suits and other uniforms and other 
vintage planes. 
</P>
<P>
A full-size, cut-away cockpit of a B-47 used in the movie "Strategic Air 
Command" offers an inside view of this plane that was based at March through 
the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
From the museum, visitors can take a bus out to the "flight line" and see 31 
vintage aircraft, including the F-4, F-105, F-89, B-52, B-24, B-17, T-38, 0-2, 
B-47 and KC-97. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of all those airplanes are tied into March Air Force Base in one 
way or another," says Senior Master Sgt. Stephen P. Condos, director of the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Planes in Chino 
</P>
<P>
Military planes are also the foundation of the Planes of Fame at the Chino 
Airport. Sixty rare planes are crowded into two hangars, one additional 
building and surrounding grounds. 
</P>
<P>
A special exhibit of World War II Japanese aircraft includes a Mitsubishi 
A6M5-Zero, believed to be the only flying Zero fighter left, and a rare 
kamikaze suicide device, the OHKA-11, which was basically a piloted bomb. The 
OHKA-11 used rocket fuel and was carried by a mother plane and released a few 
miles short of the target. 
</P>
<P>
German warplanes include the Stormbird, a 1942 jet-powered ME-262A-1a Luftwaffe 
Messerschmitt and the Volksjager (People's Fighter), a Heinkel HE-162A-1 jet 
flown in the last days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's Soviet planes -- a MIG-15 and a MIG-17, which were acquired 
through a broker from Poland, and a 1947 biplane -- currently are the center of 
a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says the planes must be 
surrendered to Customs or sold to a U.S. military facility because they were 
purchased in violation of regulations forbidding transportation of military 
equipment from certain countries. Museum officials believe they have not done 
anything wrong and have negotiated a five-month reprieve to resolve the 
problem, according to John Maloney, a vice president of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Planes 
</P>
<P>
American planes displayed include a 1944 Ryan FR-1 Fireball -- with a 
combination of reciprocating (piston) and jet-power plants -- and an RB-26C 
Invader used in Korea. The Invader sports a Black Birds emblem lettered with 
the motto of reconnaissance crews: "Alone! Unarmed! Unafraid!" 
</P>
<P>
Fighter Rebuilders, a private company that restores the museum's planes in 
addition to private planes, works on the premises, and visitors can peer into 
the hangar. 
</P>
<P>
Locating parts is sometimes a challenge and often expensive, according to 
Maloney, who is also the restoration foreman. 
</P>
<P>
David Price says his Spitfires were "in pretty good shape" when he bought them, 
but previous owners had spent thousands of staff hours building them from 
"rusting hulks." 
</P>
<P>
But Price feels the end result is well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Our prime hope is that (people) get excited about what their predecessors 
created," Price says, "so when they leave they can say, 'You know, maybe I can 
do something like that too.' " 
</P>

<P>
IN PRO/CELEBRITY RODEO SUNDAY IN BURBANK, ACTORS AND OTHERS OF NOTE LIVE OUT 
THEIR FANTASIES BY TAKING PART IN AN AGE-OLD WESTERN RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's happened before, countless times, albeit under different circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
A young man has been programmed to go to college -- Duke University in this 
case -- to pursue a profession, possibly to enter politics. 
</P>
<P>
The young man has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Screwing up his courage, he prepares to beard his father. It's a busy day, a 
work day, and the father, with a trace of impatience, looks up from his desk: 
"Yes?" 
</P>
<P>
The young man clears his throat. "Dad," he says, "I don't think I want to go to 
college." 
</P>
<P>
No? What then? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go Out West and be a cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, Steve Ford recalls the scene. "You know how you always paid 
attention to your father when he shook his finger at you? Well, this was the 
world's biggest finger. 
</P>
<P>
"My father's office was the Oval Office. And when he stands up and the seal of 
the President of the United States is behind him, and the flags . . . somehow 
you take him a little more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Awed as he was, young Ford stood his ground. "Instead of enrolling at Duke 
three weeks later, I packed up my Jeep and headed West. It was the best 
decision I ever made." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Steve Ford -- rancher, breeder, actor; never far from horses -- will 
gallop full-tilt across the turf of the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in 
febrile pursuit of a spooked steer. So will actors Alex Cord and Richard 
Roundtree, and actress Kay Lenz, along with Patrick Duffy, Bo Hopkins, Linda 
Blair, Patrick Wayne, Clayton (the Lone Ranger) Moore, Doug McClure, Anne 
Lockhart, Chris Lemmon, Lee Horsley. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo champions such as Casey Tibbs, Larry Mahan, Donnie Gay and Hawkeye Henson 
will do the heavier work, astride the rampant rumps of broncs and bulls. (Not 
that the actor folk couldn't buck with the best of them, if they had a mind to. 
"Nothing to it," says a grinning Roundtree, who's just wrapped an oater 
entitled "Bad Jim." "They want a wild stallion broken, I just call the stunt 
double.") 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Ben Johnson Pro/Celebrity Rodeo in Burbank, open to the public, 
climaxes a three-day jamboree that will have included an auction, a "Taste of 
Texas" dinner and a country hoedown, all benefiting the Permanent Charities 
Committee and the Entertainment Industry. In past years, venerable 
wrangler/actor Johnson has rounded up celebrities and staged the rodeo at 
various sites throughout the country, raising more than a million dollars for 
the charities. This is his first in the L.A. area. 
</P>
<P>
No tinsel at the rodeo, though. Plenty of unvarnished bull. Plenty of 
fine-muscled horseflesh and quivering starflesh. And a rare chance to observe 
firsthand the durable affinity between horse and ham that dates back beyond 
even Tom Mix and Rod LaRoque. 
</P>
<P>
Cord, Hollywood's most articulate exegete of the equine mystique, is a man who 
never sits when he can saddle up. Along with acting, he has written -- and 
optioned -- a successful novel ("Sand Song") and a number of screenplays. All 
of which, he confesses, simply serve to feed his habit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of those people who was born with an affliction," Cord says: "an 
addiction to horses. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents put me on a pony at the age of 2 -- there's a photo of me grinning 
from ear to ear -- and I've never stopped. I've been riding for more than 50 
years, and I've competed, I think, in every equestrian event there is" -- 
dressage, racing, rodeo, riding to hounds ("I'm a whipper-in"), hunter/jumpers 
and "serious polo, a disease for which the only cure is poverty." Everything, 
in fact, but rustling, though Cord figures there's still time. 
</P>
<P>
Cord, who will compete Sunday in the roping and cutting events, grew up on Long 
Island, a mile away from Belmont race track. He dreamed, naturally, of being a 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd bicycle over to Belmont at dawn, before school. I'd hide the bike in the 
hedges, hop over the fence and hide in the bushes, just to watch the racehorses 
go by." In time he outgrew the dream, but never the ardor. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a potent, influential energy that comes from within the horse," Cord 
says, "and those who fall under its spell are the slaves of a grand passion." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Roundtree doubtless would put it a different way. Some men have 
etchings; others have horses. 
</P>
<P>
Roundtree grew up in New Rochelle, a posh suburb of New York, where he was a 
member of his high school riding club and learned to say RO-deo, not ro-DAY-o. 
("Ro-DAY-o's the drive, right? I mean, you say COWboys, not cowBOYS.") 
</P>
<P>
The equestrian bit, he reckons, is "regression to childhood, when we played 
cowboys and Indians, and watched Westerns: pretty romantic stuff." When 
Roundtree moved to Los Angeles after the success of his "Shaft" films, "I went 
crazy. I was single, a bachelor, and horses seemed to be the hip, cool thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up with six or seven horses, kept them all up at Victorville. I had my 
share of dates, you know, and it sounded pretty good to say, 'Why don't you 
come up and see my horses?' " 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in my life," he says, "I still ride and I still love horses. But 
I ride and love other people's horses." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's no Whinny the Pooh. "I'm pretty good," he concedes. "I can hang 
with just about any actor who rides." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Roundtree will compete in team penning. "There are three-man teams," 
he says, "and 15 or 20 cattle at the opposite end of the ring. As you cross an 
imaginary line, they yell out a number. You cut the three cows wearing that 
number on their sides out of the herd, bring them back to the original end and 
put them in the pen. 
</P>
<P>
"No, you can't whack the cattle over the head, or the horse either, for that 
matter. You can't even wave your hat. It's just a lot of yelling and screaming 
-- and horsemanship." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all done at great speed," says Cord, who also pens. "You ride in there 
and scatter the herd like a bowling ball." 
</P>
<P>
The cutting competition, Cord explains, is "just the opposite. You have one man 
(or woman) riding one horse. He goes into a herd of cattle quietly -- points 
are deducted if you disturb the herd. Your horse has to go in there like a cat 
sneaking into a family of mice. You nudge out maybe four or five cows, pick the 
one you want and the rest will drift back to the herd. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to this point you guide the horse, but then you have to drop your hand on 
the reins. From that moment, it's a contest between the horse and the cow." 
</P>
<P>
Cord, who's done it all, says cutting "is the most exciting thing you can do on 
a horse." 
</P>
<P>
Kay Lenz doesn't disagree. The actress -- riding three feet above the saddle 
after winning an Emmy nomination last week -- won the cutting event in 1984 and 
is gearing up for a second ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
She'll also be competing in the penning competition, one she didn't win the 
year she rode out with fellow actress Anne Lockhart. "There were three steers 
with the No. 1, three with No. 2, etc., and as we're riding across the line the 
guy yells 'Nine!' " Lenz recalls. "We're plowing through the herd looking for 
the 9s, and I don't see any. I shout to Annie, 'Do you see a 9?' and she shouts 
back, 'No, do you?' and the cows are milling about and we never did see those 
9s. Lots of 6s, though. They'd put the numbers on upside down. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of her fellow celebrity riders, Lenz, born in Hollywood and raised in 
the Valley ("when it was the Valley"), has been "around horses all my life." 
Riding is "very simple, very basic," she says, and "when you're bogged down in 
work, mentally harassed and you have to be here or there at a certain time for 
a certain shoot, there's nothing like getting on a horse and riding up in the 
hills for a spell." 
</P>
<P>
Lenz took lessons at the age of 6 or 7 at Glen Reynolds' fabled ranch: "He had 
Trigger there, and Rex Allen's horse, Cocoa, and the horse that was in the Ajax 
commercial. Cochise's horse and Zorro's horse. I got to ride 'em all." 
</P>
<P>
You'd think that by now Lenz would have starred in a Western, but "the closest 
I've gotten was riding behind Lee Marvin on his horse. Oh, and I did a couple 
of episodes of 'How the West Was Won' too." Earthbound, alas: "I was playing a 
hooker." 
</P>
<P>
When we left Steve Ford, scion of the Prez, he was heading West in his Jeep, 
young and restless. 
</P>
<P>
First was a job as cowhand in Utah, then another ranch in Montana, soon 
afterward a gig as a rodeo roper, a job in which "I was going to starve to 
death, bad as I was. But it was a great time of my life: You're carefree, 
you're in your early 20s, you're going from town to town, lots of good times, 
lots of good stories -- the kind of life that if you did it for more than three 
or four years you'd be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Ford has a pied-a-terre in Santa Monica, a ranch in San Luis Obispo and 
his own company, putting together partnerships in breeding and racing horses. 
Sunday, though, he'll be trying his hand again with the lariat. 
</P>
<P>
"Like many rodeo events," he says, "its origin (roping) stems from real-life 
situations. Say a couple of cowboys are out on the range in the middle of 
nowhere and there's a steer that must be tended to. They have to immobilize the 
animal first, so one ropes him by the horns and the other by the hind feet, and 
they stretch the animal out between the horses so they can give him an 
injection or whatever. That's what team roping is, and that's what I'll be 
competing in." 
</P>
<P>
Ford will be the "header," looping his rope around the horns, while a partner 
-- the "heeler" -- will try to time his rope throw for the instant the cow's 
hind feet leave the ground. "Heading is easier," Ford concedes, "but if I miss, 
the heeler never gets to show how good he is. The heeler always has an excuse. 
If I miss, it's embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Only temporarily. Now that the smoke has cleared from the Oval Office, Ford 
appreciates that his parents "allowed their kids to make their own mistakes -- 
or their own good decisions. The horse has changed my life, made my living. 
Hell, if it weren't for them -- and my folks -- I might be an orthodontist in 
D.C." 
</P>
<P>
Last word on riding and rodeos has to go to Alex Cord, simply because he says 
it best. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of mastering the horse," Cord says. "That's a 
misconception. What you do is marry a horse rather than master him -- so that 
you become part of the horse and the horse becomes part of you, and you come 
together as a third entity. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse's power then becomes yours, and you become godlike." 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices are: general admission, $10 for adults, $5 for 12 and under; 
reserved seats $25, box seats $50 and $100 -- all tax-deductible. Tickets 
available at Ticketron or at the L.A. Equestrian Center Box Office, 480 
Riverside Drive, Burbank, (818) 840-9063. Rodeo begins Sunday at 11 a.m. with 
the Grand Entry. The public may attend today's practice session at general 
admission prices only.

LANTANA SELLOWIANA: TRAILING LANTANA DROUGHT-RESISTANT FLOWERING GROUND COVER

The flowers of the different types of shrub lantanas come in almost all the 
colors of the rainbow. Clusters can be concentric rings of rose pink, baby pink 
and pale yellow. Or they can be the color of Trix -- lemon yellow, orange 
orange and raspberry red. Lantana species have been crossed every which way, 
and so the list of hues is endless. However, the ground cover trailing lantana, 
Lantana sellowiana, is available in only lavender-purple -- that is, it was 
until now.

According to Audrey Teasdale, botanist at Monrovia Nursery Co., Lantana 
sellowiana White Lightnin' (a trademark) has flowers of pure white. The buds 
are pinkish, and in cooler weather the flowers will show signs of their 
heritage by turning a little more purple. Flowering begins in April and 
continues until fall. 
</P>
<P>
For banks and berms, trailing lantana makes a very good, brambly looking ground 
cover (for each plant expect a spread of 5 feet and a maximum height of under a 
foot). The rumply gray-green leaves, under an inch and a half long with 
serrated edges, have an odor specific to lantanas that some people find 
astringent and others don't mind. 
</P>
<P>
The ground cover takes the heat well, will grow in any soil, is drought 
resistant and needs full sun to flower -- cold weather can stop bloom and cause 
leaves to fall off. Teasdale recommends drought-resistant companion plantings 
of a relatively new compact Leucophyllum frutescens, with purplish-pink flowers 
and silvery foliage. Or of verbena, to which lantana is related. Or of 
Hesperaloe parviflora ("like a skinny yucca," Teasdale says). 
</P>
<P>
Plant one-gallon containers 3 feet apart; they will fill in quickly. Give them 
good deep waterings until the plants get established, letting them get almost 
dry between irrigations. They may get mildew if they are in the shade, and they 
don't like to be over-watered or fertilized. 
</P>
<P>
Available starting in mid-August, one-gallon cans of White Lightnin' can be 
ordered by local nurseries from Monrovia Nursery Co. in Azusa. LINDA FRENCH

Etsuko Matsumoto doesn't look for perfection when she walks into her Monterey 
Park garden looking for blooms and plants to use in flower arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
If the edges of a green leaf are beginning to brown or the leaf has holes from 
a few hungry bugs, that leaf suits her -- and the Ohara School of Ikebana she 
represents -- just fine. 
</P>
<P>
A natural look, one that depicts a setting from nature, is an ideal to be 
pursued at Ohara, one of five major schools represented at the ikebana 
exhibition today and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Union Church, 401 East 
3rd St., Los Angeles, as part of Nisei Week festivities. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit by 25 members of the Ikebana Teachers Guild (Kado Kyoju Kai), from 
the Ikenobo, Ohara, Misho, Shofu and Sogetsu schools, ranges from traditional 
formal to present-day modern styles and includes works from several feet in 
height to smaller, table-sized arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ideas in the Garden 
</P>
<P>
But up until a day before any major show, Matsumoto usually has no idea what 
she or her Ohara colleagues eventually will create. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I do an arrangement, I'll think about what I want to do," she said in 
Japanese. "I'll have an idea, then I'll take a walk in the garden to see what's 
available." 
</P>
<P>
At this time of year, two favorite and available blooms are her miniature white 
daisies with yellow centers less than an inch in diameter, and what Matsumoto 
calls ho-o-zuki, or Chinese lantern plants, with orange, bulb-like blossoms 
about 3 inches in circumference around a small, black kernel of a seed (used as 
analgesic in some Asian cultures). 
</P>
<P>
Both blooming plants were grown from 2-foot-long root cuttings purchased from 
San Gabriel Valley nurseries, but the Matsumoto garden also includes rarer 
specimens from Japan, some grown from seeds, others from cuttings. About 180 
varieties thrive in a flat and sloping area in the yama-michi or mountain-view 
style. 
</P>
<P>
It's the greenery that Matsumoto depends on most heavily in the Ohara style. 
She began her garden because, while it's fairly easy to find and purchase a few 
blooms at the local florist for her arrangements, she said, very few florists 
can supply, for example, suitable dieffenbachia, tree ivy or the gnarled 
branches of pine. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I have root cuttings or a new plant, I start it first where I think 
it will look good and secondly where I think it will grow well," Matsumoto 
said. "Then my husband will come along and see it and say, 'No, not there! It 
will never grow there!' and he'll move it, often to a shadier spot. I don't 
know. He's the gardener. So far we've been lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Tsuyoshi (Bill) Matsumoto is a professional gardener who received his training 
after arriving in the United States in 1956. At the time, only one exponent of 
the Ohara School was teaching in Los Angeles, and Mrs. Matsumoto had been 
studying the Ohara style for nine years, having switched from the Ikenobo style 
in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are 96 students and four teachers in Ohara School's L.A. chapter, 
and Matsumoto is only one of seven ikkyu -- grand masters -- in the country, 
achieving the highest of five rankings in the school in 1986. Each year, grand 
masters are tested in their art. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Always More to Learn 
</P>
<P>
Despite her honor, Matsumoto said there's more to study and learn, including 
the modern free-style techniques, and many other plants she would like to bring 
from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The water plants do not do well," she said, pointing to a small cluster of 
hydrophilics in a koi pond. "Today you can see many different types of 
flowering plants and greenery in Japan that you can't find here." 
</P>
<P>
Various schools of ikebana claim that once students begin to grow materials for 
their own arrangements, their perception of the art form changes because, 
presumably, they see the growth process in their own back yards. 
</P>
<P>
"To see how a branch and a flower reaches toward the sun, how it angles in its 
growth, changes how we perceive flowers," Matsumoto said. In Ohara 
arrangements, one almost never picks flowers in full bloom for arrangements, 
choosing instead buds and semi-open flowers symbolizing the future rather than 
those depicting the present and past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Advance Discussion 
</P>
<P>
Other ikebana students and Kado Kyoju Kai teachers who will have displays this 
weekend may visit Matsumoto's garden to get plants for their arrangements, but 
true to form, no one discusses in advance what they plan to create. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has a different idea, so there's no duplication in our arrangements," 
Matsumoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Kado Kyoju Kai was originally formed in 1938 by seven ikebana teachers as the 
North America Japanese Flower Arrangement Teachers' Guild (Hokubei Kado Kyoju 
Kai) in Los Angeles. At the time, it was unprecedented for instructors of so 
many schools to form a group to promote the art. In Japan, where cooperative 
societies exist today, such a move was considered taboo 50 years ago; each 
school had worked separately and exclusively as tradition had dictated for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, founding members kept the art alive while living in 
internment camps, using whatever materials were at hand -- sheets of tin and 
salad bowls became containers and vases, weeds and desert sagebrush were used 
for greenery and nails pounded into squares of wood became the kenzan, or 
"frog" holders. Arrangements were displayed in barracks, classrooms and eating 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the group officially changed its name to Kado Kyoju Kai and has since 
remained active, trying to introduce ikebana to the American culture through 
demonstrations and exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
All seven original founding members have died, but among visitors expected to 
attend this weekend's exhibit is 98-year-old Katsuma Mukaeda of Van Nuys, a 
retired attorney who has advised the organization since 1935. It was at 
Mukaeda's urging that the ikebana society formed in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the Japanese American Chamber of Commerce, Mukaeda said: "To 
talk is not enough. Unless we appreciate the art and culture of each nation, 
there can never be peace and understanding."

HEZBOLLAH SHEIK PLEDGES HELP ON HOSTAGE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of Lebanon's fundamentalist 
Hezbollah movement, vowed Friday to use his influence to end the hostage 
crisis, but he said that it would take all sides working together and accused 
Washington of looking at the issue "with one eye." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Fadlallah complained that the U.S. government had not condemned 
Israel for abducting Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Hezbollah leader in southern 
Lebanon, the incident that touched off the latest round in the hostage crisis. 
Moreover, he said, the United States had inflamed the crisis by dispatching 
naval battle groups to Mideast waters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs Humanitarian Cause 
</P>
<P>
"We support the humanitarian cause of the hostages without any discrimination 
(as to nationality)," said Fadlallah, the leader of the pro-Iranian Shiite 
Muslim organization believed to be an umbrella for political kidnaping cells in 
Lebanon. "We are for the release of all the innocents who are detained, but we 
have to look at the problem with two eyes, not with one eye." 
</P>
<P>
At Friday prayers in Beirut, he declared: "Let's agree and seek together, each 
by his own means and influence, to end the crisis of hostages -- all hostages 
-- and end the issue of prisoners inside and outside." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said of Fadlallah's 
offer: "It's an interesting statement. . . . We hope it signals their desire to 
release the hostages." But he declined to make any more specific comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a position today where there really isn't anything new," Fitzwater 
said. "I think we would kind of like to lower our voices a little and let these 
issues play out for a few days and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials expect that little will happen on the hostage situation before 
next week, when Iranian officials are expected to meet with Hezbollah leaders 
in Damascus, Syria. Even after that point, Administration experts on the Middle 
East suggest that many weeks, even months, could go by before any final deal to 
free the hostages can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is planning to spend the next two weeks 
on vacation in Wyoming, and the Administration is considering deactivating the 
special hostage task force that it organized to keep track of the intensive 
diplomatic efforts that began after Obeid, a Muslim cleric, was seized July 28. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to swap Obeid and an estimated 40 to 50 Shiite prisoners in 
return for three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon and all foreign hostages, 
including eight Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Statements attributed to captors first demanded the return of Obeid in exchange 
for sparing the life of American hostage Joseph J. Cicippio, and later offered 
to free Cicippio in return for Obeid and 450 Shiite and Palestinian prisoners 
held in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the Shiite communiques, the last of which was released a week ago 
today, ever has offered to release the Israeli prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
After Obeid's abduction, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, a group 
affiliated with Hezbollah, said it had retaliated by executing Marine Lt. Col. 
William R. Higgins, an American seized in February, 1988, while on temporary 
duty as chief of the U.N. Truce Supervisory Organization in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told three U.S. congressmen 
visiting Jerusalem that he is optimistic about obtaining the freedom of the 
Israeli and Western hostages. 
</P>
<P>
In an hourlong meeting, Shamir said "he was hopeful what was taking place would 
lead to the release" of the hostages, according to Rep. John Hiler (R-Ind.), 
one of the congressmen. Hiler, Rep. Bob Clement (D-Tenn.) and Rep. Bill Emerson 
(R-Mo.) are touring Israel as guests of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai 
B'rith.

WHOLESALE PRICES FALL, SALES CLIMB; 
</P>
<P>
RECESSION FEARS EASE AS ECONOMY HITS MILD UPSWING

Wholesale prices fell again in July and retail sales rebounded after months of 
stagnation, the government reported Friday, a combination that suggests there 
is still plenty of running room in the economic expansion that began almost 
seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pushed down by widespread auto rebates and cheaper gasoline, the producer price 
index fell last month by 0.4% after a 0.1% decline in June, the Labor 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 0.9% in July as car 
buying revived, putting to rest any fears of an imminent recession. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only one month's evidence, but for now we've got the best of both 
worlds," said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Assn. of 
Wholesaler/Distributors. "The economy is not too hot, but it hasn't cooled off 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wall Street Rallies 
</P>
<P>
The latest economic data triggered a sharp morning advance on Wall Street, 
pushing the Dow Jones industrial average briefly to an all-time record high. 
But the rally ran out of steam in later trading, perhaps as traders discovered 
evidence in the retail sales data that interest rates may not continue to 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, the Dow had fallen 28.64 points to 2,683.99, and 
interest rates had risen. 
</P>
<P>
For now, experts agreed, with inflation easing and the sluggish economy 
experiencing at least a mild upswing, the Federal Reserve Board is likely to 
avoid any significant changes in interest rates when it meets later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed, which started relaxing its year-long tight grip on credit in early 
June, has been trying to slow the economy in hopes of engineering a "soft 
landing" in which inflationary pressures abate without a recession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bring Out the Champagne' 
</P>
<P>
"Alan Greenspan (chairman of the Fed) has pulled off what most of his critics 
said couldn't be done," said Michael K. Evans, head of the Evans Economics 
forecasting firm. "Bring out the champagne." 
</P>
<P>
And Van Dongen pointed out that Greenspan became chairman of the Fed exactly 
two years ago. "This is just what the doctor ordered," he said. "Happy 
anniversary, Chairman Greenspan." 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, where several officials have been worried that the Fed kept 
interest rates too high for too long, the latest economic reports were greeted 
with relief. 
</P>
<P>
The nation is on "a sound economic course," said presidential spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater. "Unemployment is the lowest in more than a decade; inflation is 
going down; growth is steady." 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts, while agreeing that recession fears were overblown, contend 
that inflation may be only temporarily caged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nowhere near as bad as the 1970s, but the U.S. economy is suffering from 
stagflation," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in 
Chicago. "The price of driving inflation back below 5% will be an extended 
period of high short-term interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back-to-Back Drop 
</P>
<P>
After racing ahead early in the year, inflation should remain moderate for at 
least the next few months, however. The 0.4% drop in wholesale prices, the 
steepest decline in two years, followed a 0.1% dip in June. That was the first 
back-to-back drop since early 1986, when prices fell for four months in a row 
because of a collapse in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
Before the recent two-month decline, wholesale prices had been rising at an 
annual rate above 9%. While the inflation rate for the year so far is now a 
more moderate 5.7%, that still exceeds last year's 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the producer price index stood at 114, which means that a basket of 
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $114 in July. 
</P>
<P>
The two most important factors pushing wholesale prices down were a 7.2% drop 
in gasoline costs and a 1.9% decline in new car prices. But analysts were 
encouraged that the core rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy 
costs, which are little affected by overall economic activity, fell by 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The retail sales figures pointed to an economy that has been stronger than 
previously thought. Retail sales increased to a seasonally adjusted $143.7 
billion in July following a 0.1% decline in June. But the surprising news was a 
sharp upward revision for May retail sales, which now appear to have jumped by 
0.8% rather than falling 0.1% as reported earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The revision showed that food and auto sales have been considerably stronger 
over the past three months than economists thought. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales led the advance, jumping 2.7% to $31.7 billion after a 1% decline in 
June. But even excluding autos, which make up about 20% of all retail sales, 
the consumer seems to have returned to the shopping malls. Non-auto sales rose 
0.4% after a 0.2% increase in June and a sharp 1.2% gain in May.

AIDING ISRAEL CAN PROVE DEADLY;

A LIFE OF BETRAYAL: DANGER STALKS ARAB COLLABORATORS

KIRYAT ARBA, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When you stop giving milk, they throw you away," M. said as he contemplated 
his plight as a petty informer in danger. "My friends in the security forces 
haven't helped me at all. I'm burned." 
</P>
<P>
M., an Arab from the village of Silwan near Jerusalem, is on the run. Branded 
as a collaborator, he believes he is being pursued by three Palestinian Muslim 
extremists who want to kill him. He cannot return to his home, where his family 
and neighbors condemn him as a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
Without support from the police, he has taken refuge here in Kiryat Arba, the 
most militant of the Jewish settlements on the West Bank. But he wants to quit 
his double life and convert to Judaism, become Israeli in body and soul, and 
change his name and the names of his seven children to Hebrew versions. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not feel Arab anymore," M. said as he adjusted his kippa, the traditional 
Jewish skullcap, worn at a tilt on his head. 
</P>
<P>
M.'s story opens a rare window onto the seamy world of collaboration, a subject 
of deadly significance these days in Israel, where informers in the service of 
the Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence service, are at the center of military 
efforts to put down the Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Palestinians have responded by undertaking a campaign of vengeance against 
suspected collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a day passes without a report of a brutal attack by an Arab on another 
Arab accused of betraying the Palestinian national cause. Suspected informers 
have been shot in hospitals, stabbed in the street, beaten by masked gangs, 
hung from meat hooks, thrown dead onto trash heaps, dismembered and mutilated. 
They have had their bones broken, their cars set afire, their homes sacked. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalist activists call these assaults "cleaning the Palestinian household." 
As Palestinians see it, collaborators have sold out to an alien power. The 
turncoats inform on neighborhood activities in return for money and privilege 
-- a permit to build a house or acquire land, rights to water, permission to 
travel. They act as intermediaries between Palestinians and the Israeli 
government, greasing the bureaucratic machinery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vulnerable to Blackmail 
</P>
<P>
Disdainful Palestinians insist that many collaborators have criminal records 
and are thus vulnerable to Israeli blackmail to keep prostitutes on the streets 
and hashish on the market. Worst of all, in the eyes of some Palestinians, the 
collaborators arrange deals that give away villages' communal land, which is 
growing scarcer and scarcer. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials say these charges amount to slander against "peace-loving 
Arabs." The victims, they say, are guilty only of wanting to live in harmony 
with their Jewish neighbors and of rejecting the uncompromising rhetoric of 
anti-Israeli die-hards. Left to their own devices, they say, these peace-loving 
Arabs would gladly accept Israel's offer of self-rule and get on with their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
The use of collaborators has been an open secret since the founding of modern 
Israel in 1948. Initially, informers were of paramount importance in 
intelligence work. They let Israel know what was going on across the border in 
the West Bank, which then belonged to Jordan, and the Gaza Strip, which was 
under Egyptian control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Petty Informers 
</P>
<P>
Contacts took place at border points, where information was passed secretly 
from Arab to Israeli. After the Six-Day War of 1967, in which Israel occupied 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the network expanded to about 1,500 individuals. 
Petty informers who spied on their neighbors' political activity and business 
dealings were derisively called "shtinkers" by the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years, Israel has needed to keep a closer eye on West Bank 
political trends. Who sympathized with the Palestine Liberation Organization? 
With Jordan? With Syria? 
</P>
<P>
Israel also began to buy up land, and there were widespread reports of 
collaborators making money by signing forged contracts. 
</P>
<P>
When the Arab uprising began in December, 1987, the drawbacks of relying on 
informers became evident. Israeli officials admit that the popular revolt was 
unexpected; years of investment in a spy network had proved next to fruitless. 
At the same time, the need for information from the occupied lands multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
Problems quickly arose. Many of the informers were already well known to their 
neighbors. They were ostracized, threatened and eventually attacked. Some made 
dramatic confessions at mosques. Others were driven off. More than 60 have been 
killed. The well of information was drying up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat of Revenge 
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials threatened to avenge attacks on informers and began 
to carry out manhunts of Palestinian activists suspected of leading attacks on 
collaborators. Some informers fled into Israel for protection, while others 
took refuge on army bases and in police stations. Still others, like M., were 
left to fend for themselves because they were not considered important enough 
to protect. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, everyone pretended not to know me," M. said, recalling visits to his 
police contacts for help. 
</P>
<P>
M.'s troubles began 10 years ago, when he was working for the Jerusalem police. 
In broad daylight he nabbed a purse snatcher in the Old City and turned him 
over to the police. Immediately, M. became the target of threats. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just helping to keep order," he said. "I don't feel I was some sort of 
traitor." 
</P>
<P>
He said a stipend from the police augmented the small salary he received as a 
guard at a Jerusalem hospital. 
</P>
<P>
One day, he was lifting weights at an Arab health club, where he was seen by a 
Muslim cleric. When M. left, the cleric switched a light on and off. It was a 
signal to assassins, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At least two gunmen followed M. up a street. He noticed them and tried to run 
away. Someone fired a shot, and M. was hit in the stomach. A resident answered 
his pleas for help and took him to a hospital. M. survived multiple wounds from 
a fragmentation bullet. The scars mark his belly in spirals. 
</P>
<P>
He was haunted by the shooting, afraid the assassins would try again. His mind 
was put to rest when, months later, the police called him and told him the 
gunmen were in custody. They belonged to a militant vigilante group called 
Islamic Sword. M. testified against them and they were sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
"They begged me for mercy," he said. "But I couldn't sleep while they were at 
large." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel released about 1,200 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 
return of three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon. Among them were the gunmen of 
the Islamic Sword. 
</P>
<P>
M. had gone back to informing, though he had little to offer because everyone 
knew he worked for the Israelis. One day, while M. was carrying out undercover 
watch duty near the Old City in Jerusalem, he encountered one of the bearded 
gunmen. The man publicly swore to Allah that he would kill M. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports of collaborator executions began to increase. M. grew 
fearful and went to the police for help. They told him they could do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, M. was walking past the Damascus Gate, the door of the Old City 
that leads directly into Arab East Jerusalem. Although he had grown a scruffy 
beard and wore his kippa, someone recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, there was a police van nearby and I ran to it," he said. "Otherwise, 
I could have been attacked." 
</P>
<P>
The incident frightened him. 
</P>
<P>
M., who is 31, had heard that residents of Kiryat Arba had taken an interest in 
the fate of collaborators, and he took refuge there. He is studying the Bible 
and hoping to convert. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to see the rabbis," he said. "They tell me to study more. They think I am 
not sincere." 
</P>
<P>
M. lives with his family in an apartment supplied by a resident of Kiryat Arba. 
It is bare except for a few inexpensive decorations. One, a heart with 
outstretched arms, bears the inscription, "I love you this much." 
</P>
<P>
His oldest son also wears a kippa, speaks Hebrew and plays with Jewish 
children. The others, and his wife, speak only Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
Kiryat Arba stands on the fringe of Hebron, a Muslim city in the southern part 
of the West Bank, and has been the scene of numerous clashes with Arabs living 
in surrounding neighborhoods. The Israelis there consider themselves in the 
vanguard of Jewish settlement and look on the Arabs as usurpers in a land 
promised to the Jews by the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Kiryat Arba militants have campaigned in favor of protection for 
collaborators. In Friday's issue of the newspaper Haaretz, settlement leader 
Naom Arnon was quoted as saying: "We absorb them because they are in danger. 
They were in danger because of connections with Israel, and the security organs 
did not take responsibility for them." 
</P>
<P>
Gush Emunim, a West Bank settler movement, has formed a group called Hand for a 
Friend to rescue collaborators. Gush Emunim has taken in three families in 
Kiryat Arba and several others elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
One family of refuge seekers from a village near Ramallah arrived a month ago. 
All 13 members of the family, including five children, are trying to convert to 
Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
The family was suspicious of a reporter who visited them and said their rabbi 
had forbidden them to talk. Haaretz said the family had been driven from their 
village because of accusations that they cooperated with Israeli authorities. 
One of the young male members of the family confided: "This is a secret matter. 
I work for the Shin Bet." 
</P>
<P>
Another told The Times: "Arabs who lived here were nothing when Jordan ruled. 
We don't want to be like the rest of the Arab world and live under a 
dictatorship. God willing, Israel will occupy all the Arab states." 
</P>
<P>
He said that by converting to Judaism they will gain an added measure of 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"Now when I walk into Hebron no one bothers me," he said. "They know where I 
live and there would be trouble if they harmed me." 
</P>
<P>
M. called on the family to share his religious lessons. He has taken on the 
responsibility of helping them prepare for conversion, and he gave them a gold 
paperback book of Talmudic studies. Some of the sons could read Hebrew, but the 
father and children stared at the books blankly.

STORMS GO ON; NEW AQUEDUCT DAMAGE FOUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Torrential cloudbursts continued to hammer California's deserts on Friday as 
officials reported additional damage to the flood-battered Los Angeles Aqueduct 
in the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
There were no new reports of major flooding from Friday's thunderstorms, but 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power officials called upon residents to 
employ water-conservation methods and warned that the new rains posed the 
threat of flooding that could prolong the already extended aqueduct repair 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concrete Walls Buckled 
</P>
<P>
Inspection on Friday of the aqueduct -- which supplies about 75% of Los 
Angeles' water -- revealed that the concrete walls along a 1,000-foot stretch 
of the open ditch in the Owens Valley about 180 miles north of Los Angeles had 
"cracked, buckled and popped" Thursday afternoon during the third day of 
thunderstorms there. 
</P>
<P>
DWP crews had already been at work in the area, beginning the massive job of 
cleaning out an estimated 100,000 cubic yards of flood debris that buried two 
miles of the ditch on Tuesday night, when the new flash flood struck. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Williams, DWP engineer in charge of the aqueduct, said Thursday's 
flooding exerted pressures outside the walls of the aqueduct that caused them 
to fail along a 1,000-foot stretch that either had not been buried or had 
already been mucked out. 
</P>
<P>
He said about 80 of the 10-foot-by-14-foot concrete panels that make up the 
walls of the 31-foot-wide channel failed. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to continue cleaning out the debris and (at the same time) repair, 
and in many cases completely replace, those panels," Williams said. "Our 
current estimate is that this will take about two weeks, working around the 
clock. But additional storms could cause additional damage or slow down the 
repairs." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP said that during the repair period, Los Angeles will continue to 
receive an adequate supply of water from down-channel reservoirs and through 
purchases from the Metropolitan Water District, which draws on other sources. 
</P>
<P>
A major thunderstorm dropped about 3 inches of rain within three hours Friday 
night in the White Mountains east of Bishop, prompting a flash-flood warning 
for northeastern areas of the Owens Valley, but officials said the flooding was 
not expected in the vicinity of the aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Friday evening's thunderstorm-caused rain was falling primarily farther 
south, in the Chocolate Mountains in Imperial County, in the Little San 
Bernardino Mountains in Riverside County, in the Coachella Valley cities of 
Palm Springs and Coachella and in the eastern Mojave Desert near Kramer 
Junction and Barstow in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times, said there would be "a few more" cloudbursts over the deserts 
again this afternoon and tonight, "but overall, the action should taper off 
during the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different This Year 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for summer thunderstorms to drench the deserts of the 
Southwest, but this year has been different. 
</P>
<P>
Yuma, Ariz., a community across the Colorado River from Southern California's 
Imperial County, was an example. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the most recent pair of back-to-back storms dumped heavy rain 
along both sides of the river in the Yuma area, city crews were working around 
the clock in steaming temperatures of up to 105 degrees to pump water out of 
flooded neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
Yuma residents assessed flood damage to 500 to 1,000 homes, most of which were 
unprotected by flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to recover from these storms for a long, long time," Yuma 
police spokesman Jan Schmidt said Friday. "We were totally under water." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Miller, city street division foreman, said his crews were "working 22 
hours a day, getting two hours' sleep. The heat, humidity and long hours are 
killing them." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents in this agricultural working-class community of 56,000 were 
salvaging what they could from waterlogged belongings, carting truckloads of 
ruined rugs, mattresses and couches to the city dump. 
</P>
<P>
Some had very little left to retrieve. 
</P>
<P>
Trying not to cry, Santiago Caballero said he saved for 10 years to buy a 
two-bedroom, $26,000 home that was virtually destroyed in the torrential rains 
that pounded Yuma on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost everything -- my furniture, my clothes, my car," said Caballero, a 
63-year-old farm worker, currently unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have insurance, but it doesn't cover flooding," Caballero said. "If the 
house would have burned down, I would have been covered." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sand in Swimming Pool 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of town, a shirtless Dennis McAlister stood with shovel in 
hand on a mound of sand that covered the $14,000 swimming pool he had built in 
his back yard in May. 
</P>
<P>
Back in July, the first of the two storms had hit Yuma, dumping about 2.5 
inches of rain, which is about the yearly average there. City work crews had 
bulldozed a 7-foot wall of sand to protect homes in the area from the flooding 
of a nearby canal. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Wednesday, as much as 5.25 more inches of rain pounded the city. The 
mound of sand collapsed in the torrential downpours and spilled over into 
McAlister's yard. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said he had little time to worry about the swimming pool then. 
</P>
<P>
"I was grabbing babies, dogs and clothes, just trying to get out of there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister is one of the lucky few who had flood insurance. But other problems 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we are going to have to build a sea wall on the west side of our 
property," said McAlister, a 41-year-old high school football coach. "We are 
hoping the city of Yuma helps us with this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making No Promises 
</P>
<P>
But city officials were not making any promises Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bound to get some claims in a situation like this, and we have every 
sympathy for these people," said Dan Dorn, assistant to the city administrator. 
"But our No. 1 concern right now is to get the water level down in residential 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
Pumps were running around the clock but water was still standing as much as 2 
feet deep in several streets and underpasses, although most homes were above 
the waterline by Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Dorn said ruptured water and sewer mains had all been repaired, and service was 
restored throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
He said that inmates from a minimum-security state prison south of Yuma would 
be deployed today to help clean the city's streets of sand and debris. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 miles to the north, in the Mono County communities of Benton, 
Chalfant Valley and Hammil Valley, residents were digging out after two days of 
flash-flooding that left about 30 homes damaged and much of the area layered in 
mud. 
</P>
<P>
Local California Department of Transportation Superintendent Loyd Hopper said 
Friday afternoon that as much as six feet of mud, sand and rock buried some 
stretches of U.S. 6, the two-lane highway that traverses the area. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Benton contributed food and blankets for a group of West German, 
Belgian and Dutch tourists who bedded down for the night in the town's senior 
citizens' center after their bus struck a rock hidden by floodwaters sweeping 
over the highway north of town and the vehicle's transmission failed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nobody's Complaining' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's taking it in stride and pulling together," said Carol Olsen, who 
runs the Benton Station cafe in Benton. "We're running low on hamburger buns, 
but so far, nobody's complaining about getting their hamburgers on bread." 
</P>
<P>
A few miles south, in the Chalfant Valley, it didn't rain, but the floodwaters 
washed south from Benton, where the cloudbursts fell. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer Bud Orris, 61, said Friday that the flood spilled down the valley "like 
a minor tidal wave." 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the wall of water coming from miles away," Orris said. "The 
first thing you see is the dust it kicks up in front of it. It takes it an hour 
or more to get here. . . . Last night, it was probably four feet deep in my 
son's house." 
</P>
<P>
Orris said that in addition to the damaged homes, hundreds of acres of crops 
were lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crops Ruined 
</P>
<P>
"There's some folks over there with a huge field of garlic just ready to pick 
and it's all gone," he told a reporter. "My brother-in-law at the end of the 
street has alfalfa all ready to cut and it's all laying down flat now, covered 
in mud." 
</P>
<P>
Four miles west of Benton, 68-year-old Marjorie Sirucek told how the 
floodwaters "came in my back door and went out the front, leaving a ton of mud 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
She shook her head sadly as she surveyed the mud-soaked carpeting and 
furnishings in her stone house, built in the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine the damages," she said. "I feel like crying, but I can't cry 
because I know I just couldn't stop if I did. So you just gotta laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Jenifer Warren reported from the Owens Valley and Louis Sahagun from Yuma, 
Ariz. Times staff writer Eric Malnic in Los Angeles also contributed to this 
story.

A new Soviet spy satellite exploded on July 28 when it went out of control in 
space, an industry magazine reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation Week and Space Technology said U.S. intelligence officials believe 
Soviet controllers deliberately sent a signal to blow apart the satellite when 
something went wrong as they were trying to direct it to a higher orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said the satellite, which it identified as Cosmos 2,030, was 
launched July 12 and said it was an "advanced reconnaissance satellite." 
</P>
<P>
It also reported that on July 18 the Soviets launched Cosmos 2,031, also a 
reconnaissance satellite.

NORIEGA ACCUSES U.S. ARMY OF 'INTIMIDATION' EXERCISES

PANAMA CITY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Panama Defense Forces accused the United States on Friday of intimidation 
and treaty violations, and the foreign minister said that Panama is "an 
invasion site in which only the order to fire is lacking." 
</P>
<P>
After three days of U.S. Army maneuvers and confrontations with Panamanian 
soldiers, the military issued a statement saying that the defense forces are 
facing "situations of intimidation and aggression by forces belonging to the 
Southern Command of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, the defense forces commander who effectively rules 
Panama as a military dictator, reiterated that he would not yield to U.S. 
demands that he step down. He marks six years as commander today. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama will not bow to the law of force that those barbarians from the north, 
their (Panamanian) lackeys and tame politicians are trying to impose," and will 
not "grovel" before the United States, he said in a speech to retired military 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that President 
Bush "would not rule out" seizing Noriega to face charges in Florida in a 
federal narcotics case but that the United States is not contemplating such a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's comments were his first public reaction to several confrontations 
between his forces and U.S. troops, which have included arrests on both sides 
and a blockade by American soldiers of Ft. Amador, a military base here shared 
by U.S. and Panamanian forces. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they have the right to conduct exercises under the 1977 
Panama Canal treaties to assure canal security. Noriega accuses the United 
States of seeking to abrogate the treaties and recover the canal. Under the 
treaties, all U.S. roles in the operation and defense of the waterway cease 
Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Ritter, asked the U.N. Security 
Council to send military observers to Panama to prevent the U.S. Army from 
provoking confrontations "as a pretext for armed intervention." 
</P>
<P>
"What the situation in Panama calls for is the presence of military observers, 
which we hope would be able to go as early as next Monday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Panama has become "an invasion site in which only the order to 
fire is lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert S. Okun, acting U.S. representative at the United Nations, said that 
all U.S. military activities in Panama are conducted "in complete accord with 
the Panama Canal treaties" and that recent exercises were a "response to the 
hostile actions of the Noriega regime." 
</P>
<P>
Washington has been trying to force Noriega out since two federal grand juries 
in Florida indicted him early last year on drug trafficking and money 
laundering charges. Noriega denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions have failed to budge the general. 
His regime annulled presidential elections in May after what international 
observers called a clear victory by the opposition ticket over the 
Noriega-backed slate.

NICARAGUA TELLING CONTRAS THEIR CHIEFS ARE QUITTING; U.S., REBEL AIDES DENY IT 
</P>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sandinista army, moving quickly to sow confusion among the Contras, has 
instructed its field units to spread word that the rebel command structure is 
collapsing in the wake of a Central American agreement to disband the 
U.S.-backed movement. 
</P>
<P>
The orders, published here Friday, are the first step in a campaign to woo 
rebel foot soldiers home under terms of the regional peace accord. They were 
issued after the Contra army's chief of staff and eight other officers applied 
for political asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
State Department and Contra spokesmen denied that the rebel leaders were 
abandoning their troops, saying that the asylum petitions were being granted to 
make them eligible for U.S. travel documents that facilitate movement around 
Central America on behalf of the anti-Sandinista cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Left Without Command' 
</P>
<P>
But the message from Gen. Humberto Ortega, defense minister and commander of 
the Nicaraguan army, said that the Contra troops have been "left practically 
without command or direction" and should be approached with offers of amnesty, 
personal security, land and economic aid if they disarm. 
</P>
<P>
"The supposed leaders (of the Contras) have assured their own political asylum, 
leaving the troops adrift in another display of opportunism, irresponsibility 
and cowardice," the Sandinista newspaper Barricada commented Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as Commander Franklin, countered 
with a statement to Radio Impacto, a Costa Rican station with close ties to the 
rebel movement. Interviewed in Miami, Galeano declared that "the struggle will 
continue," and a spokesman said he later boarded a flight to Honduras to return 
to the rebel camps there. 
</P>
<P>
"Galeano has not been fighting eight years just to get a green card," said the 
spokesman, Bosco Matamoros. 
</P>
<P>
The propaganda war is expected to intensify in the coming weeks as rebel 
leaders try to keep intact their army, weakened by more than a year of 
cease-fires and regional peace efforts, and as the Sandinistas try to hasten 
its dismemberment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the summit accord signed Monday by the presidents of Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, an international commission is to 
be named by the United Nations and the Organization of American States and sent 
to the rebels' Honduran camps by Sept. 6. The commission would then have 90 
days to achieve what the accord calls the "voluntary" disarmament and 
relocation of the rebels to Nicaragua or other countries. By Dec. 5, the 
Honduran camps would have to close. 
</P>
<P>
Contra leaders say they will try to keep their current force of 11,000 troops 
in Honduras while seeking still-undefined political concessions from the 
Sandinistas in talks to be set up by the commission. They say they might deploy 
many of those troops into Nicaragua before the December deadline rather than 
disarm. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Ortega's message focused on the 2,000 to 3,000 Contra troops already 
inside Nicaragua. It instructed the army to act with "discipline and 
responsibility" to protect the rights of any who choose to disarm but to be 
ready to "repel vigorously" any attack. 
</P>
<P>
He said the government will encourage a revival of independent local peace 
councils, made up of church and community representatives, in the war zones. 
Scores of such councils sprang up two years ago when the Central American 
presidents began working to end the Contra war, but they failed to persuade 
many rebels to lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time our troops are the target of psychological warfare 
by the Sandinistas," said Xavier Arguello, an adviser to the Contras' 
political-military commission. "Obviously, it could be demoralizing if their 
commanders are seen as retreating from the struggle, but I am not worried about 
morale. The vast majority are not going to be deceived." 
</P>
<P>
But some U.S. officials and other Contra leaders said they fear the summit 
accord will prompt most of the rebels to quit and try to enter the United 
States. "We'll probably end up with about 40% of the troops staying, no more," 
one rebel official estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Contra leaders are quietly asking how many rank-and-file soldiers will be 
allowed to settle in the United States as refugees, but so far the Bush 
Administration has not stated a policy. 
</P>
<P>
The nine rebels who applied for U.S. asylum Wednesday include six military 
commanders and three political advisers who had gone to Washington on Honduran 
travel documents before the summit to lobby for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Galeano and two others were given asylum Thursday, allowing them to move their

A British pub that refused to serve a thirsty customer unless he declared 
himself a homosexual agreed Friday to scrap its "gays only" rule. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Scott was livid with the barman at The Sun pub when he dropped into the 
bar in Bradford, northern England. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked for a lager and the barman said I could not be served unless I was 
100% gay. I was really angry; nobody should be turned away from a pub in those 
circumstances," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Sun licensee Adrian Thorley was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman for 
the brewery that owns the pub said Thorley had agreed to scrap the "homosexuals 
only" rule. 
</P>
<P>
"When a new man goes into a pub there always tends to be selective door 
control. However, we do not like pubs to become exclusive to anyone, and Mr. 
Thorley has assured us that this will not be the case from now on," the 
spokesman added.

ABORTION: IN EUROPE, IT'S LOW-KEY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
By American standards, the political atmosphere in Belgium should be crackling. 
It isn't. 
</P>
<P>
This staunchly Roman Catholic nation is one of only two countries in Europe 
that still legally prohibit abortion, yet it looks on a parliamentary struggle 
to lift the prohibition with indifference rather than emotional fervor. 
</P>
<P>
The country's only sizable anti-abortion pressure group, Pro Vita, has dusted 
off 10-year-old posters for its campaign. It plans no big rallies or 
demonstrations. People wouldn't turn out for them, group leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
And those who are pressing to lift the ban recognize the same limitations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Gives a Bad Image' 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to demonstrate," feminist organizer Anne-Sophie Van Neste said. 
"It gives a bad image. Letters, meetings, discussions -- that's the way to 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue, which generates passion and vehement protest in the United 
States, tends to be a low-key affair in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In both the mainly Protestant north and the Roman Catholic south, the abortion 
issue has rarely ignited the sustained public fervor or spawned the grass-roots 
interest groups that have made national power brokers of America's pro-choice 
and anti-abortion lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S., it is an issue on its own; here, it's just one more element of 
party politics," said Achille Diegenant, a member of the Belgian Senate and a 
key spokesman for retaining the ban on abortion. "It's not something people 
will go into the street for." 
</P>
<P>
Diegenant's Christian Democratic Party has lost two important committee votes 
on the bill that would legalize abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks of 
pregnancy. The party faces an uphill battle to defeat the proposal when it hits 
the floor of Parliament's upper house for a crucial vote this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's defeat could mean trouble for the country's Christian Democrat-led 
coalition government, yet any groundswell of public protest seems highly 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tension in Some Countries 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Europe has had its abortion debates: Protest and social tension 
have accompanied the lifting of abortion bans over the past 15 years, 
especially in Roman Catholic nations such as France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
But in most cases the change has been absorbed with only isolated pockets of 
resistance. Only in Italy has the issue persisted on a national scale. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-year-old Italian law permits abortion in the first 90 days of pregnancy. 
It has been the target of public protest and has survived a national 
referendum, waves of demonstrations and enough parliamentary infighting to 
topple one of Italy's 49 postwar governments. 
</P>
<P>
But even in Italy, American-style tactics such as boycotts against doctors who 
perform abortions or sabotage raids on abortion clinics are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the failure of West European anti-abortion groups to mobilize greater 
grass-roots support reflects the different type of democracy practiced in 
Europe -- a form of democracy dominated by parliamentary politics, with popular 
pressure groups operating only on the fringes of political debate. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental awareness, for example, may have come to Europe later than to the 
United States, but once this awareness began influencing the political agenda 
it quickly spawned the so-called Greens parties. These parties now press for 
change directly on the floors of nine parliaments in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Special-issue pressure groups in the U.S. have enough political muscle to 
dis-elect or block the nomination of key people," Eldon Griffiths, a veteran 
British member of Parliament, said recently. "That's just not a part of our 
political life." 
</P>
<P>
The inability to ignite public fervor on the abortion issue also reflects the 
relative weakness of church-based power in Europe. There is no politically 
powerful evangelical Protestant movement, no Moral Majority-type of coalition 
to mobilize national public opinion on such issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church is in the vanguard of the anti-abortion fight in 
Europe, but it has not been able to stir its rank and file to effective, 
sustained action. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the Irish Republic have voters in recent years responded to the church 
message, voting by a 2-1 margin in a 1983 national referendum to approve a 
constitutional ban on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
After two decades of gradual liberalization, Ireland and Belgium are still the 
only two European countries with legal bans still in place. 
</P>
<P>
"Those favoring legalized abortion in Europe are by no means as well organized 
as their American counterparts, but they don't have to be, because they hold 
the mainstream of political opinion here," Griffiths said. 
</P>
<P>
With rare exceptions, sensitive moral issues are viewed more as subjects of 
private choice than fierce public debate. Unlike American presidents, European 
leaders are not forced by voters to take sides on matters that are frequently 
considered outside the public debate. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
may preach her homespun homilies of thrift, hard work and clean living, but she 
sidesteps controversial moral questions. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen bills dealing with some aspect of abortion have been debated in the 
House of Commons since Thatcher took over as leader of the Conservative Party 
in 1975, yet few know where she stands on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a division between politics and moral issues here," said George 
Gaskell, a leading social psychologist at the London School of Economics. 
"Politicians try to steer clear of specifics." 
</P>
<P>
What protest there is at the grass-roots level in Europe often involves the 
United States. A group of 30 women who recently appeared outside the U.S. 
Embassy in London, protesting the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling restricting 
abortion, was made up of more Americans than Britons. 
</P>
<P>
And when Greece debated a liberal abortion bill two years ago, it was the 
American Pro-Life Society that helped organize rallies and distributed 
pamphlets in a vain attempt to block it. 
</P>
<P>
Many European anti-abortion advocates see the recent U.S. Supreme Court 
decision as a development that could finally swing developments in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look back one day and appreciate the significance of that decision in 
Europe," predicted David Alton, a British member of Parliament who failed last 
year to win passage of a bill limiting Britain's liberal abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
There is little evidence of a public eager to take up the cause, however. 
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, both sides seem drained by 10 years of haggling, stale argument and 
the fact that abortion is already commonplace in the country. Abortions are 
performed even in respected medical facilities, though technically in violation 
of the law. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, bills to limit the liberal abortion law have sparked heated debate 
in the House of Commons, but little else. There is no mass movement, little in 
the way of major protest and, so far, no change in the existing law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Financed Operation 
</P>
<P>
Britain's most vocal anti-abortion pressure group, the Society for the 
Protection of the Unborn Child, runs a well-financed operation from an office 
behind London's Westminister Abbey, but organizers reject as ineffective such 
tactics as mass rallies and public protests. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hold a rally, we get no media coverage," Paul Tully, the society's 
development officer, complained. "We've spent a lot of effort in the past 
organizing them and gotten nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of mass demonstrations, the group plans a low-key leaflet distribution 
campaign to mark the country's 3-millionth legal abortion since the law was 
enacted in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the type of tactic we have to use," Tully said. 
</P>
<P>
The French government faced no serious domestic political backlash earlier this 
year after ordering the pharmaceutical company Roussel-Uclef to resume 
marketing its controversial abortion pill RU 486, a product that anti-abortion 
militants have labeled "chemical warfare on the unborn." 
</P>
<P>
Roussel-Uclef officials said privately that the decision to suspend marketing 
the pill initially had more to do with the strength of American anti-abortion 
protest groups than any domestic difficulties. Roussel-Uclef's parent company, 
the West German chemical giant Hoechst, felt that its $6-billion U.S. business 
interests were jeopardized by threats of consumer boycotts, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Roussel-Uclef now sells the pill in France and next year may consider marketing 
it to hospitals and clinics in Scandinavia and Britain. But sale of the pill in 
the United States is regarded as highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who deal directly with the abortion issue in Europe find it 
difficult to grasp the intensity of America's debate. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent U.S. visit, Diegenant, the Belgian senator, was astounded at the 
high voter interest in the abortion question. 
</P>
<P>
"Legislators there said the voters' first question wasn't about taxes, new 
roads or nuclear waste," he said. "It was whether they were pro-life or 
pro-choice. That doesn't happen here."

BOTHA REBUKES LIKELY SUCCESSOR ON PLANNED MEETING IN ZAMBIA

President Pieter W. Botha threw South Africa's governing National Party into 
disarray Friday by announcing that party leader Frederik W. de Klerk, the heir 
apparent to the presidency, does not have his permission to meet later this 
month with Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse statement issued from his Cape Town office, Botha said he had no 
knowledge of the planned trip to Livingstone, Zambia, by De Klerk and Foreign 
Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, and that they had not obtained the 
authorization required of Cabinet ministers before traveling out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ministers Summoned 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who also serves as minister of white education, immediately summoned 
Cabinet ministers to a meeting and said that "it appears that there may 
possibly be a misunderstanding." He said ministers had been unable to contact 
Botha in Cape Town to arrange a meeting with the president to clear up the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the state-run television announced that a meeting of the full 
Cabinet, including President Botha, will be held Monday to discuss the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Botha's extraordinary rebuke of De Klerk, who is virtually certain to become 
president after the Sept. 6 elections, was seen by political observers as 
widening the gulf that has developed between Botha and the party since the 
73-year-old president suffered a stroke Jan. 18, and later was effectively 
forced into announcing he would retire.

A similar attack, in which no one was injured, was made on an Outjo military

SOME PASSENGERS AVOID TAKING FLIGHTS ON DC-10S

A number of airline passengers are asking not to be booked on flights using 
DC-10 jetliners after two explosive engine failures within a month on the jumbo 
jet, several agents and carriers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Since the July 19 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, that 
killed 111 people, about 400 customers have asked not to be booked on DC-10s, 
said Rob Doughty, a spokesman for United at its Chicago headquarters. Doughty 
said United carries a total of about 150,000 passengers daily. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonnell Douglas-built aircraft is used by about 50 airlines around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
There have been several other incidents involving DC-10s since the Sioux City 
crash, which followed an explosive engine failure. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the latest incidents, a Northwest Airlines DC-10 made a safe 
emergency landing Thursday in Denver after an "uncontained engine failure" in 
which flying parts punched holes in the housing of the airliner's tail-mounted 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest has worked with about 25 customers who have expressed concern about 
the aircraft, said Bob Gibbons, a Northwest spokesman in Eagan, Minn. As a 
matter of policy, Northwest will not allow changes of aircraft on discount 
tickets where any changes normally are prohibited, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
At United, nearly all fliers expressing aircraft preferences are accommodated, 
unless the only choice on a particular route is the DC-10, Doughty said. Even 
requests by passengers with discount-fare tickets -- which usually prohibit 
changes in flight plans -- are being granted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the worried customers are vacationers and other leisure passengers, 
as opposed to seasoned business travelers, both airlines and agents say. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Edelman, an agent at JB's World Travel in Manhattan, reported about a 
quarter of the agency's customers are requesting non-DC-10 flights. 
</P>
<P>
Other travel agents, like William Cooper in Pompano Beach, Fla., say they are 
seeing more apprehension about air safety in general, not limited to specific 
types of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
That concern has been heightened by other recent incidents involving aging 
aircraft.

JUSTICE DEPT. JOINS LAWSUIT TO BLOCK DISMANTLING OF N.Y. NUCLEAR PLANT

The Justice Department joined in a lawsuit Friday aimed at blocking the 
dismantling of the Shoreham nuclear power plant in New York, arguing that the 
state failed to follow its own procedures for safeguarding the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The intervention in a state court came on behalf of the Energy Department, 
which has strongly opposed the shutdown of the 813-megawatt plant on Long 
Island on the grounds that it is needed to meet the region's electricity needs. 
</P>
<P>
W. Henson Moore, deputy energy secretary, said the Justice Department is 
arguing that the New York Power Authority and the state Public Service 
Commission should have prepared formal environmental impact statements before 
approving the dismantling plan. 
</P>
<P>
Moore called the plant "safe, efficient, and much-needed" and said its closure 
would require the region to rely more heavily on fossil fuel, which in turn 
will have "adverse environmental consequences" because of emissions that 
contribute to acid rain and may lead to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in the suit are some Long Island residents and a group called 
Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy.

NORTH WOULD GET PRISON TERM UNDER NEW RULES, ARTICLE SAYS

<P>
Had federal sentencing guidelines been applied to Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra 
case, the recommended punishment would have been a prison term of at least 21 
months, according to a published analysis. 
</P>
<P>
North, convicted last spring of committing three felonies when working at the 
White House in 1986, was fined, put on probation and ordered to do community 
service -- but was sentenced to no jail time. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, which recommend ranges of possible sentences to judges, were 
not applied to the North case because they cover only federal crimes committed 
after Nov. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
If North's actions had occurred after that date, calculations under the 
guidelines "would produce a sentence range of 21-27 months in prison on the low 
end, and a range of 46-57 months in prison on the high end," an article by the 
editors of the Federal Sentencing Reporter concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit publication is circulated among federal judges, probation 
officers, law professors and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
North was convicted of aiding and abetting obstruction of Congress, destroying 
government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. 
</P>
<P>
The length of a recommended sentence under the guidelines in the North case 
would depend partly on a judge's decision as to whether the former White House 
aide had substantially interfered with the administration of justice, the 
article said. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors in determining the severity of punishment would be the value 
assigned to classified documents that North destroyed, whether he was a major 
or minor participant in the crime of aiding the obstruction of Congress and 
whether he was considered to be in a high-level decision-making capacity, the 
article said. 
</P>
<P>
If North's had been a guidelines case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell 
still could have imposed no jail time but the prosecution would have been able 
to appeal such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Before North's sentencing, prosecutors recommended an unspecified jail term, 
Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman in the office of independent counsel Lawrence E. 
Walsh, noted when asked to comment on the new analysis. North's attorney, 
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., was out of his office and unavailable for comment, a 
secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
At the sentencing, Gesell told North that he lacked a "full understanding . . . 
of how the public service has been tarnished" and that "jail would only harden 
your misconceptions." The judge said that community service may leave North 
more conscious of values that, at times, "you and your associates appear to 
have overlooked in the elite isolation of the White House."

years ago -- the night his father reportedly came home drunk, beat the boy's 
mother and then was shot to death by the boy's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who was on life support Friday night at Palomar Medical Center after 
being declared brain dead, was a teen-ager at the time his father was killed in 
the mid-1950s, in the family's small farm home in central Missouri, according 
to several longtime family acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
But what effect, if any, the earlier tragedy may have had on his decision 
Thursday morning to shoot his wife, then kill two co-workers and wound a third 
is uncertain. Two of Taylor's brothers and a sister declined to discuss the 
incident Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his relatives and co-workers here suggested in stronger terms Friday 
that the man who was described as a "model employee" was growing disillusioned 
with his work, and that stress, rather than personal problems, might be to 
blame for the Thursday morning bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
But Escondido Police Lt. Danny Starr said investigators may remain forever 
baffled by Taylor's motive and may have to write it off as "a tragedy that 
can't be explained." 
</P>
<P>
Starr said Taylor, 52, may have believed that he was under investigation by 
postal authorities for mail theft -- even though there was no such inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"One of his co-workers told one of our investigators that Taylor thought they 
were trying to fire him for mail theft, but we checked with the Post Office, 
and they said there absolutely was no such investigation," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Starr said investigators continued Friday to talk to relatives and co-workers, 
and that, although all have offered speculation, there are no new leads. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting little bits and pieces of what people think might have been the 
problem, but nothing has hit us in the face that would explain why he went off 
the deep end," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the person who could tell us is Taylor. . . . His close friends 
or his wife might have been privy to something, but he took them with him. 
That's made it tough for us." 
</P>
<P>
Attention also focused on Taylor's alleged violent behavior against his former 
wife, Mary, who divorced Taylor in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed in Vista Superior Court quoted Mary Taylor as saying she wanted 
to end her marriage because her husband was "extraordinarily violent, 
frequently drinks to excess, has threatened (her) life on many occasions and . 
. . physically struck, battered and beat (her) to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
But Ramon D. Asedo, the attorney who represented John Taylor in the divorce, 
disputed the allegations of drinking and beating. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no showing of physical violence," Asedo said Friday. "It was an 
extremely quiet, placid and pleasant separation. There was no real drinking or 
abuse, and that petition is just the kind of typical garbage we lawyers put in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's father, a farmer and heavy-machine operator, was a heavy drinker and 
wife abuser, according to several family acquaintances who live near the Taylor 
hometown of Mokane, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the Taylor boys all my life. It's a big family," said James St. 
George Tucker, past president of the Kingdom of Callaway Historical Society, 
which serves Mokane. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter, whose name was not known Friday, was exonerated in the shooting, 
Tucker said, mainly because Joseph Taylor had a "long history of abuse and 
drinking, of hitting his wife mainly, but the kids too." 
</P>
<P>
Mokane Mayor Howard (Glen) Paul, who grew up down the block from the Taylors, 
said the shooting "had an effect here, and everybody here remembers it." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether John Taylor was at home the night his 
father was killed, and two brothers and a sister still living in the Mokane 
area declined to talk about their brother or the shooting. But other sources in 
Mokane recalled that, soon after his father's death, young John Taylor 
graduated from high school and joined the Marine Corps in 1955. He later 
settled in the San Diego area, the only member of his family to leave Missouri, 
and joined the Postal Service in March, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, his previous wife, Mary Taylor, and her five children by that 
marriage, declined comment. "We ask for your understanding, patience and 
empathy at this very difficult time for our family," the family said in a 
prepared statement that was read at Palomar Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's shooting rampage began five blocks from Mary Taylor's home, where 
her former husband shot his wife, Liesbeth, twice in the head as she lay in 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
One of John Taylor's three stepchildren said Friday that the postal carrier had 
been complaining increasingly about the aches and pains from his job. 
</P>
<P>
"He was complaining about his back, his heels, his shoulder hurting," said Mike 
McMullen, 22. 
</P>
<P>
After killing his wife, Taylor, dressed in his postal uniform, then drove to 
the Orange Glen postal station about half a mile away, where he shot and killed 
two co-workers with whom he would share a cup of coffee and a smoke most 
mornings before work at a loading-dock picnic table. Taylor then went inside 
and wounded a third employee before shooting himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Ron Williams, 56, of Escondido, and Richard Berni, 38, of San 
Marcos. Paul DeRisi was shot in the arm, and a fourth co-worker was injured 
when she fell while fleeing the building, in the 1700 block of East Valley 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen discounted suggestions by neighbors that his mother and stepfather 
were experiencing marital difficulties. "They were very happy," said McMullen, 
who lives nearby in Escondido. "They were going to be leaving soon for a 
vacation back to Missouri to visit his (Taylor's) mom." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Dunne, vice president of the postal union local in Escondido, dismissed 
contentions that the shooting could be attributed solely to any personal 
problems Taylor was having. Dunne also countered arguments by postal officials 
that a recent series of suicides and shootings by postal employees are not the 
result of high stress on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I really take exception to that," he said. "It may be true that something in 
their personal life triggers it. But the very fact that they go to the post 
office to do these terrible, tragic acts, where they take out other postal 
employees or a supervisor, or take their own lives, makes a very powerful 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said Friday that he had asked the House Post 
Office and Civil Service Committee to open an inquiry into the recent series of 
shootings and suicides and their relationship to work stress.

BRADLEY SUPPORTERS VOTE TO DISBAND COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A political fund-raising committee set up by supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley 
voted unanimously Friday to disband and return nearly $300,000 in donations 
gathered since last fall, its leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent attorney Richard J. Riordan said seven senior members of the 
Committee for the Future of Los Angeles, which he has headed since late spring, 
voted unanimously to return the money rather than disburse it to charity. Those 
were the only two options considered, Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said committee members did not discuss using the money to defray 
mounting legal bills for the mayor, who on Saturday summoned almost three dozen 
longtime contributors to his Hancock Park home and asked for their help in 
paying for his battery of lawyers. A Bradley confidante has said the mayor's 
legal fees are running roughly $100,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan also said that neither the mayor nor his allies had asked that the 
money be offered to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The disbanding of the fund-raising committee was "absolutely not" meant as a 
signal of eroding support for the beleaguered mayor, Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
As investigations into Bradley's financial conduct have escalated, his 
politically powerful supporters have indicated growing concern over the future 
of his mayoralty, with some openly stating that the controversy has limited 
Bradley's effectiveness in dealing with the city's pressing urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's dissolution was planned for some time, Riordan said, and was 
not connected to the release Friday of Bradley's amended financial disclosure 
statements, which had been sought by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission in the wake of investigations into Bradley's fiscal dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was organized last year, was led by several Bradley 
allies, including Fran Savitch, formerly a chief mayoral aide; William 
Robertson, organized labor's local leader; attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and 
former Harbor Commission President Ira Distenfield.

STUDY SUGGESTS SELF-PROTECTION AGAINST AIDS

A USC study suggests the responsibility of "safe sex" rests with the individual 
and that one cannot count on a sexual partner for protection against infection 
with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The federally funded study, presented Friday at the annual meeting of the 
American Psychological Assn., found that of 90 men and women known to be 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, half had continued to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
Of those, 17 men, or 19% of the total group, continued to have sex without 
informing one or more of their partners that they were infected. By contrast, 
all of the women who continued to have sex informed their partners, according 
to their responses in confidential questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings support the idea that individuals must assume responsibility for 
protecting themselves from HIV infection," said Gary Marks, an assistant 
professor of preventive medicine at the USC School of Medicine and an author of 
the study. "Others cannot be depended upon to behave in a socially protective 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers did not analyze the specific sexual practices of the 76 men and 
14 women in the study. But generally, they said, sex occurred both with and 
without condoms and included activities such as anal intercourse, considered 
especially risky in terms of spreading the virus. 
</P>
<P>
The other findings included the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Those who withheld the fact of their infection were on average slightly 
younger and less educated than their more forthcoming counterparts. They tended 
to have fewer physical symptoms and to have been diagnosed for a longer period 
of time, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
* Men and women were more likely to reveal their diagnosis to others if those 
people knew of the infected person's sexual preference. Less than 10% of the 
gay and bisexual men in the study disclosed their diagnosis to friends, parents 
or employers unaware of their orientation. 
</P>
<P>
* Whether a person revealed their diagnosis depended on how serious they 
considered the consequences of the revelation to be. However, the actual 
consequences of disclosing the information were often less serious than the 
infected person believed.

The second test flight of the controversial B-2 Stealth bomber could take place 
as early as today at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the Air Force 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The exact date of the flight will not be pre-announced, but is presently 
scheduled to take place within a five-day time frame beginning Saturday," the 
Air Force said. 
</P>
<P>
The radar-evading bomber -- at $530 million a copy the most expensive warplane 
ever built -- successfully completed its maiden flight July 17. 
</P>
<P>
The bat-like aircraft took off from the Northrop Corp.'s assembly plant in 
Palmdale, Calif., and soared across the Mojave Desert at 10,000 feet for two 
hours before landing at Edwards, 25 miles from Palmdale.

STUDY URGES USE OF SHORT-TERM THERAPIES FOR WOMEN'S DEPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
New forms of psychotherapy lasting as little as 12 to 16 weeks are proving 
increasingly effective in treating depressed women, according to a massive 
study of women and depression that suggests that long-term therapy and years of 
medication may not be necessary for many of the millions of American women who 
suffer from the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year study, preliminary results of which were presented Friday at the 
annual meeting of the American Psychological Assn., confirmed previous findings 
that women are twice as likely as men to experience diagnosable depression and 
are three to five times as likely as men to attempt suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are especially vulnerable to depression, but new treatment technologies 
report a success rate of 80% to 90% in providing at least initial, and 
sometimes long-term, relief," said Ellen McGrath, chairman of the association's 
task force on women and depression, which intends to release its findings in 
full this fall. 
</P>
<P>
According to McGrath, the task force found in reviewing recent research that 
several forms of short-term therapy are well suited for treating women's 
depression. On their own or in combination with each other or with 
anti-depressant medication, the therapies offer at least temporary relief 
within three to four months, the group contends. 
</P>
<P>
One of those therapies, so-called interpersonal therapy, focuses narrowly on 
current "interpersonal problems" such as grief or a dispute over a woman's role 
in marriage. The emphasis on relationships makes the therapy especially 
appropriate for women, who derive much of their identity and sense of 
well-being from relationships, members of the task force said. 
</P>
<P>
The group also called for wider use of cognitive therapy, which aims to correct 
distorted thinking such as negative and pessimistic views of oneself and the 
world; and behavioral treatments for depression, which aim to teach social 
skills, problem-solving, assertiveness and other skills. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Post, a clinical psychologist at the University of Colorado Health 
Sciences Center and a member of the task force, said studies indicate that 
those therapies have proven effective in as little as 8 to 16 weeks. However, 
she said depression is often cyclical; about 20% to 45% of women who are helped 
will experience a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Post and others on the task force urged therapists to set up peer support 
groups and "refresher courses" for graduates of short-term therapy. They said 
it is important for women to understand that they can get relief from 
depression without embarking upon a decade of psychotherapy and years on 
anti-depressant drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, made up of nearly two dozen therapists in research and private 
practice, began the study in response to accumulating evidence that depression 
is increasing, particularly among women. Reviewing published and unpublished 
data from studies on depression that included thousands of women, they 
concluded that one in four women will suffer so-called major depression -- 
which goes beyond simple reaction to a specific life stress -- in her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The group attributed the disproportionately high rate of depression among women 
to a mix of social, biological and emotional factors. Those range from an 
unequal burden of poverty that falls on women, to hormonal changes, to what 
McGrath described as women's tendency to focus on depressed feelings "at the 
expense of action and mastery strategies." 
</P>
<P>
The group also made the following findings: 
</P>
<P>
* The rate of sexual and physical abuse of girls and women appears to be higher 
than previously thought. One study found that 37% of adult women had 
experienced some form of physical or sexual abuse by the time they reached age 
21, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
* Married women are more likely to be depressed than single or divorced women 
or widows, the group found. A woman in an unhappy marriage is three times more 
likely than her husband to feel seriously depressed. 
</P>
<P>
* Depression in women is misdiagnosed 30% to 50% of the time, sometimes as a 
physical problem such as untreatable dementia. Nevertheless, women are 
frequently prescribed powerful medication: 70% of all prescriptions for 
anti-depressants go to women. 
</P>
<P>
The task force called for therapists and counselors to learn, through 
continuing or graduate education, more about the evolving short-term therapies. 
The group said a mix of interpersonal therapy and cognitive and behavioral 
approaches appears to be "one of the optimal treatments . . . for mild to 
moderately depressed women." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-depressants "are effective and even necessary in treating certain kinds of 
depressions for women," the group reported. But they cautioned that the drugs 
work differently for men and women and in some cases have not been tested 
adequately in women before marketing.

WHITMAN TO BUY VAN DE KAMP'S SEAFOODS DIVISION FOR $140 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co. has agreed to sell its San Diego-based Van de 
Kamp's frozen seafoods division to Whitman Corp. for about $140 million in 
cash, the company said Friday. Pillsbury hopes to complete the transaction by 
mid-September, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Pillsbury, which was acquired by London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC early this 
year, in May announced its intention to sell both Van de Kamp's and Bumble Bee 
Seafoods, another San Diego-based seafood operation. 
</P>
<P>
Whitman officials were uncertain Friday if the proposed sale would affect 40 
employees and managers in San Diego. Van de Kamp's also has 300 employees at a 
processing plant in Erie, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much too premature to speculate what might happen" in San Diego, 
according to Wendell Larsen, senior vice president of corporate affairs at 
Chicago-based Whitman. "But, generally speaking, we're not planning to strip 
the company. We're planning to expand the business and make it more 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Whitman, which owns several consumer goods and services companies, reported $4 
billion in sales during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's, which markets frozen seafood products in the United States, 
recently reported annual sales of more than $100 million. Its products are sold 
under the Van de Kamp's and Today's Catch brand names. 
</P>
<P>
"Van de Kamp's is a superior company that has strong potential," said Ian A. 
Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Pillsbury, which reported $6.2 
billion in 1988 revenue. "The Van de Kamp's line, however, does not fit 
Pillsbury's core businesses and long-range strategy," Martin said.

EARNINGS: TWA REPORTS A $4.4-MILLION LOSS IN ITS SECOND QUARTER

Trans World Airlines Inc. reported Friday a net loss of $4.4 million for the 
second quarter, which it attributed partly to expenses stemming from last 
year's privatization of the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
TWA, owned by takeover specialist Carl C. Icahn, said its second-quarter loss 
contrasted with a net profit of $97.2 million in the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The year-earlier results include a one-time gain from litigation between TWA 
and the estate of the late Howard Hughes, a previous owner. The results for the 
latest quarter do not include about $87 million in unrealized gains from TWA's 
investment portfolio, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest loss occurred despite a 5.7% increase in second-quarter revenue to 
$1.20 billion from $1.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, TWA suspended contract talks with the machinists union because 
of the possibility of a merger or change in management at the airline, union 
officials said.

PRESIDENT OF L.A. CONVENTION BUREAU FORCED OUT BY BOARD

The top staff member of the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau has 
been forced out by the board of the nonprofit booster organization, it was 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The contract of Bill F. Miller, the 46-year-old president of the bureau, has 
not been renewed, said Lloyd Axelrod, vice president of public relations for 
the bureau. Miller joined the bureau in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod said the board's executive committee did not reveal the reasons for its 
decision, which was made Thursday. Miller, whose contract expired June 30, was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Day-to-day operations will be handled by Philip H. Westernoff, vice president 
of marketing. A committee is being formed to conduct a nationwide search to 
replace Miller, who was brought in to reorganize the bureau and help increase 
the area's tourism and convention business. 
</P>
<P>
Two other top officials resigned this week for "personal reasons," Axelrod 
said. They are Roger Gilmore, senior vice president of travel industry sales, 
and Frank Santos, director of convention marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau's name was recently changed from the Greater Los Angeles Visitors 
&amp; Convention Bureau. The organization receives about two-thirds of its 
funds from the City of Los Angeles.

FREEDOM OF CHOICE ISN'T TOTAL; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION STANCE YIELDS TO NEUTRAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP A. LACOVARA, Philip A. Lacovara served as deputy solicitor general of 
the United States as as counsel to the Watergate special prosecutor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No national debate since the clash over slavery has generated as much emotion 
as the struggle over abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Supreme Court's decision in the Missouri abortion case, Webster 
vs. Reproductive Health Services, and its promise (or threat) to hear several 
more abortion cases this fall, the clamor has reached a near frenzy. Reflecting 
the intense passions of the protagonists, the dialogue involves ear-splitting 
accusations that each side is invading fundamental rights. 
</P>
<P>
In place of reasoned analysis, however, each camp wraps itself in a slogan 
that, standing alone, everyone would embrace. Yet somehow everyone must choose 
between being "pro-choice" or "pro-life." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that each warring faction seems more intent on declaring 
its self-righteous position to be self-evidently correct than on testing it 
according to any set of principles and values that apply outside the abortion 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
Tested by "neutral principles" that would otherwise command virtually unanimous 
support under the American legal system, it is the pro-choice position that 
crumbles -- at least to the extent that pro-choice forces insist that society 
has no right to enact restrictions on the opportunity to elect abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom of choice is not itself a principle that either public law or private 
morality treats as an absolute. Rather, the true principle is a bit more 
complicated. We have the right only to choose between alternatives that are 
legally and morally permissible. Thus, to focus exclusively on the "right to 
choose" begs the question whether society may properly limit the options. 
</P>
<P>
This principle applies with full force even in matters as intimate and personal 
as family status and child-rearing, the setting for the abortion issue. A woman 
may choose to marry or not, but she is not permitted to choose to marry a man 
who already has a wife. Similarly, if the man has tired of his marriage, he may 
choose to divorce his wife, but society may properly deny him the right to 
choose to free himself by murdering her. 
</P>
<P>
Similar values constrain the definitions affecting child-rearing. The 
pro-choice position involves the general proposition with which few people 
could disagree -- that a woman has the fundamental right to decide whether to 
have a child. Once again, however, it becomes necessary to acknowledge that 
other values may appropriately control the timing of that choice and the method 
of exercising it. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the U.S. solicitor general was urging the Supreme Court to abandon 
its recognition of a fundamental constitutional right to obtain an abortion, he 
agreed that the court should not retreat from the earlier ruling on which the 
Roe vs. Wade abortion decision rested. In that earlier case, the court had 
decided that the constitutional interest in protecting the privacy of the 
marital bedroom made it intolerable for the government to forbid the use of 
birth control techniques and thus to prevent conception. That aspect of the 
right to choose not to conceive a child is not seriously under attack. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion debate simply frames the question: What other mechanisms are open 
to implement a woman's decision not to raise a child? Putting aside for a 
moment the period of pregnancy, it is well established in our society that a 
woman may properly deal with an unplanned -- or rethought -- pregnancy at least 
by offering the child for adoption, but not by deliberate infanticide or even 
casual abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
The right to choose to have a child is no less precious than the right not to, 
but this right is equally subject to restriction. Even an earnest but childless 
couple may not offer their infertility to justify kidnaping. Thus, it does not 
really advance the inquiry very far to label the issue a matter of choice, 
since these obvious examples illustrate that the right to choose is not 
absolute. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice proponents suggest that constraints of these types have no 
legitimate relevance. They assert that abortion is fundamentally different 
because the decision whether to allow a fetus, once conceived, to come to term 
involves no clash or interests or competing personal rights. It is said to be 
merely a matter of a woman's "right to control her own body." 
</P>
<P>
Yet virtually everyone agrees that once the interests of another "person" 
enters the picture, the abortion equation shifts dramatically. This prompts the 
elusive quest to decide when "human life" begins. Unfortunately, the answer to 
that inquiry involves so many medical, philosophical and moral assumptions that 
it may not provide much useful guidance for determining when society may 
properly restrict abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice position emphasizes that at the early stages of pregnancy, the 
fetus has little or no capacity for thought, as measured by brain-wave 
activity. That fact is irrelevant to the pro-life groups, who rely on their 
adamant but unprovable insistence that a fetus is "human life" from the moment 
of conception, because that is when God infuses the fertilized ovum with a 
human soul. Based on observable physical characteristics, the pro-choice 
advocates conclude that during those early stages there is no other human life 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Is this sincerely held doubt that a fetus represents human life a legitimate 
basis for the assertion of an absolute right to obtain an abortion? The law 
generally goes to extremes to avoid even a serious risk of danger to a person, 
even where there is some doubt about whether a human being is in danger. Thus, 
if a hunter hears something rustling in the brush, we expect him to hold his 
fire if there is a real chance that it is a toddler (or another hunter) on the 
other side of the woods, not a deer. 
</P>
<P>
The neutral principle involved is that reasonable doubts are to be resolved in 
favor of protecting what may be a human being. Although regard for this 
principle may not oblige society to outlaw abortion at any stage of pregnancy 
-- and on that issue the absolutist pro-life position also goes too far -- it 
is certainly consistent with traditional legal principles for the legislature 
to decide to give the "benefit of the doubt" to the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Other generally recognized principles apply even more clearly to some of the 
other disputes that are swirling around courts and legislatures. One highly 
charged dilemma involves the clash between the woman's claim to assert complete 
control over her body and the biological father's interest in the fate of the 
fetus. Pro-choice proponents challenge laws that would give the father a veto 
over the proposed abortion or at least require notice and an opportunity to 
dissuade the woman from choosing to abort the fetus. Those restrictions are 
viewed as improperly interfering with the woman's dominion over her person. 
</P>
<P>
* 
</P>
<P>
Even without focusing on whether the fetus has protectable interests of its 
own, that argument conflicts with other traditionally accepted principles. At 
the very least, creation of the fetus involves what the law -- and biology -- 
would treat as a joint venture. Especially in a marriage, the very creation of 
the fetus is the result of what is aptly regarded as a partnership. It is 
fatuous to assert that the biological father has no interest in the decision 
whether to abort the fetus. Although the fetus is growing in the woman's womb, 
the father has contributed half of its genetic material. If the abortion does 
not occur (and no other misadventure intervenes), the fetus will be the 
father's child. 
</P>
<P>
In any joint venture or partnership, the parties have obligations to one 
another, including the duty to exercise reasonable care in safeguarding the 
fruits of the partnership. Of course, with the rights of partnership come 
obligations. If the woman brings the fetus to full term, the father has not 
only the moral obligation but also the legal duty to nurture and support the 
child. While it is true that in some instances the natural father may default 
in performing those obligations, those lapses by some hardly support the 
conclusion that no biological father is entitled to participate in the abortion 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Even clearer is the legitimacy of laws requiring parental notification and 
consent before a minor may have an abortion. Even on the premises invoked by 
pro-choice advocates, it is difficult to see why a minor must be 
constitutionally immune from this kind of parental supervision -- even though, 
by definition, it is coming rather late. Assume that abortion involves nothing 
more than an ordinary medical procedure to remove unwanted tissue from the 
young woman's body and that there is otherwise a "right" to undergo such a 
procedure. Tested by those premises, though, the right to an abortion cannot be 
meaningfully distinguished from the right to have a "nose job" or breast 
reduction (or enlargement) surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps those surgical procedures would be in the minor's best interests, 
perhaps they would not. But few people regard it as an unconscionable, much 
less unconstitutional, infringement on the young woman's capacity to elect 
surgery if the law tells both the girl and her doctor that they may only 
proceed if her parents approve. That is the neutral principle that validates 
the requirement of parental notice and consent in the abortion setting. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other volatile issue on which neutral principles, honestly 
applied, undercut the pro-choice advocates' furious response to the Supreme 
Court's Webster decision. In that case the court decided that the government 
has no constitutional obligation to make public money available for abortions. 
The attack on that decision brands it as callously frustrating the fundamental 
right to an abortion, especially the right of poor women to choose this course. 
</P>
<P>
The legs of this argument are too wobbly to support it. From the pro-choice 
perspective, abortion is a fundamental right that flows from a woman's right to 
control her own body. That right, so the argument runs, includes the right to 
choose elective surgery when the woman concludes, in consultation with her 
doctor, that she would be well off to take that step. If the decision is that 
prosaic, though, it is difficult to understand why the "right" stands on any 
different footing from the right to have otherwise desirable elective surgery 
-- a tummy tuck or a tightening of the skin around the eyelids or neck. 
</P>
<P>
Comparison with these other types of elective surgery is not intended to be 
flip or patronizing. Rather, it shows that according to relatively clear, 
neutral principles the conclusion that a person has a "right" to choose to have 
elective surgery does not mean that the government is trampling on that right 
when the legislature decides not to subsidize its exercise. Thus, the Supreme 
Court has firmly settled that there is a constitutional right to engage in 
interstate and foreign travel, and the government may not affirmatively 
interfere with its exercise. But no one seriously contends that respect for 
this principle requires taxpayers to fund trips to Disneyland or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
This comparison with otherwise applicable and accepted principles of public 
policy makes it unnecessary to resolve the sincerely held but inherently 
unprovable antitheses on such value-laden questions as when "human life" 
begins. Whether resting on religious beliefs or secular presuppositions, that 
debate involves articles of faith. History has shown that the law is too blunt 
an instrument to change personal tenets, and it should rarely even try to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
If this highly personalized issue is cast loose from these principles and 
addressed in myopic isolation, the pro-choice battle cry appears compelling. 
Yet when measured by conventional principles, neutrally applied, virtually all 
forms of abortion regulation have ample justification in American 
constitutional law.

FOR JURORS, ORDEAL GOES BEYOND THE COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first weeks were the most hellish. The physical mutilations of young men, 
the castrations and tortures, the sexual perversions -- all were introduced in 
the Santa Ana courtroom in pictures and testimony more brutally graphic than 
the 12 jurors and seven alternates could have ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Those first few days and weeks, juror Alfred Embrey Jr. used to wake up in a 
cold sweat in his Orange home, the nightmares of violent crimes still fresh in 
his mind. An easygoing, 56-year-old electrician, he found himself strangely 
irritable with his wife. And later came the chest pains as he pondered whether 
Randy Steven Kraft of Long Beach should die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're not used to having to see things as brutal as this, it can be just 
too much to deal with," Embrey said. "You have to block it out, put it aside; 
otherwise, it's just too hard to accept that a human being could do this." 
</P>
<P>
A year after they were chosen, partly through luck of the draw, to judge a man 
reputed to be perhaps the most prolific serial killer in the nation's history, 
the jurors' official role in the Kraft case ended Friday in dramatic fashion 
with a death verdict that took just a single vote to reach. 
</P>
<P>
But the effects of their ordeal extend far beyond the confines of the courtroom 
and promise to linger, for better or worse, for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can't put this to rest," said Jim E. Lytle, 29, of Garden Grove, who 
was the foreman of the jury for the two-month penalty phase of the trial. "It's 
taken so much out of me." 
</P>
<P>
For some on the jury, the Kraft trial was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that, 
they say, has reshaped their lives positively by persuaded them to seek new 
careers in criminal justice or to pursue judicial reforms to speed the court 
process and strengthen the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
And Pat Marcantel, 37, of Fullerton added at the close of her year spent at the 
Orange County courthouse: "The food was great." 
</P>
<P>
But for many jurors, the memories were anything but sweet. 
</P>
<P>
* A Brea schoolteacher came across the word "ligature" -- something used for 
tying -- in a lesson book and had to stop class momentarily because she was so 
shaken by the recurring images of Kraft choking young Marines with their own 
shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I couldn't catch my breath when I saw this word," said teacher 
Charleen A. Vershaw of Brea. "I could never explain it to the children or to 
anybody else. Who would understand?" 
</P>
<P>
* An Anaheim woman found an old green garbage bag in her garage and started 
crying uncontrollably. Inside was an old car transmission, but to the juror, 
the bag conjured up images of the one in which Randy Kraft had stuffed one of 
his victims. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and daughter asked me, 'What's wrong?' " said Debora Garcia, 31. 
"They don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
And a Placentia housewife found that such household items as swizzle sticks, 
toothbrushes and shoelaces have now taken on a horrific meaning since the trial 
as Randy Kraft's instruments of death and torture. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never be the same," said Theodora J. Replogle, 59, of Placentia. 
"Normal things don't even seem to be the same anymore. . . . They were used so 
horribly by him." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing those thoughts, juror Carol M. Neal, 33, of Tustin said: "My husband 
came to court a few times so that he could see what I was going through. I just 
don't think I'll ever be the same again. I know I won't be as trusting. I'll 
know that someone who can seem very ordinary in everyday life can be capable of 
doing terrible things. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be alone. One night after we had viewed those awful 
pictures of (one of the victims), my husband was supposed to go bowling. But I 
asked him could he please stay home with me that night. I had to get my mind 
off it." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, packed side by side in the Santa Ana courtroom of Superior Court 
Judge Donald A. McCartin, forbidden to discuss the case with anyone and 
sequestered for two weeks in a hotel in May to deliberate Kraft's guilt or 
innocence, said they developed a close and unique bond. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody now knows everybody else's life," alternate juror Velma McClinton 
said. "Every year we're going to have a reunion. It was like one big family." 
</P>
<P>
"We got to know each other better than we knew our own spouses," Neal added. 
</P>
<P>
When it was all over early Friday afternoon, when the verdict was read and the 
media people had asked all their questions and taken all their pictures, many 
of the jurors exchanged hugs and promised to keep in touch. 
</P>
<P>
A few cried. Some went out together to get something to eat -- a "relief lunch" 
at the end of a long ordeal, one called it. 
</P>
<P>
They all seemed satisfied with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Each had said, when the jury was being selected, that under the right 
circumstances they could sentence a defendant to death. But the actual delivery 
of such an extreme sentence, several said, was a far tougher matter. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you have to give a great deal of thought, a great deal of 
soul searching," said Corrine A. Goldfarb, 49, of Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors took more than two days to reach a verdict of death, but they said 
most of that time was used to review the details of Kraft's crimes: the 16 
murders for which they convicted him in May and the eight additional killings 
that prosecutors introduced in the penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Once that review was completed and the choice between death or a life without 
parole sentence was before them on Friday morning, the vote was quick and 
unanimous, jurors said. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said they were generally unswayed by testimony from friends and 
family of Kraft, who portrayed him sympathetically. Kraft, the jurors believed, 
was a manipulative and deceitful person who was able to fool those close to him 
and hide behind a mask of respectability. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors also said that despite attempts by the defense team to cast doubt on 
the character of the young men Kraft killed, they felt a real sympathy for the 
victims and their families, several of whom attended the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I knew the victims," said juror Tracie Metzner, 26, of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't go in there with 'an eye for an eye' mentality," Embrey 
said, "but when we looked at the whole of the evidence, there was really only 
one possible conclusion: death." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said the frequency of Kraft's killings, the savagery of the crimes and 
the defendant's apparent lack of remorse all contributed to their decision to 
send him to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"The death phase was shocking to me," Marcantel said. "Every time a new victim 
came up, he did something more horrible to them. I can't imagine how somebody 
could do that to another person." 
</P>
<P>
As confident as the jurors said they were in their decision, many said that 
even after hundreds of witnesses and thousands of hours of testimony, they were 
still left with a nagging question. It was a question several said they wish 
they could put to Kraft himself: Why? 
</P>
<P>
"How could someone look so normal and successful and then commit crimes as 
barbaric and inhumane as these?" Embrey asked. "I'm not sure we'll ever know 
the answer."

GETTING WORLD SERIOUS AT THE BIG A: ANGELS' FANS PACK THE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the annual milking contest and there were cows behind home plate, but 
that wasn't what brought more than 60,000 cheering fans to Anaheim Stadium on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
What brought them was baseball. It was the surprisingly successful California 
Angels versus the dreaded defending American League champion Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
It was the prelude to a critical three-game series, as they say in baseball, 
between two teams deadlocked in a virtual tie for first place. 
</P>
<P>
It was a match-up of two teams with the best records in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It was also an Anaheim record attendance with 152,000 advance tickets sold for 
the weekend series, eclipsing the old record of 146,010 set in 1982 against the 
Kansas City Royals. The game Friday night drew 61,696 fans, the 21st time the 
Angels have drawn more than 60,000 people to a game. 
</P>
<P>
It was Angels' pennant fever. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being at a championship playoff -- both teams are really strong 
right now," said a breathless Alfred Hernandez of Whittier, waiting for the 
game to begin. "It's real exciting. The top two teams in the majors. It should 
be a great game." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the last pitch is thrown Sunday afternoon, "we could have close to 
60,000 for each game easily," Angels spokesman Larry Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the first pitch was thrown Friday night, four young men from San 
Bernardino had their pennant fever reduced a few degrees, but only a few. A 
security officer asked the avid Angel fans to douse their barbecue that was set 
up behind their car in the Anaheim Stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best," said an undaunted Tim Watt, 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll come here -- this same exact spot -- tomorrow," agreed his buddy, Bobby 
De La Torre, 20. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that De La Torre has the enviable use of his cousin's four season 
tickets right behind the first base dugout for today's game while on Friday 
they were using the season tickets of another friend's father. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Travel 
</P>
<P>
"They are my dad's season tickets," explained Pat Arias, 17, who with his 
friends were more than willing to travel from San Bernardino for the games. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, as Angels and Athletics fans filed into the stadium, Richard and 
Leslie Urie of Anaheim were spreading a blanket on a patch of grass under a 
tree and setting out their picnic supper. They were also introducing their 
2-year-old twins, Hannah and Sarah, and big brother Joshua, 4, to family 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their first baseball game," Richard said as he set out food for the 
toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our anniversary was yesterday," he said, noting that taking in a baseball game 
is a more than acceptable way to note such occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we did on our honeymoon," Leslie added in absolute agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But even such enthusiastic baseball fans as the Uries sometimes are not moved 
to act until it is nearly too late. They chanced being able to get tickets on 
the day of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky," Richard Urie said. "Actually we're right in the front row . . 
. of general admission. In center field, of course." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Let Friend Treat 
</P>

Ross and Jan Salvato of Huntington Beach have no trouble getting tickets, even 
good ones. They are ticket brokers who buy and sell the ducats for a living. 
But Friday they decided to let a friend treat them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," Ross Salvato said. "I think we finally got Orange County 
motivated enough to fill this stadium." 
</P>
<P>
"If this series were the Dodgers and the Giants in the same situation, it would 
have been sold out weeks ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But make no mistake about it, the Salvatos are fans of the Angels and the 
team's owner, singing cowboy Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice if they (the Angels) could do it for the cowboy," Jan Salvato 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most locals root for the home team, of course. It's no wonder then that Angels' 
memorabilia was outselling Athletics' shirts and caps at the concession stand, 
although stand salesclerk Joan Schott said the visiting team's doodads were 
moving quite well. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a little out of the ordinary for Mike Dal Porto to be rooting for 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from Alameda, you know -- near Oakland," explained the 14-year-old fan. 
"But I'm not really for Oakland. I like the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
"We always come down for these games," Mike said. "My dad's kind of rich. He 
owns an oil company." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Came Early 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone came from quite as far to see Friday night's game, although many 
of those who did came extra early to witness firsthand the last match-up of the 
year between the Angels and Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more people coming early" was the judgment of Bob Patterson, who as 
an usher on aisles 8 to 22 is expert in such matters. "It's going to be 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Bartender Bob Lamb, who serves drinks in the Anaheim Stadium California Saloon 
on the field level, noted that his patrons are talking up the team much more 
this season than they used to. 
</P>
<P>
"This year most of the discussion is very positive," he said. "In past years it 
was very negative, like: 'Gosh, I don't want to ever come again.' 
</P>
<P>
"And this is the game of the year," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they lose," said Chris Lappi of Santa Ana, who was at the game with 
his wife, "it's nice to see them in contention. For a while." 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim has a problem with teams choking at the end. I'd like to see them do 
it, but it doesn't seem likely." 
</P>
<P>
Many fans recall close Angel encounters with championships, such as the last 
brush with success when the team lost a wrenching championship playoff series 
to the Boston Red Sox in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure it (the pennant race) will go down to the wire," self-described 
Angels die-hard fan Howard Skinner of Westminster predicted. "Oakland's tough." 
</P>
<P>
But as long as the race is hot and the Angels are in it, they won't need star 
first baseman Wally Joyner grabbing a cow's udder in a milking contest or other 
promotional gimmicks to continue to lure the fans out to the old ballpark at a 
pace that exceeds last year's attendance. 
</P>
<P>
As 14-year-old Mike Dal Porto put it: "It's a big deal."

KRAFT CONDEMNED TO DEATH BY JURY FOR SERIAL KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Steven Kraft, a 44-year-old computer expert portrayed by prosecutors as 
perhaps the most prolific serial killer in the country, was condemned to death 
by a jury Friday for the gruesome sex murders of 16 young men in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft sat with his hands folded, tapping his thumbs together as he heard the 
death verdict, but showed no emotion. He whispered to one of his attorneys to 
have the 10 women and two men on the jury polled individually about their 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"He should die for what he did to all these people," said juror Carol Neal, 33, 
of Tustin, outside the courtroom later. "I've had nightmares thinking about the 
horror of what this man has done." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Debora Garcia, 31, of Anaheim said: "I'm never going to be normal again. 
I was naive about so many things." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, who had listened to the sometimes-grisly testimony since last 
September in the Santa Ana courtroom, said afterward that the choice between 
death and life in prison without parole -- their only other option -- was not 
close. After two days of deliberation, they took their first ballot Friday 
morning, and it was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the jurors hugged Shirley DeVaul and Judy Nelson, the mothers of two 
young Buena Park men whom Kraft killed together six years ago. DeVaul wore a 
tiny medallion on her blouse with a photo of her son. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice has finally been done," she said later. "It won't bring back my son. 
But it's a guarantee that Kraft won't hurt anyone anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson thanked the jurors and said later, "They could see my pain." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin set a tentative sentencing date of Oct. 
27. But Kraft's lawyers told him they did not think they could be ready for a 
sentencing hearing by then. 
</P>
<P>
On May 12, the jury convicted Kraft of all 16 murders presented to them. But 
during the penalty phase, prosecutors introduced eight more murders from Oregon 
and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have linked Kraft to 45 murders altogether. But they say the 
numbers could be much greater, based on a list found in Kraft's briefcase with 
61 entries, which prosecutors have called his own "score card" of victims. The 
jurors saw fewer than half of the notations on the list but said afterward they 
had no doubt it was a death list. 
</P>
<P>
Some jurors said they could find no reason to return a verdict less than death. 
Others said they felt some sympathy for Kraft's many sisters, nieces and 
in-laws who testified about his character at the two-month penalty hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I know him better than his family does," said juror Pat Marcantel, 
37, of Fullerton. "I think his family needs to wake up. He was a manipulator." 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said Kraft's cool demeanor throughout the trial bothered them. 
</P>
<P>
Marcantel said that when Kraft looked at her as the verdict was read, "It made 
me nervous. . . . I felt a pain in my stomach. This time, I just looked right 
back at him." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Garcia said she was convinced when the trial began that Kraft was 
innocent, because "he didn't seem like he could do this. Then when I looked 
over the evidence myself, I went through everything with a magnifying glass. . 
. . Then I knew he was guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown told jurors in closing arguments that Kraft's 
arrest was "an end of an era, of Mr. Kraft flying freeways, murdering and 
dehumanizing people." That rampage began in 1971 and ended with his arrest in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials believe Kraft would pick up hitchhikers, ply them 
with alcohol and drugs, and then overpower them when they were too weak to 
resist. He would use their own shoelaces to bind their wrists, and then 
strangle many of them with their own belts. He would then dump their bodies 
along freeway ramps or in remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite dumping ground was the maze of freeway connections at the juncture 
of the San Diego and San Gabriel River freeways in the northwest corner of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The defense tried to show that evidence was not strong enough in some of the 
murders. In others, they tried to point to other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
But juror Neal said very little that the defense did made any impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept waiting, thinking, today is the day the defense is really going to come 
up with something. But it never happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald sat nervously outside the courtroom with the 
news media and the victims' families for 30 minutes waiting for the doors to 
open for the 12:30 p.m. verdict. Because the jury had deliberated only two 
days, he said, "It doesn't look very hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's family members, who had been surrounded by scores of news media people 
when the jury found Kraft guilty, did not appear in McCartin's courtroom 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The death verdict came almost 11 months after testimony began, making it the 
longest criminal trial in the history of Orange County Superior Court. Many 
legal experts believe it may also be one of the most expensive criminal cases 
California has ever seen. A judge, however, has sealed records of the costs 
from the public until all of Kraft's appeals are exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, Judge McCartin has the authority to set aside the jury's 
verdict and sentence Kraft to life without parole. But no Orange County judge 
has ever done that under the current capital-punishment law, and none of the 
principals involved expect McCartin to break that pattern. McCartin has already 
sentenced six men to death. All of them are at San Quentin State Prison 
awaiting the results of their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and judges involved in Kraft's case say it could be more than a decade 
before his appeals are exhausted and he is executed in the gas chamber at San 
Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft never testified at his trial. But he wrote to friends from the Orange 
County Jail that he was innocent. He told The Times in a November, 1983, 
interview: "I don't belong here." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was arrested at 1 a.m. on May 14, 1983, when two California Highway 
Patrol officers stopped him for weaving across a lane on the northbound 
Interstate 5 in Mission Viejo. They found a dead 25-year-old Marine in the 
front passenger seat of his car. Kraft said the man was a hitchhiker but 
offered no explanation for his death. 
</P>
<P>
Within 24 hours, Orange County Sheriff's Department investigators had linked 
Kraft to more than a dozen murders, based on evidence found in Kraft's car and 
his home in Long Beach. That evidence included pictures of some of the victims 
after their deaths, and in clothes they had worn when last seen, personal 
belongings of some of the victims, and the list in the briefcase, which had 
coded items such as "New Year's Eve," "Marine Carson" and "2 in 1 Beach." 
</P>
<P>
"The pictures and the stuff at his house -- the defense never explained any of 
it," juror Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the killings, officials say, had to be sexual depravity. Many of 
the victims were emasculated or their bodies were mutilated with cigarette 
lighter burns or other objects. 
</P>
<P>
Because Kraft has never admitted to the killings, the only motive ever 
attributed to him came from a close friend. The friend told police that Kraft 
once told him he had heard that "the ultimate orgasm is in death." The 
authorities did not know if Kraft meant the death itself, or that sexual 
gratification was heightened at the moment of death. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever way, prosecutor Brown said he believed that it was the motive for the 
killings. Judge McCartin, however, refused to let jurors hear it, based on 
vehement defense objections. 
</P>
<P>
After Kraft's conviction, his lawyers put on more than 50 character witnesses 
at his death penalty hearing. They all described Kraft as caring, loving and 
extremely bright. One poignant anecdote came from Carol Barnett, an elderly 
computer programmer who proudly described herself as one of Kraft's proteges. 
It was Kraft, she said, who recognized she was being discriminated against 
within the company because of her age. Barnett said he went out of his way to 
help her learn about computers. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't shun me aside like some of the others," she told the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Brown suggested to jurors that Kraft was a man with a mask. He 
wore the mask at work and with family and friends. But on his nighttime 
excursions hunting for hitchhikers, Brown said, "we got to see what Randy Kraft 
was really all about." 
</P>
<P>
Before his trial began, Kraft's lawyers had argued for 16 separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply impossible for anyone to get a fair trial when a jury is told he 
has committed 16 murders," said Kraft attorney James G. Merwin. But Judge 
McCartin refused to split up the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we lost that, it was all over, even the penalty phase is probably a 
foregone conclusion," said Kraft attorney William J. Kopeny during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the jurors said the Kraft case has permanently affected their lives. 
The longer it went on, they said, the more shocking were the horrors they heard 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"I tossed and turned every night; every death seemed to replay itself," said 
Jim E. Lytle, 29, of Garden Grove, foreman for the penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Neal said she had always had doubts about the validity of the death 
penalty, but not now. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd see the most horrible photos of what happened to some of these victims, 
and I'd look at Kraft and think, 'Did you really do that?' " Neal said. "Then 
after I'd heard all the evidence, I'd look at him and think, 'You really did do 
these things. . . . You deserve to die.' "

HUD QUESTIONS COSTA MESA'S POLICY ON ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials said Friday that Costa Mesa's controversial policy of 
withholding city money from charitable groups that serve illegal aliens may 
violate anti-discrimination law and could result in the loss of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in future federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Reed, a spokesman for the Los Angeles office of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, said his agency has expressed concern to city 
officials and has requested more information about the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a problem with it," Reed said. "It has just been brought to our 
attention in the last two days, and we haven't seen anything in writing, but we 
have referred the matter to our legal department for review." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opinion on Effect 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the policy could conflict with federal guidelines that bar 
discrimination on the basis of national origin. 
</P>
<P>
"In our opinion that covers everyone, including illegal aliens," Reed said. "If 
the policy does indeed go against rules, it could affect the awarding of future 
(Community Development) Block Grant money." 
</P>
<P>
The city received $809,000 in HUD block grant money this year. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa's unprecedented decision this week to withhold funds from all 
charitable organizations that assist illegal aliens -- except those providing 
medical aid -- provoked protests and a storm of controversy. Many critics said 
the measure would be impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa City Manager Allan L. Roeder defended the policy but said that the 
city will cooperate with federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the policy being drafted, we checked with our local HUD 
representative to see if there would be a conflict and were advised that he 
didn't feel there would be," Roeder said. "Subsequently, HUD has opted to take 
a second look, and we support their doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Roeder also said that if the policy is found to violate federal law, groups 
that receive federal funds would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Provision 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the unique nature of the policy, it includes a provision that 
should state or federal regulations preclude its application, then it would not 
apply to those funding sources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Roeder said city officials do not intend to scuttle the entire measure. He 
said it would still apply to organizations that receive local taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
HUD annually awards Community Development Block Grants to cities and counties 
for neighborhood development projects and to improve facilities and services. 
Local officials decide which organizations will get a share, but HUD monitors 
the programs to make sure that they conform to anti-discrimination and other 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Among other requirements, the grants must benefit low- and moderate-income 
people or be used to address needs that present a threat to the health or 
welfare of a community. 
</P>
<P>
About $550,000 of the $809,000 in block grant money Costa Mesa received this 
year is scheduled to go to more than 60 charitable organizations. They include 
such diverse groups as the Boys and Girls Club, the YMCA, the Costa Mesa 
Literacy Center, the Harbor Area Adult Day Care Center and the Sunshine 
Community Preschool. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contracts to Be Sent Soon 
</P>
<P>
Contracts containing the new illegal-alien restriction are expected to be sent 
to the organizations within about 45 days, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Orange County Human Relations Commission charged Friday that 
the city policy could lead to discrimination against Latinos and adversely 
affect charitable organizations in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss ramifications of 
the policy. City officials, representatives of city-funded agencies, the 
Hispanic Development Council of the United Way and the Epsicopal Vicar of the 
Catholic Diocese will be at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to illustrate to (Costa Mesa Mayor) Peter Buffa some of the 
significant and negative impacts that were perhaps unintended by the council on 
agencies involved in charity work," said Commission Executive Director Rusty 
Kennedy. "Also, everyone is concerned about the potential for serious 
discrimination in the implementation of this." 
</P>
<P>
Buffa, who voted for the policy along with Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed 
Glasgow, said he has agreed to meet with Kennedy's group but that it is 
unlikely that he will change his position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Try It and See' 
</P>
<P>
"The response I have gotten has been overwhelmingly positive," Buffa said. "I 
think the only logical way to proceed is to try it and see if it is doing any 
good. We want to know if it is creating an unfair burden on groups." 
</P>
<P>
The policy has no provision for enforcement or monitoring, and it does not 
outline how organizations should implement it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Roeder said Costa Mesa officials have "an obligation to establish some 
guidelines" for screening clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We will work with nonprofit organizations and assist them in drafting some 
guidelines on how to go about this," Roeder said. "We do realize this could 
fundamentally affect how nonprofit groups in the county work."

TRABUCO CANYON NEIGHBORS CONDEMN DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial plan to build 1,700 new homes and a two-lane road in the 
backcountry of southern Orange County near Trabuco Canyon was unveiled Friday 
by county planners who called it a compromise between developers and 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents, however, were quick to condemn it as a "Trojan horse" that 
would end up destroying hundreds of historic oak trees and changing forever the 
character of one of Orange County's last rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed two-lane Rose Canyon Road through Trabuco Canyon "will be the single 
most demoralizing act of development in the entire county," proclaimed Bruce 
Conn, a Trabuco Canyon resident and leader of the Rural Canyons Conservation 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"It will have greater impact than development on Coast Highway between Corona 
del Mar and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, however, said their long-awaited growth blueprint preserves 
the rural character of the 6,500-acre region, while allowing major property 
owners to develop their land in the chaparral-covered canyons and foothills 
east of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, county planners proudly noted that their plan would leave untouched 
much of Live Oak Canyon Road, an oak-lined scenic highway that residents fear 
would be ruined under some development options. 
</P>
<P>
"Rose Canyon Road will allow limited development of Trabuco Canyon without the 
need to upgrade Live Oak Canyon Road," said Lynn Dosherry, chief of the 
county's land planning unit. "It is a trade-off, one that we believe makes 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
The county's seven-page report included general guidelines, but lacked details 
about lot sizes, sewers, streets, specific locations for development and kinds 
of housing that would be allowed. Still, it marked the first time the county 
has indicated a preferred direction in the widening debate over development in 
one of the county's last remaining rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a preliminary plan that tries to strike a balance," Dosherry said. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists and local activists opposed to all but limited growth in 
an area designated as a "rural transition zone" expressed dismay at the 
county's proposal, particularly the construction of Rose Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The three-mile-long road, which would connect Live Oak Canyon Road with Plano 
Trabuco Road, is considered by some the most serious threat to the region 
because it opens up the area to traffic and development and threatens critical 
wildlife migration corridors and habitat on the edge of Cleveland National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"The developers are fools," said Conn, a member of the county's advisory panel 
of citizens and landholders reviewing options for growth in an area now dotted 
by 300 homes, mostly in and around Trabuco Canyon. "This will be the catalyst 
for the strongest anti-growth sentiment yet in this county. . . . I do fear it 
is a Trojan horse. I think the county is trying to sell us on the notion we've 
won, when we haven't." 
</P>
<P>
But Barry Gross, a former developer and also an advisory group member, 
disagreed. He said the county's proposal for new development in the 
Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan area is "fair and equitable." 
</P>
<P>
"A number of people who live in that area have buildable lots and legally they 
are entitled to build," said Gross, an official with the county chapter of the 
Building Industry Assn. "To deny them that right would have been wrong. It's a 
fair plan." 
</P>
<P>
The County Planning Commission is expected to hold hearings on the plan later 
this month, and the Board of Supervisors is expected to consider the issue in 
September. County planners will present their recommendations for the 
Foothill-Trabuco area Wednesday at a meeting with canyon residents at the 
Trabuco Canyon fire station. 
</P>
<P>
Before issuing their recommendation Friday, county planners spent nearly a year 
evaluating four options for growth in the area, ranging from 536 homes to 4,833 
units. Current planning guidelines would allow about 2,450 homes to be built in 
the area, best known for thousands of oak trees that shade the canyons and 
slopes and line the widening rural roads. 
</P>
<P>
Under the county's new proposal, up to 1,700 new homes could be built: 700 in 
the Upper Aliso Canyon area, 500 in Trabuco Canyon and 500 in Plano Trabuco. 
Development densities would vary throughout the area depending on the 
topography and how much other development already exists, Dosherry said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Plano Trabuco, a broad, relatively flat area up to 3 1/2 units 
per acre would be allowed because it is not far from Rancho Santa Margarita 
where there is much high-density development. But in the vicinity of Trabuco 
Canyon, average densities would be much greater with one home for every three 
acres because of the area's steep terrain and its proximity to national forest 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
Densities in Upper Aliso Canyon -- an area easily accessible from Santiago 
Canyon Road and across from the 2,200-home Portola Hills tract -- would be 
about one unit per acre, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
County planners also recommended that two proposed churches on Santiago Canyon 
Road and two neighborhood shopping centers at Cook's Corner be included in the 
final development plan for the area. 
</P>
<P>
But Dosherry said she has concerns about the size and scope of the four 
projects as currently proposed, though her office has not issued any specific 
comments or recommendations on any of the proposals. Saddleback Community 
Church wants to build a 4,800-seat sanctuary, and the Irvine Seventh-day 
Adventist Church has plans for a new church and a private school. The two 
shopping centers would have a total of 105,000 square feet, including a grocery 
store, gas station, retail stores and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Of the county's recommendations, Rose Canyon Road prompted the harshest 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
The road now exists only on the county's master plan of highways and it is 
shown as as a four-lane arterial that would serve as a major commuter link 
between Rancho Santa Margarita and Live Oak Canyon Road. But under the county's 
new plan, Rose Canyon Road would only be a two-lane road designed to carry only 
local traffic and would discourage through-trips by commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Dosherry also said that Rose Canyon Road could be designed and built in such a 
way as to allow wildlife to safely cross or go under the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
But Ray Chandos, chairman of the advisory group and a local activist, said 
construction of Rose Canyon Road will "split the community. . . . Rose Canyon 
Road seems completely inconsistent with the goals of this specific plan to 
preserve the area."

GROUP OPPOSING 6-LANE ROAD PLANS MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group opposed to the widening planned for Bastanchury Road will meet Aug. 17 
to plan an initiative drive to put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Our Bastanchury group will meet at 7:30 p.m. at Emmanuel Episcopal 
Church parish hall, 1145 Valencia Mesa Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Any resident opposed to the plan to widen the road to six lanes between Euclid 
Street and Harbor Boulevard is invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton City Council on July 5 turned down the group's request to stop 
the project, whose cost is estimated at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to appear before the council to ask that the issue be put 
before voters. The group has planned its meeting to discuss the initiative 
drive in the event that the council does not agree to put the matter to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
The group says that widening the road will increase noise and traffic and will 
ruin its scenic, rural nature.

<P>
The Orange County Fire Department is asking for the public's help in 
identifying some children who apparently started a brush fire at Featherly 
Regional Park on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned about 200 acres of brush from the park to Coal Canyon Road, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"An investigation by the Orange County Fire Department has determined that the 
fire . . . was started by children playing with fire," Hank Raymond, the 
county's fire information officer, said in a statement. Anyone with information 
is asked to contact the department at (714) 744-0514. 
</P>

23 JOIN BID FOR COUNCIL IN CITYHOOD ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-three candidates will compete for five city council seats in the Nov. 7 
cityhood election for Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates include all five current members of the Laguna Niguel Community 
Services District, an elected body that takes care of streets, lighting and 
parks. The candidates also include seven of the 13 members of the Laguna Niguel 
Community Council, an elected, advisory group to county government. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon was the deadline for filing for the election, in which Laguna 
Niguel voters will decide if they want to become Orange County's 29th city. If 
a majority of those voting punch the yes for cityhood option on their ballots, 
a city council will also come into being. 
</P>
<P>
The five persons receiving the highest number of votes will be elected to that 
council but will take office only if the cityhood proposal passes. 
</P>
<P>
Most south Orange County political observers predict an overwhelmingly 
favorable vote by Laguna Niguel for cityhood. Opinion polls also have shown 
strong voter sentiment for incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any group organized against cityhood," said Mike Walsh, one of 
the candidates for the proposed city council. Walsh, who was at the registrar 
of voters' office in Santa Ana as the 5 p.m. filing deadline approached Friday, 
said he thinks that most Laguna Niguel residents want to become a city so that 
they can better control development. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Christiansen, a director of the Laguna Niguel Community Services District, 
also predicted overwhelming voter support for cityhood. Christiansen, who is 
among the 23 candidates for city council, said he had been "campaigning out at 
shopping centers in Laguna Niguel, and I'd say that less than 1% of those I 
meet are opposed to cityhood." 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, south Orange County has had a flurry of interest in 
forming new cities. Last year voters approved cityhood for both Mission Viejo 
and Dana Point. The proposal for cityhood narrowly lost last June in Laguna 
Hills, which borders Laguna Niguel to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the current Laguna Niguel situation, Laguna Hills had a community schism 
over cityhood, with opposition coming primarily from the residents of Leisure 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Laguna Hills pro-cityhood advocates were told by an official of the 
Local Agency Formation Commission that they should wait until after the Laguna 
Niguel election before attempting another try at cityhood. Residents in other 
areas of south Orange County also will be watching the Laguna Niguel election 
closely. If cityhood fails there, parts of the area could be annexed by nearby 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel residents already are fuming over Dana Point's success in making 
Monarch Beach a part of its incorporation into cityhood last year. Laguna 
Niguel originally proposed inclusion of Monarch Beach within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
There are two lawsuits pending that challenge Dana Point's right to the 1 
1/2-mile coastal strip in Monarch Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed on the Nov. 7 ballot, the city of Laguna Niguel would be an inland 
city, bordered by Dana Point on the south, Laguna Beach on the west, Mission 
Viejo on the east and Laguna Hills on the north. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Christiansen, the other four incumbent members of the Laguna 
Niguel Community Services District also filed for the proposed city council. 
They are James F. Krembas, Larry A. Porter, Patricia C. Bates and Marc E. 
Leever. Porter and Leever were appointed, rather than elected, to fill 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Bates is also a member of the Laguna Niguel Community Council. In addition to 
Bates and Walsh, the other community council members who filed for the proposed 
city council are Thomas W. Wilson, Lynn P. Kentfield, Roger Lance, Eli Naffah 
and Richard Steinhoff. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates who completed filing for the election were: Eddie Rose, 
Neil Burns, Abel Armas, Dennis W. Fletcher, E.J. (Jim) Hinkson, Daniel Jeffrey 
Cohen, Wilbur Davidson, Mark Goodman, Chris Devendorf, Maureen McManus, William 
Thomas Doyle and Frank E. Hotchkiss.

TRIAL COSTS MAY BE SECRET UNTIL EXECUTION; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE WON'T GIVE FINAL TALLY UNTIL MURDERER'S APPEALS ARE EXHAUSTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
While his case almost certainly will be among the most expensive in California 
history, Randy Steven Kraft may be executed before the public knows the cost of 
his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas, who sealed the defense ledgers five 
years ago, said this week that he doesn't plan to unseal them until all of 
Kraft's appeals are exhausted. Unless Kraft is granted a new trial, the final 
appeal would continue to the moment Kraft steps into the gas chamber at San 
Quentin State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not even be here when that day finally comes, but until I get some 
guidance from the courts, my plan is to keep everything sealed," Cardenas said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
That plan means that legal experts can only speculate how expensive Kraft's 
trial, paid by taxpayers, might be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Estimates 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the district attorney's office estimated to the Board of 
Supervisors that the bill for Kraft's defense would be $2 million. Kraft's 
lawyers, however, called the figure "ridiculously high." 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County court administrator Alan Slater said the trial no doubt will 
rank as the most expensive ever in Orange County. Some lawyers and judges in 
the county have estimated its total cost at a minimum of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the costs in the McMartin preschool case in Los Angeles County 
are listed at $11.1 million for the first five years, up to the end of 1988, 
according to county auditor-controller records. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said that the monthly costs of the Kraft case are lower than those in 
the McMartin molestation case, according to information he has. Both cases 
began six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Staff Costs 
</P>
<P>
The average daily cost of a criminal trial is $7,100, according to a Los 
Angeles County Superior Court study due for completion soon. But the Kraft case 
could cost more than that because of the number of lawyers and the paid experts 
who testified. 
</P>
<P>
On the district attorney's side, the Kraft case has involved one prosecutor and 
three full-time investigators. But other lawyers in the office have worked on 
the case at times. Also, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown has relied on a 
battery of pathologists, crime lab experts, and others who were paid for their 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Also, prosecutors have had to pay expenses of witnesses flown in from Oregon 
and Michigan, where Kraft is accused of killing eight people. 
</P>
<P>
On the defense side, two lawyers have worked full time on the Kraft case for 
five years. A third lawyer has worked almost full time for four years. The 
lawyers have hired at least five private investigators, two paralegals, a 
criminalist with as many as five others working for him at one point, and a 
variety of other experts, such as specialists in computer graphics and 
photography, for example. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raises for the Defense 
</P>
<P>
Most of these people not only have been on the payroll year after year, but 
Cardenas grudgingly has allowed most of them cost-of-living raises. Kraft's two 
trial lawyers, for example, began at $75 an hour, but got a raise to $90 an 
hour. Their legal motions expert, William J. Kopeny, was paid $50 an hour, and 
then refused to join in a request for more pay. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said he has no guarantee that the defense money was always spent 
wisely. But he added he has high confidence in the integrity of Kraft's 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say that Mr. Kraft will never be able to argue he did not get a fair 
trial because he has not been properly funded," Cardenas said. "We have spent a 
lot of money on his behalf." 
</P>
<P>
Two issues could force Cardenas to change his mind about keeping the cost 
figures sealed. 
</P>
<P>
One is the Joselito Cinco case in San Diego County. Cinco committed suicide in 
prison last year a few months after he was sentenced to death for the murder of 
two San Diego police officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cinco Case Cited 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in that case want the defense costs released to the public. With 
Cinco dead, they argue, no one can say public access to the figures could 
affect any new trial for him. But Cinco's lawyers have been joined by many 
leaders among the county's trial lawyers. They do not want the figures 
released, ever. "I'm watching that case very carefully to see what happens," 
Cardenas said. "Certainly it could affect what I end up doing in the Kraft 
case." 
</P>
<P>
When Cardenas was assigned by the court to oversee the defense costs, he not 
only sealed the records of the defense lawyers' expenses, as the law requires, 
but also of their fees, as a precaution against any unfavorable pretrial 
publicity about it. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us wanted to see a change of venue to another county," Cardenas said. 
"That could have meant three times the expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas has said before that the Kraft case could set a precedent in the state 
for expenses. But after reading the McMartin case figures, Cardenas said he 
could only guess that the Kraft case will be among the most expensive in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Public's Right to Know' 
</P>
<P>
Court administrator Slater said he does not plan to spend any time adding up 
the costs in the case unless the courts request it. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the public's right to know, but to be honest, it has no real 
meaning to me," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said he also recognizes the value in the argument that the public has 
the right to know how its money was spent, especially when so much money was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
But he won't unseal the records because it is always possible that Kraft could 
win a new trial, and release of the figures could affect a future jury. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, you have to have faith in someone in the system," the judge 
said.

TRIAL CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a chronology of the Randy Steven Kraft murder trial, from his arrest 
six years ago to the jury's penalty finding Friday. 
</P>
<P>
May 14, 1983 -- Kraft is arrested on Interstate 5 in Mission Viejo. Two 
California Highway Patrol officers who stop him on suspicion of drunk driving 
find a dead Marine in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 26, 1983 -- Preliminary hearing begins before Santa Ana Municipal Judge 
John J. Ryan on 16 murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 18, 1983 -- Ryan orders Kraft to stand trial on all 16 murders. He seals 
from public view a list found in Kraft's car that prosecutors say is a death 
list of Kraft's victims. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 25, 1983 -- Kraft lawyer Fred W. McBride quits the case after Kraft 
attacks him in a Times interview. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 16, 1983 -- Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown files notice with the court 
that he will accuse Kraft of an additional 20 murders in the penalty phase of 
the trial, including six murders in Oregon and two in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 20, 1984 -- Superior Court Judge James K. Turner permits the first of more 
than a dozen postponements in Kraft's trial date, stretched out over the next 4 
1/2 years, almost all at the defense's request. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 6, 1984 -- Kraft lawyer Douglas W. Otto is relieved from the case, at 
Kraft's request. Co-counsel James G. Merwin, who replaced McBride, remains. The 
same week, Chief Deputy Public Defender C. Thomas McDonald resigns his post to 
join Merwin as co-counsel for Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 30, 1985 -- Prosecutor Brown files an amended complaint accusing Kraft of 
one more penalty-phase murder, making the total in the case 37. 
</P>
<P>
May 2, 1985 -- Kraft's attorneys persuade Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas 
that the case is so massive that a third attorney is needed to defend Kraft. 
The judge appoints William J. Kopeny, who also resigns from the public 
defender's office to take the position. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 14, 1987 -- Over vigorous objections from prosecutors after a two-week 
hearing, Cardenas permits the defense its eighth delay in the trial date. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 18, 1987 -- Judge Turner, after another lengthy debate over the trial 
date, finds that the defense no longer has grounds to delay the trial. He 
orders the trial to begin immediately after the search warrant hearings, 
scheduled to end in December. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 22, 1987 -- Judge Turner begins a search warrant hearing that will 
ultimately span eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 29, 1987 -- Judge Turner undergoes emergency heart surgery, which puts the 
trial date on hold again. He is removed from the Kraft trial but will continue 
with the search warrant hearing after his recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 5, 1988 -- Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin is assigned to preside 
at the Kraft trial. 
</P>
<P>
March 18, 1988 -- Turner denies the motion to quash the search warrants, which 
paves the way for the trial to finally begin. 
</P>
<P>
June 25, 1988 -- Judge McCartin denies the defense motion to separate the Kraft 
case into multiple trials. Though the courtroom is nearly empty for the 
hearing, the Kraft lawyers view it as the most critical day in the entire case. 
</P>
<P>
July 19, 1988 -- The Kraft trial begins with the first preliminary stages of 
jury selection. The judge warns prospective jurors during the week that the 
trial could last more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 23, 1988 -- Judge McCartin announces he will unseal key documents, 
including the complete list from Kraft's car, once the jurors have heard 
opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 26, 1988 -- Opening statements are made at the Kraft trial, and the first 
testimony begins. In addition, prosecution papers unsealed by the judge reveal 
that the Kraft list has 61 entries. Also revealed for the first time are eight 
additional murders -- all in Los Angeles County -- of which prosecutor Brown 
has accused Kraft, even though he does not plan to use them at the trial. That 
puts the total at 45. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 30, 1988 -- After 10 weeks of testimony, Brown completes his case. The 
judge grants the defense a four-week delay to begin, which later turns into two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 30, 1989 -- The defense, granted an additional delay, begins its case. 
</P>
<P>
April 27, 1989 -- Closing arguments are completed, and the judge instructs the 
jury, then sequesters them at a local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
April 28, 1989 -- The jury begins its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
May 12, 1989 -- The jury returns its verdicts: guilty of first-degree murder of 
all 16 victims. 
</P>
<P>
June 5, 1989 -- The penalty phase begins. Jurors will decide whether Kraft 
shall receive life in prison without parole or be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 9, 1989 -- Jurors begin their deliberations in the penalty phase.

FOREIGN FLAIR COMES TO KITCHENS AS EUROPEAN FEATURES FLOURISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is taking notice of the beauty, quality and efficiency of 
European kitchen design. 
</P>
<P>
German-made cabinets, British cooktops and ovens, Swedish dishwashers, Swiss 
faucets and sinks, and American countertops and floors blend together to create 
a fresh, universal appeal, making a kitchen that can be as functional as it is 
elegant. 
</P>
<P>
Ettie Ettinger, owner of Kitchen Gallery in Laguna Beach, says European 
kitchens began growing in popularity, first on the East Coast, about five years 
ago. "In New York, kitchens are usually quite small -- at least compared to 
here. One must make the most of every available inch of space. In Europe, 
kitchens are even smaller, and energy is at a premium, so people learned to be 
resourceful." 
</P>
<P>
It was that resourcefulness that led to the creation of such space savers as 
frame-less cabinets, shallow pantries and corner cabinet carrousels. Innovative 
cabinets offer such features as built-in pullout bread and snack bins, deep 
drawers that pull out for easy storage of pots and pans, cooking hobs that 
allow access from three sides, and swing-up storage bins that lock into place 
during use. 
</P>
<P>
Cabinets are available in a variety of woods, laminated finishes and lacquers. 
Hundreds of cabinet fronts and handle combinations make it possible to 
completely change the style of the room. Charlotte Barnhoorn, a Laguna 
Niguel-based interior designer, says that a dramatic effect can be achieved by 
simply changing a kitchen knob or handle. "You can take a basic lacquered 
cabinet, and by changing handles, toe-kicks, light valances and crown molding, 
anything from country to contemporary can be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Brenda Graham of Laguna Niguel recently moved into a newly built home 
in Coronado Point. Brenda asked Barnhoorn to decorate the home, emphasizing her 
taste for a contemporary, eclectic look. The smooth, cream-colored, lacquered 
cabinets are set into a slim frame with narrow groove and finished with 
hand-dipped brass knobs. Countertops and back splash are of black granite. A 
cream-colored marble floor completes the design. 
</P>
<P>
The Grahams enjoy cooking in their new kitchen. "The cabinets are wonderful for 
many reasons," Brenda says. "They are fingerprint-resistant, and shelf height 
is adjustable. The granite countertop is indestructible, and like the floor, 
you just use plain water to clean it." Brenda says that storage drawers for 
pots and pans make for easy access and eliminate bending, stooping and reaching 
for frequently used items. Cabinets are maintained as with any fine wood -- 
dusted regularly and polished occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Ettinger believes that European-style kitchens -- which can be installed in 
existing homes at a cost of $20,000 to $50,000 -- are ideal for homes that are 
being remodeled. "Many people are remodeling homes that were built in the 
1940s, '50s, '60s. Many of the homes are in Laguna; the kitchens are very, very 
small and they have less amperage. With this system, you can accommodate 
existing amperage and plumbing without the cost of having to add to it." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Busk, founder and president of Busk Development in Dana Point, has current 
projects at Ritz Cove and Laguna Niguel and several remodeling jobs in Monarch 
Beach and Newport Beach. He began using European kitchens a year ago, when he 
saw them exhibited at a design and trade show. An architect had drawn kitchen 
plans for a house he was developing. Wanting to maximize efficiency, Busk asked 
that the plans be modified. "What I ended up with was something completely 
different -- more sophisticated, a slicker look. Within the next five years, I 
believe that most custom homes will emulate the European flair for design," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bradshaw, territory manager for Schreiber, a Southgate-based company that 
distributes Creda cooktops and ovens, believes that Creda -- a British company 
and a division of General Electric of the United Kingdom -- and other foreign 
brands, such as Gaggenau, Miele and Asea, have surpassed American large 
appliances because of their efficiency and styling. "We believe our products, 
Creda gas glass cooktops and ovens, are the most sophisticated on the market. 
The entire unit is only two inches deep and is designed to fit wherever you 
want it to go. It can be fitted over a drawer or dropped into a cutout space." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw believes that a fundamental advantage of foreign cooktops and ovens 
over American brands is efficiency. He says that these appliances use 30% less 
energy and cause 80% less spills. Sealed spillage wells keep spills out of the 
cooktop interior and stop them from seeping over the surface, Bradshaw 
explains. "The advanced burner design combines the burner cap and burner ring," 
he says. "This gives a greater performance. High-speed burners and low-speed 
burners are capable of the highest boil or the lowest controlled simmer." 
</P>
<P>
Cooktops and ovens are available in white or charcoal. White models are 
finished in high-quality optical glass, providing a vivid, "white-on-white" 
look. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, American manufacturers have begun to lose their 
foothold in the large-appliance industry, according to Bradshaw. The growing 
popularity of small appliances made by Braun, Krupp and Toshiba introduced 
American consumers to the sleek look and efficiency of foreign appliances. The 
American appliance industry recognized a need to upgrade design and efficiency. 
Consumers are beginning to see such manufacturers as Kitchen-Aid and Tappan 
introduce new designs that appeal to more discerning consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Countertops bear no resemblance to the once shiny, plastic Formica of the 
1950s. Now, styles and patterns that both look and feel like marble can be 
found. Textured Formica resembles leather and is completely washable. Corian, 
touted as a miracle product from DuPont, is available in a wide assortment of 
colors and patterns and is durable and stain-resistant. Accidental knife nicks 
can be easily sanded away. Corian is often mistaken for marble, alabaster or 
onyx. For those who prefer everlasting beauty and durability, granite is a 
natural choice. 
</P>
<P>
Flooring has changed dramatically, too. Now available is vinyl tile that 
requires little maintenance, is scuff-resistant and can be cleaned with only 
soap and water while retaining its shine. The trend is toward natural stone, 
but woods such as oak, spruce and pine are also favorites.

Contrary to popular opinion, plants can be both water-conserving and 
attractive. Below is a list of plants compiled by the Metropolitan Water 
District of Orange County, selected for their combination of good looks and 
good sense. Some are Southern California natives, while others are products of 
other areas of the world with similar climates -- hot, dry summers and cool, 
moist winters. Plants adapted to this climate require less water than plants 
from wetter climates.

More than half the water used around the typical Orange County home is used 
outdoors. A landscape concept called xeriscape -- derived from the Greek word 
xeros, meaning 'dry' -- can help conserve the precious commodity. Xeriscape 
uses landscape designs and plants that fit the natural environment -- which in 
Orange County means dry. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to picking drought-tolerant plants, xeriscape calls for efficient 
garden planning and proper techniques for watering and planting. Some xeriscape 
concepts: 
</P>
<P>
Pick the right plant for the space: North and east sides of the home, for 
instance, tend to be cooler and wetter than south and west sides. A deciduous 
shade tree on the south side can help cool the house in summer yet allow extra 
sun in winter, when the leaves drop. When selecting plants, consider their 
mature size. 
</P>
<P>
Grass requires lots of water and maintenance. Do not plant it except where it 
will be used for play or entertaining -- never in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Hardscape" -- patios, walkways, paths and planters -- can make good use of 
space and reduce the area that needs to be watered. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure sprinklers operate efficiently. Do not water streets and sidewalks, 
and do not turn sprinklers so high that water floats away in a mist. When 
watering, percolate water into the soil, do not run it over the surface. Make 
sure no standing puddles form after watering. 
</P>
<P>
Group plants with similar water requirements together. Water at night or 
morning to avoid excessive evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
Fall, winter and spring are the best times to plant. New xeriscaped plants do 
need plenty of water to keep the roots moist until they are established. 
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Water District of Orange County has a number of brochures and 
other materials on water-conserving gardening techniques, including sample 
garden plans. Write to the district office at the following address to request

Careful attention to watering practices is a priority in August. The best time 
to water plants is in the early morning to help prevent disease problems and 
sun scald. To help remove harmful salts from the root zones of plants, leech 
the soil by placing a hose with a slow trickle of water near the base of plants 
for a couple of hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
August is the best month to plant cool-season vegetables. Broccoli, 
cauliflower, lettuce, carrots, radishes and kale are some of the choices 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds of cool-season annuals such as pansies, snapdragons, stock and Iceland 
poppies can also be started now. Fertilize chrysanthemums with a balanced 
fertilizer such as 15-30-15 for more abundant fall blooming. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlias are at their peak bloom now. Check local garden centers for some of the 
many varieties available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AND GENERAL AUGUST CARE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
1. To conserve moisture in container plantings, be sure to mulch. 
</P>
<P>
2. For some red hot color in the hot summer garden, plant salvia. 
</P>
<P>
3. Have a mildew problem on your roses or crape Myrtles? You may be watering 
too late in the day. Try watering in the early morning or at least by late 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
4. Take down your hanging baskets every now and then to give them a good 
soaking either by dunking them in a bucket or by running the water hose over 
them very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
5. Fertilize lawns as well as shrubs, flowers and vegetables at six-week 
intervals during the summer. Avoid fertilizing just before going on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
6. Keep tomato plants supported with cages so they won't sprawl on the ground 
and damage or dirty the tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
7. Frequent trimming of hedges promotes new green growth for a full, dense look 
instead of a bare, woody look.

WHEN IT COMES TO DOCKS, WATERFRONT DWELLERS CALL FOR SWIFT SLIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Life.

Not everyone who lives on the water has a boat, but most have a dock. No matter 
what its shape or size, a dock is an integral part of waterfront living -- sort 
of a floating, open-air garage. But constructing a dock is more complicated 
than building a garage. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a different kind of construction than any other," says Pete Swift. 
</P>
<P>
Swift, 33, and his brother, Tom, 30 -- owners of Swift Slip -- are among a 
handful of harbor craftsmen who specialize in building, servicing and repairing 
waterfront docks and piers. 
</P>
<P>
As dock builders, the Swifts not only have to deal with weather, wind and tide, 
they also have to answer to six or more governing agencies -- including the 
Army Corps of Engineers -- that regulate on-the-water construction. On a recent 
job, it took four months to get the proper permits but only two weeks to do the 
job, Pete Swift says. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Swifts' jobs have taken them from San Diego to Malibu, the 
majority of their work is done in Orange County, where Swift Slip is 
headquartered. Working out of a small construction yard in Huntington Beach, 
the company, which has three full-time employees in addition to the two 
brothers, averages 35 to 40 jobs a year. "We do everything from painting and 
repairing to building from scratch," Pete says. 
</P>
<P>
Most Swift Slip customers are waterfront homeowners. And a typical job begins 
with a visit to city hall to find out if the job the customer wants done is 
feasible. If it is, then the Swifts prepare an estimate and negotiate a 
contract. "Next we have an engineer who actually designs the dock and figures 
out how big the floats should be," Pete says. "Some reconstruction jobs don't 
require an engineer because the new dock is just being built like the old 
dock." 
</P>
<P>
Once the design is finished, special pressure-treated lumber -- to prevent dry 
rot -- is ordered from a supplier in Oregon. Other materials include 
plastic-foam floats, plastic tubs (to house the floats), cleats, hardware and 
rollers (so the dock can rise and fall easily against the pilings as the tide 
changes). 
</P>
<P>
When all the materials are in, the dock is built in the Huntington Beach 
construction yard and trucked to the harbor. Since most of Swift Slip's 
customers are in Newport Beach, most docks are launched at Lido Shipyard, where 
they are rafted together and floated to the installation site to be assembled. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a new dock is $25,000, and the average size is 40 feet in 
length, Pete Swift says. On the high end was a dock the Swifts built recently 
at a Newport Beach home -- it measured more than 100 feet in length and cost 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
One of the company's most unusual jobs involved constructing a dock that would 
be moored offshore, just past the surf line, near Malibu. "The man we built it 
for was going to rent jet skis from it," Tom Swift says. "We had to truck the 
dock up to Malibu and push it through the surf. It was a tough job." 
</P>
<P>
Another unusual job involved the construction of a 20-slip marina in front of 
the Chart House Restaurant in Newport Beach. "In order to be able to build the 
marina, we first had to remove an old dry dock that had been sunk," Pete says. 
"Nobody knew how big the thing was so we had to hire a diver to go down and 
attach floats to it to float it up. An hour and a half later, one corner came 
up and it was huge. By the time the whole thing was out of the water, it looked 
as big as an aircraft carrier. It floated eight feet out of the water and was 
covered with barnacles. We knew that pretty soon it was going to start stinking 
so we had to get it out of there fast." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the 20-slip marina has been Swift Slip's biggest job. "Most of our jobs 
are at private homes and involve changing an existing dock," Tom Swift says. 
"The person may have gotten a bigger boat and needs a bigger slip or sometimes 
they just want to upgrade or redecorate." 
</P>
<P>
The Swifts work only with pressure-treated wood, left natural and unpainted. 
"Most people today are getting away from painting," Pete Swift says. "When it 
is painted, you have to repaint it once a year and painting pollutes the bay." 
</P>
<P>
Although dock building is a year-round business in Southern California, the 
Swifts say their busiest months are June through October. "Back East this would 
be a seasonal business. You'd have only six good months to put in docks, but 
here the weather is good all year long. So even though summer is always busier, 
we work year-round." 
</P>
<P>
The Swifts, who grew up on Balboa Peninsula, say they love their work and 
"learned by doing." 
</P>
<P>
"We had a friend we grew up with who built docks," Pete Swift says. "And then 
when I got my first job, I learned by actually taking the dock apart and seeing 
how it was built." 
</P>
<P>
It was Pete Swift, a UCLA business graduate, who actually founded the company 
in 1982 and ran it alone, until his brother, Tom, joined him a year later. 
"That first year I only did three docks and I was having to do auto-body work 
in the winter to keep going," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Today, both brothers are glad they stayed with the business. "Deep down we love 
the water," Tom Swift says. "And doing what we are doing makes us feel we are 
doing something special with our lives."

FRENCH DOORS USHER IN A TRADITIONAL LOOK TO HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL, Nancy Jo Hill is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners who have grown weary of that old aluminum sliding glass door leading 
to the patio or balcony are finding an easy way to turn their view of the world 
from blah to beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
They are replacing that old slider with French doors or a French slider, which 
has all the beauty of traditional wooden, multiple-pane French doors. 
</P>
<P>
Retrofitting patio doorways with these more traditional looks is a hot trend in 
home remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
When you consider what remodeling costs these days, changing a door is pretty 
reasonable. Double French door sets are available from $500 up to $1,800, 
depending on options, and sliders range from $800 to about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
These systems are designed to go into openings of existing five-, six- and 
eight-foot patio doors. Installation averages from $270 to $500, and all doors 
are installed unfinished, which means you must paint or stain them or hire 
someone to do it for you. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been selling French doors myself over 10 years," says Donna French, sales 
manager for Fine Finish in Huntington Beach. "But of course, they've become 
more and more popular." She says Fine Finish had to expand to meet the demand 
and now has stores in Irvine and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
French says Fine Finish added sliders about three years ago because "we saw a 
need for it. There (were) a lot of people who wanted a sliding door. . . . It 
looks as good as your traditional door." 
</P>
<P>
The easiest and best way to improve your home "is to change your doors and 
windows," says Keith Powell, chairman of Atlanta Door and Window in Laguna 
Hills and Orange. "It's not that expensive. It adds tremendous value to your 
house, and it makes you feel like you live in a whole different house." 
</P>
<P>
Irene Lamb agrees. 
</P>
<P>
When she moved from Boston to a 20-year-old tract house in Fountain Valley four 
years ago, she longed to add a more classic look to her home. The sliding glass 
door in her family room was practical, yet she preferred the romantic look of 
French doors so popular on the Eastern Seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Lamb solved her dilemma. She chose a French slider and replaced a 
window in the same room with a French bay window with beveled glass. 
</P>
<P>
She originally planned to stain the wood frames, but her "East Coast 
traditionalism brought me back to that Cape Cod look." They were painted white 
in the true classic style. 
</P>
<P>
"I like looking in at it when we go outside," Lamb says of her transformed 
family room, to which she also added new carpeting, paint and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"I like looking through those windows and through the door with the lights on. 
It gives it a beautiful look. I would say it's a very relaxing look." 
</P>
<P>
George Vizmeg of Mission Viejo chose French windows and doors because he 
thought it would give his four-year-old Spanish-style house a different look. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, it did," Vizmeg says. The style looks "beautiful in the type of 
home we have." 
</P>
<P>
He had his whole house retrofitted with French doors and windows, including a 
front entry with a double French door topped with half-circle windows matched 
by half-circle windows in the three-car garage. He also had a French door 
installed to replace an aluminum slider leading from a breakfast nook area to 
the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
It's more common for people to replace one or two doors at a time as they 
upgrade their houses, according to Roger Cerny of Roger Cerny Door Co. in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"The largest percentage of people can afford maybe one thing at a time," says 
Cerny. "They want to have something nice because they can't afford to go out 
and buy that big house." 
</P>
<P>
He says there's "something serene" about the French-door look that makes a 
house special, even if you change only one door. 
</P>
<P>
Powell says his customers tend to retrofit one section of a house at a time 
over a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"When we begin the conversation," he says, "they're certainly interested in the 
patio doors. A lot of the times they're surprised at how inexpensive this is 
compared to how they expected it to be. And, within their budget, they may 
decide they want to replace all the patio doors upstairs and downstairs, or 
maybe they want to get a bay window." 
</P>
<P>
Changing sliders is also a good portion of the Pella Window Store's remodeling 
market, and cost is a factor for many of those customers, according to Wendy 
Williams. Williams is advertising and promotion coordinator for the firm, which 
has stores in Fullerton, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
She says that her company offers both sliders and French doors but that the 
French slider is probably more popular because of the lower price. The base 
price of both Pella doors is around $1,300, but the slider includes hardware 
and a screen, and the true French door does not. That means an additional $200 
for hardware and $330 for optional screens, Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
Pella's doors are different from most of the wood French doors on the market. 
The exterior frames are covered with aluminum cladding in white, brown, tan or 
gray, while wood shows on the interior side of the door. Pella does this for 
"low maintenance to protect the wood against the elements," according to 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
When considering French doors or sliders for your house, there are several 
things to think about besides the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Most French doors don't come with screens over the doors to keep out mosquitoes 
and flies. If this is a problem, you might want a slider with a screen. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pella does make a unit with two French doors that open in and matching 
screens that swing out. Atlanta will soon offer a six-foot unit that has one 
fixed door (really a large window) with another door hinged to it and a sliding 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other options to consider. For a six-foot opening, you might want 
two French doors or a single French door with two side panels with screens. The 
panels can be opened manually or with a crank. Eight-foot units have two French 
doors and two side panels. 
</P>
<P>
Space is another factor in selection. French doors can open in or out, but 
there must be enough clearance whichever option you choose. So if space is a 
problem, a slider may be preferable. 
</P>
<P>
It's also helpful to understand the terms grids and true divided light. Pella's 
standard doors are either one large window or have grids sandwiched between two 
panes of glass to give the look of individual panes. The doors at Fine Finish, 
Pella's custom doors and most of those at Atlanta are "true divided light," 
composed of individual panes of glass. Cerny offers both styles. 
</P>
<P>
And if security is a concern, it's just a matter of a proper lock for French 
doors, most installers say. They suggest a double-keyed lock because it 
requires a key to open it. Even if a burglar broke out a pane or two in the 
door, he would still be unable to open it.

GETTING SCREENS TO MESH WITH THE DECOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's sometimes hard to admit, but no matter how handy we are, most of us can't 
do everything -- nor should we. Some chores are simply too time-consuming, 
others take too much special knowledge and some are just not cost-efficient to 
do yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have or want to make a set of wood-frame screens to complement an 
older home with wooden sash windows, screens will fall into that last category 
-- and they might fit into the first two as well. 
</P>
<P>
We don't think about window screens very much -- that is, not until the house 
fills with flies, mosquitoes or whatever other pesky flying insect is in 
season. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, most people who decide to replace their screens go down to 
the local hardware store and have a set with shiny aluminum frames made. These 
may not do much for the look of the home, but they will keep the bugs out for a 
while and they don't cost very much. 
</P>
<P>
Screens, like a lot of other seemingly simple things, however, have become 
complex over the years. Even if repairing old ones or building new ones is a 
task we would rather leave to a professional, there are more than a few things 
to consider before placing that order. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Betty and Carl Ziegler, proprietors of Sav-On Glass and Screen in 
Westminster, who are 20-year veterans of the business. Carl is a bit more 
taciturn, but at the drop of a question, Betty can easily do an hour on the 
subject without repeating herself. 
</P>
<P>
And what she has to say is worth listening to. 
</P>
<P>
First, those ubiquitous shiny aluminum frames that fade to a dull silver in a 
single season are far from being the only way to go -- although those are 
usually all you can find at hardware stores and home-improvement centers. 
</P>
<P>
They are by far the cheapest way to go, yes, but before you commit yourself to 
a house that will look as if it is undergoing orthodontia, stop and think: Do 
you have wooden windows? If so, what color are they painted? Aluminum screen 
frames come in several colors now: the standard shiny silver or mill finish; an 
anodized silver that helps resist corrosion in salty coastal air; an anodized 
gold; and painted finishes in gold, gray, white and bronze (actually closer to 
a dull black). 
</P>
<P>
Frame widths also come in different sizes -- the standard 3/4-inch and a 
beefier 1-inch that is visible enough to make an architectural statement if, 
say, you use a color that contrasts with the main trimming color on your house. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the screen materials themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Screens in older homes were made of aluminum mesh, and hardware stores still do 
a decent business selling a harsh acidic cleanser to those trying to eliminate 
the grungy, streaked look of older aluminum screens. That screen material, 
however, was actually covered with a thin coat of aluminum paint when it was 
made, Betty Ziegler says, so that the streaking you see isn't dirt but rather 
bare mesh showing where the paint has worn away. That's something you can't 
really fix; you would be better off getting new screens made. 
</P>
<P>
Screen material nowadays is generally made of Fiberglas mesh, which won't 
discolor and can be washed with a mild soap solution. Just be sure to rinse the 
heck out of the ones you wash, because the soap can rot the screen fabric. 
</P>
<P>
The new screen fabrics come in gray, black or green, but the Zieglers recommend 
black because it doesn't reflect light and thus becomes almost invisible. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a window where the sun really blasts through and you don't want to 
tint the window itself, you could try sun screening. This is woven with a 
heavier material that will block as much as 75% of the light and heat from the 
sun. A sun screen will cost more, and it's a lot more visible than a regular 
screen, but having it can help cut air conditioning bills. Sun screening comes 
in gray, charcoal, bronze and gold. 
</P>
<P>
Some purists insist on real bronze -- made from fine bronze wire -- for their 
screens, but the Zieglers say that its only real advantage is that it has a 
decorative gold color. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, they say, the average exterior window screen will last five 
or six years in an inland area and two to three years within three miles of the 
coast. Interior screens generally will last 10 years. The Zieglers point out, 
though, that those life-expectancy figures don't take into account dogs, cats, 
kids, baseballs and other flying objects. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to have screens remade, the Zieglers strongly recommend that you 
bring in each of the old ones to be individually measured. This is especially 
important in a house that has had an addition whose windows are of a different 
manufacture from the original. 
</P>
<P>
Window makers have not yet imposed standard sizing, and a number of widths and 
thicknesses are used in wood or metal sliding or casement windows with interior 
screens that fit into special slots or pockets in the window frame. Further, 
the channels into which the screen mesh is pressed can vary in depth and width 
from one frame maker to another. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing to remember," Betty Ziegler says, "is that most screens are 
best made if they are custom made, because nothing is standardized. If you go 
down to the hardware store and buy a prefab 3-foot by 4-foot screen, chances 
are it won't fit right, especially in the new metal windows." 
</P>
<P>
If you have wooden windows and are looking for new exterior screens, the 
Zieglers recommend subtracting 1/4 inch from the width of the opening and 1/8 
inch from the height so as to ensure that the screen will fit without having to 
be jammed in but still be tight enough to prevent insects from infiltrating 
from around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if you just plain don't like the look of aluminum screens, it isn't 
too difficult to make wood frames yourself in your workshop. All you need to do 
is build a simple rectangular frame, generally out of 1-inch pine or fir cut as 
narrow or wide as you like. You can peg the joints or just glue and fasten them 
with corrugated metal fasteners or even with flat L-shaped metal angles (see 
illustration A). 
</P>
<P>
To make the job easier, the Zieglers suggest rabbeting a step around the inside 
edge and dropping an aluminum framed screen into it, fastening it with short 
wood screws driven through the aluminum frame and into the wood (see 
illustration B). 
</P>
<P>
You can also route your own mounting groove and press the screen into that with 
either a wooden molding or a rubber strip, or you can staple the screen cloth 
to the frame and cover the edge with a piece of molding painted in either a 
matching or contrasting color (see illustration C). 
</P>
<P>
The builders of many older homes originally installed wood-frame screens that 
had ornamental-looking brass hinges at the top or on one side. Those look nice, 
and they make it easy to swing the screens out of the way to wash the windows.

Summer is a good time to stop and smell the flowers, but it may be an even 
better time to stop and shoot the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Photographing flowers can be as simple or complicated as you want to make it. 
You can use an automatic point-and-shoot camera or a more advanced camera with 
a macro lens, extension tubes, bellows or close-up filters. You can even 
consider additional lighting, reflectors or strobes. 
</P>
<P>
The first and foremost concern should be shooting photographs and enjoying 
nature. So don't get bogged down in technique. After choosing a film, scan a 
nature book just to give you an idea of different ways to look at flowers and 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes nature needs a helping hand. So take along a spray bottle of water to 
mist your subject. 
</P>
<P>
A factor you need to consider is the wind. A gentle breeze can blur your 
subject, unless you use a shutter speed fast enough to stop the movement of 
your subject. For this reason, many people prefer to shoot in the calm of the 
early morning hours. Another way to beat the problem is to have someone hold 
the plant still or block the wind with a piece of cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
A tripod will help keep your camera steady and make your picture sharper. 
Unfortunately, sometimes the location or angle may make it impossible to use a 
tripod. In that case, you must brace yourself as you squeeze the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to follow basic photography rules. Pay attention to your 
composition, background, lighting, depth of field and exposure. Also, look for 
unusual patterns in the leaves or flowers to give your photo a different 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Shoot your subject at every conceivable angle. A different angle could give an 
ordinary flower a very out-of-the-ordinary look. 
</P>
<P>
This means you will be shooting your subject front-lit, back-lit and side-lit. 
You may want to bracket the exposure if you are shooting slide film to ensure a 
properly exposed slide. Negative or color print film gives you plenty of 
latitude, so bracketing isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
A single-lens reflex camera, or SLR, is a must for any serious close-up 
photography. Viewing directly through the lens lets you see exactly what will 
appear on your film. 
</P>
<P>
For ease of operation and general close-up work, a macro lens -- a lens that 
has the capability to focus close -- is the right choice for the nature 
photographer. Today, macro capability is built into many lenses, ranging in 
focal length from 55 to 200 millimeters. Even many zoom lens offer the feature. 
</P>
<P>
But there are alternatives to buying a new lens. 
</P>
<P>
Using close filters -- diopters -- is one way to bring your subject in close. 
They are single-element lenses that come in different magnification levels that 
you add to your lens. The advantages of a diopter are that they have a low cost 
and don't change the exposure. A diopter is also easy to take on and off and is 
easy to carry. The only drawback is that generally, the picture quality of a 
diopter is not as high as the lens you are using. 
</P>
<P>
Another option is an extension tube. This method adds distance between the lens 
and camera. One of the nice things about extension tubes is that they allow you 
to photograph close up but let you retain the high optical quality of your 
lens. Make sure the extension works with the metering system in your camera or 
you will have to compensate by increasing your exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Bellows, a series of baffles that allow you to vary the distance from camera to 
lens in fine increments usually incorporating a rail system, are the sign of a 
serious close-up photographer. There are a lot of drawbacks, but they are 
mostly inconveniences to the photographer. For example, you must use a tripod 
because the extra size makes it impossible to hand hold. In addition, most 
bellows will not connect with the through-the-lens metering system of your 
camera, and because of the added distance you may need a flash. 
</P>
<P>
Most people don't even consider using an electronic flash -- a strobe -- for 
shooting flowers. But a strobe can add the light to give you extra depth of 
field, sharpness or dramatic light. 
</P>
<P>
Since your flash will be so close to the subject, you won't need a very 
elaborate setup. A small flash will work, but you need to move your flash off 
the camera. Most camera manufacturers make an extension cord for this purpose. 
Try shooting with the flash just off the camera, to the side of your subject 
and from behind. This type of experimentation will produce a winner. 
</P>
<P>
If your camera reads exposures through the lens for a flash photograph, you're 
set. You may need to make some exposure tests because of the short distance to 
the subject. Use slide film to make the tests and keep careful records of your 
f-stops, flash setting and distances of both your camera to subject and flash 
to subject.
