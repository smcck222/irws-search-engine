L.A. RIVER: NEAT IDEA, BAD TIMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe one of these days the Los Angeles River will be liberated from the 
concrete coffin the Army Corps of Engineers poured it into in the 1930s. The 
idea of restoring long stretches of the river to its natural state and lining 
its banks with parks makes too much sense to resist forever. 
</P>
<P>
But with the state's schools, its sick and poor, its mentally ill and others 
pleading for money from budgets that already are bare, it's hard to justify a 
big planning bill now. Perhaps the $500,000 the Legislature seems poised to 
invest in the planning effort would not help many of them all that much. But it 
would do them more good than a project that even its most enthusiastic 
supporters talk of as something that will take a generation, or more, to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for a study under way of a plan to remodel the concrete riverbed 
to handle rush-hour traffic in some places and trucks in others. Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Los Angeles) could do the city a major favor by asking the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission to suspend study on his plan and the 
Assembly to put the river project on hold until there is a stronger whiff of 
municipal prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
One rather basic reason for holding things up for a while involves the Corps of 
Engineers. The corps turned 58 miles of the river into a flood channel 40 years 
ago and by mere right of possession would have something to say about its 
future. Apparently the corps has no quarrels with tearing up its handiwork -- 
at least north of downtown Los Angeles. It is not likely that with a military 
standoff in the Middle East and a deficit at $170 billion the federal 
government has money left over to finance the work it would take to form such 
an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case -- and it is hard to see how it could be otherwise -- 
nothing the state does could lead anywhere until the corps had money. 
</P>
<P>
The river has been there longer than Los Angeles, longer even than the Corps of 
Engineers. It is not going away. And none of the other plans for using the 
river is likely to beat out the idea of using it as an informal urban park 
while the planners mark time.

REP. STARK'S COMMENTS ABOUT LOUIS SULLIVAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regards to the remarks of Rep. Stark calling Sullivan "a disgrace to his 
position and to his race": 
</P>
<P>
As a physician, I am familiar with previous derogatory statements by Rep. 
Stark. 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite ways of referring to doctors is "those bastards." 
</P>
<P>
I submit that Rep. Stark is a real "hater" and that he truly despises anyone 
who fails to support his positions. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that he is furious that any black would not only disagree with him, 
but would dare to be a physician also.

EMERGENCY HELICOPTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Aug. 1 editorial, "Helicopters to Nowhere," cited some valid points. 
Purchase of a dedicated emergency response helicopter is not a panacea for an 
ailing Los Angeles County trauma network. 
</P>
<P>
However, a helicopter may be a desirable component of a well thought-out trauma 
response system. And therein lies the distinction. Such a helicopter would 
hardly solve the transportation problems in an area such as the Hollywood 
Hills. But in the San Gabriel Valley, which has been left bereft of trauma 
facility coverage since the withdrawal of Queen of the Valley and Whittier 
Presbyterian hospitals from the trauma network, such a transportation 
alternative could make the difference, in certain instances, between life and 
death or, with some patients, being able to make a full recovery and continued 
reliance on life-support therapy. 
</P>
<P>
We urge state lawmakers to recognize the crisis in health-care funding at the 
county level, and to adjust their priorities and act swiftly and responsibly to 
provide needed funding for health care.

REP. STARK'S COMMENTS ABOUT LOUIS SULLIVAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times has made the enlightened observation that otherwise "good" liberal 
Democrats can harbor traces of the racist thinking that they regularly decry 
("Stark's Idea Is Basically a Racist One," editorial, Aug. 4). Rep. Pete Stark 
(D-Oakland) showed us a glimpse of that hypocrisy when he suggested that Health 
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan should hold certain political views 
(i.e., Stark's) because of his race. The Times countered with the sensible and 
unchallengeable dictum that "the notion that skin color, religion, ethnic 
origin or sex obliges a person to hold particular ideas is as hurtful as any 
other racist idea." 
</P>
<P>
But could The Times be displaying some of that same hypocrisy? In the editorial 
immediately above the one about Stark The Times implies that Latino and black 
voters should hold certain corporate political views ("Only the Supervisors Had 
No Case"). 
</P>
<P>
The Times buys into the dangerous belief that Los Angeles County supervisorial 
districts are "discriminatory" because they "dilute" Latino voting strength. 
How can one speak of an ethnic group's "voting strength" without presuming that 
all members of that group share the same political views? Indeed, how can The 
Times (and others) speak of the need for a Latino supervisor without adopting 
the belief that a Latino supervisor (and only a Latino supervisor) will vote in 
a way acceptable to the "Latino community"? Such thinking leads to frightening 
conclusions, such as the necessity of only white elected officials in 
predominantly white districts. 
</P>
<P>
The case for redistricting on the basis of ethnicity rests atop the same swamp 
of insidious racism that has seeped into Stark's rhetoric. How can The Times 
possibly denounce one while endorsing the other? The Times (and everyone else) 
should try to reconcile these positions.

175 VOTES FOR 'BUTCHER OF BAGHDAD'; 
</P>
<P>
THE DEBATE ON CUTTING EXPORT CREDITS FOR IRAQ WAS A TEXTBOOK CASE OF CRASS 
POLITICS OVERRIDING MORAL PURPOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

County's 40th District. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although President Bush has acted with swift resolve since Iraq's dramatic 
invasion of Kuwait, America's message to Baghdad in the days and months 
preceding the attack was far more ambiguous. In fact, just six days before, 
Republicans and Democrats alike took the floor of Congress to oppose even the 
mildest sanctions against Iraq, which by that time had amassed 30,000 troops on 
its border with Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Hussein's outrages against human rights and his extraordinary military 
buildup, the United States has extended $500 million this year in credit 
guarantees for exports of agricultural commodities to Iraq. In 1989, the total 
was about $1 billion. Such taxpayer-subsidized loans are not even available to 
the Soviet Union, which has bought U.S. grain for years. 
</P>
<P>
It is well known that U.S. farm subsidy programs -- what Texas' Republican Rep. 
Dick Armey calls "OPEC for crops" -- are among the most wasteful boondoggles 
that Congress has contrived. 
</P>
<P>
When a farm-state Democrat, Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas, offered an amendment 
to this year's farm bill to take Iraq off the gravy train, the State Department 
opposed it; a subsidy cutoff, State said, "would not help us achieve U.S. goals 
with Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
That the State Department and many in Congress were more interested in 
maintaining this most blatant of domestic political payoffs than in ending U.S. 
taxpayer support for Iraq was telling evidence of the level of American concern 
with events there. The implicit message was surely not lost on the Butcher of 
Baghdad as he weighed whether to grab Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 91 Democrats and 84 Republicans voted against ending export credit 
subsidies to Iraq. And while the Glickman amendment passed, 234-175, the kind 
of tough, even Pattonesque rhetoric that is everywhere evident in the halls of 
Congress today was strangely absent from the debate on July 27. 
</P>
<P>
"Back before the Cuban Revolution," said Democrat Bill Alexander, "Arkansas was 
the single largest exporter of rice to Cuba. Over 30 years since the embargo 
was imposed by our country against selling rice to Cuba, it has cost my rice 
farmers $11.5 billion in uninflated dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"The embargo on Cuba has been a classic case of shooting ourselves in the 
foot," he concluded. "To do so once was folly. To do so a second time, with 
respect to Iraq, is near insanity." 
</P>
<P>
Insanity . . . Last week, the word was used to describe Saddam Hussein's state 
of mind. But the week before, it was to hell with human rights and national 
security -- there's money to be made. Indeed, in the very same floor speech in 
which he acknowledged that the Iraqi government was "despicable," Alexander put 
it this bluntly: "Here's why we shouldn't restrict agricultural trade with 
Iraq: We need the trade." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one might excuse a Bill Alexander for such crass opportunism, since he 
at least represents a farm district. But the farm lobby could not win 175 votes 
for subsidies to Iraq through its numbers alone. According to Bernal Green and 
Thomas Carlin, two economists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, only 46 
of the 435 congressional districts in America are farm-oriented. Like the labor 
unions, farm groups have used political organizing skills to amplify their 
power far beyond their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I found myself desperately lobbying representatives of large 
metropolitan areas during the floor vote on ending subsidies to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure from a rural constituency couldn't explain why Charles Rangel, the 
Democrat who represents Harlem, or Jim Bates, the Republican-turned-Democrat 
who represents San Diego's southside, voted to keep Hussein on the dole. A far 
better explanation is that most members of Congress, like the farm lobbyists 
themselves, are champion log-rollers. 
</P>
<P>
David R. Nagel, a Democrat from Iowa who voted to continue Hussein's subsidies, 
recently took the House floor to explain in detail how farm-state legislators 
had cut a deal with the maritime lobby: In return for farm support of a 
"ship-American" rule, Nagel said, the maritime interests agreed to support the 
farm program. 
</P>
<P>
And so it has gone, on and on, until now members of the House from every region 
of the country have become so caught up in voting for farm subsidies that even 
a madman like Saddam Hussein cannot break them of their habit. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, once American public opinion was enlightened about Hussein, the very 
same members of Congress who had pontificated about the evils of "using food as 
a weapon" immediately voted to cut off not only subsidies, but all trade with 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
None, however, was more unabashed in his instant reversal than Democrat Mervyn 
Dymally of Los Angeles. Taking the floor only five days after his vote to give 
subsidized loans to Hussein, Dymally "urgently requested" the President to 
"exert every effort, short of militaristic intervention," in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad fact that the substantial support for taxpayer-guaranteed loans to 
Saddam Hussein -- up to the very moment of his rape of Kuwait -- speaks volumes 
about the dominance of domestic political expediency over national security 
interests in Congress. After all, it is hardly as if the bipartisan votes for 
continued agriculture subsidies to Hussein were cast in ignorance of the threat 
that he poses to Mideast peace. 
</P>
<P>
Debate on the Glickman amendment only served to highlight that its opponents 
were well aware of Hussein's crimes. Missouri Republican Bill Emerson, who rose 
to oppose the subsidy cutoff, called Iraq "at this point in time the most 
abysmal government in the world." As if domestic murders and foreign aggression 
weren't enough, the debate even brought to light that Iraq has consistently 
cheated on the commodity loan program. 
</P>
<P>
In a floor speech on the day of the Iraqi invasion, Edward F. Feighan, a 
Democrat who represents suburban Cleveland, Ohio, catalogued Hussein's 
atrocities to date and his potential for more. Feighan spoke with such ringing 
passion, one couldn't have guessed that he'd voted to stock Hussein's larders 
just days before. 
</P>
<P>
So, through neglect and naive collaboration, America has found it now must pay 
a far higher price to stop Saddam Hussein than merely lost trade opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Burke, to whom is attributed the statement that "The only thing 
necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing," in fact said 
this: "When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one 
by one -- an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle." Now Hussein and 
his 1 million bad men are combined against us. The failure of good Republicans 
and Democrats alike to stand together when there was an opportunity to thwart 
him has all but ensured American sacrifices in a contemptible struggle.

PLANTING A 'BIG STICK' IN QUICKSAND; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. MILITARY MUSCLE FOUNDERS IN POLITICAL CURRENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY F. JACKSON, Henry F. Jackson, author of From the Congo to Soweto: U.S. 
Foreign Policy Toward Africa Since 1960 (Morrow, 1984), is visiting professor 
of political science and Afro-American studies at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gunboat diplomacy -- military intervention to secure a political goal -- 
enabled the United States to impose its will abroad in the first half of this 
century. Unfortunately for our foreign-policy stakes in many developing 
countries today, it continues to be the knee-jerk reaction at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The "big stick" approach, which largely ignored indigenous cultures and 
authorities from Santo Domingo to Saigon, collapsed finally with America's 
defeat in Vietnam. To persist in strong-arm showdowns after Vietnam was to 
forget its vital lesson: that military intervention, like the hand that slaps 
the tar baby, mires us in a political, economic and even cultural morass beyond 
Washington's ability to contain. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's audacious entry into the Middle East to thwart Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein is only the latest indication that our country has not 
learned to respond to Third World challenges without military action. 
</P>
<P>
The President, in rationalizing his decision to deploy U.S. troops in Saudi 
Arabia, asserted that "a line has been drawn in the sand." Evidently he is 
unaware that he is dealing with quicksand: engaging U.S. forces for an 
unlimited time in a militarily and culturally inhospitable climate, to support 
a medieval system in a country where thousands of college-educated people have 
been demanding representative democracy, and thus risking the monarchy's 
overthrow by a small but significant group of Islamic fundamentalists and the 
possible accession of a new, strongly anti-American government. The President's 
decision may succeed in stopping Saddam Hussein from invading the Saudi kingdom 
-- if indeed that ever was his objective. But the effect on Saudi domestic 
politics is likely to require a long-term U.S. presence to maintain, though 
precariously, the Saudi king on his throne. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has said he would welcome Hussein's removal. There is no 
evidence that Washington appreciates the long-term peril in attempting to 
remove a leader who, though reviled in the West, is widely admired in his world 
as the Bismarck of Arab-Muslim nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Our involvement will undoubtedly intensify the fierce anti-Americanism of the 
region's fundamentalists, who can be counted on to side with Hussein. Is the 
Bush Administration prepared to press its campaign against him at the risk of 
undermining America's other ally-monarchies in Jordan and the oil-rich United 
Arab Emirates? 
</P>
<P>
Only days before the intervention in the Middle East, President Bush dispatched 
200 Marines to Liberia, where Americans are said to be in danger in that 
country's intractable civil war. Notwithstanding multimillion-dollar U.S. 
assistance, the regime of President Samuel K. Doe is nearly comatose after 
seven months of guerrilla onslaughts mounted by two different factions that 
represent ethnic cleavages in Liberia as well as political antagonisms. Doe has 
been a cherished ally in the eyes of Washington policy-makers, and each of the 
warring factions poised to finish him off is in a position to draw U.S. forces 
into the line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Panama, proclaimed at the end of last year as the scene of triumphant U.S. 
interventionism, remains in a state of severe instability. The economy is at 
the brink of decay in large part because the aid Washington promised has not 
been forthcoming. Meanwhile, the maintenance of law and order and the 
protection of U.S. interests are still dependent on many of the same Panamanian 
forces that once bolstered Gen. Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Three interventions, in less than a year, on three continents. Each poses a 
different example of the limitations a mighty power faces in trying to shape 
the outcome of events in a small, developing country. Our European allies know 
the lesson well, and despite their support of an economic blockade of Iraq, 
they have refused to join the United States in sending soldiers to Saudi 
Arabia. Can it be that erstwhile European colonialists -- the French at 
Dienbienphu, the Belgians in the Congo, the Portuguese in Angola -- know Third 
World realities yet to dawn on Washington? 
</P>
<P>
There is a new generation of Third World leaders who, inspired by ideologies 
that sometimes demonize America, are willing to challenge American supremacy. 
These leaders, from Saddam Hussein to Fidel Castro, and their political 
cultures must become the content of new thinking that will shift U.S. policy 
from interventionism to negotiations and economic influence. These would be 
avenues to success in the Third World, rather than fiasco.

A DEGRADATION OF AMERICAN LIBERALISM; 
</P>
<P>
ACTORS' EQUITY'S DECISION TO DENY A ROLE TO A BRITISH ACTOR WAS PURE, VILE 
RACISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George Will writes a syndicated column in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how low your expectations for contemporary liberalism start, or how 
fast and far you lower them, there is no keeping up with the degradation of 
that dogma, as in the scandal of "Miss Saigon." The infrequency and inadequacy 
of liberal thinking is now threatening to take a new toll, by darkening the 
Broadway theater in which "Miss Saigon" was to open next March. 
</P>
<P>
That musical has thrilled audiences in London's West End. But in an act of real 
moral heroism, the producer has announced cancellation of the Broadway run 
rather than tolerate the liberal racism of an American union, Actors' Equity, 
which wants to dictate the racial composition of the cast -- in one crucial 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Saigon" is set in Saigon in the waning hours of the Vietnam War. The lead 
part portrays a pimp of Eurasian parents -- French and Vietnamese. Last week, 
the exquisitely misnamed Actors' Equity voted to deny Jonathan Pryce, who 
played the lead in London, the right to play it in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Pryce is that he is not Asian. Of course neither is the 
character he plays. But the tender conscience of Actors' Equity will not let it 
"appear to condone the casting of a Caucasian" in the role of someone half 
Caucasian and half Asian. This denial of artistic freedom means that Pryce will 
be denied a temporary work visa. Remember when liberalism had something to do 
with liberty? When liberals were strong for freedom to travel and against visa 
denials? 
</P>
<P>
If the union sticks to what it calls its "moral position" -- it is wobbling -- 
the cost will include: a record $25 million advance ticket sale, 50 acting jobs 
(34 of them minorities, most of them Asians -- isn't liberal compassion 
lovely?), 129 jobs for musicians, stagehands and others, and a payroll of 
$200,000 a week. Some union. 
</P>
<P>
The union's weasely position is the usual one of liberals running a racial 
spoils system. It says color-blind hiring is the correct principle, but in 
today's climate of racism, etc., and given the legacy of racism, etc., we 
cannot adhere to the correct principle until tomorrow. And tomorrow is always a 
day away. 
</P>
<P>
With the pathetic earnestness of the ideologically blinkered, the union 
justifies its decision by citing a clause in the production contract affirming 
a "policy of nondiscrimination." Such demented thinking results when language 
is reduced to applesauce. That has been done by dressing up reverse 
discrimination as "affirmative action." 
</P>
<P>
When Supreme Court Justice William Brennan resigned, there was much celebration 
of his "legacy." The "Miss Saigon" scandal is part of it. He is particularly 
responsible for giving a constitutional imprimatur to the poison of 
"progressive" racism seeping through America's system. 
</P>
<P>
People like the leaders of Actors' Equity, having been tutored into inanity by 
liberal jurisprudence, are too confused to have even an uneasy conscience when 
they say they are too gosh-darned moral to "give away" Pryce's role to Pryce, 
who created the role, artistically. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rich, the New York Times theater critic, says Pryce's "brilliant" 
performance "is as essential to 'Miss Saigon' as Joel Gray's was to 'Cabaret'." 
But the union is nothing if not armed with the buzzwords of today's 
righteousness. It says that if Pryce were given permission to play the role, 
"the Asian community" would consider it a "racial slur." 
</P>
<P>
Remember Yul Brynner playing the King of Siam in "The King and I." Laurence 
Olivier playing Othello? Actors' Equity is now too moral to tolerate such 
casting. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Freeman, the black actor who starred in the films "Glory" and "Driving 
Miss Daisy," recently played Petruchio in "The Taming of the Shrew." Denzel 
Washington, another black star of "Glory," is now playing the title role in 
"Richard III." 
</P>
<P>
Actors' Equity has attacked the cardinal principle of theatrical ethics, the 
categorical obligation to present the best possible performance. It also has 
shown itself oblivious to the magic of theater, where actors, by their language 
and presence, entice the audience's imagination. This is the supreme artistic 
as well as moral importance of "non-traditional casting" that casts a gifted 
black man as an English king. 
</P>
<P>
Remember this name: Cameron Mackintosh. He is the British producer who, by 
standing up for artistic freedom and against today's trendy racism, told some 
American liberals that he will not be party to their traducing of this American 
(and, long ago, liberal) principle: It is wicked to allocate opportunity on the 
basis of race.

SAFE LANDING FOR GIBSON PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man Vanity Fair called "the very model of a modern motion-picture star," 
Mel Gibson, was the center of a female squeal-fest Thursday night, when 
Tri-Star Pictures launched its new film, "Air America." 
</P>
<P>
It was a splashy old-fashioned opening: a screening at Mann's Chinese Theater, 
a block-long red carpet down the middle of the street (taped to the asphalt), 
and a gala party on the roof of the parking structure of the nearby Holiday 
Inn. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was a benefit for the American Film Institute (in association with 
Tri-Star and Carolco Pictures), and the event planners did a great job 
transforming the concrete platform into a fair replica of Adventureland, with 
taped bird calls, tropical plants and the sounds of planes strafing overhead. 
Ambrosia catered a lavish buffet of Thai-American-style food, complete with 
urns of cold Thai iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the Teahouse-of-the-August-Moon effect, a prop plane with a 30-foot 
wingspan stretched over the party, spitting smoke. Another plane, constructed 
entirely of chocolate, hung over the dessert bar like a Spruce Goose designed 
by Hershey. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson created havoc among the camera-toting tourists when he walked to the 
party, and even the normally blase premiere types lost their cool when he posed 
for a photo opportunity. As soon as the last flashbulb popped, Gibson and 
co-star Robert Downey Jr. were rushed by autograph-seekers (many of whom seemed 
to come from within the industry). 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I suppose I could be persuaded," said AFI director Jean Firstenberg, when 
asked to pose with Gibson. She added, "Bette Davis did a seminar at the AFI in 
January of 1983, and she lamented the lack of real stars in Hollywood today. 
She said, 'There's one gentleman who just might make it, and his name is Mel 
Gibson.' And that was back in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand: "America's" co-stars David Marshall Grant, Marshall Bell and Tim 
Thomerson; as well as Ernest and Tova Borgnine, Freddie and Corinna Fields, 
Chuck and Ava Fries, Sherry Lansing, Ken Kragen and Cathy Worthington, Lorna 
Luft, Karl Malden, Ed McMahon, Donna Mills, Sarah Jessica Parker, Bob Rafelson, 
Suzanne Somers, Ken Wahl, Edgar Winter (in a wicked-cool purple jacket) and 
Robert Wise. 
</P>
<P>
There was dancing to taped Madonna and M.C. Hammer songs; schmoozing to Aretha 
Franklin and the Commodores, and there were gift bags of "Air America" 
T-shirts, perfumes and something called "Redken Creatif Centigrade Therm-active 
Bodifier 4L." The hotel guests, however, had the best celebrity-watching posts, 
hanging out of their windows to watch the festivities. They got a great view of 
the proceedings without having to set foot on Hollywood Boulevard, which looks 
more and more like "Blade Runner" with each passing evening. (Perhaps the 
midnight denizens down there could use a spritz of Redken Creatif Centigrade 
Therm-active Bodifier 4L.)

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: FOOT THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My boyfriend is trying to persuade me that foot massage not only 
feels good, but also has health benefits. Is there any medical basis for what 
he says, or is he just giving me a line? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Foot massage helps improve circulation and relieve tension. In fact, 
some people maintain that, when properly done, it helps relax the entire body. 
</P>
<P>
A byproduct of foot massage is that it provides an opportunity for checking the 
feet, and for making certain that minor conditions are treated appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When an older child is not feeling well, he can at least tell you what's 
bothering him. But since a baby can't talk, the problem is very different and 
can become quite frustrating. My daughter has an infant who was very cranky for 
a long period of time, until finally it was found that he had an ear infection. 
Isn't there any way to determine if a very young child has an ear infection 
without having to go through as much aggravation? 
</P>
<P>
A: Infants who have an ear infection, as you have learned, may be irritable and 
have trouble sleeping. More specifically, they may tend to pull at the ear. The 
possibility of an ear infection in the face of such behavior becomes more 
likely if the child recently had a cold.

WATTS RIOTS SURFACE IN TNT'S 'HEAT WAVE'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: TONIGHT'S TWO-HOUR CABLE DRAMA LOOKS AT THE ERUPTION IN 1965 
THROUGH THE EYES OF AN ACCIDENTAL REPORTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EPSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strange name, "Heat Wave," for the strange fruit that fell that summer in 1965 
when Watts burned. But then the title of Turner Network Television's two-hour 
drama tonight is just surface. How much is beyond that surface is another 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
This is an ambitious enterprise for the Turner people, retelling the story of a 
young Los Angeles man who became an instant reporter-trainee 25 years ago for 
The Times because he was black, because he knew Watts and because, for better 
or worse, he was in the right place in the most fearful of times. 
</P>
<P>
The enterprise is also ambitious in presentation: Four times today and tonight, 
"Heat Wave," starring Blair Underwood, Cicely Tyson, James Earl Jones, Sally 
Kirkland and Margaret Avery, will be shown over TNT in falling-duck prime-time 
fashion: 5 p.m., 7 p.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Take your choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Heat Wave's" story is simple enough if not weighted down with predictable 
chance meetings, chilling confrontations, bad bad guys, good good guys and, of 
course, the inevitable, dramatic death-in-the-street scenes. 
</P>
<P>
In Michael Lazarou's retelling of Robert Richardson's story -- Richardson was 
the young Times messenger who wondrously knew key editorial people when Watts 
erupted and subsequently became a reporter-trainee as fires swept the streets 
-- we get snatches of the black Los Angeles experience: '60s-type 
discrimination as a black father can't find construction work, but janitor jobs 
are plentiful. A high school student is told to aim his ambitions low. For 
mature women, domestic servitude with stereotypical white folks. Young black 
boys chased from the tracks along Alameda by crew-cut whites from Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first hour of the presentation, a sort of primer on prejudice in 
the Golden State. Then the all-too-familiar occurs: oppressive August heat 
(remember, this retelling of Watts is titled "Heat Wave"), two young men 
drinking and driving, a cautious CHP motorcycle officer, a strong-willed 
mother. Then the explosion in the streets that raged too deeply, too long and 
too tellingly. The heat wave turned into a social tidal wave. 
</P>
<P>
There are rare incisive, insightful moments in the 120 minutes that attempt to 
re-experience the seven days of destruction that were Aug. 11 to 17, 1965. Only 
two stay in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
One is the strange Impressionist image of Cicely Tyson as the matriarchal 
domestic. She stands alone on a Sunset bus stop in front of the Beverly Hills 
Hotel, carrying her bag of possessions. An empty taxi passes her. She waits 
patiently, hopefully for a ride, for a bus, for another taxi. Moments before, 
she had fled the white couple for whom she had worked for more than 10 years in 
quiet anger after the frightened, gun-buying husband had termed Watts residents 
savages. The picture cuts to cars being overturned. Police flailing at looters. 
We see the older woman again. She waits, gripping her bag. There will be a bus 
home. Then the fires burn harder, a clothing store explodes. She waits. Then, 
so very late, the bus fills the screen and she is gone. She has waited so very 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The other telling image: Street reporter Richardson puts a tape recorder in 
front of an angry Watts man and urges him to describe his feelings as if he 
were talking to people beyond Watts. "You are hurting me," he says with 
anger/terror/passion, "and I want you to stop it right now." 
</P>
<P>
You are hurting me. 
</P>
<P>
The reviewer remembers another young black trainee at another Los Angeles 
newspaper as the fires of Watts sent explanation marks of smoke and panic into 
the air. "I live there and for the first time I'm afraid of what is happening 
to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
What has happened? Where is the hurt 25 years later? The Avnet-Kerner 
production, directed by Kevin Hooks, supplies only some footnotes. The tough 
stuff stays in our hearts.

<P>
AN AUSTRALIAN 'SUITE EN BLANC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Serge Lifar dominated French ballet for most of this century, he is 
virtually unknown in America -- except, perhaps, as the dancer for whom George 
Balanchine created "Apollo" and "Prodigal Son." As a result, the Australian 
Ballet production of Lifar's 1943 "Suite en Blanc" comes as a revelation: 
authentic, vintage neoclassicism completely different from the celebrated 
achievements in that idiom by Balanchine and Frederick Ashton. 
</P>
<P>
Seen on an otherwise familiar three-part program Saturday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, "Suite en Blanc" enlists 45 minutes of the score that 
Edouard Lalo composed for "Namouna" in 1881 -- music of great formal elegance 
but also tingling with atmosphere and sensuality. Although three women appear 
in Romantic tutus, the ballet honors Russian-style classicism at its most 
brilliant and imposing, beginning and ending with 35 dancers arranged 
architecturally on two floor levels and adjoining staircases. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Lifar's solos, duets and trios are both amplified and ornamented by 
inventive corps patterns (often using groups of eight). If his steps emphasize 
academic technical display, the unusual, custom-tailored torso twists and 
gestural motifs encourage you to see the classical vocabulary in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Miranda Coney's hands behind her head and, later, behind her back 
in the pas de trois -- or Anna de Cardi touching her shoulders during 
balances-in-extension in the "Serenade" solo -- look strangely intimate. But 
that's Lifar's intention: to personalize this grand-scale, tutu-and-tiara 
divertissement and keep it rich in feeling. So he keeps splitting the focus 
between the individual and the group, the abstract and the emotional. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, most of the eight Australian Ballet principals at the matinee 
proved overtaxed by Lifar's technical demands, with only Coney in the 
"Variation de la Cigarette" and Lisa Pavane in the "Variation de la Flute" 
ideally accurate and stylish. A nice try, but definitely no triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program: Jiri Kylian's intense "Return to the Strange Land" 
(1975) and David Lichine's effervescent "Graduation Ball" (1940), ballets well 
known to local audiences from productions by (respectively) the Joffrey Ballet 
and American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Set to piano music by Leos Janacek, "Strange Land" explored turbulent and 
intricate partnering relationships through a vocabulary at once balletic and 
gymnastic. 
</P>
<P>
Led by the powerful Greg Horsman and the meticulous Pavane, the statuesque 
Ulrike Lytton and the sinewy Steven Heathcote, the matinee Australians 
magnificently overcame the work's most daunting physical hazards, but without 
quite embodying the tension and weight that makes Kylian look like Kylian. 
Nigel Gaynor played the score sensitively. 
</P>
<P>
"Graduation Ball" also looked distorted stylistically -- too broad and smirky 
-- though the reassembled Johann Strauss music sounded tolerably fresh and the 
Geoffrey Guy designs (based on Benois) enforced the appropriate sense of period 
stagecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Lichine's depiction of a party at a Viennese girl's school adroitly balanced 
nostalgic charm and dance excitement, though the best choreography was assigned 
to people with no real place in the story. Thus Pavane and the noble David 
Ashmole functioned as guest stars in their polished neo-Romantic adagio, while 
allegro virtuosity belonged to Coney, Rachel Broomham (competition dancers) and 
Steven Woodgate (drummer). 
</P>
<P>
Far less compelling caractere high jinks remained for the nominal leads: Fiona 
Tonkin and Elizabeth Toohey as young girls, Colin Peasley and Roy Wilson as 
their decrepit chaperons. Ormsby Wilkins conducted both "Graduation Ball" and 
"Suite en Blanc" propulsively.

TALENTS STRETCH GENRE AT LONG BEACH FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tone Loc's got nothing to worry about. At least not from trombonist Wayne 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
In his show-closing set Saturday at the Long Beach Jazz Festival -- held next 
to the Rainbow Lagoon near the Long Beach Convention Center -- Henderson, the 
former Crusader and leader here of a slightly over-hyped group of musicians 
dubbed "Master Collection," rapped his way through a new tune entitled "Just 
Because It's Jazz Don't Mean You Can't Dance." Though the husky-voiced 
Henderson's delivery was less than prime, a good part of the crowd, generously 
estimated by festival personnel at 9,000, took the lyric to heart, moving into 
the aisles and in front of the stage to shimmy and shake. 
</P>
<P>
The tune made an appropriate theme song for the 3-day event that opened Friday 
night with keyboardist Bobby Lyle, message-conscious vocalist Gil Scott-Heron 
and pop singer Phyllis Hyman, and continued Sunday in a more traditional vein 
with a scheduled program that included cornetist Nat Adderley, pianist McCoy 
Tyner and Latin-jazz-band leader Poncho Sanchez. But, on Saturday, just because 
you heard it at the jazz festival didn't necessarily make it jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Perspective on the label-stretching fest came early-on from singer Dakota 
Staton, who delivered a vivacious set of standards and blues backed by the 
competent trio of pianist Bross Townsend, bassist Isla Eckinger and drummer 
Jack Ranelli. The singer -- who made the pop charts a number of times in the 
late '50s -- showed strength and conviction while utilizing a minimum of 
stylistic gimmicks in her renditions of such familiar numbers as "Misty," "The 
Thrill Is Gone" and "Love for Sale," on which she injected vocal octave jumps 
in a way that recalled the late Billy Holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between Staton and Henderson was a mixed-bag of pop, funk and 
fusion. Vibist Roy Ayers, who now plays a compact, electronic version of the 
instrument, gave an uneven, backbeat-laden performance (with bass supplied by a 
keyboard) that contained too much of Ayers' vocal antics and too little of his 
mallet work. The Rippingtons, featuring guitarist Russ Freeman, enlivened their 
mostly bland compositions with Steve Reid's percussion embellishments and Mark 
Portman's synthesizer wash. 
</P>
<P>
A satisfying set from pianist Ramsey Lewis was marred by a loss of sound during 
a dramatic guitar solo from quintet member Henry Johnson and by the explosions 
of the nightly fireworks launched from the nearby Queen Mary. Lewis' funky 
block-chord style remains intact, and the keyboardist worked some ambitious Art 
Tatum-style flourishes as well into Stevie Wonder's "Living for the City." And, 
yes, the keyboardist did "Wade in the Water." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Henderson's attempt at rap, the Master Collection's short 
R&amp;B-infused closing set was solid in a way that recalled its leader's days 
in the old Jazz Crusaders. Central to this success was Alphonse Mouzon's crisp, 
inventive drumming, Kirk Whalum's blowzy tenor sax work and Henderson's own 
burnished trombone tones. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing Saturday were saxophonist Hank Crawford and the Yellowjackets 
(reviewed last Monday.

SOMETHING EXTRA WITH RODGERS &amp; HAMMERSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Normally Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Night at Hollywood Bowl is a signal for 
everyone to go on automatic pilot, as the Los Angeles Philharmonic listlessly 
cranks out the big tunes for the Los Angeles Master Chorale. But this year's 
edition reached for something extra -- no Master Chorale, a pops conductor 
(Erich Kunzel) who knows and apparently enjoys his business, and two bona-fide 
Broadway belters, Mandy Patinkin and Barbara Cook. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a mostly idiomatic, sometimes eccentric Richard Rodgers concert, 
with some side trips into Harold Arlen, Stephen Sondheim, Harry Warren and 
other American melodists. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the eccentricity was provided by Patinkin, who, in his Bowl debut, 
hustled on stage in a black T-shirt, baggy black pants and sneakers, looking as 
if he was going to clean out his garage. Somewhere along the line, this hugely 
gifted singer/actor has developed a bad case of histrionics -- yelping, 
shrieking, overacting, overemoting, going over the top even in "Over the 
Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Patinkin thought he had to ham it up before such a large audience, 
reportedly 16,243 strong on Friday (and 17,913 on Saturday). Yet only when he 
brought himself under control ("Younger Than Springtime," "Bein' Green") did he 
remind us of the Patinkin who was so emotionally affecting in "Sunday in the 
Park With George" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Cook could teach Patinkin a few things about dramatic and dynamic 
control, interpreting "Mister Snow" and "A Wonderful Guy" beautifully, giving 
Sondheim's "Losing My Mind" the right amount of urbane longing. At the close, 
she and Patinkin ventured "Getting to Know You" and "People Will Say We're in 
Love" together, marred only by some silly Patinkin scatting in the former. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Kunzel and the solid-sounding Philharmonic prefaced each half of the 
program with an agreeable mix of Rodgers tunes, as if to whet the appetite.

CROWD'S FIRED UP BUT PLANT'S LUKEWARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Plant's show practically burned down the house Friday night at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre, but it also stunk up the joint. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was Plant's fans who did the burning and stinking. Taking a 
familiar arena-rock act of homage to extremes, thousands of them set beer and 
soda cups aflame and held them aloft. Forget flick-your-Bic. This was 
light-your-torch. 
</P>
<P>
In the 22 years since his start with Led Zeppelin, Plant presumably has seen 
just about everything that a rock audience's huddled masses can come up with. 
But this left him agape. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow, look at that," the 41-year-old Englishman said, pausing after "Ship of 
Fools," the ballad that touched off the pyromania. Later, stopping again to 
scan the impressive field of burning cups, he pronounced the sight "beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The melting material from the cups smelled like incinerator spew, no doubt 
highly carcinogenic. For a while, mass asphyxiation seemed a possibility. 
Luckily, the ammo was spent by the start of Plant's second encore. Fun's fun, 
folks, but let's not make this a habit, OK? 
</P>
<P>
Plant's show was full of other memorably strange and wacky occurrences that 
made the evening more than your usual hard rocker's night out. (At one point, 
somebody presented Plant with a lemon, an unsuccessful effort to get him to 
sing a Led Zep oldie, "The Lemon Song," giving the singer occasion to display 
some likable wit.) 
</P>
<P>
Musically, the nearly two-hour show ranged from dull and diffuse during the 
first half to appealingly folkish during a mid-set acoustic segment, to flaming 
-- figuratively speaking -- during a splendid show-closing pair of 
rockabilly-tinged rockers: Zep's "Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)" and 
Plant's solo hit "Tall Cool One." 
</P>
<P>
For one of rock's supposed titans, Plant's presence as a performer was 
surprisingly unremarkable. He was energetic enough, with his characteristic 
spins, struts, cross-legged steps and dramatic, hands-aloft pose-striking 
framed by all manner of stage fog and backlighting. 
</P>
<P>
But visuals alone don't make a singer commanding. The performers who fix our 
attention are the ones with something truly vivid to say. Plant has devoted his 
career to heroic gestures and inflated myth-weaving, but his songs during and 
after Led Zeppelin have seldom packed involving meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his show, Plant's myths and mysteries became shrouded in a musical fog 
of gauzelike keyboard textures and elongated, meandering arrangements. Plant 
found a focus by simplifying things. "Liar's Dance" featured nothing but his 
dramatic vocal and Doug Boyle's spare, tense acoustic guitar. He followed it 
with "Going to California," keeping the accompaniment acoustic while 
introducing a wistful, dreamy tone. 
</P>
<P>
The show gathered force from there, although it was only during the 
hard-charging encores that Plant and his band of capable, versatile, though not 
really distinctive players achieved what the title of his most recent album 
promises: manic nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
Opening singer Alannah Myles displayed a mighty blues-soaked vocal style and a 
frolicsome stage manner brimming with sly, mischievous sexuality. Myles did a 
fine job occupying the middle ground between Bonnie Raitt's rootsy authenticity 
and Pat Benatar's mainstream arena-rock style.

COUNTERPUNCH: THE FALLOUT OVER 'MISS SAIGON'; 
</P>
<P>
'I'M ASHAMED OF MY UNION, ACTORS' EQUITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLTON HESTON, Heston, a former president of the Screen Actors Guild, 
received an Oscar in 1959 for the title role in Ben-Hur. His career as a stage, 
television and film actor and director spans four decades. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actors may be the oldest minority group in the world. Thousands of years ago, 
when blacks still roved innocent in the African rain forests and Jews reigned 
remote in their desert redoubts, actors were wandering around Europe juggling 
apples, telling stories and doing the three walnut shells and a pea scam. We 
slept in stables before Christ was born, often with local company that got us 
run out of town by dogs the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
This has earned us an enduring reputation; to this day there are hotels actors 
can't stay in, clubs we can't join. Oddly, we don't seem to care too much about 
it. Remember Groucho Marx? "I wouldn't belong to a club that'd have me." 
</P>
<P>
Early in my career (during the Civil War, I recall), I was hired as leading man 
in a very successful stock company in Pennsylvania. The director explained to 
me that there was a street in the town the actors weren't supposed to cross and 
a part of the beach we couldn't swim from . . . did this bother me? "I didn't 
come here to swim," I said. "What are the parts?" 
</P>
<P>
I can't believe that the first union I joined, to which I'm proud to belong, 
could endorse so blatantly racist a position as Actors' Equity has done in 
denying Jonathan Pryce the right to play the role he created in "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
As actor and director, I've always assumed the idea was to get the best actor 
for the part, no matter what color he or she was. I've never spoken to a single 
working actor who didn't endorse this. When I took "The Caine Mutiny 
Court-Martial" to London four years ago, we forged an agreement with British 
Equity that let me use an almost all-American cast, because they were right for 
the parts! Where have we fallen from there? 
</P>
<P>
Now, Morgan Freeman can contribute an extraordinary Petruchio to "Taming of the 
Shrew," but Laurence Olivier would be prohibited from giving us his Othello, 
widely regarded as the best performance by any actor in any part in this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Dustin Hoffman has given the theater a memorable Shylock, can only 
Jewish actors be cast in the role? Because Sean Connery and I are Scots, are we 
the only actors who get to play Macbeth? What obscene drivel are we talking 
about here? Certainly not about acting. 
</P>
<P>
I'm ashamed of my union. I beg our leaders to abandon this bare-faced racist 
deception. Do you remember when you played checkers with your granddad, the 
first time you figured out that he was letting you win? And how mad it made 
you? That's what's happening here. We can't have this. 
</P>
<P>
We also can't have any cosmetic compromise: "Ohh . . . all right, Pryce can 
play the part . . . but only for 50 performances. OK!! A hundred, then . . . 
but that's it!" 
</P>
<P>
Equity has to get out of the casting business.

Matisse Battle Ends: The great-granddaughter of photographer Edward Steichen 
has won back a Matisse painting valued at $800,000 after a legal battle with 
the Museum of Modern Art. But 6-year-old Ariana Rodina Calderone Stahmer 
probably will never see the painting in her home because it will be sold to 
cover more than $100,000 in legal bills her family has to pay, the New York 
Times reported in Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the museum settled out of court on Friday, but terms of 
the arrangement in federal court in Bridgeport, Conn., were not made public. 
Henri Matisse presented Edward Steichen with the painting, "Vue de Collioure a 
l'Eglise," in 1908 to thank him for helping arrange the first American 
exhibition of his works and to commemorate the birth of Steichen's daughter, 
Kate. Steichen gave Kate Steichen the painting on her 53rd birthday, and she in 
turn loaned it to the museum in 1973, the year her father died. She died in 
1988, and the museum and the family have argued over the painting ever since. 
The museum said that Kate Steichen donated the painting to the museum; the 
family said that she had bequeathed the painting to her grandniece, Ariana, who 
lives in Pennington, N.J. GREG BRAXTON

Bring on Van Cliburn: Piano virtuoso Van Cliburn will give his first 
full-length solo recital in more than a decade this October in Kilgore, Tex., 
his boyhood home. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the recital will benefit the Harvey Lavan and Rildia Bee O'Bryan 
Cliburn Scholarship, named for Cliburn's parents, at Kilgore Junior College. 
Cliburn, 56, revived his performing career at the White House in December, 
1987, and has played selections from his solo repertoire at private 
fund-raising events and as encores for his orchestral appearances, but the 
Kilgore event will be his first complete solo recital since 1978. Cliburn also 
will perform this season with the Lincoln, Neb., Symphony on Sept. 21. GREG

ANNA DE CARDI IN 'GISELLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking exactly like the young Mitzi Gaynor, tiny Anna de Cardi made an 
unusually childlike and vivacious Giselle in the final Australian Ballet 
performance of the Romantic classic at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Recently promoted to senior artist -- the second-highest rank in the Australian 
Ballet hierarchy -- De Cardi had lost her usual Albrecht to injury and was 
dancing "Giselle" opposite David Ashmole (previously reviewed) for the first 
time on the company's North American tour. 
</P>
<P>
However, their partnership betrayed no hint of insecurity and, indeed, Ashmole 
muted De Cardi's tendency to chop the flowing adagio passages of the last act 
into allegro tasks divided by pauses. 
</P>
<P>
Except for this emphasis on speed and sharpness, De Cardi danced the role 
persuasively, and her acting had both warmth and spontaneity to recommend it. 
Especially artful: the idea of Giselle losing control of her dancing in the Mad 
Scene and being propelled toward her doom. Obviously, the living Giselle suits 
De Cardi better right now than moonstruck Wilidom, but she's only in her early 
20s, so there's plenty of time to explore the glories beyond the grave. The 
promise is there. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from De Cardi, the Friday "Giselle" and "Catalyst" (the curtain raiser) 
reunited principals familiar from earlier performances. John Lanchbery again 
conducted. LEWIS SEGAL

Stripped down to their underwear and standing knee-deep in algae-covered water, 
a dozen men hurriedly bathed and washed their laundry before "the oil and 
chemicals" turned the swiftly moving current of a downtown stretch of the Los 
Angeles River an iridescent blue. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, ribbons of bluish film began swirling around the legs of 
the men, most of whom waded out of the water and onto concrete banks strewn 
with rotting garbage and broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
"The chemicals don't bother me," said a 26-year-old unemployed carpenter from 
Juarez, Mexico, rinsing suds from his hair with water scooped from the river 
with a rusty can. "I use soap." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a mile from the heart of one of the world's most affluent cities, 
undocumented immigrants spend their days in conditions that rival the poorest 
of those in the Third World nations they left behind. On a river bank often 
heaped with junk and garbage, an estimated 150 day laborers bathe, cook, camp, 
wash clothes and defecate in treated waste water occasionally polluted with 
chemicals illegally dumped in storm drains and gutters that empty into the 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
The river people of Los Angeles say the concrete-lined flood-control channel is 
a quiet refuge from Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities, police 
and the spontaneous violence of downtown Skid Row streets. 
</P>
<P>
With little money and no Social Security numbers, proof of residence or birth 
certificates, these men and women from Mexico and Central America find few 
public services available to them. So they gravitate to the river in search of 
people who speak the same language and are willing to share some beans and 
tortillas and whatever else they have cooked by the river's edge. 
</P>
<P>
"For these immigrants, the Los Angeles River has become the village well," said 
Alice Callaghan, director of a Skid Row homeless agency, Las Familias del 
Pueblo. "It is a place where 150 immigrants a day share friendship, food, news 
from their homelands and information about jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials, homeless advocates and custodians of the river, including 
railroad police, the Army Corps of Engineers and the county Flood Control 
District, say the number of river people is increasing. That has raised fears 
about the health and safety of those who live in a place never intended for 
human habitation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do something to stop this," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate 
deputy director of the county disease-control programs. "These people are 
deluding themselves into thinking this is a healthy, safe place to live, but 
they are not thinking about the impact they may have on other people." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the water in the Los Angeles River is harmless, treated waste 
water, more than 60,000 gutter catch basins in the city and thousands more 
across the county also funnel pollutants into the stream ranging from motor oil 
to insecticides. Late each afternoon, the bluish chemical stream makes its 
appearance -- its exact source unknown by the river people or those who oversee 
the flood-control channel. 
</P>
<P>
It is an environment fraught with risk, Fannin said. "They do not stay on the 
river; they go out to day jobs and come in contact with other people," she 
said. "Why do you think Third World countries have tremendous disease levels? 
Because they do not understand the connection between defecating in the water 
and everybody there getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan suggests that it be viewed another way: "We deny people health care 
and decent living conditions, then we are aghast when they pick up diseases and 
bring them to us." 
</P>
<P>
Transients have visited the river for years, but it is only in recent months 
that authorities have become aware of its widespread use by homeless 
immigrants. Keeping them out is all but impossible because the channel is 
guarded only by chain-link fence, guardrails and occasional security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Although some have created makeshift shelters along the flood-control channel, 
most who use the riverbed say they sleep in the rescue missions, service 
centers and streets of downtown Skid Row, which is home to an estimated 11,000 
men and women. There are at least 35,000 long-term homeless people throughout 
Los Angeles, studies have shown. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Neely, a spokesman for the Homeless Outreach Program of Los Angeles, said 
that these immigrants migrate to the river because they "have found that they 
are not welcome in town." 
</P>
<P>
"If you've left your native society for another one that doesn't embrace you -- 
that in fact kicks you," Neely said, "the only thing you can do is find others 
just like you with whom you can share your hope and misery." 
</P>
<P>
He could have been talking about Jose, a 33-year-old former government worker 
from El Salvador who arrived here last May. His goal is to find a job and an 
apartment and send for his wife and four children. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, he spent the day crouched beneath a bridge on the Los Angeles 
River with two unemployed Mexican immigrants -- all of them waiting for their 
hand-scrubbed clothes to dry in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed to tell my family I'm down here. . . . I tell them I'm sick 
and haven't been able to find a job in three months," he said, clutching a 
brown paper sack containing a stale burrito offered by one of his river 
comrades. "It hurts being here." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Sato, supervising attorney of the environmental protection division of 
the city attorney's office, said his major concern for the people using the 
river is the dumping of hazardous wastes and unpredictable flooding that occurs 
during rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
"We receive a lot of complaints from people who have seen, heard or smelled 
things in there," Sato said. "Unless you catch (illegal dumpers) in the act, 
and catch samples before they are diluted in the river, it is difficult to 
prosecute them." 
</P>
<P>
The county Flood Control District analyzes the composition of the water once a 
month at five stations between the San Fernando Valley and Long Beach. But 
county officials contend that it is all but impossible to trace the source of 
potentially toxic substances that occasionally run down the river. 
</P>
<P>
"The water is variable from minute to minute," said Don Nichols, an assistant 
deputy director with the county Flood Control District. "People tend to wash 
things down those catch basins that probably shouldn't go down them. 
</P>
<P>
"We find anything that will fit down a storm drain system down there -- from 
dead bodies to countless types of chemicals. . . . It doesn't happen every day, 
but sooner or later it all shows up." 
</P>
<P>
None of that seems to have deterred Jose Sanchez, 22. 
</P>
<P>
"At about 4 or 5 o'clock every day, oil and chemicals come down the river," 
said Sanchez, a day laborer who has been living under a downtown river bridge 
for two months. "We don't bathe in it when the chemicals come." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez and his five companions live on wooden pallets and mattresses in a 
trash-strewn alcove of the bridge. He sleeps on a fold-up bed perched on a 
10-foot-wide bridge support about 50 feet above the concrete river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"The life I left in Mexico was no better than this," Sanchez said, running a 
hand through a head of hair speckled with white paint picked up at a recent day 
job. "What you see here is the life of immigrants who have been in this country 
only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, we are all united because we are all Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred yards away, four men fried chopped steak, carrots and onions over 
a fire fueled with cardboard and pieces of wood. Their "grill" was a rusty 
metal coil. 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast, they planned to disperse to street corners across the city 
where they hoped to be hired by employers needing day laborers at construction 
sites. At nightfall, they would regroup on the river, one of them said, to 
"talk about how the day went, who found work and how we can get work too." 
</P>
<P>
"Here, nobody gets arrested, beat up; nobody sells drugs or begs for money," 
the man said. "The people here are peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, an air-conditioned Amtrak train rumbled by with office workers 
hurrying home for dinner. The presence of the bathers is a well-known curiosity 
among commuters.

JAIL BECOMES FINAL TEST FOR ANTI-ABORTION PROTESTERS; 
</P>
<P>

The yacht broker's daughter was reading the Bible the day she got marked as a 
jailhouse snitch. Ephesians 5:11. "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful 
works of darkness, but rather expose them," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The words resounded like the inner voice that, on another day, had beckoned her 
to blockade an abortion clinic door. So when the guards barged in with a rumor 
that someone in her dormitory had cocaine, she stepped forward and -- before 
200 convicts -- bore witness against the inmate she had seen smoking crack in 
the toilet stall. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dead meat!" the inmate shrieked as the deputies dragged her away. 
Within moments, women were shoving their fists in the anti-abortion activist's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought, 'Speak the truth,' " the small, bespectacled woman would 
ruefully recall. Released last week from a Los Angeles County jail, she was 
forced to serve the rest of her time in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
For a wave of abortion protesters who, in the last two years, have grabbed 
headlines with clinic blockades and mass arrests, the time has come for a final 
test of their convictions -- jail. Across the country, thousands detained in 
demonstrations orchestrated by the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue are 
finally getting their day in court and, eschewing plea bargains, landing for 
days, weeks and, in some cases, months behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
With their Bibles and pamphlets, they are some of the most unlikely convicts 
ever to do time, bringing an often-credulous evangelism to a subculture defined 
by cynicism and sin. Churchgoing matrons with visions of jail as a "mission 
field" emerge from custody with tales of deliverance from homosexuality behind 
bars. Family men, confident that prayer will protect them from harm, tell of 
inmate brawls touched off by flash points as small as a borrowed pencil. 
</P>
<P>
Suburban couples talk about planning their incarceration the way they would 
prepare for a week out of town: drop the kids at grandma's, ask the neighbors 
to keep an eye on the house, arrange for someone to water the plants and feed 
the cats. They return to find their vocabularies laced with jail slang, saying 
"road-doggies" when they mean "co-defendants" and "kick out" instead of "early 
release." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue officials nationally estimate that about 50,000 rank-and-file 
activists have been arrested -- mostly for trespassing -- since the group was 
founded in 1988. So far, said spokesman Gary McCullough, "several thousand" 
have spent some time in jail, and perhaps 250 to 300 have earned the status of 
POC, "Prisoner of Christ," which is the group's designation for those who have 
spent more than 30 days behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
McCullough said that, as the cases have slowly wended their way through court, 
the group has had 50 to 80 POCs at any one time in jails across the United 
States. Last week, for example, there were 56, half of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, trespassing charges have been filed against 1,278 protesters 
who have demonstrated at local clinics where abortions are performed. So far, 
547 have been convicted, 10 and 20 at a time, and 728 await their day in court. 
Only a handful have accepted the government's offer of probation in exchange 
for a pledge to leave the abortion clinics alone, prosecutors say. The majority 
have opted for sentences ranging from several weeks of unpaid community service 
to several harsh months behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors assert that what is happening is part of an Operation Rescue 
strategy to clog the court system and jam the jails. But the organization says 
there is no such master plan. The only goal is to save the unborn. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, petty thieves, prostitutes and addicts who have served time with 
abortion opponents shake their heads in bemused respect for the Operation 
Rescue activists they have come to recognize on sight. 
</P>
<P>
"This place can be pretty shocking if you're not used to it," said Brenda 
Anderson, a convicted Santa Monica cocaine dealer who is winding up a year's 
jail term at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women in East Los Angeles. "And 
these people don't look like anybody you'd expect to see in here." 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Deborah Grumbine, 39, a Whittier podiatrist's wife with whom 
Anderson shared a jailhouse dorm. 
</P>
<P>
Until last Easter, Grumbine confined her activism to passing petitions, writing 
homemaking guides for Catholic wives and lawfully counseling women outside 
clinics where abortions are performed. But then came Operation Rescue, and soon 
the mother of seven found herself blockading women's clinics throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Her first sentence was five days at Sybil Brand, the most crowded facility in 
the county's packed network of jails. She served all five days in the 
institute's teeming reception area. The cigarette smoke was so thick that she 
had to shut herself in a broom closet just to get a breath of fresh air, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The metal bunks and the bathrooms were rank with the vomit and diarrhea of 
addicts in withdrawal. The food was the greasiest she had had in her life. On 
her first night, she watched wordlessly as the guards yanked a Latina inmate 
off the phone by the hair because the Spanish-speaking woman had either ignored 
or failed to understand their order to hang up. Grumbine maintained her stunned 
silence when more deputies forcibly restrained a hallucinating woman who was 
babbling hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
"I was beside myself," Grumbine said. "But you have to sit still and not move, 
or the deputies will do the same to you. So I just sat and prayed that the 
angels would protect (the inmates)." 
</P>
<P>
When she wasn't praying, she cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do something to make me not feel homesick. I've got a big family and 
I'm used to cleaning toilets," she said. "One of the girls there told me you 
can really tell the rescuers in jail by the way they always clean the 
bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, she said, inmates would ask why she had been arrested -- a 
question she and other Operation Rescue inmates welcomed because it provided an 
opening "for ministry." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mission field," enthused Susan Zook, 44, a co-defendant and neighbor of 
Grumbine. In fact, Zook said, she was so eager to spread the Operation Rescue 
gospel behind bars that she smuggled in a New Testament and a stack of "Life 
Begins at Conception" pamphlets on the day she was booked. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Grumbine said, during that first stay at Sybil Brand and a 15-day 
stay at the Mira Loma facility near Lancaster last month, she had little 
trouble -- except when it came time for bed. 
</P>
<P>
"This last time," she explained, "the woman below me was a really promiscuous 
homosexual. The first thing she asked was, 'Do you like women?' I said, 'I like 
Jesus.' That sort of took care of all the angles for me." 
</P>
<P>
But as night fell, she said, a parade of women crawled in and out of the bed 
below. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole bunk was shaking, and all the sounds were coming up from down below, 
and I just had to sort of pray to get through the night," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the next day, I got transferred to another bunk. You see? The Lord 
provides." 
</P>
<P>
Parables like that are part of what sets the Operation Rescue jail experience 
apart from that of the average inmate. No sacrifice, it seems, lacks a reward 
or a deeper purpose. Every story has a moral. 
</P>
<P>
Take Steve Kipp, a Monterey Park father of four who was punched in the stomach 
by an inmate because he refused to relinquish his jail-issue pencil. 
</P>
<P>
"It knocked the wind out of me," he said. "But it also drew the attention of 
all the other inmates in the tank. It was dead silence. I started talking about 
why I was in there. . . . Everybody was tuned in. And, you know, I feel God 
allowed that to happen so that I could have a listening ear. Before I left, I 
went over and shook the hand of the guy who took the pencil away. I said, 'I 
forgive you.' He just smiled sheepishly." 
</P>
<P>
Or take Danielle Mora, a 20-year-old Rancho Dominguez receptionist who went to 
Sybil Brand last month sporting a "Save a Baby, Go to Jail" T-shirt and armed 
with a full-color plastic model of a fetus at two months. 
</P>
<P>
Both items were confiscated, and Mora despaired of making an effect on her 
fellow inmates during her 90-day sentence for unlawful assembly and failure to 
disperse. Then she looked around, she said, and realized that she was not the 
only Operation Rescue woman in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, she said, she was hosting prayer meetings and songfests at her metal bunk 
aided by a nun and a minister's wife who had gone to jail for clinic blockades. 
And by her second day, she had a new visual aid. An inmate in the infirmary 
sent down a pamphlet with graphic photos of aborted fetuses, which Mora uses 
almost daily in lobbying pregnant inmates to carry their children to term. 
</P>
<P>
"All I've gotten here is encouragement," she said in a recent jailhouse 
interview. "I feel really blessed." 
</P>
<P>
To the cellmates of Operation Rescue defendants, such remarks are just another 
sign of their beatific eccentricity. There's no telling, the inmates say, how 
many abortions and lives of crime have been renounced just to shut a "rescuer 
lady" up. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Anderson recalled mirthfully an activist's story about the night the 
amorous conversation of two gay inmates kept the anti-abortionist awake. The 
activist prayed fervently for an end to homosexuality, she said, and when she 
stopped praying the inmates were asleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, wasn't that a miracle?" Anderson laughed. "I've been in here five times 
in my life, and every time I get more religious." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, she added, there is a "good aura" to the Operation Rescue women, who 
never call the inmates by their nicknames -- Shorty and Casper and Midnight -- 
but who say their Christian names in tones that are kindly and soft. 
</P>
<P>
"They were real nice," Anderson said. "As a matter of fact, one of them gave me 
a lead on a Christian home where they can help me get a new start." 
</P>
<P>
For the men of Operation Rescue, jail has been more menacing. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Monaghan, a Compton schoolteacher, said that at the outset of the 
220-day sentence he is serving at downtown's Hall of Justice jail, he was 
instructed by his dorm mates to steal food from the mess hall for them. He 
refused, and one night he looked up from his pale-green bunk to find himself 
encircled by men. They pushed him around for a few minutes before letting him 
walk away, he said. He hid in his bed for five days. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he said, he has learned to keep a low profile and tune out the 
violence that seems to be everywhere. When he tells his cellmates why he was 
arrested, he said, they seem baffled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's, 'Why would you jeopardize your teaching position, your time, to do 
something of this type?' " Monaghan said. When he explains, however, they seem 
to respect his beliefs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is more than he can say for his family. 
</P>
<P>
"He's put his job on the line. He's put his home on the line. I say to him, 
'You don't even have any children! Why are you so against this?' " fumed 
Monaghan's sister, Gilda Moreland, who also lives in Compton. "I tell him, 
'Dwight, God gives everybody choices, and you can't make people do right.' But 
those people in Operation Rescue only see things one way -- their way. And he 
says to me, 'Abortion is murder.' " 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan said he was drawn by his religion to become involved with Operation 
Rescue -- an involvement that, until his arrest, he hid from his superiors at 
the Compton Unified School District, where he teaches fifth grade. But because 
his jail term will run into the school year, he said, he felt compelled to tell 
his principal about his activism. School officials said this week the lengthy 
sentence has forced them to remove him from the teacher roster for September. 
Monaghan has applied for a sabbatical in hopes of preserving his job. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Kipp has put his livelihood on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 33-year-old father works as an administrator for an anti-abortion 
group, his wife, Lauralee, said the family finances have dipped drastically 
since he began serving a 220-day work-release sentence requiring him to put in 
40 hours of unpaid labor a week. 
</P>
<P>
Initially imposed as jail time, but converted because of overcrowding in the 
county jail, the sentence was a cause celebre for Operation Rescue, which has 
criticized the local judiciary for the harsh sentences judges have been 
imposing on anti-abortion activists for relatively minor crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. James K. Hahn noted that, in each case, the sentences were 
ordered because the Operation Rescue inmates refused to accept the plea bargain 
and its requirement to stop blockading clinics. Moreover, Hahn noted, a federal 
court order capping the population of the Los Angeles County Jail has prompted 
the Sheriff's Department to grant early release or work-release programs such 
as Kipp's to most of the activists. Typically, he noted, inmates end up serving 
less than 65% of the jail time to which they are sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
Even the unusual decision by some judges to stamp "no early release" on the 
paper work of Operation Rescue stalwarts has been ignored. In recent months, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Claudia Wrazel said she has begun offering several weeks or 
months of unpaid community service as an alternative to jail time. Unlike the 
plea bargains, she said, the defendant need not promise to avoid abortion 
clinics to get the community service option. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Kipp has been free for most of his highly publicized sentence, 
living at home while he works off his time washing buses at the Central Jail 
downtown. The work has cut sharply into the money he can earn at his regular 
job, said his wife, who nonetheless has chosen to stay home with their 
preschool children rather than get a job. Not long ago, she said, their 
18-month-old outgrew her dress shoes and they could not afford new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"It's costing us," Kipp said. "But when you weigh finance against what's 
happening to the unborn babies, there's no comparison." 
</P>
<P>
Which, he added, is why he plans to blockade another clinic at the earliest 
possible opportunity -- a sentiment shared by most, if not all, of the 
Operation Rescue inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"If God said, 'Take probation,' I suppose that's what I'd do, but he'd have to 
yell that pretty loud," said Grumbine. Though she is now two months' pregnant 
with her eighth child, she said she has no plans to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Christ is partial to those who get dumped in the tank," she said.

POLICY ON OIL: A CONTINUING U.S. DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Risky though the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait is for Western economies, some say 
the military confrontation might stand as a mere dress rehearsal for a true oil 
crisis that could be far harder to defuse. 
</P>
<P>
The real oil crunch draws closer every day that the world's reliance on oil 
from the unstable Middle East grows, these oil watchers say -- a dependence 
that has reversed course and climbed dramatically in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
A steep fall in oil prices that began in late 1985 has made oil more attractive 
to use but less rewarding to produce, with the result that demand is up and 
production outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is flat. 
Thus, the daily appetite for OPEC oil has surged by nearly 50% since then, to 
23 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, domestic oil output has tumbled to a 29-year low, and imports 
of crude have jumped to 50% of consumption -- most of it from OPEC nations -- 
surpassing the previous high of 45% that prevailed at the time of the 1979 oil 
shock. Already the world's oil nations are producing about 90% of the oil they 
can, the highest percentage since 1973. And the only nations whose oil output 
can be significantly expanded are members of the fractious OPEC cartel, whose 
hand is thus growing stronger by the day. 
</P>
<P>
These conditions are widely seen as a recipe for rising oil prices and all the 
ills that can result. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is military," says analyst Daniel Dreyfus of the Gas Research 
Institute and former staff director of the Senate Energy Committee, referring 
to the crisis caused by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "The next one will be 
economic. It won't take an invasion." 
</P>
<P>
The invasion has already renewed the familiar debate over U.S. energy policy, 
which critics consider to be almost non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
Various segments of the energy industry have proposed a floor on oil prices, 
greater access to public land for drilling, dollar incentives to capture more 
oil from old fields, a new generation of nuclear reactors, subsidizing oil 
exploration in foreign countries friendly to the United States, more federal 
funds for energy research and getting clean-coal technology to market. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer and environmental groups want stiffer auto gas-guzzler taxes and a 
gas-sipper rebate, higher gasoline taxes, tougher efficiency standards for 
motor vehicles, appliances and buildings, a "carbon user's fee," protection of 
public lands from drilling and research funds and subsidies for solar, wind and 
other renewable forms of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at the whole litany," says Philip Verleger Jr. at the 
International Institute for Economics in Washington. "We have to move in lots 
of directions." 
</P>
<P>
But unless oil prices continue to climb, skeptics doubt that this latest 
incident will trigger any lasting effort to cut usage, find more crude or wean 
the nation from oil toward other fuels -- all of which carry a price tag. 
History suggests that the public isn't willing to pay the price until a crisis 
is upon it and the damage is done. 
</P>
<P>
Says Dreyfus, "If somebody assassinated Saddam (Hussein) tomorrow and his 
troops staggered back to Baghdad, in two weeks you wouldn't even know it had 
happened other than a few people making speeches, the same speeches they've 
been making for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there unanimity that anything dramatic needs to be done. Advocates of 
the free-market approach that has stood for U.S. energy policy over the past 
decade say that -- given the reality of the Middle East's oil riches -- it has 
served the nation well. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly think the policy was right. It has avoided pain and cost for the 
consumer," says Fereidun Fesharaki, once an oil adviser to the Shah of Iran who 
heads energy research at the U.S. government-funded East-West Center in 
Honolulu. "We have to accept (the need for OPEC oil) and try to do things to 
make sure their economies and ours have mutual interests." 
</P>
<P>
This predicted oil crunch down the road reflects the same geologic dilemma that 
has helped to drive U.S. foreign policy since vast amounts of oil were 
discovered in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s, just in time to fuel the world's 
burgeoning fleet of cars, trucks and planes. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East holds about 70% of all known, economically recoverable crude 
oil, not counting the old East Bloc nations. The fields are not only the 
world's biggest but also the most prolific, the oil is the highest quality and 
the cost of producing it is the cheapest. 
</P>
<P>
That imbalance has steadily worsened as the United States, the world's biggest 
user of oil, depleted its own once-plentiful reserves. The nation's reliance on 
imported oil has since become one of the facts of life that define America's 
place in the world. 
</P>
<P>
This dependence has changed complexion from time to time, as oil strikes in 
Mexico, China, Canada, Venezuela and other regions outside the Middle East 
bolstered the big Alaska discovery of 1968 to help ease the U.S. vulnerability 
to the political uncertainties of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
But those were minor discoveries -- Alaska's biggest field has already begun 
its natural decline -- compared to the oil riches of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
Iraq, Iran and other Middle East members of OPEC, whose oil politics twice 
rocked the Western economies in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The oil jolts of 1973 and 1979 reduced actual supplies by a relatively minor 
amount, making them a particularly dramatic illustration of America's need for 
other people's crude. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month Arab oil embargo that began in October, 1973, removed an average 
of less than 3% of the oil production from world markets while the Iranian 
revolution in 1978-79 represented an average cutback of about 4%. By 
comparison, today's blockade of Iraq and Kuwait is apparently costing up to 4.5 
million barrels of crude per day -- roughly 8% of world production including 
the old East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The first energy shock bumped crude oil prices from $4 to $12 a barrel, the 
second from $13 to $37. The dramatic events helped bring down the presidency of 
Jimmy Carter, tore up the landscape with double-digit inflation and soaring 
interest rates and triggered a deep worldwide recession that fundamentally 
changed the industrialized economies. 
</P>
<P>
But the energy shocks also generated a dramatic response, starting with fuel 
economy standards for cars and extending to changes in the personal habits of 
Americans. The government imposed conservation programs and subsidized new 
industries to develop alternative forms of energy. While the oil industry got 
rich from the high prices, it used some of the money to find more oil. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation, fuel substitutions and the recession itself caused oil 
consumption to plummet, while supplies surged. The need for imported oil was 
reversed, undercutting the OPEC cartel. Prices began to slide in late 1981 and 
inflation oozed out of the economy, giving way to the Reagan-era prosperity 
that has continued into 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But an outright price collapse at the end of 1985 unleashed forces that have 
undone much of the progress on energy efficiency and slowly narrowed the gap 
between the world's need for oil and ability to supply it, setting the stage 
for the panicky run-up in oil and gasoline prices that greeted the invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
As 1986 unfolded, the price for a 42-gallon barrel of oil nose-dived from $30 
to as low as $9 a barrel, sowing the seeds for greater consumption of oil while 
putting a damper on oil production and exploration. The low prices and a 
free-market philosophy led the U.S. government to relax automotive fuel economy 
standards, raise speed limits and dismantle non-nuclear energy research and 
subsidy programs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of U.S. oil wells were closed as unprofitable, and 
industry exploration efforts tumbled. The remaining exploration outlays were 
redirected toward the most promising overseas areas where there is often less 
environmental opposition of the type that has kept oil producers out of the 
Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and some offshore California regions. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting big jump in imported oil entering the United States doesn't worry 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and West German economies have thrived despite their almost total 
reliance on imported oil. Free-market economists say Americans should sit back 
and enjoy the imported crude because it is cheaper to produce than our own, and 
thus save whatever reserves lie under Alaska and off the California shore to 
use when foreign sources finally dry up. Meanwhile, the decontrol of prices 
since the oil shocks of the 1970s will tend to self-correct the swings in oil 
markets, driving down demand and boosting supplies when prices surge. 
</P>
<P>
But many argue there is no free market in oil as long as OPEC is in operation, 
withholding oil from the market to prop up prices, and as long as other 
governments -- including Japan -- are in the business of subsidizing oil 
exploration and development. 
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. treated oil as a national security issue and supported oil 
production in some way, U.S. production would be a lot higher than it is and 
imports would be lower," says Joseph Story, a Washington consultant to 
oil-producing nations who has long experience in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The 50% oil-import benchmark has been suggested by politicians such as Sen. 
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) as a ceiling for the United States on the grounds of 
national security -- an argument bolstered by such incidents as the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Such initiatives have attracted little support in recent years. But the 
invasion of Kuwait, after the resurgence of the environment as a major issue in 
the United States, could foster debate once again on longer-term energy 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Under President Bush, a former oilman who also considers himself an 
environmentalist, congressional aides see a slight shift away from a Reagan 
energy policy described as one of benign neglect. The Bush Administration 
restored the maximum fuel economy standards for cars, for example, after the 
requirements had been relaxed annually for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"They're talking a better game on conservation and efficiency, but they haven't 
actually done much yet," says Jack Riggs, staff director for the House 
subcommittee on energy and power. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has ordered the Energy Department to propose options by next year for a 
"national energy strategy" that would attempt to make sense out of various 
contradictory federal policies. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration made the familiar free-market argument in resisting 
demands that the nation tap its 590-million-barrel strategic petroleum reserve 
(SPR) to defuse last week's run-up in oil prices -- a position that has been 
roundly criticized by the energy community. 
</P>
<P>
"It says a lot about energy policy," says Verleger, who argues that merely 
declaring an intent to use the reserve would have undercut the sharp run-up in 
gasoline prices. "The petroleum reserve is the only significant element of our 
energy policy, and the Administration didn't use it." 
</P>
<P>
For all the appeal of such renewable forms of energy as solar and wind power, 
which are now being used to make electricity in Southern California, the nation 
would have to cut into cars and trucks to make major inroads in oil 
consumption. More than 60% of the oil consumed by the United States now goes 
for transportation. Despite fuel-economy gains to date, cars and trucks alone 
use up the equivalent of the entire output of the nation's oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few things everybody agrees about is the virtue of natural gas, 
which is plentiful and burns more cleanly than oil. It has been described as a 
bridge fuel between the oil age and whatever comes after oil. But only a major 
role for natural gas to fuel cars -- which is now being attempted on an 
experimental basis -- would make a big dent in oil exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the use of oil to make electricity has been making a comeback 
because it has become so cheap, undermining progress made by nuclear, 
hydroelectric, natural gas, wind, solar and other cleaner and more plentiful 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Just how much enthusiasm the nation could muster for another round of 
investments in alternative energy is open to question. A rash of such ventures 
subsidized by the federal government in the early 1980s later collapsed when 
they either didn't work or couldn't compete with traditional fuels. It remains 
to be seen whether many would take the plunge again unless oil prices climb 
much higher than they have so far. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest such undertaking was Unocal Corp.'s oil-shale project in Parachute 
Creek, Colo., which has relied on federal price supports that guarantee a 
whopping $45 for every barrel of oil that the company manages to squeeze out of 
rocks. It has cost Unocal nearly $1 billion and the taxpayers up to $400 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Just as a continuation of this week's higher oil prices would tend to make the 
economy use less oil, it should encourage oil companies to explore for more 
oil. Today's leaner oil industry can find oil more cheaply and be profitable at 
lower prices than it could before the mid-1980s price collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic changes in the Soviet Union have raised hopes that an influx of 
Western oil technology could sharply boost oil production there. But Fesharaki, 
recently returned from the Soviet oil fields, says it will be decades before 
declining production there can be reversed. Experts blame poor drilling 
practices, deteriorating equipment, improper maintenance and antiquated 
technology for the bleak outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists say that even the best luck in turning up new oil reserves in 
Alaska, offshore California, the Far East, the Soviet Union and other promising 
areas would not change the overwhelming dominance of the Middle East. The 
region's control of an estimated 70% of the 808 billion barrels of oil left in 
the world doesn't even include unexplored areas such as the world's only known 
"mega-province," in geologists' parlance. That alone is thought to exceed 700 
billion barrels -- almost half of it Iraq's. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the only significant oil nations not producing oil flat-out are 
members of OPEC. Historically, the higher their share of world markets, the 
greater their power over prices. And except for Venezuela and Nigeria, the only 
ones that can readily boost output are in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-term problem," says G. Henry Schuler, a former Middle East 
oilman now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
"It is not something you can meet with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or with 
surge capacity in Venezuela. The problem is over-reliance on the Middle East." 
</P>

How Americans Use Oil 
</P>
<P>
Oil accounts for 42% of all U.S. energy needs. Foreign oil imports have 
increased 14.9% since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and now represent 50% of 
U.S. oil consumption.

INDIANS PROTEST WATER SALE TO SANTA BARBARA; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: CANADIAN FIRM'S PLAN TO REMOVE WATER NEAR BRITISH COLUMBIA RESERVATION 
WILL HARM THE ENVIRONMENT, NATIVES SAY. SANTA BARBARA CITY COUNCIL IS SET TO 
VOTE ON THE PROPOSAL.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Canadian company's proposal to export water by tanker to drought-stricken 
Santa Barbara is being challenged by an Indian tribe in British Columbia that 
claims the plan could damage the environment near its reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Snowcap Waters Ltd. of British Columbia has proposed selling to Santa Barbara 
water taken from a creek about 10 miles from the reservation of the Klahoose 
Indian band. The Indians are concerned that their "traditional tribal lands 
will be exploited," said Arlene Hope, chief of the band. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara City Council is expected to vote Tuesday on whether to 
approve the tanker water from Canada or desalination to supply the city with 
emergency water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
As the drought in California intensifies, an increasing number of Canadian 
firms have applied for permits to export water. Seven companies in Western 
Canada have received permits and 19 others have applied, government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The increased interest in exporting water is creating a controversy in Canada 
over whether its rivers and streams should be marketable commodities, said 
Geraldine Irby, a board member of the Sierra Club of Western Canada. The Sierra 
Club has questioned British Columbia's policy of granting licenses to 
water-exporting companies without requiring environmental impact reports. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't simply assume that removing all this water won't damage the 
ecosystem," Irby said. "An environmental impact report is the very least that 
should be required." 
</P>
<P>
Snowcap has proposed supplying Santa Barbara with up to 15,000 acre-feet of 
water each year from Tzela Creek, which feeds into the saltwater Toba Inlet, 
about 75 miles northwest of Vancouver. One acre-foot is the equivalent of about 
325,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
"All we want to do is take some of this freshwater that just empties into the 
ocean anyway," said Fred Paley, president of Snowcap. "More than 20 other 
creeks and rivers empty into this inlet . . . so I see no need for any 
environmental report." 
</P>
<P>
The Toba Inlet is a major salmon spawning area, and any change in the water 
flow could damage marine life, said Stan Guenther, a lawyer for the Klahoose 
Indians. Taking water from the area could change the inlet's temperature and 
its nutrient, oxygen and salt levels, he said. Also, the impact of frequent 
tanker traffic in a pristine inlet needs to be assessed, he said . 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's ever taken great quantities of the water that normally spills into 
the inlets," Guenther said. "Since it's unprecedented, nobody knows exactly 
what the effects will be." 
</P>
<P>
Guenther has sent letters expressing the Indians' concerns to British Columbian 
officials. If water is exported without an environmental impact report, the 
band could file a lawsuit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While environmental impact reports are not required, government officials will 
order them "when they consider it necessary," said Jim Mattison, a manager for 
the British Columbia Ministry of the Environment. To obtain an export permit, 
the company would have to prove the water is "surplus to local requirements" 
and meet other criteria, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snowcap has a permit to use Tzela Creek for bottled water and to export 200 
acre-feet a year by tanker. Paley said he was assured by government officials 
that the permit would be modified if the Santa Barbara proposal is approved. 
</P>
<P>
A series of glacial lakes north of Vancouver cascade down sheer granite 
mountainsides into Tzela Creek. The company is prepared to pump the creek water 
into ocean-going tankers and, at Santa Barbara, pump the water through a 
pipeline to a city reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Although no decision has been made, it appears unlikely that the Santa Barbara 
City Council will vote to import water from Canada. A local committee appointed 
to review proposals for emergency water supplies has recommended desalination 
for Santa Barbara. Three Canadian companies had submitted proposals to the 
city, and Snowcap made the lowest bid. 
</P>
<P>
No Canadian company has exported water by tanker. Snowcap is having discussions 
with other water agencies in Santa Barbara County and will soon make proposals 
to several California cities. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole issue of sending water to California will be attracting more and 
more public interest," British Columbia's Mattison said. "Some argue that the 
water goes into the ocean anyway so why shouldn't we support an industry that 
provides jobs. Others say we shouldn't be selling off a natural resource. The 
more California needs water, the bigger the issue will be in Canada."

LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE DIAPER WAR PROPOSALS; 
</P>
<P>
ECOLOGY: A LAWMAKER WANTS TO ENCOURAGE USE OF CLOTH DIAPERS BECAUSE OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. SOME BUSINESS GIANTS OPPOSE THE IDEA OF WARNING LABELS 
ON THE DISPOSABLE VARIETY.

<P>
It's cloth vs. disposable. Environmentalism vs. convenience. Manufacturers vs. 
delivery services. 
</P>
<P>
The Diaper Wars are heating up in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) has introduced legislation -- bitterly 
opposed by such industry giants as Proctor &amp; Gamble -- to encourage parents 
to swaddle their babies in reusable cloth diapers instead of the more common 
disposable variety. 
</P>
<P>
One of Killea's bills would tack a label on all disposable diapers, warning 
that "single-use disposable diapers pose significant environmental problems and 
costs when disposed. The state of California recommends that you consider 
reuseable diapers for your daily diaper needs." The other bill would require 
all day-care centers to give parents the option of wrapping their children in 
cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist groups such as the Sierra Club strongly support Killea's 
legislation because they believe that disposable diapers are a major 
environmental hazard. Every year, Californians dispose of 2.5 billion plastic 
diapers -- enough to cover a 10-foot-wide strip of Interstate 5 from the 
Mexican border to Oregon, according to Craig Reynolds, Killea's chief of staff. 
He said that it costs $50 million annually to dispose of all those diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said she is "confident" that warning labels will reduce the use of 
disposable diapers. "When people find out about the problems of disposable 
diapers, their immediate reaction is, 'Oh, I may not be able to give up 
disposable diapers all the time but it's a good argument,' " she said. "It will 
have an effect." 
</P>
<P>
Diaper manufacturers argue that while Killea's legislation may hurt their 
sales, it will not have a significant impact on the amount of waste headed for 
California landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"Disposable diapers contribute less than 2% of the entire flow into solid waste 
landfills," said Victor F. Stefan, a Sacramento lobbyist for Proctor &amp; 
Gamble. "There's no reason for banning disposable diapers since they have such 
a small effect on the landfills." 
</P>
<P>
When told of Stefan's comments, Sierra Club lobbyist Gordon Hart exclaimed: 
"Only 2%? My gracious! You know how many consumer goods there are -- and it's 
incredible if one of those goods represents 2% of the waste stream, especially 
when there's an obvious alternative for it." 
</P>
<P>
Killea's bill requiring day-care centers to give parents the option of using 
cloth diapers passed the Senate unanimously, breezed through two Assembly 
committees, and is scheduled for an Assembly floor vote this week. 
</P>
<P>
The bill requiring the warning label on disposable diapers has had rougher 
sledding. It was rejected by a Senate committee but reintroduced in the 
Assembly, where it passed one committee and is scheduled to be heard by the 
powerful Assembly Ways and Means Committee this week. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects for the child-care bill becoming law are considered better than 
the warning bill's chances. Supporters fear that Gov. George Deukmejian, who 
has not taken a stand on the issue, may object to the warning bill because of 
its perceived anti-business slant. 
</P>
<P>
The cloth vs. disposable diapers debate has sprung up in recent years as part 
of a general wave of environmentalism. Disposable diapers started to dominate 
the market in the 1960s, and now account for 85% of all diaper sales. But many 
parents have begun to rebel against the plastic underpants, leading to a 
resurgence of the more traditional cloth variety. 
</P>
<P>
Cloth diapers, often reused as many as 85 times, cost about the same or a 
little less to buy than the disposable diapers, which usually run 20 cents to 
25 cents per diaper. Parents can also use one of the resurgent diaper services. 
</P>
<P>
Dy-Dee Diaper Service -- one of the largest delivery companies in Southern 
California -- has experienced 200% growth during the last two years, President 
Tim O'Neil said. Dy-Dee serves 22,000 customers in Orange, Riverside and Los 
Angeles counties who pay $12.80 per week for 90 cloth diapers delivered to 
their doors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil attributed his company's phenomenal growth not only to increased 
environmental awareness, but to what he described as the health benefits of 
cloth diapers. The cotton diapers breathe more easily than plastic diapers, 
they are treated with a "germ fighter," and their acid level is individually 
adjusted for each baby, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Stewart, a spokesman for Proctor &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati, argued 
that disposable diapers are more convenient as well as more healthy than cloth 
underpants. The plastic diapers are designed with a layer close to the baby's 
skin that absorbs liquid and prevents babies from getting an infection or 
diaper rash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that a recent study conducted for his company by the management 
consulting firm of Arthur D. Little Inc. found that cloth diapers have no 
environmental advantage over their disposable counterparts. "Cloth diapers 
consume more water, release higher levels of total water pollutants and emit 
higher levels of total air pollution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club's Hart strongly disagreed. Citing the landfill problem as well 
as the hazardous wastes emitted during the manufacture of disposable diapers, 
he said: "I think the environmental community is quite convinced that any 
(negative) impacts from cloth diapers are clearly outweighed by the harmful 
impact of disposable diapers on the environment."

<P>
Now a flood of fire, now a flood of ice, now a flood of water.... -- John Muir 
</P>
<P>
So this time, we got a flood of fire. Muir would have loved it. The sky has 
turned the color of jaundiced skin and smoke is everywhere. You can stand on 
the valley floor and barely make out the ghostly profile of Half Dome. Here in 
Yosemite, the fire has created a season of its own, spooky and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
And the flames, which licked at the valley's gates but never reached inside, 
have achieved something historic. They have succeeded where legions of 
environmentalists have failed. In the middle of summer, Yosemite's prime time, 
the fire has shooed the tourists out of the valley. They are gone, totally 
gone, with their cars and their campers and their no-neck monster kids. Gone 
are the buses, as big as zeppelins, and the sweet diesel smog they created. 
Gone, all gone, for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
Their mass departure has left the valley in a condition not seen in our 
lifetime. And maybe never again. Here, in high summer, you can sit at the base 
of Bridalveil Falls and have it all to yourself. Or you can stroll by the 
Merced River and be guaranteed, more or less, that no one will float by on a 
Day-Glo inner-tube. 
</P>
<P>
The only people left in this valley world are the natives. I'm talking about 
the rangers and the motel maids and the horse wranglers, everyone who normally 
spends their days giving service to the tourists. They have remained, free to 
ramble around the empty valley like survivors after a war. For the time being, 
they own the place. 
</P>
<P>
This temporary revision of the social equation seems to have inspired a new 
assertiveness on the part of the survivors, even those of the wildlife variety. 
The deer, in particular, have advanced much closer to their human counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday morning, for example, a male-female pair walked up to the back 
entrance of the supermarket, which remains open, and stood brazenly on the 
asphalt begging for handouts. After a while, a clerk emerged from the store, 
petted the male deer, and then hung a small sign around its neck. The sign 
said, "Will Work for Food." 
</P>
<P>
As for the humans, they lost no time in claiming some of the turf formerly 
denied them. Yesterday, there was a party, a barbecue to celebrate the tourist 
evacuation. Everyone sprawled on the grass, munched potato chips and listened 
to Talking Heads albums. But this was not just any piece of grass. It was the 
back lawn of the Ahwahnee Hotel, where normally the tonier breed of tourist 
pays a couple hundred a night for the privilege of sprawling. 
</P>
<P>
The natives munched and celebrated in their symbolic way for several hours and 
then left. Afterward, the old pile of a hotel turned completely silent and, in 
the smoky afternoon, looked like a ruin. 
</P>
<P>
You might think this new sense of possession would lift spirits here. Oddly, 
that does not seem to be the case. In fact, the subject receiving most 
attention over the last two days is neither the raging holocaust nor the wonder 
of an empty valley. It's booze. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the valley, all bars have been closed for the duration. And at the 
supermarket liquor counter, a sign advises that only one six-pack of beer or 
bottle of wine will be sold "per I.D." These signs went up even as the tourists 
left, apparently reflecting the desire of the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. to 
keep its employees sober, or relatively so, during the hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the system has succeeded remains a question. But it certainly has 
produced a nightly drama in the supermarket, where extraordinary I.D. maneuvers 
are countered by equally extraordinary vigilance on the part of the clerks. 
This test of wills and imagination has reached such heights that the company 
now calls the supermarket each morning to get the tally of wine bottles and 
six-packs sold the previous evening. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, it keeps everyone occupied. One clerk said she enjoyed working 
the night shift just to see which side was winning. Thus far, she estimated, 
the drinkers have the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
As we talked, it struck me that there was something reassuring about the booze 
fight. Perhaps the natives had been set adrift without the tourists who, after 
all, are simply the rest of us. Maybe they were filling the absence with 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
I asked the clerk about herself, and how the interregnum was going. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, it's wonderful, she said, and then smiled sadly. There was not another 
customer in the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I think," she said, "I can stand it for about three more days."

<TEXT>
<P>
Three months ago, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto finally took action against the 
corruption and incompetence that threatened her fragile government: She ordered 
alterations at her family home, Bilawal House. 
</P>
<P>
Workers suddenly surrounded the posh seaside villa with a 30-foot-high 
reinforced-concrete wall topped with sharp spikes. Gun turrets, with slits for 
machine guns, were put atop each corner. Barbed wire was laid out front. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a week after Bhutto was abruptly deposed, the transformation of Bilawal 
explains much of the tragedy of Benazir Bhutto, hailed only 20 months ago as a 
champion of Pakistan's poor and a darling of Western democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"She got increasingly arrogant," a Western diplomat said. "She got out of 
touch. And she got paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times inside the armed compound, Bhutto, who suffered 
nearly five grim years in prison under the previous military regime, said she 
is afraid today -- for herself and for Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to bed at night waiting for a knock on the door," she said softly. 
"Normally, they come in the night to arrest you. Across the country, there's a 
great deal of uncertainty. No one knows what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Backed by Pakistan's powerful, politicized army, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan 
pledged free elections, citing corruption and misuse of power. Bhutto says she 
will run and win what most predict will be a bitter and bloody campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought is quite traumatic," Bhutto said. "I think: 'Oh my God, do we want 
to go through this again?' But then I think it's a matter of honor. The way 
they dismissed us was so unjustified. So totally wrong. We must fight on." 
</P>
<P>
But the 37-year-old Radcliffe and Oxford graduate said she will "not recognize" 
or submit to special courts that the interim government is creating to 
investigate charges -- made by diplomats, businessmen and analysts as well as 
her opponents -- that Bhutto's government was the most openly corrupt in 
Pakistan's 43-year existence. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, she refused to concede any corruption in her family or Cabinet. She 
blamed the press instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been trial by newspapers," she said angrily. "It's like witch hunts in 
medieval times. We've been hounded by hearsay and rumor." 
</P>
<P>
Alternately defiant, strident and appealing for sympathy, the first woman to 
head a modern Islamic state defended her attempt to lead this impoverished 
country and third-largest recipient of U.S. aid into a working democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"My head is held high," she said. "I didn't make any compromises." 
</P>
<P>
She also didn't make much progress. Bhutto leaves little but a souring economy, 
a restive military and a cycle of urban terrorism and ethnic violence that has 
killed at least 400 people this year here in Sind province, her home region. 
</P>
<P>
Her administration passed two budgets, but nothing else. Businesses and 
bureaucracies were burdened with 26,000 patronage appointees. Prices shot up 
for food and fuel. She was headstrong and naive. Her aides were worse. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto admits her staff was "young and inexperienced," but she insists that 
wasn't the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never given a chance," she argued. "From day one, our hands and feet 
were tied. There was a whispering campaign, of intrigue, innuendo and slander." 
</P>
<P>
Political rivals tried to bribe her supporters. She charged that religious 
mullahs undermined her and that military intelligence tapped her phones, 
compiled dossiers on key aides and spread false stories. 
</P>
<P>
"This is political victimization," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's also familiar ground for Bhutto. Her courage as a political prisoner only 
added to her charisma as an opposition leader after Pakistan's army strongman, 
Gen. Zia ul-Haq, deposed her popular father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and had him 
hanged in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto never forgave the army for her father's death. Apparently they never 
trusted her. After her election in November, 1988, the army kept control of 
intelligence operations and most foreign policy, particularly concerning 
Afghanistan and Kashmir, a disputed region claimed by India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the crunch came when Bhutto refused to give the army extralegal 
powers to stop violence in Sind because she did not want to antagonize her 
supporters there. 
</P>
<P>
But Bhutto blames unnamed officials in military intelligence for bringing her 
down. Their goal, she says, was to discredit democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why military intelligence is so dangerous," she said. "They sit there 
and brief the army and the opposition with fabricated, handmade and concocted 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
Many, however, clearly don't believe Bhutto's denials of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen say kickbacks and payoffs were needed for everything from export 
licenses to property loans. A banker complained that low-paid civil servants 
were driving new Mercedes cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The corruption is so blatant and so arrogant," he said. "And she never once 
said: 'OK, let's clean house, let's look at the charges.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto insisted she asked for evidence but never got it. And she grew angry 
when asked about her businessman husband, Asif Zardari, known for his polo 
ponies and his alleged interests in government licenses for television, 
telephones, oil and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is an honorable man," she said. "His businesses have not prospered. 
They have suffered under my government. The charges against him are false and 
baseless." 
</P>
<P>
The night before, Zardari had entered a downtown political dinner like royalty. 
Scores of burly, bearded men in traditional flowing shirts and upturned 
slippers lined up to hug and kiss the only man sporting an expensively tailored 
Western suit and the nickname "Mr. Ten Percent." 
</P>
<P>
Zardari said he expects to be "the chief target" of the special corruption 
courts. "Their goal is to use me to get to her," he said. "Let them do their 
worst. I have nothing to hide." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Bhutto works under semi-siege in Bilawal House, presiding over party 
meetings, greeting well-wishers, sipping soft drinks. Aides hand out press 
releases and warn darkly of impending arrests by a government packed with her 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, police announced the arrests of five of Bhutto's associates, saying 
they were the first cases in an investigation of corruption in her government.

WARRING BLACK FACTIONS BLAMED AS GUNFIRE KILLS 9 IN SOUTH AFRICA

<P>
Six men and three women were killed in gunfire at a hostel south of 
Johannesburg, in what police said appeared to be a fight among black factions. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Eugene Opperman told the independent South African Press Assn. 
that the attackers fired through the windows of two rooms in the black workers' 
hostel in Sebokeng on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Four men and three women were killed in the shooting and two other men died 
later in a hospital; 15 people were wounded. Police said they found several 
Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Opperman said that the motive for the attack was unknown. "We can only presume 
that it is differences among different black groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He disputed a township resident's claim that the violence was between 
supporters of the African National Congress and the conservative, Zulu-based 
Inkatha Party. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting followed violence in townships around Johannesburg between ANC 
supporters and other residents. 
</P>
<P>
At least 22 people were killed on July 22 in Sebokeng, after armed Inkatha 
supporters clashed with residents whom ANC leaders had warned of an Inkatha 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month in Kagiso, east of Johannesburg, at least 12 people were 
killed in two days of fighting between Inkatha backers and other residents. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 blacks have died since 1986 in fighting between Inkatha and ANC 
supporters in the eastern province of Natal. 
</P>
<P>
Fears that the conflict may be spreading to other parts of the country were 
raised in recent weeks as fighting between Inkatha and opposing groups erupted 
in areas around Johannesburg.

BARRY PLANNING TO LEAVE PARTY, TOP AIDES SAY

Mayor Marion Barry is receiving conflicting advice on whether he should run for 
City Council but is planning to drop his Democratic Party affiliation as a 
first step, aides said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, convicted Friday of one cocaine possession charge and acquitted of 
another, plans to drop out of the Democratic Party and register as an 
independent today, said top Barry aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
That would be Barry's first step toward a campaign for an at-large seat on the 
District of Columbia's 13-member council, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the deadline for switching parties. If Barry becomes an independent, 
he would then have to gather the signatures of 2,000 registered city voters 
before his name could be placed on the ballot. He would compete for two 
citywide council seats with winners of the Republican, Democratic and Statehood 
party primaries. 
</P>
<P>
While some of Barry's advisers feel he should resume his career, others are 
wary of antagonizing U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson or 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has not yet set a sentencing date for Barry's misdemeanor cocaine 
possession conviction, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison 
and a $100,000 fine. U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens has not yet revealed whether he 
intends to retry Barry on a dozen charges on which the jury couldn't reach a 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Barry's advisers believe the government would be more likely to pursue 
the case -- and Jackson would be more inclined to send the mayor to jail -- if 
Barry is actively campaigning for office.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tamil gunmen rampaged through five fishing villages, butchering Muslims in the 
street with machine-gun fire and machetes, military officials said Sunday. They 
said that at least 119 people were slain. 
</P>
<P>
The killings were the latest in a round of intensifying ethnic violence that 
pits Tamil separatists against the Sinhalese-dominated government and Sinhalese 
and Muslim civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Although Muslims claim neutrality in the war, the government says that Tamils 
suspect them of siding with the army. 
</P>
<P>
A Tamil politician said that Saturday night's attacks were in retaliation for 
the killing of 33 Tamil villagers by Muslims earlier Saturday. But a spokesman 
for the Tamil Tigers guerrilla group denied responsibility for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
At least 450 villagers have been killed on the once-tranquil island nation's 
east coast in a wave of reprisal violence in the last nine days. 
</P>
<P>
The victims include 305 Muslims, 85 Tamils and 60 Sinhalese, according to 
military officials and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In Eravur, one of the villages hit in Saturday night's attack, puddles of blood 
were on the sidewalk. Women implored visitors to help keep them safe, and young 
men surrounded army officers demanding weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"They have killed everybody," one weeping woman told a delegation of Muslim 
politicians and soldiers. "There is no one to look after us. Please don't 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
Led by Muslim religious leaders, villagers gathered up corpses in trucks for a 
mass burial. Residents and military officials on Sunday said that in addition 
to at least 119 fatalities in the five villages, another 40 people were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Upali Seneviratne, the top army officer in the province, said at least 40 
Tamil gunmen attacked the villages. 
</P>
<P>
After a 90-minute raid on Eravur, the gunmen moved to adjacent villages, 
military officials said. One of the villages is called Saddam Hussein, named 
after the Iraqi leader who sent construction aid several years ago.

PAYNESVILLE, Liberia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government troops mounted a successful counterattack Sunday, dashing rebel 
hopes of seizing the capital before a West African task force arrives to impose 
peace. Troops also fired on civilians, and refugees said that at least 18 were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies of refugees and pieces of clothing from their bundles of belongings were 
seen scattered in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Troops from the government's 72nd Battalion advanced behind an armored car 
Sunday morning from their camp in the Paynesville suburb on Monrovia's eastern 
outskirts and cut off a group of rebels trying to take Spriggs Payne airfield. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel troops ran away as government troops advanced. The government forces 
opened fire on fleeing civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists counted the bodies of 15 people, including those of small children, 
lying in a half-filled culvert where they had tried to seek cover. Three other 
bodies lay in the road nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 5,000 people who have died in the civil war to date were civilians 
slaughtered by both sides because of their tribal affiliations. The war began 
eight months ago, and today two rival rebel armies are fighting to overthrow 
the government of President Samuel K. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Sierra Leone, meanwhile, three ships carrying 1,000 Ghanaian 
soldiers arrived in the capital of Freetown, after the leader of the 
five-nation West African peacekeeping force launched an urgent appeal for a 
cease-fire in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
West African leaders decided at a June 6 meeting in Gambia to send the 
peacekeeping troops to Liberia. And on Saturday, the commander of the West 
African force, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quianoo, called for the fighting to end 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Liberia creates profound anxiety not only in Africa, but in 
the entire international community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Johnson, chief of one of the rebel armies, said Saturday that he was 
sending a delegation to Freetown to make arrangements for the peacekeeping 
force to land in Monrovia's port, which he has controlled for the past two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Quianoo has not announced a date for deployment of the force. Military sources 
in Freetown said departure of the force has been delayed by the need to carry 
all its own supplies to Monrovia, which has been without fresh food, running 
water, electricity and regular telephone communications for more than a month.

PUBLIC OPINION IN ISRAEL HARDENS AGAINST DEALINGS WITH PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis has strengthened the hand of the right-wing 
administration of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the hawks at the expense of 
Israeli doves, government sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking," said a high government official, "the political right is 
gaining much more from the events of the past 10 days than the left. 
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli man in the street is increasingly concerned about national 
security and doesn't want to negotiate changes in Israel's security by dealing 
with the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
The two events that apparently have hardened Israeli public opinion against 
negotiations -- a policy more favored by the opposition Labor Party than the 
governing coalition -- are Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and support of that action 
by the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's reaction to the crisis and to threats by Iraq's 
President Saddam Hussein has been measured: Shamir has urged calm and Defense 
Minister Moshe Arens has said that Israel is capable of defending itself. 
</P>
<P>
But Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, the former defense minister who was largely 
responsible for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, has been shrill in his 
comments. Sharon, who has a wide popular following, said that the United States 
should take prompt military action to force the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon we shall see pictures of hungry Iraqi babies and children on television, 
the demand will grow to bring home the troops, the hostage problem will grow 
acute and America's partners will tire of the long wait in the desert," Sharon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If action is necessary, then now is the time for swift military action. The 
more time passes, the more the world will grow accustomed to the idea that 
Kuwait is part of Iraq, and it will become more difficult to get the Iraqis 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Government sources indicated privately that they are happy that Sharon is 
busily involved in finding homes and jobs for Soviet immigrants -- the main 
domestic problem in the country -- rather than dealing with defense matters. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Labor opposition figures have been muted in their criticism of 
the government during the crisis, except for an outburst by opposition leader 
Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
Peres said that the Shamir government is "devoid of leadership," adding that it 
is "not making its voice heard" on the Iraqi crisis, while at the same time 
warning against creating an atmosphere of panic. 
</P>
<P>
But this view was contradicted by another Labor Parliament member, Ezer 
Weizman, a former general and defense minister, who praised the "calm but firm" 
response to the crisis by Shamir and Arens. 
</P>
<P>
"Shamir said what had to be said," Weizman said. "I think the government has 
acted wisely, coolly. They deserve full marks in this volatile situation." 
</P>
<P>
Government leaders believe that by supporting Hussein, the Palestinian 
rank-and-file and the PLO leadership have earned the further enmity of many 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mood of Israelis is that there is no point negotiating with 
Palestinians who support a leader like Saddam, who wants to wipe us off the 
face of the earth," one official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Another Israeli specialist on Arab affairs said: "I think the real mood of the 
people was shown during last week's riots in Jerusalem over the murder of the 
two youths. Saddam Hussein is still a long way away, but these killings 
happened in our own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, including the religious Jews who took part in the riots, are 
going to blame the Labor Party for allowing the conditions under which this 
could happen."

2 SURVEYS FIND MAJORITY SYMPATHETIC TO HOMELESS;

<P>
Public support for homeless people remains high despite some recent reports 
that Americans are beginning to lose sympathy for them, two independent 
research groups have reported. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of residents of Buffalo, N.Y., 66% said they blame societal forces 
such as unemployment for the plight of the homeless, while 34% said they blame 
the homeless themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a poll of Nashville residents revealed that 58.6% blamed society. 
The studies were reported Saturday at the annual meeting of the American 
Psychological Assn. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is very supportive of the homeless," said Paul Toro, a psychologist 
at the State University of New York in Buffalo. "There appears to be support 
for the homeless across the political spectrum and across the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Toro said he disputes several recent media reports suggesting that the public 
is becoming fed up with the homeless and their problems. Four major surveys 
over three years, he said, show public support for helping the homeless has not 
wavered. And no evidence of weakening public support is apparent in data 
compiled through April of this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our data are in conflict with those findings" that the public is losing 
sympathy, Toro said. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the aggressive tactics of some street panhandlers might cause 
some resentment of the homeless even though general public support has not 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Nashville and Buffalo studies found that the public is eager to seek 
solutions to the homeless crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Only crime was rated as more important than homelessness," said David Lewis of 
Vanderbilt University. The Nashville study was based on a telephone poll of 293 
people and the Buffalo survey used 240 respondents. 
</P>
<P>
In the Buffalo study, 59% of the respondents said they believed that the 
homeless problem is worsening, and 58% said they believed that the federal 
government was most responsible for helping the homeless. Only 19% said they 
believed that state government was primarily responsible. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of those surveyed, 59%, said they are willing to pay more taxes 
to help the homeless. Most said they favored increased job training and 
building more low-cost housing over increasing welfare spending or raising the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Toro said he found that widespread media coverage of homelessness has 
enlightened the public. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is amazingly knowledgeable about characteristics of the homeless," 
he said. "If you have a good image about a person -- which most Americans have 
about the homeless -- it's easier to support them." 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness is a major issue at the 98th annual APA convention that runs 
through Tuesday. In other studies on homelessness reported at the convention: 
</P>
<P>
* Pennsylvania State University researchers also found that the public blames 
society for the problems of the homeless, but the experts cautioned that 
support for the homeless could easily fall given "the public's limited 
attention span" and alternative public worries, such as environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Adolescents are living on the streets at a much younger age than they did 
several years ago and have more problems than adult homeless people, a Berkeley 
researcher reported. Marjorie Robertson said her study revealed that homeless 
adolescents have many more health problems than teen-agers living at home. 
One-quarter of homeless adolescents surveyed in Hollywood rated their health as 
only fair or poor. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly one-third of the nation's 1.5 million homeless are veterans, reported 
Sumner Garte of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Chicago. According to 
Garte, a high percentage of homeless veterans may have used the military to 
escape from a poor economic situation. While these men are in the military 
"they learn skills that are not transferable to the job market," Garte said.

A group of workers at the City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte won the 
$43-million jackpot in the weekend California Lottery "Lotto 6-53" game, a 
hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen employees of the medical records department were "quietly 
celebrating," said Charles Mathews, a hospital spokesman. One ticket from their 
pool had all six of the winning numbers. "They have to do a lot of accounting 
work," he said. "The money has to be divided 17 ways, but in different shares 
because some people bought more tickets than others."

Mayor Anne Rudin and other city officials are looking for ways to protect

Mike Winters of the Sacramento Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

between noon and 7 p.m. when the temperature rises above 80, and limit 
carriages to no more than four passengers.

FUTURE BRIGHTENS OVER POWAY'S BLUE SKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will fortune finally smile on Blue Sky Ranch? 
</P>
<P>
This wedge of Poway's Green Valley area that lies between the Ramona and Poway 
reservoirs has a history that reads like a daytime soap opera: "As the 
Wilderness Turns." 
</P>
<P>
Blue Sky is the heroine. Developers are the villains. Poway residents are the 
rescuers, and the state Fish and Game Department is providing the happy ending. 
But, because soap operas never end, the 400-acre Blue Sky wilderness area will 
probably continue to exist from crisis to crisis, forever teetering on the 
brink of another calamity. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Sky Ranch was a name given the property by its Los Angeles-area owners 
(including film star Jane Wythers) who planned to sell the land to a developer 
for estate homes. That was in the early 1980s, hundreds of years after the 
first residents -- probably Diegueno Indians -- chose the site for their 
hunting grounds, leaving encampment evidence behind that remains undisturbed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Sky contains all the prerequisites for a wildlife Eden: two year-round 
streams, a waterfall or two, dense copses of coastal oaks, a few rare Engelmann 
oaks, grasslands, meadows, riparian habitat and coastal sage scrub on the upper 
elevations. Cougars, coyotes, deer, fox and other animals inhabit the area, as 
do hawks, vultures, blue jays and a few black-tailed gnatcatchers. 
</P>
<P>
When developers sought permits for housing developments in the tangled thickets 
of the valley's lowlands and on the rocky hillsides with dramatic views to the 
ocean, they found that the newly incorporated city of Poway, which includes 
Blue Sky Ranch, had definite ideas of what the pristine wilderness should 
contain: nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Cannon, Poway's parks and landscape manager, said developers who were 
interested in buying the land ran into a snarl of state and local environmental 
obstacles prohibiting development in riparian wetlands and on steep hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"It was impossible to get the density there that they needed to make the 
project pencil out," Cannon said. One developer submitted a tentative 
subdivision map for about 120 homes in Blue Sky, then withdrew his plan after 
being told of the political and environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Goldsmith, a Poway city councilman, recalls how Poway residents came to the 
rescue. He was a founder of Citizens for Preservation of Blue Sky Ranch and 
began a drive to save the wilderness area -- which was never a real ranch and 
still contains its native vegetation -- and turn it into a nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
All that was needed was $2.6 million, more or less, to pay off the investors 
and put the land into public ownership, safe from development. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith recalls the many ups and downs. At times, state funds seemed almost 
within reach, only to disappear into some other more-favored project or to be 
devoured by a budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the landowners became more than a little impatient at the volunteer 
group's slow progress in coming up with the cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was really against it. No one said that we shouldn't try to do this," 
said Jim McCarty, another founder of Citizens for Preservation of Blue Sky 
Ranch. "I think even the owners were kind of anxious that we succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started this project (in 1987), we said we'd give it two years, and 
there were some big disappointments. But, about 18 months into it, we decided 
that it was looking good." 
</P>
<P>
The group gained a strong supporter in veteran state Sen. William Craven 
(R-Carlsbad), who sponsored a bill to acquire Blue Sky with state park bond 
funds. Poway residents and environmental groups from throughout the county 
rallied behind the legislation, and it headed for passage in the final days of 
the 1988 session. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the year that the Legislature wrangled especially fiercely over 
major legislation, coming to within minutes of a mandated adjournment deadline 
before reaching a compromise on the main issues. When the dust cleared, 
Craven's bill to acquire Blue Sky lay in a heap of legislation that was not 
acted upon. It died an unheralded death. 
</P>
<P>
But Craven and the Blue Sky stalwarts turned their attention to other sources. 
They finagled $1.8 million from unexpended state discretionary funds, $500,000 
from San Diego County, a few hundred thousand dollars from a Fairbanks 
developer who needed off-site mitigation for having destroyed a black-tailed 
gnatcatcher habitat at another housing project, thousands of dollars in private 
donations, and $30,000 from the city of Poway to cinch the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the problem of turning the land into an ecological reserve and 
protecting it from its human neighbors, who use it as a dumping ground for 
everything from toxics to Toyotas. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders, who had always sought to keep Blue Sky in its natural state, 
agreed to manage the preserve as an extension of the adjacent Lake Poway 
recreation area. But then Poway received an offer it could not refuse. The 
state Fish and Game Department offered to include Blue Sky in its new program 
to acquire vanishing wild lands. It would be protected from development and 
from the hunters and fishermen who are wont to consider the areas as game 
preserves. 
</P>
<P>
The program was to be supported by contributions from what bureaucrats called 
"non-consumptive users" -- Californians who want to preserve remaining 
undeveloped areas of the state in their natural states, simply to enjoy the 
scenery and to learn about the wild critters that live there. 
</P>
<P>
According to Monica Parisi, a Fish and Game Department naturalist, Blue Sky was 
made to order for the publicly supported California Wildlands Program. She 
arrived at Blue Sky last March and promptly fell in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there are a few things she wants to change. The years of dumping will 
require a community cleanup effort this fall, and there is evidence of migrant 
workers' camps among the oaks. 
</P>
<P>
She called the task of turning the rough country into an ecological reserve "a 
real challenge" and has spent her time assessing Blue Sky and determining just 
what can be done to prevent intrusion by automobiles and hunters. 
</P>
<P>
After the cleanup, she will present her plans for a trail system through the 
preserve, carefully avoiding the poison oak, which covers much of the lowlands 
and hangs like vines from trees along the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a blessing, really. It keeps people on the trails," Parisi said of the 
poison oak. Less than 1% of the state's original riparian habitat remains 
untouched, she said, and Blue Sky is worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she hopes to include an interpretive center and administration building 
so that educational tours and lectures can be given. But first, she wants a 
parking lot for the visitors and a gate to keep the trash dumpers out. A small 
office with a telephone would be nice, too, she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a big order for a state worker who didn't know when or if she would be 
getting her next paycheck until the Legislature ended its record budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis in the Blue Sky soap opera wasn't over, however, until Gov. 
George Deukmejian completed his blue-penciling on the legislators' budget 
package and signed the document. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Fish and Game Department's budget emerged unscathed, including 
the operating budget for Blue Sky and Parisi's salary for the coming year. But 
stay tuned for the next episode of "As the Wilderness Turns" to find out 
whether fortune has finally smiled on Blue Sky Ranch for good, or just for the 
moment.

FAMILY MAKES A NERVE-RACKING ESCAPE FROM IRAQ

With tension and confusion escalating in Baghdad, where 500 American citizens 
remain stranded, Dr. Ghazi Shaba made his decision: His family would try to 
escape Iraq by making a marathon bus ride across the desert to the Jordan 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen hours later, having endured nerve-racking searches and questioning by 
Iraqi soldiers, the San Diego County family crossed the border safely, among 
the first Americans to be allowed out of Iraq or Kuwait during the current 
Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Shaba, his wife, Edna, and sons, Namir, 12, and Steven, 11, entered Jordan on 
Wednesday. They took a flight from the capital of Amman on Saturday to 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and then Los Angeles. They arrived at their Jamul home 
early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a risk getting on that bus, but I knew we had to take the chance. I 
made the decision even though we didn't know what would happen on the road from 
minute to minute," said Shaba, a physician with Kaiser Permanente in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frightening, very confusing. We were praying constantly to get across 
the border," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaba's successful odyssey is tinged with sadness: His parents, who live in 
Baghdad, are ill. After a joyous reunion in mid-July, their first meeting in 18 
years, Shaba knows he probably will not see them again. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to visit my parents and to vacation, but then everything turned very 
confusing," he said. "It was very emotional, leaving my parents again after 18 
years. We were very upset." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials continue efforts to get more Americans out of Iraq and 
neighboring Kuwait, which was invaded and annexed by Iraq on Aug. 2. Some 
Americans, mostly relatives of diplomats and members of the U.S. Embassy, 
arrived in Jordan over the weekend after battling the same frustration the 
Shaba family faced in getting permission to leave Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Other vehicles carrying Americans and other foreign citizens from Baghdad have 
been turned back by Iraqi authorities at the Jordan-Iraq border. More than 500 
American citizens remain in Baghdad and another 3,000 in Kuwait. The U.S. 
government does not yet consider the remaining Americans to be hostages. 
</P>
<P>
After months of planning to visit relatives in Iraq -- both Shaba and his wife 
were born there and moved to the United States two decades ago -- the Shabas 
arrived in Baghdad on July 16. The Iraqi government announced Aug. 2 that a 
coup had occurred in Kuwait and that Iraqi troops had been invited to cross its 
border, Shaba said. A news blackout was imposed in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get any news from the outside, any Western news," Shaba said. "We 
didn't learn until a few days later what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
When he began to understand the extent of the crisis, Shaba said, he called the 
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and was warned to leave immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Use of roads and airports was limited. Foreigners were faced with confusing and 
rapidly changing restrictions on who could leave the country, Shaba said. 
Iraqis and Kuwaitis -- now considered under Iraqi jurisdiction since the 
annexation -- were not allowed to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Arab nationals were turned back. Some (foreigners) could leave if you had been 
in the country for less than one month, but two days later that changed, and 
you had to have an exit visa," Shaba said. "It was very confusing." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, after days of contacting the Iraq government and U.S. Embassy, 
Shaba heard a rumor that Italian and Japanese tourists had been allowed to 
cross the Jordanian border. That night, he got his family on a bus for a 
600-mile bus ride through the desert to that border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
During the 15-hour drive along the desolate road, Iraqi soldiers stopped them 
at least two dozen times, boarding the bus with guns to inspect passports and 
baggage and question the passengers, Shaba said. There was no food and little 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a relaxing escape. It was like a James Bond movie, very 
frightening. We didn't know what would happen in the next mile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the border, there were more inspections and interrogations, and at one point 
it seemed that Shaba's wife and children would be allowed to pass without him. 
But Shaba said he and his wife were able to converse in Arabic with the 
soldiers, smoothing the way for their crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"We used our common sense in talking with them. I kept persuading them. The 
soldiers were hostile to some Americans, but we were treated very well," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the emotional ordeal of the escape is over, his family remains 
concerned about their relatives in Baghdad, Shaba said. All Iraqi men ages 16 
to 55 are being drafted, and residents are worried as the military crisis 
worsens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are carrying on with their lives, but they don't know what is going to 
happen," he said.

OCEAN SCIENTISTS FEAR NAVY SUPPORT MAY EBB; 
</P>
<P>
GEOPOLITICS: SCRIPPS INSTITUTION IS AMONG THE RESEARCH CENTERS THAT RELY 
HEAVILY ON MILITARY SUPPORT, BUT WORLD EVENTS PROMPT IT TO PLAN CHANGES TO FIT 
THE NEW GEOPOLITICAL REALITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whether on land or at sea, the 70 or so professors doing research at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography are always conscious of political events taking 
place in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But their attention is perhaps more focused than ever on the national debate 
surrounding the world's changing geopolitical equations and the future of U.S. 
defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanography -- a field central to the mission of the world-renowed University 
of California research facility in La Jolla, as well as a handful of similar 
research centers in the nation -- depends heavily on federal support. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy in particular has long supported basic ocean-related research in 
a unique 45-year relationship between the military and U.S. universities. A 
host of subjects -- from underwater sound propagation to chemical detection to 
plankton distribution -- owe their development in large part to funding from 
the Office of Naval Research. 
</P>
<P>
Although the National Science Foundation has come to the fore in national 
oceanographic funding during the past two decades, Navy support still accounts 
for almost a quarter of the annual $70-million Scripps budget. It encompasses 
faculty projects, even at times when the work has only minimal, and often 
unclear, relationships to military uses. 
</P>
<P>
Any substantial change in Navy dollars could ripple through the oceanographic 
communities in important ways, says Edward Frieman, director of Scripps, and 
affect not only specific research but the nation's ability to maintain an 
educational base considered critical to international competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
So far, top Navy researchers in Washington have attempted to minimize 
apprehension among the nation's oceanographers by maintaining existing funding 
and even augmenting proposed budgets, in large part because they know that the 
biggest beneficiary of basic ocean research is likely to be the ocean's biggest 
user. 
</P>
<P>
But both Scripps and Navy officials realize that long-term changes in support 
are inevitable and that plans must be drawn now for dealing with a new 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Scripps is a microcosm for the social trends influencing research over the 
next decade," Frieman said, noting that he spends a substantial amount of time 
with Washington officials, both in Congress and the Navy, either on the phone 
or in person. 
</P>
<P>
Frieman is well placed to influence the trend, having served as the assistant 
secretary for the Department of Energy from 1979 to 1981 as well as having 
chaired numerous government and national academic committees and study groups 
on science-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
Frieman sees a potentially severe threat to military funding, particularly if 
and when Congress is forced to choose between basic science research and 
closure of a military base or cancellation of a weapons system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to throw research overboard," Frieman warned. "There's no huge 
constituency for basic research in a (given) congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
"We envision the reality that there will be an inevitable decline in funding," 
he said, adding that he hopes it will be counterbalanced by new sources of 
support among a variety of government agencies, citing as one example new 
cooperative programs to study global warming. 
</P>
<P>
But officials in the Office of Naval Research are fighting hard to maintain 
their strong role in oceanographic areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud to brag that the Navy really has the oldest existing government 
enterprise to support basic research in this country," said Fred E. Saalfeld, 
director of the ONR. Until the National Science Foundation was set up in the 
early 1950s, the Navy and the Atomic Energy Commission (later to become the 
Department of Energy) were the major engines for government support of basic 
science. 
</P>
<P>
The ONR grew out of Navy academic links developed during World War II, when the 
Navy needed a lot of information quickly about a host of ocean-related 
problems, such as underwater sound propagation to protect submarines and surf 
conditions that could affect amphibious landings. Millions of dollars were 
pumped into the then-minor field of oceanography, including the then-quiescent 
Scripps facility on the La Jolla coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that, regarding the ocean sciences, despite the rather gloomy 
forecasts about the Department of Defense budgets, the Navy has taken a 
positive stance toward science and technology," Saalfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ONR budget for fiscal 1991 that was sent to Congress by President 
Bush calls for a 2% increase in real growth after inflation, a figure the 
office plans to maintain annually through 1995, Saalfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary of the Navy has said that we will protect the (nation's) 
technological base," Saalfeld said, adding that "we must support a core of very 
smart people in research so that, if there is a scientific breakthrough, we can 
exploit it quickly for the Navy and the country." The Navy funds the numerous 
oceanographic research vessels, including the Melville, based at Scripps Pier, 
that universities use for their deep-water programs. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the Navy's support of basic research at universities is 
unclassified. Classified applications of new or startling research takes place 
in Navy labs, such as the Naval Ocean Systems Center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we are going to fight very hard in Congress for this," Saalfeld said, 
"and while every year is a budget battle -- the results are always up to God 
and Congress -- I feel that we have considerable support on Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, ocean sciences will have the highest priority for the Navy, 
Saalfeld said, conceding that Navy support of projects in chemistry, physics, 
materials research and other fields related to oceanography might see less 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the trade-off you make when you manage science," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saalfeld said he predicts some critics of defense spending will ask why the 
Navy's support of basic research cannot be transfered to the National Science 
Foundation as part of the nation's so-called "peace dividend." 
</P>
<P>
The NSF tends to wait for proposals from individual scientists eager for 
funding, he said, while the Navy, through liaison offices it maintains at 
American universities, identifies areas in which it asks scientists to draw up 
potential projects. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, with Scripps we might try to stimulate proposals in acoustics or 
in ocean optics, in areas where the National Science Foundation might not get 
many proposals because the (subjects) may not be in the mainstream. We may be 
more willing to take risks on an idea." 
</P>
<P>
Saalfeld said he is particularly interested in stimulating more acoustical 
research at additional American universities after years of steady declines in 
the number of academic specialists. The Navy also wants more talent developed 
in ocean optics. 
</P>
<P>
Frieman agreed that continued Navy support is likely, although he is planning 
Scripps' future in anticipation of a reduced military role. 
</P>
<P>
"Oceanography and its strong relationship to the Navy's mission isn't going to 
go away," he said, "but my vision is that oceanography needs new partnerships, 
new agencies of support." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Frieman strongly endorses projects such as the interagency U.S. 
Global Change Research Program, a billion-dollar, multi-year effort to document 
earth sciences on a global scale. Frieman has positioned Scripps to emphasize 
global warming research, which is a significant portion of the global change 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that global warming is now getting an enormous amount of 
attention," Frieman said, noting with some irony that Roger Revelle, an early 
Scripps oceanographer and prime mover in the creation of UC San Diego, was one 
of the first scientists to document a possible warming trend as far back as 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
"And, while the public hears about this, they think about the atmosphere and 
don't understand that the role of oceans is enormous in controlling the weather 
and the environment," Frieman said. "To understand the greenhouse effect and 
global warming, we have to learn much more about the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Already, top officials from the Department of Energy and the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration have visited Scripps to talk about global 
warming research. The head of NOAA is a former Scripps graduate student.

$50,000 IN HOLOGRAMS STOLEN FROM EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities were searching for clues Sunday in the theft this weekend of eight 
rare holograms from a holography exhibit in Santa Monica, the second time in a 
year that pieces from the collection had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The holograms, valued at a total of $50,000, were part of a 70-piece exhibit 
titled "Images in Time and Space" that has been showcased for the last five 
weeks on the Santa Monica Third Street Promenade, said J. William McGowan, 
chairman of the board of Associates of Science and Technology, the coordinator 
of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica police could provide few details on the burglary. But McGowan said 
he believes that the theft occurred sometime between late Saturday night and 
early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
He called the crime a professional job, explaining that the thieves 
disconnected the exhibit's burglar alarm and used drills to unscrew the 
11-by-14-inch holograms from the walls. Last July, someone stole three 
holograms from the exhibit while it was on display in San Francisco. No one was 
arrested in the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew which ones they wanted and which ones to take," McGowan said of the 
latest theft. 'I just can't believe it. We are devastated." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit began four years ago when organizers decided to put together a 
collection of works that would spark public interest in holography, a 
photographic method that uses laser light to produce three-dimensional images. 
</P>
<P>
The holography exhibit on display in Santa Monica features works from 17 
countries and is part of a larger collection of 200 pieces, the largest in the 
world, McGowan said.

THEY SEIZE TEENS WHO TAKE DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
TREATMENT: A CANOGA PARK TRANSPORT FIRM TRACKS DOWN MISSING YOUTHS, ALTHOUGH IT 
LACKS A LICENSE. CLIENTS PRAISE IT. THE STATE HAS BEGUN A PROBE.

<P>
When their 15-year-old daughter ran away from their Simi Valley home in 1988 
after a history of cocaine use, Donald and Alice Soeder were frustrated and 
scared. 
</P>
<P>
They knew that Jane should be off the streets and in a drug-abuse program, but 
they had only a vague idea of where to find her, and no clue as to how to get 
her into treatment. 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of officials at Anacapa Adventist Hospital, a Port Hueneme drug 
treatment facility, the Soeders called S&amp;L Teen Hospital Shuttle, a Canoga 
Park firm that transports youths with drug problems, sometimes forcibly, to 
treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, using photographs of the girl and telephone records, the firm 
found Jane and drove her, bound by the hands and feet, to treatment, Alice 
Soeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after she completed her treatment at Anacapa, Jane and her parents 
have nothing but praise for S&amp;L. "There was no way that they by themselves 
could have gotten me," Jane Soeder said of her parents. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm has also drawn criticism from some drug treatment officials and 
attention from regulatory officials. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L operates as both a transport and an investigative service, those who 
have used the firm said. Sometimes the company simply drives stubborn youths 
with drug problems from their homes to treatment centers. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, those familiar with the firm say, it uses investigative 
techniques to locate addicted teens who have run away from home, then restrains 
the youths during the drive to rehabilitation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in response to inquiries by The Times, the California Department of 
Consumer Affairs' bureau of collection and investigative services began to 
investigate S&amp;L, said Gretchen Werry, the bureau's program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
There is no law prohibiting private citizens from helping parents to find and 
retrieve a runaway child, even if the effort requires them to use "reasonable 
force," said Dallas Binger, a consultant to the Los Angeles Police Department's 
juvenile narcotics unit. But anyone who does so as a business must be licensed 
for the task, Binger said. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L is authorized by the state to operate only as a transport service. It 
is registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, the agency that 
licenses businesses such as limousines, buses and airport shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
The firm is listed in the telephone book as a conventional ambulance service 
but is not licensed as such by the city, county or state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is S&amp;L licensed to conduct private investigative work. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Miller, who with Steven Sawhill owns and operates S&amp;L out of the 
couple's Canoga Park house, referred questions about the firm and the state 
investigation to their lawyer, Laurence H. Mandell. 
</P>
<P>
"They just transport kids that have drug problems because the parents can't do 
it for themselves," Mandell said. "They have their referrals, and things are 
working out good, and they'd just like to keep it at that." 
</P>
<P>
Mandell declined to discuss S&amp;L or the state's investigation in more 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Consumer Affairs last Tuesday sent S&amp;L a "cease and 
desist" letter, ordering the firm either to shut down permanently or to stop 
the investigative part of its work until it applies for and receives the proper 
state license, said Denise Grayson, the department investigator assigned to the 
S&amp;L case. 
</P>
<P>
Drug treatment officials had varying estimates of the proportion of S&amp;L 
cases that involve investigative work, ranging from 20% to 90%. 
</P>
<P>
In their application for a state transport permit, Sawhill and Miller 
identified themselves as an equal partnership under the name "SLTHS." They 
claimed five years of experience in the transport field, and described their 
business as "shuttling teen-agers and adults to requested destination." 
</P>
<P>
Lin Raistrick, Santa Clarita Valley representative for Toughlove, a nationwide 
counseling group for teen-age drug abusers and their parents, said Sawhill told 
her he began S&amp;L simply to help troubled teens receive help. 
</P>
<P>
Raistrick said Sawhill told her he once knew a teen-age girl with a drug 
problem who died after running away from home, and that as a result of the 
experience he decided, "I'm going to dedicate my life to this. I'm going to 
help these kids. I don't want any more to die." 
</P>
<P>
Drug treatment workers who have referred parents to S&amp;L said the firm's 
fees are based on the driving distance and time involved in locating and 
transporting each teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
One treatment worker said the fee averages $600 per case. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Lamb, administrator of Anacapa Adventist, a 48-bed juvenile psychiatric 
hospital in Port Hueneme that uses S&amp;L "a couple times a month," said 
S&amp;L's fee is not covered by patients' medical insurance. He said Anacapa, 
the facility to which S&amp;L brought Jane Soeder, pays the transport fees for 
the teen-agers it receives from S&amp;L, and does not pass those fees on to the 
youths' parents. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L is called in "only . . . upon the concurrence of the parents and the 
intake people and the admitting doctor," said Anacapa controller Mike Ogden. 
"So it's not, 'Go out and grab them.' It's a pretty reasoned process. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's like anything else -- unscrupulous things occur out there." 
</P>
<P>
Past S&amp;L customers said the firm's workers do not carry weapons, and that 
when they suspect they may confront violence in retrieving a teen-ager they 
contact the police for backup help. 
</P>
<P>
Customers and treatment centers that have used the firm said they knew of no 
instance in which S&amp;L injured a teen-ager who was under its care. Many 
praised the company as acting professionally and compassionately in an obscure 
and poorly regulated field where the potential for abuse is great. 
</P>
<P>
Some drug treatment experts took issue with the concept of forcing teen-agers 
to enter drug treatment centers. 
</P>
<P>
Others who work with adolescent drug abusers, however, argued that forced entry 
into a treatment program sometimes is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as simple as, 'They have to want the help to get it,' " said Jay 
Cavanaugh, president of the board of directors of Interagency Alcohol and Drug 
Rehabilitation Programs, a nonprofit group that runs four non-residential 
adolescent drug treatment centers throughout the Los Angeles area and that has 
used S&amp;L in the past. "There are a lot of times when the kids are very 
ill."

CANINES TAKE A BITE OUT OF JAIL WORKLOAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County jails have a common and troubling problem: too many inmates, 
too few jailers. 
</P>
<P>
During a typical shift at the Descanso honor farm, about 10 sheriff's deputies 
watch more than 400 inmates. At the Las Colinas Jail in Santee, about 30 
deputies and corrections officers oversee more than 1,000 male and female 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
To help even the odds, the Sheriff's Department has put some furry, four-legged 
friends on the job. The specially trained German shepherds last month began 
making rounds with deputies at the Las Colinas and Descanso jails. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the county's potentially dangerous inmates are sent to other 
facilities, and the dogs are stationed in Descanso and Santee partly for crowd 
control, said Mel Nichols, the county's commander of jail operations. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's 1 to 75 or so, every little bit helps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols hopes the animals will also excel at another part of their job 
description: hunting down escaped inmates in the rural areas around the two 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, there were three escapes and two 
attempted escapes at Las Colinas, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one escaped from Descanso during the first half of this year, one 
inmate tried to escape the first day the dogs were on duty in July, Nichols 
said. Officials did not have an opportunity to test the dogs' tracking ability, 
however, since the inmate was apprehended before he made it over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't really had an opportunity to put the dogs to use," said Ray Root, 
an administrative supervisor at Descanso. "We don't know what the effect will 
be." 
</P>
<P>
No other county in California uses dogs to assist jailers, but San Diego's 
experiment with the animals might lead others to try them as well, Nichols 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, particularly in Southern California, are watching this to see 
how it works out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Zinn, a field representative for the State Board of Corrections, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see whether or not it can make a difference," Zinn said. "San Diego 
County is plagued with chronic overcrowding and understaffing. . . . It could 
be that San Diego County is looking for a psychological edge over its inmates." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials think they have that edge with the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Mills, one of the dog handlers at Las Colinas, said inmates have 
given her a wide berth since she started patrolling with Argo, a 70-pound 
shepherd who stands about 5 feet tall on his hind legs. 
</P>
<P>
"When they see the dog, the movement stops," Mills said. "They're very leery of 
the dog. And they're very good about getting out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
That's just the effect deputies were hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
They are also hoping that the dogs will provide peace of mind for nearby 
residents, particularly at Las Colinas.

Some Santee residents protested vehemently before and after the men's section 
of Las Colinas opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of Santee had a concern about another jail going into their 
neighborhood," said Clay Reynard, program director at Las Colinas. "We hope the 
dogs will be a large deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the city said the new sentries probably won't be enough to 
completely quell community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several issues," said Bill Adams, the city's public information 
officer. "One of the main issues was public safety, and anything that can 
enhance public safety would be welcomed." 
</P>
<P>
For now, only three dogs are working at each facility, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs cost about $3,500 each; the total budget for this year's program is 
about $39,000, he said. Funding for the program came from money seized in drug 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to get this in effect for the past four years," Nichols 
said. "We didn't really have the money in the normal budget process." 
</P>
<P>
He was reluctant to discuss expanding the use of dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Next fiscal year -- we'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Nichols said.

2 TO BE NAMED FOR JORDAN RANCH TALKS

<P>
The Simi Valley City Council on Monday is scheduled to appoint two of its 
members to meet with Thousand Oaks officials to discuss which of the two cities 
is the more logical choice to annex entertainer Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Thousand Oaks City Council voted to delegate Councilmen 
Lawrence E. Horner and Frank Schillo to meet with Simi Valley officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Heitzman, Simi Valley deputy city manager, said Friday that no dates have 
been set for talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council voted July 30 to ask county planners if annexation 
of Hope's Jordan Ranch is feasible for the city, but Mayor Greg Stratton has 
suggested that it might be more practical for nearby Thousand Oaks to annex the 
2,308-acre parcel because it could more easily provide services for the planned 
750-unit housing development and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Simi Valley is separated from the ranch by a series of hills to the 
south, which would make it difficult for the city to provide services to the 
area, considered essential for annexation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his Jordan Ranch property, Hope has asked the city of Simi 
Valley to annex 3,495 acres of his Runkle Ranch property to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Hope officials said the Simi Valley annexation proposal was prompted by 
concerns that the Ventura County Board of Supervisors would reject the Jordan 
Ranch development project. CARLOS LOZANO

<P>
A neighbor is protesting a Fillmore Planning Commission decision to allow 
expansion of a concrete pipe manufacturing company in the North Fillmore 
Industrial Park. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will hear the appeal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Boren, whose property is north of the site, is appealing a July 5 decision 
by the Planning Commission allowing Hurst Concrete Products to expand a pipe 
storage yard north of its plant. As part of the expansion, truck shipments will 
leave the yard 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Roy Payne said Hurst's request to operate around the clock was 
prompted by a Los Angeles County proposal to ban heavy trucks from freeways 
during peak traffic hours. Payne said the matter may be referred back to the 
Planning Commission for further study, but the city staff has recommended that 
the council uphold the decision. "All the concerns about noise, dust and 
lighting have been addressed," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
While other residents initially asked the Planning Commission to deny Hurst's 
request, Payne said Boren was the only one to appeal the decision. JANET

FDA OKS CLINICAL TRIALS OF SALIVA-BASED AIDS TEST

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week approved national clinical 
trials of a saliva-based AIDS diagnostic test, according to Epitope Inc., the 
company that developed the test. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first widespread testing of a saliva-based procedure to detect the 
presence of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS tests now detect HIV antibodies in blood serum, exposing health care 
workers to potential HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
Testing of about 4,000 people began immediately at five U.S. medical centers. 
If successful, the test will be used in hospitals and clinics. Eventually the 
potential exists for an in-home AIDS test, much like the pregnancy tests now 
sold over the counter in U.S. drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
The device consists of a cotton-like pad impregnated with a preservative that 
"absorbs antibodies." The pad, which projects from a handle that is shaped much 
like a bent toothbrush, is held in the mouth between the gums and cheek for 
about two minutes. The pad then is sealed in a tube and sent to a laboratory.

GENE MAY GIVE INSIGHT TO CANCER

Utah researchers have shown that the gene that causes neurofibromatosis belongs 
to a family of genes that suppress tumor formation. The new discovery, reported 
last week in the journal Cell, indicates that research on the gene will provide 
not only information useful for treating neurofibromatosis but also new 
insights into the mechanisms by which cancer occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Neurofibromatosis is the most common nervous system defect caused by a single 
gene defect. It affects one out of every 3,500 people, causing symptoms that 
range from brownish skin lesions to massive, deforming tumors called 
neurofibromas, seizures and fatal tumors of the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
The identification and cloning of the gene that causes the disorder was 
reported barely three weeks ago. "We didn't expect to have the protein produced 
by the gene for another 12 to 24 months," said Peter Bellerman of the National 
Neurofibromatosis Foundation. "Now we have it. It's a tremendous leap forward." 
</P>
<P>
Geneticist Ray White and his colleagues at the University of Utah found that 
the protein produced by the gene suppresses the activity of certain oncogenes 
-- naturally occurring genes that lead to cancer. Knowing its identity, he 
predicted, would allow researchers to synthesize chemicals that could both 
block tumor formation and prevent the growth of neurofibromas.

A combination of antibiotics taken after intercourse appears to be highly 
effective in preventing urinary tract infections among women prone to such 
disorders, researchers reported last week. The drugs involved are commonly sold 
under the trade names Bactrim and Septra. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle said they tested a group 
of women who had suffered at least two urinary tract infections in the 
preceding year. Some were given tablets made of 40 milligrams of trimethoprim 
and 200 milligrams of sulfamethoxazole, while others were given inactive 
placebos. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of 16 women in the group given the drugs developed another infection, 
compared to nine of 11 who were given the placebo, the researchers reported in 
the Journal of the American Medical Assn.

SICKLE CELL DRUG HOLDS PROMISE

<TEXT>
<P>
A new treatment for sickle-cell anemia -- a drug that reduces the anemia and 
helps prevent the painful "crises" that mark the disease -- has shown promise 
in a small, preliminary study of three patients with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
In people with sickle-cell anemia, red blood cells contain an abnormal form of 
hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein, that can distort cells from their 
normal bagel shape into a crescent or sickle shape, making them unusually 
fragile and often leading to painful blockages of blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
A report in last week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine shows that 
the drug, hydroxyurea, can improve the survival of red blood cells and reduce 
pain in people with the disease. About 50,000 Americans have sickle-cell 
anemia. 
</P>
<P>
The drug works by increasing the body's production of another form of 
hemoglobin that is normally produced during fetal life. 
</P>
<P>
Hydroxyurea has been used for about 15 years to treat chronic leukemia and 
other blood disorders sometimes seen in elderly people. The report's authors 
said they were excited by the findings, but cautioned that before hydroxyurea 
becomes widely used for sickle-cell anemia, their results should be confirmed 
in a much larger, multihospital study that would compare the drug with a 
placebo. 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by researchers at Harvard and Johns Hopkins medical 
schools.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STORE EVACUATED AFTER MALATHION JAR BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canyon Country hardware store was evacuated Sunday and one of its employees 
hospitalized after a jar containing a quart of malathion was knocked off its 
shelf and broke on the floor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 30 shoppers in the Builders Emporium store at 19407 Soledad Canyon Road 
were evacuated when the liquid pesticide spilled about 2:45 p.m. Sunday, said 
Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Ron Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
The store remained closed for the rest of the day and was scheduled to open as 
usual this morning, said Gary Kaplinger, the store's assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
The jar of malathion was knocked off its shelf inadvertently by a customer, 
said Mike Wronkowski, a second assistant store manager. 
</P>
<P>
Store employees immediately neutralized the spilled liquid using other 
chemicals and placed the pesticide in double plastic bags, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Two cashiers working nearby told firefighters they felt ill after the spill, 
Patterson said. One of the cashiers, Robin Feldman, 29, of Canyon Country, 
asked to be taken by ambulance to Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, where she was 
treated for exposure to chemical vapors and released at 4:45 p.m., a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The other cashier said she didn't need to go to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-ounce jar of Ortho brand Malathion-50, intended to be sprayed on lawns, 
yields 192 gallons of insecticide when mixed with water.

A Canyon Country woman died of a heart attack Sunday afternoon after losing 
control of her car while suffering chest pains, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old woman, whose name was not released pending notification of her 
relatives, was driving south on Sand Canyon Road in Santa Clarita about 1:45 
p.m. when her car ran off the road and crashed into a ditch, said Sgt. Steve 
Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told deputies who arrived after the accident that her chest pains 
made it impossible for her to control her car, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was rushed by ambulance to Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, where she 
died at 3 p.m. of a heart attack, a hospital spokeswoman said. The victim had a 
history of heart trouble, the spokeswoman said.

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS GRIECO -- 7 TIMES

<P>
Maybe they should have made it like a horse race. Maybe they should have added 
some weight to Jessica Grieco's bike before she entered the road race for 16-17 
year-old girls at the U.S. Cycling Federation Junior Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, maybe they should have made Grieco wear the six gold medals that 
she had won in the previous seven days of competition so that she wouldn't have 
been such a heavy favorite to win her seventh. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Grieco completed the 28-mile course on Sorrento Mesa in 1:21:18 -- 
one minute and 11 seconds ahead of the next rider -- and became the first 
junior cyclist ever to sweep all seven events. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike that of Eric Harris, who clinched the gold on the final sprint of the 
boys' 17-18 race, Grieco's victory was not contained in a fleeting moment. 
</P>
<P>
It was apparent she would win with one 3.5-mile lap to go when she began 
pulling away from a four-cyclist break. For an entire lap, she knew that 
victory was her's. 
</P>
<P>
But after eight days of riding, Grieco was not ready to savor anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just relaxed," she said of her final lap. "It was a long week." 
</P>
<P>
It started July 5 with a gold medal for winning the criterium. Over the next 
four days, she was draped with four more gold medals for winning the four 
velodrome events. On Friday, she placed first in the individual time trial. Six 
down, one to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win everything," she said. "And I felt I had a chance if I rode 
well. My goal has always been to be an all-around rider; I've always wanted to 
do everything." 
</P>
<P>
Now Grieco must come up with some new goals. 
</P>
<P>
Top on her list is a gold medal at next year's Junior Worlds. She won four 
silvers this year, but to improve on that, Grieco needs a rule change. On 
Friday she turned 17. At 18, girls become senior riders. But there is talk of 
aligning with the boys, and keeping 18-year-old girls in the junior ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Grieco, of Emerson, N.J., isn't going to wait for next summer, though. She's 
going to align with the boys this week at Tour of the Future, a six-stage, 
four-day race in Bisbee, Ariz. for junior boys. Grieco was invited to ride, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, of Colorado Springs, finished the 62-mile boys' 17-18 course in 
2:36:27, just ahead of a pack of five: David Francis, Teton, Idaho; Kevin 
Livingston, Glencoe, Mo.; Nathan Long, Lima, Ohio; Greg Strock, Anderson, Ohio; 
and Jon Vaughters, Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston, Long and Strock were in a group of riders who led from the sixth 
lap on and held as much as a one-minute, 15-second lead over the field. 
</P>
<P>
But with four laps to go, Harris and Vaughters decided to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
"George Hincappie made this awesome attack, and everybody chased it down," 
Harris said. "Right after that, (Vaughters and I) started a chase and no one 
countered it." 
</P>
<P>
They closed a gap of a minute in just over a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"When we caught (the leaders), I knew they were dead," Harris said. "But we 
just used them to get to the finish." 
</P>
<P>
A lead pack works together by drafting off one another. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughters, however, felt somewhat betrayed, having done much of the work that 
kept the break ahead of the field, only to be spent at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a sprinter," he said. "And every time I tried to get away, Eric Harris 
reeled me in." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Meilicke of Santa Rosa won the boy's 15-16 race by inches over San 
Diego's Vincent Ones. Meilicke finished the 31-mile course in 1:19:53.

You're best performance in a while, Mark Vlasic? 
</P>
<P>
A quick laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"My first performance in a while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Vlasic, the Charger's No. 2 quarterback, played in a real game 
for the first time since he went down with a knee injury Nov. 20, 1988 against 
the Rams. Last season, his contributions were confined to the sidelines, where 
he impressed Coach Dan Henning with his ability to learn the game plan and help 
with the signals. 
</P>
<P>
"He handled it like a career coach," Henning said. "He has a great temperament. 
He doesn't lose his concentration. He has a steadying effect on the players 
around him." 
</P>
<P>
One other thing, too. The guy can play. Saturday, spelling starter Billy Joe 
Tolliver in the second half, Vlasic completed 11 of 13 passes for 135 yards and 
a touchdown in the Chargers' 28-16 victory over Dallas. No interceptions, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
So is there a quarterback controversy around the bend? 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to practice and prepare the way we started training camp," 
Henning said. "(We will) try to prepare Billy to start and get as much work as 
we can for Mark." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Tolliver didn't hurt his cause, completing nine of 15 passes for 108 
yards with no interceptions. But Henning sees plenty of room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"He is nowhere near where we want him to be and nowhere near where he wants to 
be," he said. "He wants to be a first-rate NFL quarterback. He played better in 
that game than he has in any practice or any scrimmage up to now, which is the 
way we hope it works because we put a great deal more strain on him in 
practice. We don't hold back anything." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he may start John Friesz, the Chargers' rookie quarterback, 
Saturday night against the Rams in Anaheim. Friesz didn't play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Richard Brown, a former San Diego State player who played in 1987 
and 1989 for the Rams, looked strong Saturday, making three tackles and sacking 
Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman for a six-yard loss in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said last week that he will either make this team or give up football. 
</P>
<P>
"And he plays like it," Henning said. "There's nobody that works harder and is 
more focused at practicing hard to do the things that we're asking him to do. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough guy. He's a great guy to have out there. Some of these guys don't 
even want to be around him that much. He's no fun right now. It looks like if 
you get close to him he may just freak out and deck you. And I like that. I 
give him a wide berth, though." 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith (bruised thigh) and cornerback Gill Byrd 
(fluid on the knee) suffered minor injuries in Saturday's game. Henning said 
both will probably miss practice this week and may miss Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"You never like to see anybody injured," Henning said. "But two guys that can 
afford to miss the work and come back and pick it up quickly when they're 
healthy are Billy Ray and Gill." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that was the Dallas Cowboys, worst team in the NFL last season, but, 
nonetheless, Henning was pleasantly surprised with the sharpness of his team's 
first performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We had very few missed assignments," he said. "We didn't have any turnovers. 
We played a sound, solid football game. I'd say it was better than I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Inside linebacker Cedric Figaro and tight end Andy Parker are still out with 
injuries they suffered during a fight in Thursday's practice. Figaro has an 
ankle sprain with soreness on the top of his foot and Parker has loose teeth 
that had to be wired after the fight. Henning said Parker won't participate in 
contact drills today, and Figaro will likely be held out of practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys will be practicing with the Chargers today and Tuesday at UCSD 
before leaving town Thursday night.

SCOTT-HERON LEAPS 11 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
During the 1970s, Gil Scott-Heron applied his satiric wit to the nation. He 
wrote opinionated songs he half sang and half chanted in a rhythmic style that 
made him a forerunner of today's rappers. He sold albums. 
</P>
<P>
But it's almost as if Scott-Heron vanished from Earth around 1979. That's when 
the "Reader's Guide to Periodic Literature" last mentioned him, citing a review 
in Downbeat, the national jazz magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Scott-Heron a "funk-folk minstrel," the magazine's writer went on to 
say that Scott-Heron, keyboardist Brian Jackson and their Midnight Band could 
"light the urban fire in the remotest of locales." 
</P>
<P>
Jump ahead 11 years. Scott-Heron, 41, is rekindling those flames with something 
called the Amnesia Express, due in San Diego tonight and Tuesday for 8:30 and 
10:30 shows at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
"The Amnesia Express started after the Midnight Band closed up," said 
Scott-Heron, who lives in Alexandria, Va. "When Brian decided to go out and do 
his own thing, I started the Amnesia Express with (saxophonist and former 
Midnight Band member) Carl Cornwell in 1980 or '81." (Cornwell is no longer 
with the group.) 
</P>
<P>
Scott-Heron's last release in this country was the 1984 single "We Don't Need 
No Rerun," an election-year commentary on the idea of re-electing Ronald 
Reagan, not recorded with the Amnesia Express. His last American album was a 
compilation of 1970s material titled "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," 
released four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I continued to perform, but this group is interested in doing live material. 
Most of the U.S. recording companies are looking for studio projects." 
</P>
<P>
So the live-oriented Amnesia Express has never released any music in the United 
States. A live album ("The Tales of Gil Scott-Heron and his Amnesia Express") 
came out in Europe last fall, and a single ("Space Shuttle") was released there 
in February. A U.S. distribution deal for the album is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Scott-Heron plans to play some of his best-known Midnight Band songs, plus a 
variety of Amnesia Express material, in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we haven't done a lot of recording, and much of my recorded material has 
been discontinued, the letters we get are from people who want to hear the 
songs that made us important when we were doing most of the recording: 'Winter 
in America,' 'Johannesburg.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new songs sound promising. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Space Shuttle' " has to do with expending money for weapons of war as 
opposed to some things that would benefit people. What we found out was, since 
the space shuttle launchings, there's been a drastic change in the weather." 
Scott-Heron laughed. "We tried to hook up the weatherman with the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"We could do, 'Beam Me Up, There's No Intelligent Life Down Here.' We wrote 
that quite a while ago, but never recorded it. 
</P>
<P>
"Or, 'You May Not Be in a Class by Yourself, But It Don't Take Long to Call the 
Roll" -- for women who think more of themselves than we do. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've done, even in the case of older material, is re-arrange it to where 
we feel it'll be a new experience even for those who are familiar with our 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," his cynical 1971 look at how blacks are 
treated in America, became his first radical anthem. Starting with the "Pieces 
of a Man" album in 1971, including that song, Scott-Heron began his 
collaboration with Jackson. Their popularity crested in 1974 with the "Winter 
in America" album, which sold more than 300,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Scott-Heron recorded several more albums together, but these are 
difficult or impossible to find in music stores. However, all of his 1970s work 
is soon to be re-released on CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his music career, Scott-Heron is a poet and fiction writer, with a 
master's degree in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
His first novel, a mystery titled "The Vulture," was published in 1970, and he 
followed with a volume of poetry titled "125th and Lennox." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 1, a new book of poetry titled "So Far, So Good" is due in bookstores, 
published by Third World Press in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The title refers to the fact that we started off with a very difficult row to 
hoe and managed to survive. We, meaning us black artists. To be pro-black is 
not to be anti-white. With my background, it would be very difficult to be 
anti-anything," Scott-Heron said, referring to his late father, who was a 
Jamaican soccer player and his stepmother, who was born in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
With his long history of sniping at America, you might not expect Scott-Heron 
to hold much hope for the nation, but he is surprisingly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people who were not open-minded in the '60s are still not 
open-minded, but I think society has changed a great deal for the positive. 
There is more understanding between everybody. Those who learned to communicate 
in the '60s are having a positive effect on young people. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as old people, who never wanted the communication in the first place, 
they're still the folks who run things. But a lot of young folks have come to 
see a positive side of communications."

GREG WHO? AUSTRALIA'S GRADY WINS PGA BY THREE STROKES;

<P>
The other Australian won the 1990 PGA Championship Sunday. His name is Wayne 
Grady, not to be confused with his more celebrated countryman, Greg Norman, 
whose exotic nickname, seven-digit earnings and gleaming smile are known 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But now they have at least something else in common: an equal number of major 
championships -- one. Grady won his while Norman, who had finished earlier in 
the day, was airborne in his private jet. Nationalism being what it is, Norman 
even phoned the Shoal Creek media building from his plane in search of a Grady 
update. 
</P>
<P>
"How's my mate doing?" said Norman, who also had left a note in Grady's locker 
before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Told that Grady led Fred Couples by three strokes with only a hole left to be 
played, Norman became a cheerleader at 20,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, tell him to go get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grady, who led by two strokes after Saturday's round, did just that. He plunked 
his drive to the middle of the 18th fairway, knocked a seven-iron to the center 
of the green and two-putted for a par and a championship. A bit unsure as to 
what to do next, he hugged his playing partner Payne Stewart, the defending PGA 
winner, who told him, "Congratulations. This is going to change your life." 
Grady then hugged his caddie and stood there, numbed by it all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the longest day in my life," he said. "It just seemed to go on and on 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
Only about 24 hours earlier, Grady had predicted that if he shot under par 
during the final round, he would be a difficult person to beat. He was right. 
His one-under 71 and 282 tournament total placed him comfortably ahead of 
Couples (par 72, 285) and Gil Morgan (par 72, 286). No one else was even close. 
Only only three of the 74 players left from the cut finished below par. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who trailed Grady by two shots at day's start, was only a slight 
factor by the fifth hole, when he dropped six strokes back. Any chance of a 
miracle finish ended at No. 11, when he took eight strokes to play the 516-yard 
par-five hole. He finished with a 79. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, at least I broke 80," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Next to falter was Morgan, who was within two strokes of the lead when he 
recorded a double bogey on No. 13, a 195-yard par three. An errant tee shot 
into a greenside bunker was "the biggest mistake of the tournament," Morgan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He bogeyed No. 16, parred Nos. 17 and 18 "and then threw up." 
</P>
<P>
Couples' decline was much more dramatic. As did Stewart, he trailed Grady by 
only two shots entering Sunday's round. Couples whittled the lead to one stroke 
after nine holes and overtook Grady with a birdie on No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
But then he bogeyed the next four holes, missing demanding but makeable short 
putts on three of them. A one-stroke Couples lead became a three-stroke 
deficit. "It just happened so fast, it's kind of sickening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grady needed only to avoid disaster to win. Of course, that is easier said than 
done. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than a year ago, Grady had begun the fourth round of the British 
Open at Troon with a lead. He stretched it to three strokes after five holes 
but bogeyed Nos. 10, 14 and 17, was forced into a playoff and lost. The 
experience, though dulled partially by time, was evident Sunday at Shoal Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I hit my second shot on the 18th green, I didn't allow myself get ahead 
of things," Grady said. "I was very disappointed with the British Open last, 
although I didn't let it affect me." 
</P>
<P>
Grady later revised his comments, acknowledging that Sunday's round was 
especially trying "because of the memory of Troon." 
</P>
<P>
He had his chances to fold under pressure. After sinking a 60-foot birdie putt 
on the first hole, he stepped up to the No. 2 tee, pulled out a three-wood and 
shanked his shot into a tree 40 yards away. Bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Grady made his way back to seven-under, where he stayed until No. 
12. A bogey, combined with Couples' birdie, temporarily pushed Grady out of the 
lead. "That was starting to put pressure on (me)," he said. "I thought, 'Here 
we go again.' But then (Couples) helped me out." 
</P>
<P>
This is Grady's second victory since joining the tour six years ago. It has 
been a career often eclipsed by Norman, who belonged to the same club in 
Queensland, Australia, as Grady. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Norman became ranked the No. 1 player in the world. Grady simply 
tried to stay out of the shade of Norman's considerable shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Now they each own a major championship, a fact not entirely lost on Grady. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it doesn't make me as good as Greg," Grady said. "I've got as many 
majors as he has, but he's won 55 other tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
But Grady will take tour win victory No. 2 and cherish it, the $225,000 first 
prize and an engraved place on the PGA Championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . There are some great players on this (PGA Championship) trophy," he 
said. "And no matter how hard you scratch that thing, you're not going to get 
my name off it." 
</P>
<P>
PGA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo shot Sunday's low round of 69, but still finished 13 total strokes 
behind Wayne Grady. Now comes news that he has played the last several months 
with sore wrists. He said he will have a specialist look at them today. "I need 
to rest them," he said. "They're just stressed out, that's all there is." Asked 
to comment on his week, he said, "Blah. I'm glad it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Payne Stewart, whose ball landed next to a tree on No. 12, had to listen to ABC 
commentator Bob Rosburg tell a national television audience that the only shot 
he had was hitting it left-handed. Stewart turned around and said, "That's 
right, Bob. That is the only shot I have."

Sam Perkins said he was prepared to stay with the Dallas Mavericks until the 
team sent him a letter wishing him good luck with his new team. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Mavericks offered him a six-year, $18 million deal, Perkins joined 
the Lakers last week. 
</P>
<P>
He said the rift that developed between himself and Dallas management was too 
great to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The last straw, he told the Dallas Morning News, was a letter he received Aug. 
2 from Norm Sonju, the club's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA salary cap increased Aug. 1. One of four teams -- Perkins wouldn't say 
which one, but it wasn't the Lakers -- offered him a six-year, $20-million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told to match the offer. That was our only option," said Sonju, who 
wished Perkins the best if he joined another team.

GRAF SWEEPS MALEEVA TO WIN 50TH SINGLES TITLE;

SAN DIEGO TENNIS: AFTER RECOVERING FROM SURGERY, THE WEST GERMAN HAS WON TWO 
CONSECUTIVE TOURNAMENTS GOING INTO THE U.S. OPEN.

Sinus surgery has made it easier for Steffi Graf to breath in more ways than 
one. It has seemed to clear her mind as well. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Graf won her 50th career singles title Sunday at the San Diego 
Tennis &amp; Racquet Club, defeating fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva, 6-3, 6-2, 
in the $225,000 Great American Bank tennis tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
Since her semifinal loss to Zina Garrison at Wimbledon, much ado has been made 
about everything Graf has said, but particularly about what she hasn't said. 
</P>
<P>
Her personal problems, stemming from her father's alleged liaisons with a 
model, were reported by some tabloids as the reason she abruptly left Wimbledon 
and returned briefly to her home in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Graf has said all along that surgery was the lone reason for her sudden flight. 
Her recent performances would seem to support her contentions that she feeling 
better as a result of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said she has benefited from the surgery and pronounced herself fit for the 
U.S. Open, her next competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I definitely feel much better," she said. "That's why I had surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Pavel Slozil, Graf's coach, said her play has improved since surgery, but the 
most dramatic change has been in her attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"It's especially good," Slozil said, "and it's important because now she 
believes she can play good tennis again." 
</P>
<P>
He said Graf's problems -- she also injured her thumb earlier in the year and 
sat out two tournaments -- are becoming things of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a lot of problems before," Slozil said. "Finally, most of them are 
behind her." 
</P>
<P>
And fading from Graf's memory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been said that after the last couple of (tournaments) that I'm not as 
strong as before," she said, "but if you know what I've gone through the last 
couple of months, you know why it's not easy to come back, and you understand 
it a little better if you think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Against Maleeva, she looked liked the old Graf. Her trademark power forehand 
sizzled and she never let Maleeva get into the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I was holding back on some shots," Maleeva said, "and not going for the 
winners. This was the difference." 
</P>
<P>
But she was pleased with her showing in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy overall," she said. "I played some good tennis this week. It 
gives me some confidence, this tournament. I played some good matches this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Said Graf: "I pretty much knew what to expect. It's up to me to be aggressive 
and not let her get into the match." 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva said her right shoulder was hurting a little, but not enough to make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit slow, a little tired from playing a semifinal match late 
last night," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory in San Diego gives Graf back-to-back singles titles. She won 
the Canadian Open Aug. 5 in Montreal. Her next competition is the U.S. Open in 
Flushing Meadow, N.Y., but she will appear in an exhibition, along with 
Jennifer Capriati, in Mahwah, N.J., Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
She said this tournament and Canada were good warmups for the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played two tournaments in a row," she said. "And I think playing those 10 
matches gave me a lot of experience and gave me the kind of match practice I 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
Graf's record is 279-11, and three losses have come this year. Her 50 singles 
titles has been surpassed only by Chris Evert's 157 and Martina Navratilova's 
152. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Graf celebrates her third anniversary as the No. 1 player in the world, 
and on Aug. 27, she will break Navratilova's record of 157 weeks at the top of 
the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
But what do titles, ranking and records all mean to Graf? 
</P>
<P>
"When I think about it," she said, "I enjoy looking at them. Those kinds of 
things are nice to look at, but I just keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva said it will be difficult for Graf to stay at the top much longer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to say for how long," she said, "because (Monica) Seles is 
playing well, (Gabriela) Sabatini is playing well and Martina (Navratilova) is 
playing well, so everyone is getting much closer." 
</P>
<P>
The $45,000 first-prize money increased Graf's earnings this year to $814,941, 
passing Seles, who has $788,696, to move into second among the tour's money 
winners. Although ranked second behind Graf, Navratilova is No. 1 in prize 
money, with $900,384. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova could have moved closer to the million-dollar mark had she not 
withdrawn from this tournament early in the week.

MORNING BRIEFING: LITTLE LEAGUE TRIES TO SHOW A BIGGER HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little League officials in Williamsport, Pa., have decided to follow their 
noses for public relations. And their hearts. . . . well, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
In December, they denied a souvenir uniform to Matt Sewell, a member of the 
Trumbull, Conn., team that won last year's Little League World Series. Matt had 
not played in the World Series games. 
</P>
<P>
For seven months, Trumbull Coach Tom Galla argued without success that Sewell, 
despite being injured shortly before the World Series, had been a team leader 
during the playoffs and deserved a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Little League headquarters relented. 
</P>
<P>
Little League public relations director Steve Keener told Paul Doyle of the 
Hartford Courant: "We were contacted by people from all over the country and we 
sensed that something was wrong. People were not going to leave this alone. The 
only way to resolve this was to give the youngster the uniform." 
</P>
<P>
Add Little League: Sewell's supporters included King center Wayne Gretzky, who 
heard of the incident on a Los Angeles radio talk show. Maury Povich also 
covered it on television's "A Current Affair." 
</P>
<P>
But the clincher came Friday morning, when an all-sports radio station in New 
York interviewed Galla, followed by Matt and his father two hours later. The 
station broadcast the phone number of Little League headquarters, and the final 
deluge was on. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: How many Olympic gold medals has Mark Spitz won? 
</P>
<P>
Called shot: After Oakland Athletic center fielder Dave Henderson had three 
runs batted in Thursday during the A's 5-2 victory over Baltimore, he said: 
"Put me in a game that's 10-1, and I'll be one of the worst players out there." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the A's defeated the Yankees, 10-1. Henderson was hitless in five 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Erie Wave of the World Basketball League has placed Soviet Karlis Muiznieks 
on its taxi squad and activated 6-foot-2 reserve guard Chris Hollan -- but not 
on the strength of Hollan's six points and three assists in 19 minutes of 
playing time in two games earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hernan, Wave general manager, told the Associated Press: "Chris deserves to 
be activated for the rest of the season. (He) has done so much for us in the 
area of player appearances at community and charity events. He has shown that 
he is truly a great role model for Erie-area kids. 
</P>
<P>
"As for his basketball abilities, Chris has been a model practice player for 
the entire season and now it's time for him to be given a chance to show 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
I do, I don't have to: Kansas City Royal outfielder Jim Eisenreich got a base 
hit in his last at-bat as a bachelor Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, his wedding reception at the Royals Stadium Club ended on schedule, 
and Eisenreich was able to change out of his tuxedo and report to the dugout in 
full uniform . . . only to find that he had been left out of the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenreich told AP: "If I'd known Duke (Manager John Wathan) was going to give 
me a game off, I'd have asked for Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Nine. Spitz won two in Mexico City in 1968 and seven in Munich 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Boston Red Sox outfielder Tom Brunansky, during a slump in which he 
was hitless in 34 at-bats: "If I get a hit, I might stop the game and ask for 
the ball." TED BROCK

Shoal Creek, at the center of the racial controversary that led to a change in 
the way future tournament sites will be selected, has bid to be the host of the 
1996 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not the only club that's asked for that year," Robert T. Sommers, U.S. 
Golf Assn. official, said Sunday, but did not reveal the other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Shoal Creek controversy, before the PGA Championship, was ignited by Hall 
Thompson's statement that the club he founded would not be pressured into 
accepting black members. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek awarded an honorary membership to Louis Willie, a black Birmingham 
executive, and derailed plans of demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers said the controversy would not affect the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA Tour announced this week that clubs selected as future sites for 
tournaments must have open membership practices. U.S. Open sites have been 
selected through 1995.

PUTTER POWERS RODRIGUEZ PAST $3-MILLION LEVEL

<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez, putting better than at any time in his career, had eight 
birdies en route to a four-under-par 68 Sunday and won the Sunwest Bank Senior 
tournament at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who began the day one shot behind Charles Coody and Joe Jimenez, 
birdied four of the first six holes as he overcame a double-bogey and two 
bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez finished the 54-hole tournament at 11-under-par 205, two shots ahead 
of Jim Ferree, Jim Dent and Coody. Ferree and Dent both shot 68, while Coody 
shot 71. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's second shot on the 427-yard final hole found the left bunker and 
Coody hit a six-iron through the trees to within 20 feet. Rodriguez left his 
sand shot short, but Coody's birdie attempt slid by. Rodriguez then sank the 
par putt. 
</P>
<P>
George Archer (68), Robert Betley (69) and Larry Mowry (70) finished four shots 
back at 209. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, the third this season for Rodriguez, was worth $52,500 and 
increased his earnings for the year to $458,796. His career earnings are 
$3,001,272, making him the ninth player to reach the $3 million level. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Gerring birdied the first playoff hole to beat Caroline Keggi in the LPGA 
Stratton Mountain (Vt.) Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Gerring and Keggi, who each started the day two shots out of the lead, shot 
four-under-par 68s to gain the playoff at 281, two strokes clear of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Gerring, one of the longer hitters on the tour, then hit an iron out of the 
rough about 165 yards from the green to within three feet of the cup on the 
first playoff hole. Keggi's iron rolled up to a spectator stand and, after a 
free drop, she chipped to within two feet. 
</P>
<P>
But Gerring, 29, rolled in her putt to win a playoff for the first time in four 
tries in six years on the tour. Her other victory this season was in the Lady 
Keystone, and she also finished second in another tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Benz, who shared the third-round lead with Karen Davies, had a chance to 
get into the playoff heading to the 18th hole. But Benz hit an approach shot 
into a trap on the way to a double bogey and a round of 73. Davies shot a 76. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Hurst of San Jose State rallied from three holes down after the morning 18, 
caught Stephanie Davis in the afternoon and then won the U.S. Women's Amateur 
title with a conceded par on the 37th hole at Summit, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst's victory came a year after the 1989 NCAA champion lost in the first 
round of match play after winning medalist honors in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, 21, of San Leandro, Calif., had come into the 36-hole final at 13-under 
in five matches and with victories over defending champion Vicki Goetze and 
French Amateur champion Delphine Bourson.

WATER SKIING: COLTON'S MARTIE WELLS OVERCOMES PROBLEMS TO WIN 62-MILE CATALINA 
COMPETITION BY 32 SECONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Martie Wells of Colton survived dropping his tow line and following the wrong 
boat Sunday but recovered in time to win the 62-mile Catalina Water Ski Race 
from Long Beach to Avalon and back. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, 28, finished 32 seconds ahead of Darren Kirkland of England. 
</P>
<P>
The winning time was 1 hour 1 minute .09 seconds. Defending champion Kurt 
Schoen of Mesa, Ariz., who led at the halfway mark, finished third, followed by 
Corey Cook of Rowland Heights, Gary Tomlin of Long Beach and Mark Pickering of 
Australia. It was the first victory in three tries for Wells and driver Jim 
Duvall of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I let go of the handle about halfway over and we probably lost five minutes 
stopping and getting going again," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when we got under way, we were in such a hurry to catch up that we 
started following Bill Dunsmore's boat (pulling Pickering) and it took us a 
while to realize he was heading way too far to the right. By the time Jim 
(Duvall) and Mark (observer Mark Hoffmeyer) got us back on course again, we'd 
dropped a couple of more positions." 
</P>
<P>
Wells was fifth when he rounded the turn boat outside Avalon harbor, but Duvall 
picked up the pace on the return trip despite some rough water that bothered 
the other skiers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were about a mile behind the lead boat when we started back, but we 
just kept pushing as hard as we could," Wells said. "When we passed Corey Cook 
I figured we had it if nothing bad happened after we got inside the breakwater. 
There were so many boats it was like a washboard until we passed the corner of 
the Queen Mary and saw the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
Wells, a general contractor, finished third overall last year when he also won 
the novice class. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Dunsmore of Lomita, who trains with Wells on the Colorado River, won the 
women's overall championship in her sixth try. Dunsmore's time of 1:06.56, 
behind driver Mike Drews of Lomita, was ninth fastest overall and nearly seven 
minutes faster than Shelbey Guardalabene of Azusa and three-time defending 
champion Rose Johnson of Oakley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our problems, too, but luckily for me I didn't know about them until 
after we crossed the finish line," Dunsmore said. 
</P>
<P>
Her boat's transmission locked up with about 30 miles to go and then the power 
steering went out. Drews had to steer the boat by alternating power from his 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the hatch open and fumes from the hot transmission were so bad we just 
hoped they wouldn't bother Lori," Drews said. "The worst time we had was after 
the race when he had to thread our way through all the boats to get to the dock 
with no steering." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven-time winner Chuck Stearns, 52, won the 45-and-over class, but could 
manage only 26th overall. He was timed in 1:16.23, which was still faster than 
his first four winning races.

<P>
CONNER GETS SPONSORS, PREPARES TO BUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quietly, while the competition wondered what he was up to, Dennis Conner was 
building up steam to defend the America's Cup off San Diego in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is the first American to start building a boat for the defense. Next 
week, it will be announced that, with the re-enlistment of a former sponsor to 
join Cadillac -- and its $3 million, he is the first American to bank $6 
million, which will be required of all would-be defenders by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
A third "gold-level" sponsor, as Conner's campaign calls such a contributor, 
may already be secured, but Conner is spreading out the announcements for 
maximum effect. From now on, the others are playing catchup. 
</P>
<P>
It's somewhat early to write off the others, but Conner's operations manager, 
Bill Trenkle, said: "They're not making any progress," by which he meant that 
their funding is way short, and nobody else is building a boat. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same old problem: Many people think Dennis Conner is the America's 
Cup, and even when told he must compete to defend it, they aren't inclined to 
back any longshots. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Conner said with a shrug, "that's a personal problem." 
</P>
<P>
Trenkle questioned whether Conner's three rivals -- Peter Isler, Larry Klein 
and John Bertrand's Beach Boys syndicate -- will get to the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
"The only possibility I see is Bill Koch coming in," Trenkle said. 
</P>
<P>
Koch is the energy tycoon, based in Dedham, Mass., who built the old and new 
Matador maxi-boats and recently expressed interest in sailing for the America's 
Cup, as either a partner or a new contender. He has talked to Conner and other 
potential American defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) he has enough money that he could run his own program," Conner said. "He 
doesn't need me. He had $800 million through two weeks ago, and now with oil up 
30% . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Conner said he would like to have some competition before the finals -- but 
only on the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, and Koch would be a good one to have. He's a class guy and he'd do a 
quality job -- plus he won't tap into corporate America." 
</P>
<P>
Conner would hope to have that to himself. He isn't looking for help from 
syndicates that falter, the way he recruited Isler as his navigator before the 
1987 Cup races off Fremantle, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have whatever's good, but what do they really have?" he said. "I 
have the best sailmaker, the best builder and plenty of talent sailingwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really need Peter to navigate. I know where the marks are off Pt. 
Loma." 
</P>
<P>
The sailmaker is Tom Whidden, president of North Sails and also Conner's 
tactician. The boat is being built at Eric Goetz's yard in Bristol, R.I., from 
a design by David Pedrick, recently joined by highly regarded naval architect 
Alberto Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the old Stars &amp; Stripes team have drifted to other syndicates -- 
chiefly that of Isler. 
</P>
<P>
But Conner said: "They don't have any of my team. My team is all giants. They 
didn't take any of my guys." 
</P>
<P>
Conner spent an afternoon charming corporate and yachting VIPs at Marina del 
Rey last week. The occasion was delivery of one of his practice 40-foot Stars 
&amp; Stripes catamarans to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which is nearing 
completion. A Dixieland trio played, and a former Miss USA "christened" the 
catamaran's temporary dock by smashing a champagne bottle against a concrete 
piling. 
</P>
<P>
Several invitees took a short sail with Conner -- a bargain at no charge this 
time. The hotel will charter the catamaran to guests. If they want a cruise 
with Conner, that's another $10,000, the going rate he has established in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to try to make a living," he has said. "I've got two girls going to 
college." 
</P>
<P>
All of this has taken its toll on Conner. 
</P>
<P>
"I gained about 12 pounds in 10 weeks out on the road," he said, explaining the 
comeback of his paunch. 
</P>
<P>
Then he was off to New York to charm some more. It's part of the program. 
Conner drew the modern blueprint for sailing the America's Cup. "I've set a 
tough standard," he said. "I feel like a guy going through the snow. They're 
all following in my footsteps, and I've got to keep moving to stay ahead of 
them. But they don't know which way I'm going." 
</P>
<P>
Americans won two sailing gold medals in the recent Goodwill Games at Seattle 
and would have won three were it not for the sportsmanship of Scott Steele, 32, 
of Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Steele, a 1984 Olympic silver medalist in sailboards, was running second in the 
series after Poland's front-running Grzegorz Myszkowski was disqualified in the 
fourth race for failing to return after a premature start. 
</P>
<P>
However, Steele had seen Myszkowski restart and told the jury so. Myszkowski 
was reinstated, dropping Steele to third. 
</P>
<P>
Then Steele won the sixth race to move into first place overall, but got 
tangled in weeds in the seventh and final race, fell off his board and finished 
fourth, settling for a silver medal, behind Myszkowski. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Ledbetter of San Diego and Jody Swanson of Buffalo, N.Y., with crew Cory 
Fischer-Sertl of Rochester, N.Y., won golds in Finn and women's 470. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
It's questionable whether any American besides Dennis Conner will have a boat 
ready for the first America's Cup class world championships off San Diego next 
May. Peter Isler plans to start construction in October, which is cutting it 
close. The 1991 worlds will be mainly for show and won't offer many clues to 
the '92 winner, anyway. The serious contenders probably won't be sailing their 
final boats. . . . Conner passed up the 12-meter worlds off Fremantle in 1986 
to continue preparing in Hawaii. But he probably will sail next May to give his 
backers exposure. Besides, he's the hometown hero. "We have to go for corporate 
push," he said. "We'll learn something. It's worth going. But I'm not real 
excited about it because we don't expect to be that fast." 
</P>
<P>
If well-heeled Bill Koch joins the America's Cup defense picture, his skipper 
could be Buddy Melges, the veteran from Zenda, Wis. . . . Italy's first, 
benchmark boat, sailed by American Paul Cayard, lost three consecutive test 
races to France's entry. The lire-loaded Il Moro di Venezia syndicate plans to 
build four boats and is the first to announce a San Diego base: Gerry 
Driscoll's boat yard on Shelter Island. Driscoll is a former Cup competitor and 
San Diego Yacht Club member who was at odds with the club for the way it 
handled the controversial catamaran defense against New Zealand in 1988. The 
Italians plan to move in by next Jan. 5. . . . The 21 challengers from 15 
countries must post a $150,000 performance bond by Sept. 3. Look for the field 
to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy of the nation's top teen-age sailors, competing in 30 boats in three 
classes, have reached the USYRU/Rolex Junior Sailing Championships next Friday 
through Aug. 25 at Balboa, hosted by the Newport Harbor Yacht Club. Ages are 13 
through 17. The event will be preceded by an on-the-water racing clinic for 
competitors featuring a world-class roster of instructors -- Larry Klein, John 
Bertrand, Robbie Haines, John Shadden, Charlie McKee and Brian Ledbetter. Doug 
Rastello is chairman. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen ultralight 70s (sleds) will compete in the Cabrillo Beach YC's 
first Summer Sled Regatta Aug. 25-26 off San Pedro. They will sail a tight 
course around "Hurricane Gulch," within sight of the beach. The public may tour 
the boats from 9 to 10:30 a.m. on the 26th. . . . The Women's Sailing Assn. of 
Santa Monica Bay will feature Bill Herrschaft of North Sails at its Aug. 21 
meeting at the Pacific Mariners YC. For membership information, call (213) 
821-8460.

CITIES SAY NOTICES OF MEETINGS WON'T END 
</P>

Although a little-noticed provision of the state budget suspends an 
open-meeting law for city councils and other elected bodies, many local 
officeholders say they will continue to post an agenda three days before any 
meeting, stick to that agenda and allow public testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Budget-writers suspended the open-meeting law for a year as a cost-saving 
measure. A recent study indicated that it would cost the state more than $2 
million annually to reimburse local governments for the cost of complying with 
the law, although some critics contend it actually would cost much less. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard it said that it would save millions of dollars, but I don't see 
how," said Tustin Mayor Richard B. Edgar. "I mean, how much time does it take 
for an individual to take a piece of paper and put it on a bulletin board? 
Practically nothing. And what is the cost of letting people speak at a public 
meeting? Nothing that I can see." 
</P>
<P>
Public interest groups and newspaper editorialists are furious about the move, 
saying it will allow local lawmakers to conduct shady, back-room dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a disaster for open meetings at the local level," said Ruth 
Holton, a lobbyist for Common Cause. "There are unscrupulous local agencies 
that will no doubt be delighted now to hold meetings without the public's 
knowledge and without public comment." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Lida Lenney agreed: "This measure cuts at the heart of the 
democratic process." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in a number of Orange County cities said they intend to follow the 
provisions of the now-suspended law. Many said they posted agendas and allowed 
public comment before it was required and will continue to do so, even though 
it is no longer a mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the importance of community involvement in local government, the 
Huntington Beach City Council unanimously passed a resolution last week to 
continue posting agendas and listening to public comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty used to the current procedures," Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays 
said. "As long as I'm mayor, we'll continue to have public comments. It's very 
important to have community input in local government and it's important to 
have agenda postings." 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin City Council will consider such a resolution at its next meeting and 
officials in other cities have voiced their support for continuing under the 
previous requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"This City Council is not interested in holding secret meetings," said Irvine 
City Manager Paul Brady. "We have no interest in changing the public's access 
to their government." 
</P>
<P>
The open-meeting law was one of 19 state mandates -- including a requirement 
that police officers provide assistance to stranded motorists and that judges 
consider victims' statements when sentencing felons -- that were suspended this 
year to achieve a claimed savings of $59 million. 
</P>
<P>
James Apps, a budget analyst for the Department of Finance, said most of those 
requirements were "totally unnecessary" because local government would perform 
the functions even if the state didn't pick up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) introduced legislation Monday to reinstate the 
law. Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), author of the 1986 
open-meeting law, said he would follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any public entities are going to abuse the law in the next year, 
but the potential is there," Connelly said. "There is a history of public 
entities acting without public notice. In some instances it's negligence, but 
in other instances it may have been intended." 
</P>
<P>
So far no state money has been paid out because of the open-meeting requirement 
and only one local agency -- the Los Angeles City Council, which asked for 
$12,000 in 1987 -- has ever filed for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
While the Orange County Board of Supervisors has not considered the issue, the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, estimated it would cost $1.6 million 
over four years to pay for the posting of agendas and allowing public 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics challenge those numbers, however. "That's just junk. It has no 
basis in fiscal reality. It's not going to cost the state a dime to enforce 
this mandate," said Connelly, adding that it is relatively inexpensive to type 
and post a two- or three-page agenda.

SKIN CANCER SCREENING RESULTS DRAMATIZE SUN HAZARD, UCI DOCTORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people in Orange County are apparently not listening: Too much sun is not 
good for you. Sun worshipers who frolic on the county's beaches without 
protection from the glare of cloudless skies may very likely get skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at UC Irvine's Melanoma Center say they know they sound like a broken 
record, but they figure many outdoors types in this county are still not paying 
attention. And now they have more evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
During a skin cancer screening offered by the center during April and May, 1 of 
every 5 persons was diagnosed with skin cancer, while almost a third had 
precancerous lesions -- numbers that alarmed some doctors and others at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really amazed at what we saw," said Leslie Ann Cyril, a spokesperson 
for the center. "Melanomas are being discovered in much younger people. That's 
what's so surprising." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Matthew Goodman, co-director of the melanoma center, cautioned that these 
results are not an accurate measure of skin cancer prevalence among the general 
population, nor was this meant as a scientific study. The 175 people who were 
screened, he said, probably likely suspected they might have a problem with 
skin abnormalities, including skin cancer. However, he said, results of this 
screening echo trends in national studies showing that skin cancer is on the 
rise, especially among people who live in sunny Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It reiterates the need to use good judgment in our sun habits and the use of a 
sun screen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of 15 or greater," he said. "It 
shows that it could happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
He also said it is an indication that there is still a great need for better 
educational programs warning about the dangers of the sun in this county of 
sunny beaches and endless summers. The melanoma center, which opened in 1986 at 
the UCI Clinical Cancer Center and is the only such center in Orange County, 
has started some educational programs for elementary school children, Cyril 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society estimates that 60,000 people will develop skin 
cancer during 1990, a 4% increase from last year. Of those, 27,600 will be 
diagnosed with melanoma, the most serious form, and the Cancer Society 
estimates that 6,300 people will die from melanoma this year. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Matthews said he could not overstate the need for caution and 
prevention. The cancer center plans to offer another screening in the fall, he 
said, and he encouraged people in Orange County, especially those who engage in 
outdoor activity, to get themselves checked out. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion it is related to the popularity of the masses going to the beach 
and other outdoor recreation as much as they have in the last few years, almost 
to a fanatic extreme," he said. "Well, don't say fanatic extreme, because I 
think outdoor recreation is great and good. But people should be prudent." 
</P>
<P>
But Dore Gilbert, a Newport Beach dermatologist, said he thinks people living 
along the coast are well-informed about the dangers of overexposure. The higher 
incidence of skin cancer and melanoma cases, he said, could reflect an 
increased awareness among people who are seeking medical help earlier, before 
it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
"In this area, in Orange County and also in Los Angeles, people are very aware 
of melanoma," he said. "If you get out to more rural areas, areas away from the 
coast, you are going to find more people who say, 'It can't happen to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those, he said, are the people to worry about.

STREET SMART: LANE-SPLITTING MANNERS A MATTER OF MUTUAL RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: Why do freeway drivers seem to carry a grudge against 
motorcyclists? Not all do, of course, but the few who do are downright 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
I am middle-aged and ride one of those big, full-dress touring bikes. Suffice 
to say I enjoy it. Like many motorcyclists, I split lanes in backed-up 
bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
</P>
<P>
It's not always easy. I have had car drivers pull over in front of me to cut me 
off and block me from passing. If I don't see them in time, they could easily 
knock me down and into the path of an oncoming car or truck. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, many commuters are troubled by such lane splitting, but all of us 
motorcycle riders are really doing them a favor. If you took every motorcycle 
on every freeway and put them into a lane of traffic, I'll guarantee it would 
move every car a half-mile farther back than they are now. 
</P>
<P>
It seems the mentality of most people is, "If I have to wait, everybody has to 
wait." But we are not costing anybody any time. In fact, we are actually saving 
everybody time spent on the freeway. Give us a break. Leave a little room. 
</P>
<P>
Robert G. Xiques 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
An interesting point. I'm not sure just how much time the average commuter 
saves because lane-splitting motorcyclists aren't taking up space in the 
regular traffic lanes, but it must be a bit. There are, after all, more than 4 
million registered motorcycles in the United States, 643,000 in California 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
For the uninformed, lane splitting is legal in stalled traffic as long as the 
motorcyclist is moving at a safe speed. Unfortunately, some cyclists rip at a 
breakneck pace along the narrow corridor formed between the lanes of idling 
cars, putting themselves in a precarious position if some driver suddenly 
swings into another lane. 
</P>
<P>
While car drivers should be careful to watch out for motorcycles splitting 
lanes during the daily peak traffic crunch, cyclists should also take 
precautions by keeping their speed down in such situations. California Highway 
Patrol officers typically recommend a motorcyclist go no faster than 10 m.p.h. 
than the flow of traffic when splitting lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look to do much cruising along 4th Street between Santa Ana and Tustin in 
the months to come. At 1 a.m. sharp this coming Friday, the state Department of 
Transportation will shut down the 4th Street bridges over both the Santa Ana 
and Costa Mesa freeways and begin making preparations to demolish the 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
It's all being done as part of the ambitious effort to widen the traffic-choked 
Santa Ana Freeway. To expand the freeway from its current clogged six lanes to 
a commuter-friendly 12 lanes, the agency has to widen each of the bridges along 
the route, and the 4th Street crossings are first on the list. So down they'll 
come to make way for a pair of new structures, which Caltrans officials hope to 
complete in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge work is really just an initial step in what promises to be a 
decade-long construction project. When completed, the freeway will consist of 
12 lanes from its intersection with the San Diego Freeway on the south to the 
Orange and Garden Grove freeways on the north. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Freeway was built in the mid-1950s as a rural four-lane freeway 
and expanded to six lanes in 1965. Unchecked population growth since then has 
dropped the average peak-hour speed on the freeway from 50 m.p.h. to less than 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Money to expand the freeway has always been scarce, but passage of Proposition 
111, the state gas-tax hike, has solved that problem. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the hard part: the dust and noise and bother of construction. While 
we all put up with that for the next 10 years, motorists can get a peek at what 
the project will look like when it's completed. Caltrans has an impressive, 
16-by-20-foot model of the entire network that will be on display at the Irvine 
Transportation Center beginning today. The display moves in November to the 
Tustin Senior Center, Caltrans said.

BIG PLANS SIMMER FOR HOT SPRINGS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE OPERATOR OF THE POPULAR BACKCOUNTRY RESORT IN SOUTH COUNTY 
ENVISIONS A MAJOR EXPANSION BUT FACES HURDLES.

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For generations, visitors have journeyed to San Juan Hot Springs to luxuriate 
in the 120-degree natural baths on a cool summer night. 
</P>
<P>
From the late 1800s until the 1930s, the springs flourished as a resort, 
providing boardinghouse accommodations for $3 a week and hot baths for 35 
cents. A dance hall adorned the site, and visitors came from far and near in 
response to ads that touted the hot springs as a "fountain of youth." 
</P>
<P>
But the high cost of meeting health requirements drove the resort out of 
business in 1936, and the springs fell into disuse until the 1960s and '70s, 
when it was rediscovered by hippies. Finally, the 1980s saw the return of a 
resort to San Juan Hot Springs, and with it, a steady stream of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are a little steeper today -- it costs $9.50 for a hot tub visit and 
camping is $6.25 per night -- but the hot springs is a popular summer 
destination, drawing between 3,000 and 4,000 visitors per month, operators say. 
A major part of the attraction, they say, is that people like the idea of 
sitting in a steaming tub on cool summer nights. 
</P>
<P>
"People come here and I see a transformation happen," Sally Stone, acting 
manager of San Juan Hot Springs, said last week as visitors camped and relaxed 
under sycamores and oaks. "I see a hyper city person become calm here. 
</P>
<P>
Today, San Juan Hot Springs is a budding commercial enterprise that the current 
operator hopes to eventually transform into a major resort, complete with 
hotel, conference center and on-site masseuses. 
</P>
<P>
Since the hot springs are situated in the middle of the Santa Ana Mountains, 
about 13 miles east of San Juan Capistrano off the Ortega Highway, the proposal 
has stirred some concern among those who want the land preserved in its 
pristine state. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always sad to lose open spaces," said Michael Phillips, executive 
director for Laguna Greenbelt and Laguna Canyon Conservancy, two of Orange 
County's more active environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
But Russ Kiessig, a Dana Point entrepreneur who operates the springs, said 
development is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"There are those who would like to see it left pristine and total wilderness, 
but the natural demand of humanity is to use those springs," Kiessig said. "And 
it's sort of my charter to make it as comfortable and safe as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Kiessig, who along with his wife, Carol, re-opened San Juan Hot Springs in 1982 
under a 30-year lease from Orange County, wants to pattern the site after a hot 
springs resort he built on the coast near San Luis Obispo. That resort features 
spas on the balcony of each hotel room and access to golf and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
At San Juan Hot Springs, the Kiessigs want to build 100 to 150 cottage-style 
rooms. He also wants to double the existing number of outdoor tubs from about 
25 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
Kiessig, however, must surmount a couple of obstacles before he can see his 
plans come to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
The first problem is money. Kiessig said he did not have adequate financial 
backing to build a full resort when he first opened and that he is still 
looking for a partner who will help bankroll the venture. 
</P>
<P>
The other problem is getting county permission. 
</P>
<P>
The Kiessigs were given the option to build a hotel and conference center on 30 
acres of county property adjoining a 17-acre tract that he first acquired. The 
land is all situated within the county-run Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
But that option lapsed in October, 1982, when they failed to expand, said Ted 
Miller, the county's chief of lease management. Now, Miller said, the Kiessigs 
will have to resubmit their plans and have them reviewed by the County Board of 
Supervisors for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The county has a vested interest in the Kiessigs' operation. Under terms of the 
lease, the county allowed the couple to charge for use of the springs in return 
for paying the county $5,000 a year and a cut of all proceeds. The cut is 20% 
of admission fees and 5% of rental of hot tubs and the picnic and camping 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
With the county currently experiencing a financial crunch, Miller said county 
officials will likely favor an expansion if the Kiessigs could demonstrate 
financial feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We're open to anything that makes money," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Although their most grandiose plans are still on hold, the Kiessigs have 
managed to transform the hot springs into a semblance of the tourist attraction 
it was in its turn-of-the century heyday. 
</P>
<P>
They have installed 25 redwood and cement tubs, with names like Paradise and 
Nirvana, under secluded stands of tree and brush. They have also put in 16 
camping sites, and rebuilt a 100-foot-by 30-foot swimming pool that was covered 
over in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion has continued this summer with the first of the rental cottages, 
and the addition of two Indian-style tepees for rent. The facility already had 
one tepee. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled in the mountains abutting Cleveland National Forest, the hot springs 
were first documented by Spanish missionaries who visited Mission San Juan 
Capistrano in the late 1700s. Local Indians who had known of the site for 
centuries believed the bubbling water spewing forth from the earth had 
spiritual healing power. 
</P>
<P>
The hot springs were developed as a resort after a railroad line was extended 
south to San Juan Capistrano in 1888, according to local historical accounts. 
The proprietors billed the springs as a "fountain of youth." Soon, a dance hall 
and boardinghouse went up as visitors flooded in from throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
The resort flourished until 1936, when it closed because the owner was unable 
to comply with new health requirements. The owner, enraged, dynamited the 
swimming pool, and many of the buildings were dismantled. The dance hall, 
however, was moved to San Juan Capistrano and is in use today as that city's 
senior citizen center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the springs were fenced off from the public for decades, the hippies 
of the '60s and '70s climbed over and set up camp, sometimes in groups of as 
large as 300. County park rangers and sheriff's deputies made numerous arrests 
for trespassing, but the hippies kept returning, according to news accounts at 
the time. Finally, the county bulldozed the concrete bathing tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Though a few surreptitious nighttime visits were reported in the intervening 
years, the hot springs did not re-emerge as a visitors' mecca until 1982 when 
they were reopened under the Kiessigs' supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Though open year-round, Stone said the biggest upsurge in visitors comes during 
the summer when camping, picnic, hot tub and cold-water swimming facilities are 
all open. On Friday and Saturday nights, she said, the hot tubs are booked up 
solid, usually reserved in advance. The camping and swimming are also popular, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We drove by once and said, 'Gee, let's stop by sometime,' " Tommy Soto, 32, of 
San Bernardino, said as he lounged last week in the swimming pool with his two 
sons. "I came by last night and I'll probably come again. It's nice and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Regina Manz and her boyfriend, Roman Brenner, tourists from West Germany, 
happened onto the hot springs while looking for a place to camp several days 
ago. They were going to spend only one night, but wound up spending seven. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it. It's beautiful," said Manz as they, too, relaxed at the pool last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Manz, 25, said that she and Brenner, 26, an investment broker, had wanted to 
find a place near the beach to camp but were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"We always got the wrong directions and then we found they were all full," Manz 
said. "We got a little angry, and so we went to Lake Elsinore. Then I saw on 
the road atlas this place was here. And there were no tourists!"

DISTRICTS GRAPPLE WITH CUTS IN BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERYLANNE BEALER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators in the Capistrano and Saddleback Valley unified school districts 
say they may be forced to cut programs and deny salary increases in order to 
absorb their share of $462 million cut by Gov. George Deukmejian from the state 
education budget last month. 
</P>
<P>
In the Saddleback Valley district, officials estimate that the state cuts 
amount to $1.3 million in lost revenue. To make matters worse, this year's 
$96.4-million budget already suffers from a $1.7-million decrease in revenue 
and a $2.6-million increase in expenditures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to be in a hole to start with," said Bob Cornelius, assistant 
superintendent for fiscal services. "We were in bad shape last year, and what 
the governor's done this year is going to make things worse." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Unified School District officials are breathing a bit easier, having 
figured a 3% cost-of-living adjustment into their coming budget, the same 
percentage used in the state budget allocations. Other districts had counted on 
a 4% increase, as was originally provided in the state budget, and so are now 
having to absorb the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The district also has about $5 million in a contingency fund intended to be 
used in case of emergencies, said Bill Eller, assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
But administrators in both districts said that cutting programs to balance the 
budget will become a definite possibility as costs rise and funds from the 
state are withheld. 
</P>
<P>
"You either go get more money or you squeeze what you got," Cornelius said. 
</P>
<P>
Some programs, such as those for California Assessment Program tests and driver 
training, have already been eliminated because they were not protected by 
Proposition 98, which guarantees that 40% of the state budget is allocated to 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are also bracing for the effects of the cuts. Negotiations in 
Saddleback Valley for the 1990-91 contract were suspended in May as both sides 
waited for the state budget to be finalized. Talks will resume in late 
September, said Assistant Supt. Ken Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
In Capistrano Unified, state budget cuts also are likely to result in another 
difficult year of negotiations with the teachers union. The only way to fund a 
salary increase would be to cut programs or dip into the contingency fund, 
Eller said. 
</P>
<P>
"People just have to recognize that some $400 million has been taken from the 
districts' budgets," he said. "If programs or services need to be cut, we're 
just reacting to what is provided for us by the state." CHERYLANNE BEALER

<P>
Tipped off by a caller reporting a rape in progress, police arrested a 
26-year-old man Sunday in connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Medina of La Habra was being held in Orange County Jail late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old female victim, whose name was not released, was walking alone 
near the intersection of Lambert Road and Walnut Street at about 4 a.m. when 
she was allegedly accosted by Medina, said La Habra Police Sgt. Ron Harryman. 
</P>
<P>
Harryman said the rape was in progress when police arrived and that the victim 
did not know her attacker. The woman suffered bruises to her face and was 
treated and released at St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, Harryman 
said. WENDY PAULSON

<P>
BALBOA ISLAND PARK PLAN TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members today will consider a proposal to turn the site of a 
former gas station at Marine and Park avenues into a mini-park for residents of 
Balboa Island, Little Island and Collins Island. 
</P>
<P>
The Unocal station has already been demolished, and the city has budgeted money 
to buy the site and build a fire station on the major portion of the land, 
which sits at the southeastern corner of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The fire station plans have been put on hold, however, because area homeowner 
associations have expressed interest in building and maintaining a small park 
at the location. Their urgings prompted City Manager Robert L. Wynn to devise a 
proposal calling for the city to finance the demolition and then build a 
mini-park. 
</P>
<P>
Council members will not take any action on the issue.

CITY COUNCIL TO AID ANTI-DRUG EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members voted last week to spend $500 on Red Ribbon Week, an 
October event that officials said will help demonstrate the city's commitment 
to fighting drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, local organizations and schools have conducted their own programs. 
This year, however, Mayor Eva G. Miner suggested a coordinated approach to the 
community activities, and the council agreed. The week of Oct. 21-28 has been 
set aside for the event. 
</P>
<P>
City officials will encourage local schools and community organizations to 
participate in the activities and will try to inform residents of the schedule 
of events. The city's contribution will go toward distributing buttons, ribbons 
and balloons, officials said.

A WIFE WONDERS IF HER MARINE WILL COME BACK

EL TORO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 29, May Castaneda says she is too young to remember the Vietnam War and 
finds the possibility of her husband engaged in combat almost surreal. 
</P>
<P>
It was midweek when Miguel Castaneda, a Marine Corps sergeant at El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, told his wife that he was headed for the Persian Gulf. But 
the news didn't really register until Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard some of the helicopters flying overhead and my heart went to my 
mouth," May Castaneda said, recalling the moment that she comprehended the full 
meaning of his words. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do something to control this loony-tune over there then the whole 
world suffers," said Castaneda, who served three years in the Army in the early 
1980s. "It's easy for me to understand that, but as a wife it's hard to say my 
husband is going to go over there and he may come home OK and he may not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's even harder to explain it to my children." 
</P>
<P>
Making the separation especially painful, May Castaneda said, is the fact her 
husband only returned home to his wife and three young children last month 
after a six-month deployment in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
And making it especially frightening, she said, is the potential for a 
sustained commitment of troops in the Middle East. The fear that this latest 
military crisis might become the most serious since the Vietnam War was echoed 
by many of the residents of this close-knit neighborhood of military housing, 
just behind the El Toro base. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda's husband was only days away from completing a tour in the Army when 
the United States invaded Grenada in 1983, she said. She recalled the fear of 
waiting, as a new mother with a 3-week old baby, to learn whether her husband 
would be called into battle. 
</P>
<P>
Even that vigil, however, was not as frightening as today's uncertainity, she 
said, because there was not the same sense of a potentially long-term 
engagement. 
</P>
<P>
This past weekend, the rumble of the helicopters flying out of the Marine Corps 
base in Tustin was only one of many signs of imminent deployment that have 
haunted the neighborhood. The local mini-market, for example, was busy until 
closing this Saturday with Marines in search of last-minute supplies, May 
Castaneda said. Among the hottest selling items was non-aerosol insect 
repellent. Canned bug spray, she explained, would be likely to explode in the 
torturous desert heat of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
May Castaneda sees one particularly frightening sign of the increasing 
tensions: A military police officer now boards each civilian bus as it enters 
the base and remains on the bus until it leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Still, only her oldest daughter, 6-year-old Victoria, has any inkling of the 
crisis, Castaneda said. Victoria noticed Saturday night when her father packed 
a knife in a bag with his military gear. Then her father picked her up and put 
her on the kitchen counter to explain, as best he could, that everything would 
probably be all right, Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
"She started crying and he swallowed hard," Castaneda said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
NOT SO FAST, HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach has been hearing it from all sides -- from local 
environmentalists, the State Lands Commission and from a corps of its own wary 
public officials -- that allowing development planned for the ocean side of 
Pacific Coast Highway would be a violation of a public trust. 
</P>
<P>
Its own history echoes an earlier day when the city fought to get a 
public-access easement over beach land. Now that the Planning Commission is 
about to take up the controversial Pierside Village project later this month, 
it should heed the warnings and spare the oceanfront land from development. 
</P>
<P>
The land that would be leased by a developer to build a plaza of fountains, 
walkways and restaurants is now a semi-developed, paved parking lot near the 
municipal pier. It has been a lively focus of debate in a city trying to polish 
its facade to become a tourist mecca. Also, environmentalists and some city 
officials have wrangled over the sale or leasing of beach land and parkland. 
The notion of untampered public access is nothing new, since the city battled 
in the 1930s to get public-access easement over the beach land over the 
objections of powerful development, oil and rail interests. But in recent 
years, despite the environmental concerns of some city officials, the city 
seemingly has forsaken its legacy as beachfront protector to act at times as if 
it were a party to development itself. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of easements and access will engage the State Lands Commission, which 
has issued dire warnings to the city about the threat of further litigation. A 
settlement last spring resolved little. 
</P>
<P>
As the population grows, the door could be opened to further conversions of 
precious beachfront land into sites for hotels, motels, apartments and 
commercial buildings. The Coastal Commission, which earlier approved a general 
plan for the downtown, surely will have reservations about such dangerous 
development. The issue has been joined, but the choice is clear: City planners 
should decide in favor of public easement and public access.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
LET'S GET PHYSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Improved learning is one of the obvious benefits of making sure that elementary 
school students are healthy. However, Orange County public schools have a 
disturbingly low rate of compliance with a state requirement that children 
entering first grade have physical exams. 
</P>
<P>
That's a shame, and school districts need to make more of an impression on 
parents about the value of such screening. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Health Care Agency estimates that nearly a third of 
first-graders are not checked out medically before they start classes. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the problem is traceable to a loophole in state law, which enables 
parents to waive the exam for religious or cultural reasons, even though the 
point of the exams since first conducted in 1975 has been to identify 
developmental problems or disabilities that could affect a child's ability to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
The waiver is easily claimed by anyone, even though officials estimate that 
less than 5% of Orange County's population actually has legitimate 
prohibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this can be traced to misunderstanding. Parents need to know that they 
don't have to go out and get another physical if a child has had a physical 
within 18 months of enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Proposition 99 has changed the ground rules, offering money to Orange 
County to expand physicals to all low- and moderate-income children through age 
18. 
</P>
<P>
So there's no excuse. At registration time, school districts should make an 
extra effort to educate parents.

3 SANTA ANA INCUMBENTS WILL FACE 6 CHALLENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six candidates, including a school board member and the president of a 
countywide Mexican-American women's organization, will challenge three Santa 
Ana City Council members and the mayor in the upcoming November city election. 
</P>
<P>
As the filing period closed Friday, incumbent councilman Ron May appeared to 
face his toughest challenge from Robert L. Richardson, a school board member 
and executive assistant to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. Santa Ana city employee 
Robert Banuelos, who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1986 and 1988, 
is also in the race. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Richardson announced his candidacy by accusing Santa Ana planning 
commissioner Don Sizemore, May's campaign manager, of illegally soliciting 
funds for the councilman. The next day, Sizemore responded with a charge that 
Richardson had failed to file certain campaign statement forms. 
</P>
<P>
May, a Santa Ana High School teacher, represents a district that includes some 
of the poorest sections of Santa Ana; one that has been plagued by overcrowding 
and crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson contends that May has not been a leader on the council in pushing 
for solutions to those problems. "He's a passive participant on the council 
instead of an active member," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
May asserts that Richardson is a "bureaucrat" who "thinks in terms of process. 
He's very methodical. But in terms of creativity, spontaneity and vision, 
there's no comparison between Rob Richardson and Ron May." 
</P>
<P>
May and Richardson say the city should enact stricter limits on neighborhood 
overcrowding, while Banuelos says he wants to study the problem further before 
taking a position. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richards L. Norton has drawn two challengers: Irene Martinez, who 
hopes to be the first Latina on the council, and attorney Glenn Mondo, who is a 
member of the mayor's task force on transportation. Both challengers have never 
run for public office. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, the president of the Mexican-American Women's National Assn. of 
Orange County, is a program coordinator for a social service organization in 
Santa Ana. She acknowledges that she moved from La Mirada to Santa Ana a month 
ago specifically to run against Norton. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to see they can identify themselves with someone on the council," 
Martinez said. "I'm not a politician. I'm not someone striving for power. I 
work here and now live here and I see what needs to be taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Mondo says Norton is too combative to be an effective representative. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick's a loner," Mondo said. "He's up there making his own proposals without 
background material or coalitions. It takes more than throwing out proposals to 
do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Norton said such a criticism "doesn't bother me. The old guard resists change 
and creative ideas. I'm not part of the old guard." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr., meanwhile, faces opposition from Coween A. 
Dickerson, a member of the city's cable television advisory board and a 
self-employed business systems analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson says that the city needs more police officers in its 351-member 
department and fewer high-density buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Pulido has been under fire from the Latino rights group 
Hermandad Mexicana Nacional. The group's director, Nativo V. Lopez, promised to 
picket the councilman's family business weekly until the election because of a 
disagreement over the distribution of city-controlled federal funds. Pulido 
says the picketing now occurs only once a month. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido says his reelection campaign will focus on neighborhood issues as well 
as citywide problems such as gangs and graffiti. Over the past four years, he 
has been instrumental in lobbying against placement of a new centralized jail 
in Santa Ana and pushing for an anti-gang program in city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to bring access to City Hall," Pulido said. "When I was running 
for office four years ago, it was difficult to even talk to the council. Now, 
you can sit down and meet with council members." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young, a developer who has served on the council since 1982, 
faces virtually unknown challenger Richard G. Moser, an automotive engineer, 
who says he plans to run a low-budget campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Moser believes he can moderate the council better than Young. Moser also 
dislikes the proposal for building a sports arena in Santa Ana and thinks the 
city can better spend tax dollars elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I like him (Young) personally," Moser said. "But he's been in there a long 
time and he's become part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Young says he will concentrate on improving neighborhoods in the city and push 
for a monorail system in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining council members -- Daniel E. Griset, Patricia A. McGuigan and 
John Acosta -- are not up for election this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, Matt Archbold's lifestyle was as radical and unpredictable 
as the waves he surfed each day. 
</P>
<P>
Speeding through life's fast lane, Archbold landed in a San Clemente jail last 
spring and later in a rehabilitation clinic to fight a drug and alcohol habit. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21, Archbold's surfing career appeared to be over. 
</P>
<P>
But less than five months later, his recovery has come full circle. He edged 
friend and fellow San Clemente surfer Dino Andino to win the Laguna Sportswear 
pro-am competition Sunday at Salt Creek Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Archbold earned $7,400 for the victory; Andino earned $3,400 and took over 
first place in the point standings with his finish. Ted Robinson of Manhattan 
Beach, who was third, won $2,500 and fourth-place finisher Vince De La Pena 
earned $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like everything is going right for me," Archbold said. "I want to 
keep it up and not let myself down." 
</P>
<P>
Archbold knows all about letdowns. He just wasn't ready to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
But in April, when Archbold was arrested for driving under the influence, he 
realized his life was being wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
While sitting in an eight-foot by 10-foot cell, Archbold did a lot of thinking. 
He thought about his family, the friends he lost and the surfing contests he 
couldn't compete in because he was hungover. He thought about his dependency on 
alcohol and cocaine, and how it cost him his major sponsorship on the pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a long look at myself and decided I didn't like myself," Archbold said. 
</P>
<P>
So Archbold checked into the Betty Ford Clinic. He learned to deal with his 
problems, and his dependency. 
</P>
<P>
He checked out of the clinic early in the summer and rejoined the Professional 
Surfing Assn. of America tour. He finished seventh in his first event back, at 
Oceanside in June. Then he reached the finals at San Clemente in July, where he 
placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the victory at Salt Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thankful that I pulled through everything," Archbold said. "My family and 
my girlfriend have been behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Archbold appears to have his problems behind him. At least that's what Andino 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stoked for him," Andino said. "He's different now in every way, mentally, 
physically. He was more to himself before. We drifted apart as friends. But now 
he's much more open with everyone." 
</P>
<P>
And especially with himself. 
</P>
<P>
Although he finished second for the second consecutive event, Andino didn't go 
home disappointed. Andino passed Charlie Kuhn of Indian Harbor, Fla., for the 
lead in the point standings and has a 297-point lead over Kuhn, who was 
eliminated in the quarterfinals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The points title has eluded Andino the last two seasons, with him placing 
second to Mike Lambresi of Oceanside both times. With only four events on the 
11-stop tour remaining this year, Andino hopes he has the championship in his 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to be in the lead," Andino said, "but it ain't by much. I've got 
my focus back and my head's on right (after a slow start this season)." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stewart, a native of Anaheim now living in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, won his 
third title this season in the bodyboarding division, holding off Harry 
Antipala of Kalaheo, Hawaii, in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a three-time U.S. champion, extended his lead over Hawaii's Ben 
Severson to 598 points in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
"The race is still close," Stewart said. "The last contest at San Clemente, I 
thought I did well but I got beat by Ben." 
</P>
<P>
After struggling with small one- and two-foot waves all through the event, the 
competitors enjoyed three- and five-foot waves for Sunday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I had talked to (surf forecaster) Sean Collins on Saturday and he told me 
there was a swell coming up," Stewart said. "It helped to know what was going 
to happen in advance. I always want to catch the best waves I can, so I knew I 
could wait for the better ones today." 
</P>
<P>
Surfing notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides earning $7,400 in prize money, Matt Archbold won an additional $200 for 
riding the top wave of the finals. . . . By finishing second in her 
bodyboarding quarterfinal heat, Stephanie Pettersen of Haleiwa, Hawaii, became 
the first woman to advance to the semifinals of an event on the Professional 
Surfing Assn. of America tour. Pettersen finished third in her semifinal and 
failed to reach the finals. . . . The next stop on the PSAA tour starts 
Wednesday in Malibu.

SOFTER MARKET REQUIRES INNOVATIVE HOMES, ADVISER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The new home business in Orange County today is in what industry insiders 
euphemistically call a retraction. 
</P>
<P>
 That means homes aren't selling like they used to. 
</P>
<P>
 There are all kinds of reasons, from price to mortgage rates to consumers' 
fear of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 But the upshot, for most builders, is that they no longer can simply announce 
the opening of a sales office and then stand back to avoid the stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where Claudia D. Roxburgh -- pronounced Roxboro -- comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxburgh, owner of the Roxburgh Agency in Costa Mesa, is a new home marketing 
consultant whose client list includes some of the county's biggest and best 
builders. In its 10th year, the agency has collected dozens of marketing 
program awards from local, regional and national building and advertising 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Before starting her own agency, she worked as marketing director for an Orange 
County builder. It was a stint, she says, that gave her the insights and 
credentials to be able to tell builders what they are doing right and, more 
importantly, what they are doing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the big things they are doing wrong, she said, "is that, if you look at 
everything that's been built in the last three years, you don't see a lot of 
innovation. Everybody was pretty much building the same product. It was selling 
well, so why should they do anything differently?" 
</P>
<P>
 But with the current slowdown, builders are re-thinking projects they have on 
the drawing boards, and that, she says, could lead to a new spurt of 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times staff writer John O'Dell, Roxburgh discussed 
the changes she foresees as builders begin to cope with the new realities of 
Orange County's tighter housing market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. An observation on the Orange County housing market: There's not a whole lot 
of innovation and not a lot of differentiation. How do you market a product 
that looks like everybody else's? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, what's on the drawing boards now is not what you've been seeing. I 
think everybody decided we can't look at one more pink house. I'm not making a 
judgment call about whether the homes have been good or bad, but they were all 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
Q. They also get intimidating when you put 3,000-square-foot homes on 
4,000-square-foot lots and jam them in that tight. 
</P>
<P>
A. But in 10 or 15 years, when the five-gallon tree has grown above the roof 
line, it will look a whole lot better. Still, the '90s is a new decade and if 
the '80s was all about the me generation and conspicuous consumerism, then the 
'90s, in housing, is going to be marked by a return to some traditional things. 
We're seeing wood siding again on houses, and masonry, different pitches in the 
roofs, a much more traditional type of design with the elevations in a single 
development not being so much the same and having more individual character. 
But the sameness we've had really gets back to being a land-planning issue. 
When you've got a 4,000-square-foot lot, and you have to have a two-car garage, 
there is not a whole lot left you can do with the front of the house. In Orange 
County, where we don't have that much space in most new communities, there's 
only so much you can do with exteriors. But you're going to see some real 
changes inside houses. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is that? Do tastes in interior layout change all that much? 
</P>
<P>
A. Builders have to focus on interiors because homes are getting smaller. The 
look for the last 10 years basically has been to have sort of one big room. You 
walk in the front door and you can see all over the ground level. The problem 
is that when people live in those houses, there's no place to get away. And 
now, as people are spending more time at home with their entertainment centers 
and big-screen TVs and computers, there needs to be a place where somebody can 
escape and read a book. And so we're seeing changes in how a home is actually 
designed inside. That's not to say we want little boxy rooms with all kinds of 
walls that don't need to be there. But we are seeing better use of space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. As a marketing consultant, do you have any input on actual product design? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. A lot of our clients will give us a set of plans to go through. That's 
fun for us because there are lot of people here who have been on the marketing 
side with the builder and have backgrounds in that area. A typical advertising 
account executive in the real estate industry doesn't necessarily know how to 
design houses. But we get very involved with a number of our clients, 
particularly the smaller clients that don't have quite the level and depth of 
staff that a large company will. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Basically, you're bringing some marketing skills to the design. You're the 
'Gee-this-is-interesting-but- people-don't-want-bare-cellars-anymore' people? 
</P>
<P>
A. Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So you suggest the cellar be turned into a furnished entertainment room? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is part of the sales slump a reaction to that lack of innovation? People 
getting tired of the same old product? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think there's certainly a degree of that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So what changes will the industry be amazing us with over the next few 
years? 
</P>
<P>
A. What we've basically started to see are exterior changes. Different sidings 
and window treatments, more definition in roof lines, which actually is really 
important in the big condo buildings. It helps make the building look 
interesting. Inside, however, as spaces have been getting smaller again, there 
has not been a great deal of new product in terms of what you can put in 
houses. And I think that's going to be changing. Take the appliance package. It 
hasn't changed much in the last 30 years. That's because the new items are very 
unique and you can only put them in very expensive houses. But now you're 
seeing companies come out with much more cost-conscious versions. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So they'll be at Sears next year. 
</P>
<P>
A. Exactly. A lot of those kinds of companies, like plumbing fixtures and 
appliance makers, tend to be a bit remiss in reacting to what's new in the 
marketplace from an architectural standpoint, which is why some things have 
spent 10 years as a luxury product before becoming standard. But that is 
changing now. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A lot of people in Orange County are house-poor. They have nice homes, but 
they can't afford to make house payments and go out on Friday evenings, or take 
vacation. Is there a lot going on with amenities now? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we've seen more being done with back yard or indoor amenities such as 
small swimming pools and spas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How about other entertainment items? Are we coming to the day when homes 
will be sold not only with spaces for TVs and stereos, but also with TVS, VCRs, 
stereos and computers already built in? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are a number of companies that are going very strongly after the new 
home market. If a (manufacturer) can sell a builder on putting your television 
in every home, that's a lot of TVs. I know that the people who make Bose 
speakers were going very strongly after the new home market for that exact 
reason. If the builder prewires and puts Bose speakers in the family room and 
master bedroom and wherever, then you're selling a lot of speakers. I think 
you're going to see a lot more of that because people are going to have to stay 
home more because mortgages take up so much of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A lot of peer and political pressure has gone into driving up the cost of 
the house here and elsewhere. People want class and flash and high-value 
properties next door so they don't feel that their property values are being 
lowered. 
</P>
<P>
A. I understand the theory behind that. They require developers to put in front 
yard landscaping, for instance, because maybe the buyer wouldn't have the cash 
to landscape the front for a year or so and having all the yards done at once 
makes the project look better. But it does contribute to the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It is clear that the 20-year-old couple with a baby on the way is not part 
of the new home market in Orange County. So who are homes targeted at? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, a lot of single people; for example, divorced people setting up new 
households. Also couples without children. People who do have the three and 
four kids are probably, unless they have incredibly high incomes, going to have 
to live in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So you are dealing with a more sophisticated buyer, one who probably is 
buying a second or third house. How should builders market to that particular 
group? 
</P>
<P>
A. One thing to remember is that the buyer is absolutely inundated with 
information -- mail, newspapers, magazines. There is so much you can't possibly 
keep up. So I think it really becomes our responsibility as marketing people to 
come up with new and interesting ways of getting the attention of that buyer. 
For the last 25 or 30 years, the way we have done this is to place an ad in the 
real estate section on Saturday or Sunday. But we're going to have to do a lot 
more than that in the future. Direct mail is something that we have been 
utilizing in Orange County very successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Direct mail to targeted groups? 
</P>
<P>
A. Oh, you can get incredibly targeted. We have a pretty good concept of who 
the buyers are going to be before we ever open a project. We normally utilize 
direct mail after we have had considerable traffic through the sales office so 
that we can analyze the shoppers and particularly the buyers. If it's a project 
in South Orange County and most of our buyers have come from Costa Mesa and 
Irvine, then obviously we're going to direct the program to those cities. And 
then we target to income and marital status and any number of other 
characteristics. The location within the county has a lot to do with it. You 
market a project in Laguna Niguel very differently than you market a project in 
Mission Viejo. It's a very different buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How? 
</P>
<P>
A. In Mission Viejo you get a much more family-oriented buyer than in Laguna 
Niguel. Mission Viejo Co. has done a fabulous job for 25 or 30 years of 
creating a community image, so you hitchhike on that. In Laguna Niguel, you 
might give more weight to the builder. And then it's further defined by the 
product itself: how the bedrooms are arranged, what sort of a family is most 
likely to live there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If you had a J.M. Peters project and a William Lyon project next to each 
other, would you market them differently? 
</P>
<P>
A. Very different. The buyer that's going to buy a Peters house is, in most 
cases, a much more sophisticated buyer than is going to buy a William Lyon 
house. That's by design. It has to do with the specs of the house, the floor 
plans, the way everything is arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When you say the specs, are you referring to specifications for amenities? 
</P>
<P>
AIt refers to the price and quality level of light fixtures and plumbing 
fixtures, and cabinets and other trim. But even if the two developments were at 
that same price, Peters would do something that's more contemporary. And 
William Lyon would do something that's more traditional. That's just simply the 
way they are. In advertising the Peters product, you would probably have a 
couple without children in the ad. You would probably have a family in the 
William Lyon ad. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It seems that price doesn't get much play in home ads these days. 
</P>
<P>
A. The only time that we really hit hard on price is if there are 20 projects 
for sale and we're the lowest priced or among the lowest priced. But if you're 
pretty much in the same price range with everyone else, it's not really a 
selling point. You're not selling price. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are you selling then? 
</P>
<P>
A. You look closely at your client's homes and at the competitors' homes, and 
you identify the strong part of your client's product. You know that they're 
all about the same square footage and about the same price range, but maybe one 
of your models has a great living room or a really sexy master suite. So you go 
to the product and attempt to find something that is different from the 
competition. And if that is virtually impossible, you may try an ad that 
doesn't even show the product but talks about lifestyle and things of that 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there much of that kind of advertising in today's home market? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, there's a lot of sameness. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And is that because developers fear being different or simply because of the 
cost constraints? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it's a little of both. Developers don't like to be too different 
because, until now, everything's been selling. So the attitude is that if it's 
not broken, don't fix it. And basically, the builders all pay about the same 
for the ground; they all have to put basically the same product on it; they pay 
the same for the infrastructure. If you look around, you find there are very 
few communities with much market segmentation. They sell all of this land to 
all these builders, at basically the same price, and then the builders all have 
to build basically the same house in order to make it economically feasible. 
Whereas when the Irvine Co. or Rancho Santa Margarita goes and does a village, 
they say, 'Okay, Jim Peters, you're going to build homes between this size and 
this size, and you're gonna sell 'em here, and you, Barratt, you're gonna do 
this, and Taylor Woodrow, you're gonna do this.' They take that approach so 
they get a product mix that works and so builder A isn't beating builder B to 
death because they're both doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do people shop developers, or developments? 
</P>
<P>
A. They shop developers and they shop product. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So there really is a recognition that this is a Barratt home or a Lyon or a 
Kaufman and Broad? 
</P>
<P>
A. There's no question about it. And I think those builders that have a very 
strong corporate image will find that it helps them through tough times. The 
buyer knows these names and the level of quality they are connected with. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So how do you market a new builder? If I hired you to start marketing my 
$450,000 two-story, tile-roofed pink Mediterranean-style homes, what would you 
do to move an O'Dell home? 
</P>
<P>
A. Change the name.

<P>
ABORTION: THE ISSUES RESULTING IN THE 'BECKY BELL-ROSIE JIMENEZ CAMPAIGN' ARE 
DRIVING SOME YOUNG WOMEN INTO ACTIVISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The symbols -- bracelets commemorating the dead, the face-etched grief of a 
heartland couple -- are in place. The video has been made. The press 
conference, at least the one in Los Angeles, has been held. 
</P>
<P>
All that is needed now is a million volunteers -- mainly women, college- and 
high-school students -- to demonstrate, sit in, vote and otherwise salvage 
victory in a losing battle for public opinion over one aspect of this country's 
prolonged, divisive abortion controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Allyson Wagner plans to be among the first of that million -- or whatever the 
number ultimately may be. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, Wagner was one of 
about 30 students attending the initial Los Angeles organizing meeting in 
support of "The Becky Bell-Rosie Jimenez Campaign." 
</P>
<P>
This is a nationwide effort that seeks to repeal parental consent laws that 
require minors to get permission from one or both parents before having an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three states, including California, have passed laws requiring parental 
consent or notification before minors may receive abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The California law, as well as those in some other states, is now tied up in 
the courts. But large majorities -- up to 80% -- have supported the notion of 
parental consent in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
Named for two young women who died from complications of illegal abortions, the 
Bell-Jimenez campaign was announced last week by the Fund for the Feminist 
Majority, a national women's group headed by Eleanor Smeal, former two-term 
president of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
The fund has enlisted as spokespersons Bill and Karen Bell, parents of Becky 
Bell, 17, who died in 1988 of complications after an illegal abortion in 
Indiana, a parental consent state. The Bells' daughter chose that route rather 
than diminish herself in their eyes, her parents say. 
</P>
<P>
The names of Becky Bell and Rosie Jimenez (whose death is blamed on a cutoff of 
federal aid for abortions for the poor) will be among those engraved on 
"memorial bracelets" similar to those worn in remembrance of Vietnam prisoners 
of war; the fund plans to distribute the bracelets in large numbers. Supporters 
will be urged to wear them until consent laws are changed. 
</P>
<P>
The fund also has produced "Abortion Denied: Shattering Young Women's Lives," a 
29-minute video recounting the case of Bell and other facets of the fund's 
arguments against parental consent laws. The group also plans to distribute 
thousands of the videos, as well as sending the Bells and Smeal to campus 
forums nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the ambitious campaign's success or failure ultimately hinges on the 
long-term commitment of students like Wagner, who says she is a political 
novice. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, who spent the summer in Los Angeles as an intern with a group that 
works on population control strategies, sees the abortion issue as a possible 
political ignition spark for her generation: "It's an issue I can't ignore any 
longer. . . . For too long now we've been labeled an apathetic generation. 
Abortion or the environment may be creeping up on (students) as a rallying 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner added that she was nudged toward activism last year when her campus was 
galvanized by debate over a stringent abortion law passed by Pennsylvania 
legislators. A further spur, she said, was a disagreement with a friend over 
whether one person can make a political difference, a dispute that she clearly 
wanted to win. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Spillar, the fund's national coordinator, said that mobilizing a 
million student volunteers -- comparable to the anti-Vietnam student protest 
movement of a generation ago -- is "very realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Students accounted for about a third of the estimated 800,000 supporters of 
legal abortion who turned out for demonstrations in Washington, last April and 
November, she said, citing the figures as evidence that students are ready to 
be mobilized as abortion-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
In its opening phase, Spillar said the fund has targeted Massachusetts, the 
first state to adopt a consent law, and Indiana, the Bells' home state. 
</P>
<P>
In Indiana, the fund announced plans to challenge judges who hear requests of 
waiver from parental consent requirements. The fund argues that Indiana judges 
are biased and grant only about a dozen waivers a year. 
</P>
<P>
Other targeted states include Michigan and Oregon, where consent laws are being 
considered, as well as California, Minnesota, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and 
Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of abortion think the fund may have some success with its strategy 
but doubt that students will be important soldiers in the protracted war over 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be more successful at drawing them (students) out to rallies than 
getting them down to the nitty-gritty," said Janet Carroll, associate director 
of the National Right to Life Committee's Western office. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll contended that students are "a very transient population" and that 
voting-age students are "not great at getting out and voting." 
</P>
<P>
The nub of of the argument over parental consent laws is whether such measures 
foster or inhibit communication between parents and daughters. Anti-abortion 
forces argue the laws do promote such communication, while abortion rights 
advocates counter that they drive a wedge between children and parents. 
</P>
<P>
And this is where the Bells figure importantly in the fund's strategy against 
consent laws. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Karen Bell said their daughter was "afraid her parents wouldn't want 
her" if they learned she was pregnant. Becky also told a friend that she 
couldn't "tell mom and dad because I love them too much," they explained during 
one of several appearances in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bell added that he and his wife are "living proof that no matter how 
loving a family is . . . we have no guarantees that our daughters will come to 
us in this time of crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Thrust by a personal tragedy into a national controversy, the Bells seem 
ambivalent about their role. They say that the whirlwind of speaking and 
touring that now consumes their lives has its "healing" aspects. But Karen 
Bell, in Los Angeles for four days, said she was "so homesick I could cry right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Yet in ways they seem tailor-made as symbols in American politics. At 47, he is 
a former high school football and basketball player and was his high school 
homecoming king. She is a former cheerleader and high school homecoming queen. 
</P>
<P>
Before her daughter's death, Karen Bell, 46, also was a full-time housewife 
with little interest in the world beyond her suburban Indianapolis home, she 
said. Bill Bell said he left his job as an office products salesman and will 
devote full time to campaigning against consent laws for about a year. After 
that, he will decide what to do next, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until their daughter died, under circumstances that remain somewhat mysterious, 
the Bells said they were unaware that Indiana had a parental consent law. Nor 
did they know that their daughter was pregnant or that an abortion had been 
performed; they learned this from the coroner, who listed their daughter's 
cause of death as infections stemming from a "septic abortion," they said. The 
person who performed the abortion has never been found. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion foes dispute the Bells' story, citing the testimony of a friend of 
Becky who maintains that Becky did not have an abortion, that she may have died 
of a miscarriage that resulted in a massive infection. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll of National Right to Life referred to this testimony before, adding 
that Becky "certainly did not have to choose an illegal abortion, if that is 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The Bells dismiss these questions, saying they are satisfied with the autopsy 
that indicated complications from a "botched" abortion as the cause of their 
daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they hope that through their involvement in the fund's campaign they 
can counterbalance the oppressive weight of their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want her lying in that grave for nothing," Karen Bell said.

<P>
John Mall sits on a plastic chair inside a small cubicle and faces his 
interrogator. 
</P>
<P>
On the table before him are a plastic foam cup filled with water, two more cups 
filled with cola drinks and a saltine cracker. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the saltine for? Am I supposed to eat that?" asks the 37-year-old Dana 
Point man, sounding a bit wary. 
</P>
<P>
April Newby, the woman in the peach miniskirt across from him, patiently 
explains that he only has to eat the cracker if he wants to, in between 
taste-testing the two cola drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Like a connoisseur of colas, Mall takes a swallow from the soft drink 
identified only as No. 625, washes it down with water, then tries No. 915. 
</P>
<P>
"Which one did you prefer?" Newby asks, her pencil poised. 
</P>
<P>
"The water doesn't count, right?" Mall asks. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of lukewarm response cola manufacturers don't show on those 
hyped-up taste-test commercials. Yet, candor is critical to soft-drink makers, 
who use the taste buds of Mall and hundreds of others across the country to 
decide whether a new cola's going to fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Testing Co., in a corner of the Mission Viejo Mall, shoppers are 
routinely rounded up to participate in such surveys. They're polled on all 
kinds of products and services -- cereals, sodas, frozen foods, cookies, candy, 
facial tissues, garbage bags, paper towels, air fresheners. 
</P>
<P>
"We study everything you can think of," says Jackie Weise, national field 
director for the Wheeling, Ill.-based company which operates 17 research 
centers in malls across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Clients hire U.S. Testing to determine if the public will buy whatever gizmo 
they're peddling, or to gauge how their product compares with that of a 
competitor's. 
</P>
<P>
The tests can be critical or trivial in nature, from making sure the window 
won't shatter on gas barbecues to deciding the size of a cereal box. One recent 
survey, commissioned by the makers of the Trivial Pursuit board game, 
investigated which type of box -- cardboard or plastic -- should hold the cards 
containing the trivia questions. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers' responses can determine the amount of sweetener in a soft drink, the 
fizz in an antacid, the sugar in cereal, the bubbles in beer. 
</P>
<P>
By setting up shop in a mall, U.S. Testing can handpick participants who fit 
the description of whatever group the client wants to survey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to reach all different types of people without going into 
neighborhoods and knocking on doors," Weise says. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping malls would be inundated with market research companies wanting to 
take the public's pulse, but many malls don't want them around. Mall-bound 
research centers are less prevalent in Orange County than in San Diego and Los 
Angeles because exclusive malls such as South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa and 
Fashion Island in Newport Beach forbid any testing on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get into malls. Leasing companies are reluctant to have the 
companies in there. They don't want shoppers to be bothered," says Kay Lavish, 
a partner of the Discovery Research Group in Irvine. "But they're still doing 
it all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
Most market research companies operate the way Discovery does, by using a 
database of names picked at random from the phone book or referred by former 
survey participants and inviting people to their office. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Testing, meanwhile, relies on a recruiter to rope in shoppers as they pass 
by the store. And few can recruit better than Bill Kline. 
</P>
<P>
"I con them," Kline jokes. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kline probably gets more shoppers by illiciting sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him out there and he didn't look like he was having any luck," says Alan 
Schmiz, 26, of Dana Point, who looked like he strolled in from the beach in his 
neon shorts and flip-flops. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed tired, so I didn't want to say no to him," says Juliana Chan, an 
18-year-old Trabuco Canyon resident taking a break from shopping. 
</P>
<P>
People trust Kline, a grandfatherly figure in spectacles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 73 years old," he says, "and most people feel I'm harmless. 
</P>
<P>
"I can call the mothers 'mom' and the fathers 'dad.' And I teach the kids to do 
the high five." 
</P>
<P>
Often, he has to assure shoppers he's not selling them anything before leading 
them by the arm into the center. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, the shoppers sit inside private cubicles to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
"How long is this going to last?" asks Linda Jones, a 32-year-old Mission Viejo 
resident, casting a skeptical eye at her fidgety 3-year-old son, Brian. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten minutes," says Newby, 19. She sets Brian up with a box of toys on the 
floor and serves Linda her soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
"Which phrase describes your feelings about this product?" Newby asks, reading 
from a questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhat dislike," says Jones, choosing from a list of prepared responses. 
</P>
<P>
"What term describes the sweetness character?" 
</P>
<P>
"Saccharine," says Jones, puckering her lips in a look of distaste. 
</P>
<P>
"Its consistency? 
</P>
<P>
"Thick and syrupy." 
</P>
<P>
"How would you rate the aftertaste?" 
</P>
<P>
"Unpleasant." 
</P>
<P>
This goes on for several minutes, then Newby brings out two colas for a 
comparison test. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer the first one," Jones says. "It's real different." 
</P>
<P>
Before mother and son leave, Newby hands them a potato chip clip and a round 
piece of rubber she identifies as a jar opener. 
</P>
<P>
As tests go, this is an easy one for the interviewers. They've been called on 
to test much less appetizing products, such as a new liquid vitamin. 
</P>
<P>
"It smelled horrible," Newby says, making a face. 
</P>
<P>
"We also did an antacid -- that was the grossest." 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers were asked to sip from two antacids and judge them on taste alone. 
</P>
<P>
"People weren't real thrilled," she says. At least one man refused. 
</P>
<P>
Some participants got to taste-test beer and whiskey, but they could consume 
only enough to whet their whistles. 
</P>
<P>
"We had shoppers lined up at the door for that test," says Tony Pointer, 20, a 
staff interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
They've also polled shoppers about a new air freshener, asking not how it 
smelled, but how it looked. 
</P>
<P>
"The company just wanted people to look at it," Newby says. "People weren't 
even allowed to smell it." Most worried about whether the mint green holder 
would match their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Some shoppers agree to take the tests out of curiosity, Pointer says. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell them it's a new product and it's not on the market and people want to 
see what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
The center also attracts participants with token gifts, such as pot holders and 
potato chip clips, even lottery tickets and dollar bills. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many shoppers evade Kline, claiming they don't have the time, even 
though the tests take no more than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's in a hurry," says Claire Engler, field supervisor of the Mission 
Viejo center. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting is made even more difficult because shoppers must match the age and 
lifestyle specified by the client. 
</P>
<P>
For the recent cola test, the soft-drink manufacturer wanted people who usually 
drink regular soft drinks to test an unidentified diet soda. During the 
weeklong survey, interviewers had to query 100 people who fell into specific 
age groups from 12 to 59. 
</P>
<P>
Some tests involve a little extra effort on behalf of participants. 
</P>
<P>
They've been asked to watch a commercial on a VCR or study a print ad, then 
answer questions about the product's appeal. They've received unmarked boxes of 
cereal or frozen entrees to take home, prepare, and share with their families. 
</P>
<P>
The center has a fully stocked kitchen in back of the office where workers 
prepare food and beverages according to the manufacturer's strict guidelines. 
For a cola test, workers check the soft drinks every three hours to make sure 
they're served at the same temperature. Even so, a few shoppers will claim one 
drink is warmer than the other. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all the same temperature, but people's minds play tricks on them," 
Newby says. 
</P>
<P>
She finds the tests are a study in human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"People will say, 'I never drink that brand of soft drink.' Then we give it to 
them and they'll say it's delicious," Newby says. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewers usually don't know what brand they're testing because most 
products arrive in unmarked containers, but they like it better when they're 
told the product's name. Newby has altered her eating habits based on test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found some really good frozen dinners because of the tests," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The staff won't find out the survey results until they see the product on the 
supermarket shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I saw that air freshener we tested in the store the other day. It's 
smaller than the version we tested," Pointer tells his co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the interviewers tested Simple Pleasures, a nonfat ice cream 
made with the new fat substitute Simplesse. 
</P>
<P>
"We had people eating it on the way out. Everyone liked it," Pointer says. He 
wasn't surprised that the ice cream made it to market. 
</P>
<P>
Pointer is less sure about the Trivial Pursuit container. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we won't know until the new Trivial Pursuit comes out what kind of box 
is in there." 
</P>

Military strength -- Due to a typographical error in a commentary Friday by 
Barry Posen on Iraqi and U.S. military strength, the number of tanks in the 
U.S. arsenal was understated. The number is 15,000. And a sentence on

MORE TESTS NEEDED ON CHANNEL WATERS

Tests of Ventura Keys water taken Aug. 6 show that the Keys channels are "safe 
for ocean water contact activities," but more testing will be done, the city of 
Ventura announced. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of a single test should not be considered conclusive, so the city 
continues to advise that users of the channels exhibit caution/discretion in 
any bodily contact with channel waters," said city Coastal Project Manager 
Barbara Fosbrink. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier test had shown that channel water had a "higher-than-normal coliform 
count." 
</P>
<P>
That usually indicates the presence of raw sewage or decaying organisms. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, health officials returned for more tests after a thick frothy 
substance was found in the water. Fosbrink said test results on the samples 
will be available this week. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

YOUTH: BALLET CAMP OFFERS DISCIPLINE AND AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOUNGSTERS DRIFTING 
TOWARD GANGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Bonno was headed for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, his mother says, the 11-year-old Long Beach elementary 
school student had turned sullen and uncooperative enough to raise concerns 
that he was drifting toward gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Then he discovered ballet. This summer, says his mother, Sue Martin, Todd is 
wearing slippers instead of sneakers and practicing pirouettes instead of 
getting into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"It's turned his life around," Martin said. "This is the most wonderful thing 
that could have happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
Chalk one up for the Willie Gault/Long Beach Ballet Dance Camp, which attempts 
to keep inner-city children out of trouble in the summertime by introducing 
them to ballet, an art form few have seen, let alone participated in. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most positive thing that's ever happened to them," said 
Yolanda Rubio Soto, administrator of the day camp run by the Long Beach Ballet. 
"There are no wimpy dancers; by taking control of their bodies they can take 
control of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Selected by teachers and counselors in the Long Beach Unified School District, 
the 60 dance campers, ranging in age from 9 to 14, are considered a high risk 
to join gangs. Most come from economically deprived backgrounds and live in 
neighborhoods in which gangs run rampant. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for the past five weeks, they have been working five hours a day preparing 
for a gala musical and dance performance scheduled for Sept. 21 at the city's 
Center Theater. Called "Say Yes to Dance," it will feature ballet, jazz and tap 
dance, as well as singing. While the performance will mark the end of this 
year's program, ballet officials say, they hope eventually to be able to offer 
the dance camp on a year-round basis. 
</P>
<P>
"They've come out of nowhere to do this," said David Wilcox, the ballet 
company's artistic director, who is overseeing the production. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox was less enthusiastic last summer, when the dance camp began. 
</P>
<P>
Discipline was so lax among that year's class of 25 inner-city kids, Wilcox 
said, that at first he was disconcerted. "They beat each other up, threatened 
each other, stole from each other. I and half the staff wanted to quit," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he said, the young participants got interested in the subject, and 
settled down. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid similar problems this year, he said, the ballet hired Soto, a 
professional dancer who now teaches high school, and several teen-age 
counselors to help keep the youngsters in line. 
</P>
<P>
Still, persuading tough youths to spend a good chunk of their summer vacations 
practicing ballet proved to be formidable. So the dance company called on 
Gault, a wide receiver for the Los Angeles Raiders, who appeared at a series of 
school assemblies in the spring to describe, among other things, how dancing 
had enhanced his athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those of us who are fortunate have a duty to give something back to 
those who are less fortunate," said Gault, who has danced with the Chicago City 
Ballet and in a Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
"This will introduce the art of modern ballet to kids who wouldn't ordinarily 
have such an opportunity. It will get them off the streets and teach them 
discipline, which is essential to anything you do in life." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said 14 of the 60 children enrolled in the camp this year are boys. And 
Gault, along with the Raiderettes, will be performing with them on Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the show, the children arrive each morning by school bus 
dressed in regulation outfits consisting of black leotards and pink tights for 
the girls and black nylon pants and white T-shirts for the boys. 
</P>
<P>
They dance in ballet slippers or tap shoes, depending on which number they are 
rehearsing. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with a half-hour warm-up, the youngsters practice plies, tendus and 
jettes (knee bends, foot stretches and jumps) to the accompaniment of a piano. 
Then, dividing into smaller groups, they rehearse numbers for the show or work 
on their costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Like the instruction itself, the transportation, costumes, rehearsal clothing 
and lunch are free. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet officials put the cost of running the five-week camp at about $35,000, 
raised through individual contributions, various fund-raising activities and a 
grant. Cookie Braude, the ballet's special events director, says she is now 
trying to raise an additional $35,000 to pay for the scheduled performance, 
which is being billed as a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Those who teach the children say that studying ballet will give them more focus 
and discipline, characteristics likely to help them keep out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the young dancers themselves, however, see other advantages as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets you stronger so that you can play football better and ride your bike 
faster," Todd Bonno said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the chiding of some male friends, Gary Goble, 11, said he has stuck 
with the ballet camp because "it helps me jump higher and slam the ball into 
the basketball hoop at school." 
</P>
<P>
And 12-year-old Misty Thomas recently touched many of her instructors deeply 
and, they say, dramatized for them the nature of their undertaking when she 
insisted on coming to camp the day after her 24-year-old brother was shot and 
seriously wounded in front of a bar. 
</P>
<P>
"It was better than staying home and worrying," she said. "Coming here helped 
me to cope."

The wave of defense industry layoffs in Southern California is costing 
thousands of people far more than their jobs. Self-esteem, savings, homes and 
family tranquility are among the first things to go. 
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers might have to leave the area to find comparable work, and 
those who stay may be forced into lower-paying but more stable jobs. Even 
finding jobs in such fast-growing fields as computer programming, health care 
or law will not be easy for many workers who face months or years of retraining 
to make a career move. 
</P>
<P>
Even though thousands have already lost their jobs, the worst is yet to come as 
once-paternalistic employers tighten their belts and chop payrolls in response 
to the slowdown in military spending. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20,000 California aerospace and defense industry workers had lost their 
jobs by the end of 1989, and another 20,000 will be added to unemployment rolls 
this year, according to various estimates. The ranks of unemployed should rise 
to 110,000 by 1994, according to DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Major layoffs announced this year include 2,700 jobs at Northrop at facilities 
in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, 8,000 at Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach 
and 2,000 at Lockheed, mostly in Burbank. Lockheed will lay off an additional 
4,500 workers during the next few years as the company transfers military 
projects from its Burbank plant to facilities in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good time for this to be happening," said David G. Hensley, who 
studies the California economy at the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. "We 
see no booming sector. We just don't see any industry that could absorb people 
-- whether they could transfer skills or not." 
</P>
<P>
The collapsing fortunes of the defense and aerospace industries have left 
workers feeling trapped. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard because everybody is laying off -- Rockwell, TRW, 
Hughes, Lockheed, Northrop," said Brenda Brown, a 33-year-old Carson resident 
who lost her $13-an-hour job at Douglas Aircraft at the end of June. Brown, her 
husband and son plan to rent out their brand-new home and move in with her 
mother until she gets a new job. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a (college) degree, and I'm up against people with degrees making 
$7 an hour," Brown said. "What kind of future is there for me?" 
</P>
<P>
For Brown and unemployed workers like her, companies and communities have 
responded with a series of job fairs, resume and job-finding workshops and time 
off with pay to search for new work. 
</P>
<P>
In El Segundo, the Aerospace Human Resources Network, a public-private joint 
venture created to fill aerospace job openings during the boom years, now 
dedicates itself to helping unemployed employees find work in any industry. 
</P>
<P>
But as the number of unemployed grows, the search for jobs will become more 
heated, and some firms have come under pressure to reduce benefits to departing 
workers. Douglas Aircraft, for instance, gave the first wave of laid-off 
workers 60 days off with pay to find other work. Those laid off in the second 
round in June were not so lucky, having to remain on the job. "We needed the 
hands," a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Searching for a new job will be relatively painless for some workers -- such as 
computer programmers and secretaries with easily transferable skills, say 
economists. Many blue-collar machinists or highly specialized engineers, 
however, could face a long wait in the unemployment line. 
</P>
<P>
"The fastest job growth has been in the service sector," said Steve Weiner, 
acting principal economist at the Southern California Assn. of Governments. But 
"there is a question of the transferability of aerospace skills to those 
industries. That would probably be very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The region's growing pool of unemployed talent has made it fertile territory 
for head hunters. Recruiters for Seattle's Boeing Aircraft -- which is still 
hiring because its commercial airliner business is booming -- temporarily set 
up shop in Long Beach to interview laid-off workers. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing is taking back to Washington state lifelong Californians such as Martha 
Collins, a 42-year-old Burbank native and former Lockheed planner who was let 
go in March. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so depressing here, and it keeps getting worse," said Collins, who will 
be accompanied by her husband but will leave behind two grown daughters. "I 
just look at it as a good opportunity and as a fresh start." 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace and defense industry workers have learned to live with uncertainty -- 
even in good times -- as government contracts ended, commercial projects were 
completed and workers were laid off until the next program was up and running. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty was made bearable by fat paychecks and lucrative benefits, such 
as company-paid technical training and college tuition, that allowed workers to 
enjoy the good life even in pricey Southern California. But now, with peace 
breaking out in many places around the world, long-term prospects for defense 
industry workers are bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Paychecks from Hughes Aircraft paid for Radu Marian's home near the water in 
Redondo Beach and for trips to New Zealand and the Caribbean. But last July, 
after working 16 years in the defense industry, the good life ended for Marian, 
an electronics engineer, with the arrival of a layoff notice. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Romanian immigrant has no health insurance, has fallen behind 
on child-support payments and cannot afford to pay for his daughter's college 
education. In a desperate bid to earn some cash, Marian took out a newspaper ad 
offering his services as a handyman. The only response was from a Manhattan 
Beach family who paid him $250 to build a bicycle storage shed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely surprised that I would take this long to find a job," said 
Marian, whose childhood interest in science and space exploration had led him 
to work in the defense industry. "It's a source of great concern. I have to ask 
the question, how long can I sustain myself or if I can ever go back to work?" 
</P>
<P>
The industry's relatively high salaries have haunted laid-off employees as they 
are forced to consider lower-paid work. Former Douglas worker Jeff Sherman 
dropped by a state employment office only to be told that "they have mostly 
low-paying jobs. I was almost making $16 an hour. I'm rather leery of working 
in aerospace again. However, it is a very high-paying industry." 
</P>
<P>
But with each day out of work, the pressure to bring money home and accept 
marginal jobs intensifies. 
</P>
<P>
"We are eating into our reserves," said Thomas Asada-Grant, a 38-year-old 
training executive at Northrop until he was laid off in May. "We are taking 
money out of our children's savings accounts. We broke into an IRA. At the end 
of August, I will have to take anything." 
</P>
<P>
Former defense workers are turning to the commercial side of the aerospace 
industry for relief from the government-dependent defense sector. But even 
these workers have found that switching sides is no guarantee of protection 
from industry turbulence. Douglas Aircraft, a builder of passenger jets, was 
forced to retract job offers to former defense workers after the recently 
announced reorganization of its corporate parent, McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The tragic thing is a lot of the commercial high-tech companies don't want 
anything to do with the aerospace and defense engineers," said Sandy Lechtick, 
president of National Recruiters in Canoga Park. "The commercial world is 180 
degrees different from the defense world. We've been able to get engineers in 
the door. But we are told repeatedly that any resumes that are defense-oriented 
are trashed." 
</P>
<P>
Wynne Thursby, a 47-year-old engineer who managed a military satellite project 
for OAO Corp. in El Segundo before being laid off in March, is trying to find a 
similar job in the commercial side of the industry -- with little success. "The 
problem is there are not enough commercial satellites," she said. "You're 
fighting panic. You don't want to take a job just because it's a job." 
</P>
<P>
Many workers say they no longer want anything to do with aerospace, either the 
commercial or defense segments. "I'm basically looking for jobs in the state, 
federal and county governments -- something more stable," Brown said. "I know I 
will take a drop in pay, but at this point in my life, I'd rather do this and 
be secure than go through another layoff." 
</P>
<P>
Some find that they do not have much chance of remaining in the industry, even 
if they wanted to. At age 64, Sol Fink, another laid-off Lockheed worker, holds 
little hope of finding another aerospace job. But the onetime Fuller Brush 
salesman says he and his wife cannot get by on the $300 monthly pension he will 
receive after 11 1/2 years with Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try all the different aircraft plants," said Fink, who 
constructed plumbing on aircraft mock-ups. "But they can look at my gray hairs 
and say that I'm overqualified. They are going to go for the younger ones." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for work has become an almost full-time occupation for many. "My job 
right now is to find a job," Thursby said. The Culver City resident keeps 
copies of her resume handy, as well as a date book where she records phone 
calls and letters sent to potential employers. When she is not filling out job 
applications or visiting aerospace job fairs, she works part time for friends 
in the accounting department of their small company. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps keep you from getting depressed," said Thursby, who borrowed against 
her retirement funds to stay afloat until she finds another job. If she stays 
at home, she said, she feels "that nobody wants to talk to me anymore, that 
nobody wants me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Combatting feelings of loneliness and uncertainty is a common trait among 
out-of-work aerospace employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then you do panic," said Norman Gilbreath of Westwood, who was a 
software engineer at TRW before losing his job. "You get these tremendous 
insecurities. The hardest part is knowing you are nearly the only person who 
cares about what happens to you." 
</P>
<P>
Besides triggering insecurities, the layoffs have changed and strained family 
relationships. Asada-Grant now stays home to care for his two infant daughters 
and has tried preparing meals from scratch to cut the cost of prepared foods. 
His wife, Keiko, has become the sole breadwinner with her job as a translator. 
</P>
<P>
"I have become a househusband," said Asada-Grant, who worked for Northrop as a 
training executive. "My kids see me a lot more. My wife says they seem 
happier." 
</P>
<P>
But tensions run high. Many discussions of family problems big and small turn 
into arguments linked to his unemployment, Asada-Grant said. "We have horrible 
arguments. You sit down and strangle each other for 20 minutes, and then you 
make up. Until I get a job, this pattern will recur." 
</P>
<P>
There is a slight chance that the family's turmoil might come to an end soon. 
Asada-Grant is due to hear whether he has gotten a new job -- as a public 
school math teacher.

INVASION RENEWS DEBATE ON ROLE OF ENERGY AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
The crisis in the Persian Gulf has reopened a debate about the mission and 
capabilities of the U.S. Department of Energy, an agency that was born in 1977 
to forge U.S. energy policy, but that some critics assert has long since lost 
its way. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the department has been criticized for its 
initial unwillingness to release strategic oil reserves to restrain oil price 
hikes. Some critics have asserted that the agency has been too relaxed overall 
about the crisis and that its attitude reflects its lack of commitment to a 
leadership role in energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
Some oil experts have argued that the United States should have begun releasing 
oil from its 590-million-barrel strategic reserve as soon as the crisis began, 
to reverse the market psychology that created a spike in prices. While 
President Bush signaled last Wednesday that he may reverse ground on use of the 
reserve, the government's failure to do so quickly has added 15 cents a gallon 
to gasoline prices, former Secretary of Energy James R. Schlesinger and others 
have argued. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy response of the Department of Energy has been as inept as it could 
be," said Philip K. Verleger, an economist with the Institute for International 
Economics in Washington. "It doesn't seem to recognize that there is a 
shortage." 
</P>
<P>
Verleger asserted that the department's stated policy was to begin using the 
stockpile early in a crisis to counter a price run-up. Energy officials had 
maintained that simply announcing plans for an oil auction would restrain any 
rise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Department officials failed to return phone calls. But the department 
has contended that, because of unused worldwide production capacity, no 
shortage exists. "We do not see any reason for a permanent long-term price 
increase," Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said at a press 
conference on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts contend that the crisis will keep prices high for many 
months, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to let the market handle this, you're looking at a 
$15-a-barrel increase," Adam Sieminski, an oil economist for Washington 
Analysis Group, told Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Bush signaled a possible reversal in the Administration's policy on Thursday, 
saying that the United States might go along if other nations decided to dip 
into their reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The department's reluctance to use the oil has brought criticism from several 
sources on Capitol Hill, including Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.), chairman of 
the House energy subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
However, congressional aides also note that the policy reflects in large part 
the attitude of some senior White House officials who believe that use of the 
reserves represents harmful meddling with free-market dynamics. Some senior 
Energy Department officials are known to favor releasing the oil, though some 
also have personally opposed it, congressional aides say. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department was created in the Carter Administration, and Ronald 
Reagan promised during his 1980 presidential campaign that he would abolish it. 
Instead, he shifted two-thirds of its resources to building nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he wants the department in the 1990s to play a more important 
role in energy policy-making than it did in the 1980s. Even some political 
adversaries say Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and his administrators are 
more capable than the top Energy Department appointees during the Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that the agency has yet to take an aggressive role in 
setting national policy. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Department officials have not always appeared in a flattering light 
since the Kuwaiti crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing on the oil crisis Tuesday before the House Energy Committee, Rep. 
Edward Markey (D-Mass.) asked John Easton, the assistant energy secretary, why 
Watkins wasn't present to respond to questions. Watkins, it turned out, was on 
vacation when Iraq invaded Kuwait. He didn't return until Wednesday night, 
congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Energy Department officials released statistics about unused world 
oil-production capacity that didn't jibe with figures that have since been 
released by some oil-producing nations. For example, the agency said, Venezuela 
had unused capacity of 200,000 barrels a day; last week, Venezuela's oil 
ministry said the figure was 500,000 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called on the department in July, 1989, to prepare a "national energy 
policy" by this December. In response, it held 15 public hearings on energy 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
But in June, the department disclosed that it planned to ultimately release a 
series of options for policy, rather than recommendations. The options would be 
circulated to other federal agencies, which would discuss them and recommend a 
policy, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Some representatives of utilities, the nuclear power industry and oil 
companies, who had hoped for a clear statement of national goals on energy, 
complained that this tactic would enable the Administration to duck hard 
choices on such questions as conservation, gasoline taxes and nuclear power.

99 Cents Alleges Trademark Infringement: 99 Cents Only Stores filed three 
trademark-infringement suits against 13 stores in Southern California, alleging 
that the stores used names similar to 99 Cents Only to deceive customers into 
shopping with them. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court suits were filed against stores with such names 
as 99 Cents Dollar World $1.00 and Nothing Over 99 Cents or Less in Los 
Angeles, Huntington Park, Paramount and Maywood. The suits seek treble the 
profits that the stores gained and unstated treble damages. (Filed Aug. 8,

U.S. CONSULTANTS TEACHING CHINA TO WRAP; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: AS THAT NATION STEPS UP EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES, IT HOPES TO 
IMPROVE ITS PRODUCTION AND MARKETING -- AND BE AWARE OF CULTURAL NUANCES.

Consider the "Void Pit Shortbread Biscuit." Produced in mainland China, it is 
reputedly a tasty morsel, and the Chinese want to export large quantities to 
American supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, however, are unlikely to enjoy success in the United States until 
they develop a more appetizing name for the product. After all, the "biscuit" 
is just a cookie with a hole in the center. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of many merchandising goofs discovered by an American delegation of 
marketing and package design experts on a recent tour of production and 
packaging plants in China. The delegation, dominated by Californians, also 
discovered an irony that U.S. trade experts are beginning to acknowledge: The 
Chinese have indeed begun to export more to the United States; but in many 
respects, their success -- like the void pit biscuit -- has a hole in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
Export data seems to show that China is striding strongly into American 
markets. Chinese exports to the United States are expected to exceed $10 
billion this year. That would represent a 300% increase in two years. The ratio 
of U.S. imports from China to its exports to China is greater than 3 to 1, 
higher than any other U.S. foreign trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
However, much of China's sales success in the United States can be traced to a 
massive shift from plants in export-oriented Hong Kong and Taiwan to 
southeastern China. Savvy industrialists in Taiwan and Hong Kong have become 
partners in joint ventures with the Chinese government, building production 
facilities in China to take advantage of low labor costs, said Mike Van Horn, a 
San Francisco-based trade consultant who specializes in Asian investment. 
</P>
<P>
Once workers in China produce and package goods based on specifications set in 
Hong Kong and Taiwan, businesses in those two capitalist enclaves merchandise 
the goods in Western markets, said Michel Oksenberg of the University of 
Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. 
</P>
<P>
To boost exports and obtain more control of export revenue, Beijing is looking 
for ways to improve production, packaging and marketing. As part of an effort 
to reduce reliance on Hong Kong and Taiwan, China's International Center for 
Economic and Technical Exchanges enlisted the help of Kay Lau, head of Kay Lau 
&amp; Associates, a Sherman Oaks-based marketing consultant.

Lau organized and led a delegation of 12 marketing and packaging experts on a 
tour of China's production and packaging facilities in March and April. The 
group held seminars and arranged exhibitions of the best in Western 
merchandising and packaging. Delegation members have continued to correspond 
with Chinese engineers and plant managers, providing advice and critiques of 
Chinese packaging and marketing ideas, Lau said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are very good at producing to specifications set by others," Lau 
said. "The people at our lectures weren't working with Taiwan and Hong Kong, 
and they want to export directly. They need advice and expertise." 
</P>
<P>
A marketing and packaging expert in the delegation, Robert McMath of the New 
Products Showcase &amp; Learning Center in Canandaigua, N.Y., said: "It's an 
ironic situation because environmentalists have been warning Western businesses 
about the environmental dangers posed by too much packaging and too much waste. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese don't need to over-package to get access to export markets," 
McMath said, "but they have to do a better job of displaying and marketing 
their products." 
</P>
<P>
Lau urged makers of the Void Pit Shortbread Biscuit to develop a more 
commercially viable name. There were also engineering problems -- boxes that 
did not properly envelop certain products. 
</P>
<P>
Lau said she also observed many labeling problems. For example, one industrial 
association eager to export had abbreviated its name on the labels of its 
products. Unaware of nuances in the English language, they abbreviated 
"association" as "ass." on their labels, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Lau delegation also noted production-related labeling problems. 
The labels of some beer bottles were glued only at the edges, sometimes leaving 
a sag in the middle of the paper strip. Also, a printing press at one labeling 
plant only had the capacity to produce two colors per press run. If the manager 
wanted a four-color label, the paper strips had to be put through the press 
twice -- sometimes obscuring or dulling the colors from the first press run. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, Qu Xiang Big Jia, a Canton bakery known for quality goods, put 
labels for its products. But the type faces and colors of labels varied from 
product to product, she said, robbing the bakery of a clear identity. And the 
bakery's name -- a potentially alluring trademark -- was sometimes obscured or 
missing from labels. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some Chinese packaging was creative and effective, Lau said. 
For example, the same Canton bakery places cakes in a package similar to a hat 
box. A handle on the top of the box allows consumers to handle the package 
without crushing the cake. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Chinese are going to be major players in the export market, their 
packaging needs to be upgraded and made comparable to what the U.S. consumer is 
used to seeing, because a product's outward appearance is a factor in its 
appeal," Lau said.

JAPAN'S PLANS TO BOOST CHIP OUTPUT RAISE FEAR OF GLUT; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: WITH ITS INVESTMENT, AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER NATIONS, SUPPLY IS 
LIKELY TO EXCEED DEMAND -- AND EXACERBATE RELATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
In their mad rush to position themselves for the next wave of microchip 
production, Japan's giant semiconductor firms may end up clogging the market 
just as they did five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The companies are pouring money into building production capacity that will 
likely exceed demand, a situation that in the mid-1980s forced them to dump 
chips at low prices and sparked a trade dispute with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the firms say they remember their history and are not condemned to repeat 
it. "We have learned a lot from that mistake, and now we know how to control 
prices and balance demand and supply," a Toshiba Corp. spokesman said. "We will 
not make the same mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts are not so sure. They say fierce competition in the 
memory chip game -- from U.S. and European manufacturers as well as new 
entrants in South Korea and Taiwan -- will eat away at Japan's control of the 
market for four-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) microchips. 
</P>
<P>
"Their investments are so great, they will lose money unless they crank the 
chips out. There will be significant oversupply of four-megabit DRAMs by 
mid-1991," said Chuck Goto, senior analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities (Japan). 
</P>
<P>
Total Japanese capital investment in these chips will reach $1.7 billion by 
December this year, which will enable a total monthly production of about 20 
million chips by year-end, another analyst estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Barring an unexpected upturn in the U.S. personal computer market, that amount 
will far exceed demand, according to Dataquest, a U.S. market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Global demand for four-megabit DRAMs will be less than 25 million units for all 
1990 and will rise to 119 million in 1991 and 400 million in 1992, Dataquest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Production by South Korean, Taiwanese, U.S. and European firms could further 
bloat the microchip market. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese makers are likely to control their production, but there is still 
concern about oversupply," said an analyst at a Japanese research institute. 
</P>
<P>
Companies outside Japan also have invested massive sums to compete for memory 
chip technology, one of the foundations of the electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Japan's rivals, demand for four-megabit DRAMs has grown more 
slowly than expected. This lag has given competitors time to close in on 
Japan's waning technological lead. 
</P>
<P>
All the players want to boost output to reduce costs per unit, which would 
allow them to cut prices in hopes of gaining market share. 
</P>
<P>
Already, soft prices for four-megabit DRAMs are pressuring novice chip makers 
to outproduce their venerable rivals. Japanese firms may then have no choice 
but to produce more too, thus increasing excess supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry analysts, however, believe that this time Japanese firms will not 
be left holding the overflowing supply bag that caused them huge losses in the 
mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
The glut hit U.S. firms even harder, forcing many out of business. Washington, 
angered by Japanese dumping, negotiated the 1986 Japan-U.S. semiconductor pact 
in which Tokyo pledged not to sell chips below cost and to improve access to 
its domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo now prizes its relations with the United States and would rather suffer a 
slight erosion of its market share than risk Washington's wrath, some analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is almost no possibility of oversupply of four-megabit DRAMs in the near 
future," said Shigeru Yoshinaka, an analyst at Wako Research Institute of 
Economics.

GAS PRICES AT 8-YEAR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New taxes and the Middle East military crisis have caused gasoline prices to 
jump slightly more than 10 cents per gallon nationwide since mid-July to their 
highest levels since late 1982, according to the Lundberg Survey. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank-based survey, which tracks gas prices at 13,000 stations throughout 
the country, noted that the average retail price of a gallon of gas was $1.27 
last Friday, compared to $1.17 three weeks earlier. A year ago, the comparable 
price was $1.11. 
</P>
<P>
Although consumer groups have complained that oil companies have used the 
Middle East crisis to raise pump prices, Trilby Lundberg said her survey did 
not support that. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg said the dime-per-gallon increase was due to tax increases -- 
including the 5-cent-per-gallon transportation improvement tax that took effect 
Aug. 1 in California -- historically high summer demand and increasing reliance 
on imported refined gasoline, whose price jumped immediately when Iraq invaded 
Kuwait this month. In fact, Lundberg argued, gas retailers have lost nearly a 
cent of profit margin since the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg said that when Iraq took over Kuwait on Aug. 2, the price of oil and 
all petroleum products leaped dramatically on the "spot market," the place 
where oil companies and refiners purchase supplies at prices that fluctuate 
daily, if not more often. 
</P>
<P>
Although oil companies have contractual purchase agreements in place for the 
vast majority of their supplies, Lundberg said that because they do not have 
sufficient refining capacity of their own, they are increasingly relying on 
spot market purchases of refined gasoline to meet increased summer demand from 
vacationing motorists. Further, spot market prices are often used as a 
benchmark for setting other prices. 
</P>
<P>
She said the spot gasoline market saw slight price declines at the end of last 
week and, if that trend continues, consumers may see a dip in pump prices 
again.

OUT OF POLITICS AND INTO 'MARKETPLACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL WEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's curious, to say the least, that an established, award-winning White House 
correspondent would leave his post to anchor a business show centered in Long 
Beach. But 43-year-old radio journalist Jim Angle believes that his transition 
from covering politics to covering economics is a reflection of the growing 
importance of business news in world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, much more than any time in the past, economic reforms are leading and 
pulling along political reforms," he said. "Some even believe that the reason 
apartheid is ending, or beginning to end, is because of the economic necessity. 
You can't oppress a people and expect them to be a productive force in the 
economy. . . . For the first time, at least in my lifetime, economic forces 
(rather than political forces) are dominating and shaping our lives and our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Angle was hired away from National Public Radio in June to replace Michael 
Creedman as anchor of American Public Radio's fast-growing "Marketplace" -- a 
national business show that will move from Long Beach to the USC campus on 
Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the impact of economic issues is the current crisis in the Middle 
East. Angle points out that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was economically 
motivated -- and economically frightening as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The power of economic issues over our lives has been painfully demonstrated 
over the last few days," he said. "Due to the acts of one ruthless man, over 
the last few days we've looked into the abyss of economic ruin. One of the 
points we've tried to make this (past) week is that oil is the heroin of 
industrialized society, and just the thought, just the fear that we wouldn't 
have as much as we could consume sent the entire industrialized world into a 
full-scale panic. We learned how vulnerable we were to economic changes we have 
very little control over." 
</P>
<P>
Angle said that he is as pleased with his new job as he was with his old. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very fortunate," he said. "I covered the Reagan White House when he 
was on top of the world and when he fell from the top of the world with the 
Iran-Contra affair. In both cases, there are some days where you're just going 
to work, and there are some days where you're going, 'I'm witnessing history 
here.' . . . I was very fortunate, and now I feel the same way about 
'Marketplace.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 19-month-old show, produced weekdays by KUSC Radio and distributed 
nationwide by satellite, was recently lauded as the best business program on 
the air by the Columbia Journalism Review. According to executive producer Jim 
Russell, "Marketplace" has expanded from its initial 77 stations to 120, and 
now reaches an estimated 1.2 million listeners over the course of a week. 
</P>
<P>
Russell said the program is targeted at the same type of audience that listens 
to NPR, and on many stations it follows NPR's "All Things Considered," one of 
two shows where Angle was previously heard. 
</P>
<P>
The reputation he developed there has helped "Marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
"Since word of him coming on (got out), stations in Denver, Pittsburgh and 
Memphis have added the show, and Houston is coming on in September, which 
pivoted entirely on Angle," Russell said. "In addition, he has credibility with 
the NPR audience, and some listeners have heard the show and said, 'I thought I 
was listening to NPR.' " 
</P>
<P>
Angle started his radio career in 1975 by hosting a weekly radio program on 
Latin American issues, reaching 155 stations, as part of his duties as a senior 
staff member at the University of Texas' Institute of Latin American Studies. 
He began free-lancing for NPR the following year and then joined the staff 
full-time in 1981. He spent six years on the White House beat. 
</P>
<P>
According to Angle, the "Marketplace" philosophy is that "economic issues are 
too important to be left to just economists." In other words, he said, the 
problem with most business shows is that they are aimed solely at investors. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to combine two things: a sophisticated analysis of what is happening in 
the world and the economy, presented in a down-home way," he said. "For 
instance, we did a story on how much higher (than earlier thought) the budget 
deficit was, and that can be the driest type of business story. But we opened 
it up with a quote from (poet) E.E. Cummings, 'I'm living so far beyond my 
means that we may almost be said to be living apart' -- (and then told the 
audience) that's what budget director Richard Darman said today. . . . You just 
have to point out the impact, and not be afraid to have a little fun in the 
meantime." 
</P>
<P>
Angle keeps "involved up to (his) eyeballs" at "Marketplace," working 10 to 12 
hours a day. It's a pace to which he is accustomed. At NPR, he was the sole 
White House correspondent for both "All Things Considered" and "Morning 
Report," and worked 14-hour days with 15-minute breaks for microwave dinners 
for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no family," he said, "and that schedule is largely why. . . . If you 
just listen to public radio and watch Cable News Network, that's two full-time 
jobs right there. There's so much information out there; I can barely keep up 
with it, and I do it for a living." 
</P>
<P>
Angle's quest is to present a concise, even-handed distillation of this wealth 
of information. 
</P>
<P>
"I have very strong feelings about the role the journalist has in explaining 
things to people," he said. "They want to know what you know. They want to know 
what you have learned on their behalf, going through a thousand pieces of 
information, and they want that presented to them, without deciding for them 
what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad. My philosophy is 
(that) the listener has the right to make that decision for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Angle can be heard hosting "Marketplace" weekdays at 3:30 p.m. on KCRW-FM 
(89.9), and at 6 p.m. on KUSC-FM (91.5) and KLON-FM (88.1).

TODD DONOHO TO HIS CRITICS: 'TAKE A HIKE'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE KABC SPORTSCASTER HAS BEEN BATTERED BY MEDIA COLUMNISTS, BUT 
HE'S POPULAR WITH VIEWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his 13 months as a KABC-TV Channel 7 sportscaster, Todd Donoho has become 
the man critics love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
He's been blasted for delivering his sportscasts while standing in front of a 
video screen, for beginning and ending his segments with a trivia question, for 
commentaries opening with "Take a hike," and for a manner that led one critic 
to write that Donoho, "comes on like a three-alarm fire and is about as 
enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
To Donoho, the whole controversy is a creation of sports television columnists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how a five-second trivia question at the beginning of a sportscast 
can create so much furor among sports media critics," Donoho said. "The furor 
comes from some print journalists who believe a trivia question shouldn't be on 
the top of your sportscast. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think a shoe salesman, accountant or doctor watching analyzes that 
stuff? The only people who analyze that stuff are sports media critics. If you 
try to please them and do things the way they think is right, you'll be out of 
a job." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers apparently hold a far more charitable attitude toward Donoho. 
</P>
<P>
While it is difficult to gauge his impact independent of other factors, KABC's 
11 p.m. newscast has moved closer to long-time leader KNBC Channel 4 in the 
highly competitive ratings race since Donoho succeeded Jim Hill on it last 
July. And "Monday Night Live," a sports trivia program he hosts, was renewed 
for a second season; it returns tonight following a National Football League 
preseason game between the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Donoho came to KABC-TV after four years with the sports arm of the Financial 
News Network, a nationwide cable service headquartered in Los Angeles. He began 
his career in Grand Rapids, Mich. before moving to WLWT, the NBC affiliate in 
Cincinnati. He admits to having been a more conventional sportscaster before 
joining KABC. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a TelePrompTer-reading, condescending sportscaster in Cincinnati," 
Donoho said. But he has adopted a more relaxed style since then. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a philosophy that people would rather have sports talked to them, 
instead of read to them," he explained. "Reading is very condescending. 
Conversation relaxes people more. Therefore, I try to always present an 
ad-libbed, extemporaneous, conversational sportscast every night only because I 
feel people would rather have that." 
</P>
<P>
Donoho noted that he is not the only member of the news team to stand during a 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at weathermen -- they stand up and are very conversational," Donoho said. 
"All their weather presentations are very conversational, they are very visual 
and tell the story." 
</P>
<P>
What about the trivia? His detractors say that with only about 3 1/2 minutes 
generally budgeted for sports, Donoho's questions are a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
"To ask and answer the trivia question probably takes 10 seconds," said Donoho, 
who also poses trivia questions as part of his weeday morning sportscasts on 
"The Mark and Brian Show" on KLOS-FM (95.5). "That 10 seconds is my way of 
getting in one more piece of information. The trivia question almost always is 
about something that happened that day or is relative or timely. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the trivia question instead of idle banter/happy talk/chit-chat 
between news anchor and sportscaster. You'll notice that on our show they go, 
'Here's Todd with sports.' If anything, the 10 seconds is one more fact and 
figure and a little bit less happy talk." 
</P>
<P>
"Monday Night Live" was another target of the critics, coming under fire almost 
immediately after its debut last Sept. 11. KMPC's acid-tongued sportscaster Jim 
Healy called it "The Gong Show of Sports." Financial News Network filed a 
lawsuit, charging copyright infringement of "Time Out for Trivia," a show 
Donoho had hosted on FNN. In its filing, FNN called "Monday Night Live" clumsy, 
humorless and tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
Donoho declined to discuss the lawsuit, which proved to be unsuccessful, but he 
dismissed the importance of critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have good ratings than have critics like it and have bad ratings," 
he said. "The ratings are what keep the show coming back because that means 
people like it. No matter what you want to say, ratings mean that people watch 
and like the program, and that's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
"Monday Night Live" will air after all "Monday Night Football" games, both in 
the preseason and regular season. An edition following the Super Bowl is also 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
There will be two additions to the program this season: a studio audience and 
sports-related comedians appearing each week. Gabe Kaplan, the "Welcome Back, 
Kotter" star who now hosts a sports talk show on KLAC-AM (570), is scheduled to 
be tonight's guest. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday Night Live" has aided the shows following it, "MacGyver" and the 11 
p.m. edition of "Eyewitness News." Before "Monday Night Live," Channel 7's 
post-"Monday Night Football" programming lineup was at the mercy of the length 
of the games, which would often run past their scheduled 9 p.m. conclusion. 
"MacGyver" and the local news therefore would start at unusual times, rather 
than on the hour. 
</P>
<P>

DESERT SHIELD BY MIDWEEK, ACCORDING TO A MILITARY SPOKESMAN IN WASHINGTON.

<P>
As many as 5,000 Orange County-based Marines will be joining the stream of U.S 
troops converging on the Persian Gulf by midweek, a military source in 
Washington said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of fighter jets, bombers and transport planes from the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station will fly directly to join Operation Desert Shield in 
the Middle East, with stops for refueling. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the cargo and troop-carrying helicopters from the Tustin Marine 
Corps Helicopter Station will be sent by ship because of the limited number of 
U.S. Air Force transport aircraft available to shuttle the equipment to the 
Persian Gulf, said the high-ranking military official, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
A small contingent of officers and enlisted men from El Toro, Tustin and other 
West Coast Marine bases have already left for the Persian Gulf to prepare for 
the arriving forces, which are expected to number between 3,000 and 5,000 from 
the Orange County bases alone. Together, the El Toro and Tustin bases are home 
to about 12,000 soldiers and large support staffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say they would be leaving within the next 72 hours, but it could be a 
little longer," the official said Sunday afternoon. "Their departure is 
imminent." 
</P>
<P>
The 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, a rapid-deployment force headquartered at 
the Twentynine Palms Marine Air-Ground Combat Center in San Bernardino County, 
has been on alert since President Bush on Tuesday ordered troops to the Middle 
East to defend Saudi Arabia against possible attack from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The brigade, whose motto is "One call gets it all," includes combat ground 
units from Camp Pendleton and air combat forces from El Toro, Tustin, 
Pendleton, Yuma, Ariz., and a base in Hawaii. It can grow as large as 17,105 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the several bases declined Sunday to confirm the imminent movement 
of troops and equipment, saying they were forbidden to discuss such details. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and their families said they, too, were instructed not to talk about 
their orders, but some said Sunday that they had been placed on standby alert 
as early as Tuesday and have been expecting to depart for the Middle East any 
day. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old El Toro Marine sergeant said he has kissed his wife and 
16-month-old daughter goodby each morning since last week, not knowing when he 
would see them again. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old woman flew from Yuma to join her husband, who had left the 
Arizona base suddenly Tuesday. She said it was the first time her husband had 
to leave without telling her where he was going. 
</P>
<P>
And until he telephoned her to say that he was at El Toro and that she could 
visit him there, she had assumed he was already in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
One Tustin Marine helicopter mechanic said he is on standby and has been told 
that he could be shipped out any time in the next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish they'd ship us out already if they're going to do it," he said. 
"It's the waiting that drives you crazy." 
</P>
<P>
At Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, activity was brisk Sunday. 
Troops could be seen loading military equipment into massive cargo aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Officials there would neither confirm nor deny reports that the base is the key 
Southern California "embarkation" point for transporting men and material to 
the Persian Gulf. But gigantic cargo carriers such as Lockheed's C-141 
Starlifters could be seen lumbering in and out of the base. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Schroeder, a 35-year-old Redlands man who lives near the base, said large 
caravans of military equipment have streamed into Norton over the weekend and 
that the number of departing and arriving airplanes has increased. 
</P>
<P>
"Just this morning, I saw about a half-mile-long row of jeeps going in," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Norton, which is home to the 63rd Military Air Wing Command and one of only two 
military airlift command bases in California, plays an integral part in the 
U.S. "capability to deliver and sustain air and ground forces anywhere in the 
world," Staff Sgt. Robert Pfenning, a base spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
At the El Toro base and throughout the rows of plain cement-block military 
housing to the north, the imminent troop deployment is evident. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you see somebody pulling up with their cammys (camouflage outfits) 
on, and with a great big bag, you know where they're going," said Rachel 
Sweitz, 29, whose husband, Tim, is a sergeant at the base police office and not 
among those on standby for the gulf crisis. "I feel kind of depressed . . . 
just a feeling of sadness, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Military families reported more trucks rumbling through the base gates carrying 
equipment, and three huge passenger jets landing at the airfield in the last 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
One reservist said he has seen several guards stationed at the El Toro base 
entrance carrying M-16s. Usually, a single guard is there with a handgun, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis will be the first combat situation many of the Orange 
County-based Marines have ever experienced. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Marines in particular "are scared -- everybody's scared," said a 
sergeant bound for the Middle East who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been in a war. Most of the people (have) never shot at a live 
individual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most said they felt prepared, however inexperienced in actual combat they may 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"We've trained in all kinds of conditions," said the Tustin helicopter 
mechanic. "We've trained for chemical warfare, but if people are afraid of 
anything, that's what it would be." 
</P>
<P>
At the Twentynine Palms base exchange, a duty officer who declined to give her 
name told the Associated Press there was a run on desert survival knives, 
religious tokens like St. Christopher medals and Jewish stars, and on razors, 
T-shirts and underwear among soldiers on standby for the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is that we've run out of all the health and comfort items. We've 
been bombarded," she said. "We've begged, borrowed or stolen from other bases." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the aircraft stationed at El Toro, Tustin, Camp Pendleton and Yuma will 
be sent to the Middle East because of standing commitments in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Some F/A-18 Hornets, A-6E Intruders and C-130 transport aircraft from El Toro 
will fly to the Persian Gulf area along with highly maneuverable Harrier jets 
from Yuma and fixed-wing observation planes from Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Most helicopters from Tustin will be flown to platform ships anchored off the 
Orange County coast for transport to the Middle East. The largest platform 
ships are capable of carrying 24 helicopters on their decks. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not be that fast by sea but it will take less time than if all the 
helicopters had to be flown there. There are just so many capable transport 
planes available," the military official said. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel from El Toro and Tustin could leave from Norton or from El Toro, or a 
combination. And some "could be flown by commercial charters if the command 
feels they are needed right away," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief task of helicopters in the Persian Gulf conflict will be to move 
cargo -- beans and bullets -- as well as troops. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller, well-armed Cobra helicopters could be used to hunt down and destroy 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The F/A-18 fighter jet is used in air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, while 
the Harriers, which are capable of near vertical takeoffs, are used for 
close-in support of ground troops. The A-6E, meanwhile, is a longer range 
bomber that is capable of carrying 26 500-pound bombs. 
</P>

O'Connor reported from Orange County. Staff writer Matt Lait reported from San 
Bernardino.

The Persian Gulf war of wills settled into economic attrition today as an Iraqi 
oil tanker was unable to dock or load at a Saudi Arabian port. A barricade of 
U.S. warships stood ready to block all trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the embargo is to put the pinch on them" so the Iraqis cannot 
"maintain their war machine," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't give them the essentials that enable them to carry on the war," he 
said, adding that the embargo covers food imports as well as military supplies 
and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials today said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will visit Saudi 
Arabia on Friday to stress U.S. willingness to use military force in the region 
to protect the Saudis from any Iraqi attack. 
</P>
<P>
The visit will be Cheney's second this month. He went there earlier for 
discussions with Saudi King Fahd, and later Fahd invited U.S. troops and 
aircraft to the kingdom to protect it against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
An international quarantine was imposed on Iraq for its lightning conquest of 
Kuwait and its massing of troops near Saudi Arabia, which has the world's 
largest oil reserves. Hussein launched the Aug. 2 blitzkrieg in a dispute over 
oil, land and money. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan voted to send troops today to help defend Saudi Arabia, joining ground 
forces from the United States, Egypt, Morocco and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Squadrons of warplanes and a multinational armada, joined today by warships 
from Belgium and the Netherlands, have massed in the region since Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and Australia said today that they will help the United States 
interdict Iraqi shipping, but France said it will not join the barricade 
because that would make it a "co-belligerent" in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands said it will send two frigates to the area as a symbol of 
solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our position grows stronger with each day," said Maj. Gen. Don L. 
Kaufman, chief of the U.S. military training mission to Saudi Arabia. He said 
planes ferrying U.S. troops and equipment are landing every 10 minutes or so at 
a base in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has called for a "holy war" against the Saudi royalty and Western 
forces now gathering. Over the weekend, he asked Iraqis to cut meat consumption 
in half and to refrain from hoarding food. Black marketeers will be executed, 
he warned. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi tanker Al Qaddisiyah was unable to dock at the Saudi terminal at 
Yanbu on the Red Sea because tugs necessary to guide ships did not appear, 
according to Saudi diplomatic sources. 
</P>
<P>
The same sources said pumping through a pipeline carrying oil from Iraq across 
Saudi Arabia had ceased. The Saudi pipeline was Iraq's last major oil export 
outlet after the closure of two pipelines through Turkey last week. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Iraqi oil tanker Tarik ibn Ziyad was denied access to a Portuguese 
repair yard and cruised toward international waters, officials said in Lisbon. 
The work was contracted before the crisis, but Portugal said it would violate a 
trade embargo.

SOME VACATION: BUSH RETURNING TO CAPITAL;

GULF CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT WILL BE IN WASHINGTON FOR TWO DAYS OF BRIEFINGS ON 
THE IRAQI SITUATION AND THE FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT.

<P>
President Bush will break off his vacation today to return to Washington for 
two days of briefings on the crisis in the Persian Gulf and on the budget 
deficit, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
Bush plans to return to his oceanfront summer home Wednesday after a military 
briefing and speech to Pentagon employees, White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived in Maine on Friday for a scheduled 25-day vacation, but said then 
that the standoff in the Middle East with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would 
probably require him to go "back and forth" to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, briefing reporters at a seaside hotel near Bush's Walkers Point 
home, said Bush will leave for Washington around noon Tuesday and meet with his 
top advisers on the budget and efforts to forge a deal with leaders of Congress 
on reducing the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will hold a news conference to discuss the budget problems after his 
session with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman and others, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The President will go to the Pentagon on Wednesday morning for a briefing on 
the military situation in the gulf, where he has sent an estimated 50,000 
troops, squadrons of fighter jets and a flotilla of ships to defend Saudi 
Arabia and pressure Hussein to withdraw his occupying army from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is leading international efforts to enforce United 
Nations-ordered economic sanctions against Iraq, which has 100,000 or more 
troops massed in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We assess the impact of the embargo as excellent," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez today to discuss the gulf 
situation and world oil supplies, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said Venezuela, a member of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, is stepping up oil production to help offset the cutoff of 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.

PAKISTAN SAYS IT BEAT BACK AN ATTACK BY INDIA

<P>
The government said today its armed forces repulsed an attack by Indian troops 
along the cease-fire line that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir, 
officials said. India denied the claim. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said the attack on a remote observation post in the 
Himalayas occurred Sunday, the day after talks ended between the two countries 
to ease border tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said Indian troops used heavy artillery, anti-tank guns and 
mortars in an attempt to capture an outpost on the KEL sector in 
Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
The outpost is located about 60 miles northeast of Muzzaffarabad, the capital 
of Azad (Free) Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
"Our forces repulsed the attack and inflicted casualties on the intruders," the 
official said, but he gave no figures. 
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, a spokesman for the Indian government denied any fighting had 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not true," said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules. "We have not attacked. We have not used any artillery. We have not 
suffered any casualties." 
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes and small arms fire are frequent along the cease-fire line, but 
Sunday's assault marked the first time that heavy artillery has been used, the 
Pakistani defense official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said India's attack was reported to U.N. military 
observers in India and Pakistan and that defense measures have been 
intensified. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the use of heavy artillery and mortars was an attempt to 
escalate the situation along the line of control to try to divert world 
attention from a Muslim secessionist movement in Indian-held Kashmir, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising, which has claimed more than 950 lives since late January, has 
heightened already uneasy tensions between predominantly Hindu India and Muslim 
Pakistan, which were created along religious lines in the 1947 partition of the 
subcontinent.

A small wedding chapel 2 miles from the main gate of the Marine Corps base here 
has done a booming business in the last week as American troops prepare to 
leave for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing weddings at 1 o'clock in the morning at home in my yard" to 
accommodate last-minute requests, said Shirley Cowart, who conducts the 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Her phone now begins ringing for appointments at 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Since American troops began embarking for the Middle East last week, Cowart has 
performed more weddings than she normally does in a month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very emotional. I think their happiness is just a cover-up. They 
are all just very scared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda Davis, 31, and Cpl. Lee Swain, 21, were among those who exchanged vows 
at the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to his deployment in several days, we've decided to go ahead and get 
married," the bride said. "We'll have the big wedding when he gets back." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Castaneda, 30, and her new husband, Marc, 23, were wed Wednesday night, 
even though they had planned a big church wedding for September. He left for 
the Middle East on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been crying since Tuesday, the minute I found out that guys from 
Twentynine Palms might be going and that my husband might be going with them," 
Castaneda said. "I spent my honeymoon preparing my husband's will and power of 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"He joined the Marine Corps to protect his country," she added. "I know why we 
are there, but I want my husband back."

EAST AND WEST GERMANS MARK ANNIVERSARY OF BERLIN WALL

<P>
At a cross ringed with barbed wire, Germans from East and West paid solemn 
tribute today to the victims of the Berlin Wall on the 29th anniversary of its 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty East Germans died trying to escape across the now-crumbling barrier that 
began separating the city on Aug. 13, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known of them is Peter Fechter, an 18-year-old East Berlin worker cut 
down by Communist border guards' bullets in 1962. Fechter lay bleeding to death 
for nearly an hour before he was hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
"Here where Peter Fechter died, we can feel how much suffering the wall 
caused," East Berlin Mayor Tino Schwierzina said during the ceremony this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Schwierzina stood beside the cross erected as a memorial to Fechter in West 
Berlin. It is near where Fechter lay dying and calling out, "Help me." 
</P>
<P>
A weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony on Aug. 17, 1962, is 
tacked to the dark wood. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people, most of them Germans, gathered for the brief service under a 
brilliant sun. More than a dozen large flower arrangements were placed before 
the cross. 
</P>
<P>
Although the wall has disappeared there, windows in buildings on the eastern 
side still have the bars that kept people from jumping to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, the Communist East Germans marked the wall's anniversary with 
bombastic military parades that drew criticism from the Western Allies. 
</P>
<P>
With the wall vanishing and Germans rushing to unification, today's service was 
the first joint memorial officially linking both sides. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin officials promised that part of the Berlin Wall will be kept 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
"The wall cannot disappear completely," said city councilor Erich Paetzold. He 
said a remainder will be preserved "so that we don't forget."

OZAL TELLS NEED FOR DECLARATION OF WAR ON IRAQ

Turkish President Turgut Ozal said today he does not expect a war with Iraq but 
has to take the precautionary measure of asking for a declaration of war 
because Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on NBC television's "Today" program, Ozal said Hussein lacks good 
advisers to prevent him from making mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to make an estimate for the time being, because Mr. 
Saddam Hussein is quite an unpredictable man, because it is a one-man show in 
Iraq, and therefore we have to take necessary measures in case he makes a 
mistake, you see?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal's handling of the Persian Gulf crisis has been highly popular in Turkey 
despite the fact that it stands to lose $2.5 billion to $3 billion in revenues 
due to its closure of the Turkish route for oil exports from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
A Gallup opinion poll in the Turkish daily Sabah showed 55.2% of the Turkish 
public supports Ozal's decision to enforce the oil pipeline sanctions and about 
the same percentage said they had faith in his future decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the willingness of Turkey to pay the cost of his decision to stand 
against Hussein, Ozal contrasted his position with that of governments faced 
with Adolf Hitler in World War II. "The West gave in to Hitler in Munich and it 
cost much more people later on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Parliament empowered the government to declare war or send troops 
abroad if Turkey is attacked. Ozal said this was a precautionary measure 
required under the Turkish constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal, who knows Hussein well, said a lack of good advisers could leave Saddam 
open to making mistakes militarily.

YOSEMITE SEQUOIAS BATHED IN RETARDANT AS FIRES ADVANCE

Giant 2,000-year-old sequoias were treated with fire retardant to protect them 
against flames advancing today through the majestic forest that photographer 
Ansel Adams captured on film. 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, 1,200 Army soldiers were being sent to take up firefighting 
positions. Fires also burned in Alaska, Washington, Idaho and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Drought and the threat of more lightning in California worried fire officials 
after more than 200,000 acres burned statewide in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
"More lightning means more fires," said Forestry Department spokesman Chris 
Parker. "What we're seeing is the culmination of four years' drought." 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite was declared off-limits to tourists Friday. By Sunday more than 2,200 
firefighters were battling two fires in the park that have burned 17,000 acres. 
The flames were about 10 miles from landmarks like El Capitan, Half Dome and 
Yosemite Falls, and within two miles of a stand of giant sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
Workers tried to protect the trees by clearing debris and undergrowth from 
around their trunks and applying a chemical fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five people fled a park settlement Sunday to escape one of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
Fires have burned 127 structures since last week in California ranging from 
outbuildings to homes. Sixty-six were in Foresta, near Yosemite. The park, 
which usually gets 25,000 weekend visitors, was empty of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a degree of peacefulness, if you are not caught up in the frantic 
business of firefighting," said Jeff Nicholas, curator of Yosemite's Ansel 
Adams photo gallery. 
</P>
<P>
More than $10 million in property has been destroyed by the fires, Yosemite 
fire officials said. The cost of fighting the fire had passed $1.5 million 
Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The park's chief naturalist, Len McKenzie, called the fires catastrophic and 
blamed past park management for the size and intensity of the blazes. By 
suppressing all wildfires in the forest, he said, a huge buildup of dead wood, 
dry grass and other fuel developed. 
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms like those that brought 24,000 recorded lightning strikes last 
week to California were expected to return by Tuesday.

Norway's biggest company, state oil firm Statoil, today reported doubled 
profits in the first half of 1990 compared to the same period a year ago and 
predicted a strong second half due to rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Statoil posted an $894.6-million profit before extraordinary items, up from 
$452.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"With a crude oil price level of $20 to $23 per barrel, the result for the 
second half is expected to be in line with or somewhat better than in the first 
half of 1990," Statoil said, adding that it expected output to increase. 
</P>
<P>
But Statoil said oil prices for the next six months are very uncertain due to 
the current situation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half this year, Brent Blend averaged $17.90 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Fields operated by Statoil make up around 1 million barrels of oil per day of 
Norway's total oil production, which normally averages 1.7 million barrels a 
day.

OPEC EXPECTED TO EASE TENSIONS ON OIL MARKET

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet soon to consider 
possible steps to minimize the impact of Middle East tension on international 
oil markets, the Saudi ambassador to the United States said today. 
</P>
<P>
The envoy, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, told a news conference that consultations 
were already under way among OPEC members on holding an early meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, he said, hopes the meeting will "minimize the impact on the 
economies of friendly countries," but any decision on pricing or production 
would be a collective OPEC decision. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rose today because of deepening Middle East tension, and Iraq issued 
a stern warning to its OPEC partners to avoid production increases that might 
offset shortages caused by U.N. sanctions against it. 
</P>
<P>
London September futures for the world benchmark crude oil, North Sea Brent 
Blend, rose in European trading to $26.02 per barrel, up 55 cents from Friday's 
close. The New York futures market scored similar gains, with the benchmark 
West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery up 45 cents to $26.68 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The threat issued by Iraq to its fellow OPEC members 11 days after the Iraqi 
occupation of Kuwait underscored the disunity of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, whose very existence could be threatened by the Persian 
Gulf oil war. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Parra of Venezuela, a former secretary-general of OPEC, in an article 
for a specialist industry publication joined those asking if the cartel, 
founded in Baghdad 30 years ago next month, can survive the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on Sunday told other members of OPEC "they 
may pay hard in the future" if they raise output above cartel-mandated quotas 
to offset volume shut off by the U.N. boycott of Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is banking on high crude prices weakening the West's resolve in the 
crisis, Western oil executives say. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has yet to confirm Western 
reports that it will defy Iraq and raise its output.

UPS DRIVERS AND HANDLERS IGNORE TEAMSTER LEADERS, RATIFY CONTRACT

<P>
Drivers and handlers for United Parcel Service of America Inc. have ratified a 
new three-year contract, against the recommendation of their union leadership, 
the Teamsters union announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 65,463 to 53,091 in favor of the contract, said Teamsters 
President William J. McCarthy in a statement from union headquarters in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract, which covers about 146,000 full- and part-time UPS employees, 
is retroactive to Aug. 1 and runs through July 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
It raises wages for the average full-time driver to nearly $18 an hour by Aug. 
1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said the Teamsters' negotiating committee had recommended the 
membership reject the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed that the company went to unprecedented lengths to persuade 
the workers to vote for their offer," he said. "In the final outcome, I believe 
that many of the company's employees were frightened by management's ability to 
use permanent replacement workers, or scabs, in the possible event of a 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
UPS, the world's No. 1 package handler, delivers more than 10 million packages 
a day, and made 2.8 billion deliveries in 1989 for $12.4 billion in revenue. It 
has about 150,000 part-time and full-time employees who are Teamsters members, 
out of a total work force of 230,000. 
</P>
<P>
The strike threat forced UPS customers and competitors to develop alternate 
plans. Some customers began shifting their business to the U.S. Postal Service 
or Roadway Package System, Inc. of Pittsburgh, UPS's two main ground-delivery 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed contract raises wages for the average UPS full-time driver a 
minimum of $1.50 an hour by August 1, 1992, to nearly $18 an hour from $16.10.

'THE TWO JAKES' FAILS TO DO LAND-OFFICE BUSINESS 
</P>

<P>
Mel Gibson's fans came out, but Jack Nicholson's didn't. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion many film industry analysts are drawing from the fact 
that the Mel Gibson action-comedy "Air America," a movie that was largely 
panned by critics, did strong opening weekend business, while the Jack 
Nicholson mystery, "The Two Jakes," which received mixed reviews, opened to 
business that qualifies it as a flop. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures' "The Two Jakes," the long-delayed sequel to the revered 
1974 "Chinatown," grossed $3.7 million at 1,206 theaters, for a per-screen 
average of about $3,092 -- and a seventh-place ranking among the films in 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star Pictures' "Air America," which stars Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. as 
pilots in a secret CIA operation during the Vietnam War, took in $8 million at 
1,902 screens for $4,240 per screen and third place on the box-office chart. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest winner among new releases was Columbia Pictures' "Flatliners," 
which earned $10 million on 1,319 screens -- for an average of $7,608 per 
screen. Starring an ensemble of popular young actors, including Julia Roberts 
of "Pretty Woman," the film about medical students who venture into near-death 
experiences apparently helped fill a void in the summer market for 
youth-oriented fare. It was further bolstered by a heavy television advertising 
campaign -- and a trailer that began making its way into theaters in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Another film with youth appeal, 20th Century-Fox's "Young Guns II" -- which 
also boasts an ensemble cast -- performed solidly in its second week, with 
ticket sales of about $4.7 million, for sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paramount's "Ghost" continued to hold as the summer's surprise hit. 
Though the film dropped to second place -- temporarily at least -- it earned 
another $9.4 million. After five weeks, the romantic fantasy has now grossed 
more than $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros.' courtroom thriller, "Presumed Innocent," earned approximately 
$7.9 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the weekend's top 10: 
</P>
<P>
"Problem Child" (Universal), fifth place with $4.8 million; "Arachnophobia" 
(Hollywood Pictures), eighth place with $3.6 million; "Die Hard 2" (Fox), ninth 
place with $3 million; "Ducktales: The Movie" (Walt Disney Studios), 10th place 
with $2.6 million.

LUCAS LOOKS AT TUSKEGEE AIRMEN

<TEXT>
<P>
George Lucas, creator of the "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" movie series, is 
planning a film about the Tuskegee Airmen, the famed all-black World War II 
fighter squadron. 
</P>
<P>
The story of "Red Tails," named for the red paint found on the squadron's 
planes, will be the first in a long-term deal Lucas plans to cut with a studio 
yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure to encounter resistance," he said. "But I'm one of the few people who 
can get this film made. I see the movie less as a race picture than as an 
aerial action-adventure. 'Top Gun' proved there's an audience for that." 
</P>
<P>
The Tuskegee Airmen, formed from a select group of 926 blacks trained at 
Alabama's Tuskegee Army Flying School, was created after the Army Air Corps was 
ordered by Congress to lift a color ban in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The squadron flew 1,578 support missions from bases in North Africa and Europe 
without losing a single bomber to enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Red Tails" also will focus on the pilots' lives once they returned to civilian 
life, only to face continued racism and segregation, screenwriter Kevin 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Overnight, they went from heroes to second-class citizens," Sullivan said. 
"It's a story that somehow got lost in our history," he said.

Marge Simpson's biggest pet peeves are defective shower caps and "oh, yes, . . 
. the senselessness of war." 
</P>
<P>
Marge, the blue-haired beauty from TV's cartoon sitcom, "The Simpsons," reveals 
all in an "exclusive and, uh, animated interview" in the September issue of 
Glamour. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, her favorite way to relax: 
</P>
<P>
"First I lock myself in the laundry room. Then, I put the clothes in the 
washer, watch them go round and round and round, and get lost in the wonder of 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-five minutes later, my whites are whiter, my colors are brighter and I 
feel like the Queen of England." 
</P>
<P>
And what makes this two-dimensional TV star feel sexy? 
</P>
<P>
"A roaring fire, a moonlit walk, looking into the eyes of a loved one over an 
expensive glass of wine," she confided. "If that ever happened to me, that 
might work." 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Broadcasting Co. show was created by cartoonist Matt Groening.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: LEECHES ARE BACK IN CIRCULATION BUT NOT RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and DR. TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am from the old school and believe in preventive maintenance. I 
prefer to avoid pills whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
I have some problems with blood circulation in my legs, and would like to try a 
remedy popular in George Washington's day -- medicinal leeches (Hirudo 
medicinalis). 
</P>
<P>
 Can you tell me where to find them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: When my grandfather was a pharmacist in the early 1900s, he had a big 
bottle of leeches on the counter for a variety of health problems. But leeches 
went out of fashion decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today surgeons are rediscovering valid uses for these blood suckers. They are 
used in microvascular surgery, for example, in reattaching severed fingers. The 
leeches inject an anticoagulant into the local bloodstream where they are 
feeding. This prevents blood clots from forming. The leech also removes excess 
blood that may accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
Whether leeches would be of any use in your circulatory condition, however, is 
hard to say. We can't recommend leech therapy for you nor do we know where to 
obtain the little critters. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My husband has a cholesterol reading way over 300. His doctor is very 
concerned and has prescribed two different medicines, Lopid and Mevacor, to 
bring it down. 
</P>
<P>
He has started complaining about muscle pains and some days he can barely climb 
out of bed. He never had anything like this before. Could it be related to his 
medicine? 
</P>
<P>
A. Contact your husband's doctor immediately! The combination of Lopid and 
Mevacor may lead to a life-threatening adverse reaction called rhabdomyolysis. 
</P>
<P>
Side-effects that have been reported when these two cholesterol-lowering 
compounds are combined include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness. Urine and 
blood tests reveal the breakdown of muscle tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Prompt medical supervision is essential since kidney failure may result if the 
medications are not stopped.

Glenn Close insists she fits the part of a prairie woman in the Hallmark Hall 
of Fame production, "Sarah, Plain and Tall." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to be tall," the 5-foot-4 actress said, raising her skirt just 
enough to expose her elevated boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've added four inches to my height." 
</P>
<P>
As for plain, she said: "I'm a New Englander and I think of New Englanders as 
being plain-spoken and unadorned and that kind of thing. There are different 
interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
Close was in this small southeastern Kansas town to film part of the production 
scheduled for airing on CBS early next year. Filming in Kansas concluded 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
She plays Sarah Wheaton, a Maine woman who answers a newspaper ad from a newly 
widowed prairie farmer in 1910. Christopher Walken plays Jacob Witting, the 
lonely farmer seeking a mother for his two young children. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is based on Patricia MacLachlan's 1985 book that won the Newberry 
Medal for outstanding children's literature.

SANDERS REPORTS TO FALCONS

Cornerback Deion Sanders finally showed up at the Atlanta Falcons' training 
camp today, two weeks after he left the New York Yankees when a $2-million 
baseball deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Falcons spokesman Charlie Taylor said Sanders reported to trainer Jerry Rhea 
early this morning, and then went to an Atlanta doctor's office for his 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
He was expected to participate in the NFL team's practice this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is out $37,000 in fines -- $1,500 per day for missing 18 days of 
training camp, plus a $10,000 fine for missing the team's mini-camp July 9-19. 
</P>
<P>
The second-year player from Florida State spent most of his summer playing 
baseball with the Yankees, who were reported to be considering a $2-million 
contract extension that would have made him a full-time baseball player through 
1991. The deal fell through, however, and Sanders left the Yankees on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who is under a four-year, $4.4-million contract with the Falcons, 
missed the team's NFL preseason opener Saturday night, a 31-27 victory over the 
Washington Redskins. But he is expected to play in this Saturday's game against 
the Cincinnati Bengals at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.

NCAA HEARINGS RECESS, NO DECISION ON ILLINOIS

<P>
After nearly 12 hours of hearings, NCAA officials recessed without dismissing 
any recruiting violations charges against the University of Illinois' 
basketball program, an attorney involved in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA Committee on Infractions began hearings Sunday on allegations that 
Illini assistant basketball coach Jimmy Collins offered cash and cars to two 
prep school stars. 
</P>
<P>
If the charges are upheld, the school's basketball program could be essentially 
shut down for a year. The committee is expected to take 10 days to five weeks 
to issue its final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first hearing before the NCAA's infractions committee in three years 
that has lasted longer than one day, committee members said. The infractions 
committee is scheduled today to take up the allegations involving LaPhonso 
Ellis, who now attends Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Although no charges were dropped, the hearings were cordial and no tempers 
flared, said attorney Steven Beckett. Beckett is representing Illinois 
basketball player Deon Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no yelling or screaming -- nothing like that," Beckett said. "It was 
very long and very thorough." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA alleges that Collins offered Thomas $80,000 and a car to encourage him 
to attend Illinois. Thomas appeared visibly strained during recesses Sunday but 
said afterward he was comfortable with the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole thing went well," Thomas said. "I feel good. There's a sigh 
of relief that it's over, or at least the initial part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they were fair and they'll make the right decision," he said. "I hope 
I'm able to continue playing at Illinois and I can go on with my basketball 
career as well as my education." 
</P>
<P>
Collins is also accused of offering Ellis a car and cash, NCAA officials 
contend.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: DOUBLING-UP SEEMS TO PAY OFF FOR THE 'ICEMAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Iceman," from his table above the finish line in the Turf Club at 
Hollywood Park in the ninth race June 13, watched as his horse, Belle Poitrine, 
carrying the high weight of 119 pounds and jockey Patrick Valenzuela in the 
saddle, jumped into second from the No. 4 post position as the starting gate 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
Belle Poitrine held second against the six other fillies and mares, 4-year-olds 
and up, in the 1 1/16-mile race until the three-quarter mark, when the nag, 
with a sudden burst of speed, rushed into the lead and entered the stretch half 
a length in front. Through the stretch, Belle Poitrine extended her leading 
margin to finish first by 2 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite in the seven-horse field, Belle Poitrine paid $4.80 to win, and 
the Iceman collected $1,228.80 for the $512 that he had wagered. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing cool and calm during the race, the Iceman, who always wears 
sunglasses and dark suit and tie, is a study in inscrutability no matter how 
much money he bets or where in the race his horse is positioned. His cronies 
find him an enigma, totally obscure and unfathomable, because he can win 
millions or lose millions and his demeanor and facial expression never change. 
</P>
<P>
After collecting his money, the Iceman found that he had won $206.80 for the 
day, even though he had lost the first eight races and had ended up with only 
one winner. What the Iceman is developing is a system that he is patterning 
after his gambling in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Iceman doubles up after a loss, which, his friends say, is the quickest way 
to bankruptcy. The Iceman believes, however, that the percentages are with him 
since the favorites, on which he bets every race, win 28% to 33% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he says that, technically, he should win every third or fourth race. 
So by doubling up from race to race, and starting over again with a $2 bet 
after a win, there should be enough profit for champagne and caviar and 
Rolls-Royces and Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
What the Iceman wagers is a sequence of $2-4-8-16-32-64-128-256-512 for the 
nine races. If the favorite runs out all nine races, which has happened on 
occasion, the Iceman is prepared to lose $1,022, believing that he can win such 
huge sums back on days when the system works and when the favorites come 
romping home as expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Iceman points out that he has come out ahead on 47 of 67 days (70.1%) this 
year at Hollywood Park. However, his friends say that, despite the high 
percentage of winning days, the Iceman would be hard-pressed to show a profit 
for the entire Hollywood Park season. More than likely, he is a loser, because 
the favorites at Hollywood Park only won 29% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The losses, of course, haven't deterred the Iceman. He believes that since his 
winning days by far outnumber his losing ones, with some slight betting 
alterations, he will come up with a profitable system that will enable him to 
beat every track in the country. Meanwhile, he continues to double up, which 
his friends consider sheer lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
June 27 of this year was another big winning day for the Iceman when his 
favorite, Jefforee, won and paid a $7 mutuel in the eighth race. Jefforee, 
running 1 1/16 miles on the turf against 3-year-old fillies, broke from the No. 
5 post position and immediately settled into fourth. 
</P>
<P>
At the half-mile pole, Jefforee moved up to third and took a head lead after 
three-quarters. In the stretch, the horse opened up a length but faded near the 
finish to end up first by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth race, the Iceman had to wager $256. His return amounted to $896. 
At that point, after deducting $512 in total betting through the eighth race, 
he had a profit of $384. He then proceeded to wager $2 on the ninth race, lost, 
and left winning $382 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more interesting betting sessions of the recently ended Hollywood 
Park season was July 23, the final day, when six out of nine favorites won. 
Here's how it went: 
</P>
<P>
In the first race, the Iceman won on Stonehouse, which paid a $5.20 mutual, 
giving him a $3.20 profit. No Doubles Match went off at $3-$1 in the second and 
easily beat 11 other horses in a six-furlong sprint to pay $8, giving the 
Iceman a profit of $9.20 after two races. 
</P>
<P>
The third race saw the favorite run second in a six-horse field and in the 
fourth the favorite ran last against eight other horses, cutting the Iceman's 
profit to $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Runnin Blaze, against 4-year-olds and up in a 6 1/2-furlong sprint in the 
fifth, started off sixth from the No. 10 post position. By the half-mile pole, 
the horse was third and, after a sudden move around the far turn, entered the 
stretch a head in front. At the finish, Chief Runnin Blaze was running easily, 
pulling away for a two-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Runnin Blaze paid $6.60 and returned $26.40 for the Iceman's $8 bet. 
Adding $18.40 to his $3.20, the Iceman found himself $21.60 ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Iceman returned to a $2 bet in the sixth race and watched as Cuddles easily 
romped home by seven lengths. The nag paid $6.40 and profit to that point was 
$26. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh race was a loser, cutting winnings to $24, but the eighth saw 
Petite Ile run wire-to-wire to win by a half-length, paying $5.40. The Iceman's 
$4 brought him back $10.80 and winnings of $30.80 through eight races. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, the favorite, Agiwin, running 1 1/16 miles on the turf, ran 
tucked into fourth until the stretch where he began his move. Just before the 
finish, Agiwin overtook the leaders and managed to win by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
Paying $7.40, the horse gave the Iceman a $5.40 profit, which, added to the 
$30.80, resulted in winnings of $36.20 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Iceman says, he isn't committed to a doubling-up system if it 
should prove that it can't win. However, as long as it turns out a profit on 
about 70% of the racing days, he's going to stick with it, because he believes 
that a breakthrough is imminent. It's not like Las Vegas and the crap tables, 
he says, where sooner or later any double-up system has to buck the table 
limit. At the track, you can bet any amount on any race and that's an 
advantage.

COLTS' JEFF GEORGE GETS ADVICE FROM ELWAY 
</P>

<P>
John Elway knows exactly what Jeff George is going through. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big jump from college ball, especially when you make the kind of big 
money I made at the time and Jeff's making. People expect you to step in and 
make miracles happen," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Elway, the first player taken in the 1983 NFL draft by the then-Baltimore 
Colts, George was this year's top draft pick by the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
And like Elway, who has taken Denver to the Super Bowl three of the last four 
years, a lot is expected from George. 
</P>
<P>
"I would tell him to keep his ears shut and don't listen to anybody except his 
coaches and do the best he can," Elway said of the Colts' $15-million rookie 
quarterback. "He's got the talent, and eventually it will come." 
</P>
<P>
George, playing the last three quarters Saturday night, hit eight of 16 passes 
for 82 yards in his NFL preseason debut. He was also sacked three times for 
losses of 37 yards and had two passes intercepted in futile fourth-quarter 
drives as the Colts lost 16-7 to Elway and the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, who played only the first quarter, said George "did good for his first 
game. I think there's a lot of pressure coming on him right now coming into the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to realize he's got to be patient with himself. It's going to take time 
to adjust," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
George's first impression of NFL defenses? 
</P>
<P>
"They're bigger, faster and hit harder," he said.

"It's a matter of getting out there and getting a little more experience," 
George said. "We were pretty basic in the first half. I'm still learning, and 
we stuck to our game plan. The second half, I was more relaxed, and things 
started to happen. There was just good defensive play on their part. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I would have liked to have won," George said. "But everybody's 
learning. We saw some good things and we saw some bad things. But I'm happy 
with the way I played." 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly not disappointed at all with Jeff George's performance," Meyer 
said. "It was a rough debut for him, but I saw flashes of greatness out there." 
</P>
<P>
The loss "was certainly not as gloomy as it would appear, when you consider who 
we were playing. We still have some players who are not here, and I said all 
week that the advantage should be with Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm not devastated by the loss," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Phillips, serving as Denver's coach on an interim basis while Dan Reeves 
recovers from surgery for a blocked artery, said his game plan wasn't much 
different from what the Broncos' normally do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just filling in," he said, "and trying to maintain what we have for a 
couple weeks. So there wasn't any added pressure." 
</P>
<P>
"George had a tough time with what we were doing," he said. "We're a good 
defensive team."
