ORGANIZING STILL A LABOR OF LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago, when Ken-Seaton Msemaji and Fahari Jeffers organized a union to 
represent domestic workers, their friends and supporters applauded the idea but 
wondered if the veteran labor organizers had finally taken on an impossible 
task. 
</P>
<P>
With help from the United Farm Workers union and Catholic church groups, the 
couple organized a small nucleus from a largely invisible work force, composed 
mainly of poorly educated minority women who earned minimum wage. Throughout 
the history of the U.S. labor movement, nobody had ever succeeded in organizing 
housekeepers into a union. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeffers and Msemaji were determined, and they began their venture in San 
Diego, a conservative city not known as a labor stronghold. In April, 1979, the 
couple and 150 members founded the United Domestic Workers union at a 
convention in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Cesar (Chavez) planted the seed in 1976 . . . He was looking for someone to 
organize domestic workers," said Msemaji, 44, who was an activist with a black 
community group that at the time was helping the UFW with a statewide farm 
workers initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Msemaji and Jeffers, 35, threw themselves into the effort to organize the union 
with the same fervor that drove them to adopt 16 children, many of them 
undocumented aliens, in the following years. Fourteen of the couple's adopted 
children are Latino and two are black. 
</P>
<P>
"Our struggle to put the union together and form our family kind of paralleled 
each other," Msemaji said. "When we started both, we didn't have any money and 
nobody thought we could do it . . . We became a union and a family under 
unusual circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started Recruiting in 1978 
</P>
<P>
With help from the UFW, which sent several organizers to help the fledgling 
union, the UDW began recruiting members in 1978. Many of the first members were 
recruited at dawn, as they rode to work on city buses, and at San Ysidro, where 
organizers met Mexican women who crossed the border for housekeeping jobs on 
the U.S. side. 
</P>
<P>
Today, while the independent union's membership is still largely minority 
women, about 33% of its membership is made up of white housekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people thought it was an impossible thing to do . . . Originally, we 
envisioned forming a union for maids and housecleaners. After a while, we 
realized that in order to organize them, we had to have a stronger base of 
support," Msemaji said. 
</P>
<P>
In order to build a support base from which to grow, the UDW began focusing on 
home attendants from the government-funded In Home Support Services program. 
The IHSS program, designed to provide home care for the aged and disabled poor 
who cannot afford convalescent care, is financed by the state and administered 
by the counties. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jeffers, who is also an attorney, admitted that the first results were 
more humbling than encouraging. The union's first election in September, 1979, 
at a local nursing home, was lost by one vote. It was more than a year later, 
in November, 1980, before the UDW signed its first collective bargaining 
agreement, covering 2,000 home attendant workers contracted by San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years later, the union's membership has grown modestly to 5,000 workers -- 
there are about 130,000 home attendants in the state -- but its influence has 
been felt throughout California. Currently, its paid membership is composed 
exclusively of workers who work for companies that contract with California 
counties for in-home care for aged and disabled people. The overwhelming 
majority of home attendants in California are "private providers," who do not 
have union representation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fighting for workers' rights, Jeffers is also fighting a more 
personal battle with a debilitating disease. Jeffers suffers from myasthenia 
gravis, a disease of the muscles that strikes its victims in the form of mild 
twitches and which can make chewing, swallowing and breathing difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The disease has hospitalized Jeffers on several occasions, but she refuses to 
be conquered by it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a disease that has a cure. It's a constant threat, but I can overcome 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Home attendants represented by the UDW earn about $5 an hour, but their 
benefits include paid vacations and a health plan. In comparison, private 
providers usually earn minimum wage -- $4.25 an hour -- without benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Although the UDW's roots are planted firmly in the progressive labor movement, 
the union has been able to survive in an era that has sent many unions reeling 
largely because of Jeffers and Msemaji's insistence on developing bipartisan 
support on issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diverse Group of Supporters 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, UDW supporters have included politicians of diverse 
political views, such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson 
(R-Fullerton), Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) and conservative San Diego 
businessman James C. Schmidt, vice chairman of the board of Great American 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a constituency base that is naturally Democratic, yet they're in a 
special circumstance in terms of supporting privatization, which historically 
has been identified with Republican policy," said Assemblyman Steve Peace 
(D-Chula Vista). "They appeal to Republicans who like to see jobs stay in the 
private sector and Democrats who like to see jobs going to people who are more 
often identified as a Democratic constituency." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Jeffers and Msemaji's Republican supporters were 
instrumental in persuading Gov. George Deukmejian to block a $64-million cut 
proposed by his staff in the state's $575-million in-home support program. Had 
the cuts been made, an estimated 5,000 contract workers, many of them UDW 
members, would have lost their jobs. It was the single biggest threat that the 
union has faced to date, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's advisers had argued that the state could save $64 million if it 
did away with contract workers and hired private providers who are paid 
directly by the counties. In addition to the savings, Deukmejian's aides said 
that private providers could do the job more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"In all probability, that would've meant the end of the union . . . We had to 
persuade our legislators in Sacramento, and the governor's closest political 
allies, that contract workers are more cost effective," Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
The UDW mobilized statewide support to save the contract program, and 
consequently, the union. Former Republican Congressman Clair W. Burgener's 
letter to the governor was typical of the political support received by the 
union on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be detrimental to our economy to have more than 5,000 people, many of 
whom choose work over welfare, lose their jobs, and to have the more than 
20,000 elderly people for whom they provide care, end up in more costly 
institutions," Burgener wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling said that he was impressed by Msemaji's and Jeffers' ability to work 
both sides of the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, it surprised me that they were that politically 
sophisticated. But after knowing them for a while and, on reflection, my 
surprise was due to my lack of knowledge about them and not theirs. They are an 
extraordinary couple," Stirling said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heap Praise on Couple 
</P>
<P>
Msemaji's and Jeffers' supporters lavish praise on the couple and the union. 
While praise for the pair and their organizing activities are to be expected 
from their liberal supporters, some of their biggest backers are conservative 
businessmen, not the type who would usually support labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Ken for some time and am very impressed with him," said Great 
American's Schmidt. "The fact that he runs a very cost-effective operation and 
members of the union provide a very needed service impresses me . . . Support 
for him and the union is almost universal." 
</P>
<P>
"Their bottom line is the workers," Peace said. "Ken and Fahari are people who 
have been through it all. They are union leaders who are truly not motivated by 
money. They have a very modest life style." 
</P>
<P>
Both Jeffers and Msemaji are very private people, who, according to their 
supporters seldom talk about themselves. Msemaji appeared embarrassed when 
asked about the children he and his wife have adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all good kids. They needed somebody's help when we came along, and 
I'm thankful to God that we were able to help. I'm not going to tell you that 
having a family this large is easy, because it's not. But Fahari and I have 
never regretted the move we made," Msemaji said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple is also devoutly religious. Msemaji, who was raised in Watts, is a 
lifelong Roman Catholic, and Jeffers, a self-described Navy brat who was born 
at the old Naval Hospital in San Diego, was baptized a Catholic last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ties to the church, both in our professional and private lives, are very 
strong. This union could not have succeeded without the help that we received 
from the church early on. Besides Cesar Chavez, they were the only ones who 
believed in us when nobody else did," Jeffers said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: YAFERS PUT SONG IN THEIR HEART, FROWN ON HIS FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Young Americans for Freedom have left San Diego after their convention, 
taking Ollie North and Fawn Hall with them. 
</P>
<P>
But their songs are still ringing in Stephan Brown's ears. He is not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 37, a San Diego native and owner of an energy equipment firm, and his 
girlfriend were at the Hungry Hunter restaurant in Mission Valley for a 
nightcap. So were several dozen YAFers, having a merry time and singing YAF 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
Songs like "Fightin' Joe McCarthy," "The John Birch Society Hymn," "The 12 
Adulteries of Gary Hart," "Sweet Selma Levine," "Ode to Mary Jo" 
(Chappaquiddock is a big YAF theme), and "The Christmas Song of 1985," which 
starts thusly: 
</P>
<P>
Oh, you'd better watch out 
</P>
<P>
 You homos and bi's, 
</P>
<P>
 You'd better watch out, 
</P>
<P>
 We're telling you guys, 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS patrol is coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood, Brown said, was ugly. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys were one beer away from a lynching," he said. "That was their 
mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Poppycock, said Barry Jantz of La Mesa, statewide YAF chairman. He was there. 
The songs are meant to be funny, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, the songs are kind of wild," said Jantz. "It's supposed to be. We have 
the ability to laugh at ourselves. We find oftentimes the left wing doesn't 
have a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Jantz feels protective toward the YAF songbook. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote two of its more lusty entries: "The Kennedy Killbilly" ("Come and 
listen to a story 'bout a man named Ted/A rich senator, likes to kiss the ass 
of Reds") and "Khadafy the Dirty Maggot."If You Missed These. . .

</P>
<P>
Seems to Like the Heat 
</P>
<P>
Meet the latest media celebrity: William E. Berry of La Mesa, 61, Korean War 
veteran, travel agency owner, and man of strong opinions. 
</P>
<P>
He's been the target of a "Gay Times" article, a Perspective by Michael Tuck 
and a flurry of angry phone calls to Roger Hedgecock's radio show. His Kiwanis 
Club mildly rebuked him, and a man showed up at his door with a yellow rose 
(said to be a symbol of animosity). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to worry about it," Berry says. "It's going to blow over and the 
hysterics will die down." 
</P>
<P>
To Berry, he's the victim of narrow minds who can't stand an opposing opinion. 
To his critics, he's homophobic and politically retrograde, a purveyor of what 
Tuck called "a little piece of trash." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's called the Kiweekly, the newsletter of the Kiwanis Club of La 
Mesa, "the newspaper with a heart," circulation about a hundred. Berry was the 
volunteer editor-reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least he was until the most recent edition came off the mimeograph. 
</P>
<P>
That's the edition that mentions "fags," "thieves in Congress," drunken golf 
cart drivers, politicians who give tax money to "the idle, ignorant and 
indolent," and a woman who is "in the country legally and knows her place." 
</P>
<P>
The La Mesa Kiwanis issued a statement saying that Berry's opinions "do not 
reflect the opinions or views" of the club. Beyond that, club president Bob 
Battenfield, who runs a public relations firm, won't comment. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's not bellicose about it all, but neither is he backing down, not even 
from his modest proposal that more money be spent on AIDS "so the park 
restrooms will once again be safe for self-respecting fags." 
</P>
<P>
His journalism career now over and his 5 minutes of fame fleeting, Berry has 
two regrets: One, that he didn't get to meet Tuck personally (he's a fan). And 
two, that people zeroed in only on the most recent Kiweekly. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have seen my edition about Iran," Berry said. "I said there were 
two pieces of great news from Iran: the Ayatollah had died and they executed 12 
dope-dealers."

MAN WOUNDED AFTER FIRING AT OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego police officers shot and critically wounded an unidentified man 
in a Sunday afternoon shoot-out, according to a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The officers had spotted the man brandishing a shotgun near the corner of 47th 
and Market streets about 3:53 p.m., said San Diego police spokesman David 
Cohen. When they approached the man on a nearby lot, he turned and fired, 
missing both patrolmen, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Eric Hayes, 24, and Randy Burgess, 27, returned fire with six shots, 
Cohen said. One bullet struck the man's neck and two more hit his chest, said 
Mercy Hospital spokeswoman Debbie Seitz. 
</P>
<P>
The man underwent surgery Sunday evening and was listed in critical condition, 
Seitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes and Burgess are both three-year veterans of the police force.

KISSINGER'S VIEW OF CHINA CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kissinger's Opinion piece reveals once again Kissinger's consistent refusal to 
support human rights or promote democracy beyond our own borders. Kissinger's 
repeated failure to stand for these principles is only exceeded by his 
dependable support for status quo governments, no matter how bloody and 
repugnant. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger praises Deng while obscuring his own past on this issue. Remember, he 
was the architect of doing business with Mao. Kissinger defends Deng's bloody 
crackdown by claiming, "No Government in the world would have tolerated . . . 
(the demonstration)." Perhaps Kissinger has been in the company of totalitarian 
dictators so long that he has forgotten the basic principles of democratic 
society. One only needs to look in front of the White House, where 
demonstrators from various causes have held year-long vigils. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, Kissinger's support for the "important" relationship with repressive 
totalitarian dictators conflicts with what democracy leaders from Beijing to 
Moscow and all points around have been telling us: "Stop undermining our 
efforts, stop trading and financing with our repressors.

LAW BY INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The initiative was created in the Progressive Era as a populist device to write 
state laws when the legislative and executive branches failed to act. 
California's initiative was introduced, with other reforms, to break the 
control of the railroads over state government. With enlightened political 
leadership, the initiative would not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13, the property tax amendment of 1978, was an example of a 
populist uprising. State government failed to respond to a real, critical 
issue. The people revolted and changed the law. Since then, legislators and 
governors have become unwavering advocates of property tax limits. 
</P>
<P>
As time passed, political candidates recognized the potential benefit -- 
sometimes the absolute necessity -- of either associating themselves with 
initiative petition measures that would appear on the same ballot, or 
distancing themselves as far as possible. A gun-control measure on the 1982 
ballot may have won the governorship for Republican George Deukmejian over 
Democrat Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles. Four years later, Bradley took 
the candidate-initiative nexus a step further. His own campaign helped draft 
Proposition 65, the anti-toxics initiative, and attempted to use it as a 
vehicle for electing him governor. Proposition 65 passed, but Bradley was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as the 1990 campaign for governor gathers momentum, candidates and 
initiatives are being wrapped into single packages. One obvious advantage is 
for the candidate to become intimately identified with a popular issue: 
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson with an anti-crime measure, for instance, and 
Democratic Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp with a sweeping environmental proposal. 
Superficially, that seems innocent enough. Too often, however, it is difficult 
to determine just what a candidate stands for. But this is not the way to 
restore public confidence in the political process. And there is no crisis in 
either the criminal justice or environmental areas that would justify such 
sweeping revision by voter initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is clear that another motive may be involved: to use the initiative as a 
means of skirting state laws restricting the amount of money individuals and 
committees can give a candidate's campaign. There are no limits on 
contributions to initiative drives. With candidates associating themselves with 
initiative measures from the outset, money raised and spent in behalf of the 
initiative measure can be virtually as potent as money spent directly on the 
candidate's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson supporters can give both directly to his campaign and to the anti-crime 
initiative drive. Van de Kamp backers can do the same. Having the choice of two 
initiatives, he is planning to sponsor -- the catch-all environmental measure 
and a political ethics and reform proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature should consider imposing limits on individual and corporate 
contributions to initiative campaigns, not just because of the 
candidate/initiative association, but because special-interest spending on 
initiative campaigns already had soared out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The candidate/initiative link also is cause for concern on a more esoteric 
political level. A major reason for the proliferation of initiative campaigns 
in recent elections is the lack of concerted leadership in Sacramento. Citizen 
groups, and even legislators themselves, have given up on the ability of the 
governor and legislators to work together on a variety of urgent issues. They 
have short-circuited the process to write new laws themselves via well-financed 
initiative campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates for governor who say they will offer California strong new 
leadership from the executive office are subverting that very notion by 
becoming candidates by initiative. Van de Kamp even has hurt his potential for 
working with fellow Democrats in the Legislature by proposing in his reform 
measure that legislators' terms be limited. Lawmakers are furious with him for 
trying to boost his political career by suggesting that theirs be cut short. 
</P>
<P>
California desperately needs leadership that will restore people's confidence 
in the political process. Trying to ride into office on the coattails of an 
initiative petition campaign is not the way.

A THINK TANK FOR THE NEW WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone's notion of the West is different, but most personal concepts have 
strong ties to both the facts and myths of the American frontier. One of the 
facts has been that considerable public policy affecting the West has been 
developed and implemented in the East: from Harvard and Yale, Wall Street, the 
federal Establishment and Washington-based think tanks. This policy usually has 
centered around the West's land and natural resources without much thought 
given to the residue of exploitation. And the concept has not changed much in 
the public mind despite the new frontier built on the basis of economic, 
technological, scientific and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
A vigorous effort is under way to change that perception and develop a new 
identity for the West as a window on the Pacific world. The event is the 
creation of a research and consulting institute based in Denver and called the 
Center for the New West. While billed as a public/private partnership, the 
primary motivation for this new western think tank came from US WEST, the 
14-state Bell operating company created out of the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984. 
US WEST, working with a former official of the Western Governors' Assn., 
developed a precursor group called the Western States Strategy Center to 
address economic development and public policy issues in the western states. 
This has evolved into the Center for the New West, which is affiliated with a 
number of public groups including the western governors, Western States' Water 
Council and Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. 
</P>
<P>
The center is strongly market-oriented, with an emphasis on assisting small and 
medium-sizedbusinesses striving for success in a rapidly changing global 
economy. Center officials say they reject the notion -- which they claim is too 
prevalent in the East -- that the United States is doomed to an ever-declining 
role in the global economy. "Our purpose is to inject sound ideas and 
strategies for the future prosperity of the West into the public dialogue," 
according to its goals. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that US WEST will benefit from economic prosperity in its 
14-state territory. But the center also can serve a broad western interest in 
many ways. One way certainly is the use of telecommunications to create new 
forms of economic development in small cities and towns throughout the West 
that have suffered through the boom-and-bust cycles of resource exploitation. 
To develop the credibility it seeks, the center also needs to pay careful 
attention to the history, culture and environment of the West. 
</P>
<P>
There is some encouragement to be found in the center's first newsletter. One 
article, by senior fellow Leonard Slosky, says the center will explore ways to 
expand the economy of the West "while upgrading protection of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Californians often tend to look down on other western states as economic 
stepchildren who have no choice but to deal with or through the Golden State on 
trade matters. The state should consider the benefits of participation in the 
Center for the New West. The economic vigor of places like Denver, Salt Lake 
City, Phoenix and Honolulu will contribute to California's health as well. And 
California -- as a resource exploiter of the West -- should work with other 
western states on environmental protection and cultural development.

NIXON LEFT HIS MARK, AND IT IS ALL AROUND US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER MORRIS, Roger Morris' Richard Milhouse Nixon: The Rise of an American 
Politician, 1913-1952, the first of a three-volume biography, will be published 
this fall by Henry Holt &amp; Co. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a dramatic, unparalleled scene in the history of American politics. The 
choked, emotional farewell to the last of the loyal White House staff, the red 
carpet rolled out to the waiting helicopter on the South Lawn. Then, with a 
last characteristic wave at the door, Richard M. Nixon, who had been with us 
somewhere on the national stage for so long, was suddenly gone. The 37th 
President of the United States had resigned from office under the threat of 
impeachment, soon to be saved from a likely criminal conviction only by the 
controversial pardon by his successor and old friend, Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, it seems almost surreal, this constitutional crisis of the 
century. In part, of course, time has blunted and blurred the images. And Nixon 
himself, as he did again and again in his remarkable career, has staged 
something of another skillful and fiercely determined comeback in public 
relations. After the bipartisan ineptitude and relative dimness of his 
successors, there is a sort of nostalgia for his old diplomatic initiatives 
toward the Soviet Union or China, and even what seemed clear villainy 15 years 
ago now takes on the soft tint of competence and decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the dramatic Nixon foreign policy does not deserve careful study -- 
though there may have been, as Tallulah Bankhead used to say, less here than 
meets the eye. His mutual propping with Leonid S. Brezhnev's corrupt and 
sclerotic government may only have delayed and obstructed the liberalization we 
now see unfolding in the Soviet Union, and the savage repression in China shows 
all too clearly the character of the regime he embraced so expediently in 
Beijing in 1972. It was also Nixon who instituted in earnest the covert little 
Punic and proxy wars that now pass for our foreign policy in the Third World, 
who presided over the first, perhaps fatal decline in our international 
competitiveness and currency strength, whose refracted Realpolitik with Henry 
Kissinger roundly ignored the vast problems of poverty, migration, and 
environmental decay that threaten to overwhelm statesmanship in the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, his proteges, and his mark, are everywhere -- from a defeated 
young Texas politician named George Bush whom he rescued from oblivion in 1970 
and named to the U.N. ambassadorship, to Chief Justice William Rehnquist and 
his conservative majority on the Supreme Court, or to the former Kissinger 
aides and clients who now crowd the upper levels of the National Security 
Council and the State Department, guiding the otherwise-frozen hands of an 
uncertain new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the real danger to memory and history is not in romanticizing Nixon's 
global strategies, or mistaking his considerable patronage. The problem goes 
much deeper, coming home to the nation and body politic we truly are -- and to 
how much this once-disgraced, fallen President made us so. 
</P>
<P>
For it was also Nixon who largely wrought the Republican revolution in the 
South and the West, and thus redrew the map of America's Electoral College 
politics that gave us Ronald Reagan and George Bush. More than any other 
politician of the era, it was Nixon who led and rode the huge tides of 
anti-communist fear and reaction, and the great-if-furtive counterrevolution 
against the racial and social upheavals of postwar America -- all of which have 
driven the Democratic Party into a political wilderness from which it has yet 
to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
And back further still, in the brilliant and tireless young politician he was 
at his beginnings, it was Richard Nixon who represented above all the elemental 
forces of corporate power, finance, agribusiness and energy, who epitomized the 
manipulative might of the media in politics, who in California in so many ways 
pioneered the use and masking of great money in political campaigning. And, 
above all, who artfully tapped the insidious prejudice, vengeance and smear 
mentality in American politics long before Bush ran his effective ads against 
Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon is never going to be the most beloved American President of the 
century. But he is going to turn out to be the quintessential politician of the 
epoch, and most of what he really embodied is in the ascendancy. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a long time since they rolled up that red carpet from the departing 
helicopter, but he is with us still. And in the end, in ways yet little 
understood, he has probably won.

YOUTH CRITICALLY WOUNDED AT PALMDALE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth was in critical condition after being shot in the chest 
Sunday at a Palmdale party in what authorities believe was part of a weekend of 
gang-related confrontations in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the youth, Darryl Riley, might have been acting as a good Samaritan when he 
was shot by Juan Lomeli, 22, shortly after midnight at a party in the 37200 
block of Populus Avenue, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Lomeli, who was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, shot Riley after the 
youth intervened in an argument between Lomeli and Danielle Sanchez, 19, said 
Sgt. Terry Judge. Lomeli was beating Sanchez, his girlfriend, because she had 
danced with another man, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
When Riley tried to stop Lomeli from hitting the woman, Lomeli shot him with a 
.38-caliber revolver handed to him by Gilbert Rodriquez, 22, the host, who also 
was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, deputies said. Riley collapsed 
onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Girlfriend Shot 
</P>
<P>
Lomeli then turned on his girlfriend and shot her in the left shoulder before 
fleeing in her car, Judge said. She was treated and released at a nearby 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Just 24 hours earlier, Rodriquez's brother David, a suspected gang member, was 
shot at after he witnessed a fistfight between members of two rival gangs in 
the parking lot of a Lancaster toy store, said Deputy Ronald Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
While David Rodriquez and two friends were driving home after the incident, a 
car overtook them, and a passenger fired nine shots into their vehicle, 
deputies said. Rodriquez and his friends were slightly injured by shattered 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Freddy Ruiz, 18, and a 16-year-old, whose name was not released, were arrested 
on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with the incident, Thomason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An hour after the apparent attempt on David Rodriquez's life, Freddy Ruiz's 
mother received an anonymous phone call at her Quartz Hill home, Thomason said. 
The caller threatened to kill Ruiz and other members of his gang. At 4:30 a.m. 
Saturday, 30 gunshots, including shotgun blasts and .22-caliber bullets, were 
fired into a bedroom at Ruiz's house. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, Thomason said, and no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they suspect there is a link between the shooting of Darryl 
Riley and the earlier incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"We know they are all connected, we just don't know how yet," Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
After fleeing the party, Lomeli led authorities on a short car chase that ended 
when he crashed Sanchez's car into a bridge at Avenue S and 20th Street East, 
deputies said. He abandoned the car and fled. Police dogs found him about 2 1/2 
hours later, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lomeli was taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center for treatment of 
wounds inflicted by the police dogs. Riley was being treated at Palmdale 
Community Hospital.

REAPING REWARDS OF THE WILL TO ACT; 
</P>
<P>
CITIZEN ACTIVISTS SAY INVOLVEMENT TRANSFORMS THEIR LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lupe Lopez knew that, by herself, she could not stop the drug dealing in her 
Canoga Park neighborhood. Neither could she make City Hall politicians listen 
to her complaints about potholes or unsightly abandoned cars. 
</P>
<P>
But the 61-year-old grandmother of four said she stopped feeling powerless last 
year when she joined VOICE, Valley Organized in Community Efforts, an 
organization made up of members of 15 San Fernando Valley churches and 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know we could do something before," said Lopez, a receptionist at a 
Canoga Park youth center. "I found out that if we stand together with certain 
values, we can do something to change the things around us." 
</P>
<P>
VOICE has won a few victories since its founding at a boisterous meeting 
attended by 1,200 people in November. San Fernando city officials agreed in 
April to spruce up a neglected park and increase police patrols. Earlier this 
year, Los Angeles city officials agreed to a VOICE request and established a 
toll-free number for reporting abandoned cars for removal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Changes 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the group's political accomplishments, Lopez and other members say 
the organization has quietly and unexpectedly transformed their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and other members of the group said that before VOICE was formed, they 
were content to help with prayer meetings and catechism classes. Now, they say, 
they are part-time community activists who dedicate much of their non-working 
lives to group meetings and public hearings, where they speak before -- and 
sometimes confront -- politicians and bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez attends weekly meetings of VOICE's media committee, which she said is 
preparing for an anti-graffiti campaign expected to be launched this fall. 
"I've gone to so many meetings I have to look at this to remember what we've 
done," she said, leafing through a notebook filled with newspaper clippings, 
mimeographed flyers and pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, practically all of those pulled into VOICE's ranks -- including 
accountants, priests and insurance company employees -- say they are frustrated 
with government inaction on social problems, such as drug abuse in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my streets back," said Dennis Garvey, 41, a VOICE member and Reseda 
resident. "I don't want these little hoodlums and beeper-carrying drug dealers 
running me off when I drive into a supermarket parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaking Out 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, an accountant with a Santa Monica aviation company, joined VOICE last 
year when the pastor at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in Reseda told 
him about the then-fledgling organization. Since then, Garvey has spoken in 
favor of gun control before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and has 
met with Robert Yates, the Los Angeles city parking administrator, to complain 
about abandoned vehicles on Valley streets. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Garvey became one of nine VOICE members to attend 10 days of 
leadership training organized by the Industrial Areas Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization of professional community organizers that helped set up VOICE. 
</P>
<P>
The training was "one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had in my 
life," said Garvey, who met community activists from Philadelphia, 
South-Central Los Angeles and the South Bronx of New York City at the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
A student leader at San Jose City College in the late 1960s, Garvey was perhaps 
more prepared than most for his role as a neighborhood activist. For others, 
learning the ropes of community organizing and public speaking has been more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Beginning 
</P>
<P>
Brother Peter Vasquez of Mary Immaculate Catholic Church in Pacoima also took 
the 10-day training course but said he is still reluctant about taking a 
leadership role. "I'm just beginning," he said. "I'm better at talking to 
people one-to-one. When it comes to a big crowd, I'm not the greatest. But I 
hope I will evolve into that." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, 50, said he joined VOICE because he was concerned about graffiti and 
the physical deterioration of the East Valley neighborhood that surrounds his 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Carmel Somers, a nun and full-time organizer for VOICE, said those who 
join the group are asked to become leaders. "Anyone who is active in the 
organization is called a leader," she said. "Making someone a leader is a form 
of recognition. When people begin to get recognition, they begin to act 
differently. They begin to feel they can change things." 
</P>
<P>
Somers said the group's philosophy is inspired by the late Saul Alinsky, a 
community organizer whose book "Rules for Radicals" envisioned a political 
movement in which each member would be given an equal role. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when VOICE addressed state Senate and Assembly committees this spring in 
support of a bill that would ban assault weapons, it was not only VOICE 
organizers who spoke. "People who are timid and shy and don't want to come to 
the microphone, we push them a little," Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Instrumental Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Montgomery, an aide to Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), said the 
testimony of VOICE members before the committees was instrumental in passage of 
the ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly an organization we listen to," she said. "We've worked with 
them on a number of issues, the most recent being the assault weapons bill. 
They were very effective on that." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said VOICE members have also worked in support of a school 
construction bill sponsored by Roos. 
</P>
<P>
Improved street maintenance and police response times are among the issues 
concerning VOICE member Javier Cabrera, 32, an insurance company 
representative. Cabrera said he has organized house meetings on the issues with 
his Canoga Park neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was inspired by the spirited formation meeting of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it was really uplifting," he said. "I didn't expect to see people from 
Encino, Woodland Hills and Tarzana all with the same concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said she and her VOICE members have been able to claim a few victories 
since that first meeting, including some badly needed street maintenance in her 
Canoga Park neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some good things," she said. "The potholes have been repaired. 
Not all of them, but a lot of them."

SAN DIEGAN KNOWS HOW TO MIX THINGS UP IN THE RECORDING STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times, John Archer lives a monkish existence, cloistered from sunlight for 
long stretches of time. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego musician, composer, producer and recording engineer has a 
dedication to music that's almost religious, hiding out in studios where he 
works the kind of audio magic that brought his band, Checkfield, a Grammy 
nomination this year for the album "Through the Lens." 
</P>
<P>
When Archer isn't working in his home studio, he's probably at a larger 
professional studio such as Network Music in Rancho Bernardo, where he spent 12 
hours on a recent Sunday working on Checkfield's next album with his bandmate 
Ron Satterfield. 
</P>
<P>
Two-inch recording tape rolled, stopped and rolled again through the heads of a 
24-track recorder. Archer sat behind a giant mixing board, adjusting dials, 
directing a violinist on the other side of the soundproof glass. 
</P>
<P>
Though his name is not well-recognized outside San Diego, Archer has become 
something of a player, in more ways than one, in the world of contemporary 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, when he and Satterfield recorded the first Checkfield album, 
they've built a national following for their richly textured studio sound, 
engineered by Archer. Mixing folk, rock, jazz and high-tech electronics, 
Checkfield has become popular enough that "Through the Lens" has sold 50,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
Archer also gets credit for discovering San Diego keyboard and synthesizer whiz 
Spencer Nilsen. He helped Nilsen get a recording contract with Checkfield's 
label, American Gramaphone, then produced and engineered Nilsen's debut album, 
"Architects of Change." 
</P>
<P>
And he has produced several albums for Network Music, a lucrative "music 
library" in Rancho Bernardo that records background tunes used in radio and 
television commercials and films. You can hear his work on commercials for 
several San Diego businesses, including automobile dealerships and car stereo 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Archer's ability to combine talented musicians and engineer a seamless, upbeat 
sound has impressed his Omaha, Neb.-based label, which recently signed him to 
produce five albums by other groups. 
</P>
<P>
"John's greatest talent is his ability to put the artist and the project in an 
ambiance that's creative," Nilsen said. "Being a talented engineer, producer 
and writer/arranger, he's able to see aspects of production a lot of engineers 
and producers can't see. He's a great buffer. He can kind of look ahead to the 
mixing and mastering process while you're recording and take a lot of steps 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Archer is a stickler for details. Several times during the Sunday studio 
session he asked violinist Darol Anger to redo a small section of music that to 
most other ears would have sounded fine. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a little stylized," he said after Anger played one part a little too 
much like Bulgarian folk music. 
</P>
<P>
"We need longer phrases," Satterfield told Anger during another break. 
</P>
<P>
"More legato," Archer explained, using musical terminology for smooth, 
drawn-out phrases, as opposed to the violinist's sharper approach. 
</P>
<P>
Archer said his years at Network, which he left recently to concentrate on 
Checkfield and producing and engineering for American Gramaphone, provided 
fantastic experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Those albums are literally the entire range of Western music, from rock to 
16th-Century minuets," Archer said. "They're the most wonderful training ground 
a producer could ever have." 
</P>
<P>
Some musicians come to their calling early in life, but Archer, 37, was in his 
late teens before he chose to pursue music. 
</P>
<P>
At Wayne State University in Detroit, Archer thought he would become an 
engineer -- the number-crunching kind. 
</P>
<P>
But he became bored with engineering classes and, in 1970, loaded his Ford 
Mustang with his few possessions and traveled the country for a few months 
before he ran out of money in San Diego. Something clicked, and he decided to 
be a musician. 
</P>
<P>
"I locked myself in a room for a couple of years and practiced," he said. "I 
started as a guitarist. In late 1971 or '72, I began playing local clubs. My 
first love has always been finger-style acoustic guitar -- Leo Kottke, John 
Renbourne, all of those characters. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was working the clubs, I was taking community college classes, and I'd 
switch back and forth between music and electronics." 
</P>
<P>
In the late '70s, the University of California at San Diego was in the 
forefront of computerized electronic music, and Archer remembers the state of 
technology in the classes he took. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd sit at a terminal and do punch cards, then take them to data processing. 
Three days later, at 2 in the morning, out of a little output port would come 
my 15-second composition." 
</P>
<P>
Archer and Satterfield met in a music class at Mesa College and soon began 
performing together. Satterfield's background as a serious jazz player provides 
a good counterpoint to Archer's folk, rock and synthesizer leanings. 
</P>
<P>
"The first incarnation of Checkfield was myself and Ron on acoustic guitars and 
singing, with a female vocalist. We were a cross between Manhattan Transfer, 
Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Peter, Paul and Mary. We left clubs, shifted to 
studio work and became an instrumental act right before we recorded 'Spirit,' 
our first national album, in 1982." 
</P>
<P>
Archer changed his last name from Slowiczek to Archer after that album, when 
disc jockeys had trouble with the Czechoslovakian name. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron came up with that on an exceedingly drunken night as a combination of the 
fact that I like old English Renaissance music and I'm a Sagittarius, an 
archer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The name Checkfield combines the last syllable of Archer's former last name 
with the "field" from Satterfield. 
</P>
<P>
Though at times Checkfield's music has been compared to the new age music 
recorded by pianist George Winston and others on the Windham Hill label, Archer 
doesn't like to label it new age, jazz or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole concept is one of writing the material and finding the right vehicle 
to express that material," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Archer's good fortune allows him a bit of the good life. He's an avid scuba 
diver and within the last year has been to the Grand Cayman Islands, Cabo San 
Lucas and the Great Barrier Reef off Australia. Also, being a boy from Detroit, 
he drives a late-model Corvette, "the ultimate dream." 
</P>
<P>
But those trappings aren't his fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I guess I'm so busy doing the work that I don't pay much 
attention (to the money). If there's anything that I would like about 
notoriety, it's that more people would hear the music."

STAGE REVIEW;

<P>
DURANG HAS LAST LAUGH IN 'BETTE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To laugh at something isn't to make light of it. Playwright Christopher Durang 
specializes in a kind of cancer-ward humor, where the thing most feared becomes 
the object of the most ferocious joke one can think of. 
</P>
<P>
Laughing at Sister Mary Ignatius and all her works -- to name Durang's most 
famous heroine -- is the first step to getting out of her grip. You need to be 
tough on her; she was tough on you. Once you have pulled free, however, it's 
possible to start admiring the old bat. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, Durang 
does for (or to) his family what he did for his favorite teacher. This is 
Durang's "Long Day's Journey Into Night," a laying of family ghosts. But it is 
played like a cartoon, so as to avoid O'Neill's mistake of buying into the 
family curse. 
</P>
<P>
A very healthy impulse and a painfully funny play. As in O'Neill's tragedy, we 
get the sense of a family as a nest of lonely people dedicated to making each 
other miserable. But here, for some reason, it's the stuff of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Not because the pain is downplayed. Peter Sagal's LATC program note suggests 
that this will be the approach. "No one in this play wants to hurt anyone 
else." Happily, director Dennis Erdman is having none of this. The 
eye-for-an-eye principle is seen as the very foundation of a Christian family 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Boo (Guy Boyd) insults Bette by getting drunk all the time. Bette (Christine 
Ebersole) counters by getting pregnant all the time. The baby is born dead, as 
was bound to happen, Bette and Boo being victims of the Rh factor -- and 
everybody is happy. 
</P>
<P>
Bette and Boo learned these tactics at home. Boo's dreadful father (Bryan 
Clark) has terrorized his tremulous mother (Lynn Milgrim) into being (his 
little joke) "the dumbest white woman alive." Bette's mother (Angela Paton) has 
scared her sister (Lela Ivey) into being the guiltiest Catholic girl ever. 
</P>
<P>
This is known as the family romance. The fact that it's a Catholic family adds 
a layer of things for the characters to be nervous about, including a rather 
forlorn priest named Father Donnally (Stephen Tobolowsky), no match for Sister 
Mary Ignatius. But Durang doesn't make as big deal of the church as one might 
expect. Father Donnally doesn't press Bette to have all those babies. Bette is 
positive that she was meant to have them, and she intends to keep on doing so 
until she gets a good one. The indoctrination comes from Hollywood as much as 
from Rome, but the real problem is Bette, whom Ebersole shows us will not take 
"No" or even "Maybe" for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem, Durang seems to be saying, is human nature. Put these people 
in any culture, and they'd be on each other's case. Durang's narrator, and 
clearly his surrogate, is Bette and Boo's son, Matt -- the one blue bundle that 
lived. He's trying to understand why people keep setting such exquisite traps 
for themselves, and by the end of the play it's still a mystery to him. A 
mystery that he'll probably play a role in, down the road. 
</P>
<P>
Actor David Marshall Grant ends the play on a note of acceptance -- not a 
whimper; not a smile. His Matt progresses through adolescent shell-shock to the 
point of being able to feel a bit of sympathy for the hell his parents went 
through, and we sense a real, if small, gain. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, however, Grant makes Matt so diffident that we don't pick up on Matt's 
dread that his family's problems are somehow both his fault and his 
responsibility. Durang was to have played the role at LATC originally (he had 
to drop out for a screenwriting assignment). The character might have been 
clearer with the author at his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
No one else in the play changes a fraction -- it's part of Durang's point that 
families don't change, unless it's to get even more impossible. Director 
Erdman's cast makes strong choices about who their characters are and what they 
want, and the only drawback is that the character sometimes misses the layer of 
self-deception that makes certain domestic monsters so fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Paton as Bette's mother, for instance, would be funnier if she hid her 
wolfishness a bit -- if in some sense, she really did wish the best for her 
children, at least in her own mind. Bryan Clark's big smile as he destroys his 
wife (Milgrim's wonderful) is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersole is all presence as Bette, Boyd all absence as Boo, and that's the 
right combination. Tobolowsky's Father Donnally may be too soulful, forgetting 
that "Bette and Boo" can't afford to get too real about all this stuff, or we 
get into O'Neill territory, where it can't compete. Better to go for the fun in 
the role, and let the darkness take care of itself.

KPBS MEMBERS DON'T SURF, BUT THEY DO LIKE TO GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KPBS members don't surf. They prefer gardening, and, when they read, they pick 
up "Sunset" more than "Playboy" and "The New Yorker." 
</P>
<P>
They're rich and old, too, but they don't own airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
These are the conclusions of a KPBS survey, so it's not like they are facts. 
But staffers in all KPBS departments are poring over pages of information about 
the quirks and life styles of dues-paying members of the local public 
broadcasting organization (both radio and television). The 57-question 
demographic survey was sent to 1,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 of the questionnaires were returned, a seemingly small number of 
KPBS' 60,000 members, but enough, the demographic researchers say, to get an 
accurate sampling. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Good, the editor of KPBS' "On Air" magazine, was pleased by response to 
the four-page questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised people spent as much time as was required to fill out the 
survey," Good said. 
</P>
<P>
He helped develop the questionnaire, and the results will primarily be used to 
help sell advertising space in "On Air," KPBS' monthly magazine. Good wrote in 
this month's edition (which is mailed to all KPBS members), that he always 
envisioned the "On Air" reader as a "sort of idealized version of myself -- 
curious about all the things I am curious about, but perhaps somewhat better 
looking and more punctual." 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Good was wrong in a big way. Typical KPBS members are nothing 
like him. For one, they're a lot older. The median age of female KPBS members 
is 61.8 years; the males are slightly younger at 58.1. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS members are also far richer than Good. According to the survey, 10% of 
KPBS households are worth more than $1 million. Although 7% of the members have 
annual incomes of less than $20,000, 6% make more than $200,000 a year; the 
median annual income is $55,556. They're well educated, too. Eighty-five 
percent are college-educated, and 21.5% hold either a master's degree or a 
doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
Their favorite KPBS programs, in order, are "McNeil/Lehrer," "Masterpiece 
Theater," "Mystery!" "Nova" and "Nature." 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to stop at this type of sketchy information, the survey, conducted by 
CIC Research at a cost of about $4,000, attempted to delve into the souls and 
psyches of KPBS members, to find out what makes them tick. 
</P>
<P>
They're not a real exciting bunch of folks. A whopping 65% listed gardening as 
a favorite leisure-time activity; 33% checked needlework. In the space provided 
for "other" responses, only one person filled in surfing, the same number 
listed "beading," and four listed model railroading. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two percent subscribe to "Sunset" magazine. Only two respondents listed 
"Playboy," and four said they subscribe to "Organic Gardening." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the responses were inexplicable, if not downright strange. Twenty-two 
percent said they visited or planned to visit Hawaii, for non-business reasons, 
which doesn't seem unusual. Except almost as many, 19%, had vacationed in 
Phoenix, of all places. 
</P>
<P>
"Think that one over," Good said. 
</P>
<P>
The vague questions probably had a lot to do with some of the strange 
responses. Asked to list the forms of transportation used on recent vacations, 
one person wrote "canoe." A surprising 1.6% said they didn't live in a 
single-family home, condo, apartment or mobile home. One person said he lived 
in "Dominimus Pud," which sent Good scurrying to the dictionary. He is still 
unclear what the person meant. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the survey, the type done by most publications, is meant to be a 
sketch, not a blueprint of KPBS members. At least now KPBS management knows 
that only 9% of its members surveyed scuba dive. 
</P>
<P>
Once he got over the shock of being fired last Thursday, KKLQ (Q106) morning 
guy Jack Murphy became philosophical, considering the seven months remaining on 
his contract. "I'm just going to sit at home until March and collect my $15,000 
a month," he said. A personality conflict with program director Garry Wall 
appears to be the primary factor in Murphy's sudden departure. "I wouldn't call 
it a personality conflict because he doesn't have one," Murphy said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Despite an avalanche of hype, tickets sales for the Aug. 22 Who concert are 
still hovering around the 30,000 mark, according to XTRA-FM (91X), sponsor of 
the concert. The station says its break-even point is 50,000 tickets. "We 
expect sales to start picking up now," said program director Kevin Stapleford, 
adding that he had been wary about a Rolling Stones' announcement of tour 
dates. "Now we're feeling pretty good about it." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Although 91X has been touting its exclusive rights to the concert, even sending 
out a threatening letter to other stations, it can't stop KGB from saying, "KGB 
welcomes The Who to San Diego." . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was the type of innocent slip of the tongue that makes television news a 
hilarious business. Reporting on Tuesday night's Assembly election, KGTV 
(Channel 10) reporter Jim Wilkerson, live, in the heat of the moment, 
introduced an interview by saying a candidate would share his views of the 
"erection." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Local underwater photographer Chuck Nicklin, a founder of the local Diving 
Locker chain, spent three months working on the massive, notoriously over 
budget "The Abyss." He saw it for the first time last Tuesday night. "There was 
one scene where they go into the submarine that we worked on for a week, and it 
just goes by in a flash," he said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KSON General Manager Clarke Brown is moving up the corporate ladder. He has 
been promoted to senior vice president of radio for Jefferson Pilot 
Communications, owners of KSON and eight other stations. He'll move to Atlanta, 
where he'll assume control of WQXI-AM and FM. Mike Stafford, will move up from 
general sales manager to replace Brown at KSON. The changes take effect Sept. 
1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five journalists played hooky to attend a late-morning screening of 
"sex, lies and videotape" last week. Usually, five is a crowd for screenings. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater press release made it clear there was 
something very wrong with the previous press release about the upcoming lunar 
eclipse. "PLEASE DESTROY RELEASE BY SAME NAME THAT WAS MAILED YESTERDAY -- IT 
CONTAINS ERRORS," the headline read, highlighted in yellow. In fact, the error 
was relatively serious. The earlier release had the wrong date for Wednesday's 
eclipse. "Our astronomer forgot to convert the time to Pacific time," a theater 
spokeswoman said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After six years earning a slew of awards as a senior producer for KPBS-TV, 
Matthew Eisen resigned recently to pursue free-lance projects. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego Chronicles," the KNSD-TV (Channel 39) show that debuted in June with 
an hour-long program on entrepreneurs, is on hold. "It's still alive," said 
executive producer Doug Dougherty. "We're just trying to figure out how to make 
it a quality program and bring it in under budget."

Imprisoned soul singer James Brown has lost the 20 days off he had earned for 
good behavior after officials found $40,600 in cash and checks in his Columbia, 
S.C., jail cell, authorities said. Inmates are allowed no more than $50 in the 
prison. Corrections officials took $600 of the cash for the Inmate Welfare Fund 
and the Internal Revenue Service has already spoken for the rest, saying it 
will be applied to an $11-million lien against Brown. The soul singer is 
serving a six-year term for assault and leading lawmen on a high-speed chase.

About 700 Rolling Stones fans who had paid $3 each got to hear the legendary 
band jam for an hour Saturday night when the group launched its 1989 tour with 
an unpublicized appearance at a small New Haven, Conn., club. The band opened 
the 11-song set at Toad's Place with "Start Me Up" and played several songs 
from their new album, "Steel Wheels," which is to be released Aug. 29. The show 
also featured several Stones' classics, including, "Jumpin' Jack Flash," "Honky 
Tonk Woman," "Brown Sugar," and "It's Only Rock 'n' Roll." Word that the Stones 
were going to play at Toad's had leaked out over the last several days, and 
hundreds of fans were turned away before the Stones took the stage at 10:45 
p.m. The Stones have traditionally opened new tours with impromptu shows at 
small venues. The tour resumes in Philadelphia on Aug. 31.

Britain's weekly tabloid, the News of the World, published an apology to Clint 
Eastwood on Sunday and said it had agreed to pay a large sum in libel damages 
for articles published July 9 under the headline "Go On Clint, Make My Day." 
The amount of damages was not disclosed, but Eastwood, famous for his film 
roles as a laconic Western "tough guy," told reporters he would donate the 
money to charity.

The China Film Assn. did not name a best picture this year, according to the 
China's official Xinhua News Agency, which has quoted film experts as saying "a 
lack of outstanding films" made awarding the Golden Rooster impossible. This 
was the first time since the award was established in 1981 that no film was 
named best picture. Awarding of the Golden Rooster has created controversy in 
recent years as China's film industry becomes increasingly bold and creative, 
but since the military crushed the student-led pro-democracy movement in June, 
the government has cracked down on dissent and criticized some reforms as 
having gone too far.

VIOLINIST GIL SHAHAM IN UNSCHEDULED LOCAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Serving as a pinch-hitter, 18-year-old violinist Gil Shaham made his West Coast 
debut Saturday at Pepperdine University in the final program of this summer's 
Strawberry Creek Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Shaham has performed on short notice before, most notably substituting for an 
ailing Itzhak Perlman in London earlier this year. This time the Dorothy DeLay 
student replaced Mark Peskanov, who is reportedly due for finger surgery. 
Stepping out for his initial bow, Shaham seemed ill-at-ease, but once he began 
playing, he exhibited remarkable confidence and poise, and delivered a 
stunningly clean account of the Mendelssohn Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
He produced a pure, radiant sound, suave in softer passages, bold and soaring 
in the louder ones. He may need a few years to develop his own interpretive 
style -- the cadenza, for instance, was accurate but sterile-sounding -- but he 
nonetheless infused his playing with considerable drama. 
</P>
<P>
Four curtain calls elicited an encore, Svendsen's Romance, Opus 26, to which 
the young virtuoso brought artful phrasing and sure-footed control. Providing 
solid support were the members of the Festival Orchestra, conducted by Yehuda 
Gilad, although occasionally one heard wayward intonation from the winds. 
</P>
<P>
In two orchestral pieces, Gilad showed a capacity for coaxing energized, 
propulsive music-making from his ensemble. He made a strong case for Dvorak's 
Sixth Symphony, bringing out telling details and defining key points, all the 
while maintaining an uninterrupted musical flow. Fast passages did find string 
players scrambling noticeably on occasion, but on the whole Gilad succeeded in 
keeping this a balanced, rhythmically tight reading. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra opened the program with a liquid, transparent account of the 
"Sigfried Idyll," weaving continuous lyrical threads into Wagner's contrapuntal 
tapestry.TERRY McQUILKIN

FINAL INSTITUTE CHAMBER MUSIC CONCERT AT SCHOENBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute closed its series of free chamber music 
concerts Friday. Vigorous performances of varied repertory and a star turn by 
Institute director and cellist Lynn Harrell cheered a large audience at 
Schoenberg Hall, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The program began with the nervous acerbities of Lutoslawksi's String Quartet, 
as coached by the composer, who had been in residence at the Institute. 
Violinists Ashley Horne and Carolyn Huebl, violist Kirsten Monke and cellist 
Trina Carey set forth both its attenuated insinuations and its jack-hammer 
violence with purpose and elan. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Frank, scheduled to take the piano part in Beethoven's Triple Concerto 
with the Institute Orchestra at Hollywood Bowl Sunday, was featured in 
Schumann's Quintet in E-flat, with violinists Josefina Vergara and Susan 
Hytken, violist Caroline Coade and cellist Jonas Krejci. 
</P>
<P>
Frank offered blocky, brassy, intermittently inaccurate extroversion in the 
first movement, and then turned abruptly into an eminently supportive 
team-player. The strings played well as a unit, balancing the work nicely in 
sound and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Frank also backed Harrell in a prefatory Schumann indulgence: a suitably 
yearning account of "Traumerei" in transcription. 
</P>
<P>
The Suite for Brass Quintet by Vern Reynolds traces an overlong neo-Classic 
course, clearly delineated and deftly scored. It received a bright, technically 
resourceful and thoroughly musical performance from Timothy Divers and Chad 
Foster, trumpets; Barbara Adamcik, horn; Jonathan Willis, trombone, and Douglas 
Tornquist, tuba.JOHN HENKEN

MUSIC FALTERS AT LONG BEACH FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a pleasure it was Saturday afternoon and evening at the second annual Long 
Beach Jazz Festival. With a cool breeze blowing across the harbor, the sound 
properly balanced for jazz, and brisk, no-delay stage work, the setting left 
little to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
The music, however, was not quite so flawless. After typically energetic 
opening sets by Kevin Eubanks, Ernie Andrews &amp; the Capp-Pierce Juggernaut 
and Fattburger, vibist Roy Ayers finally brought the crowd to its feet with a 
non-stop tour through his uniquely entertaining approach to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers is one of perhaps four or five vibes players in the world who can almost 
instantly be recognized on the basis of style alone. The brisk, dancing lines 
of his improvisations were brilliant examples of contemporary improvisation. 
But Ayers clearly enjoyed contrasting his pure jazz with several long funk 
tunes -- "Poo-Poo La-La Means I Love You" was one -- that he sang and performed 
with theatrical fervor (he climbed on top of his vibes to make one story 
point). The high-energy flashpoint came during a mock argument between Ayers 
and percussionist/vibist Dwight Gassoway that turned into a whirlwind duel 
across the bars of the vibes. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers' long set traced in part to the typically late arrival of Freddie 
Hubbard. The trumpeter's fabled undependability didn't sit well with at least 
one member of the audience. When Hubbard tried to explain away his lateness by 
announcing that he'd just gotten off a plane from Japan, a voice rang out of 
the darkness shouting, "Yeah, man, and the check's in the mail!" 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the real circumstances, the music which followed was disjointed and 
unsteady. Hubbard, of course, can rip off a powerful solo almost any time he 
wants to, and there were indeed moments of sheer brilliance. But they were only 
moments, with the bulk of his efforts coming across with the fatigue of 
recycled glory. The real Hubbard essence must have been left behind on the 
plane from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Diane Schuur worked more effectively with her own piano accompaniment 
than she has in recent outings as a stand-up singer. The addition of 
keyboardist Rob Mullins -- who provided an enormous array of synthesized sounds 
and crackerjack solos -- also helped balance Schuur's frequently monochromatic 
style. 
</P>
<P>
Sticking mostly to standards like "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "Teach 
Me Tonight," along with an occasional blues, she flashed occasional moments of 
excellence. But Schuur continued to mistake shrillness for energy and shouting 
for intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, closing the evening, brought things back 
into equilibrium with just the right mix. Winging comfortably through such 
pop-based pieces as Marvin Gaye's "Don't Mess With Mr. T.," he contrasted 
strong, blues-based improvising with easily accessible funk rhythms. It was, 
finally, the perfect ending for a beautifully staged, but musically unsteady 
festival performance. 
</P>
<P>
The festival was scheduled to continue through Sunday with performances by 
Alphonse Mouzon, Chick Corea, Dianne Reeves and others. DON HECKMAN

FLANAGAN, THE MUSICIANS' MUSICIAN, DRAWS A FULL HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playing for a full house liberally sprinkled with admiring fellow pianists, 
Tommy Flanagan opened Friday (and closed Sunday) at the Loa. 
</P>
<P>
At 59, Flanagan has reached a level of acceptance as the musicians' musician. 
His professorial mien belies his often bop-directed style, understated yet 
always authoritative. 
</P>
<P>
He leans toward lesser-known songs mainly by the be-bop pioneers: J. J. 
Johnson, whose "Lament" was a high point; Tadd Dameron, represented by "Our 
Delight," and Tom McIntosh, whose "With Malice Toward None" gave Flanagan a 
chance to display his harmonic ideas as well as subtle dynamic shadings. 
</P>
<P>
Sudden bursts of upsweeping chords sometimes lent an element of surprise, with 
a nimble left hand offering graceful filigree fills. 
</P>
<P>
He is technically flawless but never humorless, as witness the sly quotes from 
"Salt Peanuts" in his version of an old Gillespie piece, the quasi-Cuban "Tin 
Tin Deo." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's manner on-stage is reserved; his announcements are often barely 
audible, though he was heard paying tribute to Benny Carter, whose "When Lights 
Are Low" was the opening song. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's bassist, George Mraz, is as remarkable a partner as he could hope 
for. Educated at the University of Prague, he has developed an astonishing 
command that turns every solo into a model of creative artistry. During one 
tune Flanagan suddenly began playing at twice the tempo, so that for Mraz it 
became a double-Czech stomp. 
</P>
<P>
Mraz and the young drummer Kenny Washington function as a formidable team, 
working with Flanagan to present neatly crafted arrangements. In terms of the 
warmth and unity established by the three, it was, to quote a Thad Jones song 
played during this luminous hour, like old times.

LELAND CRASH SITE FOUND; ALL 16 KILLED; 
</P>
<P>
WRECKAGE OF PLANE WITH CONGRESSMAN SPOTTED IN ETHIOPIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. military helicopters on Sunday located the wreckage of a plane that 
crashed last Monday with Texas congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard. 
Witnesses who visited the site said there were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. rescue and recovery teams said that the plane hit a mountain about 4,300 
feet above sea level, having missed clearing the peak by about 300 feet. The 
crash site is about 75 miles east of the Fugnido refugee camp that Leland was 
flying to visit when the plane vanished in heavy weather last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"If they would have flown over that peak they would have been home free," said 
Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), a colleague of Leland's who has accompanied 
search crews for the last two days and was aboard the helicopter that first 
spotted the wreckage Sunday. Ackerman said that the plane appeared to have hit 
"nose first, right into the rocks; its two wings sheared off, its engines 
melted, its fuselage gone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wreckage Examined 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman said that military paratroopers lowered themselves from his helicopter 
on ropes to examine the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us everyone had died instantaneously," Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Leland, a Democrat, was making his sixth tour of refugee camps 
along the Ethiopia-Sudan border as chairman of the House Select Committee on 
Hunger, a panel he had helped to establish five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Also aboard the plane were Hugh Anderson Johnson Jr. and Patrice Yvonne 
Johnson, both aides to Leland (who were not related); Joyce Francine Williams, 
an aide to Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), and an expert on child 
nutrition; Y. Ivan Tillen, a New York businessman and friend of Leland's; 
Robert Woods, a political and economic officer at the American Embassy in Addis 
Ababa; Gladys Gilbert, a special projects officer for the mission of the U.S. 
Agency for International Development attached to the embassy; Thomas Worrick, 
the acting AID representative in Ethiopia, and Worrick's wife, Roberta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 Ethiopians Killed 
</P>
<P>
Also on board were Debebe Agonofer, an Ethiopian agricultural economist with 
the AID mission, and six other Ethiopians, including the plane's crew of three. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the news in the United States was one of sadness coupled with an 
outpouring of praise for Leland's work. A statement issued by President Bush 
said that "Mickey Leland and the other members of his traveling party, both 
Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause -- trying to feed the 
hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Dellums spoke of his staff aide who lost her life in the crash as "a close 
personal friend for over a decade" and said that everyone on the plane "shared 
a common commitment to helping the poor, the starving and the dispossessed in 
that war-torn, drought-stricken land." 
</P>
<P>
"Their deaths are a collective loss to all humanity," Dellums said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the crash site ended what had been one of the most extensive 
American search and rescue operations ever conducted in a Third World country. 
By Sunday, 18 aircraft, including four American helicopters, two American C-130 
airplanes and 12 Ethiopian aircraft, were involved in the search. Three more 
American helicopters were reported to be en route from Eglin Air Force Base in 
Florida when word of the discovery came. 
</P>
<P>
The search on Sunday was hampered again by thunderstorms, poor visibility and 
other conditions that characterized many of the previous days of search. 
</P>
<P>
"The terrain was fairly rugged and the weather conditions were bad getting 
there," said Capt. Clair M. Gilk, commander of one of the two helicopters that 
were the first to spot the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Gilk said that the crash site, in a mountainous and heavily wooded region, is 
so remote and inaccessible that the nearest landing site for helicopters is 
half a mile away, a distance that he said could take as much as three hours to 
cover on foot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recovery Planned for Today 
</P>
<P>
Air Force personnel were assigned to remain near the site Sunday night to keep 
it secure. Recovery of the remains of those aboard the plane, a twin-engine 
Twin Otter, was to commence at first light today. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the site's inaccessibility, it could take at least two days to 
recover all of the bodies, according to Maj. Gen. James F. Record, who came 
here from Washington to oversee the search effort. Record arrived in Addis 
Ababa about 10 minutes after the first reports were received of the sighting of 
the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer, said that the 
remains of the Americans will probably be returned to the United States through 
Torrejon Air Base near Madrid, where the American armed forces maintains full 
mortuary facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dellums to Accompany Bodies 
</P>
<P>
Dellums, House Majority Whip William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) and Republican Reps. 
Bill Emerson of Missouri and Jack Fields of Texas plan to fly to Addis Ababa to 
accompany the bodies back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the crash site came at about 1:15 p.m. local time Sunday. Ackerman 
said that the helicopter he was traveling in set down during the morning at an 
airstrip near the village of Dembi Dolo. There, the crew came upon a Roman 
Catholic missionary who told them that he had heard reports from local 
villagers that a plane had been heard nearby last week. Presently, the crew 
found an Ethiopian surveyor who said he could guide them to an area near where 
the plane had been heard. The surveyor was taken aboard, crew members said, but 
on their way toward their destination they spotted the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
The location was described as very steep, with the plane resting on land that 
was pitched at an angle of about 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mostly Rocks and Brush' 
</P>
<P>
Crew members described the site as "mostly rocks and brush" and indicated that 
the pilot of Leland's plane may have been trying to escape bad weather on 
Monday by following the pathway of a river flowing through a valley. Before the 
plane reached safety, it ran into the mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Alan Wheat (D-Mo.), who with Ackerman had been flying with search crews 
for the last two days, said he telephoned House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.) from Addis Ababa soon after the discovery was made. He said that 
Foley was "heartbroken" at the news. 
</P>
<P>
The crash site was described by U.S. authorities as being about 20 nautical 
miles due east of the town of Gambela and 230 nautical miles west-southwest of 
Addis Ababa. It appeared to be near the village of Bure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area Had Been Covered 
</P>
<P>
The area of the site had apparently been searched within the first two days 
after the crash by American aircraft using electronic devices in an attempt to 
detect an emergency signal from the downed craft. However, Sunday was the first 
day that helicopters flew over the area to make visual inspections. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery, and indications that the passengers had died instantly, brought 
an end to charges that the American military response to the emergency was 
inadequate and tardy. Wheat, who was among those who had pressed Defense 
Department officials for the deployment of more aircraft in the search, said 
after the discovery Sunday: "We could have brought every plane in the world 
that we have, and it would not have made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in his Sunday statement, said: "I have known, admired and 
worked with Mickey Leland for many years. His sense of compassion and desire to 
help those in need has aided millions of people from Houston to Addis Ababa. 
Our hearts go out to (his widow) and to the families and friends of the 
congressional staff members, State Department, Agency for International 
Development and Ethiopian officials who joined Mickey on his important mission 
and who died with him trying to carry it out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best in Compassion' 
</P>
<P>
Foley said that "in his search to look into the plight of the world's most 
desperate and hungry individuals, Rep. Leland represented the best in 
compassion that we as a nation possess." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III praised the congressman as "an 
outstanding statesman and humanitarian who died serving his country." Baker 
also thanked Ethiopia, a Soviet-allied country with which Washington has had 
strained relations for several years, for its "outstanding support" in the 
search for Leland's party. 
</P>
<P>
Bush offered U.S. help to the Ethiopian government for its investigation into 
the crash of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Leland was a former Houston pharmacist who called the fight against hunger "my 
passion." He leaves a wife, Alison Walton Leland, and a 3-year-old son, 
Jarrett. Mrs. Leland is pregnant with the couple's second child. 
</P>
<P>
First elected to Congress in 1978, he represented a mostly black and Hispanic 
section of Houston after the retirement of Rep. Barbara Jordan, a fellow 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Leland had no significant opposition for his congressional seat since he was 
first elected, winning his most recent election with 96% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Melissa Healy, in Washington, contributed to this story.

BIG GAIN FOR SLUM TRADERS IN COLISEUM DEAL REVEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND and PENELOPE McMILLAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Los Angeles city attorney was secretly investigating slum traders 
last year, another public agency, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, 
paid some of the same traders $1.6 million for a dilapidated, fire-damaged 
apartment house, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for the May, 1988, purchase was expansion of parking facilities 
near the Coliseum, but officials say they primarily wanted to get rid of gang 
members who inhabited the building. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum Commission, anxious to raze the building at 3981 S. Menlo Ave., 
did not order a written appraisal and may have paid more than market value for 
the property, The Times found. At the end of 1985, when the property was 
legally habitable, it sold for about $1.1 million -- about a third less than 
the $1.6-million sale price. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe the price when I heard it, I was so flabbergasted," said 
insurance broker Benton O. Shannon, who handled insurance for the building 
until the former owner, fugitive slumlord V. J. Sharma, stopped paying his 
bills. "It just wasn't worth that. I heard about it from (one of Sharma's 
associates) and he just smiled. It was one of those sly, shake-your-head 
smiles." 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum officials said that they have no regrets about purchasing the 
building, which has been torn down and converted into a parking lot. "If we'd 
paid $3 million for it, we would have thought it was a bargain," Joel Ralph, 
general manager of the Coliseum and Sports Arena, said last week in an 
interview. "We had parking lots no one would park on because they were scared 
to death to walk by that building." 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the principals involved in the building over the previous three 
years -- including the real estate firm that got a $97,500 commission from the 
sellers in the deal -- are now defendants in a civil racketeering suit filed 
March 28 by the city attorney, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, and 
Litt &amp; Stormer, a private firm representing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson to be learned from the deal, according to Kim Savage, an attorney 
with the Legal Aid Foundation, is that the slumlords "won." 
</P>
<P>
"They run it (a building) down until someone is willing to just knock it down," 
Savage said. "They win. They get what they are interested in, which is profit 
from real estate. Then there is the most obvious loss: the loss of affordable 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alleges Conspiracy 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that 142 financiers, investors and companies conspired to 
drain 11 sample slum buildings of thousands of dollars in cash rents through 
sham sales and inflated loans while leaving the buildings to fall into 
disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
The 3981 S. Menlo Ave. building was to have been the 12th example in the 
lawsuit, and will still be used as evidence at trial, according to Deputy City 
Atty. Stephanie Sautner, who heads the city's slum task force. 
</P>
<P>
"This building fits the pattern of all the others with respect to the same 
players, the same rapid transfers, the same slum housing violations and the 
same lenders and brokers involved," she said. "Many of the sham transfers are 
aimed at falsely inflating the value of the property." 
</P>
<P>
Sautner said she could not comment on whether the $1.6-million sales price was 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The story of 3981 S. Menlo Ave. shows how closely the management of a building 
can be tied to crime in a neighborhood, and how costly a building's decline can 
be in both human and financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housed Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
The building, called the El Portal Apartments, was erected in 1926 across the 
street from what is now the Los Angeles Swimming Stadium in Exposition Park. In 
recent years, the building housed immigrant families and other low-income 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1985, the building was purchased by Los Angeles real estate agent 
William Leyton's Interreal Pacific Properties for about $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Recorded documents and interviews indicate the paper value of the property rose 
steadily as its physical condition deteriorated. They also show how critical a 
role lenders played in establishing that paper value. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 30, 1985, records show, Interreal Pacific Properties got virtually 100% 
financing on his purchase from A &amp; B Loan Co. of Inglewood, which issued 
three separate loans for about $1.1 million on the property -- loans that would 
ultimately be paid off in the Coliseum sale. 
</P>
<P>
"They got this highly questionable loan," said Harold Gibbons, one of the 
sellers. "And the place was just like a jungle within a matter of weeks after 
we sold it. It just turned my stomach even to drive by it." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, lenders require 20% down, and often much more for apartment 
buildings or old structures. Therefore, anyone looking at the recorded loans 
against the property would think it was worth considerably more than its actual 
market value. That impression would be enhanced by the fact that the loans were 
transferred -- one seven times in 24 months -- to different loan companies 
apparently eager to buy them. And new loans would be added. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sautner alleged, such deals are not "arm's length transactions." Many 
of the transactions on this and the other slum buildings listed in the city's 
lawsuit were among close associates. 
</P>
<P>
Leyton, according to his resume, appraised "major loan applicants" for A &amp; 
B. And most of the loan companies that bought the notes on the properties have 
corporate ties to A &amp; B, most sharing the same address. Attorneys 
representing Alexander Spitzer, owner of A &amp; B, declined to discuss the 
company's loan transactions. 
</P>
<P>
A holding company for A &amp; B recently filed for reorganization under Chapter 
11 bankruptcy proceedings, listing more than $130 million in debts. 
</P>
<P>
On his resume, Leyton lists the building as a "restoration" project "completed" 
in 1986. However, records show the building not up to code during his 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Leyton deeded the property four months after its purchase to V. J. Sharma, an 
occasional business associate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharma Convicted 
</P>
<P>
By November, 1987, Sharma was convicted of 112 criminal slum violations on five 
of his buildings -- the largest criminal conviction of a slumlord ever in Los 
Angeles. That same month, he was also cited by the Los Angeles Fire Department 
for 48 "life-threatening" code violations at the Menlo building. Dozens of 
plumbing, electrical and building code violations also accumulated. One city 
inspector called it the worst building he had ever entered. 
</P>
<P>
During Sharma's ownership, some tenants moved out as gang members moved in, 
squatting in empty units. The Coliseum Commission began placing an armed guard 
outside the building on event nights after a spectator was murdered in 1986 
behind the building. 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn on Dec. 1, 1987, an arson fire broke out in an empty unit in the 
Menlo building. Five units were destroyed and several others damaged. No one 
was injured, but officials estimated the damage at about $230,000 and ordered 
the building evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our opportunity," said Margaret Farnum, commission secretary and 
acting chief administrative officer. But, she said, the commission was unaware 
that the building was a target of the city's slum task force -- even though 
City Atty. James K. Hahn held a press conference outside it the day after the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ullman, general manager of Five Star Parking, which operates the 
Coliseum's parking lots, negotiated the deal. "The parking was secondary 
compared to (getting rid of) the problems the gang created," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ullman said he had difficulty even contacting the owners. Sharma, sentenced to 
20 months in jail, had fled the country. Leyton, the former owner, emerged as 
the real estate agent representing the new owner, an Encino-based company 
called Ty Properties that is also a defendant in the city's civil racketeering 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
Leyton's attorney said in an interview that his client's involvement in this 
deal was strictly that of a real estate agent contacted by the Coliseum 
officials. He declined to allow Leyton -- a defendant in the city attorney's 
suit -- to be interviewed directly. 
</P>
<P>
Once a price of about $1.6 million was negotiated, Paul Conn, a partner in the 
Charles Dunn Co. who specializes in low-income real estate, was asked to advise 
the commission on whether to go ahead with the sale. He provided his services 
without charge. 
</P>
<P>
Conn said he did no written appraisal, and was not aware of the extent of fire 
damage or of the code violations outstanding on the vacant building. 
</P>
<P>
He said he assessed the building on the basis of a per-unit value to a 
potential investor who could operate it as an apartment building. "I said, 
'That's a good value, jump on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Written Appraisal 
</P>
<P>
Since there was no written appraisal outlining the condition of the building, 
it is debatable whether the price was appropriate. Records show that three 
other lots, one already a parking lot, sold for $300,000 a block away, but 
outside the area identified for public use in Exposition Park's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons, the co-owner of the apartment building until December, 1985, said he 
was amazed to learn what the property later sold for after it had deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have expected the property to be worth maybe $1.5 million by then . . 
. in decent shape, with paying tenants in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The final sales price of $1,625,000 was financed primarily by parking fees. The 
property went into escrow on March 24, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's negotiator, Ullman, said he told Leyton that the Coliseum 
wanted all encumbrances on the property removed. "The only thing the Coliseum 
was interested in," Ullman said, "was that they deliver clear title without 
liens or anything against the property. How they cleaned everything up, they 
did all that through escrow." 
</P>
<P>
It was cleaned up through an unusual foreclosure auction in the middle of the 
escrow, according to records. The effect of the sale was to transfer the 
property from one corporate name to another in the same office while wiping out 
nearly $100,000 in liens to more than a dozen creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The sale transferred ownership of the property from Ty Properties to Canadian 
Pacific Inc., both of which occupy the same Encino office. According to the 
city attorney's office, the companies are run by the same people, including 
Mordehai Ben-Horin and Dan Tepper, both defendants in the city lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Price 
</P>
<P>
Records suggest that the proposed purchase price was about $100,000 less than 
the $1,625,000 the Coliseum had agreed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the foreclosure sale, according to the preliminary title report, 
there were 31 liens, mortgages and court judgments against the property, 
including many debts incurred by Sharma. 
</P>
<P>
Several lien-holders contacted by The Times, ranging from a fire sprinkler 
company to the city of Inglewood, lost their money. "I finally wrote it off on 
my taxes," said Kami Boudai, president of California Technology Systems Inc., a 
sprinkler company to which Sharma owed $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No State Record 
</P>
<P>
The new owner, Canadian Pacific, agreed to Ty Properties' original terms of 
sale to the Coliseum and the deal closed May 11, 1988. The deed was signed over 
to the Coliseum by a "vice president" and a corporate "secretary" who Sautner 
said were, in fact, clerical workers in the office of Tepper and Ben-Horin. 
</P>
<P>
"The way this transfer took place and the manner in which they've placed minor 
clerical workers as officers of the corporation is similar to all the . . . 
transfers" in the slumlords lawsuit, Sautner said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the building was sold, the same two clerical workers signed 
notes for more than $500,000 using the Menlo building as collateral. The notes 
were made out to "N. V. Boehmite, a California corporation." The secretary of 
state's office says it has no record of such a company. 
</P>
<P>
Tepper did not return a reporter's phone calls. Ben-Horin declined comment on 
his financial transactions on the Menlo building. "This is business and it's 
none of your business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the sales price was fair, Ben-Horin said: "It doesn't matter to 
me if somebody overpaid. . . . I didn't force anybody to pay." 
</P>
<P>
The property was the first ever purchased by the Coliseum. Commission secretary 
Margaret Farnum said the commission has new procedures requiring written 
appraisals before to property acquisitions. "Our first time around, you could 
maybe say we were a little naive," she said. "You could consider us novices who 
took most things at face value."

SYRIAN FORCES LAUNCH GROUND ATTACK IN BEIRUT 
</P>

<P>
Syrian-led ground forces assaulted a strategic, Christian-held ridgeline above 
Beirut on Sunday, escalating the bloody conflict that staggered the Lebanese 
capital with a fourth straight day of relentless shelling. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on the mountaintop town of Souq el Gharb began at 10 a.m. and was 
led by a Syrian army infantry brigade, supported by Druze and pro-Syrian 
Palestinian troops, according to reports from Beirut. It was the first major 
ground assault of the five-month battle for Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Christian fighters claimed late Sunday to have beaten back the 
offensive, although police confirmed only that heavy fighting was taking place 
on the ridgeline overlooking the smoke-shrouded capital. Both sides had earlier 
claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Christian-dominated Lebanese army said the U.S.-trained 8th 
Brigade "repulsed the assault, counterattacked and put the enemy force into 
chaotic flight." However, an official of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt's 
Progressive Socialist Party militia claimed that the largely abandoned town, 
once home to 15,000, and surrounding hamlets had been overrun. He said the 
assault was led by tanks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Died on Barricades 
</P>
<P>
Another Christian officer said the attack force numbered only "scores" of 
soldiers, and that the Syrian tanks were poised in reserve for a breakthrough 
that was not achieved, according to press reports from Beirut. He said the 
attackers died on barbed-wire barricades around the army positions. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that at least 19 people were killed and 80 
wounded Sunday in the capital. A Christian army communique claimed 150 Syrians 
were killed in the fighting, but a senior army source told the news service 
that 10 Syrians, 20 Druze and 20 Palestinians were confirmed killed in Souq el 
Gharb and that another 12 Syrians were killed in fighting along Beirut's Green 
Line, which divides the city's Christian and Muslim sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Souq el Gharb sits atop a mountain ridge just six miles southeast of the heart 
of Beirut and three miles from Baabda, where Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, the 
Lebanese army commander and Christian leader, directs his forces from a bunker 
beneath the presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
Control of the ridgeline would give Syrian and Druze gunners a clear line of 
fire at Baabda and nearby Yarze, where the Defense Ministry and a number of 
foreign embassies are located, including that of the United States. It would 
also open the back door for a ground assault on Christian-held East Beirut, if 
Syrian President Hafez Assad decides to take that fateful step in his test of 
will with Aoun. The front door lies on the Green Line, and over the past 48 
hours there have been reports of Syrian armor moving in the western, Muslim 
side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Beirut, meanwhile, was on its knees Sunday. There has been no tap water or 
electricity for weeks. Bakeries and drugstores were closed. Newspapers failed 
to publish. 
</P>
<P>
At hospitals in both sectors of the capital, the wounded were sometimes turned 
away. No room was available, and no plasma. Mobile Red Cross teams were taking 
blood donations in the shelters. "The smell of death is everywhere," an East 
Beirut woman told a reporter from Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaders Stand Firm 
</P>
<P>
Voice of Lebanon, the main Christian radio, began its Sunday morning broadcast 
with the words, "A new black day starts in Lebanon . . . but, despite 
everything, good morning." 
</P>
<P>
With civilian fatalities vaulting toward the 600 mark for five months, spurred 
by the four days of crushing artillery battles, both Aoun and Syria's Assad 
refused to budge despite agonized calls for a truce. "One of us has to . . . be 
finished," Aoun told a Beirut-based reporter for the Washington Post on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian radio appealed to Arab countries to pressure Assad. "Where are 
our Arab brethren?" an announcer demanded emotionally. "Beirut is being wiped 
off the face of the Earth. . . . Our wounded are bleeding to death in the 
streets and the basements." 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, the Syrian capital, French diplomat Francois Scheer arrived from 
Paris and went directly into talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh. 
Neither side would discuss the contents of the talks. President Francois 
Mitterrand, renewing a French initiative to halt the shelling, lift port 
blockades and resume negotiations, dispatched Scheer, a high Foreign Ministry 
official, to press the demands made in a French note delivered Friday in 
Damascus calling "with all urgency" for an end to the bombardments. 
</P>
<P>
On both sides of the Green Line, the shelling has driven five out of six 
Beirutis from the capital and left the rest shaking with fear and anger in 
basement shelters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls for Relief 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian response has been obstinacy. "The conspiracy implemented by Aoun is 
clear," declared the government newspaper Tishreen on Saturday. "The Arab 
responsibility requires intensifying efforts to prevent its escalation because 
it does not threaten only Lebanon's security but that of the world." Al Baath, 
the ruling party newspaper, called for the overthrow of Aoun, who heads a 
Christian Cabinet in East Beirut, while Salim Hoss heads a rival Muslim Cabinet 
in the west. The Lebanese government has been divided on sectarian lines since 
last September, when Parliament was unable to choose a successor to outgoing 
President Amin Gemayel. 
</P>
<P>
Since the four days of shelling began Thursday, breaking a lull that coincided 
with the drama of the hostage crisis, the United Nations, Washington, Moscow 
and other capitals have issued calls for relief. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Egypt, resuming its voice as an Arab leader, demanded the withdrawal 
of all foreign forces in Lebanon -- Syrian, Iranian and Israeli. Said Foreign 
Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid: "Egypt calls on all factions to rise to their 
national and historic responsibilities and to seriously resist" any threats to 
Lebanese sovereignty. An Arab League effort to arrange a cease-fire and 
political talks collapsed two weeks ago. The league negotiators blamed Syria. 
Syrian spokesmen blamed Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese general has declared the fighting a "war of liberation" against 
Syrian troops who control two-thirds of Lebanese territory. "No one moves 
without the Syrians' permission," said a Nicosia-based Western diplomat. "They 
have checkpoints between every town and village. Their secret police know 
precisely what's going on in West Beirut, and probably in parts of the eastern 
side." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun adds that he wants all foreign forces out of the country, including the 
Israelis, who hold a six- to 10-mile-deep security strip north of their border 
and, when they choose, command Lebanese skies with impunity. The Israelis have 
armed and supported Christian militias and leaders, with few exceptions, since 
the Christian-Muslim civil war began 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, whose troops first entered Lebanon as peacekeepers, the year after war 
broke out, remains deeply committed there, both politically and militarily. A 
Christian-ruled Lebanon, Damascus officials have pointed out, could tilt toward 
the Israelis in a Middle East war and present Syria with unacceptable security 
problems.

SRI LANKA JOURNALIST SLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Sinhalese radicals burst into the home of a prominent broadcaster and shot 
him to death near Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, military officials said. 
Kulasiri Amaratunga, 62, chief news editor of state television, was the third 
broadcast official to be killed since late July. Officials blamed the killings 
on the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese group that has been waging a 
violent campaign against the government. The militants believe officials are 
too soft on minority Tamil rebels, who are fighting for an independent 
homeland. At least 38 other people died in ethnic violence in Sri Lanka over 
the weekend, officials said. Among the victims were two Buddhist monks, shot to 
death in their temple northeast of Colombo.

5,000 RALLY IN SUPPORT OF LABOR STRIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 5,000 rallied in Pittsburgh, Pa., to support a number of labor strikes -- 
including those at Eastern Airlines, in Appalachian coal mines and at telephone 
companies around the country. Members of dozens of labor unions came to 
Pittsburgh in buses and caravans of cars and trucks. AFL-CIO President Lane 
Kirkland, in a letter read at the rally, urged Congress to intervene in the 
Eastern Airlines dispute and "to recognize the legitimate interests of working 
people." He also chastised President Bush for inaction in the coal strike. 
United Mine Workers President Richard L. Trumka said: "They try to make us 
believe that each one of our disputes is a separate little blip on the screen, 
. . . we're here to tell them that when it affects one of us, it affects every 
last one of us and we'll stand together."

Philadelphia's chief medical examiner has developed an ominous theory about the 
mysterious deaths of 10 babies, according to a published report. Pathologist 
Haresh Mirchandani said the children may have breathed in cocaine while it was 
being smoked by the adults around them. "I have no doubt it came from passive 
smoke inhalation, around the immediate vicinity of the infant," he told the 
Philadelphia Inquirer. The medical examiner's study included the cases of 10 
children ranging in age from 28 days to 10 months who died in 1987, 1988 and 
1989. All had cocaine or its chemical residue in their blood, tissue or organs. 
He said more research was needed to substantiate his theory but said the cases 
might mark the first time such a lethal phenomenon has been documented in the 
United States.

The gay president of the Fremont school board is facing a recall drive. The 
Fremont Family Alliance won Alameda County approval to circulate petitions and 
has until Jan. 10 to collect the signatures of at least 12,219 of Fremont's 
81,495 registered voters in an effort to recall Robert Stipicevich. The 
alliance contends that Stipicevich presents impressionable students with a role 
model for homosexuality. Stipicevich suggested that the alliance is "a little 
bit shady" because leaders of the group meet in private and are secretive about 
membership.

The state Office of Emergency Services lifted a five-day earthquake advisory 
for San Francisco, saying the likelihood of another earthquake in the area 
shaken last week has returned to normal. Shortly after a strong quake jolted 
the Bay Area on Tuesday, the office warned that the chances of another 
earthquake in the same area would be increased for the next five days. There 
were several aftershocks to the magnitude 5.1 earthquake, which caused some 
damage and was blamed for one death, but no new shakers.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will meet the leaders of two traditionally 
pro-Communist political parties today to discuss forming a non-Communist 
coalition government in Poland, his aides said. They said he will meet in 
Warsaw with Roman Malinowski, leader of the United Peasants' Party, and Jerzy 
Jozwiak, head of the Democratic Party. Walesa called last week for a government 
excluding the Communist Party and uniting his movement with the two small 
parties, which have suggested they want a more independent role. Czeslaw 
Kiszczak, a Communist named as premier Aug. 2, is trying to persuade Solidarity 
to join a "grand coalition" government.

GETTING A U.S. GRANT -- HOW THE SYSTEM REALLY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a classic case of how Washington works -- of how insiders can use their 
connections to circumvent the bureaucratic procedures that can pose obstacles 
to those without special access. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it demonstrates that political clout is a two-edged sword 
that can cut surely through bureaucratic red tape but can also turn on the 
wielder, with painful results. 
</P>
<P>
The tale began in 1987 when Yeshiva Rav Isacshon, a well-regarded private 
Orthodox Jewish primary school in the Beverly-Fairfax area of Los Angeles, 
decided to seek federal aid to start a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of approaching the faceless Washington bureaucracy directly, the Los 
Angeles group's first call was to a politically well-connected Brooklyn, N.Y., 
rabbi named Milton Balkany, who boasted that he met regularly at the White 
House with then-Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan. Balkany went to Regan on the 
yeshiva's behalf, and Regan put him in touch with the undersecretary of health 
and human services. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of weeks, Oakwood Child Development Center Inc., the corporation 
that the yeshiva had created to seek federal aid, had won a $1.8-million 
Department of Health and Human Services grant to buy a building at 555 N. La 
Brea Ave. and start a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Money Returned 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Los Angeles group, however, what looked at first to be a 
successful maneuver has turned into a tangled controversy and the government is 
now demanding its money back. The yeshiva, in turn, has called out even more 
political clout, including Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and several of his 
congressional colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
At Balkany's urging, Wilson has sponsored a bill, opposed by the Department of 
Health and Human Services, that would permit the Los Angeles group to use the 
money in a manner that does not have the government's approval. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a candidate for governor, received $2,000 in contributions -- the 
maximum allowable under law -- from Balkany and his wife, Sara, during his 
primary Senate reelection campaign last year. But he says the contributions did 
not influence his decision to offer the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Yeshiva Rav Isacshon's initial decision to seek federal funds for a day-care 
center grew out of its effort to expand its own operations, which are located 
across the street from the La Brea Avenue building. According to local 
officials, Yeshiva Rav Isacshon has recently been searching for ways to expand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rabbi's Explanation 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yakov Krause, education director at Yeshiva Rav Isacshon, said in an 
interview that the school created the Oakwood organization primarily to seek 
government funding for the day-care center. He said the group contacted Balkany 
because it needed advice on how to obtain federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Balkany, an old school friend of Krause, is a conservative Republican who 
during the last election contributed thousands of dollars to Vice President 
George Bush's presidential campaign and to 14 GOP Senate candidates. By his own 
account, Balkany is so well known in Washington that he has been chosen to 
offer the invocation at an annual dinner honoring the President for the last 
several years, and he once even declined an invitation to become the rabbi 
chaplain of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
It was Balkany's close relationship with Regan that prompted Oakwood to contact 
him, he said. "The reason that they called me to get involved was because I 
had, at that time, with the chief of staff in the White House, a meeting every 
two or three weeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Balkany first talked with Regan in early 1987 about Oakwood's desire for a 
federal grant, according to the rabbi, Regan summoned a White House car to 
drive him across town to meet personally with Donald Newman, then 
undersecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
Balkany recalled that department officials instructed Oakwood to hire Robert 
Brandwein, a Boston consultant, to put together the funding request, and 
Brandwein received $6,500 for preparing the application. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 11, 1987, Oakwood formally applied for a $2.3-million community 
services block grant. Although the request far exceeded the $500,000 limit that 
the department had set for such grants, the department awarded Oakwood $1.8 
million on an "urgent" basis two weeks later without having an independent 
review of it or comparing it with other grant applications. 
</P>
<P>
On the day that the Department of Health and Human Services handed over 
Oakwood's grant check, Balkany recalls, top-level department officials -- some 
of them wearing yarmulkes in his honor -- hosted a champagne reception in 
Newman's office. The rabbi was asked to say a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
The community services block grant program makes about $300 million available 
each year for projects designed to create jobs for low-income people. While the 
money normally goes to state and local governments, Health and Human Services 
officials are permitted to grant some money directly to local groups such as 
Oakwood. Knowledgeable sources said a portion of these discretionary funds 
usually go to reward political supporters of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
To receive the grant, Oakwood had to sign a pledge stating: "No portion of any 
property or facility acquired or renovated in whole or in part with funds 
awarded or otherwise acquired pursuant to this application will be used for 
religious worship, sectarian instruction or any other religious purpose." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflict With Pledge 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after acquiring the building, however, Oakwood officials sought 
permission to use private funds to build additional floors on the structure, to 
be used as classroom space by the yeshiva. The government first accepted but 
ultimately rejected the plan as a violation of Oakwood's pledge to conduct only 
non-sectarian activities in the building. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year after receiving the grant, Oakwood applied for a one-year 
extension and was turned down -- the first such recipient of a department grant 
ever denied an extension. Instead, department officials ordered Oakwood to sell 
the property at 555 N. La Brea Ave. and return all the money to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood appealed that order, and a department appeals board is reviewing the 
appeal. Meanwhile, the La Brea Avenue building stands idle, except for one room 
that is being rented as office space. 
</P>
<P>
As government attorneys see it, Oakwood officials were more intent upon using 
the building for Yeshiva Rav Isacshon students than creating day care for 
preschool children. "Oakwood didn't do its project because it was so very busy 
trying to do another project," declared Madeline Neese, a Department of Health 
and Human Services attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Oakwood project contend that the department treated their 
project unfairly. They charge that the department contributed to the delay by 
failing to respond quickly to their requests for changes in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason why the project was not completed in the one-year period was 
because (the department) has never replied to any of our requests for 
clarification, etc., in a timely fashion," Joseph Bobker, an Oakwood official, 
complained in a letter to the department in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from testimony at the department's appeals board hearing, much of 
Oakwood's trouble with the bureaucracy appears to stem from the way its grant 
was obtained. Government sources said Oakwood would never have received such a 
large grant without the help of Balkany. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Health and Human Services employees testified that Balkany even 
tried to ease the way for Oakwood at the department by promising to help one 
top official obtain a better job in the Administration. That same official 
testified that he received free tickets to a $1,500-a-plate political dinner 
for President Ronald Reagan, where Balkany offered the prayer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Officials Involved 
</P>
<P>
But the rabbi's political influence apparently began to wane as the officials 
who approved the grant were replaced by others less sympathetic to the Oakwood 
project. Balkany sought Wilson's support for the project shortly after Oakwood 
received the grant in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in an interview, said he decided to support the project many months 
before receiving campaign donations from Balkany and his wife in late 1987. He 
dismissed the $2,000 in contributions as insignificant -- nothing more than "a 
tiny fraction of 1%" of the total cost of his $14-million reelection campaign 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson offered his legislation in the Senate last March 8, six months after 
Oakwood was ordered by the government to return the grant on grounds that it 
was not being spent in accordance with the original proposal the group had 
submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would permit Oakwood -- if it wins its legal battle with the 
department to keep its grant -- to use the building as a community center for 
senior citizens as well as for child care. It also would allow both programs to 
be staffed by local university students, who would be housed at the Oakwood 
center. The bill is silent on whether the center could be used for sectarian 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials strongly oppose the bill. Spokesman David Siegel said it 
"would circumvent the department processes for making and administering grants" 
and "would afford preferential treatment to one grantee over other 
organizations and agencies which likewise seek support for their projects." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has tried other ways to help Oakwood. In 1987, according to aides, he 
sought unsuccessfully to obtain additional money for Oakwood in an 
appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capitol Hill Connections 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Balkany had previously called upon his political contacts on Capitol 
Hill to help Oakwood. A number of other recipients of Balkany's campaign 
contributions, such as Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), have made appeals to 
the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rep. Vin Weber (R-Minn.), another recipient of campaign 
contributions from Balkany, tried last year to give Oakwood an additional $1.8 
million for the child-care project without seeking the approval of the 
Department of Health and Human Services. Weber's efforts to write the 
appropriation into law failed, apparently as a result of opposition from Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, whose congressional district includes the Beverly-Fairfax area, said in 
an interview that he originally supported the Oakwood project but changed his 
mind on the basis of Oakwood's dismal record of dealings with the department. 
He added that he also opposes the plan for Oakwood as outlined in Wilson's 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, 
Waxman described Wilson's support for Oakwood as "illogical and inappropriate" 
and added: "I do not believe any federal expenditures should be made on the 
basis of political or personal friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, if the department's appeals board rules that Oakwood can keep the 
money, Wilson expects the Senate to approve his legislation quickly.

RAIDERS MAY EXIT BY SAME DOOR THEY ENTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ironically, the very legal decision loudly applauded in Los Angeles because it 
enabled the Raiders to move south seven years ago from Oakland has opened the 
way for the team to seek yet another new home. 
</P>
<P>
By limiting the power of National Football League owners to block team moves 
from city to city, the decision left all teams much freer to relocate. At the 
same time, it encouraged the kind of bidding war now going on among four cities 
-- Oakland, Sacramento, Los Angeles and Irwindale -- for the Raider franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Blecher, the attorney who represented the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission in the suit to allow the Raiders to move, remarks now, of the 
result: 
</P>
<P>
"It enhanced the value of every pro franchise. People are now laying money at 
(Raiders owner) Al Davis' feet, and he's quite open in saying that he'll go to 
the place that best lures him." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there are signs of resistance to giving him everything he might 
want, and nowhere more than in Los Angeles, where even some of Davis' biggest 
boosters are distancing themselves a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, for instance, what Mayor Tom Bradley's attitude is to the negotiations, 
Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said a week ago, "We want to keep the Raiders, but we 
don't want to be raped." Some city councilmen have cautioned against allowing 
public money to be used to make any cash payments to Davis, and there have been 
pledges by the Coliseum's private business managers that it won't be. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, as well, the use of public money in the proposed deal remains 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
But this resistance occurs against a backdrop of ever bigger offers -- like the 
ones that brought new teams to Indianapolis and Phoenix in recent years -- by 
cities seeking to lure NFL teams to a new home. 
</P>
<P>
The suit that brought the Raiders to Los Angeles has even worked out to the 
financial benefit of the league, according to Frank Rothman, the attorney who 
represented the NFL in the court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman points out: "Now, the NFL takes the position that when a franchise is 
moved from one city to another, if the new city is worth more as a property 
than the franchise given up, then the NFL is entitled to be compensated. All of 
these cities that do not have NFL teams are expansion opportunities that have 
economic value, and they belong to the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Out of this concept comes the "franchise fee," and cities desiring NFL 
franchises are often told they must pay such a fee, amounting to $30 million or 
more in cash. But just whether this will be paid to the owners bringing in the 
team or the NFL as a whole, remains a matter of negotiation. Most of the time, 
it has gone to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, no one is readier to take credit for the turn of events than Davis 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Azoff of MCA Inc., one of the Los Angeles Coliseum private managers 
attempting to keep the Raiders in the Coliseum, says Davis tells how other 
owners frequently compliment him, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"You invented the franchise fee. You improved the value of every NFL franchise 
by $50 million." 
</P>
<P>
And this may be an understatement considering that in the present bidding for 
the Raiders, Davis has been offered stadium projects and cash inducements 
totaling more than $150 million each in Irwindale, Sacramento and Los Angeles, 
and a reported $82 million in Oakland for what would amount only to a stadium 
expansion plus a "franchise fee" for moving back to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something that's bad," Davis' attorney, Joseph Alioto, commented 
last week. "It's a free enterprise system now. Anybody has a right to move to 
improve his situation. Prior to our case, the NFL was like a cartel. But since, 
there have been some marvelous deals. Indianapolis is perhaps the best example, 
with its 10-year guarantee to fully reimburse the Colts for anything less than 
full attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Raider-Coliseum lawsuit ruling against the NFL is not the only 
factor that has enhanced the value of league franchises. 
</P>
<P>
A close observer of professional football who asked not to be identified points 
out that the NFL has not expanded in 15 years and that, at most, only two 
expansion teams are contemplated now, at an uncertain date in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The restriction of the number of available franchises has worked to drive up 
the prices of existing franchises, he asserted, as cities without pro football 
teams that desire them bid ever higher for them. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent bidding war, Davis has proven an adept strategist. He sits 
back and waits for competing cities to make ever more lucrative offers for his 
team. Just this last weekend, the San Francisco Examiner reported that 
Sacramento interests had increased their cash inducement from $35 million to 
$50 million in an effort to outdo Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiating Tactic 
</P>
<P>
"Davis knows how to keep his mouth shut," says one local sports journalist who 
has dealt with him a long time. "Like (the late) Carroll Rosenbloom (of the Los 
Angeles Rams), when he negotiates, he never makes a proposal." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Saturday night's extremely low attendance of only 31,135 at 
the Raiders' first exhibition game in the Coliseum, and the team's 37-7 
shellacking at the hands of the San Francisco 49ers, may put pressure on Davis 
to come to a quicker decision. As long as reports proliferate that the team may 
move, attendance and interest in Los Angeles, and the morale of the team, are 
likely to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Grossman, the attorney representing the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission in its pending $57-million breach-of-contract lawsuit against the 
Raiders, nonetheless remarks: "Davis seems to have a history of out-negotiating 
whoever is on the other side. . . . He was successful in that with Irwindale. 
He got $10 million in his pants pocket from them before the financing for that 
deal was arranged." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it appears likely that Irwindale may never come up with adequate financing 
for its proposed stadium, and the Raiders owner in those circumstances is 
likely to keep the $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The chore of the Coliseum Commission, Grossman declares, "is to try to keep 
Davis (as a tenant) and not give away the store to him. 
</P>
<P>
"But that becomes very difficult in today's environment, where money is simply 
thrown at these professional teams. . . . Davis is simply playing everyone off 
against another, doing it very skillfully. When he sees what everybody is 
offering, he will pick the proposal that is best for the Raiders. As long as 
the bidding continues to go up, there's no reason for him to pick." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Explain Inaction 
</P>
<P>
Grossman's theory, if correct, explains why Davis has not chosen among bidders 
yet, despite frequent press reports that he is on the verge of moving north and 
has refused to say publicly when he will make up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Despite last week's new break in Los Angeles Coliseum-Raider negotiations, and 
reported negotiating hang-ups in his dealings with both Sacramento and 
Irwindale, the chairman of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, George Vukasin, 
was extremely cautious last week in predicting when Davis may make up his mind 
on the Oakland offer. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if an announcement of a Raider move back to Oakland might be made Aug. 
26, when the Raiders are scheduled to play an exhibition game in Oakland 
against the Houston Oilers, their first return to the Oakland Coliseum since 
the 1981 season, Vukasin said: 
</P>
<P>
"Anything's conceivable, but I anticipate they will take a sufficient time to 
fully review the document (a tentative agreement) we have submitted to them, 
and to look at alternatives they have of playing elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland official said he has invited Davis and his wife to speak at a 
dinner being given in Oakland the night before the exhibition game that will 
honor six former Raider players who are in football's Hall of Fame, but that so 
far no reply has been received. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Vukasin added, "I would expect that the L.A. Raiders probably 
would remain in Los Angeles to the end of their contract (with the Coliseum)." 
</P>
<P>
That would put off any move to the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, as has been the case for months, was "unavailable for comment" on what 
he will do. 
</P>
<P>
Quite aside from which bidder offers the most, however, Davis will probably be 
asking himself which party is most likely to make good on its promises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purported Promises 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders owner frequently points to promises that he contends were made to 
him in 1980, 1981 and 1982 as proof that the Coliseum failed to perform for 
him. He says these broken promises are what led to his break with the Coliseum 
Commission two years ago. (A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has questioned 
whether oral promises were made to Davis about Coliseum renovation by Los 
Angeles and has declared in any case that they would not be binding.) 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Davis has found that Irwindale encountered all kinds of 
obstacles in performing on its 1987 memorandum of agreement with the team, with 
a changing lineup of city officials frequently seeking to renegotiate the 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Irwindale has a financing offer on the table, but sources acquainted 
with it say it is contingent on so many things that Davis is dubious about its 
acceptability. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a big Japanese land development company involved, and they hope to 
get the land for the stadium and other planned developments for $50 million," 
remarks a businessman who is conversant with the proposal. "I don't think 
they're going to ever get it for close to that. And condemnation would take a 
long, long time at least. And this is just the land. The $125-million loan for 
the stadium construction, and the cash advances to Davis, are extra." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Gregg Lukenbill, a partner in the Sacramento Kings basketball 
franchise, has spearheaded plans to build a stadium for Davis, but he and his 
associates reportedly want a share in the ownership of the team that Davis and 
his Raider partners are reluctant to give. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, initial City Council reaction to a proposed $32-million cash 
payment to the Raiders as a "franchise fee" was negative, and concern has been 
expressed by some officials about a report that part of the offer would put up 
public money for any shortfall in ticket sales necessary to sell out the 
stadium for Raider games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Efforts at Secrecy 
</P>
<P>
Since the skepticism emerged, those Oakland officials negotiating with the 
Raiders have done their best to keep the details of their latest offer secret. 
"It is totally inappropriate to negotiate in the press or to discuss any 
negotiations until they're finalized," Vukasin said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters, the owners of the San Francisco 49ers have demanded they 
be compensated if the Raiders move back into the Bay Area. But Alioto said last 
week he has already informed the 49ers no compensation would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Azoff, the Coliseum private management official, has talked of 
assembling $155 million in private money to underwrite the offer to be made to 
Davis, assuming that negotiations resume. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when the talks were broken off as a result of inability of the 
parties to agree on keeping their discussions from being used in court 
proceedings on a Coliseum Commission lawsuit against the team, Azoff was openly 
discouraged. "We're down to desperate time," he remarked. 
</P>
<P>
There are questions about whether Los Angeles can deliver on the offer it is 
planning to make. Can private funding be found? Will an environmental impact 
report be required on the Coliseum renovation? Would preservationists try to 
block the project, which would demolish all but the historic east peristyle of 
the present Coliseum facility, the host to the 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games? 
Would there be community opposition? These factors might result in considerable 
delays.

The government announced Sunday that it will temporarily close its embassy in 
Hungary today because it has been swamped by East Germans who refuse to leave 
the building unless they receive asylum or visa documents to travel to the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
The move came on the 28th anniversary of the start of construction of the 
Berlin Wall by East Germany. The anniversary was marked by demonstrations on 
both sides of the wall and an apparent failed attempt by an East German man to 
flee to the West through Checkpoint Charlie, a major crossing point. 
</P>
<P>
The move to close the embassy in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, followed last 
week's decision by Bonn to shut its mission in East Germany because of a 
similar influx of East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
The influx into West German missions in East Berlin, Budapest, Warsaw, Prague 
and Belgrade has caused a serious rift with the East German regime and 
embarrassment with the Hungarian, Polish, Czechoslovak and Yugoslav 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
The East German government, through its controlled press, has accused West 
Germany and its media of fomenting the surge of East Germans who are attempting 
to leave that country, which is under the repressive leadership of hard-liner 
Erich Honecker. As a lower ranking official at the time, Honecker supervised 
construction of the wall, built to halt the flight of hundreds of thousands of 
East Germans fleeing the Communist regime. Construction began on Aug. 13, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, 10 East Germans among the 131 who had holed up in the West German 
mission in East Berlin were reported to have left the building after 
unsuccessfully applying for West German documents. 
</P>
<P>
Although all East Germans are entitled to West German passports under the West 
German constitution, Bonn officials say they will not issue such documents 
inside Communist countries because it would not help the would-be immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"If we gave them passports or visas, they still have to go through official 
procedures in Eastern countries to get out," a Foreign Ministry official said 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither the East Germans nor the Hungarians are allowing people with such 
documents to leave, so stamping visas into their East German documents just 
makes things worse for them." 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn embassy in Budapest has about 180 East Germans, who traveled to 
Hungary on vacation and then sought to gain visas. After they were turned down, 
they refused to leave the building. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials here say that it is against government policy to forcibly 
remove East Germans from their missions in Communist states. 
</P>
<P>
"The capacity of the mission in Budapest is absolutely exhausted," said the 
Bonn Foreign Ministry. "The embassy must therefore be closed to the public from 
Monday until further notice." 
</P>
<P>
However, in an unsigned letter to the West German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, 
some of the East Germans in Budapest accused the embassy staff of threatening 
to expel them by force. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not ask -- we demand that something should be done by the German public 
to protect us from being pushed back into the (East German) zone," said the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials admit that living conditions inside their missions for 
would-be immigrants are difficult, with a limited number of beds, showers and 
toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those in the Budapest embassy failed in their attempts to cross the 
Hungarian border into Austria, a popular escape route since Hungary removed 
much of the wire fencing along its frontier two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.5 million East Germans, or 9% of the population, are estimated 
to have applied officially for permission to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
At least 80,000 are expected to be granted exit permits this year, but the 
others will have to wait indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number applying to leave has been boosted partly by the 
willingness of the East German authorities to grant more applications and 
partly because of the depressing living standards in the country, which has 
resisted economic and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The highly visible plight of the East Germans has reportedly angered Communist 
leader Honecker, because it has focused European attention on his failure to 
solve the country's economic problems or introduce political reforms, as his 
Polish and Hungarian allies in the Warsaw Pact have done. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, security forces dispersed about 50 East Germans who tried to 
demonstrate at the West German mission to mark Sunday's anniversary of the 
Berlin Wall, the Associated Press reported. Witnesses said the demonstrators 
tried to lay flowers at the mission gates. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified assailant hurled a firebomb at the wall near the Brandenburg 
Gate early Sunday, West German police said. The bomb exploded when it crashed 
against the wall but caused no serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
The East German state news agency ADN said several masked assailants from West 
Berlin damaged border barriers in the southern sector of East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
ADN, which did not describe the damage, said a diplomatic protest would be 
lodged with West Berlin authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses at the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing said that at least one man 
who attempted to flee across the heavily guarded frontier just before noon was 
arrested by East German border guards before reaching Western territory.

UNREST IN ESTONIA TESTS KREMLIN'S RISKY POLICY

<P>
Galina Rybanskaya, an ethnic Russian, has lived comfortably for 28 years in the 
Baltic republic of Estonia, but now she is troubled as never before by what she 
delicately calls "elements of discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Sasha Kopytina, also Russian, married an Estonian and moved to the republic 
just a year ago. "I had planned to stay here all my life, but now I don't know. 
My rights are being restricted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both women, whose comments appeared in the Socialist Industry newspaper over 
the weekend, are among about 50,000 Russians from 40 enterprises who are 
staging a counter-rebellion in the tiny republic on the shores of the Baltic 
and the Gulf of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Russians who live in Estonia have been striking for nearly a week to try to 
pressure Moscow to rein in Estonian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
The strike, which threatens to seriously disrupt passenger and cargo rail 
traffic originating in the port city of Tallinn, the republic's capital, goes 
to the heart of a national crisis in inter-ethnic relations and presents a 
serious challenge to the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risky Bid in Conflicts 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has permitted some republics greater freedom in a risky bid to defuse 
ethnic conflicts and dissuade the republics' parliaments from voting to secede 
from the Soviet Union, a move theoretically permissible under the Soviet 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Many ethnic Russians -- the majority in the Soviet Union and long secure in 
positions of power throughout the country -- are being forced to relinquish 
control in some outlying republics to local ethnic groups, and they are 
watching warily to see how far the power sharing will go. 
</P>
<P>
In Estonia, many feel it has gone far enough. The strike is a warning to Moscow 
that the Russians won't sit by passively if they fear their way of life is 
being endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Parliament, responding to demands from the Estonian Popular Front 
movement, agreed last month to grant Estonians freedom from central economic 
planning and the right to make decisions about their own economy. 
</P>
<P>
Republic authorities have been permitted to fly their previously outlawed flag 
and to make Estonian the republic's official language. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Russians have complained bitterly that each of these steps encroaches on their 
rights, and they formed an opposition group of their own, known as 
Inter-Movement, which claims to have 90,000 members in Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
Inter-Movement spokesmen have argued against putting industrial enterprises 
with a predominantly Russian-speaking labor force under Estonian control. 
</P>
<P>
They have opposed the language requirement as unreasonable, saying language 
classes are largely unavailable and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
But the proverbial last straw was a vote last week by the Estonian legislature 
requiring a minimum of two years residency in one district or five in the 
republic in order to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian Popular Front hopes the new law will enable it to keep Russians 
out of positions of power and install independent-minded Estonians instead. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never agree to this," strike committee spokesman Mikhail Lysenko, an 
ethnic Russian, was quoted as saying in Socialist Industry's Sunday edition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
120,000 Non-Estonians 
</P>
<P>
He said the regulations would disenfranchise about 120,000 non-Estonians, 
primarily Russians, who are living in the republic on short-term work 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Just over 25% of the republic's population of 1.5 million is Russian and about 
65% is Estonian, with the rest made up of other ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Justice Minister Vinyamin F. Yakovlev has said the Estonian voting law 
is unconstitutional. But the Estonian Parliament defiantly declared last 
November that its local laws take precedence over national laws, and republic 
authorities are not likely to back down willingly. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonians, for their part, have said the Russians' strike is illegal, and 
officials in the republic have imposed fines on strike leaders. But the ethnic 
Russians have refused to negotiate with the Estonian leadership and have 
instead sent a delegation to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts say that ethnic minorities outside of Estonia will be watching 
carefully to see how the Kremlin handles the Russian rebellion in the Baltics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pretext to Crush Rebellion 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin could use the Russian rebellion as a pretext to crush the Estonian 
independence movement, one Western analyst said, but he added that may simply 
add fuel to ethnic protests in other republics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the Russians have in many cases acted like 
occupiers. They've been oblivious to the cultures and desires of other ethnic 
groups," the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Estonians don't seem to want to share power, a senior Western diplomat noted. 
They instead have tried to shut out the Russians, and Moscow is concerned that 
the election law "may be the first step on a slippery slope," said the 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
The fear, the diplomat said, is that Estonians could next enact residency 
requirements, preventing Russians from even living in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic hostility in Estonia is likely to intensify next week when 
demonstrations are expected to mark the 50th anniversary of the Soviet 
nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed on Aug. 23, 1939, included secret protocols that led to the 
incorporation into the Soviet Union of then-independent Estonia and its Baltic 
neighbors, Latvia and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in the Baltic republics argue that the secret protocols were illegal 
and should be declared null and void, and Soviet sources say a government 
commission studying the pact, whose findings have not yet been released, will 
concur.

4 KIDNAPERS IN BRAZIL ESCAPE IN PLANE AFTER 3-DAY STANDOFF

Four heavily armed fugitives in south-central Brazil on Sunday released their 
three hostages, including two television reporters, and made a getaway in a 
plane provided by authorities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the four traded their captives for an aircraft and 
pilot to end a three-day standoff with police on a highway near the town of 
Presidente Prudente, 635 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro. They were armed 
with hand grenades, submachine guns, pistols and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the hostages were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived for four days with a pistol at my head, but not for one minute did I 
believe I would die," said Monica Calassa, one of the hostages. "A person who 
trades her life for that of another can't die like that." 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear where the plane was headed. The fugitives -- two married 
couples -- earlier said they wanted to be flown to Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian media identified the fugitives' leader as Rui Ribeiro de Campos and 
said he owns a farm in Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, three local journalists offered to take the place of a 9-year-old 
boy the fugitives had kidnaped Aug. 3. The fugitives were also paid a $25,000 
ransom and given an armored car and a driver. The kidnapers later released one 
of the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
However, Goias state authorities on Wednesday failed to provide a plane for 
their escape, and the kidnapers began leading police on a 500-mile chase 
through three states.

More than 150 people have died in violence involving Bodo tribesmen in 
northeast India's Assam state over the past four days, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
S.M. Thiruvengadam, deputy director of the Assam state intelligence bureau, 
said more than 120 bodies had been brought out of jungles along the border 
between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh states in the past 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of those killed were women and children," said M.P. Bezboruah, Assam's 
home commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel Bodo tribesmen have been fighting the Assamese for their own state within 
India since last February, claiming that the Assam government discriminates 
against them. More than 400 people have been killed in the insurgency.

GOOD WEATHER AIDING AQUEDUCT REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Another sunny day aided heavy equipment crews as they worked round-the-clock 
Sunday to clear tons of mud and debris that last week's thunderstorms and flash 
floods dumped into a two-mile stretch of the Los Angeles Aqueduct near Olancha, 
180 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on schedule for our two-week completion date. Things are progressing as 
we had expected," said Department of Water and Power spokesman Ed Freudenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect the aqueduct, which provides 75% of Los Angeles' water supply, 
to be back in operation by Aug. 25 or 26. 
</P>
<P>
Freudenberg said repairs will begin early this week on 80 concrete slabs, each 
10-by-13-feet and four-inches thick, that line the aqueduct. A storm last 
Tuesday piled mud and debris into the big ditch, and a second storm Thursday 
buckled about 1,000 feet of the concrete lining. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cautious Use of Water 
</P>
<P>
Freudenberg renewed his request Sunday for consumers "to be mindful of how they 
use water," while stressing that no shortages will result from the interrupted 
aqueduct supply. 
</P>
<P>
During the two-week repairs, water is being drawn from two reservoirs south of 
the damaged area -- Haiwee about five miles from the blockage, and Bouquet near 
Saugus. The Bouquet Reservoir was nearly full in anticipation of a regular 
maintenance shutdown of the aqueduct planned in September, Freudenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also purchasing 350 million gallons of water a day from the 
Metropolitan Water District, about 250 million gallons more than normal at this 
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the department proceeds with the planned shutdown of the aqueduct for 
needed routine repairs in September may depend on how much of the water stored 
for that project must be used now, Freudenberg said.

THERE'S NO TIME LIKE PRESENT FOR NAVRATILOVA; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYING THE BEST SHE HAS IN TWO YEARS, SHE SWEEPS SABATINI, 6-0, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just to prove there is nothing new under the sun, Martina Navratilova won 
another tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
She has won 143 of them now, which means that except for the Grand Slams, it 
may be hard to tell one from the other. 
</P>
<P>
But at 32, age sometimes has a funny way of telling tennis players it's time to 
get out of this racket. Things like going into your swing and the ball is 
already bouncing back off the wall behind you. 
</P>
<P>
So for at least a brief moment on a sunny Sunday at Manhattan Country Club, 
Navratilova was her young self again. 
</P>
<P>
Her 6-0, 6-2 victory over Gabriela Sabatini in the Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles was more than just a triumph of No. 2 over No. 3 in the rankings or a 
victory over someone 13 years her junior. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Navratilova didn't only beat Sabatini, she proved once again that 
she can still beat the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very strong," Sabatini said. "She's still playing very good tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said the tennis she played was her best in two years. Some may be 
surprised by that, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been writing me off for years," Navratilova said. "Well, I'm still 
No. 2. If Steffi hadn't had such a phenomenal two years, I'd still be No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at it like I'm slipping that much," she said. "I don't think that 
age has anything to do with it. Experience does count for something. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have lost a quarter of a step -- which I don't think I have because (my 
opponents) have told me I haven't -- I certainly have gained more with 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Experience is sometimes a fickle ally, though. It only has value when you use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the last time she played Navratilova, Sabatini knew before the 
final that she would have to break Navratilova's serve, preferably early. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to put pressure on Navratilova's serve and see how it held up. 
When Sabatini won the coin toss, she elected to receive and her strategy 
immediately appeared wise. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini held two break points in the first game of the match, but Navratilova 
saved them both. If ever the first game of a match is a turning point, this was 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe I got a little bit nervous," Sabatini said. "She was coming to 
the net all the time and I couldn't get into the match. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I am doing too many mistakes and doing nothing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is what Sabatini scored in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini didn't win her first game until the second game of the second set and 
she nearly blew that. Navratilova had three break points of her own and missed 
them all, the game finally going to Sabatini on a wicked backhand cross-court 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, probably because of her successful pressure tactics in the first 
set, Navratilova was in control. 
</P>
<P>
In the next game, Navratilova again fell behind, 15-40, but she came up with 
two big serves to force deuce and then held for 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini's own service strategy was to place the first serve in safely and not 
necessarily hit it with power. It didn't work because Navratilova was ready to 
tee off. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sabatini made 84% of her first serves, she got only 44% of the points. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should have hit it a little bit more," Sabatini said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but even then, Sabatini had nothing to match Navratilova's volleys, 
which may not be unusual because no one in women's tennis does. 
</P>
<P>
Example: Serving at 4-2 but down a break point, Navratilova hits a short ball 
and moves in where she can only watch Sabatini wind up and crush a forehand 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
But, wait. Navratilova flicks her racket out at just the right instant and pops 
a perfect backhand cross-court volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some really good volleys," Navratilova said modestly. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Navratilova saved four break points in that game, which turned out to 
be Sabatini's last chance. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it was over quickly. Navratilova had taken a 3-1 lead on a service 
break. At 30-30, Navratilova's backhand cross-court volley winner set up break 
point. Sabatini rushed into a double fault. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Navratilova did not know it, but she was looking at her 143rd 
match point. To celebrate, she angled a forehand volley winner past Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few more minutes, Navratilova was accepting the winner's check of 
$60,000. What it meant seemed pretty important at the moment to Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
"I know now that I can play as well as I have in the past," she said. "I don't 
care how badly Gaby played, you beat her love and two and you must have played 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
But Navratilova is not sure that beating Sabatini in such a manner will have 
any residual effect. These younger players, well, they're not intimidated any 
longer by big scores, no matter if they're produced by legends. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, players don't show any respect," Navratilova said. "But it doesn't 
matter. What matters is that I've shown I'm playing pretty good tennis right 
now. Hopefully, I can keep it up." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
How do you beat topspin? Martina Navratilova's tactic: "I took the ball on the 
rise and didn't wait for it. That also didn't give Gabriela time to set up." . 
. . Navratilova is a five-time champion of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles. 
She also won in 1978, 1980, 1983 and 1986. Navratilova's career earnings are 
$14.5 million, including $502,464 this year. . . . Navratilova and Wendy 
Turnbull won the doubles title over Claudia Kohde-Kilsch and Mary Joe Fernandez 
by default when Kohde-Kilsch pulled a muscle in her shoulder. Navratilova and 
Turnbull led, 5-2, in the first set. . . . Navratilova's last warmup for the 
U.S. Open is the Players Challenge Canadian Open, starting Aug. 21 in Toronto. 
. . . Sunday's attendance of 6,296 increased the tournament total to a record 
59,007.

STANDINGS OVERRIDDEN BY DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't happen often, but sometimes teams play like there are no standings. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was one of those times for the Dodgers, who today are 11 games out of 
first place but walking like pennant contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing the San Francisco Giants, 2-1, in eighth inning, the Dodgers used a 
diving catch, a diving hit, a Jay Howell marathon and a Mike Scioscia ballet to 
win, 3-2, in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the largest Candlestick Park crowd of the season (53,821) in a game 
the National League West-leading Giants attacked with playoff desperation 
(starter Don Robinson was the loser in relief), the Dodgers left the field with 
more than a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in this game, it doesn't matter where you are or where you are going 
to finish," Randolph said. "Sometimes, you just can't let teams think they are 
better than you." 
</P>
<P>
It was Randolph's run-scoring double in the eighth inning off Craig Lefferts 
that tied the score moments after Alfredo Griffin singled. In the bottom of the 
eighth reliever Howell appeared for the start of four scoreless innings, his 
longest stint as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened. Flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the Dodgers of last year," Giant starter Kelly Downs said. 
"Everything went their way." 
</P>
<P>
With Brett Butler on first base and two out in the bottom of the eighth, Will 
Clark drove a ball into the right-field gap for the potential game-winner. 
Center fielder Jose Gonzalez made a diving, sliding catch to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Four innings later, Scioscia led off the 12th with a ball that found the gap in 
left field for a double. Billy Bean's bunt bounced over first baseman's Clark's 
head for a single, moving Scioscia to third. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin grounded a ball to shortstop Jose Uribe for a certain double play that 
would have left Scioscia at third. But Scioscia charged off third to force a 
rundown. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia kept the Giants busy between third base and home plate until the 
runners reached second and third. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do it very often," Scioscia said with a grin. "It was just a play we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
It is something third base coach Joe Amalfitano frequently discusses with his 
players. When there are runners on first and third with less than two out and 
the batter hits a possible double-play grounder, the runner on third must 
distract the fielder away from throwing to second base to start the double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get out in the rundown and stay there as long as I could," said 
Scioscia, who stutter-stepped and deked for what seemed like 30 seconds. "It's 
not a nice feeling caught in a rundown. But I had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Amalfitano: "Sometimes, what you talk about works. And that's nice." 
</P>
<P>
With one out and Bean on third, all it took was Mike Sharperson's pinch-hit fly 
out to center field to score him with the winning run. Not that it was easy. 
Behind 0 and 2, Sharperson left his feet to hit an outside pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to hit that ball," Sharperson said. "I can't strike out. I've got no 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
It was as if none of the Dodgers felt they had much choice Sunday, as they 
played as if their elimination from the division race depended on it. But 
haven't they already felt eliminated? 
</P>
<P>
"Eleven games behind is a lot better than 13 games behind," said starter Orel 
Hershiser, who allowed two runs and eight hits in seven innings. "We get back 
from this road trip next week, we have their lead down to single digits, you 
never know. We could get really hot for one last month and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
At their current rate of progress, they would need about 25 wins in September 
to have a chance. It's an unlikely scenario, considering Sunday was only the 
sixth time they have won a game they trailed after seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
It's about as unlikely as Howell going four innings, three innings longer than 
his normal workday, and still pitching nearly perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he can be a starter," said Hershiser. "He can go four, he can surely 
go five, and that's all you need for a win." 
</P>
<P>
The long stint agreed with Howell (3-3). By allowing just four hits and no 
runners past second base, he picked up his first win since May 1. He has 
allowed one run since June 4, a span of 23 appearances. His earned-run average 
fell to 0.70. 
</P>
<P>
And his unavailability as a stopper meant Alejandro Pena was able to get his 
first real chance at a save since April 15, when he picked his second save of 
the season. He now has three, thanks to a perfect 12th inning in relief of 
Howell. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go nine, sure," said Howell, not specifying whether he meant nine 
innings or nine batters. 
</P>
<P>
As a possible hint, he ran across the field from the dugout to the clubhouse as 
soon as he finished his fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured, once I was in the clubhouse, I was out of the game, they couldn't 
put me back in," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, he only threw 41 pitches," protested pitching coach Ron Perranoski. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was only the second time in 24 starts that Orel Hershiser (14-8) has not 
received a decision. "That's because they don't pinch-hit for me in the seventh 
inning in a tie game," said Hershiser, one of the few National League pitchers 
with that distinction. . . . Hershiser said these final seven weeks of the 
season can mean more for the Dodgers than a revised place in the standings. 
"This can be something we can build on for next year," he said. "A lot of 
people still don't know what's going to happen to the roster. They don't know 
who's coming and who's going. (Management) still has a lot of decisions to 
make. How many outfielders do we have? Even if you filter out the young guys, 
you still have a ton of bodies. What happens to them?" Ten different current 
Dodgers have worked in their outfield this season. They need five. . . . The 
Giants were heartened by Sunday's performance of starter Kelly Downs, making 
his first appearance since May 1, when he went out with shoulder problems. 
Downs allowed one run and three hits in 6 2/3 innings. . . . Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda was criticized when he picked Willie Randolph as the National League 
All-Star reserve second baseman ahead of Houston's Bill Doran and San 
Francisco's Robby Thompson. Their numbers since the All-Star break: Randolph is 
hitting .258, Thompson is hitting .170, Doran is batting .102. . . . Fernando 
Valenzuela's two hits and runs batted in during Saturday's 5-1 win were no 
accident. Valenzuela is one of a couple of Dodger pitchers who takes early 
batting practice on the road.

NUNN'S CHALLENGE TONIGHT IS STREET FIGHTIN' MAN; 
</P>
<P>
IF HE CAN HANDLE BARKLEY, THE MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR MIDDLEWEIGHT FIGHTS AWAIT 
</P>

<P>
Tonight is the night that Michael Nunn is supposed to break away from the ranks 
of million-dollar middleweights and become a multi-million dollar man. Beat 
Iran Barkley tonight, Nunn is told, and he will crash the rich middleweight 
division's seniors tour featuring Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Roberto 
Duran. 
</P>
<P>
The oddsmakers suggest, with 9-to-1 to 11-to-1 odds favoring Nunn, that it is 
an easy assignment, but there is uneasiness in the Nunn camp. In Barkley 
(25-5), Nunn (33-0) faces one of boxing's enigmatic characters for whom no form 
chart can be assembled. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Nunn's smooth, classic style, Barkley is, plain and simple, a 
wild-swinging street fighter. Barkley fights like he is in a Dodge City saloon. 
"You feel more comfortable going in against a guy who has a certain style that 
you can plan for," said Joe Goossen, Nunn's trainer. "But this guy is a street 
fighter, a guy who's awkward, who does everything wrong, a guy who throws 
punches from all kinds of angles." 
</P>
<P>
Example: Barkley vs. Thomas Hearns, June 6, 1988. For 2 1/2 rounds, Hearns was 
beating up Barkley. He opened cuts over Barkley's eyes and seemed on the verge 
of a knockout. But Barkley caught Hearns on the chin with a desperation right 
and suddenly he was the World Boxing Council middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley later lost his title on an upset decision to Duran last February. But a 
Hearns-like upset tonight in the University of Nevada Reno's Lawlor Events 
Center would earn him Nunn's International Boxing Federation middleweight 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley has a way of creating sensational fights. His last three, the loss to 
Duran and knockout victories over Hearns and Michael Olajide, will be 
remembered for their violence. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, by the way, slimming down to 160 pounds for his Dec. 7 fight with 
Leonard, will appear in a four-round exhibition bout on the undercard. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Nunn's first fight since his 88-second, one-punch knockout of 
Sumbu Kalambay in Las Vegas in March. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's manager, Dan Goossen, hoped that a victory over Barkley would set up a 
Nunn-Hearns fight this fall, but now comes word that Hearns might take a fight 
with Olajide instead. 
</P>
<P>
"If Tommy Hearns feels he's no longer the best middleweight in the world, he 
should say so," Goossen said. "When you go to the Super Bowl, you get the two 
best teams, right? Why would Tommy fight Olajide? No one wants that. That's an 
ESPN fight." 
</P>
<P>
Manny Steward, Hearns' manager, says it's true that he has working on a Hearns- 
Olajide bout, but that a Hearns-Nunn matchup could follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Ray Leonard is ever going to fight Tommy again or Michael Nunn," 
Steward said. "Ray simply can't beat tall fighters, and he knows it. Tommy and 
I talked about it and when he asked me what was the most credible fight for him 
out there, I told him Hearns-Nunn, and he agrees with me. So we're tentatively 
looking at Nunn for next spring." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn will be facing a man tonight who is not only one of boxing's most 
dangerous fighters, but an angry one as well. It has to do with vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
At the pre-fight news conference, Barkely was sullen and reporters had to prod 
him to get him to say what was bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nunn) said bad stuff about me," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
"What did he say, Iran?" 
</P>
<P>
"He said I had the I.Q. of a onion and that I was ugly," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who grew up in the Bronx section of New York and was taught how to 
fight by his sister, Yvonne, will earn roughly $500,000 tonight (Nunn gets 
$1.25 million). John Reetz, Barkley's manager, says Barkley will be able to 
read the numbers on the check, but that's about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran knows he's going to have to greatly improve his reading and writing 
skills if he wants to go into any kind of business after he's through 
fighting," Reetz said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's talked about opening a restaurant when he's done with boxing, but I've 
made him understand he can't do that if he has to rely on other people to do 
his reading and writing for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Until he went into training for this fight, he was working with a tutor and 
he'll pick it up again afterward. He may get involved in the New York state 
literacy program and do some TV spots where his message to kids will be, 'Look 
at me, I make a million dollars boxing and I can't read.' " 
</P>
<P>
Barkley talked about his youth the other day, his life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough . . . people died. I got beat up so bad once I was in the 
hospital. There was a lot of pressure on young guys. I was getting pulled away 
from school, which is where I should have stayed." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley's older sister, who as "Yvonne the Killer" fought briefly as a pro, 
first taught her brother to box in a Bronx gym when he was 11. 
</P>
<P>
"She sparred with me until I was 18, when I got too strong for her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley's mentor for this fight is Ahmed Bey, onetime Army boxing champion who 
describes himself as a "retired gambler." 
</P>
<P>
"(Reetz) asked me to come into their team as a strategist for this fight," Bey 
said. "They felt I knew more about Nunn than anyone who was available to help 
them. The first thing I told Iran is that he's basically a street fighter and I 
told him not to change a thing. 
</P>
<P>
"See, if this fight were in an alley, Iran would be the 10-1 favorite, not 
Nunn. Nunn is going to learn that Iran has the heart of a lion, that he'll 
literally die trying to win. So we want a street fight. If it is, Nunn will get 
mugged." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley is a slow-footed banger. Nunn is extremely quick afoot and has fast 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley turned to Nunn at the news conference and said: "Let's make it a fight. 
Don't get on your bicycle, brother." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn turned to reporters and said: "He keeps talking about 'catching' me. But 
the question he must answer is, when he catches me, is he going to like it?"

MORNING BRIEFING: LASORDA ISN'T DONE IN BY TEAM'S TRYING TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Dodgers were gradually sinking out of sight in the National League 
West, an Eastern writer wondered if Tom Lasorda's troops were giving 100%. 
Lasorda considered the question academic. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying's not important." he said. "Truck drivers could try. If I brought truck 
drivers in, sat them down and told them I was going to pay them $800,000 a 
year, they'd try from 3 a.m. until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want tryers. I want doers. Try, hell. For $800,000 a year, I'd wrestle 
piranhas." 
</P>
<P>
Signals over: From New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, a former 
assistant football coach at Purdue and Northwestern: "When the bases are loaded 
and there's nobody out, you've got to bring the run in. It's like you're on the 
goal line and it's first and 10. You've got to get the ball in." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Montreal Expo coaches Jackie Moore and Steve Boros have in 
common? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
For the record: A reader, correcting a trivia item on World Series that matched 
batting champions, submitted the 1931 Series that matched Al Simmons of the 
Philadelphia Athletics and Chick Hafey of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Tough sell: From the Denver Post: "Is Ray Perkins' fame fading in Tampa? The 
Tampa Bay coach is looking for a radio station for his weekly talk show, but is 
finding no takers. Geez, all Ray wants is $5,000 a week for five three-minute 
morning spots and an hour-long weekend show." 
</P>
<P>
Senior senor: From Lee Trevino, vowing to abandon the regular tour to join the 
seniors when he turns 50 in December: "I was born at night, but it wasn't last 
night, believe me. There's no sense in playing the flat bellies when you can 
play the round bellies." 
</P>
<P>
Add seniors: Walter Zembriski, 54, a former construction worker who has won 
more than $600,000 on the Seniors tour, told the Sporting News of the dangers 
he faced as a steelworker: "I saw 10 guys fall to their deaths. I'd like to 
forget it." 
</P>
<P>
How-times-have-changed Dept.: From Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller: "I was a 
bonus baby. I got two autographed baseballs and a scorecard from the 1935 
All-Star game." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a switch: More often than not you hear famous people say, "If I had it 
to do over, I wouldn't change a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Not Red Grange. The Galloping Ghost, living in retirement in Florida, told Bob 
Dolgan of the Cleveland Plain Dealer: "If I had it to do over again, I'd 
probably live my whole life different. I'd work harder, make more money." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Both are former managers of the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Pittsburgh Steeler kicker Gary Anderson, on how he's been able to 
handle pressure from crowds: "I'm the son of a Baptist minister, so I've had 
people watching me all my life."

WINNERS FEEL AT END OF THEIR ROPES; 
</P>
<P>
BUT THE AGONY OF 62-MILE CATALINA SKI RACE IS WORTH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN LE BATARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kurt Schoen and Rose Johnson disguised their pain behind smiles. There is, they 
said, something about winning the world's most grueling ski race that helps 
hide the pain. 
</P>
<P>
With a time of 1 hour 47 seconds, Schoen won the 41st Catalina Ski Race Sunday, 
averaging more than 60 m.p.h. over the 62-mile course from Long Beach Harbor to 
Catalina Island and back. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson won the women's division for the third consecutive year with a time of 
1 hour 11 minutes 17 seconds, slow by usual standards but quite fast 
considering that she suffered a head-first spill halfway through the race. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a stampede-like start that showcased 98 colorful boats, Schoen 
provided the morning's most picturesque moment. As 2,000 helium-filled balloons 
were released and 5,000 standing spectators cheered, Schoen, his right fist 
piercing the air repeatedly, blurred through the finish line behind his boat, a 
38-foot streak of red power. 
</P>
<P>
"This is super, absolutely unbelievable," said Schoen, still breathing hard 10 
minutes after the race. "My body is kind of going through convulsions right 
now, but it's worth it. Coming through that last stretch of water all alone -- 
there's just no feeling like it." 
</P>
<P>
England's Steve Moore, water skiing's reigning world champion, finished second 
in 1 hour 1 minute 6 seconds, at least partially because his 20-foot boat 
didn't adapt well to the rough waters. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, meanwhile, thought she might not even finish the race, much less win 
it. She took a big early lead, but after losing her concentration and, 
subsequently, her balance, she wanted to quit. The 60 m.p.h, face-first fall 
knocked the wind out of her, but teammates quickly retrieved her ski and her 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"My face is so sore," said Johnson, who defeated Debbie Nordblad by 11 seconds. 
"At that point I wasn't thinking about winning -- I was thinking about 
breathing. The water just ripped my goggles off and slapped my face. I thought 
I would have to go in." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday belonged not only to Schoen and Johnson but also to those who finished 
much later, long after the crowd and the applause disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
There was Tamara Kahn of Oxnard, a 9-year-old who used a ski twice her size and 
often lost sight of her teammates -- her mom and dad -- because she couldn't 
see over the waves. 
</P>
<P>
With a time of 3 hours 9 minutes 3 seconds, Kahn finished last overall but 
first in her division -- there being nobody else in her division. After the 
race, she proudly pointed out that she fell only twice because of boat wake and 
three other times she released the rope because her back began hurting. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept giving her the option of quitting," said mom/navigator Connie Kahn, 
"but she kept saying that she wasn't finished. For a while, though, I thought 
she had had it." 
</P>
<P>
Tamara took up skiing when she was 3 and, although she had never skied even 
half as long as she did Sunday, she decided to join this race after seeing 
long-distance skiing on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"I had fun today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's race proved that skiers, much like the waves they travel on, come in 
all shapes and sizes. Bob Coffman finished the race in 2 hours 33 minutes 47 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad considering he's 67. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll try it again next year," he said, "if my wife lets me." 
</P>
<P>
Coffman, who also enjoys hang gliding, wind surfing and weightlifting, says he 
wasn't much of an athlete when he was younger. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you can say I'm peaking late," he said.

NEWSWIRE: COE NEARLY FALLS BUT RECOVERS TO WIN AS OVETT FINISHES NINTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sebastian Coe unleashed a dramatic kick after stumbling over a falling opponent 
to win his 1,500-meter showdown with Steve Ovett in the British Amateur 
Athletic Assn. Championships at Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
Coe recorded a time of 3 minutes 41.38 seconds to win the first race ever on a 
British track between the former Olympic champions and earned an automatic spot 
on England's team for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
With 500 meters left, Steve Crabb tripped and fell. Coe stumbled over Crabb and 
nearly fell, wincing and grabbing his left hamstring as he regained his 
balance. He fell to eighth place, 40 meters back, before coming on to win. 
</P>
<P>
Ovett managed to steer clear of Crabb but faded to finish ninth in 3:45.85.

THE SPEED KINGS OF BASEBALL: FELLER HAS THE EDGE ON RYAN AND KOUFAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time the smoke of another of those showcase gems by Nolan Ryan, the 
baffling Old Man of fastball pitchers, reaches Cleveland, Bob Feller feels a 
twinge. Perhaps it can be interpreted as a twinge of jealousy; it's a definite 
twinge. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and Sandy Koufax are Johnny-come-latelies. Walter Johnson's blaze of glory 
was in the dim age before mass communications. Feller was the Strikeout King of 
the early days when radio and then television told us about the romance of the 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Great hitters move their hands when they talk about the fastball the way 
fighter pilots describe the climb of an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"Feller was the best pitcher I ever saw," said Ralph Kiner, who flew a fighter, 
hit against Feller and broadcast Ryan. "He threw as hard as Ryan and had a 
better curve." 
</P>
<P>
Feller accepts compliments as comfortably as he accepts paid autograph 
sessions. He won 266 games from 1936 to 1956 and missed almost all of four 
seasons during World War II. He won 25 the year before he left and 26 the full 
year he returned, so he might have won another 80 or 100 games. By the time he 
was Ryan's age, 42, Feller had been retired four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Feller pitched three no-hitters and 12 one-hitters. Ryan has five no-hitters 
and 11 one-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan has us on longevity," Feller said. "My wife says his arm must have been 
built on a Wednesday. I still say Johnson must have been the fastest." 
</P>
<P>
It was Feller's generous tip of the cap to Johnson. Feller still owns the 
record for the fastest fastball in the semi-official clockings listed by the 
Hall of Fame. Ryan's best is 100.8 mph. Feller's was 107.9. He'll stand up to 
defend that mark. 
</P>
<P>
The strikeout records are subject to interpretation. When Ryan struck out 383 
in 1973, it was during the era of the designated hitter and he didn't get to 
throw to a single pitcher. But when Feller struck out 348 in 1946, a strikeout 
was still a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Velocity is an absolute. At 90 mph, a bit faster than the 87 mph of the average 
big-league fastball, the hitter has 0.42 seconds to get his bat on the ball. At 
107.9 mph, the hitter has 0.35 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Good hitters can handle the best fastball, if there is no other pitch to go 
with it, but the fastball is still the ultimate weapon. Consider that great 
fastball pitchers are tiny increments ahead of one another, and that the great 
Koufax was never timed faster than 93.2; the notion that Feller threw more than 
7 mph faster than Ryan is dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
That the gap between Ryan and any pitcher could be 7 mph invites some 
skepticism. Johnson and Smokey Joe Wood were measured against a speeding 
motorcycle; when do you start the clock and when do you stop it is the great 
variable. 
</P>
<P>
Feller was timed in 1946 on photo-electric devices the Army's Aberdeen Proving 
Grounds used to test weapons. Feller was known as Rapid Robert and Bullet Bob 
at the time. "It was as fair as the radar guns they use on Ryan and the others 
today," Feller said. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Griffith,'the penurious owner of the Washington Senators, advertised for 
a week that Feller would undergo a speed test before the game on Sunday. "He 
never told me," Feller recalled. He was getting stretched to warm up when 
Griffith informed him the equipment was ready. 
</P>
<P>
"I was being paid by the numbers of games I won and attendance at home, not by 
Griffith," Feller said. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
"If I won a game, I got $2,500," Feller recalled. "I told Griffith: 'You've 
been good for baseball and haven't made much money from it. You're going to 
make $25,000 from this. I'll do it for $700."' 
</P>
<P>
Griffith brought the check and Feller went to face the timing machine, which he 
recalls as a triangle about three feet on a side, mounted over the plate. 
</P>
<P>
From the mound, he said, he was timed at 98.6, which some lists include as 
Feller's mark, but that was terminal velocity, not the average speed of Ryan's 
mark. "I went right in front of the plate and threw through the triangle," 
Feller said. "It was 117.2 mph." That was muzzle velocity. 
</P>
<P>
"Add them and divide by 2 and you get 107.9," he said. "Then I went to 30 feet, 
3 inches and was timed at 107-plus. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I went out and pitched 13 innings to win, 2-1." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Johnson's 97 mph of 1914 was guesstimated against the motorcycle. Feller 
took one of those tests too, in 1940. "I gained 13 feet in 60 feet, 6 inches 
against a motorcycle going 86," Feller said. "That figures to 104 mph." 
</P>
<P>
He said Johnson must have been faster beaause of all the strikeouts he got in 
the time when hitters struck out very little, and the fact that Johnson didn't 
have a curveball. It is the curve or some other pitch that makes the really 
good fastball devastating. Ryan has a good curveball; Feller had a great one. 
</P>
<P>
"It would start off back here, behind your head, and it would break over the 
corner, low and outside," recalls Bob Lemon, who was in the Cleveland rotation 
with Feller. 
</P>
<P>
Movement of the ball is the distinction between being fast and having a good 
fastball. The best fastballs are risers, usually at the chest and climbing out 
of the strike zone. Rarely can a pitcher make a fastball at the knees rise. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Yastrzemski, with the tying run on third base in the 1978 playoff game 
against the New York Yankees, looked for a fastball down from Goose Gossage and 
got one. "It just exploded," Yastrzemski said. He popped it up for the final 
out. Gossage's clocking is 99.4. 
</P>
<P>
Kiner keeps in his pocket a list of the great fastballs. J.R. Richard was timed 
at 100 mph and Rob Dibble of the Cincinnati Reds recently became the only other 
man to reach 100. Kiner thinks Dwight Gooden, whom the Mets have at 98 mph, has 
lost some of the movement on his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls that Rex Barney was the fastest he ever saw, but Barney couldn't get 
it over the plate and there is no listed clocking of his fastball. There is 
none, either, for Steve Dalkowski, whose fastball is a wisp of smoke in 
minor-league memory. Legend says he may have been fastest of all. We'll never 
know. 
</P>
<P>
Feller didn't have the average of strikeouts per game Ryan and Gooden have 
because the game has changed. "Then there would be guys who said you weren't 
going to strike them out," Feller said. "There's no moral victory to it 
anymore. DiMaggio choked the bat two inches when I had two strikes on him." 
</P>
<P>
Joe DiMaggio hit 361 home runs and struck out only 369 times. "Today they don't 
give a damn if they strike out 150 times in a season," Feller said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no clocking for Sudden Sam McDowell, who was heir to Feller's crown in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
In the closing stages of the career that he later admitted he drank away, 
McDowell was on the Yankees when Ryan missed no-hitting them by inches. "Tell 
them," McDowell pleaded, "I used to throw like that."

EDDIE READ HANDICAP AT DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
FRANKEL DOUBLES HIS PLEASURE WHILE JOCKEY BLACK HAS NO FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For trainer Bobby Frankel, Sunday's Del Mar stakes doubleheader was a dream. 
For jockey Corey Black, it was a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel swept the $275,250 Eddie Read Handicap with Saratoga Passage and the 
$111,000 San Clemente Handicap with Darby's Daughter, two horses who are 
finally realizing their full potential. 
</P>
<P>
Black, on the other hand, had his hands full with the antics of the high-strung 
Seattle Meteor in the San Clemente (she beat one horse) and the front-running 
Halcyon Days in the Eddie Read. 
</P>
<P>
The Read was actually a double feature unto itself. Halcyon Days, an Irish colt 
who had won three consecutive races for trainer Eddie Gregson, was in a world 
of his own through the first seven furlongs of the 1 1/8-mile turf event. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking from the outside of the eight-horse field, Halcyon Days took off like 
his tail was on fire. He led by five lengths at the first call, at least eight 
at the half mile mark and perhaps even more than that at various points along 
the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in the pack, the other seven jockeys made their plans for the 
moment when Halcyon Days would run out of gas. Eddie Delahoussaye, aboard 
Saratoga Passage, had the best view, from last place. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to ride your own race, even when it comes up like this one," 
said Delahoussaye, who was winning the Read for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to ignore Corey's horse and just wait." 
</P>
<P>
And wait, and wait. Delahoussaye dawdled at the back until the field entered 
the final turn. To that point, Quiet Boy had been running second under Alex 
Solis, setting a more reasonable target for the stretch runners. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pretended Alex was on the lead," said Gary Stevens, who rode eventual 
runner-up Skip Out Front. 
</P>
<P>
Halcyon Days was still playing hard to get as the field straightened into the 
stretch. But then, with a furlong to run, it was open season on the exhausted 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens and Skip Out Front were first to burst out of the pack. Delahoussaye, 
after threading his way between horses, came flying on the outside, then 
Pasakos and Robbie Davis put in a run on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
In the final 50 yards, the long-striding Saratoga Passage pulled clear to win 
by 2 1/4 lengths. Skip Out Front, who had finished third and fourth in previous 
runnings of the Read, was second by a half-length over Pasakos. Halcyon Days 
finished fourth, beaten less than three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"He was his own worst enemy," said Black. "I tried everything to get him to 
relax, keeping him on a loose rein." 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Black took a fair amount of ribbing for ride, especially from 
his cubicle mate and mentor, Fernando Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you complaining about, jock?" said Toro, who finished sixth on Mister 
Wonderful II. "You couldn't have had a better trip!" 
</P>
<P>
Saratoga Passage, a 4-year-old Washington-bred son of Pirateer, is now two for 
two on the turf and getting better with every start. 
</P>
<P>
The gangly chestnut was the Washington Horse of the Year in 1987, when he 
invaded Southern California to win the Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita. His 
owners, a group of Seattle racing fans and breeders that call themselves the 
Saratoga I Stable, had their sights set on the 1988 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
But the progress of Saratoga Passage was halted by a lung infection in March of 
1988, and then, when he tried to come back last summer, he suffered a broken 
cannon bone. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel took over the training of Saratoga Passage late last year and won with 
him first time out in February. He placed in two Santa Anita stakes, finished 
sixth to Blushing John in the Pimlico Special, then was well beaten in the 
Californian on June 4 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have put him on the turf a long time ago," said Frankel, who won past 
Reads with No Turning, Wickerr (twice) and Al Mamoon. 
</P>
<P>
"But maybe it's for the best. We haven't used him up and we've got a terrific 
grass horse." 
</P>
<P>
Saratoga Passage was timed in 1:49 and paid $12.80 as the fourth choice. Silver 
Circus, the mild favorite, raced in fourth early and faded to last. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Clemente Handicap, Darby's Daughter finally made good on her promise 
of last season with a three-quarter-length victory over Sticky Wile. 
</P>
<P>
Last year as a 2-year-old, the Texas-bred the daughter of Darby Creek Road was 
among the best in the East. She won four of seven races, and even threw a scare 
into Open Mind in the Demoiselle Stakes last November in New York, coming 
within a neck of the upset. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Open Mind was fresh from her win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies. Since then she has gone on to even greater glory, running her winning 
streak to 10 races, including Saturday's Alabama Stakes at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
Darby's Daughter, on the other hand, virtually disappeared this year. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, owner James Cottrell sent her to Charlie Whittingham at 
Santa Anita, but she never ran. A few months later the bay filly went over to 
Frankel when his client, Edmund Gann of San Diego, bought her from Cottrell. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente was Darby's Daughter's third start for Frankel after two 
losses at Hollywood Park. Gann also had his California Oaks winner General 
Charge in the race, and the entry went off the 7-2 third choice. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Tapping Tudor set the early pace, while Sticky Wile and A 
Thrilling Moment stayed close. Gary Stevens had Darby's Daughter in fourth, 
only a few lengths off the lead after a half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
Approaching the far turn, Chris McCarron sent favored Reluctant Guest alongside 
Darby's Daughter. Stevens could have been trapped behind the tiring leaders, 
but suddenly Reluctant Guest dropped the bit and backed off. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris had me cold," Stevens said later. "If his filly hadn't stopped, I'd have 
had to wait to make my move." 
</P>
<P>
While McCarron eased up on Reluctant Guest (she bled), Darby's Daughter spurted 
through the final furlong to run down Sticky Wile. Bel Darling, at 24-1, popped 
through heavy traffic to finish fast for third. 
</P>
<P>
Darby's Daughter was clocked in 1:36 3/5 for the mile on firm turf, and the 
entry returned $9. The $5 exacta was worth $184. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel confirmed that Darby's Daughter would run next in the $150,000 Del Mar 
Oaks on Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Sunday Silence had to miss a few days' 
training because of a minor cough. As a result, he will probably be running in 
the Sept. 24 Super Derby at Louisiana Downs instead of the Molson Challenge On 
Sept. 10 at Woodbine. . . . After going down in consecutive races last Friday, 
Fernando Valenzuela did not ride Sunday and will not ride today. He received a 
gash on his head and is complaining of body sorenes. . . . Corey Black bounced 
back after falling at the start of Sunday's fourth race to win the sixth on 
Great Event for Del Mar president John Mabee. Great Event paid $98. . . . Del 
Mar's business is booming, both on-track and off-track. Overall attendance is 
up 4.4% and betting handle is up 10.6% over last year's figures. . . . 
California-based Present Value continues to barnstorm across America. After 
winning stakes in Detroit and Chicago, the Jerry Fanning-trained runner took 
Sunday's $150,000 Canterbury Cup in Shakopee, Minn. Frank Olivares was aboard. 
. . . While Jeff Lukas sent out Steinlen to win the Bernard Baruch Handicap on 
Sunday at Saratoga, father Wayne Lukas was at Del Mar to enjoy the maiden win 
of the 2-year-old Majestic Light filly Patches for W.T. Young. . . . Analyzing 
Great Communicator's fourth-place finish in Saturday's Arlington Handicap, 
jockey Ray Sibille was still positive about his chances in the Arlington 
Million Sept. 3. "He ran good to the eighth pole and just did get beat for 
third," Sibille said. "He got beat about five lengths, but he'll be dead fit 
for the Million now."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
METS FINALLY BACKING WORDS WITH VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Several times this season, the New York Mets have indicated they were ready to 
take command of the East. 
</P>
<P>
Each time they fell back, seemingly content to let the Chicago Cubs and 
Montreal Expos dominate the division. 
</P>
<P>
It now appears the Mets are ready to prove what they have been saying all along 
-- that they are the class of the league. 
</P>
<P>
During the weekend, the Mets didn't merely put a deep dent in the hopes of the 
St. Louis Cardinals, they served notice they are beginning to live up to 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ojeda, in winning his fourth in a row, made it into the eighth inning 
Sunday at New York and the Mets outlasted the Cardinals, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
In winning four of the five against their bitter division rival, the Mets moved 
to within 3 1/2 games of the first place Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who barely missed pulling out victories in the last two games, 
are 6 1/2 back. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded in the eighth inning and St. Louis trailing by a run, the 
Cardinals' Jose Oquendo hit a slow roller off Randy Myers toward second. Tim 
Teufel, not noted for stellar defensive play, made a barehanded pickup and his 
throw barely beat Oquendo. If Oquendo, a switch-hitter, had been batting from 
the left side, he probably would have beaten it out and tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
Ojeda (9-9) has a 1.88 earned-run average in his last six starts, while the 
staff in its last 14 games has a 1.74 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets are 40-19 at Shea Stadium but 10 games below .500 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' Vince Coleman stole two bases and is now 52 for 52 against the 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson, the Mets' offensive leader, sat out the second game in a row 
because of a bruised shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, Chicago 3 -- The Cubs' strategy was to pitch around Von Hayes 
and John Kruk in this game at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But Ricky Jordan foiled the best laid plans of Manager Don Zimmer. Jordan 
tripled in two runs in the first inning, then hit a sacrifice fly to break a 
tie in the eighth inning and give the Phillies a split in the four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I see the ball better and I'm more confident," said Jordan, who has driven 
in 14 runs in the last 15 games. "Earlier it frustrated me when they pitched 
around the other guys to get to me." 
</P>
<P>
One Cub streak ended. Ryne Sandberg, after resting a game, went 0 for 3 after 
hitting home runs in five consecutive games. But Jerome Walton doubled in the 
fifth inning to extend his hitting streak to 24 games, longest in the majors 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Walton crashed into the left-field fence in the sixth inning trying to catch 
Hayes' deep drive, which went for an inside-the-park home run. Walton suffered 
a bruised shoulder and left after one more inning. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, Houston 0 -- The way he pitches against the Astros, left-hander 
Tom Browning looks as good as any pitcher in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up six hits and walked five at Houston, Browning breezed to 
his eighth victory in a row over the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
In his previous game against the Astros, the Reds scored 14 runs in the first 
inning for Browning and won, 18-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some good breaks," Browning said. "It is much easier to pitch when 
you have some runs to work with. The Astros are an aggressive team and I won't 
give them the same pitch in the same spot twice." 
</P>
<P>
The Astros, who have lost four of their last five and eight out of 11, missed a 
chance to gain ground on the San Francisco Giants in the West. They remained 
three games behind. 
</P>
<P>
Browning has won 23 of his last 26 decisions against teams in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, Montreal 4 -- Bob Walk, with last-inning help from Bill Landrum 
at Montreal, improved to 10-7 and ended the Pirates' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates' Andy Van Slyke and Bobby Bonilla hit consecutive home runs in the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual Perez (6-12), mostly a disappointment this season, lost for the third 
time in the last four games. He gave up seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. DAN HAFNER

ROOKIE JOHNSON, 29, AGAIN PROVES VALUABLE FOR ORIOLE STAFF, 6-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles have found a surprise stopper. He is Dave Johnson, a 
29-year-old rookie right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson got his second consecutive complete game victory Sunday as Baltimore 
beat the Boston Red Sox, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Worthington hit a two-run home run and Johnson pitched a six-hitter as 
the Orioles increased their lead in the East to 2 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The performance gave a lift to a struggling team that had used up its pitching 
staff in a 13-inning loss to the Red Sox 13 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
As their lead in the East faded, the Orioles brought Johnson up from Rochester 
and started him Aug. 1 at Boston. Although he had impressive minor league 
statistics, his only previous chance in the majors came with Pittsburgh in 
1987. He pitched 6 1/3 innings of relief, all in games already out of hand, and 
had an earned-run average of 9.95 before being shipped back to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was shelled in his debut. But when the Orioles gave him another chance 
at home against Minnesota last Tuesday, he went the distance for a 6-1 victory, 
giving the bullpen a needed rest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time we needed a complete game," pitching coach Al Jackson said. 
"We used seven pitchers last night. He saved us." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a Baltimore native, pitched at Memorial Stadium in a high school 
all-star game when he was 18. He and his wife live in a trailer park in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, when I return to Baltimore, I get a job driving a truck until 
spring," Johnson said. "Now I go to work at the ball park. My wife and I look 
at each other two or three times a day, and its like we don't realize what's 
happening. Nothing could be better than this." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Manager Joe Morgan, who used to drive a snowplow in the off-season, was 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a great job," he said. "He had a lot of stamina. It looked like he was 
out of gas a couple of times, but he kept going." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox split the four-game series. Wade Boggs, their best hitter, went 
three for 20. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, Cleveland 4 -- Among the teams in a position to challenge the 
Orioles in the East, the Brewers have shown the most signs that they are 
capable of making a run. 
</P>
<P>
Although the usually reliable Dan Plesac failed to hold a lead in the ninth at 
Cleveland, the Brewers came back to win in the 10th on a sacrifice fly by Robin 
Yount. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth victory in the last six games for the Brewers, putting them in 
a three-way tie for second with Toronto and Boston, 2 1/2 games behind. 
</P>
<P>
Plesac, who had saved 14 games in a row, was upset when two singles and a 
sacrifice fly by Brad Komminsk tied the score in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 8, Toronto 3 -- Royals Jose Tartabull and Bo Jackson hit home runs 
at Kansas City, but the go-ahead run came when Brad Wellman scored on a wild 
pitch in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Tom Gordon pitched a strong seven innings and when the Royals scored 
four times in the seventh, his record improved to 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, Minnesota 7 -- About the time it appears the Yankees are done, they 
manage to stay alive in the East. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed, 7-3, going into the eighth inning at Minneapolis. But Steve Sax 
singled to start a four-run rally that tied the score, then walked to begin a 
ninth-inning uprising that won it. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Jesse Barfield singled in two runs in the eighth and doubled home 
two in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 6, Seattle 4 -- Carlton Fisk drove in four runs at Seattle and hit the 
White Sox's first home run this month. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk hit a three-run homer in the fourth, but it was Ozzie Guillen's single in 
the eighth that broke a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Rangers 2 -- Lou Whitaker's tie-breaking two-run single with two out 
in the ninth inning gave the Tigers a win over the Rangers in Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, Mike Brumley singled off reliever Kenny Rogers, 2-2, who was 
replaced by Texas relief ace Jeff Russell. However, Brumley stole second and 
Russell walked Gary Pettis and hit Dave Bergman with a pitch to load the bases. 
Whitaker singled to center on a 1-2 pitch. DAN HAFNER

WALLACE COMES FROM FAR BACK, BUT HE WINDS UP BARELY IN FRONT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rusty Wallace just kept coming back until he found himself in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, far behind twice, held the lead over the last 14 laps to win the 
Budweiser at the Glen NASCAR race Sunday at Watkins Glen, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"We came from behind so many times, it was really kind of amazing," Wallace 
said. "I got caught on a caution flag and had a flat tire. We just had trouble 
all day long, but we were able to overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, when Wallace came on strong at the end of the season to finish 
second to Winston Cup champion Bill Elliott, his trademark was falling a lap or 
two off the pace and coming back to win. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he never lost a lap on the 2.48-mile, seven-turn Watkins Glen 
International road course, but did come from the back of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can pick up where we left off last year and win four or five in a 
row," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, who won $56,400 after averaging 89.242 m.p.h., crossed the finish line 
1.06 seconds ahead of Mark Martin, with Dale Earnhardt, Davey Allison, Bobby 
Hillin Jr. and Morgan Shepherd following. 
</P>
<P>
Martin jumped past Darrell Waltrip into second place, 126 points behind 
Earnhardt in the Winston Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
Driving what he called perhaps the best race of his career, Nigel Mansell of 
England swept to victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix at Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Briton's second win this season in his Ferrari. He started the year 
by winning the Brazilian Grand Prix in March. Mansell finished the 77-lap race 
in 1 hour 49 minutes 38.650 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it easy for the first 20-30 laps," Mansell said. "I looked after the 
tires, and I was able to finish the race without a pit-stop. It was a risk, but 
it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Ayrton Senna of Brazil, in his McLaren Honda, was second, followed by Thierry 
Boutsen of Belgium, in a Williams Renault. Senna, defending world champion, 
trails teammate Alain Prost of France by 14 points in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Brabham won the Camel Grand Prix of the Heartland at Topeka, Kan., to 
claim his eighth victory this season in the Camel GT series. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham has won five of the last six series races, the streak broken in 
Portland, Ore., two weeks ago when a checkered flag was waved early. The 
results of that race have been appealed to the International Motor Sports Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham's average speed was 94.5 m.p.h. for the 75-lap race on the 2.5-mile 
track. He came in 23 seconds ahead of teammate Chip Robinson of Oldwick, N.J. 
In third place was Price Cobb of Evergreen, Colo., who drove a Jaguar XJR-9. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Lawson showed he will not give up his crown without a fight when he won 
the Swedish 500cc Grand Prix to take the world championship lead from fellow 
American Wayne Rainey at Anderstorp, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Rainey crashed two laps from the finish when the rear wheel of his Yamaha slid 
under him as he tried to pass Lawson's Honda and take over the lead coming out 
of a bend. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson started the race 6 1/2 points behind but his fourth win in Sweden gave 
the triple world champion a 13 1/2-point lead with two races left. 
</P>
<P>
With Rainey out of the way, Frenchman Christian Sarron finished second on a 
Yamaha ahead of Lawson's Honda teammate, former world champion Wayne Gardner of 
Australia.

Among the newcomers expected to report to UCLA today for a week of conditioning 
before the official start of fall football practice next Monday are Mike 
Chalenski and Michael Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Chalenski, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound defensive end, is a transfer from Pitt, where 
he was a part-time starter last season as a freshman; Moore, a wide receiver, 
is a freshman from Beverly Hills High who was a second-round pick of the 
Toronto Blue Jays last June in the major league baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, Chalenski hoped to transfer to Miami until Pitt 
officials told him they would not release him to a school on the Panthers' 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But Chalenski, expected to be a standout at Pitt, denied the reports. He said 
the only reason he chose Pitt over UCLA out of high school was because Los 
Angeles was so far from his home in Kenilworth, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference now? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm older, more mature," said Chalenski, who will sit out this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a three-sport start at Beverly Hills, said that he and the Blue Jays 
never came close to reaching an agreement on contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to play (professional) baseball," he said, "but going to UCLA is by 
no means secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a center fielder, hopes to play baseball at UCLA. JERRY CROWE

IN BRIEF: OZONE CLEANUP DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a termite mound in the remote Boola Boola Forest of Australia, scientists 
have found a hint that a natural process may be working slowly to remove 
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from the atmosphere. If the hint 
turns out to be correct, it could mean that CFCs in the atmosphere could be 
reduced eventually. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by researchers at the Oregon Graduate Center's Institute 
of Atmospheric Sciences, who measured methane emissions from termite mounds in 
Australia, comparing the composition of air inside the mound with air outside. 
Among the chemicals they measured were CFCs. CFC levels inside the termite 
caverns, separated by 10 inches of soil from the air outside, were 
significantly lower than outside. Oregon researcher M. Aslam Khalil speculated 
that something in the soil must be removing CFCs from the air as it filters 
through the walls to fill the mounds, either breaking down CFCs or trapping 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Khalil believes there is an unknown chemical breakdown process at work. If the 
chemical could be identified, scientists might be able to use it to break down 
CFCs before they can reach the atmosphere, the researchers speculated.

MAYAS' DEMISE: A WAR WITHIN?; 
</P>
<P>
SITE REVEALS HEAVY FORTIFICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mystery of the Maya demise has haunted anthropologists for centuries, but 
researchers may be on the verge of solving the sudden disappearance of one of 
history's most advanced civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
The Maya were "the most sophisticated, literate, complex people in the New 
World," according to anthropologist Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University. 
They erected massive pyramids, created a highly accurate calendar, perfected 
the art of astronomical observation, produced beautiful multicolored pottery 
and intricately carved stone monuments and established widespread trade routes. 
</P>
<P>
But after flourishing throughout much of Central America from the 3rd to the 
8th Century, they all but disappeared in the 9th Century, dispersing into small 
villages and seemingly losing most of their talents. 
</P>
<P>
Historians and archeologists have long pondered the reasons for this downfall, 
arguing at different times that losses of trade routes, changes in climate, 
endemic disease and many other related factors contributed to their downfall. 
In the past, most of the theories shared the premise that the Mayas were 
largely a peace-loving people who engaged in limited warfare only for 
ritualistic purposes and who met their demise through little fault of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
But new discoveries made this summer in the lowlands of Guatemala by a team 
headed by Demarest present a sharply different picture of the end of the Maya 
era. Demarest has discovered a heavily fortified Mayan city, called Punta de 
Chimino, that is "more massive than a medieval castle" in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearby city of Dos Pilas, he has found hastily erected stoneworks that 
suggest that the city was under heavy siege. These new discoveries, combined 
with previous excavations in the area, indicate that, at the height of the 
Mayan hegemony, the Mayan people were involved in ferocious internecine warfare 
that sapped their vitality and tore apart the fabric of their civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have few clues yet about what caused the sudden escalation of 
warfare that brought about the end of Mayan civilization -- although some 
evidence suggests the haunting possibility that it was triggered by 
over-exploitation of the environment, deterioration of the soil and pressure on 
food resources. 
</P>
<P>
But even though they do not know why the warfare started, the scientists 
believe they know who started it. Stelae (stone pillars with intricate 
carvings) from Dos Pilas identify a leader, known only as Ruler 2 because 
archeologists have not had time to translate his name, "who appears to be one 
of the kings from the beginning of the 8th Century who embarked on a program of 
territorial conquest," Demarest said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on many recent discoveries of evidence of warfare, especially this 
summer's, Demarest has concluded that, for a period of perhaps 50 to 60 years 
beginning about AD 825, warfare spread like a contagion throughout the region. 
Eventually, the economic system collapsed under the weight of the strain 
imposed by the intense combat and defensive measures and individual states 
within the area fell "like dominoes." 
</P>
<P>
By far the most important discovery made this summer is the Punta de Chimino 
site, which sits on a peninsula that juts into Lake Petexbatun in northwestern 
Guatemala, four days' journey from Guatemala City by plane, Jeep, canoe and 
mule. Researchers had known that a village existed on the site but had not 
explored it. 
</P>
<P>
"We went there to do a survey for a week," Demarest said by telephone from 
Antigua, Guatemala, where he has been recuperating from pneumonia and the 
parasitic diseases that are the bane of archeologists. The 36-year-old Demarest 
is the leader of a team of several American and Guatemalan archeologists, a 
dozen Vanderbilt graduate students and 50 Guatemalan workers that has been 
granted an exclusive permit by the Guatemalan government to dig up hundreds of 
square miles of the Mayan heartland in the Peten jungle. The $1-million project 
is funded by the National Geographic Society, the H. F. Guggenheim Peace 
Foundation and the largest archeological grant ever awarded by the National 
Endowment for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
Punta de Chimino "was not a very important component of our work," Demarest 
said. But what they found there made them change their plans instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayas who lived in Punta de Chimino excavated a massive ditch, 450 feet 
long and 50 feet deep, that cut the city off from the mainland, making it 
completely surrounded by water. In excavating the ditch through bedrock, 
Demarest said, the Mayas moved three times as much rock and stone as had been 
used to construct the city itself. "It's as if the United States were spending 
75% of its budget on defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Punta de Chimino also had walls around its sides to protect it from attacks by 
canoes, and protected portages through which food could be brought in during a 
siege. "One of the reasons people have used to argue that Mayans were not 
warlike was the fact that their centers were completely indefensible," he said. 
"This is the exact opposite of that." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the walls of Punta de Chimino, Demarest found "a kind of shrunken Mayan 
state. It has all the characteristics of a Mayan ceremonial center, but on a 
smaller scale." Included were a single ball court (the Mayas played a sort of 
hybrid between soccer and basketball with great intensity; losers were 
sometimes sacrificed), one temple, one funerary, one set of stairways with 
hieroglyphics, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The fortress also had a large open area within the innermost wall that could 
have been used as a refuge for the population from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been almost impossible to take the place. It was really 
impregnable," Demarest said. "Those are terms you don't normally use in 
discussing Mayan architecture." 
</P>
<P>
Punta de Chimino is "probably one of the few sites where the stereotype of 
archeology is accurate," he said. "It's like Indiana Jones and the Temple of 
Doom." 
</P>
<P>
At nearby Dos Pilas, evidence of a different kind also suggests a sudden 
intensification of warfare. Dos Pilas is the classic, indefensible Mayan city, 
in the middle of the jungle with ready access from all sides. But sometime 
toward the end of the 8th Century, the inhabitants of Dos Pilas erected two 
concentric rings of walls around the center of the city, defacing monuments and 
burying important artifacts in their haste. 
</P>
<P>
Debris recovered from inside the walls indicates that large numbers of people 
inhabited the area at least briefly, suggesting that the city was under siege. 
When and how it fell, however, is still a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
But before it did, Ruler 2 apparently conquered a number of smaller fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest and his colleagues also discovered, but have only tentatively 
explored, an extensive series of caves near Dos Pilas that have not been 
entered by humans for more than 1,000 years. He believes that the caves may 
also have been used as a place of refuge during a siege. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the caves, they discovered ritual offerings of broken pots and flint 
knives, as well as the mummified remains of a boy who had been sacrificed and 
painted with red ocher. Exploring the unexpected caves "was one of the first 
times I've found myself irrationally exhilarated," Demarest said. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest's discoveries are so recent that few of his colleagues, aside from 
those on the expedition itself, are aware of them. One who has been informed is 
anthropologist Richard E. W. Adams of the University of Texas at San Antonio, 
who thinks Demarest's discoveries are "swell stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The new discoveries, Adams said, "go a long way toward documenting in detail 
this whole business of warfare as an element in the collapse of the Mayan 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists' picture of the Mayan civilization has been gradually changing 
over the last 20 years. Historians of Mayan art, in particular, had begun to 
paint a picture of a more warlike population than had been previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan hieroglyphics show repeated images of warriors clad in jaguar pelts or 
bird-like costumes, bearing woven shields and lances, capturing the noble elite 
of nearby tribes and bringing them back to their own temples for ritualistic 
bloodletting, removal of their hearts and decapitation. 
</P>
<P>
But this war was sharply circumscribed. Mayan art shows no instances of cities 
under siege, temples ransacked, or any of the other depredations of large-scale 
conflict. Instead, the fighting seems to be representative more of a rite of 
passage for prestige than an actual combat for resources or plunder. 
</P>
<P>
But about AD 825, Adams said, "something went terribly wrong" and kings like 
Ruler 2 began actual conquest of nearby cities and settlements. By the middle 
of that century, Dos Pilas had extended its hegemony to cover an area of nearly 
690 square miles -- a huge amount of land in comparison to the areas controlled 
by other Mayan cities -- before it ultimately collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"But if one group changes the rules (of warfare), other groups have to adopt 
the new rules and you get a kind of arms race," Demarest said. "Intensification 
of warfare spreads by contagion, and the ultimate result can be regional 
devastation. In this case, the Dos Pilas hegemony broke up into heavily 
fortified sites, small independent states warring rather savagely with each 
other. It may not be the principal cause of the collapse of the Mayan 
civilization, but it is certainly a principal cause."

Two studies released last week document the dangers of pregnant women using 
cocaine and smoking cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Women who use cocaine early in their pregnancies are nearly five times more 
likely to produce babies with serious birth defects, government researchers 
reported in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. In a first-of-a-kind 
study, researchers found that pregnant women who used cocaine had a much 
greater chance of giving birth to babies with deformities in their kidneys or 
other parts of their urinary tracts. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that cocaine use during pregnancy may decrease the amount 
of oxygen getting to the developing fetus, causing malformations in the 
development of certain organs, such as the kidney, said Dr. Gilberto Chavez, an 
epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta who 
conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
A Swedish study reported that women who smoke during pregnancy increase the 
risk of a late miscarriage by 40% and double the chance that their child may 
suffer crib death. The study, published in the Swedish Medical Assn.'s journal, 
was based on all 300,000 births in Sweden between 1983 and 1985.

IN BRIEF: VIRUS FINDING SHAKES THEORY

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists reported last week that the concentration of viruses in a German 
lake may be up to 10 million times greater than previously thought, a finding 
that shakes existing views on dynamics of underwater life. Norwegian 
researchers detected 1.25 billion viruses in about a teaspoonful of water from 
a West German lake -- a level 1,000 to 10 million times greater than prior 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The microscopic viruses are a type that preys on bacteria and is not known to 
infect animals or humans. They are the smallest living particles yet to be 
found in river, lake or seawater. The University of Bergen's Gunnar Bratbak and 
his colleagues said it had generally been assumed that relatively few viruses 
inhabit natural, unpolluted water. 
</P>
<P>
But in a study published in the British journal Nature, Bratbak's team said its 
examination of water with an electron microscope found otherwise. At levels 
found in Germany's Lake Plussee in May, 1988, researchers said viruses could 
play a key role in keeping bacteria populations in check.

FOOTNOTES: HOTEL WITH RIVETING VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Checkers Hotel in downtown Los Angeles hoped that guests would enjoy 
the grassy lawn of the neighboring Los Angeles Central Library. But instead of 
gazing at parkland, guests on the hotel's north side now look at a construction 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Checkers, where penthouse suites fetch $975 a night, opened just a few months 
after the library began a large construction and renovation program. The 
project should take at least three years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been that bad," said Checkers spokeswoman Helen Chaplin, who adds 
that so far only one guest has asked to be relocated to the "quiet side" of the 
hotel. But "when they start the riveting," she said, "that might be another 
story." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Yellow Pages 
</P>
<P>
Greg Klark found himself driving along Melrose looking for a restaurant whose 
name escaped him and wishing that he had a pocket-sized phone book in his glove 
compartment to consult. Then, he said, it dawned on him that such a directory 
was an idea waiting to be hatched -- "a tool for the customer on the move." 
</P>
<P>
Result: California's first Yellow Pages directory designed for motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Klark's Inglewood-based Mobile Telephone Directories -- with about 70% of the 
ad space sold and some categories sold out -- expects to begin distribution by 
fall to 100,000 customers of PacTel Cellular in Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The directory offers advertisers what Klark called "a targeted market of people 
who are relatively affluent, are consumers on the move -- and have their 
wallets in their pocket." On the horizon, no doubt, is a category for pizza 
parlors that'll deliver to off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
High-Priced Dreams 
</P>
<P>
Here's one to sleep on. 
</P>
<P>
A local art gallery is selling "sculptured" bunk beds for children -- at 
$17,500 each. Saxon-Lee Gallery has 15 limited-edition beds -- which look like 
double-decker fire engines -- designed by New York artist Red Grooms for Fun 
Furniture of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Each includes sculptures of a Dalmation dog, two card-playing firefighters and 
two more firefighters hanging from the rear of the bed. The beds, of course, 
are fire engine red. "These are not just functional beds," said Daniel Saxon, 
co-owner of the gallery. "They're sculptures." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, three of the beds sold the first weekend that they were put on display, 
Saxon said. All three were bought by people in the film business -- two 
directors and one producer. 
</P>
<P>
But this is clearly no fire sale. After the first five are sold, the price of 
the remaining 10 beds will increase to $25,000 each. "The fewer there are 
available," Saxon said, "the more valuable they become." 
</P>
<P>
Moving Up and Moving Out 
</P>
<P>
Glitzy Fox Plaza in Century City won't be Airline Takeover Headquarters much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
Financier Alfred A. Checchi, who recently outbid Fox Plaza neighbor Marvin 
Davis for Northwest Airlines, is moving his investment firm to roomier digs in 
a West Los Angeles high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said he had no problems with his neighbors at Fox Plaza -- despite a 
lively bidding war with Davis for the Eagan, Minn.-based airline. It's just 
that Checchi's growing investment company needs more space -- the new office is 
three times bigger. 
</P>
<P>
Fox Plaza hasn't dropped entirely from the takeover scene. Davis, the 
billionaire oilman, is trying to buy United Airlines.

S. KOREA'S EXPORT-ORIENTED FIRMS ARE TARGETING A NEWLY AFFLUENT DOMESTIC MARKET 
THAT'S NOW THE KEY PROP IN THE NATION'S ECONOMY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until this year, Namil Metal Co. sold all $38 million of its stainless steel 
cookware overseas, 40% of it in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But now Namil is gearing up to enter the fastest-growing market in sight: the 
one at home. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the firm launched its first sales program in South Korea -- with an 
electric coffee percolator and a stainless steel toaster that does not get hot 
on the outside. In November, it will start marketing its pots and pans here. 
</P>
<P>
"Korean wives won't buy one pot or pan. They want a whole set," said Cho Gyu 
Gon, the firm's export manager. "A five- or 10-piece set costs between $150 and 
$300," and, until recently, most Korean housewives could not afford such a 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
But now that families with annual incomes of around $18,000 are becoming more 
common in South Korea, Namil feels that a market for its products has developed 
at home. By 1993, Cho said, the firm expects to sell $40 million in products -- 
about 40% of its projected sales -- in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
However, the country as a whole is undergoing a transformation even faster than 
the one that Namil plans. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for the first time since South Korea began to shake off the yoke of 
grinding poverty in the mid-1960s, demand at home will replace exports as the 
major prop of economic growth. And this historical transformation promises to 
be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Wage increases of more than 60% since late 1987, labor disruptions and the 
increased value of the won currency have spurred a major and sudden decline in 
the growth of exports. Cries of alarm have arisen from government and business. 
But also emerging, virtually unnoticed, is a new picture of the nation's 42 
million people -- not as mouths to feed but as consumers armed with soaring 
buying power. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand will support 85% of the growth in the gross national product 
this year -- a complete reversal of the past -- said Ro Sung Tae, director of 
research coordination at the government-funded Korea Development Institute. 
Between 1981 and 1988, increases in exports provided 75% to 80% of growth, 
according to the Bank of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Even with an expected recovery in exports, demand at home will support about 
65% of GNP growth next year and will continue to provide more than 50% of 
growth into the future, Ro added. 
</P>
<P>
"The days when you could look at the Korean trade balance and tell whether the 
Korean economy was doing well or not are over," said a Western diplomat, who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
In an annual white paper on trade, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry declared that South Korea -- and Taiwan, as well -- were 
"restructuring" to become "domestic-driven" economies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Better Products 
</P>
<P>
Already, the United States is reaping gains from the change. Aided partly by 
South Korean government efforts to divert sourcing of machinery from Japan to 
the United States, U.S. exports to this country soared 46% last year and are 
increasing by more than 20% this year. By comparison, from 1982 to 1986, U.S. 
sales to South Korea never grew by more than 9.6% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Richer Korean consumers are buying upgrade food and beverage products -- like 
fruit, beef, almonds and wine -- as Seoul carries out pledges to gradually open 
its agricultural markets. Imported furniture, too, has suddenly become a hit 
product. 
</P>
<P>
Service industries, such as advertising, banking and insurance -- in which the 
United States is interested -- are also growing. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of change are emerging everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic car sales are expected to increase by at least 40% this year -- and, 
if auto makers can produce the vehicles, demand could rise by as much as 60%. 
With its sales in the United States down sharply this year, Hyundai Motors, the 
top exporter, expects to sell more cars at home than abroad for the first time 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Air conditioners, color television sets, refrigerators and washing machines are 
so much in demand in South Korea that electronics firms have stopped offering 
discounts and, instead, have raised prices by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Construction contracts, in terms of floor space planned in new buildings, are 
up 36.8%. Hyundai Construction &amp; Engineering Co., which only a few years 
got 90% of its orders overseas, is now conducting 70% of its business at home, 
said Chung Hoon Mok, the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
So strong is the domestic construction boom that the government has started 
curtailing exports of steel bars, cement and glass to keep projects running. 
</P>
<P>
Household consumption of electricity is rising by 18.5% compared to last year, 
dwarfing a 1.9% increase in factory consumption of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, not only had the number of South Koreans 
traveling overseas soared 74% but spending by each had also doubled, compared 
to last year, to $2,320, the Transportation Ministry said. By comparison, 
visitors to South Korea spent only $1,355 per trip, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, Korean leaders have been telling the people to live frugally and 
sacrifice for the future," the Western diplomat said. But for the average 
Korean whose disposable income has increased in the past two years, "the future 
is now." 
</P>
<P>
Firms mainly engaged in domestic business scored double-digit growth in sales 
and profits, while export-oriented companies were doing only half as well, the 
Bank of Korea reported. Domestic-oriented firms were also accumulating assets 
faster and raising productivity by bigger margins, the bank added. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the overall business of the Hyundai conglomerate of companies, one of 
South Korea's most export-oriented business groups, is divided almost equally 
between the domestic market and overseas activities, Chung said. At its peak, 
he said, the group did 87% of its business overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Chung also said rising protectionist sentiment in the United States, South 
Korea's main market, is adding a coercive element to the transformation. "For 
protection against the protectionists, we're going to have to look inward for 
the first time in the country's economic development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Major new projects planned by the government promise to provide an even greater 
stimulus to growth at home in the coming years. Among them are plans to build 
two major satellite cities of Seoul, to construct 2 million housing units by 
1992, to expand subways in Seoul and to develop industrial complexes on the 
country's west coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Export Growth 
</P>
<P>
Growth in consumption that has exceeded 10% so far this year, however, has not 
replaced the decline in the growth of exports. In the first half of the year, 
overseas shipments increased 6.7%, compared to a 29% spurt last year, and the 
trade surplus fell to $2 billion, only 44% of the black ink in the same period 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Ro predicted, exports will grow by only 3%. 
</P>
<P>
And with the GNP expected to increase by no more than 7.5% after three straight 
years of 12%-plus growth, almost no one is happy about the transformation of 
the economy -- although the government of President Roh Tae Woo prescribed just 
such a change last fall in a new five-year development plan. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Roh and business leaders have devoted all of their attention to the 
negatives of the economic transformation. 
</P>
<P>
On June 19, the president declared war on spiraling wages, announcing his 
intention to hold future pay raises to less than 10% a year. Painting the 
country as if it were on the brink of economic collapse, officials released a 
spate of statistics purporting to show that South Korea was pricing itself out 
of competition in international markets and announced new policies to promote 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen warned that exorbitant wage increases would increase unemployment 
and cause a cost-push inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the ruling party have even started calling for a reversal of the 
won's appreciation to promote exports, saying the South Korean currency, which 
rose 16% in value last year, should now be devalued by 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The Korea Herald, in an editorial, condemned the domestic spending spree as 
"overindulgence in a quest for luxury" and "decadent commercialism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Real Problems 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Construction's Chung also viewed it as an unhealthy development. "Rapid 
wage increases," he complained, "are not turning into savings and new 
production facilities but are going into private consumption." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that some aspects of the boom constitute real problems. Land and 
stock transactions -- which brought speculators windfall capital gains equal to 
35% of the GNP in 1987, according to Ro -- are one such problem. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988 and 1989, the gains will be even bigger," the Korea Development 
Institute analyst added. This "asset effect," along with wage increases, he 
said, is contributing to greater consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Plummeting investment in new factory equipment to increase productive capacity 
is another worry, Chung insisted. "There's a rush to grab what you can grab 
right now," Ro complained. 
</P>
<P>
What Deputy Prime Minister Cho Soon called widespread inequities in wealth 
contribute to that mentality. Cho said in a speech in June that a majority of 
the people feel that they live in relative poverty while the rich keep 
accumulating ever-greater wealth. 
</P>
<P>
While 20% of the people receive 43.7% of the national income, the poorest 40% 
get only 17.7%, Cho said. The inequity in land ownership, however, is far 
greater: The richest 5% of the population possesses 65.2% of the privately 
owned land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have refused to heed calls for moderation, Ro said, because "they don't 
believe the statistics the government and management provide. Even more, they 
believe they can demand more because the government has been accommodating 
their demands. They believe they have been sacrificed in the process of 
economic growth and deserve rapid wage increases." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even the underworld is becoming more assertive. 
</P>
<P>
A thief who broke into a home in an upper-class section of Seoul in June 
started sending extortion letters to his victim demanding compensation when he 
discovered that the jewelry that he had stolen consisted entirely of 
imitations. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the knife-wielding man who broke into the home of a former 
defense minister and demanded cash. Offered the equivalent of $1,050, he 
threatened the retired general with bodily injury and said the sum should have 
been beneath the dignity of a former Cabinet official. After the victim 
promised to hand over an extra $3,000 the next day, the robber left. But when 
he came back to collect, police were on hand to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're looking for a docile, well-disciplined, cheap work force, you're no 
longer thinking of Korea," the Western diplomat said. Korean workers, he added, 
are convinced that "we've got to get as much as we can as soon as we can 
because this (situation) can't go on for long." 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen, however, are quietly making adjustments to the new era in South 
Korea, producing more high value-added products such as videocassette 
recorders, sophisticated computer-controlled machine tools and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea, as Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry noted, has 
already surpassed France and West Germany in its semiconductor production. 
</P>
<P>
Korean manufacturers are also carrying out automation programs to reduce labor 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Namil's Cho, for example, said his firm plans to nearly triple its annual sales 
to $100 million in five years without adding to its present labor force of 600 
employees. And textile makers and footwear manufacturers are moving some of 
their operations out of the country, mainly to Southeast Asia.

Designer Bob Mackie donated a beaded black sweater that would carry a lofty 
price tag of $600 at Neiman Marcus. Fancy-dress maker Holly Harp provided a 
flounced frock that still had the Bergdorf Goodman label in it and might have 
sold for $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Such a deal at $100 each. 
</P>
<P>
That will be the asking price for each of those designer pieces when Dollars 
for Scholars, a temporary "store" operated by students of the Fashion Institute 
of Design and Merchandising, opens Thursday at the school on Seventh Street in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit store, stocked with clothing, jewelry, toys and household items 
donated by 300 retailers and manufacturers, is a "merchandise laboratory class" 
designed to give the students hands-on experience in retailing, according to 
Myrna Glenny, a faculty adviser. 
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth year for the retail venture, which raises funds for 
scholarships. Last year's take was more than $67,000, and students this year 
hope to hit $100,000. About 400 students pursuing careers in the fashion 
industry will participate in the 10-day exercise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Retailers Donate 
</P>
<P>
So far, they have spent six weeks preparing the 3,000-square-foot space. Late 
last week, they were scrambling to take inventory, build dressing rooms and tag 
and hang merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
By the time that the sale officially begins, students will have collected 
40,000 pieces of clothing and 30,000 yards of fabric that they expect to sell 
at 50% to 70% below retail cost. Items will include brands from such clothing 
makers and designers as Gilda Marx, Sandra Garratt, Koret, Christian de 
Castelnau, Lanz, Patti Cappalli and Jessica McClintock. For men and children, 
brands include Hanes, Quiksilver and Kennington. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's, the Broadway, Lady Foot Locker and Contempo Casuals were among 
retailers that donated items. Frederick's of Hollywood supplied the mannequins 
(sans sexy lingerie). 
</P>
<P>
Not all the garments will be one-of-a-kind treasures like the Mackie sweater. 
In some cases, damaged, irregular or sample items will be priced at as little 
as $2. But even first-quality merchandise will go for bargain-basement prices, 
relatively speaking, with the average cost ranging up to $50 for moderate 
sportswear and $60 to $70 for designer garments. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of our store as Pic 'N' Save with Nordstrom service," Glenny 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Training 
</P>
<P>
To get the word out, students are mailing reminders to previous customers and 
are handing out flyers to pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Student Cheryl Cedrone, 18, said she viewed the exercise as good preparation 
for a career as a manufacturer's representative. 
</P>
<P>
"When this started off, this was just an empty room," she said proudly as she 
surveyed the jam-packed space. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raiser or no, students realized that they had to take a realistic attitude 
toward thievery, one of the retail industry's biggest headaches. The project's 
budget allows for a bit of "shrinkage," Glenny noted, and signs posted at the 
door note sternly: "Shoplifters Will Be Prosecuted."

Gasoline Prices Drop: The average price of gasoline fell nearly 3 cents a 
gallon at the pump in the past three weeks, a nationwide survey found. The 
national average is $1.13 a gallon, 2.7 cents below the average on July 21, the 
Lundberg Survey reported. "A drop of this magnitude during such a short period 
is something that motorists have not seen since 1986," analyst Trilby Lundberg 
said. She said the price fall was caused by an oversupply brought on by 
overcompensation on the part of refiners and importers in response to "tight 
refining capacity and even tighter capacity for gasoline because of new vapor 
regulations." Federal vapor regulations have forced refiners to refrain from 
using butane for such properties as octane, she said. Production of inventory 
safety margins led to oversupply.

WPPSS PLANS NEW $450-MILLION BOND OFFERING; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITY WILL REPLACE HIGH-INTEREST INSTRUMENTS BEFORE DEFAULTED ISSUES SETTLED

Whoops. It's back. 
</P>
<P>
WPPSS -- the Washington Public Power Supply System, biggest municipal bond 
defaulter in history -- plans to return to the bond market for the first time 
since it failed to make good on $2.25 billion in bonds in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Next week it expects to sell $450 million in bonds that will replace 
high-interest bonds used to fund construction of two incomplete nuclear power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors burned by the bad WPPSS bonds are a bit miffed that WPPSS, which 
gained the pronunciation "whoops" after its infamous default -- is refinancing 
bonds before it settles all claims over the defaulted issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's a foolish move," said C. Richard Lehmann, who founded the 
Bond Investors Assn. in Miami to provide advice to holders of WPPSS bonds and 
other defaulted issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose of the refinancing is to save interest. It seems to me that 
it would behoove them to clear the air" on the old bonds first, he said. "I 
think it's going to have a financial effect on the interest rates they're going 
to have to pay" on the new bonds, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Savings Estimated 
</P>
<P>
WPPSS officials say, however, that it would be foolish to continue paying 
double-digit interest rates on the existing bonds for WPPSS nuclear units 1 and 
3. They say they hope to float the new bonds in the 7% range. 
</P>
<P>
WPPSS, a consortium of utilities formed to build five nuclear plants, estimates 
that it will save an average of $70 million to $80 million a year over the next 
30 years through the refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
Bond experts predict that WPPSS will have to pay a penalty in the form of 
higher interest on the bonds because of the default. They say the bonds may 
yield about a quarter basis point more than similarly rated bonds, according to 
the Bond Buyer, which called the bond sale the deal of the year. A basis point 
is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moody's Investors Service gave a rating of "A" to the new bonds, 
which it considers an upper medium-grade rating on a scale that runs from Aaa 
to D. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's said its rating is based on the fact that the bonds are backed by the 
Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that sells power in the 
Northwest. The BPA will finance the bonds through revenue that it receives from 
selling power generated by hydroelectric plants in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a change in the federal bankruptcy code last year clarified that 
WPPSS' units 1 and 3 are insulated from any legal claims against units 4 and 5, 
the ones that defaulted, in the event of a WPPSS bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the other major credit rating concern, last year 
reinstated its AA-minus rating on units 1 and 3 as well as unit 2, which is 
operating. The rating is a degree higher than Moody's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
250-Page Statement 
</P>
<P>
Heather L. Ruth, president of the Public Securities Assn., the main trade group 
for the municipal bond industry, said the fact that WPPSS is returning to the 
bond market indicates that its advisers feel enough time has passed since the 
default for the supply system's bad reputation to have faded. 
</P>
<P>
"If they weren't WPPSS they would have refunded much sooner," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite WPPSS' history, expectations are that the bond issue will have no 
trouble finding buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it's going to be a good deal," Ruth said.

TWA Lowers Fares: TWA announced savings of up to $160 off its lowest fares to 
attract passengers to the fall and 1990 travel seasons. The company's "lowest 
fare guarantee" ensures that even if TWA's fares are reduced after tickets are 
purchased, passengers will be refunded the difference, and they will be allowed 
one "free" travel date change without penalty. Tickets can be purchased any 
time before Sept. 1 and from Sept. 9 through Dec. 15 for domestic travel, and 
for international travel from Oct. 1 through May 21, 1990.

Continental Bank Stock Sale: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. plans to sell 
up to 9 million shares of Continental Bank Corp. common stock in another step 
to return the Chicago-based bank to public ownership, according to Securities 
and Exchange Commission documents. The sale, which would raise about $230 
million, would reduce the FDIC's direct and indirect control of the bank to 
about 26%. Shares of the bank company were up 12.5 cents at $25.50. The FDIC 
put up $4.5 billion in 1984 to rescue the bank, then known as Continental 
Illinois, which was threatened by a run on deposits. After the sale of the 
remainder of the stock, probably later this year, the FDIC's losses are 
expected to total about $2 billion.

Drexel to Pay Arkansas Fine: Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has agreed to pay a 
$100,000 fine to the Arkansas Securities Department even though the government 
said it has no evidence that the firm did anything wrong in the state. The 
consent order stems from the possibility that Drexel's Beverly Hills junk bond 
department might have committed improper trades in Arkansas from 1984 through 
1986. Drexel said it would pay the $100,000 even though it hasn't had an office 
in Arkansas for four or five years.

MEMO: SERVICE STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's some debate about where the first service station was. "It wasn't 
anything anyone really bothered to keep records about at the time," said Susan 
Hahn, a spokeswoman with the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest gas stations were probably nothing more than a guy with a gas tank 
at the back of a general store. 
</P>
<P>
Historical consensus places the first official filling station in St. Louis in 
1905. It was run by Clem Laessig and his partner Harry Grenner of the 
Automobile Gasoline Co., according to the "Chronological History of the 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries." Not unlike many of its modern 
counterparts, the station sold nothing but gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The first service station -- which sold oil and lubricants as well as gasoline 
-- was opened in 1907 in Seattle by Standard Oil of California on the site of a 
bulk fuel plant. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until 1911 that an oil company built a structure dedicated solely 
to retailing gasoline products. Predictably, it was in Detroit, at West Fort 
and First streets, and was opened by R. L. Francis of the Central Oil Co. The 
station -- whose driveways, pumps and other equipment cost $1,200 -- was the 
site of many firsts, including the first free air pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Its also foreshadowed modern service stations in another way: It was the first 
gas station to be robbed. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is happy with service station auto repairs, and the state Bureau 
of Automotive Repair keeps track of their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the most frequent complaints from 1986 to the present had to 
do with the bill. Some 3,138 consumers complained that stations failed to seek 
permission to proceed with repairs whose costs exceeded a quoted estimate. 
Another 2,820 complained that they received no estimate at all. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of others complained about their smog checks. More than 1,700 said 
they received no inspection at all. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps as a testament to the integrity of service station mechanics -- or 
the general ignorance of the average motorist -- only 35 persons complained of 
outright fraud, including just one person in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in service station auto repair, there still are plenty of 
places to get your car fixed, according to a recent study by the American 
Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
As cars last longer -- an average of 7.6 years in 1986, compared to 6.6 years 
in 1980 -- the auto repair business is booming. 
</P>
<P>
Employment at auto repair shops increased to 457,000 in 1986 from 350,000 in 
1980, the study found. Adjusted for inflation, auto repair services accounted 
for $30.1 billion in 1986, compared to $24.4 billion in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth in self-service gasoline sales is not a cause for concern about car 
maintenance," the study found. "Modern cars require much less routine 
servicing: Batteries are commonly maintenance-free, tires more durable and less 
prone to blowouts or flats, recommended oil changes less frequent and the need 
for tuneups much reduced," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who can't take their cars to a garage can now bring the garage to 
their cars. Several small auto repair businesses specialize in making house 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Mobile Mechanix fields a fleet of 12 vans outfitted with 
tools and parts. "Our mechanics are equipped to do everything except engine and 
transmission overhauls in the field," said Amo Rogers, vice president of the 
7-year-old Santa Ana company. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, Auto Medics Mobile Repair &amp; Rescue apparently 
has taken the house call analogy literally. The company has two vans and a tow 
truck, one of which is outfitted like an ambulance, complete with a light bar. 
The 8-year-old Van Nuys company assesses a minimum service charge of about $30 
for a run, which is applied to the repair bill, said co-owner Sharon McMullens. 
</P>
<P>
In South Pasadena, Rex Chambers' Mobile Auto Maintenance is basically Chambers 
and a van that he has driven everywhere from Costa Mesa to Duarte to Hemet 
since he started in 1986. He charges a minimum of $29 plus travel costs to fix 
cars. The reason he drives so far? "People need it to be done," said Chambers' 
partner Edie Stovall. PATRICK LEE

After years of research, Ford Motor Co. says it has developed a computer 
diagnostic system that hooks up to an automobile's on-board computer to analyze 
the car's problems and suggest possible repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Service Bay Diagnostic System, announced Friday by Ford at a University of 
Michigan automotive seminar, has been an advancement long studied in the U.S. 
auto industry since on-board computers were introduced in the late 1970s. These 
computers, some no larger than a cigarette package, run a car's engine, 
electrical, climate control and audio systems. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said the system will be available to its dealers in late 1990. It is 
believed to be the first such diagnostic tool that will be used by all dealers 
of a U.S. auto company. 
</P>
<P>
SBDS could mean $150 million in business for its developer, Hewlett-Packard of 
Palo Alto. Lee Miskowski, general manager of the Ford Parts and Service 
division, said the new system will cost $30,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Ford's 5,000 U.S. dealers must purchase some form of the system, 
although Miskowski said a smaller version might be developed for dealers with 
lower volume. 
</P>
<P>
The SBDS hooks up to a vehicle's on-board computer through a direct data link. 
It provides service technicians with information about a car's problems and 
offers possible repair solutions and technical information.

PATTERNED AFTER THE BRAIN, NEURAL NETWORKS SHOW PROMISE

<P>
In the beginning, there were digital computers. They were big, slow and very 
stupid. Half a century later, digital computers are very small and fast, but 
they're still hopeless idiots compared to humans. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem was, and still is, that computers just can't think. 
</P>
<P>
But what if computer circuits could be made to resemble our brains? What if 
they could learn from their mistakes? 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of tiny companies have sprung up in the past three years hoping to 
answer, and cash in on, those questions with an approach called neural networks 
-- after the neurons that are the basic structure of the human nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Tapang, a 36-year-old Filipino physicist who left Intel Corp. to start 
Syntonic Systems Inc., shipped what he believes is the first commercially 
available neural network chip to Electrodyne, a Japanese company, in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Combines Signals 
</P>
<P>
The chip is called DENDROS-1, a reference to dendrites, the highly branched 
filaments of nerve or brain cells that let the cells communicate. It simulates 
neurons by combining a variety of signals to come up with a single result. 
</P>
<P>
Tapang compares it to measuring the flow of water through a vast network of 
different-sized pipes by emptying them into a single pool. Such a system of 
computing values is called "analog," which implies a continuous form of 
measurement, like the sweep second hand on a watch. 
</P>
<P>
Digital computers, like digital watches, chop time and numbers into tiny bits 
and add them up one at a time. In fact, "bits" are the smallest unit of 
information in the binary system that is the "brain" of a digital computer. 
</P>
<P>
The great advantage of today's digital computers is that they can add those 
bits incredibly fast, even if it is done only one bit at a time. 
</P>
<P>
There is some evidence from research on animals and people that the neural 
cells in our brains use a kind of digital system to transmit signals. These 
on-off pulses, called spikes, confused early researchers and led some to 
believe that the brain relied on a digital model to process information. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they found that it was only a tiny portion of a complex 
electrochemical system that channels signals in the way that Tapang is trying 
to imitate. "A neuron by itself is dumb, but the totality of that network of 
neurons in our skull is probably the most intelligent machine in the universe," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The key word is "network." It is the interaction of neurons in our brains that 
gives rise to thought, not the action of a single neuron. 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, Tapang said, digital computers are doomed to be electronic 
dunces because their chips were designed to be solitary devices called central 
processing units, channeling all operations through one electronic "pipe." 
</P>
<P>
Even if CPUs are connected, the result is only a faster dunce. 
</P>
<P>
However, some computer scientists and industry analysts are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
Neural networks will "be a fine addition to what we've got now but they'll just 
supplement it," said Esther Dyson, editor and publisher of Release 1.0, a New 
York-based computer newsletter. "They'll never replace the mathematically 
precise logic of a digital system. 
</P>
<P>
"I fundamentally disagree with this 'baited breath' attitude in the industry 
about the next breakthrough being neural chips or networks. They're good at 
things like pattern recognition but still cannot cope with our kind of 'fuzzy 
thinking.' A lawyer might ask, 'Colonel North, why did you do that?' and accept 
a fuzzy answer, but a computer can't." 
</P>
<P>
One San Jose-based company, Synaptics, has used neural network technology to 
develop what it calls a Silicon Retina. An array of photo sensors emulates the 
light receptors in the eye, and an analog computer processes the image for 
display on a video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Tapang uses capacitors to simulate neurons, which rely on chemicals to transmit 
signals between synapses. Capacitors store and release electricity in much the 
same way. DENDROS-1 has one fixed connection and 22 variable ones that simulate 
synapses. It can be layered with other chips to create an overlapping network 
of communicating capacitors that "fire" signals to each other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Applications 
</P>
<P>
As in the brain, the firing of one electronic neuron affects the others. An 
important feature is each neuron's ability to damp its neighbors, creating a 
pattern. The variable interaction is a crucial part of the network. 
</P>
<P>
The applications for Tapang's chip include things like pattern recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson agrees that the best uses for neural chips and networks would be tasks 
like analyzing seismic patterns to predict earthquakes and to hunt for oil or 
gas, analyzing brain waves, identifying fingerprints or other classification 
chores. 
</P>
<P>
But she remains skeptical about their potential. So does Dave Waltz, of 
Thinking Machines Corp. in Cambridge, Mass., which makes a supercomputer built 
of up to 64,000 digital processors harnessed together. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with neural networks is that you can't keep expanding them, Waltz 
said. "The whole field of neuropsychology says that increasing the scale means 
greater complexity. If you scale up the size of a neural net you increase the 
complexity of solving the problems you give it."

JACK SMITH: READER REPORT ON MORTUARIES: NEVER A WAKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In listing some of the cute business names collected by Helen W. Rogaway on a 
recent motor trip, I noted that there were no dentists or funeral parlors on 
the list, and suggested that they might be immune to the cute craze. 
</P>
<P>
But almost nothing is absolutely so. (Notice I said almost nothing.) Robert and 
Betty Mehnert send me a clipping from a Buffalo phone book advertising Amigone 
Funeral Homes. One might suspect that Amigone is a macabre play on "Am I gone?" 
However, it turns out, innocently, to be the name of the proprietor, Anthony 
Amigone. 
</P>
<P>
That's the closest thing to a cute funeral parlor name as I have found, but the 
Rev. Edward P. Allen, rector of St. Andrew &amp; St. Charles Episcopal Church, 
Granada Hills, wistfully offers one he thought up. 
</P>
<P>
"During a stay at Mammoth a few years back," he recalls, "I noticed how that 
growing community was developing the basic services for a skiing population: 
condos, banks, restaurants, garages, sporting goods stores, and an amazing 
number of orthopedic medical facilities. However, there was still no hospital 
to bring newcomers into the world, nor a funeral parlor to usher people out. 
With my ministerial skills honed in formalizing the hatching, matching, and 
dispatching of human lives, I fantasized opening an undertaking emporium and 
calling it 'Apres-Ski.' " 
</P>
<P>
Both Bob Gipple of Apple Valley and Barbara J. Huddleston of Hesperia have sent 
me an ad from the Yellow Pages for a dental center in Hesperia called "The 
Filling Station." 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses, Jodi Rogaway of La Crescenta (Helen Rogaway's daughter) and 
Doris Larson of Arroyo Grande, report seeing a dental office on San Juan Island 
(a ferry ride from Seattle) named The Tooth Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rogaway adds: "The pun mania rubbed off on me -- my diet and fitness 
business is registered with the Small Business Administration as 'New-trition.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
I said I doubted that you would be likely to see a bail bonds house named Bail 
Bonds R Us. But bail bondsmen aren't above a little fun. Barbara Watson of 
Pacoima writes that she used to advertise her bail bond business with a 
personalized license plate that read "Bail 4 U." 
</P>
<P>
Willard Olney of Hesperia sends a snapshot of a trailer parked along the 
freeway a bit south of Devore. It advertises: "Faul's Bail Bonds: I'll Get You 
Out If It Takes 20 Years." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cooper of Downey writes that Downey has a bail bond house with the name and 
slogan "Deep Water Bail Bonds: Don't Go to Bed with a Price on Your Head." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Aiken of Laguna Niguel reports that on South Coast Highway in Laguna 
Beach there is a woman's lingerie shop called "I C London." Like Mrs. Aiken I 
didn't get the point at first. 
</P>
<P>
She says: "I drove past it for years without thinking anything about it, and 
then my smart husband reminded me of the little rhyme we used to chant as 
children when we wanted to taunt someone: 
</P>
<P>
"I see London 
</P>
<P>
"I see France 
</P>
<P>
"I see Mary's underpants. (Insert the name of whatever child you're 
pestering.)" 
</P>
<P>
Barbara B. Moe of Santa Ana nominates as the ultimate in cuteness a plant shop 
in the Tustin area called "Holly, Wood &amp; Vine." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Lundstrom of Arcadia reports that an athletic shoe store in the Santa 
Anita Mall used to be called Athlete's Foot, but it lasted only about a year. 
"I learned they'd changed the name because it was negatively affecting their 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Weir Jr. of Playa del Rey recalls a bar in Chicago called the Hotsy 
Totsy Yacht Club. "They do not have a burgee or members. It was previously 
called the Hotsy Totsy Yacht Club and Bait Shop and was (allegedly) a pick-up 
joint." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Glattenberg of Santa Clarita recalls photographing a liquor store in 
Cheyenne, Wyo., named "DT's." "The building was decorated with pink elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Leland C. Thoburn of Tujunga remembers an antique store near Sunset and Vermont 
named "Den of Antiquity." William Barnett Spivak reports spotting a poultry 
shop in Boyle Heights named "Elmer Dickens' Eggs &amp; Chickens." 
</P>
<P>
Patti Garrity thinks the Bank of America should open a branch on the Seine 
called Right Bank of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
I think I've got a great name for a book shop specializing in philosophy and 
myth: "Jack Smith's Myth and Pith."

BAIL SET FOR PAROLE AGENT IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bail was set at $250,000 on Sunday for James F. Valante, the state parole agent 
from Stanton who allegedly shot his mother Friday night, an Orange County Jail 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Valante, 42, was being held at the jail on suspicion of attempted murder. 
Arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Valante's mother, Virginia Sprehe, 64, was in fair condition at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where she is recovering from surgery for a bullet wound in 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
And Valante's son, Matthew, 3, who was with Valante when he surrendered to 
sheriff's deputies Saturday, was being cared for by his maternal grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sheriff's Department officials, someone called 911 on Friday 
evening to report that he had just shot his mother. The man repeated the 
statement, then hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Responding deputies found Sprehe on the floor of Valante's home, shot in the 
back, but Valante was nowhere to be seen. They looked for him Friday night and 
early Saturday, only to have him and his son walk into their home shortly after 
noon on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waited for Surrender 
</P>
<P>
For an hour, sheriff's deputies crouched behind bushes and patio walls, 
sometimes with guns drawn, as they waited for Valante to give up. Meanwhile, 
Lt. William Francis talked to Valante, who surrendered at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, life was back to normal at the Bell Cove townhouse complex where 
Valante, Sprehe and Matthew live. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors remain puzzled by the shooting. Valerie Zahn, whose young 
daughter regularly played with Matthew, said that Valante's world had centered 
on his son lately. He had been on medical disability since April, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But recently Valante was upset because his ex-wife, Karen, had a serious 
boyfriend, Zahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Zahn said she knew he had a gun that he sometimes carried in his pocket, but 
she thought he kept it as protection in his parole agent job. She said she 
never thought he would use the gun on a relative. "Something triggered him 
off."

WRY BOATMAN TO THE STARS SHOWS VISITORS POSH NEWPORT BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim (Sandbar) Orr was on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
One hand gripped the wheel of the Pavilion Paddy, a double-decker sightseeing 
boat cruising through Newport Harbor. A microphone rested in his other big 
mitt. The Lido Isle Bridge lay dead ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of you sitting on the roof, I've got some bad news," Sandbar 
announced over the public address system to the two dozen folks on board. "The 
bridge is a pigeon roost. . . . But it is biodegradable." 
</P>
<P>
A smattering of nervous laughter came from up top. In a hushed voice, Sandbar 
continued: "We'll want to be quiet so as not to disturb their anatomical 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
As the boat slid under the bridge, a whimsical glint lit Sandbar's eyes. With a 
flourish, he jabbed the ship's horn. 
</P>
<P>
Whaaa! Whaaa! Whaaa! 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to fabulous Newport Harbor, land of millionaire beachcombers, home of 
starlets and swabbies, taxiway for tour boats like the Tiki, the Belle, the 
Showboat, the Pavilion Queen. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the Pavilion Paddy and its droll and devoted captain, the one 
and only Sandbar. 
</P>
<P>
Several times each day, this seafaring Robin Leach leads boatloads of tourists 
on jaunts through the harbor waterways, guiding them past the haunts, houses 
and yachts of Newport's rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
In a melodic baritone that a radio pitchman would envy, Sandbar regales his 
guests with tales of the harbor's past and present, pointing out erstwhile 
homes of such movie legends as John Wayne, Dick Powell and Shirley Temple, as 
well as present abodes of industry captains and development tycoons. 
</P>
<P>
As the stories mount, Sandbar's mustache -- the ends waxed into stiff stalks 
like pipe cleaners -- rises as he smiles. But it's not all shtick. 
</P>
<P>
Steering past three homes perched at water's edge, Sandbar's voice grows solemn 
as he tells his passengers how legendary comedian Joe E. Brown bought the 
houses years ago with plans to occupy them, along with his two sons. Within a 
month, however, the eldest son died in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
"The comedian blamed the harbor for his sudden misfortune, so he sold the 
homes, never to return to Newport," Sandbar said. 
</P>
<P>
Down another channel, he relates the tale of how actor James Cagney reportedly 
won one of the harbor's islands in a poker game. 
</P>
<P>
Then, nearing a small knob of land smothered with fine homes, the captain said 
the mid-channel perch, dubbed Sand Island, was once owned by a woman who hated 
cars. To this day, no automobiles are allowed on the island, which is connected 
to the mainland only by a small footbridge. 
</P>
<P>
The audience, each of whom paid $5 for a 45-minute tour, was a bit dubious when 
the cruise began but seemed to warm as Sandbar and the sun worked their effect. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Myers, owner of a St. Louis firm that does salvage work for insurance 
firms, hopped aboard Pavilion Paddy with his wife, Carol, to help celebrate 
their 20th wedding anniversary. After spending the first half of the tour up 
top, Myers stepped down the spiral staircase to the lower deck and was shocked 
to find Sandbar with the microphone in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a recording, then I came down here and here he was talking," 
Myers said, a bit bemused by it all. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing that, Sandbar hoisted the microphone and announced that Myers had just 
bought a $10-million seaside home off the port bow for his bride. 
</P>
<P>
The Midwestern visitor smiled. "It's a nice tour," he said. "I think we would 
probably come back." 
</P>
<P>
After one recent 45-minute tour ended and the guests went ashore, Sandbar told 
how he got his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran aground," he said simply. It was 22 years ago, Sandbar's first season as 
a tour guide. He was piloting the Bay Queen, struck a reef and stuck. The boat 
had to be pulled off, but the only damage was to his ego. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire town heard about it," said Sandbar, now a portly, 42-year-old 
harbor veteran. "They emptied out all the drinking establishments. There were 
probably 80 people on the dock when we returned to meet 'Captain Sandbar.' It's 
stuck. To this day, everyone just calls me Sandbar." 
</P>
<P>
Does his wife call him Sandbar? 
</P>
<P>
"Several of them have," he said. "I've run aground a bit in the matrimonial 
department. I'm heading for wife No. 6." 
</P>
<P>
A Newport native who grew up on the water, Sandbar has seen plenty of changes 
along the waterfront, and his tour business has reflected them. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, it's gone from movie stars to business people," he said. "But 
the tastes of the passengers have changed too. In the past they wanted to see 
the movie stars' homes. Today, they want to know where the real estate moguls 
are. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as people used to be awed by movie stars, they're now awed by the 
numbers. I don't think they care who lives there when I'm talking about a 
$19-million house." 
</P>
<P>
With a wink, Sandbar admitted that he occasionally "bends the truth" to rib a 
passenger. A reporter who lives in Santa Ana, for instance, was suddenly and 
unexpectedly given ownership of a prominent Newport Harbor home during a tour. 
Sandbar went on to embellish the tall tale by revealing that wild parties are 
held at the luxurious house most weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Some real-life seafront residents, however, have been shy about their mansions 
being displayed as landmarks to tourists from Iowa and others taken along their 
shore. Some have even asked the various harbor cruise lines to refrain from 
identifying their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Sandbar and the other tour skippers willingly comply. "We're out here to show 
visitors a good time, not to harass people who are locals, so to speak," 
Sandbar said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a little bit entertainment, a little bit education," the comical 
captain said. "We just want people to enjoy it. This is one of the most 
beautiful harbors in the world, so it's only natural to show it off. . . . It's 
Disneyland by the sea, with millionaires on either shore."

EVEN SOME OF THE BAD GUYS WILL MISS HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting in the lounge of Reuben's restaurant, John McClain looks more like one 
of the courthouse lawyer crowd surrounding him than a guy who first became a 
cop during the heyday of "Dragnet." 
</P>
<P>
His suit looks expensive, he drinks Grand Marnier. The only thing unfashionable 
about him are the Pall-Mall nonfilters he puffs for the next seven hours on 
this, the last night of his 30-year career with the Santa Ana Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Can this be the guy who solved all but one of his murder cases before turning 
in his badge last week? The detective who wooed a confession out of a killer 
who ate his victim's heart? An investigator who gets thank-you's and Christmas 
cards from burglars and murderers he has busted? 
</P>
<P>
You bet, say his fans, including prosecutors and judges, criminal defense 
attorneys and his barber of 15 years, and many others who dropped by the bar to 
say farewell. One fan, a free-lance writer, hopes to feature McClain in a 
detective magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a half-dozen outstanding homicide police detectives in this county, 
he is absolutely one of them," said James G. Enright, Orange County's chief 
deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But with his 30 years on the force, McClain, 53, is eligible for a pension 
equal to 75% of his salary. He plans to take some time to decompress, then 
pursue a new career with the skills of his old profession: consulting for law 
firms that specializes in defending cops. 
</P>
<P>
Says Enright: "He will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
McClain grew up in a succession of homes in Southern California, the result of 
his parents' divorces and remarriages. He sometimes loses count of them all. 
Football offered him a sense of belonging and he played on scholarships for 
both Riverside City College and San Diego State. A knee injury (his third) 
ended his college football career. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Army and became a military policeman, serving 1 1/2 years in 
Korea. He finished his 3-year tour at Ft. Lewis, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, McClain decided while reading a magazine that he would become a cop, a 
story he tells with his trademark dry humor. The magazine combined scantily 
dressed women and "articles like, 'I Fought My Way Out of a Tribe of 
Blood-Thirsty Pygmies in the South African Jungle,' " McClain said. "High 
adventure stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying around in the barracks . . . wondering what I was going to do 
next, and picked up this magazine. There was a page full of things for men 
interested in high adventure, including job openings for police officers in 
Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
He bought a '52 yellow and black Mercury and headed south. The car broke down 
along the way, so he rolled it off a cliff and hitchhiked the rest of the way. 
He joined the Santa Ana police force that month and married a few years later. 
He has a daughter, 28, and a son, 27, from that marriage, which ended in 
divorce. He has since remarried. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964 McClain left patrol for the investigations bureau, where he handled a 
variety of crimes. "Resorting," a now defunct city law, was one of them. Men 
and women who stole off to have sex out of wedlock in motels were guilty of 
"resorting," said McClain, who mused that he always felt sheepish arresting 
someone "for resorting to something we were all interested in doing." 
</P>
<P>
At both solving a crime and finding the bad guy, McClain was gifted, former 
partners and co-workers said. 
</P>
<P>
In those pre-Miranda rights days, he said, it was much easier to get a burglar 
to confess. But former partners and colleagues say McClain also made his own 
luck because of his way with people. They say he is able to size them up, 
figure out how to appeal to them, then say just the right thing to get them to 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
There was the case of Bob, a member of a gang suspected of commiting a rash of 
burglaries 25 years ago, including a break-in at the presidential campaign 
headquarters of Barry Goldwater. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most burglars, Bob did not drink or take drugs. He just got in with the 
wrong crowd. When Bob was captured in Florida, McClain flew back to bring his 
prisoner home for trial. The jailers there barely provided Bob with food and 
water and, in fact, treated him roughly. McClain fed Bob, then gave him what he 
calls "The Program." 
</P>
<P>
The shackles could be removed and Bob could walk to the car with dignity if he 
agreed to walk one step ahead and one step to the left of McClain. "That way," 
McClain recalled telling him, "everybody won't be staring at you like a dog, 
and more importantly they won't be staring at me. Now, if you pull something 
funny, it's not going to be like TV where I chase you up and down escalators. 
I'll just have to shoot you dead. OK, Bob?" 
</P>
<P>
Bob nodded. They got in the car and McClain told Bob he wanted him to tell the 
truth, to unburden himself of the burglaries by telling him all about them, 
every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
With a heavy sigh, Bob confided that, yes, he had given it deep thought in his 
jail cell and he wanted to tell the truth -- about all three burglaries. 
McClain then proceeded to explain the "Posse Comma Tosse" law. He told Bob that 
if he revealed the whole truth about the number of break-ins, McClain would be 
able to take him to California for trial. Otherwise, McClain would have to 
invoke the nonexistent "Posse Comma Tosse" law and leave Bob to the 
inhospitable jailers in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Bob admitted his math was a little off -- there were actually four 
dozen burglaries in which he had participated. Then he took notebook and pencil 
and wrote down every one of them and included the where and when and how they 
were accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later -- and one day before McClain's retirement -- Bob (who 
served several years in prison for the crimes) showed up at police 
headquarters. He had read about McClain's retirement and wanted to wish him 
well, to tell him he was making a clean living installing car stereos, to thank 
him for turning his life around. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wanted to thank me for treating him like a man when I could have 
treated him like a dog," McClain said, still marveling at the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a classic McClain story," said Jay Mosely, a deputy district attorney 
who has known McClain for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, McClain moved to crimes against persons, a detective bureau that 
investigated murders, rapes, armed robberies and other assaults. These, he 
said, were "real crimes, crimes that everybody just knows are wrong. You can't 
undo the fact that someone was killed, but the work itself was great." 
</P>
<P>
For the next 10 years, McClain developed a reputation for being "one of the 
young, hard-working hotshot detectives," Enright recalled. Of the 37 murder 
cases he was assigned, McClain solved all but one. And in that case, the only 
witness to the crime -- the victim -- died after refusing to identify his 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Former partner Larry J. Cornelison, now resident agent in charge of the Santa 
Ana office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, tells the 
story of the pair's investigation into a grisly hatchet slaying of a service 
station attendant. 
</P>
<P>
There were few leads until a man called detectives to report that he had spent 
the night in jail with a man who bragged of the killing, a man who wore what 
turned out to be the brand new but blood-spattered denim jacket of the victim. 
McClain and Cornelison traced the jacket to a drifter named Steve Hurd and 
arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd insisted he was someone else, that he had stolen the jacket from the real 
Hurd. As they sat across the table from Hurd, McClain and Cornelison gave the 
guy the two-punch. Cornelison preached of the immorality of stealing the 
jacket. McClain, who had been nodding sympathetically as Hurd spoke, all of a 
sudden slammed his hand down on the table and said, "You took the most 
important thing to this guy, you took his life!" 
</P>
<P>
Hurd hung his head in his hands and tearfully confessed to his role in the 
hatchet killing -- plus one more murder. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very charitable at this point and he said, 'Well, now that I'm telling 
you this I might as well tell you about the other one," McClain recalled. "And 
we said, 'Uh, sure.' " 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the suspect had been involved in the brutal slaying of a 
schoolteacher whose heart had been removed by Hurd and his fellow 
Satan-worshipers and consumed by them. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd was convicted of the crimes and is still in prison. 
</P>
<P>
McClain "just knows what to say at the perfect time," Deputy D.A. Mosely said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran detective-sergeant's career almost ended eight months ago when 
then-Chief Clyde Cronkite gave him four days' notice that he was being 
transferred from the detective bureau to patrol. 
</P>

"They picked the wrong guy to mess with," said Don Blankenship, president of 
the Police Benevolent Assn. "Guys were figuring, if they would do this to this 
guy, it could happen to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Charging that his transfer and that of several others was punishment for their 
roles as union wage negotiators, McClain won a Superior Court restraining order 
temporarily blocking the transfer. A few weeks later, Cronkite quit and new 
Chief Paul Walters reinstated McClain and others. 
</P>
<P>
McClain said he decided five years ago to quit police work as soon as he 
reached the age when his retirement pension was at its highest. That was Aug. 
8, last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"You're almost crazy not to leave when you reach this point so you can go work 
somewhere else. At 75% of my salary? And besides, I think 30 years is enough at 
this. There's more to life than this." 
</P>
<P>
McClain was remarried nearly 9 years ago to Bonnie, real estate broker and 
herself a former Santa Ana police officer and the city's first woman sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
Besides pursuing a job as a consultant to law firms that specialize in 
defending cops, McClain is busying himself making a blackjack table for a small 
retirement party he is throwing himself this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a little weepy when I turned in the badge," he said, "but I have no 
regrets. It was a good job."

POSTSCRIPT: BIRDS AT SPILL NEEDED STUDY, SO SHE FLEW INTO ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been a hectic few months, and by mid-May Marge Gibson was ready for a 
break. Besides rearing a teen-age daughter and managing the chemistry 
laboratory at Orange Coast College, Gibson, 40, had for weeks been caring for 
nearly two dozen hawks, falcons and owls wounded earlier in the year in an 
unprecedented rash of bird shootings in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The summer, she had hoped, would be less demanding. 
</P>
<P>
But then came the phone call. It was an official with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service who wanted Gibson to work as part of a special team being 
assembled in Alaska to assess the impact of the oil spill from the Exxon tanker 
Valdez on the bald eagle population of Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, a specialist in rehabilitating birds of prey, could not resist. This 
would be a chance to study one of Nature's largest and most powerful birds in 
what many experts believe was North America's worst environmental disaster. She 
left her Villa Park home for a 2 1/2-month stint in Alaska, having contracted 
with Exxon through the federal government to head up one of two research teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible opportunity," Gibson said by phone last week from Alaska, 
before she returned home. "It's been hard on my family, being away this long, 
but I couldn't pass it up." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2,500 to 3,000 bald eagles inhabit the sound and surrounding 
backcountry. Indeed, the area is believed to have one of the highest 
concentrations of the species in the world. The bald eagle, whose wingspan can 
reach 7 feet, is a solitary predator, and it can live as long as 30 years in 
the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists and environmentalists feared that the March 24 spill, which involved 
240,000 barrels of thick North Slope crude oil, would endanger the species. 
Beyond the immediate concern of rescuing oil-soaked birds, officials were 
worried about how much oil the birds had ingested through fish, their primary 
prey, that had been contaminated, and also the effect on their ability to 
reproduce successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson and her three-member team spent their time there searching the 
oil-stained islands and inlets for bald eagles, capturing them, cleaning them 
and assessing their health. Her team operated out of the port city of Valdez 
(the second team was based in Kodiak, about 250 miles away). The teams managed 
to capture 75 of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said she was at once "exhilarated" by the area's beauty and saddened by 
the sight of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles and miles of beaches are coated with black tar," she said. "What took 
thousands of years to take shape was spoiled in a few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials largely credit Gibson with setting up a blood test to determine 
whether any of the birds' vital organs -- liver, kidney or spleen -- had been 
contaminated with oil. Blood was drawn at the capture site, and after a few 
quick tests, the researchers were able to determine whether an individual bird 
was healthy enough to be released or whether it needed to be taken to a 
wildlife rehabilitation facility in Valdez for observation and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Marge was instrumental in shaping the eagle capture project," said Tom 
Monahan, Exxon's coordinator of wildlife rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson is one of a small number of people licensed by the California Department 
of Fish and Game to rehabilitate endangered species such as golden eagles and 
peregrine falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has spent more than $300,000 on the project, Monahan said. It appears 
that, based on the number of eagles the two teams had trapped through last 
week, the species has weathered the spill in relatively good shape. The "vast 
majority" of birds captured were released, he said. Monahan cautioned, however, 
that it may be several years before a complete assessment of the spill's impact 
can be made. More than 800 miles of beaches were befouled, and local fisheries 
are threatened with years of dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, who returned home this past weekend, agreed: "It is much, much too soon 
to know what long-term effects this may have" on the species. "All we can do is 
hope our work may provide some clues." 
</P>
<P>
From Valdez, Gibson and her colleagues used float planes or boats to reach 
nesting areas, often staying out a week or longer. The researchers used fish as 
bait to capture the eagles, Gibson said; they did not used any tranquilizers. A 
monofilament line would be tied around a fish, usually a herring, then the fish 
would be tossed into the water near where a bald eagle had been spotted. When 
the bird swooped in after the fish, grabbing it with its talons, the researcher 
would pull the fishing line, pulling it like a noose around the bird. A piece 
of driftwood was attached to the fishing line, so that the bird would only be 
able to rise a few feet above the water when it tried to fly. The researchers 
would then grab the bird, put a hood over its head to calm it down, then 
examine it. 
</P>
<P>
A primary concern, Gibson said, was whether feathers on the underside carried 
even a trace of oil. A single drop of petroleum can penetrate an egg and kill 
an embryo, so cleaning the underside of an adult eagle was a critical concern. 
Monahan said the rescuers discovered that a simple solution of household dish 
soap and water was most effective in removing oil from birds' feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Each captured eagle was banded with a silver tag labeled with a number so that 
it could be tracked in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The long separation from family and friends for a cause such as this was worth 
it, she said. "The bald eagle is such a proud bird," Gibson said. "It is truly 
a treasure worth fighting to save." 
</P>
<P>
One of the eagles Gibson captured was too crippled to be freed, so Gibson will 
care for it in her rehabilitation center in Villa Park, and she intends to show 
it during lectures. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim is always to release birds," Gibson said, "but we couldn't safely do 
that with this bird. But at least I'll get a chance to share it with a lot of 
people who otherwise might never see one."

STEVENSON, STEFFES TAKE DIRECT ROUTE TO VOLLEYBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Youth was served Sunday at the Seal Beach Open. 
</P>
<P>
Served, but not blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Stevenson and Kent Steffes, relative youngsters on the Assn. of Volleyball 
Professionals tour, walked away with the championship for the first time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, 26, and Steffes, 21, survived the winners' bracket, then overpowered 
an overworked Jay Hanseth and Leif Hanson, 15-9, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to get some new faces in there," Steffes said. 
</P>
<P>
Steffes said he might have been the youngest person to win a pro volleyball 
tournament since Sinjin Smith 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, now 31, and Randy Stoklos were the top-seeded team in the tournament. 
However, they were sent packing to the losers' bracket early in the day with a 
15-12 loss to Stevenson and Steffes. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland, the second-seeded team, also were in the losers' 
bracket after losing to Hanseth and Hanson, 15-6, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Smith-Stoklos and Dodd-Hovland alliances had won 16 of the previous 
20 tournaments. But neither could manage to get back into the final. 
</P>
<P>
"We suddenly realized there were no seeded teams left in the winners' bracket 
and we started thinking we could win it," Steffes said. 
</P>
<P>
After working through the winners' bracket, Stevenson and Steffes were rewarded 
with a two-hour break. While the other teams competed in the sun for the right 
to play in the final, they sat in the shade conserving energy. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all out there groveling in the losers' bracket and we were in the 
tent relaxing," Steffes said. "We knew that was going to make a big 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
At the Rochester Open on July 30, it was Stevenson and Steffes who had to work 
to reach the final. They worked themselves out of the losers' bracket only to 
lose to Dodd and Hovland. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, Stevenson and Steffes were rested for the final. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson and Hanseth had three grueling matches in the losers' bracket, including 
a second victory over Dodd and Hovland (15-7). When it came time for the final, 
they were worn out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to use that as an excuse, because Jon and Kent played a great 
match," Hanseth said. "But we were both starting to cramp up in the losers' 
bracket final. We were really running out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
They made a go of it, though. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 10-4, Hanson and Hanseth made a run, scoring five 
consecutive points to cut the score to 10-9. But Stevenson and Steffes had the 
fresher legs and were able to close out the victory with a flurry of kills and 
some timely blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't play our best in the final," Stevenson said. "But we'll take 
it."

RASMUSSEN LIFTS LONG BEACH PAST METROPOLITAN ALL-STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the 24th Metropolitan League all-star game Sunday at Anaheim Stadium, 
announcer Ken Hill asked the crowd of about 400 to stay for the announcement of 
the most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
The plea did little to hold the audience, though, because the choice was 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rasmussen sealed his honor with a two-out, three-run double in the eighth 
inning to lift the Long Beach 49ers to a 3-2 victory over the league's 
all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen was an All-Sunset League outfielder at Huntington Beach High School 
in 1985. He started in right field for the next two seasons at Orange Coast 
College, then transferred to Lewis &amp; Clark College. He played on its 1988 
National Assn. Intercollegiate Athletics championship team in 1988. He said he 
sat out the 1989 season for disciplinary reasons at Lewis &amp; Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to return to Lewis &amp; Clark," Rasmussen said. "But I'm also keeping 
my options open." 
</P>
<P>
The double ended an afternoon of frustration for the Long Beach batters. Before 
the eighth, the league champion 49ers managed four hits and a walk off five 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Especially impressive was starter John O'Donahue of the Cypress Dawgs. He 
struck out the first two hitters, allowed a triple, then struck out the final 
four hitters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Erick Gomez of the Pomona Colts followed with two shutout innings. Todd Long of 
the Huntington Beach Rustlers and Tim Kelly and Matt Lipscomb of the Fullerton 
Blues each pitched a shutout inning. 
</P>
<P>
"You just get a little more amped pitching in the Big A," Kelly said. "There's 
no doubt it adds another three or four miles per hour to your fastball." 
</P>
<P>
The all-stars led, 2-0, going into the eighth. Jim Short of Fullerton had an 
RBI groundout in the fourth and Rob Donlan of the Anaheim Amigos had an RBI 
double in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers loaded the bases in the eighth on a walk, a single and an error off 
losing pitcher Shane Romney of the Huntington Beach Rustlers. 
</P>
<P>
Romney then fell behind Rasmussen, two balls and a strike, before giving up the 
game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking fastball all the way," Rasmussen said. "I'd missed a slider on 
the pitch before and I just told myself I had to wait for the fastball."

Q &amp; A: S. KELLY MCDERMOTT; 
</P>
<P>
THE BIG PICTURE ON HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
MARKET PROFILES OFFERS BUILDERS A WINDOW ON TRENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Flagg, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
S. Kelly McDermott started her career in advertising, but she now spends many 
of her days crunching numbers. McDermott is a vice president at Market Profiles 
of Costa Mesa, one of the better-known consultants to home builders and 
developers in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott has been watching Southern California real estate since the late 
1960s, first for big outfits such as Real Estate Research Corp. in Los Angeles, 
and later for smaller consulting firms such as Newport Economics in Orange 
County. Market Profiles employs about 40 in offices in San Diego, Denver and at 
its headquarters in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The past year has been one of turmoil for residential real estate in Orange 
County. It was a time that saw buyers scrambling to buy nearly anything that 
came on the market, even camping overnight to buy a new house. 
</P>
<P>
Prices -- already high -- went through the roof, and suddenly even relatively 
affluent county residents discovered that they could not buy a house. 
Condominiums became popular. Builders who had bought land before the boom made 
a fortune. Others frantically tried to find a patch of ground to build on so 
that they could get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
Things have quieted down, but home sales have still been exceptionally strong 
this year. Prices are continuing to rise, although not nearly as quickly as 
they were 1988. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott -- who has a bachelor of arts degree from UC Berkeley and has done 
graduate work at Cal State Fullerton in psychology and communications -- 
recently assessed the market for new homes in Orange County with Times staff 
writer Michael Flagg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. One week you hear home sales are slow, and the next you find some project 
that has people lined up waiting to buy. How are sales of new homes this year? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm amazed when people say home sales are slowing down. The year got off to 
a slow start, but for the years 1984 through 1988, approximately the same 
number of homes were sold (annually) in Orange County. The range is between 
10,000 and 13,000, which is pretty close. In 1988, for example -- which was 
such a frenzied year -- total sales were 11,269. In 1987, which was a very 
strong year but a more normal one in the sense that there wasn't this frenzied 
atmosphere, there were 13,498, or more sales than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So sales have been fairly steady this year? 
</P>
<P>
A. They certainly aren't slowing down. The pattern of sales activity is just 
different. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 you had people camping out; a builder would release 20 homes and -- 
bang -- they were gone. 1987 was a steadier year. It wasn't bumpy in the sense 
that 1988 was, where a builder would sell out all his homes in half an hour and 
then it'd be two months before he could build more and put them on the market. 
1987 and 1989 are just kind of running along, and to some people that makes 
them look different. They think if there's no frenzy of buying, it can't be a 
very good year. But 1989 is actually a very strong year. After all, the 
builders have already sold 5,600 houses this year. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Most people attributed the home-buying hysteria last year to the slow-growth 
initiative, which the building industry portrayed as a shutdown of new home 
construction. But the election in which it was defeated was in the middle of 
the year. What do you think caused the frenzy? 
</P>
<P>
A. It was partly the slow-growth initiative, and it was partly the result of 
the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which abolished tax write-offs for a great many 
different kinds of investments. Many people's accountants advised them to 
liquidate all their assets that had become non-performing and put their money 
into the biggest house they could buy, because that was the only write-off 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One hears about an influx of Asian buyers too. 
</P>
<P>
A. There was the Pacific Rim and Asian influence, which was the third big 
factor -- those buyers who came over and began buying property and detached 
homes here. So there were three things going on at the same time. And we were 
six years into a recovery; people had a lot of money. They were discovering 
they had a couple hundred thousand dollars' equity in their homes and they 
decided they should be doing something with it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Which of these factors would you say was most important? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's hard to say, but from a psychological viewpoint probably the most 
predominant factor in people's minds -- simply because the press gave it a lot 
of space -- was the slow-growth initiative. People thought there would be no 
more homes left, but of course that was illogical, especially after it was 
announced there would be these development agreements that would still permit 
many thousands of homes to be built. But once something like that gets rolling, 
it's no longer based on logic; it's based on emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Plus people were double-escrowing (agreeing to buy, then quickly reselling) 
homes and making $80,000 on them in a couple of months. Fear and greed are two 
powerful motivators. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who were these Asian buyers? Some builders I've talked to say Asian buyers 
account for one-third of the buyers at some of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, and at the high end of the market it could be as many half. Some of 
them are people who had lived in Southern California a long time and found 
themselves with a lot of equity in their houses. A lot of them had moved here 
with their companies. And some of them are investors. When you consider how 
little $450,000 buys in Japan, buying a house here is like being let loose in 
the candy store. The desire to get money out of Asia on the part of investors 
is also very strong after the recent events in China. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the resale market? How do the markets for new and used homes 
interact? 
</P>
<P>
A. The resale market feeds the new-home market. If the resale market is hot, 
then the new-home market will be hot. And the resale market gets hot based on 
the amount of equity people have in their homes. The resale market is generally 
-- aside from what went on last year -- not as hot in an area where there are a 
lot of new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Which price ranges are selling best in Orange County this year? 
</P>
<P>
A. In the first half of 1988, there were 1,383 homes sold priced over $300,000, 
and that was 21% of total sales. For 1989, there were 1,561 homes sold over 
$300,000, which was 36.6% of all sales. That indicates a lot of movement in 
that price range. In houses priced over $400,000, this year there were 1,077 
sold, 25.3% of the total. Over $450,000, it was 740 sold, or 17.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who's buying these days with prices such as these? 
</P>
<P>
A. The biggest category of buyer is the yuppie buyer. Some of them have delayed 
buying homes because they didn't have children and were spending a lot of their 
time making money. But now they're having kids and looking for houses. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that in 1988, we blew through so many price ranges in the market 
for detached houses that suddenly a market void opened between $150,000 and 
$200,000. There was nothing in that price range. People who had bought small 
condominiums, for instance, and planned to eventually buy a house suddenly 
found that they would probably never be able to afford a detached home. So we 
saw this huge market gap opening, and we advised our clients who build attached 
housing to scrap their plans for small and inexpensive condominiums for the 
first-time home buyer and start thinking about building attached housing for 
growing families -- units with family rooms, that sort of thing, for people who 
already had children or with a child on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of price range are we talking about? 
</P>
<P>
A. Still $150,000 to $200,000, because there was literally nothing in that 
range for a while. Now there are a lot of condos in that range coming on line 
in places like Aliso Viejo. But it's a different type of product than might 
have been originally contemplated by the builders. 
</P>
<P>
There's been a lot of sticker shock in the sense that people who were planning 
to maybe spend $225,000 for their first detached house have found that amount 
buys them an attached unit now. A nice unit, mind you, but an attached one 
nevertheless. Now all of a sudden if you want to stay in Orange County -- even 
a dual-income family making a respectable income -- your only option is 
attached housing. 
</P>
<P>
If you're thinking of a detached house, you may have to think about 
Victorville, because you may even be priced out of Fontana. What nobody had 
anticipated happening has happened, and will continue to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Couldn't Orange County builders construct denser and less expensive housing 
for some of these people? They are now stuck with commuting to work from places 
such as Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
A. We don't have anything with three or four stories built over parking, with 
40 units to the acre, that's for sale. People will accept that kind of density 
in apartments a long time before they'll accept it in for-sale homes, because 
people think of apartments as a temporary thing while you're getting ready to 
buy. But when people find out they're absolutely priced out of the market, then 
they will accept it. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of projects in planning that are going to be like this. And 
people will struggle mightily not to accept them. But then when it comes to 
commuting from San Bernardino or Riverside county and spending hours in 
traffic, as opposed to driving 20 minutes to your job every day from a very 
nice attached housing project, then they'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Even then, won't it be difficult to wean people from the dream of a detached 
house on their own plot of land? 
</P>
<P>
A. Older cultures have already evolved highly dense living situations, as in 
Asian and European cities. 
</P>
<P>
California is a young culture. According to the 1980 census, there were 54 
people per square kilometer in California. There are about 1,500 in Japan. 
Attached housing of any type really only began to be accepted in Orange County 
in 1985. And then in 1987, when interest rates went down and land prices went 
up, this rapid escalation in home prices began and people had to accept condos. 
</P>
<P>
But you have to consider that this market's had only four years in which to 
adjust to a form of living that we thought we'd never have to adjust to, and 
now people simply don't have any choice. We're speedily adapting, in fact. 
That's what the 1990s are going to be about. They're going to be about the 
acceptance of housing types we've never had to consider before. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Could one assume, then, that condominiums are selling well now? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Right now only about 60% of the homes sold in the county are detached. 
But that's a big change from just a few years ago, when it was maybe 90%. The 
condos' 40% will go up increasingly until it hits a balance and then tips over 
to become the majority of housing built in the county. That will probably 
happen by the end of the 1990s in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the lowest price for a single-family house in Orange County these 
days? 
</P>
<P>
A. In south county, the floor of the market begins at $200,000. There were just 
a handful priced between $175,000 and $200,000. So the market really begins at 
$200,000, and that's not going to last very long because we're running out of 
product. That's also happening in the $225,000-to-$250,000 range. The market is 
presently defined by the $450,000-and-up category. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the average price of a new house in the county now? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's now $388,556 in the south county, as of the second quarter. And in the 
north county it's even more expensive because so little housing is being built 
there (most of the land is already developed). The floor of the market is 
$225,000, and that's rapidly going out. The average price in north county is 
$406,832. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where is most of the building that is going on in the northern part of the 
county? 
</P>
<P>
A. To date, the predominant area has been both sides of the Santa Ana Canyon 
area -- Anaheim Hills on one side and Yorba Linda on the other, going out 
toward Corona. But now the hills in back of Fullerton and Brea that had been 
owned by the oil companies are beginning to be developed. There are three 
master-planned communities with golf courses planned for the hills, that I know 
of. I'd imagine those would be very high-priced communities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are we going to end up building on every square inch of Orange County? 
Builders seem to be putting up houses in places that people could not have 
imagined being developed 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A. Everybody says the developers are raping the land and paving over Orange 
County, but they couldn't do that if there was no demand. So something's 
driving all that construction, and it's people's desire for a home. I take some 
offense at the notion that this is all the builders' fault. It's not. You can't 
build homes if nobody wants to buy them. And with that, they also build schools 
and roads and shopping centers. They haven't built all this in a void, and 
they're not out there doing it for fun; there's a demand for it. 
</P>
<P>
I sympathize with people who want to blame their frustrations with things like 
traffic on the people who are most visible, because that's human nature. But I 
can't condone it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can't some of the blame be shared by local governments, who in some cases 
allowed pell-mell growth? What sort of job, for instance, do you think county 
government has done in the south county? 
</P>
<P>
A. Very bad. But people in the county Planning Department were saying 20 years 
ago we have to do certain things, get certain tax increases, to manage the 
growth that was coming. So it wasn't as though nobody was thinking about this 
or hadn't realized it. But then, when it came time for people to approve a 
sales tax to build roads, the voters said no. And then Sacramento didn't give 
us the money we needed for new freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Which south county areas are seeing the most construction? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, they're getting ready to build at the Irvine Coast. Coto de Caza is 
busy, and so's Dove Canyon right next door. There are plans for Trabuco Canyon. 
A lot of the older cities are starting to redevelop, too. Things are generally 
moving east because we're running out of room along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who among the local builders is doing really well? 
</P>
<P>
A. The five biggest builder-developers in Orange County last year were the 
William Lyon Co., with 882 units sold and an 8% market share; the Bren Co., 682 
units and 6%; J.M. Peters, 552 and 5%; S&amp;S Construction sold 498 and had 
4.4%, and Standard Pacific sold 471 and had 4%. None of them, by the way, are 
our clients. They're big enough to do market research in-house. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You mentioned builder-developers. Are a lot of local builders becoming land 
developers as well? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's essential these days. You can only play the game if you have land to 
trade, because land is so scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say you're trying to get some land to build on at somebody else's 
master-planned community. They may very well tell you you're a fine builder 
with a good reputation, but if you don't have some lots for them to build on in 
the future, why should they let you build on their land now? And if you don't 
have a big equity partner standing behind you, somebody who'll permit you to 
buy land so you can trade land, you're going to be out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Land is so expensive that builders are constructing increasingly larger 
houses on increasingly smaller lots. It is not likely that that will change in 
the future, is it? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, it won't change, if for no other reason than tax reform is pushing 
people's money into bigger houses. Most people, even builders, don't think 
there's anything particularly wonderful about looking down a street and seeing 
a canyon of garages. But the architects have found some pretty good ways to 
make that kind of density work. For one thing, the space is going up, with high 
ceilings and that sort of thing that create a lot of volume and light. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is going to happen in the next few years? 
</P>
<P>
A. Assuming the economy remains strong, we'll continue to sell 11,000 to 12,000 
houses a year. The ratio of attached housing to detached will continue to shift 
upward. There'll be more in-fill development in central and north county, 
mixed-use projects melding retail and housing. And people will start to live 
closer to where they work. There's something about looking out your window at 
the office building you just left that's not terribly appealing, but I think 
people will start to value a 10- or 20-minute drive to work over a commute 
that's become impossible.

ACCENT IS ON THE NON-TRADITIONAL FOR O.C. CENTER'S BROADWAY SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Non-traditional productions will highlight the 1989-90 Broadway series at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Starlight Express," which features singing 
roller-skaters, and Tim Rice's "Chess," with a score by members of the pop 
group ABBA, will be among the five Center offerings. "Starlight Express" will 
run April 3 through 8; the dates for "Chess," in June, will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
The series will open Nov. 7 with "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: A Concert," 
a program of excerpts from eight of the composer's hits, which will give 
Southland audiences their "first look at 'Aspects of Love,' " Lloyd Webber's 
latest London success, according to Center President Thomas R. Kendrick. The 
program will feature Sarah Brightman, Lloyd Webber's wife, for whom he wrote 
the part of Christine Daae in "Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick acknowledged that "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber" is "not a musical 
but rather a theatrical concert. This is not musical theater in the traditional 
sense, but Andrew Lloyd Webber is one of the leading composers of musicals of 
our time. He is the most prolific and most successful of our time. He redefined 
the kinds of musicals being presented. He is a man of enormous stature." 
</P>
<P>
There'll be at least one show for the traditionalists, Rodgers and 
Hammerstein's "The King and I." Still, the casting for it will be something 
other than ordinary, with ballet superstar Rudolf Nureyev venturing a singing 
role, his first, as the King. 
</P>
<P>
And for sentimentalists, there will be a revival of Jerry Bock and Sheldon 
Harnick's 1963 romantic comedy "She Loves Me" in a new staging by Paul Drake, 
the original director. Bock and Harnick later created "Fiddler on the Roof." 
</P>
<P>
"The range of the series, we feel, is very good," Kendrick said Friday. 
"Musicals are in very short supply. This is an effort to get what there is of 
value up and going." 
</P>
<P>
For "Starlight Express," in which the skaters will crisscross tracks and 
bridges, a platform will have to be built out into the theater, Kendrick said. 
"We will lose some seats," he noted. The Center is considering extending the 
run into a second week, "but that's not at all nailed down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway series is the Center's most popular, usually attracting between 
17,000 and 20,000 subscribers, Kendrick said. The Center is producing the 
series in partnership with PACE Theatrical Group, a producer of nationally 
touring shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the highest subscriptions on the PACE national circuit," Kendrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Series ticket prices will range from $90.50 to $195; tickets will go on sale in 
mid September. Tickets to the individual shows will be available four to six 
weeks before the start of each engagement. Information is available at (714) 
556-2787. 
</P>
<P>
The series: 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 7 through 12: "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: A Concert," starring 
Sarah Brightman. 
</P>
<P>
* Dec. 5 through 10: Rodgers and Hammerstein's "The King and I," with Rudolf 
Nureyev as the King and Liz Robertson as Anna. Robertson played Eliza Doolittle 
in Cameron Mackintosh's London production of "My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
* Jan. 23 through 28, 1990: Jerry Bock and Sheldon's Harnick's "She Loves Me," 
with Pam Dawber of the television shows "Mork and Mindy" and "My Sister Sam," 
and Joel Higgins of TV's "Silver Spoons." 
</P>
<P>
* April 3 through 8: "Starlight Express." 
</P>
<P>
* June, 1990 (dates to be announced): "Chess," with lyrics by Tim Rice, who did 
"Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Evita," and music by Benny Anderson and Bjorn 
Ulvaeus of the Swedish pop group ABBA.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'CNN NEWSROOM,' 'CHANNEL ONE' STRIVE TO MAKE THE GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television news in the classroom? 
</P>
<P>
It's a fine idea if made relevant and executed with care and vision. 
</P>
<P>
Cable News Network appears to have done just that with "CNN Newsroom," its 
weekday newscast for schoolkids that premiered in this morning's wee hours, 
available for window-shopping by teachers who may want to regularly tape it and 
show it to their students when school resumes next month. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a preview tape, the decidedly unflashy "CNN Newsroom" is vastly 
worthier than "Channel One," the controversial Whittle Communications newscast 
that played like an extended music video when introduced in a five-week trial 
in selected schools last spring. Tennesee-based Whittle says the same format 
will apply for a full-blown national launching scheduled for March. 
</P>
<P>
In September, CNN hopes to have its newscast in 1,000 schools, the same number 
targeted by Whittle for next year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cable's TV-in-the-classroom landscape will expand even further with 
the Aug. 21 start of "Short Subjects," 10-minute C-SPAN vignettes on the 
government and topical issues, airing at 10 p.m. Mondays and designed for use 
by high schools and colleges. And coming Sept. 18 is the Discovery Channel's 
"Assignment: Discovery," weekday curriculum supplements of 20-25 minutes in 
science, social studies and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The C-SPAN and Discovery offerings bear monitoring. However, the battle to 
watch is between the 15-minute, commercial-free "CNN Newsroom," which must be 
taped off the air by schools or teachers at 12:45 a.m., and the 12-minute, 
commercial-fraught "Channel One," which will be beamed by satellite directly 
into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Under Whittle's original plan, schools would receive $50,000 in electronic gear 
only if they agreed to show "Channel One" to all their students, thereby 
exposing an entire student body to the commercials. However, that requirement 
has since been dropped by Whittle. 
</P>
<P>
Far more than "Channel One," "CNN Newsroom" appears to be an excellent 
opportunity to make education more meaningful by turning on junior and senior 
high school kids to current affairs related to their school work. With this 
newscast, CNN has an opportunity to provide a sterling public service and, as a 
bonus, invest in its own future by accustoming young viewers to watch CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program is offered free, CNN says there is a charge of as much as 
$1 a day for a daily curriculum guide for teachers that will be furnished 
schools electronically upon request. 
</P>
<P>
CNN has added "CNN Newsroom" to the duties of Jay Suber, executive producer of 
the network's "This Week in Review." Fronted by fresh young co-anchors Brian 
Todd and Cassandra Henderson, the new program seems understaffed with only two 
reporters of its own. Their stories will air with pieces from CNN's regular 
newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 stories on the preview tape (which, CNN emphasized, was no more than a 
"rehearsal") ranged from brief headlines to three minutes on the impact of AIDS 
on teen-agers. Three other stories ran two to three minutes -- pretty hefty for 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN Newsroom" is at once professional and, unlike "Channel One," appealingly 
unglossy and free of celebrity narrators, thumping music, blinding graphics and 
blazing neon brightness. And, of course, there are no commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of four 30-second commercials per newscast is what has made 
"Channel One" controversial and led to its condemnation by Bill Honig, 
superintendent of public instruction in California, where Gahr High School in 
Cerritos was one of six schools nationwide that participated in the "Channel 
One" pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing others objecting to commercials beamed into classrooms, Honig dismissed 
"Channel One" as "forced commercialization in school" and vowed that any 
California schools airing "Channel One" in the future would be docked state 
funding in accordance with the time students spent viewing the newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Right decision, wrong reason. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials aren't what's wrong with "Channel One." On the contrary, 
they're valuable. They should be studied in class, with students encouraged to 
dissect and analyze them to better understand the sophisticated selling 
techniques they employ. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with "Channel One" is not commercials, only that it resembles the 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The most depressing element of the "Channel One" controversy is that so many 
teachers publicly have expressed their support of the newscast. They've been 
watching too much TV. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently what we are seeing is the impact of one TV generation educating 
another, one set of fried minds imposing their own TV-distorted perceptions on 
a younger set of minds, teachers feeling it is fine for their students to watch 
news that you can dance to. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between "CNN Newsroom" and "Channel One" amount to more than 
just a few jeans and candy commercials. The differences amount to an entire 
philosophy of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials are longer than most of the stories on "Channel One," which 
teaches students that news is indigestible unless accompanied by such TVisms as 
"exclusive" and a fast track of grinding music, horns, flashes and catchy 
titles from "Flash Back" to "Fast Fact" to "Pop Quiz." 
</P>
<P>
Anchor Lynn Blades: "OK, pop quiz: What major feature did Henry Ford leave out 
of his first automobile?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer: reverse gear. 
</P>
<P>
OK, pop quiz: What major feature did Whittle leave out of "Channel One"? 
</P>
<P>
The answer: intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN Newsroom" promises a better future.

TRIUMPHANT HOMECOMING FOR KATE TAMARKIN AT MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If conducting is still one of the last male bastions, Kate Tamarkin is sure to 
help storm the ramparts. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, she led the Pacific Symphony in its third summer concert at the 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. It was a triumphant homecoming for the Laguna 
Beach native after 10 years of studies and engagements away from the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening strains of Berlioz's "Roman Carnival" Overture to the finale 
of Stravinsky's 1919 "Firebird" Suite, Tamarkin demanded precision, and her 
players responded with clean, balanced lines. 
</P>
<P>
At times when passion might have ruled, Tamarkin's interpretations did not 
stress overt sensuality. In the Berlioz piece, the amorous melody -- engagingly 
introduced by Leanne Becknell on English horn -- emphasized an easily unfolding 
grace. Even Stravinsky did not tempt Tamarkin; in "The Princesses' Round," 
woodwinds and horn passed plaintive lines among themselves in unhurried and 
shimmeringly clear ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
But logic and clarity do not preclude excitement. Under Tamarkin's direction 
the orchestra made sense out of the wilder sections of "Firebird" -- the 
Infernal Dance and the Finale -- but biting rhythmic propulsion insured 
electrifying energy as well. 
</P>
<P>
While the Pacific Symphony's guest conductor may have sidestepped chances to 
tug at the heartstrings, violinist Elmar Oliveira ventured to leave no heart 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
True, Mendelssohn's E-minor Concerto is so popular that it is by now hard to 
bring fresh ideas to this much-programmed piece. Instead, Oliveira succumbed to 
the siren of overly serious hokem, seizing every sigh with a loving caress in 
the opening movement, saved only by the performer's ability to impart a sense 
of intensity to his work. 
</P>
<P>
Even intensity could not save the second movement. Oliveira brought a serious 
but unenlightening approach to the Andante, ultimately failing to find a 
definitive direction. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, find his footing in a rather fast final movement, which does 
not require profound interpretive perspicacity -- nimbleness and a knack for 
fun will do. Oliveira provided ample gaiety. And Tamarkin led his orchestral 
partners with a clarity that characterized the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance on this evening was reportedly 1,500 greater than at the third 
concert of last summer's series. If the screams that greeted Tamarkin's 
entrance were any indication, at least some of the 6,587 had come to offer a 
welcome to a returning friend.

COX EXHIBIT ACTS AS BRIDGE FOR LAGUNA ART MUSEUM

<P>
A sure-fire way to make the atmosphere crackle is to ask a bunch of artists how 
much attention they get from their friendly local art museum. 
</P>
<P>
If that institution has any pretentions at all, it will attempt to seek out the 
highest-quality art available. Even in a major metropolitan center, that means 
choosing only the cream of the art produced locally. And in a smaller town -- 
where "local" may more likely mean "provincial" or "run-of-the-mill" -- it may 
be hard to find work that really shines. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, to be sure, a prejudice against the local product is exactly that -- 
a failure of nerve in the face of work ignored by the art establishment. 
Conversely, a museum is no more obliged to cater to the wishes of the artists 
in town than it is to those of local collectors. By exposing everyone -- 
including local artists -- to a broad range of significant work, a museum is 
best fulfilling its educational function for the community. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, resident artists by and large know better than to expect to 
be shown at Newport Harbor Art Museum. In recent years, only a handful of 
county artists (none of whom, it appears, actually lives in Newport Beach) have 
been among the elect. This group includes conceptual artist Nick Vaughn, 
painter Don Karwelis and (in the current exhibit of photographs from the 
collection) Jerry Burchfield, Laurie Brown, H. Arthur Taussig and Martha 
Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
But the Laguna Art Museum -- founded by a group of Laguna artists and located 
in a town teeming with people who consider themselves artists of one stripe or 
another -- traditionally has been very hospitable to art produced locally. Now 
that the museum is striving for a sharper profile, however, the issue is 
trickier. How do you find enough work that's "local" but also up to the 
standards of the imported shows that have become the museum's mainstay? 
</P>
<P>
The most recent answer to that question is "Kris Cox: Sculpture and Paintings," 
an exhibit that continues through Oct. 22. It presents the work of an artist 
who lived in Laguna Beach for 12 years before moving to Los Angeles this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ceramics do continue to occupy a sort of netherworld in the pecking order of 
art. The old distinctions between craft and fine art die hard, and indeed, much 
work in the clay medium does lean toward the decorative and insubstantial. But 
the choice of Cox seems a reasonable, if not wildly exciting, bridge between 
the town's longstanding emphasis on crafts and the museum's attempt to nudge 
its viewers toward a more adventurous vision of art. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cox's wife, Elaine Dines-Cox, has guest curated several exhibits at 
the museum, only a holier-than-thou observer would cry foul, given the tiny, 
hopelessly overlapping world of the arts. Besides, Cox's work has been fairly 
widely exhibited in Southern California, including a 1986 ceramic show at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
A master of fine art graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, Cox started 
out as a traditional potter and evolved a more personal, sculptural treatment 
of the medium. A group of vessels from the early '80s offers gentle variations 
on familiar shapes, cracked surfaces that suggest the texture of dried mud and 
occasional bursts of incised markings that resemble calligraphy. This is 
attractive stuff, but it's still in the mute category of decorative object 
rather than the voluble one of art. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, in his "Sanctum" series, Cox invested vessel forms with 
architectural features: towers and lookouts, scaffoldings and niches. These 
give the pieces the air of projects hacked into forbidding terrain by 
civilizations at once futuristic and medieval. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of rough-and-ready bulk, delicate engineering and imaginative 
vision displayed in these works boosts them head-and-shoulders above the run of 
ceramics that wish they were sculptures. You get the idea that if Cox weren't 
working in ceramics, he'd be out in the garage, tinkering with a new gadget, or 
in the study, reading up on ancient cultures. Unfortunately, none of the other 
works on view lives up to this standard. 
</P>
<P>
In his wall-hung "Sentinel" series, painted and gouged ceramic tablets are 
fitted into scaffolding-like frameworks. One piece resembles a bizarre marriage 
of a crossbow, a pickax and a sled; still another takes the shape of a boat. 
But they seem underdeveloped, without the adventurous edge that marks the fully 
three-dimensional sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Also disappointing is the "Morpheus" series, which (as Peter Frank notes in his 
catalogue essay) resembles heads of dressmakers' dummies or helmets. You'd 
think that the "head" motif would offer opportunities for statements about the 
mysterious ways of the human mind, isolation in a dehumanized era or some other 
thoughtful topic. Yet these sculptures -- made of steel and hydrastone (a 
clay-like substance) -- don't seem to offer much more than careful craft. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Cox gets to evoking a more substantial image is in "Constantin," a 
gyroscopelike cage enclosing an oval solid lying on its side, somewhat 
reminiscent of the colossal ancient head of the early Christian emperor 
Constantine the Great. 
</P>
<P>
Cox's most recent projects are mixed-media paintings. In most of these, a 
roomlike space holds an immense object contoured like a child's top. In "Red 
Alcove," this form takes on a humanoid form with a menacing, muscle-bound 
appearance and a helmeted head suggestive of Alexandre Dumas' Man in the Iron 
Mask or a creature out of a comic book. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, though, the object-in-the-room idea isn't terribly compelling. The 
steady patter of gouges and vague, incised "drawings" that skitters over these 
paintings seems to be a tacit acknowledgement that not enough is going on here. 
But textural "interest" doesn't seem to be the solution. It looks like time to 
start puttering again. 
</P>
<P>
Also showing in the museum (to Oct. 1) are manipulated photographs by Los 
Angeles artist Judy Coleman. Using a Polaroid of her nude body as a working 
surface, she paints on it with oil and wax, draws on it with graphite and 
scratches it with sandpaper and steel wool. Then she re-photographs the 
finished piece and blows up the 8-by-10-inch negative to make the large 
finished work. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting images make her body look as though it is suspended in fog or 
washed over by heavy rain or consumed by fire. The viewer doesn't register the 
nakedness of the figure -- which is largely obscured, anyway -- so much as its 
untethered, helpless state. 
</P>
<P>
"This has a gothic quality," a gallery visitor remarked the other day, looking 
at Coleman's photograph "Maelstrom," in which her small, glowing body arrows 
like a comet through a murky void pockmarked with big watery splotches. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most of Coleman's dreamscapes convey the notion of female submission to 
raging forces beyond her control, a way of life that is the lifeblood of gothic 
fiction. Coleman herself views her photographed alter egos as simply "riding 
out some psychological moment." Well, it isn't the first time artist and viewer 
have differed about the content of a work of art. But perhaps elemental 
figurative work like this is particularly likely to call up highly subjective 
feelings about control and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
It would be interesting to get a perspective on this subject from a 
psychologist. Any volunteers? 
</P>
<P>
 "Kris Cox: Sculpture and Paintings" (to Oct. 22) and photographs by Judy 
Coleman (to Oct. 1) are at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive in Laguna 
Beach. Hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission is $2 
general, $1 for students and seniors, free for children under 12. Information:

Most of the 13 people on a hot-air balloon that collided with another over the 
Australian outback locked arms before plummeting 2,000 feet to their death, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
An aviation expert called Sunday's accident the worst ballooning tragedy in the 
206-year history of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were 11 Australians, an Italian and a Dane, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred after the balloon, one of four on a sightseeing trip, 
rose quickly under a second one, struck it, then started to shake, said Irene 
Fielder of West Germany, who was on her first balloon ride when she witnessed 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said three of the victims apparently tried to save themselves by 
jumping out at the moment of impact. The other 10 were found huddled, arms 
linked, in the woven basket attached to the canopy.

Four Israeli tax collectors were wounded today when a Molotov cocktail smashed 
through a car windshield and burst into flames in the town of Ramallah on the 
occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the attack, the military clamped curfews on the area and a 
nearby Palestinian refugee camp and detained dozens of Arabs for questioning. 
Soldiers also ordered Palestine Street, where the attack occurred, shops along 
the road and adjacent alleys closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the attack was directed at the Israeli-licensed car or 
the tax collectors.

Stones, empty bottles and gasoline bombs against Israeli vehicles and soldiers

LANCASTER WOMAN PULLED FROM FIRE

<P>
Two neighbors who found an elderly Lancaster woman standing in a daze in her 
burning apartment and pulled her to safety probably saved her life, 
firefighters said today. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Mae Ray, 68, was in stable condition at Lancaster Community Hospital, 
where she was treated for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Sammy Ramos, 44, and Ray Valencia, 46, acted quickly at about 5 p.m. 
Sunday when they saw smoke pouring from Ray's apartment in a single-story 
duplex in the 45000 block of North Fig Street. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia used a garden hose to fight the flames while Ramos made his way 
through the smoke and found Ray standing near the fire, which was apparently 
caused by a cigarette left burning on a coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was cooking pretty good," Ramos said. "She was very confused, kind of 
disoriented. I grabbed her by both arms, turned her around and just kind of 
walked her out." 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused about $45,000 damage, firefighters said.

GARDEN GROVE MAN ESCAPES SERIOUS INJURIES IN FIERY TRUCK ACCIDENT

A Garden Grove man escaped serious injuries early this morning when the truck 
he was driving at a high speed went out of control and broke apart before 
bursting into flames, Buena Park police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry H. Herrera, 52, was thrown from his tractor-trailer near of La Palma and 
La Costa avenues, Police Lt. Gary Hicken said. 
</P>
<P>
"He apparently fell asleep," Hicken said before the truck hit a palm tree and 
flew into the air shortly before 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators estimated that Herrera had been driving the truck along 
city streets in excess of 80 m.p.h. A test revealed that there was no alcohol 
in Herrera's bloodstream, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Richard McMillen said the destruction resembled the aftermath of a 
plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, who was found in a clump of nearby bushes, had a broken left arm and 
was taken to UCI-Medical Center in Orange, said hospital spokeswoman Fran 
Tardiff.

S. AFRICA'S BOTHA RESIGNS, CASTIGATES HEIR APPARENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Pieter W. Botha, president of South Africa for nearly 11 years, announced his 
resignation today after a bitter dispute with heir-apparent Frederik W. de 
Klerk, leader of the ruling white National Party. 
</P>
<P>
Botha, 73, again castigated De Klerk for planning talks with Zambian President 
Kenneth Kaunda without consulting him. "I shall not approve a visit to Dr. 
Kaunda . . . at this stage," he said in a nationally televised address. 
</P>
<P>
Botha said members of his Cabinet asked him to resign during a 2 1/2-hour 
meeting at his Cape Town office today, suggesting he give ill health as a 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
"To this, I replied that I am not prepared to leave on a lie, and I have 
consequently decided to submit my resignation to the chief justice today with 
effect from Aug. 15, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Botha did not nominate a successor, but party sources said De Klerk, 53, will 
be sworn in Tuesday as acting president until after parliamentary elections 
Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was nominated by his party in February to succeed Botha, who was 
forced at the time to not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Botha left his office at 5:25 p.m., waving from his silver limousine to a 
handful of reporters gathered outside. A policeman lowered his personal flag. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation address included a blow-by-blow account of the dispute that led 
to his bitter farewell. 
</P>
<P>
He said in his television address that he had twice had trouble with De Klerk 
making policy announcements or planning foreign travel without seeking his 
approval as required by Cabinet rules. 
</P>
<P>
"After all these years of my best efforts for the National Party and for the 
government of this country, as well as the security of our country, I am being 
ignored by ministers serving in my Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"I consequently have no choice other than to announce my resignation," Botha 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Botha resigned the party leadership after he suffered a mild stroke in January 
but made it clear he wanted to stay on as president. 
</P>
<P>
Party sources said he was surprised and angry when De Klerk and not Finance 
Minister Barend du Plessis was elected in his place and when he came under 
intense pressure to surrender the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Botha never publicly congratulated De Klerk, and he forced party officials to 
cancel a farewell banquet for him at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
The party revolt erupted anew over the weekend after Botha publicly repudiated 
a statement by Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha saying that the president 
had approved the talks with Kaunda. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk summoned Cabinet colleagues to his home in Pretoria on Saturday and 
met them again for an hour after today's Cabinet session with Botha. 
</P>
<P>
The party leaders refused to disclose the outcome of the meeting with Botha, 
but Justice Minister Hendrik J. Coetsee said it was very dignified.

Family members of the U.S. Embassy staff returned for an emotional reunion 
today, more than two months after their diplomatic housing compound came under 
Chinese artillery fire and they were forced to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador James Lilley and staff members waving American flags and 
clutching bunches of flowers waited in the arrival lounge of Beijing Airport 
for a United Airlines flight from Tokyo carrying the first 31 dependents of 260 
relatives returning to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," Lilley said as he rushed to meet his wife, Sally, and their 
dachshund Jo-Jo. "Our people should be with their families. We've got to get on 
with life here." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, which evacuated dependents of embassy staff in the wake 
of the June 7 shooting incident, last week modified a blanket advisory against 
travel to China that effectively allowed the family members to return. 
</P>
<P>
Lilley said, however, that the warning on "non-essential" travel to China will 
stay in effect "as long as there are soldiers running around with guns." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese troops still guard key intersections and set up checkpoints at night, 
apparently searching for weapons lost during the military crackdown on the 
student-led democracy movement.

Three-fourths of all teen-agers and nearly half of all adults are ready to 
volunteer time to drug prevention programs, education and treatment, and nine 
in 10 Americans want tougher anti-drug laws, a Gallup poll showed today. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people are in a wartime mood," George Gallup said at a White 
House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
William Bennett, the national drug control director who will make the Bush 
Administration's policy public early next month, said, "The American people 
have given a very clear sense of direction to us" in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is ready to take action on all fronts," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that drug abuse was listed by 32% of teen-agers as the most 
important problem facing the country, ahead of fear of war, 14%; economic 
issues, 13%; environment and pollution, 7%; AIDS, 5%; crime, 3%, and abortion, 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he does not want to disclose the Administration's policy 
prematurely but said, "If there is a subtitle to our strategy, it is everybody 
plays. Everybody must do something."

International Business Machines Corp. said today that it is introducing a 
medical instrument that uses 24 tiny superconductors to detect changes in the 
brain's magnetic field for use in diagnosing epilepsy, stroke and deafness. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said the new instrument, called a magnetometer, is about four times more 
effective at recording the brain's weak magnetic signals than previous 
experimental models and could be used to chart complex brain function pathways. 
The machine uses 24 detection channels to detect magnetic fields in the brain 
that are about 1 billion times weaker than Earth's magnetic field, the company 
said.

<P>
President Bush today nominated Richard C. Breeden, the White House point man on 
landmark savings and loan legislation, to head the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The post requires Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater all but confirmed Breeden's 
selection. "Let's say that Mr. Breeden is an outstanding candidate, and I don't 
know that we have an announcement on it today, but we expect to soon," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden, 39, a lawyer and banking specialist, would succeed David S. Ruder, who 
announced in May that he intended to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden helped write President Bush's plan for bailing out the nation's ailing 
savings and loan industry and represented the White House in dealings with 
Congress as that legislation progressed through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The final plan, a major restructuring of federal banking laws and the largest 
single-industry government bailout in history, took effect with Bush's 
signature last week. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden, whose job as presidential assistant for issues analysis made him 
something of a White House trouble-shooter, also helped fashion Administration 
policy for dealing with the Alaska oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
From 1982 to 1985, Breeden was deputy counsel to then-Vice President Bush. He 
went to the White House after four years in private practice as a banking 
specialist in the Washington office of a Houston law firm. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC is a five-member board that oversees securities markets, regulates the 
sale of stocks, bonds and stock options and enforces securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Ruder, an appointee of Ronald Reagan, has been chairman of the regulatory body 
since Aug. 7, 1987, about 2 1/2 months before the stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
He announced last May that he wanted to step down and would stay on until a 
successor is selected. Ruder plans to return to Northwestern University Law 
School, where he formerly taught. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden's nomination was not expected to run into any difficulties in the 
Senate, where he is reportedly well respected.

South Korea plans to melt down $13 million worth of unsold coins commemorating 
the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Kyonghyang Daily News, a Seoul newspaper, said the Bank of Korea was 
arranging with a Korean firm to melt down about 2.5 million unsold Olympic 
coins whose value was estimated at $13 million. The newspaper accused Olympic 
organizers and bank officials of poor promotion and a half-hearted attitude in 
selling the coins. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic coins were first issued in February, 1987, and the central bank had to 
re-issue the coins four times last year to meet a growing demand. But the 
demand fell off sharply in the months after last year's summer games.

The Yugoslav army's drafting of Los Angeles Lakers Vlade Divac has the San 
Antonio Spurs a bit concerned about what will happen to their own player from 
that nation, Zarko Paspalj. 
</P>
<P>
Both Divac and Paspalj starred on the Yugoslav national team. The Lakers signed 
Divac, who has been ordered to report to active military duty by Sept. 19. The 
Spurs signed Paspalj to a two-year contract on July 27. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we're concerned," Spurs President Gary Woods said. "We've always known 
that Yugoslavia could draft the players into the army. 
</P>
<P>
"The players get a deferment from military service if they are playing in their 
own country, but we've been aware that they could be put into the service if 
they left the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavs are obligated to serve one year in the army and are eligible to be 
drafted until age 28. Paspalj is 23. 
</P>
<P>
Paspalj has been working with the Yugoslav consulate in Chicago to complete the 
necessary paper work to obtain a deferment from military obligation. He says he 
is not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is not a problem," Paspalj said. "I must do my military service, 
but I can do it in three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a problem for any of us (Yugoslav players in the United 
States). I think it is mostly a reporter's story. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Vlade (Saturday) night, and he said it is not true. He says he 
will serve in the army but not for a few years. He will play for the Lakers."

Edwards, who has pleaded innocent to two misdemeanor battery charges, is

A Sept. 18 trial date has been set for the cocaine trafficking case of 
Cleveland Browns running back Kevin Mack, his defense attorney, Gerald Golden, 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, 26, was arrested June 28 in his car at a Cleveland street corner. He was 
indicted by a Cuyahoga County grand jury July 10 on one felony count each of 
cocaine possession, cocaine trafficking, possession of criminal tools and using 
a motor vehicle for drug abuse. If convicted on all counts, Mack could face up 
to 20 years in prison. He remains free on $2,500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Mack recently finished a monthlong drug rehabilitation program at the Cleveland 
Clinic and traveled with the Browns to London for an exhibition game against 
the Philadelphia Eagles on Aug. 6. He did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Golden has said he is uncertain whether Mack would face sanctions from the NFL 
or the Browns because of his arrest.
