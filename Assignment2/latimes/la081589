Sheriff's report: 
</P>
<P>
"Deputy Allen Sarpy and Richard Clovis were out on patrol when they were told 
by a citizen that an alligator was walking northbound on Clovis Avenue 
approaching the intersection of 130th Street in an unincorporated area of 
Carson. The deputies found the 3 1/2-foot alligator, lassoed him and removed 
him from local surface streets." 
</P>
<P>
The deputies then called Los Angeles County animal control officers, who took 
the reptile into custody. But they discovered that the "alligator" was not an 
alligator at all, but a caiman -- a variety of crocodile, according to Lt. 
George Warfield, of the animal control office. 
</P>
<P>
"And he's only about 2 feet long," Warfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Warfield noted that it is illegal to have caimans as pets in California, so 
animal control officers will turn it over to the state Fish and Game 
Department, which will "try to find a happy home in a zoo for the caiman." 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't work, he said, it will be shipped to Arkansas, where 
authorities will let it loose in the swamps. So far, officials haven't any idea 
how the caiman happened to be out for a morning stroll. 
</P>

Beverly Hills' new Carnegie Deli is starting a "Pickle of the Month Award." The 
cucumbers and dills won't be the honorees, but rather people who get themselves 
embroiled in same, as in "What a Pickle I'm in." In other words, if you're in a 
serious jam, you might relish sharing it with everyone. The deli intends to 
immortalize monthly winners with a window display. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Carnegie's first nominee could be Zsa Zsa Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
If you remember, Zsa Zsa is in a pickle because she allegedly slapped and 
cussed at a Beverly Hills police officer, who pulled her over for having 
expired tags. 
</P>
<P>
Zsa Zsa's recent run-in with Beverly Hills police has spawned a whole new fan 
following for the Hungarian-born actress. 
</P>
<P>
A group called The Society for Prevention of Anything Against Zsa Zsa (SPAAZZ) 
is planning a "moment of silence" for their heroine on her trial date Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Founder Paul Spreadbury of Orlando, Fla., said he wants everybody in Beverly 
Hills to wear "Free Zsa Zsa" T-shirts (which he sells, of course) that day and 
observe a minute of silence for Zsa Zsa at noon that day. 
</P>
<P>
Spreadbury, who says he was never a big fan of Zsa Zsa's before the court 
action, explained: "We've got people who murder and rape and walk away from the 
courtroom and here we are making a case against Zsa Zsa. Something's not quite 
right."

AL MARTINEZ: SHORT AND SWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sally Smith agreed to meet me in the lobby of the Airport Marriott Hotel, 
I asked how I would recognize her. She replied, "I'm fat and I have auburn 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
It was not the kind of response that encouraged further questioning. To have 
asked "How fat?" would have bordered on bad manners. Fat and auburn would have 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, when I reached the Marriott there were several fat women in the 
lobby and, it seemed to me, many of them had auburn hair. 
</P>
<P>
They were at the cashier's counter, the concierge booth, the gift shop, the 
sports store and lined up to get into the restaurant, where a lavish brunch was 
being served. 
</P>
<P>
America's Fat Activists, you see, were in town. 
</P>
<P>
Three-hundred members of the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance had 
gathered at the Marriott for a six-day convention to plan their national 
strategy against "size discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
They are at war with the notion that fatandugly is one word and are attempting 
to radicalize America's 70 million fat people. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no blame in being fat," Sally Smith said. She is executive director 
of NAAFA. "We are fat as a result of genetics and metabolism, not indolence or 
gluttony. 
</P>
<P>
"Forcing us to be thin would be like bleaching black people to make them white. 
We don't have a whole lot of choice either." 
</P>
<P>
By the way, I never did recognize Smith by her description, but she recognized 
me by mine. I am short and proud. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who weighs 300 pounds, says that fighting the stereotypes of sizism 
isn't easy. They are still called fatso, chubby, pudgy, pig and Fatty, fatty 
two-by-four, can't get through the kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer being referred to as fat just as blacks prefer being called black," 
she said. "Overweight implies an arbitrary standard, and obesity sounds like a 
disease. We're fat. Period." 
</P>
<P>
When Smith tries to educate the public on size discrimination, very few take 
the problem seriously. Fat people are jolly and short people are cuddly, so 
what's the big deal? 
</P>
<P>
The big deal is that fat people are being rejected and/or fired from jobs 
because of their size and not their qualifications, Smith says. She wasn't sure 
about short people, because that is not NAAFA's specialty. 
</P>
<P>
"Even worse," Smith said, "we just heard that in Detroit, a woman who weighed 
320 pounds was shot by her father and her sister for being fat and for having 
asthma." 
</P>
<P>
"That seems excessive," I said, for lack of a better response. 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed," Smith said, wondering just how I had intended the comment. 
</P>
<P>
"What I mean is, I wonder whether she was shot for being fat or for having 
asthma?" 
</P>
<P>
Smith ignored the question, and went on to talk about a letter she received 
from a woman whose husband was about to leave her and whose children taunted 
her, all for being fat. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what she weighed?" Smith asked. "A hundred and forty-five pounds! If 
you're not as skinny as a model, you're rejected. Well, not everyone is going 
to look like Cheryl Tiegs!" 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Indeed." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that we're running short of victims. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a raised consciousness, it is no longer acceptable to make fun of 
blacks, Mexicans, gays, Poles, women, drunks, Asians, senior citizens or people 
suffering from various forms of lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
The producers of "A Fish Called Wanda" caught hell because a comic character 
stuttered, and anyone who makes fun of a Jew risks a commando raid out of Tel 
Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves us, as a friend said, with blimps and shrimps. 
</P>
<P>
"Most fat jokes are atrocious," said Bill Fabrey, who founded NAAFA 20 years 
ago. "One of the worst going around is, 'My mother-in-law is fat but she eats 
like a bird . . . a vulture.' Ho, ho, ho." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head. "I got a call one day from a man who collects 'humor.' He 
wanted to sell us 156 fat jokes for $1 each. Can you believe that?" Fabrey, 48, 
isn't fat, but tells people he's "accredited" because he's married to a fat 
person. 
</P>
<P>
He created NAAFA when he began to realize that Fat America had no voice. Today, 
the organization has 2,100 members in 37 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
I, for one, wish the fatties well in their effort to wipe out discrimination 
based on poundage. I doubt that there will come a day in my lifetime when a 
300-pounder will grace the centerfold of Playboy magazine, but I'm a short 
person, so what do I know? 
</P>
<P>
There's a Spanish proverb that says women, melons and cheese ought to be chosen 
by weight, and perhaps that day is in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
At least the fat is in the fire.

TAKING A STAND AGAINST SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Air Resources Board has a long list of sound reasons to approve a 
long-range plan to clean up the air over Southern California. Its questions 
about the plan having been answered, it should vote today to let the region get 
on about its cleanup job without further delay. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was drafted over a period of five years in a joint effort by the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District and the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. It calls for at least 125 new rules and regulations, ranging from 
changes in zoning codes to changes in vehicle fuels over the next 20 years. Its 
goal is to scrub Southern California air clean enough for people to breathe 
without fearing for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Resources Board, which must approve the plan before it goes to the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency, put the plan on hold two months ago 
and asked the agencies to clear up some points. It wanted to know, for example, 
how the district could be sure that cities would do what needed doing to make 
the plan work. It also asked for more details on the way the district plans to 
analyze the social and economic consequences of each new regulation before it 
is adopted. The board also asked what could be done to make businessmen less 
nervous about the plan. The first two answers will be delivered today. The 
third may take the entire 20 years over which the plan will be put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
One part of the answer about cities, for example, is that the plan already has 
made its way through committees and task forces made up of dozens of elected 
city officials who, among them, represent 7 million Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The answer about business will be more difficult. One argument against the plan 
in its present form, advanced by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and 
others, is that the district would analyze the social and economic aspects of 
each new regulation itself. Critics of the plan want an independent analysis. 
</P>
<P>
One difficulty with that is legal. The district, not some independent 
consultant, is responsible for seeing to it that Southern California meets 
clean- air standards. Another is practical. There never has been, nor is there 
likely to be, a single analysis of any proposed air-quality regulation. They 
come in threes, one by the district staff, one by industry to demonstrate that 
the regulation is excessive and one by environmental groups to show that the 
rule is too soft to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
The state board's staff has recommended approval of the plan. The board can 
vouch for half of the smog reductions in the plan because those will come as a 
result of regulations that the state board itself will adopt. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the plan will impose harsh burdens on Southern Californians or force 
drastic changes in the way they live. With these and other sound reasons for 
approval, the board has no more choice in the matter than do Southern 
California's smog controllers who must start putting the plan to work as soon 
as possible.

ARBITRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Binding arbitration for firefighters will be considered by the state 
Legislature later this month -- a measure, that if approved, would permit 
outside arbitrators to make decisions which, in the past, have been reserved 
for local elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of Senate Bill 1127 would allow an arbitrator to decide on 
firefighters' salaries, benefits and working conditions and would destroy the 
collective bargaining process by which Anaheim and its firefighters have 
successfully resolved their differences since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Under a system which includes binding arbitration, the city and the 
firefighters' union could no longer negotiate and compromise in good faith, but 
rather posture themselves for the ultimate binding arbitration hearing. Binding 
arbitration would discourage the development of long-term relationships based 
on mutual trust and good will. 
</P>
<P>
We urge state legislators to let cities and firefighters associations continue 
to work collectively on issues that can be resolved by the parties themselves. 
The local taxpayers should be able to decide their own priorities and budget 
without outside interference.

ART FUNDS AND CENSORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bogosian's defense of NEA against the tirades of Helms misses the point. Much 
of what is funded by the NEA can and should be funded at the local level. But 
California, while second in the nation in the number of artists, ranks only 
20th in state funding of the arts. (See "Hot Line for Writers," Book Review 
Section, Aug. 6.) California taxpayers have the right to wonder why their tax 
dollars should subsidize New York artists. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the question of funding, the NEA has sought to promote the myth of the 
avant-garde, that controversial art and artists can be encouraged with state 
funds. This amounts to moral schizophrenia, an atmosphere in which art is 
supposed to be subversive, but not offensive. Is the public ready for this? 
Well, no, not yet. Bogosian says finally that he would have no career without 
the NEA. Would he still be an artist? If the answer is yes, then he has made it 
in spite of the NEA and should be commended.

ART FUNDS AND CENSORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor and writer Eric Bogosian ("When Politics Campaigns in the Arts, 
Creativity Ends," Opinion, Aug. 6) made a forceful case for getting politics 
out of NEA grants. Alas, he did not go far enough and demand total separation 
of arts and state. 
</P>
<P>
Where did Bogosian go wrong? NEA grants are justified, he wrote, because "we 
voted for people who voted for it." By Bogosian's logic, he then apparently 
thinks a $300- billion defense budget is justified because "we voted for people 
who voted for it." 
</P>
<P>
His greatest fallacy is to beg the question of which "art" and "artists" will 
get endowment money and which will be denied it. Bogosian scorns the idea that 
the "Average Joe," taxed to pay for this, should have any voice in the matter; 
no, this should be left to experts, to the NEA's "jury of peers." Who decides 
who these "peers" are? Political appointees. So politics was helping support 
art that turned the American flag into a floor mat, homoerotic art or an image 
of Christ in a jar of urine. 
</P>
<P>
Where are tax dollars being spent by NEA to support artists whose work 
criticizes the ruling left-liberal Establishment ideology that dominates the 
intellectual and artistic community? 
</P>
<P>
Where is the variety, balance, diversity of views? When one young Chicago 
artist did a painting that poked fun at the city's late liberal mayor, Harold 
Washington, Chicago government officials illegally confiscated his artwork from 
the gallery and destroyed it. No Eric Bogosian spoke up to criticize this 
Nazi-like act of censorship by liberals. 
</P>
<P>
We can call the NEA's cynical leftward political manipulation of the arts many 
things, but let's not pretend that it is healthy for artistic creativity, or 
that it is freedom. NEA's purse strings have become a leash by which artists 
are trained to be good little lackeys for the left. The only way to liberate 
our artists is to end all government involvement in funding or otherwise 
controlling the arts.

A column by Neal Peirce singles out plastic foam polystyrene packaging and 
other nonbiodegradable products as a major cause of our solid waste disposal 
crisis (Op-Ed Page, July 23). 
</P>
<P>
He falls victim to the faddish pseudo-solutions of plastic foam ban advocates, 
not realizing that such a ban would actually worsen the solid waste crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the facts: 
</P>
<P>
The only solution to the landfill crisis is reducing what goes into the 
landfill. And the best way to do this is through recycling. That's why the 
proper use of plastic foam food packaging will help solve the solid waste 
crisis -- because it is the only disposable food service product that can be 
recycled. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the manufacturers of polystyrene foam recently became the first 
industry to develop a national infrastructure for recycling their products. The 
National Polystyrene Recycling Co. has a plant on line in Massachusetts, and 
plans to have four more facilities across the nation operating in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Substitutes for polystyrene, which would have to be used in communities where a 
ban is enacted, cannot be recycled.

CALLS FOR DRUG BOOT CAMPS SOUND A ONE-NOTE THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH SCHOEN, Kenneth Schoen is director of the Justice Program of the 
Edna McConnell Clark Foundation and former corrections commissioner for the 
state of Minnesota. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An emerging tool for throttling the small-time crack dealer is a rigorous 90 
days in a good old-fashioned "boot camp." With drug czar William Bennett in the 
lead, enthusiasts forecast great benefits from these military-style facilities 
that are cropping up across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Boot camps, we are told, give young culprits a strong measure of discipline 
along with the lesson that we are not going to tolerate their activities. A 
dose of shaved heads, push-ups and enforced obedience will deter inmates from 
even thinking about peddling drugs again. They will be shaped up and shipped 
out to join the mainstream of good citizens, sometimes even with new job 
skills. Moreover, boot camps are fast-turnaround programs in which large 
numbers of offenders can be quickly run through the system at a much lower cost 
than in conventional prisons. 
</P>
<P>
If all this were true, boot camps would signal the rebirth of incarceration as 
a rehabilitative tool. For 15 years we have heard that rehabilitation in prison 
was a failed idea and that the explosion in the prison population took place 
simply to get criminals off the streets and deter potential offenders. But boot 
camp is supposed to be different. It's a sort of car wash for criminals -- in 
one quick drive-through, the offender is cleansed of errant leanings and 
redirected toward a productive life. 
</P>
<P>
Another crime-fighting fad caught our attention a few years ago. Every prison 
warden was pushed to replicate a program called Scared Straight. Youngsters 
from school classes would file into the depths of prisons to be verbally 
assaulted by a group of tough-looking, hardened cons. In the rawest of terms, 
kids were told to keep their lives in order or they, too, would end up in the 
mess they saw before them. The program was to be the magic potion that would 
stem our growing delinquency problem. But after a short flurry, it disappeared 
with hardly a trace. The cure for delinquency is too complicated to be scared 
into existence. 
</P>
<P>
The boot camp fad also will pass when it becomes clear that it does little to 
thin the ranks of drug peddlers. With its veneer removed, the boot camp is just 
another version of the one-note theme that has been sounded for the past decade 
as the solution to crime -- a pure, simple-minded and unsuccessful program of 
more and more incarceration. However, rather than disappear like Scared 
Straight, the boot camp facilities will be added to this country's growing 
roster of prisons in which more people will do more time. 
</P>
<P>
The real answer to America's intolerable crime and crack problem is to be found 
by noticing who is in our prisons -- inmates drawn almost exclusively from the 
ranks of the poor, black and Latino. Doing something about the conditions that 
generate this lopsided situation is complicated, but at its most basic level it 
means changing the environments in which the young see graffiti before they see 
beauty, hear gunshots before symphonies and feel despair before hope. 
</P>
<P>
That's a tough order, but we can start by being honest about what does not 
work. Threatening drug sellers with penalties from boot camps to electric 
chairs is to fail to recognize the feebleness of deterrence in the criminal 
justice system. So long as drug dealing can put poor kids in BMWs, the 
humiliating shout of a drill sergeant is short-lived noise. Aggressive 
competitors in the drug trade are far more life-threatening than the specter of 
an electric chair. And the last thing the young drug dealer needs to learn from 
a boot camp encounter is how to be a bigger, better and more macho drug 
merchant.

Shortly after Notre Dame wrapped up college football's 1988 national 
championship, a South Bend, Ind., radio station asked Coach Lou Holtz if he 
would lend his voice to a charity promotional. Holtz said he would. 
</P>
<P>
When Holtz went to the station, he was accompanied by former Irish coach Ara 
Parseghian. Holtz was welcomed at the station by the program director who said, 
"Thanks for coming, Coach Faust." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz didn't flinch. He no doubt wondered how he could be confused with Gerry 
Faust, but he didn't say anything, and they did the promotional. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he was leaving, Holtz called over the station manager and pointed to 
Parseghian. 
</P>
<P>
"By the way," he said, "have you had a chance to meet Frank Leahy?" 
</P>
<P>
Sam's sing: From Coach Sam Wyche, whose Cincinnati Bengals came within seconds 
of winning it all last season: 
</P>
<P>
"What gets me is people come up to me and say, 'Well, I hope you have a better 
season.' Hey, we were 12-4, we won every home game and won more games than any 
team in football last year. And the tragedy is, we could have a better year, a 
better team and still not get back to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Tim Kurkjian of the Baltimore Sun asks this one: "Before this 
year, five players had hit 20 or more homers in each of the last seven years. 
Name them." Hint: You won't even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Chicago sportscaster Johnny Morris, former receiver 
for the Chicago Bears, is a longtime horse racing enthusiast who has a race 
named for him, the Johnny Morris Handicap, at Arlington International. 
</P>
<P>
Said Morris: "I had a natural interest in the sport and when I was with the 
Bears, I used to go to the track all the time with Jim Dooley, who later became 
the Bears' head coach, and a teammate named Angie Coia, from USC. 
</P>
<P>
"George Halas was coaching at the time and he used to say, 'I don't want you 
guys going to the track.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then, about the third time I went, I walked up to the mutuel window to bet and 
who's punching tickets but Frank Halas, George's brother." 
</P>
<P>
Dept. of Irony: Coming out of Michigan State, Kirk Gibson opted for baseball 
rather than risk life and limb as a wide receiver in the National Football 
League. Baseball hasn't been kind, however. Gibson has been on the disabled 
list seven times and never has played a full season. His best was 154 games. 
His average over the last seven seasons was 127 games. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy price: Houston Oiler linebacker Eugene Seales was told to report at 250 
pounds, but came in at 270 and it's costing him. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Jerry Glanville: "He's on a special diet, but the other night people 
caught him eating in his car. Eugene loves food. But he also loves money, so I 
expect he'll be losing the weight." 
</P>

Trivia answer: Cal Ripken Jr., Dwight Evans, Tom Brunansky, Fred Lynn and Dale 
Murphy.

DRABEK STOPS MONTREAL AS PITTSBURGH WINS, 6-1 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates have been hovering around last place in the National 
League East all season. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is not Doug Drabek's fault. His record doesn't show it, but the 
27-year-old right-hander is pitching better than he did last season, when he 
finished 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek is 10-9 this season after pitching a six-hitter in the Pirates' 6-1 
victory over the slumping Expos Monday night at Montreal. It was the Expos' 
ninth loss in the last 11 games and dropped them three games behind Chicago in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek, who also drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single, has given up 
three or fewer runs in 21 of the 25 games he has started. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Martinez (12-3), suffering from the flu, lasted five innings and lost 
his second in a row after 11 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm embarrassed to be where we are," Pirate Manager Jim Leyland said. "I don't 
know who will win the East this year, but I'll pick the Expos for their 
pitching. We caught Martinez when he wasn't at his best." 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 7-5, Atlanta 4-2 -- The Cardinals kept their hopes in the East alive 
by sweeping the doubleheader at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Magrane improved his record to 15-7 in the opener, winning for the 10th 
time in his last 11 decisions. Magrane, who gave up six hits and three runs in 
eight innings, also singled in a run in the five-run third inning rally that 
gave him a commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Thompson had three hits and drove in three runs in the opener to hand John 
Smoltz (11-11) his fifth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In the nightcap, the top leading batters in the Cardinal lineup had a big game. 
Vince Coleman and Jose Oquendo each had two singles, a walk, a stolen base and 
scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, losers of four out of five in New York, are 5 1/2 games eout of 
first place. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MORRIS LOOKS GOOD BUT LOSES IN 10 INNINGS, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It has been a tough season for right-hander Jack Morris of the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging more than 17 victories a season for the last decade, Morris has 
suffered both injury and embarrassment this season. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, he has had a serious injury, an elbow problem that put him 
on the disabled list. When he has been healthy, he has often been roughed up by 
opposing hitters. Monday night at Detroit, Morris held the Baltimore Orioles to 
three hits in nine innings. But all it got him was a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th inning Craig Worthington, who was 12 when Morris broke in with the 
Tigers, hit a three-run home run and Morris became a 4-1 loser. Morris, who 
dropped to 2-10, has not had a losing season since he became a regular starter. 
</P>
<P>
"Morris was just outstanding," Manager Frank Robinson of the Orioles said. "He 
took us to school." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson said: "Jack threw the ball awfully well. When 
you lose pitching that well there's nothing you can say." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, twice a 20-game winner, has always given up a lot of home runs. In the 
fourth inning, Stan Jefferson, a .138 hitter, drove a pitch by Morris against 
the facing on the second deck in right for his second home run. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sheets hit a single in the 10th and, with two out, Joe Orsulak drew 
Morris' second walk. Worthington hit one into the second deck in right for his 
12th home run. He has hit four homers in the last 11 games and his 60 runs 
batted in lead all major league rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Since returning from two months on the disabled list, Morris is 0-3 and has 
yielded 17 runs in 40 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' eighth victory in their 10th extra-inning game enabled them to 
remain 2 1/2 games in front in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Boston 2 -- The Blue Jays play better at Fenway Park than they do in 
their own SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
With rookie Mauro Gozzo winning his second consecutive major league start and 
Rance Mulliniks hitting his second home run of the season, the Blue Jays won 
their 13th in a row at Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
Gozzo, who shut out Texas for eight innings in his debut last week, went five 
innings. He gave up seven hits, but only one of the two runs were earned. David 
Wells and Tom Henke held the Red Sox to one hit in the last four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs, coming out of a slump, went three for four nd scored both Boston 
runs. He was three for 20 in the weekend series at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, New York 4 -- If the Yankees fail to win the East, they might look 
back and say this game at Milwaukee is a big reason why. 
</P>
<P>
They went into the bottom of the ninth with bullpen ace Dave Righetti holding a 
two-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
They wound up losing when Gus Polidor, a .194 hitter, drove in the winning run 
with a two-out single. Glenn Braggs opened the ninth with a double and a long 
fly and an infield out brought him home. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti then walked Joey Meyer, and B.J. Surhoff doubled in the tying run. 
After an intentional walk to Mike Felder, Polidor grounded a hit just inside 
the third-base bag. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers remained 2 1/2 games out of first, but the sixth-place Yankees are 
6 1/2 back. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Kansas City 3 -- Dan Pasqua hit a 420-foot home run and Lance 
Johnson later singled home the eventual winning run in the sixth inning at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Pasqua's home run off Luis Aquino (6-7) tied the score, 3-3. A single by Carlos 
Martinez and a bunt set the stage for Johnson to get the decisive hit. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 50th anniversary of the first night game played at Comiskey Park. 
The White Sox also won that one, beating the St. Louis Browns. DAN HAFNER

Cineplex Odeon Corp.: The Toronto-based film distributor reported a 
second-quarter loss of $39 million, contrasted with a profit of $7 million a 
year ago. Revenue totaled $149 million, up 2%. The results were hurt by a 
since-resolved dispute with "a major distributor," a writeoff of $7 million 
after a decision to abandon a U.S. limited partnership deal and $1 million in 
fees associated with the creation of a special directors committee to review 
any proposals to acquire the corporation.

PEOPLE: SCHULER RESIGNS AS ABBOTT PRESIDENT; CLASH REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack W. Schuler has resigned as president of Abbott Laboratories, the nation's 
largest infant formula maker, after apparent personal differences with company 
Chairman Robert A. Schoellhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler, who was named president of the North Chicago-based company in 1987, is 
the third Abbott president in five years to resign after running afoul of 
Schoellhorn. Schoellhorn has assumed Schuler's responsibilities as president. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as a surprise to industry analysts. Schuler is credited 
with the development of Abbott's fast-growing medical diagnostics business. 
Most of Schuler's 16-year tenure at Abbott has been spent in the company's 
diagnostic arm. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a capable, competent gentleman who just didn't get along with the 
chairman," said industry analyst David J. Lothson at Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler's resignation comes as Abbott is facing serious competition in its 
infant formula business, which has accounted for up to 40% of the company's 
operating income. Abbott claims 54% of the nation's infant formula sales and 
the nation's best-selling brand, Similac. 
</P>
<P>
But heavy price competition has taken a toll on profits, say analysts. Also, 
new products introduced by Los Angeles-based Carnation Co. and a joint venture 
by Gerber Products and Bristol-Myers have also intensified competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Their market share has not declined, but profitability has," said industry 
analyst Jerry E. Fuller at Duff &amp; Phelps. JESUS SANCHEZ

<P>
Stocks retreated further in quiet trading Monday from near-record levels 
reached last week, but brokers said the underlying market remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 6.07 points to finish at 2,677.92. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.01 million shares, down from 
197.55 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower behind a weak bond market and on continued profit 
taking after Friday's steep decline. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial index posted its sharpest drop since late 
June after trading above the all-time high of 2,722.42, reached on Aug. 25, 
1987. The market had tested the 1987 peak Thursday, closing at 2,712.63. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices rose late Monday morning but quickly reversed course again and 
seesawed through the remainder of the session. Blue chip stocks rallied early 
in the afternoon, but the broader market failed to keep pace and the rally was 
soon aborted, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The recent action is a timeout to our rally, not a top out," said Alfred E. 
Goldman, vice president of A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "It just 
shows that sellers are not that anxious to sell." 
</P>
<P>
A late selloff in the bond market helped weaken stocks in the final hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said that the market's pause was not surprising after 
recent gains and that the market continued to show an underlying strength. Much 
of the weakness, they said, stemmed from a lack of buying and some computerized 
selling strategies, not from strong individual or institutional selling. 
</P>
<P>
"The market's ability to stabilize after last week shows it has some life to it 
and that upside potential is still viable," said Charles Jensen, chief 
technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 
closed down 7/8 at 38 1/2, General Electric lost 3/4 to 56 5/8, Hewlett-Packard 
fell 2 1/2 to 52 3/4 and Paramount Communications declined 1 3/8 to 59 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
IBM rose 1/2 to 116 1/8, Eastman Kodak advanced 3/8 to 50 3/8 and Procter &amp; 
Gamble gained 2 1/8 to 126 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks closed weaker in Tokyo, but trading was so sluggish because of the 
summer holidays that it was not possible to detect a trend. The key 225-share 
Nikkei index eased 41.34 points to close at 34,671.62. 
</P>
<P>
London stock prices fell sharply in a retreat from their near 30% surge since 
the beginning of the year. The Financial Times 100-share index ended down 28.3 
points, or 1.2%, at 2,325.9. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices plummeted, continuing Friday's selloff amid a growing belief by 
traders that the economy is relatively strong and that the Federal Reserve 
won't lower interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which lost 1 1/4 points on Friday, fell 
another 1-13/32 points, or $14.06, per $1,000 in face amount. 
</P>
<P>
The bond's yield, which moves inversely to price, soared to 8.23% from 8.15% 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said growing pessimism in the bond market is being fueled by more 
evidence of strength in the economy, which many experts had believed was 
tilting toward a recession. 
</P>
<P>
A weakening economy generally stimulates purchase of fixed-income securities 
such as bonds, which are considered a long-term hedge against slow growth and 
high inflation. 
</P>
<P>
A strong economy raises the possibility of higher inflation, which erodes the 
value of bonds. A strong economy also decreases the chance that the Fed will 
take steps to lower interest rates, which also hurts bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody sees any reason to buy anything, and prices continue to erode," said 
Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank PLC in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an ongoing reappraisal about the economy," he said. "A month ago, the 
noise you heard was about a recession. A lot of investors and economists were 
running all over the place seeing who could shout the loudest." 
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics showing strong retail sales figures for July and a 0.1 
percentage point drop in unemployment to an annual rate of 5.2% have reduced 
fears of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the government said business inventories rose 0.4% in June as 
business sales fell 0.3%. Economists said the rising inventories still are not 
unusually large in proportion to sales. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not the type of numbers that beget a recession," said money market 
economist Kevin Flanagan at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9%, up from 8.938% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished higher against major foreign currencies in brisk trading, 
extending last week's strong rally. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery closed at $367.10 an ounce, up $1.90 from Friday. Republic 
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $364.70 an ounce, up 
$1.20. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said demand for the dollar held steady from Friday, when the currency 
jumped to its highest levels since early summer on speculation that U.S. 
interest rates won't decline any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment no one is focusing on lower interest rates," said Robert Ryan, a 
senior trader at Irving Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, the dollar turned mixed Monday, with many traders taking to the 
sidelines before Tuesday's Assumption Day religious holiday, which will close 
many European markets. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 1.83 yen to a closing 141.93 yen. It was quoted at 141.70 yen in London, 
and at 141.925 yen in New York, up from 141.90 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, it cost $1.5840 for a British pound, compared to $1.5850 late 
Friday. One pound fetched $1.5770 in New York, down from $1.5820 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper prices surged on New York's Commodities Exchange in the wake of a 
miners' strike in Peru and expectations that copper will be in short supply in 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
In other markets, grain and soybean prices dropped, energy futures were mostly 
lower, precious metals were up modestly, and meat and pork futures were off. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 2.75 cents to 3 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
August at $1.2035 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The strike in Peru had been planned for several weeks, but it was expected that 
efforts by the government would prevent the walkout. Talks broke down over the 
weekend, resulting in the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
"At least two-thirds if not more of the miners are out," said John Steel, an 
analyst with Refco Co. in New York, adding that the walkout could have an 
adverse effect on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The strike comes as copper production is already suffering due to civilian 
strife in Papua, New Guinea. Also, a strike at Canada's Highland Valley Copper 
Mine in British Columbia continues. 
</P>
<P>
Copper production in Chile could also be disrupted because drought has cut 
power supplies, Steel said. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures closed lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders 
reacted to forecasts of rain in crop-producing areas. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean prices were down sharply, after rising last week on an Agriculture 
Department report projecting lower-than-expected soybean production.

Mary Jane Jacob has resigned as chief curator at the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Art. The museum confirmed rumors of the resignation but offered no 
explanation. A formal announcement will be made later in the week, according to 
MOCA's press office. Jacob joined the museum in 1986 after holding a similar 
post for six years at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. At MOCA, Jacob 
has organized such exhibitions as "A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of 
Representation," a massive show of media-related art that closed Sunday.

FIREWORKS AT BOWL, BUT NONE ON STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Never mind the music -- the fireworks were great. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, was the view of one curmudgeonly critic to whom Gene Evans, a 
pyrotechnics master who designed the final 10 spectacular minutes Saturday at 
the Hollywood Bowl, was the one outstanding artist of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
During his show, many of the colorful explosions were synchronized to the beats 
of the bar in a Sousa march medley by the orchestra. It was compensation enough 
for almost two hours of dreary effusions by the Dukes of Dixieland and the 
Philharmonic conducted by Erich Kunzel -- separately and, alas, together. 
</P>
<P>
If ever two groups belong apart they would be a loose, uninhibited improvising 
Dixieland band and a stiff, orchestrated symphony ensemble dripping with 
strings. At the worst moments, and they were frequent, it was like tuning in 
two radio stations at once. 
</P>
<P>
The present Dukes bear little resemblance to the 1950s band that included the 
Assunto family from Louisiana: Fred, Frank, and their father, Papa Jac, all 
long dead. The name was acquired by a new group. These are trained musicians, 
two with college degrees and one a well known New Orleans jazz historian, but 
with the orchestra running interference (and with Kunzel just standing there 
looking awkward much of the time) it was hard to detect any significant level 
of musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
Only the leader, trombonist Harry Watters, had anything of value to say in his 
solos. The clarinetist Mike Waddell and trumpeter Jim Donovan do not seem to 
have reached maturity; even such trite-and-true material as "The Entertainer" 
and "Clarinet Marmalade" were too much for them to handle. 
</P>
<P>
The works played separately by the orchestra were as forgettable as the Dukes' 
selections were predictable. It would take a genius to make something fresh out 
of a Stephen Foster medley, and genius was not at work here. Only the Henry 
Mancini piece, "Ohio River Boat," provided surcease, with harmony that was 
beyond Foster's wildest dreams. 
</P>
<P>
How, though, to argue with success? This show drew 17,598 on Friday and upped 
the ante to 17,910 Saturday. LEONARD FEATHER

Twentieth Century Fox delayed releasing box-office figures Monday for its 
ballyhooed film "The Abyss." But once the receipts were counted, Fox's big 
entry in the summer sweepstakes -- with an estimated budget of $60 million -- 
grossed only $9.3 million last weekend on 1,300 screens, an average of $6,079 
per screen. The late-summer entry, which opened Wednesday to mixed reviews, was 
not able to supplant Universal's "Parenthood" as box-office champion for its 
second weekend in a row. At $9.7 million, "Parenthood" was down 7% from its 
opening weekend. Freddy Krueger, the horror hero of New Line's "Nightmare on 
Elm Street 5: The Dream Child," finished a close third with $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
* After opening strong in four theaters -- and breaking house attendance 
records in one of them -- Miramax's dark psychological comedy "sex, lies and 
videotape" expanded to 28 screens last weekend. It continued to perform well 
with a weekend take of $602,432, a per-screen average of $21,527.

JIMMY SMITH REVELS IN THE BLUES AT BLUE NOTE GALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Smith saved the best for last at the Mild Seven Lights 50th Anniversary 
Blue Note Celebration, held on a very sunny Sunday at the John Anson Ford 
Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who first recorded his bluesy, at times campy, style for the noted label 
in the early '50s, provided the audience with the kind of straightforward, 
blues-drenched numbers that Blue Note was renowned for. These tunes cooked 
mightily from Bar 1 and the three-quarters-full house responded 
enthusiastically to the organist and his cohorts: guitarist Kenny Burrell, 
saxophonist Junior Cook, bassist Larry Gales and drummer Frank Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The sultry "Mood Indigo" was the set's high point. Here Burrell unleashed his 
pure sound and immaculate execution in soloing with single, repeated notes, 
long, swinging lines and brimming-with-color chordal figures. Cook, wailing 
swaggeringly, and Smith also delivered their share of percolating 
improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson, the scheduled opening act, failed to show (the 
reason given was that he missed his plane) and so his assigned back-up trio -- 
pianist Billy Childs, bassist Tony Dumas and drummer Ralph Penland -- took 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Since the three were once a working unit, their impromptu set had a high degree 
of cohesion as they rendered such tunes as Cedar Walton's "Bolivia" and Monk's 
" 'Round Midnight" with elan. On the latter, Childs, a piano giant in blossom, 
shifted dynamically between sotto-voce chords, tinkling cocktail lines and 
dancing parallel octaves during his solo. As well as the group played, one had 
to wonder what this youthful trio had to do with Blue Note Records. 
</P>
<P>
Further consternation was provided by the touted Blue Note All-Stars, who 
played an unrehearsed set that went from the musical to the mundane. Two 
gleaming unaccompanied numbers by pianist Hank Jones preceded a blues, another 
" 'Round Midnight," a spry bass solo by Reggie Workman on "Yesterdays," and 
"The Song is You." Though drummer Art Taylor crackled throughout and tenorman 
Clifford Jordan played with pizazz, the band, which also included trumpeter 
Dizzy Reece and trombonist Julian Priester, never caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Note Celebration series concludes Sunday with Art Blakey, Horace 
Silver, and a jam session with Freddie Hubbard, Barry Harris, et al. ZAN

CHAMBER MUSIC AT STRAWBERRY CREEK FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETMANSBURGER

<TEXT>
<P>
When is a facade not a false front but the real thing? When it's William 
Walton's "Facade", performed with the professionalism and panache of the 
Strawberry Creek Chamber Players. 
</P>
<P>
Narrator Janet Bookspan, eschewing the traditional monotonal interpretation, 
displayed one unique characterization after another. In so doing, she revealed 
that not all of Dame Edith Sitwell's tongue-twisting poems are the merely 
delightful nonsense they are usually purported to be. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Yehuda Gilad led a crackerjack sextet whose collective versatility in 
both the tongue-in-cheek and occasionally serious styles belied the virtuosity 
of the 1922 score. 
</P>
<P>
One complaint: Nearly every forte (and louder) passage -- numerous in this 
rambunctious work -- found the ensemble nearly burying Bookspan's colorful 
recitation, despite amplification. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the best had been saved for last, as the first half consisted 
mainly of second-rate Mozart. The Quintet in G minor, K. 516, had a little of 
everything at times: Wayward intonation, thin tone and miscalculated balances. 
</P>
<P>
Only the adagio movement emerged with the cohesiveness and transparency 
Mozart's music demands. Perhaps a last-minute program change and replacement of 
an indisposed first violinist were principal culprits. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with a seductive reading of Nielsen's "Serenata in Vano." 
Led by clarinetist Mitchell Lurie's dulcet tones, the uniquely scored work's 
bucolic nuances were faithfully re-created. GREG HETMANSBURGER

Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak of Poland, stalled in his efforts to put together a 
government, called Monday on President Wojciech Jaruzelski to appoint the head 
of the small United Peasants' Party in his place. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak appeared to stop short of submitting a formal resignation. He blamed 
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa for complicating and prolonging his effort to 
form a Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said last week that his free trade union movement was ready to form a 
coalition with the Communist-allied groups -- the United Peasants and 
Democratic parties -- and said Solidarity would vote against any government 
Kiszczak submitted to Parliament for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response to the Kiszczak announcement from Solidarity. 
Its senior leaders have declared that they would be willing to lead the 
government but not enter into any "grand coalition" of the sort proposed by the 
government. Kiszczak and Jaruzelski have offered repeatedly to organize such a 
coalition, which would include members of all the parties represented in 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's parliamentary leader, Bronislaw Geremek, declined to comment on 
Kiszczak's announcement. Walesa could not be reached immediately, but Henryk 
Wujec, a Solidarity member of Parliament, dismissed as "idiotic" the suggestion 
that Roman Malinowski, head of the United Peasants' Party, be asked to form a 
government. He said Walesa would not support such a move. 
</P>
<P>
"Malinowski has no chance to make it," Wujec said. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa spent most of Monday in Warsaw, where he expected to meet with 
representatives of the Peasants and Democratic parties on his proposal to form 
a coalition based on less than 40% of the seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviets Criticize Walesa 
</P>
<P>
A factor of mounting concern in the drawn-out drama over the Polish leadership 
is the attitude of the Soviet Union, which finally broke its silence on the 
issue. On Monday, Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party daily, accused Walesa of 
damaging efforts to ease the political tension in Poland. It charged that his 
actions could lead to a "prolonged governmental crisis in Poland." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, according to the Polish news agency, the Soviet ambassador in Warsaw 
met with Kiszczak and leaders of the Peasants and Democratic parties. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak, who was elected Aug. 2, said Monday that he would present his 
recommendation to Jaruzelski "so that he considers the new situation and draws 
from it the proper conclusions." As president, Jaruzelski chooses the premier, 
who must then be approved by Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"A situation has emerged," Kiszczak said, "in which I see a chance for Roman 
Malinowski to form a new government in which there would be representatives of 
all forces in the Parliament. At the same time, it would point to a clear sign 
of the priority treatment given to agriculture and the food economy in Poland's 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Malinowski, a 54-year-old economist, has led the Peasants party since 1981. 
Last year he was the Speaker of Parliament. In the political jockeying over the 
formation of a new government after elections in June, Malinowski has been 
reluctant to endorse efforts by his party's floor leader, Aleksander 
Bentkowski, to bolt the Communist coalition and form a new alliance with 
Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
Bentkowski said Monday night that he was not sure Malinowski would accept the 
post if it were offered, since Solidarity has made it clear that it wants to 
lead any such coalition, not merely join it. 
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Kiszczak in this way is presenting his resignation," Bentkowski said. "In 
an elegant manner, he is making the president realize that somebody else has to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bentkowski said his candidate for premier would be Walesa. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 
a Solidarity member of the Senate, said Sunday that Walesa was considering 
accepting the role of premier in a Solidarity-led government. 
</P>
<P>
The role of the two Communist coalition partners has taken on prime importance 
here since the June elections, which guaranteed the Communists 37% of the seats 
in Parliament. The Peasants party, with 76 votes, and the Democrats, with 28, 
control the balance of power between Solidarity and the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, at Bentkowski's urging, the Peasants threatened to vote against 
Kiszczak's nomination for premier, causing his election to be delayed by a day 
until the Communist leadership flexed its muscle and forced the rebellious 
party back on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
At that stage, it appeared that Kiszczak would be able to proceed with the 
formation of a government to deal with snowballing economic problems. The most 
pressing of these problems are consumer shortages, rising prices and renewed 
worker demands for higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there has been public cynicism over what many Poles regard as 
a mere reshuffling of familiar faces at the top of the government, with 
Jaruzelski taking on his new role as president, Kiszczak moving from the 
Interior Ministry to the premiership and the outgoing premier, Mieczyslaw F. 
Rakowski, taking over as Communist Party leader. 
</P>
<P>
After its sweeping success in the June elections, the Solidarity leadership 
rejected Jaruzelski's proposals to join the Communists in a grand coalition. 
Its most influential leaders, reflecting the moderate core of Solidarity, went 
a step further and acknowledged that the union movement was not yet experienced 
enough to run a government -- even in the unlikely event that it would be given 
the opportunity to do so. 
</P>
<P>
However, the apparent inability of the Communist leadership to organize a 
government -- and to manage its own coalition -- has led some moderates to 
suggest that Solidarity, despite its inexperience, could hardly do worse than 
the Communists, whose authority and effectiveness appear to be declining daily.

GLOBAL WARMING EFFECT; 
</P>
<P>
RISING SEA SEEPING INTO COAST PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It still seems more science fiction than fact -- the prediction that global 
warming will cause ocean levels to rise and inundate coastal areas around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
And even though it may be more than a decade before the theory can be proven, a 
small but growing band of planners, politicians and environmentalists isn't 
willing to wait. Already, they are preparing for the flood. 
</P>
<P>
Against the din of skeptical developers and engineers, these regulators have 
already begun to incorporate sea-level rise into coastal planning in Maine, 
Massachusetts, Maryland, Florida, North and South Carolina, Louisiana, Oregon, 
Washington and other states -- but nowhere more than in California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bay at City's Door 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Marker, mayor of Corte Madera, runs a city already fighting back the 
waters of San Francisco Bay. To her, the threat is real and, on the time scale 
of public works, imminent. "Our projections indicate that we have to do 
something within 10 years," Marker says. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Signal Landmark, a large Southern California landholder, is including 
ocean rise in plans for its 1,600-acre Bolsa Chica project, a marshland 
restoration and housing development that could cost as much as $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like looking at the earthquake potential of an area," Carl Neuhausen, the 
company's vice president for planning, says. 
</P>
<P>
Even unconvinced developers such as Donald P. Warren, president of Redwood 
Shores Inc., which owns 3,000 acres on the shores of San Francisco Bay, take 
planners' concern about sea-level rise seriously. Warren has already pondered a 
round number for the higher dikes his development might eventually need: about 
$3 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Greenhouse' Side Effect 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic, if gradual, rising of sea level could be one of the most calamitous 
effects of the predicted warming of Earth from heat trapped by greenhouse gases 
in the atmosphere. These gases, released since the first industrial smokestacks 
pushed skyward, include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and 
chlorofluorocarbons. Their effect in the upper atmosphere has been compared to 
closed windows in a car left out in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Like any other material, oceans expand; water rises as it is warmed. Estimates 
deemed plausible by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency range from 2 to 7 
feet of rise around U.S. shores by the year 2100, just from this great 
swelling. In a worst-case scenario, one or more major sheets of polar ice could 
melt rapidly and cause seas to rise higher still. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal management decisions -- from the building plot of a bungalow to 
nationwide strategies for wetlands preservation -- are now based on time spans 
ranging from 30 to 100 years. Yet planners worry that rapid ocean rise is not 
yet being anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive, long-range planning now, planners say, would involve relatively 
minor inconvenience and would be well worth the effort, compared to the costly, 
destructive, ad-hoc defenses likely to be thrown up if the big waves arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the White House Council on Environmental Quality agreed, warning that 
government may have to adjust for global warming "even before all the 
uncertainties are known." 
</P>
<P>
Still, serious planning for global warming can seem like so much hot air to 
many understandably dubious politicians, developers and civil engineers, who 
are being told again -- as in the on-again, off-again energy crisis -- that 
disaster is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
When a staffer recently presented a draft report on sea-level rise to the 
California Coastal Commission, he described a future in which dikes might be 
thrown up at Malibu and the sand could disappear from Will Rogers State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Realtor's Nightmare 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to have to tell some guy who wants to build a house in Malibu . . . 
that we think the ocean's going to come in your front window," protested 
Commissioner Steve MacElvaine of Morro Bay, who called for a more careful 
review of the scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough resources for work we need to do today," complained 
Dorill Wright of Ventura County, "let alone to deal with something being 
studied by others that could happen 100 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, many scientists believe that higher sea levels could be here a 
lot sooner than that. They say that the first flooding of Corte Madera and 
other low-lying developments in California could come within the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as 
two University of Toronto scientists, independently announced that the world's 
oceans have been warming and rising twice as fast as previously observed -- a 
confirmation of the greenhouse theory, though still not proof of it. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating matters, no one knows how high the waters might go. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Haltiner, a San Francisco coastal engineer advising Corte Madera, said 
of the bales of technical reports on global warming being released worldwide: 
"You see numbers all over the place. They seem to be revising them all the time 
-- but they seem to be revising them upward." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics say it is too soon to base policy on shifting predictions, but many in 
the public-regulations game around the country sense a need for urgency. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we make (construction) permit decisions, it's a 40- to 50-year 
decision at least," said state Coastal Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld of 
Malibu. "To not be concerned about things that are 40, 50 years in the future 
is very shortsighted." 
</P>
<P>
Few areas have yet looked to that future as soberly as communities in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orange County Rule 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since 1985, Orange County has required developers to assume in their 
engineering plans that the level of the Pacific is rising. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, which 
oversees development within 100 feet of the bay, began in March to require that 
plans for structures from pier restaurants to waterfront condos allow for 
rising water. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laguna Beach now allows seawalls only as a last resort against erosion. A 
recent study raised concern that future barriers, including those that might be 
thrown up to protect hotels and homes from a rising sea, could also destroy 
beaches. Seawalls have lately been found to encourage the movement of sand in 
front of them and, by protecting cliffs from erosion, to discourage formation 
of new sand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Corte Madera has factored sea-level rise into its $8-million plan for dike 
renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foster City, much of which lies below the water level of adjacent San 
Francisco Bay, may also have to raise its levees. If it does, the city plans to 
add enough height for the next 100 years of projected sea level rise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sometime next year, the California Coastal Commission is expected to 
reconsider a sea-rise policy, Peter Douglas, the executive director, said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The district engineer of the Marin County Flood Control and Water 
Conservation District said that his office is drafting new codes to raise by 
two feet the minimum floor level of shoreline buildings above the water, in 
direct reaction to the possibility of sea-level rise. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how much any of this eventually will cost. Even on a nationwide 
scale, financial projections are scarce. Yet a rising sea could be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a modest three-foot rise, EPA cost estimates run as high as $111 
billion over the next century for efforts to save only the densely developed 
areas of the American shoreline, or about a sixth of the area that would be 
flooded. 
</P>
<P>
Such an enormous effort would still abandon thousands of private homes on 
shores outside those areas. Environmentalists aren't likely to accept another 
cost of this strategy, either. Because of the way shorelines work, the dikes 
and levees needed for such an all-out battle to hold back the sea could destroy 
as much as 70% of America's coastal wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
How likely is an ocean rise? 
</P>
<P>
The sea has been lifting, in fact, in a grand, natural cycle since the last ice 
age peaked, about 15,000 years ago. Yet this should bother only the most 
long-range worrier. In the past 100 years the oceans have risen a mere 4 to 6 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns most scientists is the prediction that global warming, which most 
now believe is real, could greatly accelerate this rate. In that case, the sea 
will expand and rise, overflowing coastlines around the world and drowning 
low-lying areas such as the Marshall Islands (including Bikini and Eniwetok 
atolls, the former atom-bomb test sites) in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Californians at first would likely experience infrequent but massive storm 
surges, when the effects of sea-level rise, an El Nino condition and a winter 
storm converged. Eventually, in most scientists' scenarios, they could see a 
doubling or tripling of the size of San Francisco Bay, bulldozed rock seawalls 
along the Southern California beaches, a landward migration of development and 
a northward migration of people from Mexico and Central America -- people the 
United Nations already has dubbed "ecological refugees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Billion Homeless 
</P>
<P>
Recently, in fact, the United Nations warned that over the next 60 years, 
rising oceans could flood the settlements of 1 billion people. The study, by 
the U.N. Environment Program, advised nations to begin now to curtail coastal 
development, and to be ready to assist the owners of existing shore-based 
businesses and homes as their lands must be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
As EPA Administrator William K. Reilly announced unhappily on a recent trip to 
Los Angeles: "The world, I am afraid, is not yet ready for this." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it could be, with a little planning, said James G. Titus, the EPA's project 
manager for sea-level rise. Anyone researching the subject sooner or later 
hears of Titus, who is both respected for his science and known variously as 
Mr. Sea-Level Rise, the Guru of Sea-Level Rise or simply as a true believer. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics on global warming commonly blame the true-believer scientists and 
environmentalists for stirring up debate -- and worse, more government 
regulation -- over a mere theory. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't plan now," Titus said, "people will develop the coast on the 
assumption that they can stay there forever. Then, as sea level rises, and you 
either evacuate or defend the coast, people will instinctively erect bulkheads 
and levees to protect their investment." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many developers and engineers currently dismiss any sea-level concern 
by saying they will build protective seawalls if and when they have to. 
</P>
<P>
Titus and other scientists say that over time, most of these defenses will have 
to be abandoned, yet by then the seawalls will have thwarted the ability of 
wetlands and beaches to adapt slowly and move inland. So there would be not 
only a lot of unhappy developers and homeowners, but a lot of lost beaches and 
wetlands, too. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists and environmentalists want planned abandonment of shore 
developments as the ocean rises, and they think this hot-potato policy decision 
should be considered soon. 
</P>
<P>
Titus believes the first step is to put people on notice that sea-level rise 
could happen. Formal wording could be included in property deeds, for example, 
spelling out that a house would likely have to be moved or abandoned in 30 or 
50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when the time comes, instead of the panic of imminent catastrophe, 
"People will go relatively quietly," Titus predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Planning would also ensure fairness to developers, he continues, with more 
optimism than most. Without uniform rules, it doesn't pay a builder to make 
costly plan adjustments just to assure that a house won't be threatened by 
rising water before the owner pays off the mortgage -- especially since 
practically no buyers yet even ask about sea-level rise. 
</P>
<P>
"Government planning," Titus said, "would eliminate the competitive 
disadvantage of being far-sighted." 
</P>
<P>
The real issue, Titus believes, is not whether the sea level will rise, but 
planning for the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're building a hazardous waste site, or a septic tank, under the beach, 
something that could become a real nuisance," Titus said, using an extreme 
example, "maybe even a 1% chance of a rise in sea level would motivate you to 
change the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the skeptics remain unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
To developers such as Lewis (Tig) Tarlton of San Francisco, ocean rise is just 
more gloom-and-doom from environmental Cassandras, the "sky-is-falling, 
sea-is-rising group." 
</P>
<P>
"Chicken Little, and the world is falling down," rails Charles R. Roberts about 
planners' fears. Roberts is chief engineer for the Port of Oakland, having 
spent 39 years in the field. "And I haven't seen the sea level rise in that 
half century . . . . It's a trend to talk about sea level." 
</P>
<P>
In Malibu, Robert Rubenstein of Malibu Realty said: "No one really seems to 
care" about such disasters in Malibu. "When the floods hit, they just build 
again. My clients, they get another deal for a (motion) picture, they come back 
and buy another house."

HAMMER WINS BUSH PARDON IN VOTING LAW CASE 
</P>

<P>
President Bush pardoned Los Angeles industrialist Dr. Armand Hammer on Monday, 
ending a decade-long quest by the 91-year-old founder of Occidental Petroleum 
Corp., who had pleaded guilty to making illegal contributions to President 
Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials, who normally do not release the names of people granted 
pardons, confirmed that Hammer was one of 10 pardoned by Bush on Monday after 
Hammer announced the decision in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply appreciate President Bush's action in clearing my name," Hammer said 
in a prepared statement. "Having spent my lifetime fighting injustice, this 
vindication reinforces my abiding faith in the American system of justice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Quest 
</P>
<P>
Hammer had been seeking a pardon almost since the moment he pleaded guilty -- a 
second time -- in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Associates have said that he and attorneys who represented him were deeply 
disappointed last year when then-President Ronald Reagan failed to include 
Hammer in a final round of pardons issued shortly before he left office. At the 
time, Reagan pardoned New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whose legal 
troubles, like Hammer's, resulted from contributions made to Nixon's reelection 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer pleaded guilty twice to three misdemeanor charges involving $54,000 in 
illegal contributions to Nixon's 1972 reelection. The first time was in 
October, 1975, when Hammer pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington to the 
charges, which had been filed by the Watergate special prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
But only days after entering the plea, Hammer sent a letter to his probation 
officer blaming the crimes on Occidental executive Timothy Babcock, a former 
governor of Montana. Prosecutors initially had learned of Hammer's involvement 
in the illegal payments from Babcock, who had pleaded guilty to a related 
charge in 1974 and received a four-month jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing of Hammer's letter, U.S. District Judge Walter B. Jones voided 
Hammer's guilty plea and ordered him to stand trial. The case was subsequently 
moved to federal court in Los Angeles after doctors for Hammer told the judge 
that a heart ailment had made the industrialist too frail to travel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left Hospital 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1976, under threat of a felony indictment, Hammer left a Los Angeles 
hospital and appeared before U.S. District Judge Lawrence T. Lydick. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting upright in a wheelchair during a 20-minute court hearing, Hammer 
admitted in a soft but firm voice that he had concealed illegal campaign 
contributions to Nixon. He said he was "pleading guilty because I am guilty and 
not to avoid a trial." 
</P>
<P>
At his sentencing later, the millionaire oilman told Lydick: "This was the 
first time I have been charged with a criminal offense and I greatly regret my 
actions." He was fined $3,000 and placed on one year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
As he later wrote in an autobiography, Hammer almost immediately "set out to 
clear my name." He contended that an investigation he had started had turned up 
"exonerating evidence," which became part of his plea for a pardon. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was unavailable to comment Monday on what that evidence might be. 
</P>
<P>
In his long and colorful career, the Bronx-born Hammer, who was educated as a 
medical doctor, has been an enormously successful industrialist, who developed 
a remarkable relationship with the Soviet Union. He has met every Soviet leader 
since Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
With his wealth, Hammer has collected fine art, endowed museums and contributed 
to cancer research with tens of millions of dollars in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986, Hammer 
financed trips by American physicians to treat radiation victims. 
</P>

BUSH SIGNS $897-MILLION FARM AID BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush signed legislation that will speed $897 million in assistance to 
farmers whose crops he said had been battered this year by "the forces of 
nature." The bulk of the aid -- $400 million -- will go to wheat farmers whose 
winter harvest in Kansas and other states was devastated by drought. At the 
other extreme, the Disaster Assistance Act will compensate farmers in the South 
and elsewhere whose rice, soybean, cotton and other crops were wiped out by 
rain, wind and floods. Bush, saying "money's tight," noted that the package 
will "provide relief only to those farmers hardest hit by adverse weather. And 
it wisely rewards those who took the prudent step of purchasing crop 
insurance." The House had passed a $1.4-billion drought relief bill in June, 
but, under pressure from the White House and the Senate, it acceded to the 
version signed by Bush.

Prosecutors said they have obtained a subpoena to question South Korean 
opposition leader Kim Dae Jung in connection with charges that two members of 
his party spied for North Korea. Kim angrily denied any wrongdoing and said he 
would comply with the subpoena to prove his innocence. Kim, leader of the Party 
for Peace and Democracy, accused President Roh Tae Woo's government of trying 
to destroy the opposition. Prosecutors said Kim would be asked questions about 
a secret three-day visit to Communist North Korea by party lawmaker Suh Kyung

The bodies of two Southern California men have been recovered from the wreckage 
of a private plane that crashed Aug. 6 south of Mammoth Lakes. Fresno County 
sheriff's deputies were notified by two hikers over the weekend that they had 
found the wreckage of the single-engine Piper Cherokee in the Pioneer Basin 
area north of Edison Lake. The bodies of the pilot, Redwan Abouhamed, 29, of 
Hawthorne, and a passenger, John Lazar, 29, of Inglewood, were found in the 
burned wreckage. Authorities said it appeared that Abouhamed took the wrong 
corridor through the mountains and was attempting an emergency landing when the 
plane clipped a boulder, crashed and burst into flames.

Hong Kong rejected U.N. criticism that it has mistreated some of the 50,000 
Vietnamese "boat people" who have flocked to the British colony. A team from 
the Geneva headquarters of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had warned 
that serious overcrowding would lead to fresh outbreaks of violence among 
frustrated inmates of refugee camps. "The space is less than the space given to 
people in prison here. It is even less than what is supposed to be given here 
for a dog," Omar Bakhet, head of the agency's technical support unit, said on 
local radio. However, Hong Kong's refugee coordinator, Mike Hanson, called the 
criticism "entirely unreasonable" and noted that "we can't build new 
accommodations overnight."

Honduras' armed forces cordoned off the frontier zone along the Nicaraguan 
border where about 10,000 U.S.-backed Contras are based to keep them from 
moving deeper inside Honduras, a military spokesman announced. And Honduran 
President Jose Azcona Hoyo said that if the Contras turned their guns toward 
Honduras instead of accepting a call from Central American presidents to 
disband, they would be dealt with severely. "The Contras have to understand 
that (their) military option is practically canceled," he said.

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said he fears Americans 
are growing hardened to the AIDS epidemic and warned that more must be done to 
alleviate the crisis. In a speech in Washington to a national conference on 
AIDS in racial and ethnic groups, Sullivan said: "Our first order of business 
must be to make each and every American take notice of this problem. Denial is 
an avenue to the spread of the disease." He noted that AIDS has been diagnosed 
in more than 100,000 people since the disease was first reported in 1981 -- and 
that number is expected to more than triple during the next three years.

ON CALIFORNIA: STILL WATERS ON BATTLEFIELDS RUN DEEP

In California, water wars tend to have the lives of vampires. They refuse to 
die, feeding off the bitterness, outlasting whole generations of bureaucrats 
and lawyers. That's why the recent news from Owens Valley and Mono Lake seems 
so remarkable. The oldest and meanest vampire of them all suddenly looks creaky 
in the knees. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is Los Angeles' war. It's the war that got Los Angeles enough 
water to grow into the dominant urban beast of the West Coast. And it's the war 
that gave the city its reputation as a bloodless opportunist, a colonizer of 
communities weaker than itself. 
</P>
<P>
Out here in the Owens Valley, no one has put up historical markers at any of 
the battlefields. They should. There are places like the Alabama Gates, the 
concrete sluiceway where hundreds of farmers threatened to shut down the 
aqueduct. There's the site of the old Watterson bank, whose owners resisted Los 
Angeles' takeover until the city instigated a timely audit of their books. The 
Wattersons were hauled off to San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the aqueduct itself. Gleaming steel, it runs like a huge straw 
through the valley. The markers might show the spots where the aqueduct was 
dynamited half a dozen times in the '20s and then once again in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
With that history, anyone suggesting the end of this struggle is running a 
serious risk of looking the fool. So let me quickly submit my evidence: 
</P>
<P>
Early this month the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power agreed to a plan 
that would make the extraction of water from Owens Valley a joint venture with 
valley residents. Inyo County, which has long led the fight against the city, 
would have an equal voice in determining whether the water exports are 
threatening vegetation or wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
At Mono Lake, the city pledged last week to support legislation aimed at 
preserving the lake. As city officials know, the only way to accomplish that 
goal is to reduce the city's diversions of streams that feed the lake with 
fresh water. It will mean somewhat less water flowing to the city, more water 
to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, these proposals must travel a great distance before they become 
reality. But clearly also, the city has accepted the necessity of absorbing 
some losses in its water supply -- maybe 10%, maybe less -- to do the right 
thing in the eastern Sierra. Los Angeles is suing for peace. 
</P>
<P>
And just why is interesting. It would be nice to think that these events 
represent a greening of the DWP, or at least a recognition by its leadership 
that the old days of the water barons are gone forever. But that hardly seems 
to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Los Angeles came to its position of sweet reason because it has 
little choice. Over the last decade the courts have pounded the city in case 
after case involving its Owens-Mono behavior, and they are threatening to pound 
some more. The city discovered compromise only when its legal powers in the 
eastern Sierra proved to be much less than it had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not flail at the DWP here. This is supposed to be a good news column. 
No matter what pushed the DWP into the spirit of accommodation, it got there. 
</P>
<P>
And there could be better news yet. It's possible that this half-century of 
struggle -- if it's resolved -- might leave the eastern Sierra with the best of 
all worlds. After all, the city's monolithic presence in Owens Valley kept it 
as free of commercial development as any national park. Even today you can ride 
up U.S. 395 and see nothing but the great wall of the Sierra on the west and 
the open chaparral of the Valley on the right. It is a dazzling scene. 
</P>
<P>
On the 300,000 acres of city lands there are no billboards, no Denny's. You can 
hunt and fish those lands or just drive down a quiet road and sit. The city 
will not send out goons to throw you off. 
</P>
<P>
That part has always been there, of course. The flip side, the intolerable 
part, was the powerlessness imposed on the valley people from without. I 
remember driving up 395 a decade ago and seeing clumps of dead and dying trees 
dotting the valley. The locals all believed that the trees were dying of 
thirst, that the city's water extraction was killing the valley. So they had 
tied big red ribbons on the branches of the dead trees. It was a sign of 
mourning, and it was all they could do. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in 1989, maybe that's changing. It will take a while before we know. As 
someone else said in different circumstances, this is not the end, nor is it 
the beginning of the end. But it just may be the end of the beginning.

BID TO LIMIT RISES IN CAR POLICY COSTS IS PROMISED

Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie opened five days of hearings on 
Proposition 103-mandated changes in auto insurance pricing methods here Monday 
with a pledge to "channel" the law to avoid large rate increases for millions 
of policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's pledge may be good news for policyholders in San Diego, the San 
Joaquin Valley, rural Northern California and the Inland Empire who, under the 
new law, might have found themselves subsidizing lower prices in Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. But for policyholders in the largest urban centers, it means 
there is likely to be little price relief. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with deciding what to do about the present system of basing prices 
largely on where a policyholder lives, Gillespie indicated that she may direct 
that the residency factor be applied only on a regional or countywide basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I will try to channel the law to make sure it does more good than harm," the 
commissioner said. 
</P>
<P>
As an illustration, Gillespie said that if there is a flat regional rate 
applied in San Diego and the Inland Empire, the average auto insurance rate 
would rise by 3% in Imperial County and 2% in San Diego County, but decline by 
1% in San Bernardino County and 4% in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
If, by contrast, countywide rates were applied, she said the average rate in 
San Diego County would rise by 14% in La Mesa and 8% in Vista, but decline by 
2% in San Diego and 5% in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing to be held in Los Angeles today, Gillespie may reveal estimates 
for what the possible alternative systems would do in Los Angeles, Orange and 
Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's estimates are based on averages, and there could be greater 
fluctuations in individual rates if either of the new systems were used to 
replace the present sharp neighborhood-by-neighborhood variations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Factors 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 says that a driver's safety record, miles driven and years of 
driving experience should be used, in that order, as the most important 
criteria for setting rates. But it allows Gillespie to employ other factors as 
well -- such as place of residence, marital status, sex and age, as long as 
they are shown to have an influence on claims costs. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie declared Monday that to apply this literally and impose a flat rate 
statewide, rate increases in some areas of up to 60% could result. In only 
three of the state's 58 counties -- Los Angeles, Orange and San Francisco -- 
would rates go down. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as the hearings opened, positions of the various parties had not 
changed since June, when earlier hearings were held. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry representatives warned that doing away with or subverting 
neighborhood-based pricing would result in enormous price increases for most 
Californians, and save money only for those who reside in the highly populated 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield charged that 
Gillespie is engaged in "fraud" and "propaganda" in warning that implementing 
Proposition 103 could mean large increases for many. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield charged that the insurance industry is withholding from Gillespie 
data about what would happen if the new law's rating criteria were used, and 
said she should not make up her mind what to do until the companies provide the 
data. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie had a mild response, remarking that she wished Rosenfield would work 
with her rather than against her. But she did say that she would like more 
pricing data from the companies.

TOWN'S VITAL THREAD FROM 'EL NORTE' IS SEVERED BY FATAL SHOTS ON FREEWAY

EL JUAMUCHIL, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friends and relatives had been coming by the tiny house for days, trudging up 
the rutted dirt roads, waiting for the coffin to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Women in their best black dresses and lacy mantillas and men with their hats in 
their hands sat in chairs rimming the edge of a room where one candle burned in 
front of a picture of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
It was the house that Juan Pedro Trujillo was building. The floor was dirt, 
weeds were growing in one of the rooms that still had no roof, and the red 
brick, crudely held together by cement, was exposed on many of the walls. The 
only sign of Trujillo was in a back room, where he kept three "boom boxes" and 
suitcases full of California clothes he had purchased in "El Norte," the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Saturday, a full week after Trujillo was gunned down at the wheel 
of his pickup truck as he was driving down the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange, his 
body was delivered to his family in this impoverished village in central 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
And for one final night, Trujillo rested in his family's home, among the 
candles and the flowers and the sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting of the 22-year-old Mexican man has baffled police in Southern 
California, not only because it seemed unprovoked and random, but also because 
there have been so few incidents like it since a spate of highway violence two 
summers ago drew national attention to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But in this village with no telephones, the incident broke a delicate thread of 
economic support that had tied Trujillo's life in California to his family in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we have comes from the sweat of Juan Pedro," said his father, Pedro 
Trujillo. "You can ask anyone around here -- before he left to go work in El 
Norte, we had nothing." 
</P>
<P>
It is the refrain of El Juamuchil. Mothers fret about sons who leave at a 
tender age to seek work in the United States, but point proudly at the homes 
they have built with the money they send back. Girlfriends talk wistfully of 
young men from their town who write love letters from places like Anaheim, San 
Mateo and Chino, asking for their hands, promising to take them away from this 
small town. And fathers who, although they also may have spent some of their 
youth up north, feel slightly ashamed that the land their fathers left them is 
no longer enough to support a family. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in Mexico we lack so much that one waits for what they send us," said 
Juan Pedro's aunt Ramona Toribio Barajas, whose four sons are in California. 
"This is why so many from the town go to El Norte." 
</P>
<P>
El Juamuchil, in the state of Jalisco about 50 miles southeast of Guadalajara, 
is an ejido, a piece of land that was divided up after the Mexican revolution 
among the peasants who had worked it for large landowners. But with each 
generation, the parcels grow ever smaller as the land passes from fathers to 
several sons. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Pedro's father grows sorghum or corn on the plot his father left him. 
Every year, the yield diminishes as the soil is depleted. Pedro Trujillo was 
overjoyed when Juan Pedro was born after he and his wife, Carmen, had had three 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"Juan Pedro would help me from the time he was very little," his father said. 
</P>
<P>
One day, a friend told Pedro Trujillo that he was going to the United States to 
work. So he told Juan Pedro, who was then 18, that it was time for him to go, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Juan Pedro went to Oregon to pick strawberries. After a few months, 
he went to stay with his sister Carmen, who was then living in Santa Ana with 
her husband and children. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, they moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Anaheim -- Carmen and 
her husband and their six children, as well as Juan Pedro, his younger brother 
Guillermo, a cousin and another friend. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Juan Pedro applied for amnesty and began work at a tire store in 
Santa Ana. He regularly sent money home to his parents, even though he earned 
only about $250 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, he went back to Mexico to help his father build the new house 
that they had started the year before. It was meant to replace the little shack 
where the family had grown up. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Orange County in April when they ran out of construction money. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen and Guillermo say Juan Pedro was a family-oriented man, who did not go 
out often without the rest of his family in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday night, Aug. 5, after a small party in a neighbor's apartment, 
Juan Pedro, Guillermo and their cousin Rene Trujillo drove in Juan Pedro's 
beat-up pickup truck to Taqueria Guadalajara on 1st Street in northern Santa 
Ana to eat. 
</P>
<P>
As they drove home on Interstate 5, a route they knew well by now, they laughed 
and joked, Guillermo said. Suddenly, they heard a crack. Juan Pedro thought it 
might be a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
"When he turned to look, that's when they hit him," said Guillermo. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Pedro's head fell on his brother's shoulder. His blood would be smeared 
all over Guillermo's clothes by the time he and his cousin grabbed the wheel 
and drove in a panic to their Anaheim home. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Pedro died at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange. Police believe the car 
from which the shot was fired was an older, dark-colored Oldsmobile Cutlass, 
but they have no other clues. 
</P>
<P>
His brother is inconsolable. He has recounted the story many times since 
returning to El Juamuchil, but still he trembles when he talks. 
</P>
<P>
"In the blink of an eye, everything is finished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because one man wants to take another man's life, why does this have to 
happen?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was more than a brother to me. He was like a second father, but much more 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, in the hottest part of the day, four men hoisted Juan Pedro's 
coffin onto their shoulders and carried it down the dirt road, past a small 
herd of dairy cows. 
</P>
<P>
The townspeople and others from miles away trailed behind, and then crowded 
into El Juamuchil's tiny church, a tall building made of the same red brick. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is subject to uncertainties," said the priest. "Life is subject to 
limitations." 
</P>
<P>
After the Mass, 24 pickup trucks and other cars crammed with mourners made 
their way to a cemetery in La Barca, three miles away, and there they stood as 
Juan Pedro's body was lowered into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Missing from Sunday's crowd was a 16-year-old girl who had been at the house 
the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Her name was Josefina, and Juan Pedro had told his family he would marry her in 
December when he returned again from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Josefina had sneaked out of her parents' house and made the 
three-hour trip from her town by bus and dirt road, bearing red and white 
carnations, because she had been told that Juan Pedro's coffin would be there 
by then. But when she learned that his body had not yet arrived, she collapsed 
and Juan Pedro's sister took her into his room. When she regained her 
composure, she quickly left the Trujillo home, not talking to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after Juan Pedro died, letters for him had arrived in Anaheim. The 
unopened letters were placed in his coffin and buried with him, Josefina's 
return address visible on the envelopes.

MILITARY, POLITICAL STUDY ORDERED FOR BEIJING STUDENTS

All of next term's new students at Beijing University, a hotbed of recent 
unrest, will be sent to army academies for a year of military and political 
training, a university official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Huang Weicheng, head of the president's office, said October's intake of 
first-year students will also be cut to 800 from the more than 2,000 originally 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
"The students will go through military and political training. They -- men and 
women -- will learn basic culture and military affairs," he said. The state 
education commission, not the university, made the decision, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The expensive move means that undergraduates will need five instead of four 
years to complete their studies. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Beijing University, China's most prestigious, was being singled 
out after playing a leading role in months of pro-democracy protests that swept 
the country until the army crushed the movement with heavy loss of life in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most-Wanted List 
</P>
<P>
Wang Dan, a 24-year-old history student at the university, tops the police list 
of 21 most-wanted student leaders. He is believed to have been captured last 
month, but the authorities have not released any information about his fate. 
</P>
<P>
"The academies will be able to supervise and watch the students closely," a 
diplomat commented. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities have sometimes in the past sent students to military 
academies but usually for short periods. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, officials said this year's graduates will have to work for one to 
two years before they can begin postgraduate studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to guide students so that they become close to the workers and 
peasants," Deputy Education Minister He Dongchang was quoted as saying in the 
party's People's Daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"During the unrest and counterrevolutionary turmoil, we painfully saw how 
students had gone farther and farther along the road of bourgeois liberalism," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the families of the U.S. Embassy staff in Beijing returned to 
China. About 260 dependents were evacuated in June after shots were fired by 
Chinese troops into the U.S. diplomatic compound. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 40 dependents arrived on a flight from the United States via Tokyo. 
They were greeted by Ambassador James R. Lilley.

WEATHER HAMPERS SEARCH AT LELAND CRASH SITE

<P>
The first sign of the place where Rep. Mickey Leland's last humanitarian 
journey ended is the appearance of American helicopters hovering like 
dragonflies over the rocky mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the crash site itself comes into view: a nearly vertical green cliff, a 
clearing smudged with black, dotted with shards of metal and the red flags that 
U.S. search teams placed there Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Leland, a Texas Democrat, and 15 traveling companions were killed, apparently 
instantly, when their plane struck the cliff Aug. 7. They had headed out from 
the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in heavy weather, to a camp of Sudanese 
refugees at Fugnido, about 58 miles west of this tiny settlement near the site 
of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. service personnel who found the wreckage Sunday have discovered that the 
rigors of their six-day search may be surpassed by the rigors of the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"The most difficult problem is the site itself," said Air Force Maj. Gen. James 
F. Record, commander of the operation. "The footing out there is treacherous 
because it is slate and gravel, with heavy undergrowth and high grass. The 
slope is 60 to 80 degrees over the entire site." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the terrain, the wreckage cannot be reached except by means of a 
line suspended from a helicopter. Four U.S. Air Force Blackhawk helicopters 
with 250-foot-long lines will be used to put people on the site and to retrieve 
everything from it. 
</P>
<P>
The closest landing place for helicopters appears to be half a mile away -- a 
three-hour overland trip. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Record said recovery and identification of the bodies could take much of 
the rest of the week. In perfect weather, he said, the operation could be 
completed today, but in the usual wind, fog and rain, it could take at least 
another two days. 
</P>
<P>
Because the condition of the bodies is not yet known, officials are not sure 
how much time will be needed to identify them, or even if this can be 
accomplished in Ethiopia. It may be necessary, they said, to wait until they 
can be taken to a U.S. base in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, a 40-member American medical team is standing by in Addis Ababa, 
prepared to begin the identification process. 
</P>
<P>
Also unclear is the extent to which an examination of the wreckage, to be 
undertaken by an Ethiopian team with American assistance, will disclose what 
caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
One mystery is why the plane's emergency transmitter, a device designed to 
begin operating automatically upon the impact of a crash, failed to transmit. 
Record, an experienced search-and-rescue coordinator, said such transmitters 
work for 72 hours after a crash "in 85% of the cases." 
</P>
<P>
Some details may never be known, including the weather in the area at the time 
of the crash. The chief meteorological officer at Addis Ababa airport said 
Monday that he had advised the plane's pilot on the day of the crash to cancel 
his flight because visibility along the flight path was so poor. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the pilot spotted a cloud clearing from a weather radar photo 
and tried to make for it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopters Forced Back 
</P>
<P>
The kind of rough weather that had plagued the search delayed the recovery 
operation for several hours Monday. Military spokesmen said the MH-60 Blackhawk 
helicopters that are indispensable to the mission had flown only 50 miles west 
of Addis Ababa toward the crash site 210 miles away before they ran into heavy 
fog and low clouds that forced them to return. 
</P>
<P>
Although operations were to have begun at 5 a.m., the helicopters did not leave 
the capital until 11:15 a.m. They finally reached the site about 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four helicopters did not make it to the crash site at all Monday. 
They were forced to spend Sunday night and Monday morning at a remote village 
about 60 miles southwest of Addis Ababa when darkness and fog prevented their 
return to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you we had a lot of apprehension about setting down there," said 
Lt. Col. John Taylor, commander of one of the helicopters. "We were armed men, 
the town wasn't expecting us, we were in a strange country and we didn't know 
if the natives were friendly." 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, the crew members were greeted by several hundred friendly 
villagers who built them a fire, offered them food and engaged them in a 
nightlong discussion on U.S.-Ethiopian relations. The 12 crew members returned 
to Addis Ababa on Monday afternoon, glowing with cross-cultural camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't relish the landing beforehand, but it turned out to be a significant 
experience in my life," Taylor said. "I'll never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strained Relations 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the cooperation 
between the United States and Ethiopia in the search for Leland may ultimately 
lead to an improvement in relations between the two nations, which have been 
strained in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
A senior official said later that the search was "an example that there can be 
good will . . . between us. It is a step forward." But he added quickly, "It 
doesn't negate the issues between us." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher also said Ethiopia has accepted the offer of help from the U.S. 
National Transportation Safety Board in investigating the crash. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Walter Bollinger, the top administrator for the Agency for 
International Development's Africa program, said Leland's long experience in 
the area had enabled the agency, a branch of the State Department, to build 
better relations with Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
AID's mission in Ethiopia, which had shrunk to just one U.S. citizen two years 
ago, had been increased to five people, three of whom were aboard the Leland 
plane along with an Ethiopian AID employee. 
</P>
<P>
At the crash site Monday, crews spent the day stringing lines and nets around 
the wreckage to provide workers with secure footing. Six men were left at the 
scene overnight to provide security. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Record said there was no effort Monday to identify the victims at the 
site. Accordingly, official Pentagon figures still put the number of confirmed 
dead at 12, out of a total of 16 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
But Record reiterated what has been the conclusion of all those who have viewed 
the crash site: "In my professional judgment, looking at the site and the 
impact angle, there were no survivors."

WALLENBERG'S KIN INVITED TO MEETING IN MOSCOW

The Soviet Union has invited relatives of the disappeared Swedish diplomat 
Raoul Wallenberg to Moscow amid signs it may at last be prepared to clear up 
the fate of the man credited with saving tens of thousands of Jews during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
The invitation was handed to the Raoul Wallenberg Assn. in Stockholm last week 
by Soviet Ambassador Boris Pankin, association chairman Per Anger said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Anger, who was serving with Wallenberg in the Swedish Embassy in Budapest when 
he disappeared in 1945, said he would travel to Moscow in October together with 
Wallenberg's half-sister, Nina Lagergren, and half-brother, Guy von Dardel, and 
association secretary Sonja Sonnenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
Sonnenfeld said it is the first time anybody connected with Wallenberg had been 
invited to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a breakthrough. It's clear they want to talk with us, and we were told 
the meetings would be at a high level," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallenberg was last seen in public on Jan. 17, 1945, being driven to see the 
commander of the Soviet troops occupying Budapest after the Nazi retreat. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, then-Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko said in a 
diplomatic note to Sweden that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack in a 
Moscow prison 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But frequent accounts by former inmates of the Soviet Union's vast prison and 
labor camp system suggested that he was alive well into the 1970s. He would be 
76 if he were still alive today. 
</P>
<P>
Wallenberg has been hailed as one of the great heroes of the struggle to save 
Jews from Nazi extermination. 
</P>
<P>
Using his Swedish diplomatic status to move around, he took at least 20,000 
Hungarian Jews under his personal protection, commandeering abandoned buildings 
and handing out special Swedish passports ensuring immunity from Nazi 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1957 note, which has served as the basis for all further Soviet 
statements on the subject, Gromyko regretted Wallenberg's arrest and 
imprisonment and blamed Stalin era officials who were later executed. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden did not accept the Soviet explanation and has kept an open file on 
Wallenberg ever since.

6 FROM E. GERMAN OPERA TROUPE IN BRITAIN DEFECT TO W. GERMANY

<P>
Six members of a leading East German opera company have defected to West 
Germany after a two-week tour in London, the West German embassy said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
An embassy spokeswoman said five singers and technicians left the Komische Oper 
company and flew to West Germany late last week. A sixth visited the mission 
Monday before leaving Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the six were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The East German Embassy in London refused to comment on the defection. A 
spokesman for the Komische Oper in East Berlin said, "I can't confirm or deny 
this." 
</P>
<P>
But the Daily Express newspaper quoted lighting engineer Fred Spodzieja, 41, as 
saying he had planned his flight to the West for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Communist East Germany, which keeps a tight rein on the cultural activities of 
performers, has lost many talented artists during Western tours. Others have 
been expelled to West Germany for opposing the official party line. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, hundreds of East Germans have sought an exit to the West by 
taking refuge in the West German Embassy in Hungary and Bonn's mission in East 
Berlin. The flood of people became so great that both buildings have been 
closed while Bonn negotiates with Communist authorities.

AMERICANS WANT TOUGHER DRUG LAWS, POLL FINDS

<P>
The American public favors tougher anti-drug laws and periodic drug testing for 
people from all walks of life, according to a Gallup Poll released Monday at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
People are so disturbed that three-fourths of all teen-agers and nearly half of 
adults are ready to volunteer to help in drug prevention programs, education 
and treatment, said George H. Gallup, co-chairman of the Gallup Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"A record number of Americans cite the drug crisis as the nation's top problem, 
replacing the 'guns and butter' issues of international tensions and economic 
worries," he said at a news conference also attended by William J. Bennett, the 
national drug policy director. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 50 years that the U.S. public has been asked to name the most important 
problem facing the nation, it is virtually unprecedented for any social issue 
to appear at the top of the list," Gallup said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who will in a few weeks release the Administration's strategy to 
combat the drug crisis, said the poll shows that "the American people have 
given a very clear sense of direction to us." 
</P>
<P>
In the poll, taken in June and July, 27% of the adults questioned selected 
drugs and drug abuse as the most important problem facing the country. Eight 
percent put poverty, homelessness and hunger at the top; 7%, the economy in 
general, and 6% each for the federal budget deficit and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear of War," the category listed the most worrisome by 27% of adults in 1985 
and 23% in 1987, was listed first by only 4% in the new survey. 
</P>
<P>
Next came crime, inflation, other economic problems and a decline in morals, 
each with 3%, then abortion, unemployment, the trade deficit and 
dissatisfaction with government, at 2% and quality of education, 1%. Other 
problems were listed by 12% of the adults, and the rest said they had no 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teen-Age Concern 
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse was listed by 32% of teen-agers as the most important problem facing 
the country, ahead of fear of war, 14%; economic issues, 13%; environment and 
pollution, 7%; political issues 6%; AIDS, 5%; crime, 3%; abortion, 2%, and 
alcohol abuse 1%. Nine percent of the teen-agers listed other concerns and the 
rest said they didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
For the poll, Gallup did telephone interviews with 1,005 adults and 500 
teen-agers. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage 
points for the adults and six percentage points for the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"The 54 years of scientific polling have shown in times of crisis such as war, 
the public is willing to make great sacrifices to the public good," said 
Gallup. "In key ways today, the American people are in a wartime mode and sense 
a national emergency in the drug crisis."

MISSISSIPPI REP. SMITH DIES IN AIR CRASH

Freshman congressman Larkin Smith (R-Miss.) died in a light plane crash in 
Mississippi, authorities said Monday, making him the second member of the House 
killed in an aviation accident in a week. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine Cessna 177 crashed Sunday night in thick woods near the tiny 
community of Janice. Smith and the pilot, Charles Vierling, who also was 
killed, were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, according to federal and 
local officials. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers combed the heavily wooded DeSoto National Forest through the night 
but were unable to find the wreckage until Monday morning, when they spotted it 
from the air. "There was a 300-foot-long path cut by the plane," Harrison 
County Sheriff's Department Capt. Rick Gaston said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 45, died the same day the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. Mickey 
Leland (D-Tex.) and 15 others was found on an Ethiopian mountainside. Leland's 
plane had been missing almost a week after he took off on a fact-finding 
mission to combat hunger. 
</P>
<P>
News of Smith's death was followed by an outpouring of sympathy from 
Mississippi to Washington, even as Smith's colleagues were still mourning 
Leland's death. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President and Mrs. Bush 
"deeply regret" Smith's death, adding that Smith, who was elected to a seat 
vacated by Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), "was just beginning a promising career in 
the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a former sheriff and police chief, was already developing a reputation 
on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We (the congressional delegation) had come to depend on him in the fight 
against drugs," said Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) "This is a 
tremendous loss to his family, his state, and the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Smith had thrown out the first ball at the Dixie Youth World Series baseball 
tournament Sunday and was heading home to Gulfport, taking off at about 9:10 
p.m. for the 35-minute flight. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman here, said the plane 
"lost radar contact" at 9:25. He said area residents "heard the airplane crash" 
and notified officials. Barker said visibility was 4 to 6 miles, and "rain was 
reported, but not heavy." 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Breland told the Associated Press that "my wife was preparing to go to 
bed, and we heard a plane coming over. I thought at the time it was unusual for 
a plane to be in the area at night." He said he heard a "revving sound and then 
a crash." 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Jorge Prellezo, regional director of the National Transportation 
Safety Board, said a team of investigators had been dispatched to the scene. 
Investigators generally take months to establish a probable cause of such 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The plane belonged to the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies Inc. in Gulfport. 
The institute immediately issued a statement saying that Smith had requested 
use of the plane "to accommodate his busy schedule." Jody Canady, a 
spokeswoman, said Smith was to reimburse the institute. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the plane, manufactured in 1973, and purchased by the 
institute last year, had a "current inspection." The pilot received his license 
in 1964 and had a physical examination on June 28, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was elected last November to represent Mississippi's 5th congressional 
district. He was Harrison County Sheriff from 1984 to 1989, and was Gulfport 
police chief from 1977 to 1983. As sheriff, Smith coordinated anti-drug efforts 
of federal, local and state agencies across five states. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, survived by a wife and one child, was lauded by Mississippi Gov. Ray 
Mabus, who called his death "a tragic loss" for the state and ordered flags on 
state property flown at half staff. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and former associates in Gulfport were stunned and saddened. Gaston, 
who worked for Smith nine years both in the sheriff's department and earlier 
when Smith was Gulfport police chief, called Smith "a pillar of strength. He 
was progressive, and above all, honest. You just never thought something like 
this would happen."

Telephone company workers in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin 
joined the ranks of striking "Baby Bell" employees on both coasts as a walkout 
against three companies entered its second week Monday. 
</P>
<P>
No talks were scheduled between Ameritech and representatives for 35,000 
unionized workers in the Midwest, who declared a strike early Sunday, said a 
spokeswoman for Illinois Bell. 
</P>
<P>
About 13,000 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers settled last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
One company, Bell Atlantic, offered the Communications Workers of America a 
revised offer regarding medical benefits at a bargaining session in Washington, 
company spokesman Larry Plumb said, but he did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bickers, a spokesman for the CWA, said the union's 41,000 members remained 
pessimistic. "We're at about the same place we were when we went on strike" 
eight days ago, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As the strike continued from coast to coast, incidents of vandalism were 
reported at several local telephone company sites. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, a vehicle struck and injured a picket outside a New York Telephone 
Co. facility in Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
At another New York phone company site in Elmont, police investigated a bomb 
threat and a fire that officials said was deliberately set to a company car. 
</P>
<P>
The CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers unions struck 
Aug. 6 against Pacific Telesis telephone companies in California and Nevada, 
Bell Atlantic, and NYNEX in the Northeast and New England, idling more than 
150,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
No new talks were scheduled with union representatives and Pacific Telesis, 
NYNEX and at Michigan Bell, officials said.

<P>
One of them, built in 1967, houses as many as 160 patients with spinal cord 
injuries. Here, resting in drab wards of seven beds each, men and women in 
wheelchairs struggle toward health in quarters that are noisy and crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 130 feet away at the end of a corridor, meanwhile, is the sleek new 
140,000-square-foot Ernest Bors Spinal Cord Injury Center, which is twice the 
size of the older ward. 
</P>
<P>
There, the long shining halls are graced with large color photographs of 
sailboats, seascapes and hot-air balloons. Electric doors swing open at the 
touch of a button, while soft interior lights illuminate the decor. Spacious 
day rooms filled with new furniture still covered in plastic complement large 
four-bed patient suites, landscaped patios and a dining room with tables that 
drop electronically from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the security guards who patrol it and the gardeners who mow the 
lawn, however, the place is as deserted as a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
It's been that way since last October when the $18-million two-story Bors 
Center was dedicated with great hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
Then the money ran out. After discovering a major deficit in their annual 
health care budget, administrators at the Department of Veterans Affairs in 
Washington decided to use the money that was earmarked to finish the Long Beach 
building and others elsewhere to maintain basic medical services instead of 
completing new building projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patients Next Year 
</P>
<P>
And although Congress recently approved emergency legislation to restore the 
money, medical center officials say, the Ernest Bors building -- the largest 
spinal cord injury center for veterans on the West Coast -- is likely to remain 
vacant at least until early 1990 when hospital officials hope to move in the 
first patients from the cramped ward next door. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sitting over here with a horrendous white elephant on its back," said 
Joe Fox, vice president of the 1,500-member California Paralyzed Veterans 
Assn., which represents the state's estimated 9,000 veterans with spinal cord 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those veterans are wheelchair-bound or bedridden and require special 
ramps and modern medical equipment that the new building will provide. While 
some of that equipment is available in the older facility, access to 
state-of-the-art care in the Ernest Bors facility will make their difficult, 
painful existences easier, veterans say. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is complaining," said Ed Santillanes, the association's president. 
"The only thing that's being used is the dining room for meetings and parties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful building, but it's just a showpiece. It's been a constant 
(source of frustration)." 
</P>
<P>
The 120-bed Ernest Bors Center -- named after a pioneer specialist who was once 
the hospital's chief of spinal cord injury service -- features modern built-in 
oxygen suction systems for those with respiratory difficulties, easily 
accessible bathrooms with lights that go on automatically when someone enters 
and special trapeze devices on each bed to enhance patient movement and 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the center is equipped with an extensive system of ramps for 
wheelchair access, private and semiprivate areas for recreation and relaxation 
and a one-bedroom apartment to help prepare paralyzed veterans and their 
spouses for independent living. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of things have changed in the last 20 years in how you treat spinal 
injury patients," said Dean R. Stordahl, director of the medical center, 
located on Long Beach's east side near the Orange County line. "Their life 
expectancy has increased and we are more conscious of privacy now. There is 
heightened awareness in society that these are not people to be pitied and 
treated as patients, but as viable individuals." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center was chosen as the site for the 
Ernest Bors center because its spinal cord injury program is the largest on the 
West Coast and one of the best known in the country, Stordahl said. 
Construction started in 1986 and, for two years, went as planned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Year's Predictions 
</P>
<P>
At last year's dedication ceremony, attended by various dignitaries including 
Thomas K. Turnage, head of the Veterans Administration in the Reagan 
Administration, hospital officials confidently predicted that the newly 
completed building would be in use by early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But they needed about $2.4 million more to finish the job. And about the same 
time that veterans officials in Long Beach were proudly conducting grand tours 
of the massive new building, officials in Washington were discovering an 
unexpected $635-million deficit in their national health care budget. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, said Donna St. John, a spokeswoman for the Veterans Administration, 
congressional appropriations had not kept pace with rising costs, gradually 
creating an unforeseen deficit. As a result, St. John said, 96 building 
projects nationwide were put on hold. Besides the Ernest Bors Center, projects 
delayed in California included a smaller spinal cord injury unit in San Diego 
and a planned hospital dormitory in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Steps Delayed 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, Stordahl said, the withholding of funds meant the delay of 
several steps necessary to the center's completion. Among them were the 
installation of the telephone system, nurse-call devices, patient monitoring 
equipment and television sets, as well as the purchase of linens and supplies, 
specialty beds and rehabilitation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Incensed by the delay, the national Paralyzed Veterans Assn. and other groups 
launched an ambitious lobbying effort aimed at persuading Congress to enact an 
emergency supplemental funding bill to save the stalled projects. Their efforts 
were aided by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), among others, who as chairman of 
the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, spearheaded a drive to see the bill 
through. 
</P>
<P>
On June 23, Congress approved $345 million in emergency supplemental funding 
for Veterans Administration projects. According to a Cranston aide, the $2.4 
million expected in Long Beach should arrive this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Snags Seen 
</P>
<P>
But even when the money comes, Stordahl said, it will take at least 120 days to 
purchase and install the new equipment under rules that call for competitive 
bidding. At best, he said, half the patients will be moved to the center early 
next year and the second half two months later. About 40 spinal injury beds, he 
said, will remain in the present ward, with the rest of the older building 
planned for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans charge that the delay constitutes a hardship for spinal injury 
patients, especially those in need of the special respiratory and monitoring 
equipment. Stordahl maintains that patient care has not been impaired. And the 
cost of maintaining the empty building, he says, is minimal.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 200 RALLY AGAINST JAIL EXPANSION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 demonstrators from four communities near downtown Los Angeles 
converged on the Men's Central Jail on Monday evening to protest a proposed 
expansion at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The county hasn't taken an objective look at the appropriateness of expansion 
at this location, because it was assumed there would be little opposition from 
the surrounding immigrant communities," City Councilman Michael Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and merchants from Chinatown, Olvera Street, Lincoln Heights, and 
Little Tokyo displayed signs and shouted slogans as they marched from their 
neighborhoods to the jail on Bauchet Street, where the county has proposed 
adding 2,408 beds, bringing the capacity to 9,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, fellow Councilman Richard Alatorre and state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles) joined the protesters during the march and at a rally in the jail's 
parking lot, where they demanded that county supervisors scrap the preliminary 
environmental impact on the expansion and schedule new public hearings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WARRANTS ISSUED FOR CRA COMMISSIONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Community Redevelopment Agency commissioners who failed to appear at a 
trial of a man they charged with disrupting a May commission meeting were 
issued bench warrants Monday, but agency officials said it was all a mistake 
stemming from an attorney's illness. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Robert Sandoval issued "body 
attachment" orders for agency Commissioners James Wood, Frank Kuwahara, Dollie 
Chapman, Daniel Horwitz and the Rev. Thomas Kilgore, who were subpoenaed to 
testify at the trial of a man who allegedly heckled the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Alaniz, director of public affairs for the redevelopment agency, said 
the city attorney representing the CRA had planned to ask Monday for a 
continuance, but was stricken with an illness and was not represented by 
another city attorney, so the trial proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
"The CRA attorney will be there the first thing in the morning to straighten it 
out," Alaniz said. 
</P>
<P>
The trial stems from a May 17 meeting when Wood, the commission's chairman, 
made a citizen's arrest of William Hayes and Howard Watts for allegedly 
disrupting a public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts of the meeting show that Watts openly challenged Wood on a number 
of disputed points concerning the CRA's controversial plans to build a massive 
Los Angeles County complex on 1st Street. However, the charges against Watts 
were dropped, and the CRA pursued Hayes, even though transcripts show Hayes sat 
quietly through the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
According to the transcript, the only time Hayes spoke was when Wood directed 
another speaker to use a microphone. "There's one on the table," Hayes is 
quoted as saying.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTI-ABORTIONISTS' PLANS RECOUNTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks before anti-abortion militants blockaded a women's clinic, 
representatives of the group informed the Los Angeles police that they intended 
to stage the demonstration in violation of a court order and get arrested, a 
police commander testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The group also asked that if its members were arrested that they be released 
without charges, said John White, operations commander for the LAPD's West 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
White was the first prosecution witness to testify in the opening day of a 
trespass and conspiracy trial for five leaders of Operation Rescue. The charges 
stem from a March 25 sit-in staged by the anti-abortion group at a clinic on 
Westmoreland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
White, describing a meeting with three Operation Rescue representatives on 
March 3, quoted national spokesman Joseph Foreman as saying that the group's 
goal was to "save children's lives" but that it also planned to resist arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Lara Bloomquist said White's testimony was designed to show 
the defendants, though not present at the March 3 meeting, conspired to break 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening statement, the prosecutor said defendant Randall Terry, 30, 
founder of Operation Rescue, urged his followers to illegally close the clinic 
and block women from entering it because "God's law is more important than 
man's law." 
</P>
<P>
Only one defense attorney made an opening statement. Douglas E. McCann focused 
on what he described as excessive force used by police. 
</P>
<P>
On trial with Terry before Municipal Judge Richard A. Paez are Jeff White, 31, 
of Santa Cruz; Andrew Eppink, 41, of Palmdale; Donald Bennette, 36, of Mission 
Viejo, and Michael McMonagle, 36, of Philadelphia.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED WITH THREAT TO TV'S LANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 57-year-old unemployed Los Angeles laborer, who for five years purportedly 
sent letters and gifts to television anchor Kelly Lange, was charged Monday 
with making a terrorist threat against the KNBC-TV newswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested Warren Sevey Hudson, 57, on Friday at the Linda 
Motel on West Washington Boulevard. Investigators said they found a .38-caliber 
Colt revolver and ammunition in his room. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC notified the Los Angeles Police Department last week that someone had been 
telephoning Lange and sending her gifts -- which were returned -- although she 
had never seen the man or spoken to him. 
</P>
<P>
While investigating the threat, police said they found an employee at a 
downtown gold and silver exchange -- where Hudson formerly worked -- who quoted 
Hudson as saying Aug. 9 that he was "bored with life and that he was going to 
Burbank to shoot Kelly Lange." 
</P>
<P>
Lange and the station refused to comment Monday on Hudson's arrest, according 
to station spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto.

FALLING ANGELS GET FLATTENED BY TWINS, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Post-Oakland depression hit the Angels hard Monday night. The high from 
Sunday's exhilarating victory over the Athletics dissipated quickly, bottoming 
out all over the field during a 6-3 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, two ninth-inning strikeouts of Jose Canseco and Dave Henderson can 
carry a team only so far. 
</P>
<P>
You want offense? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had 10 hits in 7 2/3 innings against Minnesota starter Allan 
Anderson but could turn only two of them into runs. 
</P>
<P>
You want pitching? 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Kirk McCaskill gave up hits to the first batters he faced, both 
Twins eventually scoring. By the sixth inning, he had given up nine hits and 
five runs, and by the seventh inning, he was finished. 
</P>
<P>
You want defense? 
</P>
<P>
Angel left fielder Chili Davis was at it again, committing one error that led 
directly to one Minnesota run and reacting creatively to a couple of other 
balls hit in his direction. 
</P>
<P>
The loss left the Angels 2-5 since this home stand began, dropping them 1 1/2 
games behind first-place Oakland in the American League West. The Athletics 
were idle Monday, but, at least in spirit, they didn't appear to be the only 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an Angel letdown was addressed in Manager Doug Rader's 
postgame interview session, but Rader did his best to deny it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we kept the weekend in perspective and there wasn't a letdown," Rader 
claimed. "We were not flat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on defense a lot early and didn't get our offense going early. We 
didn't have a lot of activity on the bases and that might indicate a letdown, 
but there wasn't one." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence, however, would suggest otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill (12-7) was in trouble from the outset, giving up a leadoff single to 
Al Newman, who advanced to third on Dan Gladden's double. 
</P>
<P>
Just the way you like to face Kirby Puckett for the first time of the night: 
With no outs and two runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett drove in one run by grounding out to second base. Clean-up hitter Randy 
Bush drove in the other with a single to left field, giving the Twins a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, the Angel defense began to break down around McCaskill. 
Bush opened the inning with a flare to left field, which should have dropped 
for a single but wound up skipping under Davis' glove for an error, allowing 
Bush to take second. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, Brian Harper singled home Bush and Minnesota led, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill worked a scoreless inning in the fifth, only to work his way into 
difficulty in the sixth. With one out, Gary Gaetti singled and Jim Dwyer 
walked, with Harper's sharp grounder to third base moving both runners into 
scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
And score they did, with John Moses blooping a hit down the left-field line and 
into Davis territory again. Davis took awhile to collect the baseball and when 
he did, he made amends, of sort -- throwing to second baseman Johnny Ray, who 
slapped a tag on Moses to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
But by then it was a 5-1 game, and McCaskill was looking at an early departure. 
He pitched to one more batter, Wally Backman, who opened the seventh inning 
with a double into the left-field corner. On came Angel relief pitcher Greg 
Minton, who yielded hits to the first two Twins he faced, with the first, a 
single by Newman, scoring Backman with Minnesota's sixth run. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill was charged with six runs (five earned) on 10 hits in six-plus 
innings, his earned-run average rising from 2.81 to 3.00. 
</P>
<P>
"He had good stuff, but couldn't locate it well," Rader said. "Sometimes he 
gets preoccupied with location. 
</P>
<P>
"But that isn't a big indictment, because a couple of the hits he gave up were 
so-so. But a hit is a hit. It was not a fortunate night for Kirk." 
</P>
<P>
Nor for Minton, whose August struggles continue. In his previous six outings, 
Minton had surrendered 10 earned runs and 12 hits in five innings -- including 
three home runs in his last two innings. And Monday, Minton gave up five hits 
in 2 2/3 innings, leaving in the ninth with two outs and two runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
Rader blamed the reliever's tailspin on too much reliance on his specialty 
pitch, the sinking fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"Minton still needs to start throwing some other pitches," Rader said. "He 
needs to start throwing a breaking ball -- and he will." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson (14-9) failed to complete the eighth inning when he began to complain 
of a twinge in his upper back. With two outs in the eighth, Minnesota Manager 
Tom Kelly brought on reliever Juan Berenguer, who yielded the Angels' final 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Berenguer walked the first man he faced, Tony Armas, and gave up a single to 
the next, Lance Parrish. Pinch-hitter Jack Howell followed with a bloop double 
down the left-field line that scored Armas and might have scored Parrish had a 
fan not reached over the field-box railing and touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Fan interference was called, holding Parrish at third. Parrish was stranded 
when Kent Anderson grounded to first for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon retired the Angels in order in the ninth, earning his 22nd save. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing glaringly wrong tonight," Rader kept insisting. "We just 
gave up a few hits and got beat. No need to dissect any further." 
</P>
<P>
For the Angels, there's only a need for new inspiration before 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starting on the left side of the Angel infield Monday night were Kent Anderson 
at shortstop and Bobby Rose at third base. Manager Doug Rader gave Rose, 23, 
his first major league start, teaming him with rookie Anderson, the 
injury-replacement for Dick Schofield. Why? Because Rader wanted to give his 
regular third baseman, Jack Howell, a night away from the pennant race. Howell 
is mired in a three-for-34 slump and was coming off a particularly rough 
series, both in the field and at the plate, against Oakland. "I just wanted to 
get Jackie away from it, like I've done with others from time to time," Rader 
said. "He can get away to work with Deron (Johnson, Angel hitting coach) with 
the batting cage without the pressure of playing today." Rose was recalled from 
double-A Midland last week to fill the roster vacancy created when Schofield 
was placed on the 21-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitters Brian Downing and Claudell Washington traded places Monday, 
with Downing returning to the lineup in time to replace Washington, who was 
sidelined after receiving a cortisone injection in his left shoulder Sunday. 
Downing hadn't played since Aug. 4 because of a flare-up of his chronic 
rib-cage condition. Washington was available only for pinch-run duty and 
figures to be a few days away from returning to the Angel outfield. . . . 
Reserve catcher Bill Schroeder was also relegated to the bench after receiving 
a cortisone shot in his right elbow Sunday. Schroeder underwent elbow surgery 
when he played for Milwaukee in 1986 and, according to Angel trainer Rick 
Smith, has had periodic problems with inflammation in the elbow ever since. 
With starter Lance Parrish playing with a tightly wrapped sore rib cage, rookie 
John Orton, 23, was the only able-bodied catcher on the Angel roster. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven, the 38-year-old who might never grow up, still gets a kick out 
of watching things blow up. For Monday's prank, Blyleven strolled quietly past 
a huddle of sportswriters in the Angel clubhouse and nonchalantly dropped a 
firecracker on the floor. Off it went within feet of the writers, rattling a 
few eardrums and causing Rader to open the door of his office and peer out at 
the smoke. "Schoey, stop fooling around," he yelled at Schofield, the 
mild-mannered shortstop who usually makes about as much noise as a rosin bag. 
Blyleven and Rader both grinned knowingly and then went off to resume their 
daily rounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ricky Berry, first-round draft choice of the Sacramento Kings in 1988, 
apparently committed suicide Monday at his suburban Sacramento home after 
arguing with his wife Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
A Sacramento County Sheriff's spokesman said Berry's wife, Valerie, who had 
spent the night away from the couple's newly purchased home, found the 
24-year-old player on the floor of the family room with a gunshot wound to his 
head when she returned Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
A suicide note was found at the scene, but the sheriff's department did not 
reveal what was written. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokesman said an autopsy is being done, but that a single 
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head was the apparent cause of death. Time 
of death has not been established. 
</P>
<P>
Kings' officials held a brief news conference Monday afternoon at Arco Arena, 
outside which a hand-lettered cardboard sign read, "Due to a death in Kings 
family all offices are closed for the day." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Reynolds quietly began a statement, "My prayers . . ., " blinking 
back tears, but was unable to continue and left the podium. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from managing general partner Gregg Lukenbill was read by another 
Kings' official. 
</P>
<P>
"We are profoundly shocked and saddened at the tragic ending of the life of 
Ricky Berry," said the statement, which was read by Greg Van Dusen, the 
executive vice president of the Arco sports complex. "Ricky was a kind, 
thoughtful, sensitive, caring and soft-spoken young man who was spirited and 
talented as an athlete. Our thoughts and prayers are both with Ricky and with 
his family in this time of grief." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Russell, the Kings' executive vice president of basketball operations, was 
consoling the Berry family and did not attend the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's father, Bill, had been in the Kings' Sacramento office when the team 
was notified of the death. The elder Berry, fired as San Jose State coach after 
last season, had arranged to do some college scouting for the Kings, and was in 
Sacramento discussing details, according to Julie Fie, the team's publicist. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Berry lost his San Jose State job after a season in which the core of the 
team quit in protest of his coaching. He had been unsuccessfully seeking a job 
as a college assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
Russell and Bill Berry went to the young couple's home in a suburban Sacramento 
County area known as Carmichael in the afternoon but declined to speak with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Those consoling the family would open the door only to sheriff's deputies and 
family friends, among them Sacramento native Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here extending out our services, mine and my family's," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Ricky Berry and his wife moved into the home about two weeks 
ago. On the lawn, a wooden sign marked "Sold" still stood. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents were aware that a National Basketball Assn. player had moved 
into the upscale neighborhood and had seen Berry do much of the moving work 
himself, but few had met the young couple. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in my head to go over this morning and knock on the door, introduce 
myself and welcome them to the neighborhood," said Bill Dana, 59, who was 
working in his yard when emergency and law enforcement officials began arriving 
shortly after 9:30 a.m. Dana said he had been home the night before but had not 
heard any signs of argument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragedy, that's for sure," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, a 6-foot-8 guard-forward, averaged 11 points a game in his rookie season 
with the Kings, scoring a career-high 34 points in a game in February. At San 
Jose State, he became the leading scorer with 1,767 points despite playing only 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Berry began his college career at Oregon State in 1983-84, but transferred 
after one year to play for his father at San Jose State, where he averaged 24 
points a game in his senior season. He was a member of the U.S. team that won 
the silver medal at the Pan American Games in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Kings chose him with the 18th pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates and associates were bewildered by Berry's death. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Saulny, former San Jose State assistant who coached Berry in his senior 
season, said he saw Ricky at the last San Jose State home game of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe it," Saulny said. "He was the kind of guy who didn't say 
a whole lot. Maybe there was something inside of him that nobody knew. 
Obviously there was. . . . Ricky was a poker-faced player. Ricky was a 
poker-faced person. No one really knew what was inside." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the news conference said there were no signs that Berry had 
troubles with his wife, and said his relations with coaches, team members and 
management were excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Vinny Del Negro, also a rookie last season, said by telephone from 
North Carolina that Berry had seemed happy during the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Ricky was a very competitive player with a bright future," Del Negro said. "He 
always enjoyed himself. He enjoyed cars. He seemed to enjoy life a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the couple had been having problems, Del Negro said, "not that I know 
of. Not that I ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird . . . Obviously a lot of people don't understand (what has 
happened.) . . . Something had to be affecting him. Who is to say? We don't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope his family can find some peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
Berry was one of only a few Kings' players who were spending the summer in 
Sacramento. He had spent some of his time working as a volunteer, Fie said, 
helping with a basketball camp at Cal State Sacramento last week and working in 
a similar clinic in Stockton last month. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave a lot back to the people," Fie said. "He still had all that spirit of 
a young player and loved being out among the people." 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been married since May, 1988, and had no children. Berry was 
born in Lansing, Mich., where his father was a Michigan State basketball 
player. Berry is survived by his wife, father, his mother Clarice and a younger 
sister Pam.

JIM MURRAY: VACATIONS DO HAVE THEIR TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every vacation you go on, you hope for three things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To take 10 strokes off your handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To get a tan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To get a rest. 
</P>
<P>
Well, one out of three ain't bad. The tan, I got. 
</P>
<P>
My golf game which you have to know, if it were human, belongs in an iron lung, 
I gave no break at all to. I went to Jack Nicklaus and told him I opted to play 
his new course on the island of Kauai, the Kiele on Kalapaki Beach at the 
Westin Kauai. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll add 10 strokes to your handicap," frowned Jack. "It's for guys who can 
play a little." 
</P>
<P>
"Ten shots in my handicap is like a pitcher of water in the ocean," I told him. 
"Where's the first tee?" 
</P>
<P>
Now, I don't know what Kiele stands for in English but, by the fourth hole, the 
best guess in the foursome was that it was Hawaiian for gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii is a funny place. They put umbrellas in the drinks and orchids in the 
eggs. They take the prettiest island landscape in all the world -- and make a 
leper colony out of it. Now, the last thing a poor leper needs is a view. Or a 
drink with an umbrella in it. But Hawaii's a place where they take some of the 
most breathtaking scenery in all the world -- and put a hotel on it. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere is there a more diabolical use of real estate than to take the 
Pacific Ocean and make a par-5 out of it with no place to lay up. It is widely 
reported that only five people have ever made the back nine at Kiele. More 
people have been to the North Pole than the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
As if it's not tough enough, every time you get a good lie, it starts to rain. 
The drinks aren't the only things that need umbrellas. But the natives assure 
you these are just showers. They seldom last more than two days. One old-timer 
told me they got a place there where it rains more than it does anywhere else 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," I told him. "And they stuck a pin in it and called it 18. It's the 
only hole in the world where you need a driver, a seven-iron, two wedges and a 
canoe." 
</P>
<P>
They named one hole -- a 459-yard par-4 into the wind -- the Rabbit. So, you 
can imagine what the hole called the Gorilla is like. Something they pulled off 
the Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
I played with Sammy White, the old Red Sox catcher, up in Princeville, and 
Sammy calls me Shakespeare, in honor of my calling, as in: "Well, Shakespeare, 
you better tee up another one, as that one's just passed the Lahaina Roads. Use 
an old ball if you've got one." 
</P>
<P>
Sammy plays golf with a pith helmet, a big cigar and a smother hook. Sammy once 
hit a grand slam bottom-of-the-10th home run off Satchel Paige, so it is not 
too surprising to find him out here, beachcombing out of the company of 
civilized men. A man who would do that would throw a brick through a Rembrandt. 
It is reliably reported to be the last ball Sammy hit in fair territory 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
At Kiele, I played with Frank Sullivan, the old Red Sox pitcher and Sammy 
White's battery mate. Frank won 18 games one year and might have been a Cy 
Young candidate if he could ever have gotten Vic Wertz out. As one-time Boston 
sportswriter Clif Keane used to say, "Even if Frank didn't let go of the ball, 
Wertz would have doubled off him." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was a control pitcher on the mound, but he's lost the strike zone over 
the years. He hits sliders off the tee now that not even Wertz could get a bat 
on. 
</P>
<P>
While you're on vacation, out of touch with the commercial realities, you hope 
the world will change -- for the better. You hope people will stop killing each 
other, politicians will stop lying, colleges will stop cheating, Mike Tyson 
will lose a round, and the Cubs will stay up there. You get to be a kind of 
Pollyanna, listening to all those trade winds and ukulele strings. 
</P>
<P>
I had hoped to come home to find the Clippers had signed Danny Ferry or traded 
him for an all-world guard, hoped that the Dodgers were in first, the Angels 
pulling away, that maybe the Raiders got a quarterback, a golf tournament was 
won by somebody you heard of, that they found that Pete Rose only bet on dog 
races, maybe we won a Davis Cup or John McEnroe had apologized to the world and 
Don King got a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
Alas! The world is still a testy par-5 over water with poison ivy in the rough, 
an alligator in the sand trap and the pin cut over a cliff with the ocean at 
the bottom. The world is an unplayable lie. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry is not going to play for the Clippers, although I do think he 
overreacted, signing with Messaggero to play in Rome, Italy. Kansas City 
probably would have been far enough. But Danny is taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers thought they had won Danny Ferry in the lottery, but you know how 
those mail lotteries are. Probably had Ed McMahon's picture on it. That's all 
the Clippers do win -- lotteries. Games, they haven't got the hang of. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are trying to win the pennant with a whole bunch of left fielders 
and not much else. One of our guys finally won a British Open, our first in 
seven years, but a Brazilian won Indy, so that's a push. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I should go back on vacation, give the world another two weeks to shape 
up. All things considered, I'd rather be back on Kiele, lying six on a par-5 
hole and not yet to the dogleg, and Sammy White talking on my backswing, 
telling me what kind of a pitch he hit off Satchel, which is like Marciano 
telling you what kind of a punch knocked out Joe Louis or the captain of the 
Titanic telling you what course hit the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Back here in the real world, all kinds of terrible things keep being possible. 
New York might get in the World Series, for instance. If so, the guy I saw in 
the airport at Lihue is ready. He had a T-shirt that read: "New York, N.Y., 
Attitude Capital of the World." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't want to go home, either.

MIKE DOWNEY: UNBEATEN NUNN STILL HAS TITLE BUT NOT MUCH STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
HE TOOK HIS LUMPS FROM THE CROWD

Michael Nunn: "I didn't need to win no last round! I could have done nothin' in 
the last round and still won!" 
</P>
<P>
Iran Barkley: "Aw, man! You know who was fightin' in that last round and who 
wasn't!" 
</P>
<P>
Nunn: "I manhandled Iran Barkley! Ask him!" 
</P>
<P>
Barkley: "Shhhh . . . man, you never hurt me! You hit like a flower!" 
</P>
<P>
Nunn: "Yeah? Then why you all lumped up?" 
</P>
<P>
Barkley: "I might be lumped up, but I lumped you up, too!" 
</P>
<P>
Nunn: "Yeah? Where? Ain't a mark on me! Where you lump me up?" 
</P>
<P>
Barkley: "You lumped up." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn: "From a head butt, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley: "Yeah. Uh huh. Whatever you say, Mike. Whatever you say." 
</P>
<P>
So ended the circus-circus of Monday night's middleweight championship fight 
between North Hollywood's Michael Nunn, who apparently was too Hollywood for 
Nevada's tastes, and the South Bronx's Iran Barkley, who fought the fight with 
the crowd on his side, then discussed the fight with an ice pack on his skull. 
</P>
<P>
The man they call "Second To" outpointed the man whose chances were supposed to 
be Slim And. Nunn called Barkley worse names before the fight, insisting that 
he had "the IQ of an onion," promising he was going to make this Bronx bull 
weep. Barkley's response was understandable. He said he intended to kill 
Michael Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, then, that the Blade had a headache at bout's end. This was not 
the first time a controversial decision had gone against him. Happened when he 
took Roberto Duran the distance, too. Oh, sure, his eyelid was swollen, his 
lower lip was blood-stained, his cranium was lumped up, but as far as he was 
concerned, it was the decision that wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
This was the end of a long, long day for Barkley, who literally stripped 
himself naked to make sure the fight came off. 
</P>
<P>
At the morning weigh-in, after Nunn checked in at 159 pounds, Barkley stepped 
on the scale, wearing only his Fruit of the Looms, and heard a figure that made 
him wince: "160 1/4." 
</P>
<P>
He whispered into the ear of Jay Edson, the event coordinator for Top Rank 
boxing. Edson then made an announcement: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Barkley has decided to take off his underwear before being weighed again, 
so, if there are any ladies in the audience who would care to turn away, feel 
free at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Some did, some didn't. The Blade got on the scale, and suddenly his weight was 
160 on the nose. Oh, the problems we men have with those quarter-pounder 
underpants. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, at least Barkley was a hollow reed compared to Roberto (Waist of Stone) 
Duran, who fought a few exhibition rounds on the undercard, much to the 
amusement of those who were thinking about buying tickets for Duran's Dec. 7 
fight against Sugar Ray Leonard. Somebody might have telephoned the Reno Zoo to 
see if the baby hippopotamus had accidentally wandered out. Duran was that fat. 
</P>
<P>
After waddling around in his XXXL black-velvet trunks for a while, Refrigerator 
Duran stuck his head through the ropes in the direction of Leonard, who was 
ringside, smiled through his mouthpiece and muttered, "No mas champagne." 
</P>
<P>
In far better shape was Barkley, who was ready for this scaled-down version of 
Ali-Frazier that he and Nunn were about to stage. Barkley is a fighter who does 
not know how to step backward. Nunn is a dancer who is tired of having it 
misinterpreted as cowardice. Nunn was eager to prove he could mix. I'll rock 
Iran, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He brought to his corner his usual collection of California friends, from San 
Francisco 49er running back Roger Craig to the jewel-bedecked Mr. T, not to 
forget that gaggle of Goossens in his corner. Whether it was this entourage 
that alienated the Lawlor Events Center audience or the tactics that had Nunn 
backpedaling and rope-a-doping, conserving strength, something caused the crowd 
to turn against him, and there were constant chants of "Barkley! Barkley!" 
</P>
<P>
Nunn landed far more punches, maybe twice as many, but never once sent Barkley 
sagging or reeling. The Blade laughed in his face, dared him to fight, goaded 
him into some display of pretend manhood that would not have served Nunn well. 
</P>
<P>
At the final and fatal (for Barkley) 12th round's start, he was insulting Nunn, 
daring him to step closer, wondering why the man was dancing three feet away 
with a championship belt on the line. "Why you 'way over there?" Barkley yelled 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn responded by popping him in the facial area with eight consecutive rights, 
and this gave him the round on all three judges' cards, and in turn gave him 
the fight. Had Barkley won the round, it would have ended a draw, same as that 
other middleweight fight between Thomas Hearns and Leonard did, and would have 
had the same exasperating effect on the fight game. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn pulled it out, though. Then he made out like it shouldn't even have been 
close. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I won the fight hands down," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley shook his head, as though the man must be crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, give the man credit," the Blade said, lifting up his fist. "He knew if he 
got hit by this, he'd be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Or at least lumped.

SALONEN: 'SO MANY POSSIBILITIES'; 
</P>
<P>
FINNISH CONDUCTOR GETS 3-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's official. In a press conference at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Monday 
morning, the Los Angeles Philharmonic presented Esa-Pekka Salonen as the new 
music director-elect of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Connell, president of the Philharmonic board, introduced the 
31-year-old Finnish conductor in a conference room packed with media 
representatives. With Connell were trombonist Jeffrey Reynolds -- who spoke 
briefly -- and flutist Roland Moritz, who represented the Philharmonic 
musicians on the search committee, and Ernest Fleischmann, Philharmonic 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really very greatly honored, and very excited about this project," Salonen 
said. "The artistic potential is enormous." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's term begins with the 1992-93 season. His three-year contract calls 
for him to be in residence 16 weeks a year, two of those at Hollywood Bowl. No 
financial details were released. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1987-88 season, former music director Andre Previn was paid $581,550, 
an $80,000 raise over the previous season. Previn was named to the post in 
April, 1984, after the resignation of Carlo Maria Giulini. He took over the 
podium in January, 1986, and his initial contract, calling for at least 14 
weeks of residence with the orchestra per season, ran through the end of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Previn signed a contract extension which would have continued his 
directorship through the 1990-91 season. Renewal of that contract, due by June, 
was considered unlikely according to members of the Philharmonic board of 
directors. That, Fleischmann suggested, prompted the timing of Previn's 
resignation in April. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen will be sharing musical influence over the orchestra with Previn before 
his accession to the podium in 1992. When Previn resigned, he announced that he 
would continue with the orchestra as a guest conductor. He will return for 
seven weeks in the 1989-90 season, and six weeks each in 1990-91 and 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
With an already full calendar, Salonen will be here for only one week in the 
coming season. Fleischmann said that Salonen will conduct at least four weeks 
of concerts in the 1990-91 season, and "at least as much" the following year. 
He also said plans were being made for a major tour that Salonen would lead. 
</P>
<P>
In his introduction, Connell said that Salonen wanted to avoid such a public 
meeting if possible, reminding everyone that English is not Salonen's native 
tongue. Salonen spoke clearly, earnestly and somewhat nervously, deferring 
answers to questions about his impact on Philharmonic repertory and outreach 
until he has a chance to study what has been done in the past. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what led him to accept the Philharmonic post, Salonen said "the most 
important thing is the quality of the orchestra." He will be in charge of all 
artistic matters, including programming, personnel, guest artists, and touring. 
He will also have input in the planning of Disney Hall, and met with architect 
Frank Gehry Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen did say that he is definitely interested in conducting opera here. He 
also continues to compose, when he can find the time. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment," he said, "I am working on a piece for the London Sinfonietta 
-- which was supposed to have been played three years ago!"

SALONEN: 'SO MANY POSSIBILITIES'; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC DIRECTOR CONTEMPLATES HIS FUTURE WITH PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the appointed hour on Monday -- an indecently early hour -- Esa-Pekka 
Salonen personally answers the door to his suite in a chic Sunset Strip hotel. 
He doesn't travel with major-domos. 
</P>
<P>
The incipient 31-year-old music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic looks 
tired and a bit befuddled. Pink shadows around his eyes contradict his boyish 
image. A lost glob of shaving cream still ornaments his ear. As he talks, he 
nervously touches his face with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
He has endured a busy weekend and is very much on display. He arrived, 
jet-lagged, late on Saturday, met with local officialdom on Sunday, and is 
about to brave an introductory breakfast with members of his orchestra-to-be. 
An official meeting with the massed media is to follow. 
</P>
<P>
He musters a semblance of graceful bonhomie under pressure. He is eager, 
however, to get back to Europe to salvage what remains of his two-week 
vacation. The opening of the symphony season looms in Stockholm, as do some 
important recording dates. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, however, the obsessive subject has to be Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He is curious as to how word of his appointment had oozed beyond the usual 
news-control barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it because my management refused to arrange an interview?" he wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen's personal management had indeed rebuffed all requests for a 
conversation, ever since Andre Previn acrimoniously announced his resignation 
in April. An obvious favorite from the start among the possible candidates, the 
Finnish guest had never been shy of the press in the past. It was a clue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been negotiating since May," he admits. "I signed my copy of the 
contract five days ago." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations with Los Angeles apparently were not difficult. "I don't think 
the process was complex," he says in perfect, slightly brittle English, "but 
this is the first time I have done anything like this. I have no point of 
reference." 
</P>
<P>
His only comparable job at the moment is leadership of the Stockholm Radio 
Symphony. He has not yet decided if he will give it up when he comes here. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important post in Scandinavia," he explains when prodded, "but 
Los Angeles is more in the public eye." 
</P>
<P>
He dispatches the basic questions efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, of course he is delighted to be named the 11th permanent conductor here. 
He loves the orchestra, enjoys a good rapport with the audience, looks forward 
to working with managing director Ernest Fleischmann, and his team, sees this 
opportunity as a great adventure. New arrivals always say things like that. 
</P>
<P>
His initial contract calls for 16 weeks here each season for three years 
beginning in 1992. That fundamental commitment includes appearances at the 
Hollywood Bowl, recordings and tours. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it were possible to be here more but my calendar is already full. I 
will arrange to be here for a substantial time after the 1990 season, but next 
season (1989-90) I can only come for a week in December." 
</P>
<P>
Although his predecessor cited managerial interference as his reason for 
leaving, Salonen says he foresees no such problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I get along very well with Ernest Fleischmann. He has been very supportive 
from the beginning. I feel his experience and expertise can be very useful. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there has to be a division of labor. The music director is the one 
who makes the artistic decisions. All contracts with American orchestras 
specify that. Still, I can delegate some authority. There has to be 
cooperation, collaboration. One shouldn't think of this in terms of using 
power. The important thing is the result. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He remains diplomatic regarding the Previn-Fleischmann imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot comment on what happened. I met Previn a few times, like him very 
much and respect him as a conductor." 
</P>
<P>
The recent unpleasantness between maestro and management does not make him 
uncomfortable. "I have not thought in those terms," he says. "My feeling is, 
the only thing I can do is work hard. If that is enough, fine. If not -- well, 
I have not planned any strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Salonen says it is premature to ask him about his musical 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I will now go through the programs from the last 10 years and see what the 
gaps are. I will see what is needed, program-wise. The actual planning starts 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent consideration is the choice of conductors. It is very 
important, I think, to keep a close relationship with (principal guest 
conductor) Simon Rattle. It is important for me -- he is a good friend -- and 
it is important for the orchestra and the audience. I want him to continue to 
do as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the nice things about Los Angeles is the list of conductors who appear 
here on a regular basis -- (Pierre) Boulez, (Kurt) Sanderling, (Zubin) Mehta. 
Not many orchestras in the world can present that sort of list every year. Of 
course, I will take advantage of this, and try to find the best guest 
conductors." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen just conducted a controversial production of Debussy's "Pelleas" in 
Florence. He hopes to expand his operatic horizons further while in Los 
Angeles, he says somewhat enigmatically. 
</P>
<P>
"I am doing more and more opera," he adds. "This is important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen calls London home, keeps a flat in Stockholm and likes to hide out in a 
coastal cottage near Helsinki. Unmarried, he doesn't know yet where he will 
live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He found the Philharmonic offer seductive, he says -- after a smile and a 
thoughtful pause -- for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the orchestra very much. There is enormous potential here. This 
orchestra could be as good as any in the world. I felt that from my first visit 
(in 1984). I appreciate the flexibility in style and sound that they can 
produce. There are so many possibilities. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
That noun usually suggests the existence of areas that could be improved. 
Salonen hedges for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I haven't been here for 1 1/2 years. I'm not sure how the orchestra 
sounds at the moment. I will probably want to work on the dynamic range. I like 
pianissimo playing. I value transparency." 
</P>
<P>
How badly, one asks, did he want to be a music director? 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't want it badly," he answers without missing a beat, "I wouldn't be 
here. At first I liked the idea of guest conducting. Then the frustrations got 
to me -- the waste of energy, the inability to achieve the highest musical 
standards in a short time, the fact that one had to move on just as 
communication would become fruitful." 
</P>
<P>
Some observers of the international conducting sweepstakes had feared that the 
Big Orange might lose Salonen to the Big Apple, where Mehta recently resigned 
his post with the New York Philharmonic. Salonen denies the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no offer," he insists. "There were no negotiations. The rumors were 
obviously false." Subject closed. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't seem particularly worried about a conflict between his own modernist 
tendencies -- he actually composes when he isn't conducting -- and the 
conservative preferences of the local audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The Philharmonic has several special series devoted to contemporary music. 
That is encouraging. I believe in mixing the new and the old. It is important 
to give a feeling of continuity, to create a historical context for the 
audiences. There is much more energy if the classical repertory and the 
avant-garde are performed together. It isn't the only way. Contemporary 
concerts are important. But it is a very useful way." 
</P>
<P>
He flashes a painful smile when reminded that Thursday night subscribers once 
hooted and walked out when Simon Rattle dared program the Shostakovich 14th. 
</P>
<P>
"That has never happened to me yet," he says with a sigh. "If it did, I would 
get very upset emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
He is not above talking to audiences from the podium, and he approves of 
pre-performance lectures. "It is good if one can show the audience certain 
links and directions," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen has given up his erstwhile ambitions as a horn player, but he hopes to 
devote at least five months a year to composing. He has no qualms about 
describing his own music. 
</P>
<P>
"Post-serialism is the starting point, but without rigid mathematics. I am more 
liberal in approach. I am clearly influenced by some elements in contemporary 
American music. The minimalist movement isn't my style, but certain so-called 
minimalist sounds, certain colors and ways to manipulate music fascinate me." 
</P>
<P>
He professes various degrees of admiration for John Adams, Terry Riley and 
Steve Reich. Then comes the dreaded name -- Philip Glass. 
</P>
<P>
He shakes his head, squints his eyes. "Not my cup of tea." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen intends to program a good deal of Scandinavian music during his tenure, 
especially the much neglected symphonies of Carl Nielsen. But he won't overlook 
the domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to learn a lot about contemporary music in the States," he says as he 
prepares for his next appointment. "I have to see what there is. I have to 
achieve the right balance." 
</P>
<P>
His name, by the way, is no more daunting than he is. The authentic 
pronunciation, we are assured, is ESSa-PECKa SALonen -- the accent always 
falling on the first syllable. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles will be hearing that name often.

CRITIC AT LARGE: FOR LUISE RAINER, POSSIBLY A RETURN TO HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was in Los Angeles on a visit in 1987, Luise Rainer mused about a 
career that, more than most, could be described as meteoric, in both 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
She had been discovered in Vienna in 1935 by an MGM scout who saw her on stage 
in "An American Tragedy." Her first Hollywood film, "Escapade," in 1936 
(written by Herman Mankiewicz, directed by Robert Z. Leonard, co-starring 
William Powell), made her a star. 
</P>
<P>
She made eight films in three years. Amazingly, she won Academy Awards as best 
actress in successive years, for "The Great Ziegfeld" (1936) and "The Good 
Earth" (1937), a feat no one has equalled since. 
</P>
<P>
But there followed some roles, which for the most part she hated, in lesser 
films, and suffered a disastrous three-year marriage to playwright Clifford 
Odets, which finally ended in 1940. Less than a decade after she arrived in 
Hollywood she left for good, and she has acted only sporadically since then. 
</P>
<P>
"In my first three films," she said one day last week during another visit to 
her daughter, Francesca Bowyer, in Beverly Hills, "I played a governess, a 
tempestuous actress and an old Chinese woman. Louis B. Mayer, who was not one 
of my favorite men, said, 'My God, that woman is hard to cast.' I was so 
foreign to them in every way. They didn't understand me and I didn't understand 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Hollywood too early, I think. Now actors can take only the roles they 
want to do. When you were under contract, you had to do roles whether you liked 
them or not. I fought. I was not so much glamorous as clamorous. I was full of 
fire and enthusiasm and very hard on myself." 
</P>
<P>
Then it was over. But life has its compensations. In 1946, she married Robert 
Knittel, the only son of a Swiss novelist and himself a cosmopolitan figure in 
the world of publishing: editorial director of the major English firm Collins 
and publisher of authors as various as Sidney Sheldon, Herman Wouk, Carlos 
Fuentes and Jean Renoir ("Renoir, My Father"). 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined to make a successful marriage, and I did," Rainer says. They 
were married for 45 years, until June of this year, when he died in Locarno, 
Switzerland, where they had moved from London after he retired in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
They had traveled widely, had in fact visited India, China and Thailand in the 
months before his illness struck. Sicily and the Balkans were on their agenda 
for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Now she will close their Swiss house and resettle in London or Los Angeles. 
"But who can afford Los Angeles?" she asks. "My old house in Brentwood is now 
worth $4 million." 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling simply to live with her memories, Rainer hopes, at the age of 79, to 
work again. A few years ago she did a successful one-woman show of "Enoch 
Arden," performing to good reviews at UCLA and in New York among other places. 
</P>
<P>
She has also filmed her segment in London of a six-episode film in which an 
international company of women examine the situations of women alone. Glenda 
Jackson has done a segment, she understands, and Jeanne Moreau is supposed to 
do one, all under the aegis of Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
She has had a one-woman show of her paintings and she has written the first 300 
pages of an autobiography, up to the early Hollywood days, when her social life 
included the likes of Thomas Mann, Jascha Heifetz, Franz Werfel, Bertolt Brecht 
and Arnold Schoenberg. 
</P>
<P>
But when she got to the Odets years, she says, "I developed a writer's block, a 
very big writer's block." Whether she will return to the autobiography she is 
not certain, although her daughter says loyally that it is "wonderful and 
poetic." 
</P>
<P>
Like any actress, she thinks of the roles she didn't do. Rainer says Franz 
Werfel hoped she might do his "The Song of Bernadette." She would have liked to 
do "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and, most particularly, "Madame Curie." But her 
relations with MGM, where her friend Sidney Franklin produced "Curie," were 
already strained. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Mr. Mayer I would have loved to make 'Johnny Belinda' (a Warner film in 
which Jane Wyman played a woman deaf and mute). He said, 'My God, we're making 
talkies these days; what would you want to do that for?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said my source has dried out. He said, 'What do you need a source for; 
you've got a director, haven't you?' " 
</P>
<P>
So she and MGM parted, and she left, as she says, "to be engulfed by a great 
romance." Now the romance is memory, and she would like to find again the 
engulfing romance of work.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: BROKAW, NBC NEWS TARGET GANG WARS ON L.A. STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Gangs, Cops &amp; Drugs" solidifies this city's reputation as America's 
Beirut. It's a dispiriting survey of homeboys and dead boys on the streets of 
Los Angeles, where routine arbitrary killings and duels of "heavy weapons to 
the death," Tom Brokaw notes, have turned some neighborhoods into nightmarish 
war zones of terror. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 10 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39, it's an arresting hour, because 
human conflict and tragedy inevitably draw our attention and because the threat 
so vividly characterized here is frighteningly real. 
</P>
<P>
For residents of Los Angeles and perhaps other urban centers where innocent 
casualties are the terrible growing legacy of street combat, however, tonight's 
"Gangs, Cops &amp; Drugs" offers far fewer revelations than affirmations. Its 
message of hopelessness and scenes of chaos and bloodshed, suffering guiltless 
and angry perpetrators are disturbingly familiar. We've been through this 
endless dark tunnel before, in newscasts and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
NBC will take a panel-discussion approach to the same set of problems in a 
follow-up hour at 10 p.m. Wednesday, with Brokaw moderating a live forum 
linking guests in several cities. Among the participants are Portland Mayor Bud 
Clark, who has called in the Oregon National Guard to combat gang and drug 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
NBC called in Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
At least it seems so at times, as he rides around with police and gets down 
with the locals. The camera captures the bush-jacketed "NBC Nightly News" 
anchorman out on the pavement of South-Central Los Angeles, under a billboard 
advertising malt liquor, in deep dialogue with 99th Mafia gang members El Dog, 
Chuckie, Rat and Bitter Child. 
</P>
<P>
Bitter Child: "This is me. This is where I grew up at. This is my roots right 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw: "But it can be dangerous. Isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Bitter Child: "Livin' is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard putting much stock in any conversation gang members would have out in 
the open on national TV, especially with someone as famous and alien to their 
world as Brokaw. Such are the limits of TV cameras and celebrity journalists. 
</P>
<P>
What "Gangs, Cops &amp; Drugs" does best is define the roots, complexities and 
growing perils of gang violence on a human level, noting that there is more to 
the dilemma than Crips vs. Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
There are the inevitable drug busts here that make good TV. And the 
destructiveness of that favored street weapon, the AK-47, is demonstrated in a 
way not to be forgotten. Far more striking, however, are the intensely personal 
moments: from a teacher who operates out of a library because her classroom was 
vandalized, from a policeman who speaks emotionally about the plight young 
children who may become gang members, and from a little boy who rejects gangs 
as "dumb." 
</P>
<P>
Will he suffer repercussions for saying that on camera? As you watch this 
program, worry mingles with frustration and despair.

IRAN'S NEW PRESIDENT FACES MAJOR ECONOMIC HEADACHE; 
</P>
<P>
NATION LACKS RESOURCES TO REBUILD AFTER IRAQI WAR BUT ISLAM FROWNS ON FOREIGN 
LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NICOSIA, Cyprus 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battered and bled by a grinding, eight-year war and constricted by the politics 
of religion, the economy of Iran presents Hashemi Rafsanjani with the toughest 
challenge of his new presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his Aug. 3 inauguration, Rafsanjani announced in a sermon in 
Tehran that he has a crash program with long- and short-term policies to revive 
limping factories, restore the petroleum industry, provide work for the jobless 
and put goods on the empty shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"Within one year," the 55-year-old clergyman-politician declared, the 
government "will prepare the necessary facilities for all of our existing 
factories to reach their full capacities." They are currently operating at 20% 
to 30% of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, he said, the government will move "to improve the lives of the 
deprived people . . . for whom it is not fair to live another decade in 
austerity." And, he added confidently: "I am sure the Majlis (Iran's 
Parliament) will cooperate in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Loans Required 
</P>
<P>
There's the rub. Before and after his July 28 election, Rafsanjani dropped loud 
hints that he would turn to the West for help. Iran's slogan of independence is 
"neither East nor West," but even before his election the pragmatic president 
had gone East, nailing down a series of development and military deals in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
A similar approach to the West will require foreign loans. Economic analysts 
figure that Iran will need at least $100 billion above current revenue to meet 
its development goals over the next 10 years. And borrowing abroad is repugnant 
under the Islamic code of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The Majlis, with a strong contingent of strict fundamentalists, will test 
Rafsanjani's persuasive powers when it takes up the government's five-year 
economic plan in the weeks ahead. Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi 
bluntly laid out the hard-line, xenophobic view in an interview with the Tehran 
Times: "Iranians would rather observe a fast than surrender to creditors who 
want to impose terms and conditions on us." 
</P>
<P>
So far, under a decade of revolutionary Islamic rule, Mohtashemi's attitude has 
prevailed: By the government's unusual method of calculating what it owes, Iran 
has long-term foreign debts of little more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soaring Inflation 
</P>
<P>
So what is the problem in a developing country that ranks among the world's top 
oil producers, carries a foreign debt that looks like pocket change compared to 
Brazil's and Mexico's and has a private sector with capital to invest if it had 
the confidence? Plenty. 
</P>
<P>
* Inflation is soaring. The government puts it as 23%, but outside analysts 
estimate that it is double that. Shopkeepers have been ordered to fix and tag 
the prices of the few goods they have for sale, but higher offers bring items 
out from under the counter. Civil servants have not had a raise in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
* The currency is out of whack. Recent visitors to Tehran say black market 
dealers were giving 1,400 rials to $1, while the official dollar rate was 73 
rials. Coupon books for subsidized goods for the poor, once issued monthly, 
have been distributed bimonthly at best. 
</P>
<P>
* Petroleum facilities were badly damaged by Iraqi bombing in the war that 
ended last August, crippling an industry already punished by the oil price 
collapse of 1985. Overall, war damage to the Iranian economy has been estimated 
at $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Unemployment is 15% to 20% by unofficial estimates, not bad considering the 
devastation of the war. But, as is the case in other developing countries, 
population and urbanization bombs are ticking in Iran. Economics Minister Javad 
Iravani recently disclosed that the population growth rate is 3.9%, compared to 
2.4% before the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah. 
</P>
<P>
* Power plants were heavily hit in the fighting, and blackouts are common in 
Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after the long and enervating war and the tense political struggle for 
succession to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranians are looking to 
Rafsanjani, who won 94% of the presidential vote against a token opposition 
candidate, to fulfill his campaign promises of economic progress. 
</P>
<P>
"The war's over. Public expectations are rising," Vahe Petrossian, who covers 
Iran for the respected Middle East Economic Digest, explained in an interview 
in his London offices. "He (Rafsanjani) has to initiate policy. He has to show 
some authority." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loans From Soviets 
</P>
<P>
The question of foreign loans will top the docket. Iravani, the economics 
minister, told the Tehran monthly journal Iqtesad that Iran should rely as much 
as possible on domestic capital but added: "We must deal realistically with 
borrowing from foreign sources far from political ballyhoo." He estimated 
Iran's present foreign reserves at $6 billion to $7 billion, including gold. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Soviet Railways Minister Nikolai Konarev was in Tehran to discuss a 
Soviet offer of $1.9 billion in credits to finance joint industrial projects. 
The friendly interest rate, he said, would be 1.5%. Iravani said the total 
economic package approved by Rafsanjani in Moscow involved a $2-billion Iranian 
debt to the Soviets, which will be paid back by shipments of natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
The Economist Intelligence Unit, a London-based publication, estimates that the 
current Iranian budget totals about $4 billion in foreign "borrowings," 
including $2.4 billion in credits for supplies tied to specific industrial 
projects and the rest in short-term financing. The credits, never termed loans, 
have been arranged with European banks and are drawn against future oil 
deliveries. The political disguise of the term leaves the official foreign debt 
at the $500 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restoring Oil Production 
</P>
<P>
Deals pinned down by the Iranians with China and other countries involve barter 
for Iranian petroleum products, the bulwark of an export economy that otherwise 
leans on a high-priced assortment of Oriental carpets, pistachio nuts and 
caviar. Non-oil exports declined 11% in the year ending last March, totaling 
less than $1 billion, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
Direct trade with the United States appears to be politically out of the 
picture for now, although Petrossian said some British-based American companies 
are interested in industrial projects in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum revenue for this year is expected to reach $11 billion, with Iranian 
production expected to fill the quota set by the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries. Restoration of oil facilities was the top priority of 
industrial planners, who put 6,000 workers to the task of repairing the 
war-wrecked refinery at Abadan and got the first export shipment out in early 
May. 
</P>
<P>
With $11 billion or $12 billion in annual foreign exchange revenue, plus some 
visible or invisible borrowing, Rafsanjani will be hard pressed to stretch his 
resources to cover the need. 
</P>
<P>
Heino Kopietz, an Iran specialist with the International Institute of Strategic 
Studies in London, said in an interview that the government will spend $4 
billion to $5 billion this year -- and for years ahead -- to rebuild its 
military, which remains at full personnel strength but is under-equipped in the 
face of a war halted only by a truce. "The military cannot stand naked," 
Kopietz remarked, "and they see the Iraqis loading up again." 
</P>
<P>
With the demands for rearmament, rebuilding industry and importation of 
required raw materials, there is little or nothing left to alleviate the 
immediate needs of the Iranian people. They may have to wait for the engine of 
the economy to get going again. Such politically explosive questions as land 
redistribution will probably be put in abeyance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'What Is Practicable' 
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Majid Qassemi told a recent Tehran news conference that 
the government would spend $4.8 billion during the current year on imported 
food and consumer goods but did not disclose how that target could be achieved 
in the face of industrial and military demands. Rafsanjani has been more 
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a series of hopes for the future of the country that may or may not 
square with the potentials at hand," Iran's official news agency quoted the new 
president as saying last month. "I will try to realize what is practicable." 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times, a Rafsanjani supporter, advised in an editorial: "We would be 
doing Rafsanjani a disservice if we do not temper with wise moderation a 
too-exaggerated hope in what he can accomplish by an excessive adulation of 
him. . . . To overreach ourselves in expecting miracles -- which of course have 
their proper place in the scheme of things -- would be to hurt him."

K MART PROFIT FALLS 10.9% IN QUARTER; LOWER SALES CITED

<P>
K mart Corp., faced with increased competition from such sources as Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc., on Monday reported a 10.9% decline in its second-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
The company said lower-than-expected sales in May and higher interest payments 
led to the drop. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's second-largest retailer behind Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said its 
second-quarter profit came to $145 million on revenue of $7.01 billion during 
the period ended July 26. That compared to earnings of $162.8 million on 
revenue of $6.68 billion during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended July 26, the company's profits were down 15.7%, 
falling to $239.1 million from $283.6 million during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the period this year totaled $13.07 billion, up 4.4% from last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tough Market' 
</P>
<P>
"In the first quarter, we were disappointed by K mart's earnings and we 
attributed it to Sears Roebuck and the heavy promotion they had for their new 
everyday pricing," said analyst Sally Schaadt of Fourteen Research in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole area (of discount retailing) has become extremely competitive," she 
said. "It's a tough market." 
</P>
<P>
K mart Chairman Joseph E. Antonini said his company's sales in May fell below 
expectations and the cost of borrowing money was higher in the period. 
</P>
<P>
He said things should pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, as the 
company develops stronger merchandising programs and increases the use of a 
companywide computer link to monitor sales. 
</P>
<P>
K mart operated 4,135 outlets at the end of the period, including K mart 
discount stores, Waldenbooks, Builders Square and Pay Less Drug stores.

DREXEL MAKES SETTLEMENT WITH 10 STATES

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the embattled investment banker that agreed to 
plead guilty to federal securities fraud charges, said Monday that it reached 
settlements to keep operating in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's agreement to plead guilty to securities crimes leaves it open to 
actions by states that can now claim that the investment banker broke their 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
States can move to revoke Drexel's license and some have the authority to ask 
for heavy fines, reimbursement costs and for funds to finance investor 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the firm is negotiating with a majority of states, some say they may 
still revoke its license. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements reached so far, Drexel has paid a total of $975,000 in 
fines and penalties to keep operating. The firm hopes to reach settlements with 
other states and expects that it will end up paying about $11.5 million in all. 
</P>
<P>
However, Drexel is still not out of the woods, said Susan Bryant who heads a 
committee of securities regulators that developed a draft agreement for states 
to follow in their negotiations with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
"Three (states) have told me directly they are still contemplating revoking 
Drexel's license," Bryant said. Bryant is administrator of the Oklahoma 
Department of Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant would not name the states because of ongoing negotiations.

JUDGE ALLOWS NORTHROP FRAUD SUIT TO CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge in Los Angeles has rejected a plea by Northrop to throw out a civil 
fraud case filed by a group of current and former employees who allege that the 
aerospace firm overcharged the government by at least $2 billion on the B-2 
Stealth bomber project. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer upheld the constitutionality of a 
section of the False Claims Act that permits private citizens with knowledge of 
a fraud against the government to sue on behalf of the United States. Pfaelzer 
filed a written opinion late Friday and her court clerk made it public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision is the third ruling by a federal district judge in 
California this year upholding the constitutionality of 1986 amendments to the 
False Claims Act that greatly enhanced incentives for whistle-blowers to come 
forward and disclose fraudulent schemes. The other two rulings were issued in a 
Los Angeles case involving McDonnell Douglas and in a San Jose case involving 
Lockheed. There also are constitutional challenges to the law pending in other 
Los Angeles cases involving Northrop and Litton Industries. 
</P>
<P>
One current and three former Northrop employees filed suit early last year in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles asserting that the company overcharged the 
government by at least $2 billion for expenses incurred in the development and 
building of the Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The False Claims Act was originally enacted during the Civil War when President 
Abraham Lincoln was attempting to curb fraud against the government by 
contractors who were selling the United States inferior products, such as 
gunpowder adulterated with sawdust. The law was substantially amended in 1986 
and there are now about 200 cases pending in federal courts around the country 
brought under it, most of them involving alleged defense fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The False Claims Act, as amended, provides that the Justice Department may 
elect to take over a case filed by a whistle-blower if it decides that the case 
has merit. The government then shares any damages it wins with the original 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The government has declined to join this case against Northrop. However, in 
July, the Justice Department announced that it is conducting an investigation 
into possible fraud by Northrop on the Stealth bomber program. At the time, 
Justice Department sources said the investigation concerned possible 
overbilling on the project, which thus far has cost the government $23 billion. 
Government officials specifically said that the inquiry did not involve any 
questionable parts or the operational ability of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Northrop's attorneys asserted that the so-called whistle-blower 
provisions added to the False Claims Act in 1986 were unconstitutional because 
they violated Article III of the Constitution on what is necessary to have 
standing to sue, the separation of powers doctrine and the appointments clause 
of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In the ruling filed Friday, Pfaelzer rejected all three arguments. 
</P>
<P>
First, she said Congress has the authority to give a private citizen the power 
to file a fraud case on behalf of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Next, she said the whistle-blower provisions do not violate the separation of 
powers clause. They do not undermine executive branch power, she said, because 
the U.S. attorney general can take over such cases. Pfaelzer also noted that if 
the attorney general decides not to enter the case, he retains the power to 
monitor the proceedings and can intervene with good cause and can block a 
settlement the government finds unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she said the statute does not violate the appointments clause because 
the private citizen plaintiff in such cases is given limited prosecutorial 
authority in a specific case, not any permanent power. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Hafif, the Claremont attorney who represents the plaintiffs in the 
Stealth bomber case, said he was pleased by Pfaelzer's ruling and that he hopes 
the Justice Department will reconsider its decision not to join the private 
plaintiffs in prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop attorneys declined to comment on the ruling.

DORFMAN PART OF SEC PROBE, MAGAZINE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether USA Today 
business columnist Dan Dorfman may have been used to manipulate the prices of 
stocks he has written about, a news magazine reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The reported investigation focuses on whether Centaur Partners, a 
Maryland-based investment partnership that has established small initial 
positions in several prominent companies, may be manipulating the stocks of 
those companies, U.S. News &amp; World Report said in its latest edition. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC is seeking to determine whether Dorfman, who has written about 
Centaur's stock forays often during the past 14 months, has knowingly or 
unknowingly been used to drive up prices of those stocks, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
When Dorfman reported that Centaur was buying stock in such companies as B. F. 
Goodrich and Pennwalt, the shares rose on speculation of possible takeovers. 
The reported probe centers on whether Centaur was in turn selling the stock to 
investors, who then suffered losses when a bid did not materialize, the 
magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SEC in Washington would not comment, saying it is the 
agency's policy not to confirm or to deny the existence of any investigation. 
</P>
<P>
No one is accusing Dorfman of personally profiting from information in his 
columns, and he emphatically denied in a telephone interview that he has been 
used in efforts to manipulate stock prices.

H-P Sees Lower Third-Quarter Profits: Hewlett-Packard Co. said its 
third-quarter earnings would be below Wall Street analysts' expectations, 
causing the firm's stock to fall $2.50 to $52.75 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. Hewlett-Packard said it expects to report quarterly earnings of 75 
cents to 80 cents a share after a reduction of 10 cents to 15 cents due to its 
acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. in May. Analysts had expected the company 
to earn about 90 cents a share for the quarter. The Palo Alto-based company, a 
leading manufacturer of computers, earned 80 cents a share in the year-earlier 
period.

SEVERAL AIRLINES TO REDUCE FARES FOR FALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the largest U.S. airlines slashed their round-trip discount fares by as 
much as $160 on Monday to build traffic during the historically weak fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The round of fare cutting was led by Trans World Airlines, which cut its fares 
to 85 U.S. cities and 15 overseas destinations Sunday. On Monday, Northwest 
Airlines, Continental Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines and USAir 
said they would match TWA's domestic reductions. Delta Air Lines said Monday 
that it was studying the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest, Continental and USAir said they would drop their prices only on 
routes where they compete with TWA. But American and United, the nation's two 
largest air carriers, said they would reduce round-trip fares to all U.S. 
destinations except those in Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Change Allowed 
</P>
<P>
The airlines that announced the fare cuts are imposing identical restrictions: 
</P>
<P>
The reduced fares apply to travel between Sept. 9 and Dec. 15, except over the 
Thanksgiving holiday. Tickets must be purchased by Sept. 1, are non-refundable 
and require a Saturday night stay. However, in a change from previous discount 
fare offers, travelers are allowed to change their travel dates once without 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced round-trip fare on Continental Airlines, for example, from New York 
to Los Angeles is $198 on Tuesday and Wednesday and $298 Thursday through 
Monday. That is a reduction from $356 round trip on Tuesday and Wednesday and 
$398 round trip Thursday through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A round of fare cuts aimed at leisure travelers had been expected. "This is not 
unusual to see," said Robert Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines. "With 
summer over and the kids back in school, vacation travel falls off some."

Business inventories rose 0.4% in June as business sales fell 0.3%, the 
government said Monday. Analysts said the report was in line with the economic 
"soft landing" sought by the Federal Reserve Board -- slow but continued growth 
with low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Inventories often rise during slow economic growth as production exceeds 
demand, a process that sometimes leads to a loss of jobs as businesses cut 
their output.

EXPERTS GIVE ADVICE TO PREGNANT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pregnant for the third time, Bobbie Eisenstock follows the same time-tested 
rules. She doesn't drink caffeinated coffee. She only uses over-the-counter 
medicine when absolutely necessary to ease her migraine headaches. "And just 
with my doctor's permission," says the Cal State University Northridge 
professor of journalism and mass communications. 
</P>
<P>
And that includes aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
Low doses of aspirin, two recent studies found, can help prevent complications 
of pregnancy that sometimes necessitate premature delivery: toxemia and high 
blood pressure . 
</P>
<P>
But this advice doesn't apply to most healthy pregnant women, Southern 
California obstetricians say, nor does it warrant self-medication. "Aspirin may 
help prevent (complications), but not every pregnant woman should run out and 
take an aspirin every day," says Dr. Robert Resnik, UC San Diego obstetrician 
and chair of reproductive medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In excess, aspirin can cause dangerous side effects. For instance, Dr. Raul 
Artal, USC professor of obstetrics and gynecology, says that aspirin, taken 
right before delivery, can affect the baby's blood-clotting ability. 
</P>
<P>
So what's the best way for healthy pregnant women to improve the odds of 
delivering a normal baby? Beyond eating a balanced diet, exercising and not 
smoking, here's advice gleaned from a half-dozen recent research studies and 
four respected obstetricians: 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: "Take only Tylenol (acetaminophen) and vitamins without your doctor's 
advice," advises Dr. William A. Frumovitz, an obstetrician-gynecologist at St. 
John's Hospital and Health Center. Don't take any other medicine -- even if 
prescribed by another doctor -- without your obstetrician's clearance, he says. 
Taking medicine doesn't just carry the risk of fetal harm, adds Artal. "It may 
hide a (maternal) symptom of importance." 
</P>
<P>
WEIGHT GAIN: "More is better," suggests a study in this month's Obstetrics 
&amp; Gynecology, particularly for teen-age mothers, first-time mothers, older 
mothers and underweight mothers. Researchers from Hebrew University analyzed 
14,000 births, finding an average weight gain of 23.5 pounds. The more weight 
the mothers gained, the less likely they were to have a low-birth weight infant 
who is more at risk for illness and death. They recommend that underweight 
women put on at least 33 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The average-build woman should gain only about 26-30 pounds," says Dr. 
Reinhold Ullrich, a Torrance obstetrician-gynecologist and past president of 
the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. "And it should be steady throughout the 
pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
STREET DRUGS: Cocaine-addicted babies aren't just an inner-city tragedy, says 
Ullrich. "I've seen them in my Torrance practice too." Even if the mothers only 
take cocaine once early in pregnancy, says USC's Artal, they are at higher risk 
for premature separation of the placenta, sometimes resulting in fetal death. 
</P>
<P>
Government researchers at the Centers for Disease Control found that women who 
use cocaine early in pregnancy increase the risk of serious urinary tract birth 
defects in their infants. They reported their findings in Friday's Journal of 
the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
CAFFEINE: "Caffeine has been variously vilified and vindicated in pregnancy," 
says Frumovitz. "I tell patients not more than one cup a day, and I prefer none 
at all." Resnik disagrees: "I don't know of a shred of evidence that caffeine 
is bad for babies. " Even so, he tells patients to limit coffee to a couple of 
cups a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need to Limit Coffee 
</P>
<P>
Male coffee drinkers, take note. If you have a family history of high blood 
pressure, cut down on caffeine, especially if you're facing a grueling mental 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
That's the advice of a study published in this month's Hypertension journal and 
released today by the American Heart Assn. Researchers compared 17 men, ages 
21-35, considered at risk for hypertension because at least one parent suffered 
from it, with 17 en of the same ages whose parents did not have high blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
After ingesting the equivalent of caffeine found in three cups of coffee and 
performing a difficult motor task, the high-risk men experienced a greater rise 
in cortisol, a stress-related hormone that can contribute to elevated blood 
pressure. About 52% of the high-risk men experienced borderline hypertension, 
defined in this study as 140/90 to 159/95, but only 26% of the low-risk men 
did. A reading of 120/80 is considered normal. 
</P>
<P>
Advising coffee lovers to cut down on caffeine when facing mental challenges 
runs counter to habit, acknowledges Gwen Pincomb, a researcher at the Oklahoma 
City Veterans Administration Medical Center who co-authored the study. 
</P>
<P>
The findings may apply to women as well, she says, admitting she has yet to 
write a research grant proposal without a cup of coffee nearby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Middle-Age Sex Life 
</P>
<P>
Sexual function doesn't decline much in healthy middle-aged men, report 
researchers in the current issue of the journal Sleep. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-night sleep study of 48 healthy men, ages 20-59, those in their 20s 
averaged four or five erections a night, while those in their 50s had three or 
four, termed a "modest difference" by the researchers. Middle-aged men can 
expect to maintain a healthy sex life, conclude University of Pittsburgh 
psychiatrists Charles Reynolds and Michael Thase, if they follow common sense 
health habits. Even though the study was short term and sleep measurements in 
the laboratory don't always reflect true-life situations, USC urologist Dr. 
Jeffry Huffman believes it has important practical implications. "There's a 
clear relationship between alcohol, smoking and erectile dysfunction. Men often 
don't realize the connection." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
X-Ray Interpretation 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you turn an ankle, limp to the hospital and have it X-rayed. The 
emergency room doctor tells you not to worry. He's confident it's not broken. 
What are the odds he's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Low, according to a new study published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine. 
The University of Illinois study looked at how often emergency room doctors, 
who routinely order X-rays, agree with the findings of radiologists who review 
the films later -- and whether the chance of agreement increases if the 
emergency doctor was confident of his X-ray interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency room doctors confident of their X-ray interpretation were usually 
right when it came to X-rays of the chest and extremities. But the rate of 
agreement between emergency room doctors and radiologists wasn't as high on 
X-rays of the skull, spine and abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
The study results mirror clinical experience, believes Dr. Ashok Madahar, 
emergency physician at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan. Spinal X-rays, he 
says, are the most difficult for anyone to interpret; those of the extremities 
the easiest. 
</P>
<P>
"If a patient is told to call back in the morning for an 'official' reading (by 
a radiologist)," says Madahar, "he should be sure to follow up."

ART BUCHWALD: PRICING THE FINAL BRIBE IN SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What on earth is going on in the Soviet Union?" I asked Sochek, my shoe 
repairman. 
</P>
<P>
He replied, "All we are seeing is the expected. Communism doesn't work and it 
never has. In addition, there doesn't seem to be any way for the communist 
leaders to switch to another system without losing their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up hating communists. If they disappear, I am really going to miss 
them," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet people have had it up to here," Sochek said. "Gorbachev knows this 
so he is hoping to change the system without toppling the entire party. One of 
the worst things is the corruption. No matter what is going on, someone always 
has his hand out demanding a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
"Can Gorbachev make a difference to that situation?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but they will print his picture in the newspapers showing him in a crowd, 
promising that he will." 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you leave Russia?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in charge of manufacturing shoes in Minsk. My responsibility was to get 
them made before winter set in. You have to know a lot of people to get shoes 
made in Russia. It was no fun, but I did it. I had only one major problem -- I 
couldn't get any heels for my shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I called the Lenin Rubber Heel Works in Pinsk. They said that they didn't 
have any heels at the moment and told me I should call back in two years." 
</P>
<P>
"How much will you take under the table for the heels you don't have?" I wanted 
to know. "The manager told me, 'Four hundred rubles a heel. If you don't want 
them, the Smolensk Moccasin Cooperative will take all the heels they can get.' 
I paid him under the table for the rubber." 
</P>
<P>
"Where did you get the money to pay him?" 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone in Minsk who wanted a pair of shoes had to pay me under the table." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could complain about that as long as they got their shoes." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the problem," Sochek said. "They didn't get the shoes. Some big shot in 
Moscow ordered that my shoes be sent to his brother-in-law in Kiev." 
</P>
<P>
"For which," I wondered aloud, "he was paid under the table?" 
</P>
<P>
"This is why the system stinks. Even corruption doesn't work in a communist 
country. The bureaucrats are too corrupt to let it work. In a democratic 
society if you bribe somebody, he stays bribed." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you get into a lot of trouble because you couldn't honor your contracts 
for the shoes?" 
</P>
<P>
"The party chief in Minsk attacked me on local television for letting Marx and 
Engels down. He claimed that I was part of the Brezhnev era's do-nothing 
managers, who deserved 20 years of hard labor in Finsk." 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds serious. What did you do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Just what any loyal Soviet citizen would do. I bribed someone in the Ministry 
of Emigration to get me out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet you didn't mind paying that final bribe." 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the last bribe. What makes you think that you can get on a Russian 
airliner for just the price of a ticket?" 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds as if Gorbachev has his work cut out for him. In order to change the 
communist system you have to change the people who are running the country. How 
do you get them out of office?" 
</P>
<P>
Sochek's eyes lit up. "The only way is to bribe somebody else to do it."

PUTTING ON THINKING CAPS OVER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silicon Dreams: Information, Man and Machine by Robert W. Lucky (St. Martin's 
Press: $19.95; 411 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The truth about artificial intelligence is that if you severely and 
artificially restrict a problem, you can get computers to do interesting things 
that look like thought. But if you allow a large area of discourse -- the real 
life situation -- computers don't know what you're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
For example, computers can "understand" a limited vocabulary spoken by speakers 
they have heard before. But they can't make head nor tails of continuous speech 
on any subject by any speaker -- something that you and I do all the time 
without thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, computers have extraordinary skills of their own. They can rattle 
off the Los Angeles telephone directory time after time without a mistake, 
which is far beyond the memory skill of any human. But they cannot distinguish 
one face from another, which even a baby can do. Or a dog. 
</P>
<P>
It comes down to this: Computers are very good at rote tasks that can be 
clearly defined and specified. They are not good at anything requiring 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permanent Limitation? 
</P>
<P>
Whether this is a permanent or a temporary limitation is a matter of dispute 
and, like most disputes, a matter of the temperament of the disputants. 
Optimists argue that in time -- perhaps a long time -- computer "thought" will 
be indistinguishable from human thought. Computers are getting faster and more 
powerful all the time. Sooner or later the goal will be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, realists argue that the "brute force" approach to mimicking 
thought can never be completely successful. You can't reach the moon by 
learning to climb trees. 
</P>
<P>
This subject has been brooded about at length in recent years in popular and 
technical literature. I had thought there wasn't much more to say about it 
until I read "Silicon Dreams" by Robert W. Lucky, a book that links artificial 
intelligence to information theory and in the bargain elucidates both. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky, who is executive director of research at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, has 
written a brilliant exposition of information science, full of fascinating 
details about machines and people and the different ways they know things. He 
also provides the theoretical underpinning for this work and the broad 
philosophical conclusions that can be drawn from it. The book embraces both the 
forest and the trees -- and then some. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work of Genius 
</P>
<P>
Information theory was created in 1948 by Claude Shannon in a paper entitled "A 
Mathematical Theory of Communication." Lucky says flatly of Shannon's paper: "I 
know of no greater work of genius in the annals of technological thought." He 
goes on to explain why this is so and to show how information theory applies to 
the understanding of text and speech and pictures by computers as well as by 
people. 
</P>
<P>
On a broader level, Lucky writes about information itself and of the 
difficulties of dealing with the massive amounts of data and knowledge that the 
world is churning out. "The real task of the information age is the selection 
of which information we take in," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
On a still broader level, he writes about the inherent problem of knowledge: 
How do we know what we know? Is the world knowable, or does it just look that 
way? Are randomness and chance the basic explanatory principles of the 
universe? 
</P>
<P>
"There are two reasons why a probabilistic model of the world is often used in 
physical sciences," Lucky says. "First, it acknowledges our ignorance of the 
true origins of the quantities involved and the minutia of their 
interrelationships. In effect, we say that we do not understand all of these 
details, so we pretend that the outcomes that we see -- for example, the 
symbols that designate messages -- are random. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Powerful Tool' 
</P>
<P>
"The second reason, however, is even more important. Probability theory is a 
powerful tool for analysis. Often when we are unable to calculate even one 
particular special case of known events, we find that we are able to calculate 
the average over many unknown, but random, events. So it was in information 
theory. Shannon's remarkable results are due in large part to the assumption of 
a random model of information generation." 
</P>
<P>
Lucky notes that in the early years of information theory, there was widespread 
belief among its students that it would solve all problems. This initial 
euphoria was followed by a more sober view, which in turn gave way to a "so 
what?" attitude, namely, how does this help us do anything? It's an interesting 
way of looking at the world, but what benefit does it offer? 
</P>
<P>
(One might ask the same question of chaos theory today. It's a cute idea, but 
so what?) 
</P>
<P>
The answer, at least about information theory, is that while it doesn't solve 
the problems, it does make them clearer. Information theory is an elegant 
mathematical and philosophical tool that synthesizes many different ideas and 
provides a way to think about them. Alas, solutions are harder to come by. 
</P>
<P>
That's the good news. The bad news is that "Silicon Dreams" is not an easy 
book. Parts of it are somewhat technical and might profitably have been placed 
in an appendix without harming the text. Even the non-technical parts require 
your undivided attention. Having read it once, I wouldn't want to be tested on 
everything that's in there. 
</P>
<P>
"Silicon Dreams" is not a layman's guide to information theory. But it comes 
close.

An experimental program to bring arts to troubled teen-agers in San Francisco 
has been praised as a success, but there is a problem: money. The California 
Arts Council renewed a $11,000 grant for the project, in which three artists 
work part-time with youths in the city's juvenile jail and with the privately 
run Charila Home for abused girls. However, there is no city money to help 
finance the program. Sponsors are now looking for private funds to match the 
state grant.

INSURANCE CHIEF STEERS TO AVOID BIG RATE HIKES; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING SHOWS HOW PROP. 103 PLANS WOULD AFFECT SAN DIEGO COUNTY MOTORISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie opened five days of hearings on 
Proposition 103-mandated changes in auto insurance pricing methods in San Diego 
on Monday with a pledge to "channel" the law to avoid large rate increases for 
millions of policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's pledge may be good news for policyholders in San Diego, the San 
Joaquin Valley, rural Northern California and the Inland Empire who might 
otherwise under Proposition 103 find themselves subsidizing lower prices in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. But, for policyholders in the urban centers, it 
means there is apt to be little pricing relief. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with deciding just after Labor Day what to do about the existing system 
of basing prices very largely on where a policyholder lives, Gillespie 
indicated that she may direct that the residency factory be applied only on a 
regional or countywide basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Good Than Harm' 
</P>
<P>
"I will try to channel the law to make sure it does more good than harm," the 
insurance commissioner said. 
</P>
<P>
By way of illustrating, Gillespie said that, if there is a flat regional rate 
applied in San Diego and the Inland Empire, the average auto insurance rate 
would rise by 3% in Imperial County and 2% in San Diego County, but decline by 
1% in San Bernardino County and 4% in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
If, by contrast, countywide rates were applied, she said the average rate in 
San Diego County would rise by 14% in La Mesa and 8% in Vista, but go down by 
2% in San Diego and 5% in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing to be held today in Los Angeles, Gillespie may reveal estimates 
for what the possible alternative systems would do in Los Angeles, Orange and 
Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
One thing to bear in mind, however, is that the estimates are based on 
averages. There would be greater fluctuations in individual rates, if either of 
the new systems were applied as a replacement for the present sharp 
neighborhood-by-neighborhood variations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criteria for Rates 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 says that a driver's safety record, miles driven and years of 
driving experience should be used, in that order, as the most important 
criteria for setting rates. But it allows Gillespie to name other factors as 
well, such as place of residence, marital status, sex and age, as long as they 
are shown to have an influence on claims costs. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said Monday that applying this literally by imposing a flat rate 
statewide could result in rate increases in some areas of up to 60%. In only 
three of the state's 58 counties -- Los Angeles, Orange and San Francisco -- 
would rates go down. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as the hearings opened, the positions of the various parties had not 
changed since June, when earlier hearings were held. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry representatives warned that doing away with or subverting 
neighborhood-based pricing would cause enormous price increases for most 
Californians and save money only to those who live in highly populated 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield charged that 
Gillespie is engaged in "fraud" and "propaganda" in warning that implementing 
Proposition 103 could mean large increases for many. He charged that the 
insurance industry is withholding from Gillespie data on what would happen if 
the proposition's rating criteria were used, and he said she should not make up 
her mind what to do until the companies provide the data. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie had a mild response, remarking that she wished Rosenfield and his 
Voter Revolt organization would work with her rather than against her. But she 
did say she would like more pricing data from the companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testimony Predictable 
</P>
<P>
Much of Monday's testimony followed predictable lines. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, insurance agents and insurance company representatives who spoke 
were opposed to anything that might raise rates in their areas in order to 
lower them elsewhere. And San Diegans of all stripes were outraged by the idea 
that, under some scenarios, already apparently rejected by Gillespie, their 
rates would rise so that rates in Los Angeles could go down. 
</P>
<P>
Former San Diego Councilman Bill Cleator voiced the prevailing sentiment when 
he remarked, "L.A. was fouled up because that was the way it was planned." 
</P>
<P>
Besides San Diego and Los Angeles, this week's hearings will also take place in 
Fresno, San Francisco and Eureka. Of those places, Proposition 103 carried only 
in Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the other areas, and 50 of the state's 58 
counties, voters apparently bought the insurance industry campaign argument 
that Proposition 103, applied literally, would do what Gillespie has concluded 
it would do, raise most policyholders' rates. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, a number of insurance agents appeared from north San Diego 
County and Imperial County communities to express fear that alterations in the 
pricing system, no matter what they were, would adversely affect their 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Subsidy 
</P>
<P>
Otis Wood, an agent from Brawley in Imperial County, asked that Imperial not be 
thrown into a single region with San Diego, because, he said, Imperial County 
prices are now well below those in San Diego, and Imperial County policyholders 
should not be made to subsidize those in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Agents from Carlsbad and Vista also saw such dangers to their communities, 
although they said their policyholders would prefer subsidizing fellow San 
Diego County residents, if it came to that, to subsidizing Los Angeles 
residents, if a statewide rate were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Irene, an aide to Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-San Diego), told the 
hearing that "legislators for San Diego County have over the years consistently 
opposed measures promoted by Los Angeles legislators to abolish territorial 
averaging (neighborhood-based pricing)." 
</P>
<P>
"We have always been successful until Proposition 103 was approved," she 
lamented. She called on Gillespie to do everything the commissioner could to 
maintain the old system. 
</P>
<P>
John Mamaux, a Carlsbad city councilman, however, was pleased that Gillespie's 
countywide pricing alternative would reduce average auto insurance rates in his 
city by 2%. 
</P>
<P>
George Tye, a spokesman for the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, the 
Sacramento-based lobbying arm of the industry, said he had helped coordinate 
many of the agent appearances. 
</P>
<P>
The room appeared filled mainly with agents, although one man, Ray Foster, who 
said he represented groups of mobile home owners in the San Diego area, 
testified that he and his followers were increasingly disenchanted with delays 
in implementing parts of Proposition 103 calling for a rate rollback and other 
savings to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Single-County System of Setting Rates 
</P>
<P>
Regional System of Setting Rates 
</P>
<P>
These charts show estimates by Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie on price 
changes that would occur, if she were to adopt either regional or countywide 
pricing systems for auto insurance. Both new systems could not go into effect 
at the same time; Gillespie would have to choose one. And she might adopt 
neither. If she chooses one, it would replace the present system of basing 
rates largely on the neighborhood where a policyholder lives.

MOONLIGHT MANIA; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN LIGHTS DIM, BOWLING BALLS START TO ROLL FOR FUN AND PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 8 p.m., the sun was setting over Spring Valley. The parking lot of the 
Golden Bowl was almost packed. Inside, bowlers by the dozen were lining up for 
the start of Moonlight Bowling. 
</P>
<P>
"Is everybody ready?" boomed the golden-throated emcee on the public-address 
system. "All right then, let's goooooo!" 
</P>
<P>
The lights went out, and the games began. 
</P>
<P>
"You betcha, I'm gonna win me some money tonight!" said Shelly Dahle, 24, who 
handles claims for an automobile insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Money is what Moonlight Bowling is all about. Dahle, who lives in Santee, calls 
it "practical entertainment" for a blue-collar crowd that in 1989 sees 
ballgames, movies and eating out as "luxuries" they can scarcely afford. 
</P>
<P>
The moonlight variety of bowling, which occurs at alleys all over the county 
(indeed, throughout the United States) is enjoying a "vast resurgence," said 
Don Silver, owner of the Golden Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, in Silver's view: A trickle-down economy isn't trickling down to 
the folks who hunt for fun and fellowship on the lanes of the Golden Bowl. 
Silver said California's high cost of living is sending bowlers by the droves 
to his alley on Campo Road, just off California 94. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting too expensive to afford other forms of entertainment," he said. 
"They're becoming the province of the upper classes or at least the 
upper-middle class. Bowling is something a lot of folks can still afford, and, 
after a hard week of work, people need a night out. At least one." 
</P>
<P>
The added incentive is that Moonlight Bowling lets you win money without having 
to spend a week's salary to play. You won't win a lot, Dahle and her teammates 
concede, but it's enough to break even and feel good after "a cheap night out." 
</P>
<P>
The games work this way: After everyone checks in and signs up with a team, the 
lights go off at Silver's command. Only the pins are lit, revealing some as 
red, yellow, blue and gold. Knock down certain pins, and you win cash prizes -- 
$1 here, 25 cents there, maybe $5 if you hit the gold. Other bonuses offer 
men's or women's jackpots. Hit one of those -- such as nailing seven strikes in 
a row, as one bowler did on a recent Saturday night -- and you might win 
several hundred dollars. (The pot was a little down that night, so he won $95.) 
</P>
<P>
The mood was set at the start, after the lights went out. The first set of 
bowlers was asked to roll the ball while lying on the floor. Next, they were 
asked to bowl with their backs turned to the pins. They had to roll the bowling 
ball from between their legs, like a center hiking it to a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Then the serious stuff started, five to a lane. Teams were made up of what 
appeared to be an equal number of men and women. Some were teen-agers, others 
grandmothers on Social Security. At least one was an ex-professional, and 
plenty were couples who smuggled in infants who dozed in car seats as the balls 
crashed the pins and loud adult voices whooped and hollered at every mild 
victory.

Karrlyn Van Vooren, 46, is a secretary at an El Cajon body shop. She shows up 
every week for Moonlight Bowling. She says it's too expensive to go to movies 
anymore, and she's referring to the outdoor kind. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get into a drive-in with a carload of kids for less than $15," she 
said. "So it's cheaper to stay home and watch the VCR. But gosh, you get tired 
of that. So, we go Moonlight Bowling." 
</P>
<P>
Suzan White, 32, who showed up with her 2-month-old son, admitted that "the 
gambling aspect" is what draws her to the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"I come every Saturday night, without fail," she said. "You try to make back as 
much as you spend, but for me, even that's a thrill. With expenses the way they 
are, it's a free night out. You can't beat that. Last week, I came out $13 in 
the black. And I got to tell you, it's something I look forward to all week 
long. It's one of the few things I can take the baby to." 
</P>
<P>
White also engages in Moonlight Bowling at Frontier Lanes in Loma Portal. 
Frontier is the county's only 24-hour bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brown, 25, an accounting clerk who lives in Spring Valley, said some of 
the alleys that serve as hosts for Moonlight Bowling offer Gold Bond or Blue 
Chip stamps instead of cash. 
</P>
<P>
"We hate that," she said. "It's such a hassle, having to fill up those books 
with stamps and mail away for prizes. Here, you come and you get your money 
right away. It's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Moonlight Bowling has reached other corners of the country. David 
Kirkland, 21, who was at Golden Bowl on Saturday night, said he's a regular in 
his hometown of Ft. Worth, Tex. He was visiting friends and picking up what he 
called "spare change . . . literally." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Popular Trend 
</P>
<P>
Silver, the proprietor, said Moonlight Bowling has come back into vogue largely 
because of operators giving up the stamp concept in exchange for cash. He sees 
bowling as a trend not just among the blue-collar crowd but among yuppies as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
He believes his alley is popular, partly because it's one of the few 
mom-and-pop operations left in the county -- most bowling centers are run by 
chains -- and partly because it's the only one left that has manual scoring. 
All others have resorted to computerized score-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Fitzsimonds, 48, is a sales representative for an electronics firm, a 
Spring Valley resident and a faithful attendee of Moonlight Bowling. 
Fitzsimonds also is an ex-professional whose average hovers between 208 and 
225. He and partner Ken Racette bowl in competitive leagues in which the prizes 
go as high as $5,000. He likes Moonlight Bowling for its "low-brow ambiance" 
and zany moments, which he said the "hard-core" leagues sadly lack. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, one of the reasons I think this thing is so popular is the 
aspect of turning the lights out," he said. "A lot of people are shy about a 
lot of things, bowling being no exception. By turning the lights out, it seems 
to loosen folks up and do away with shyness. People hit a spare or strike, win 
a quarter or two, and all of a sudden, they're into it." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Olson, 71, is a "moonlight junkie" who finds an alley every Saturday 
where she can feed her addiction. She took several friends with her to Spring 
Valley on Saturday night. She won $20 recently at a Moonlight Bowling event in 
Las Vegas and was still talking about it at Golden Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a champ," she said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
Dahle, the auto-insurance worker, who hears "a lot of bitter voices" during the 
week, said Moonlight Bowling is of deeper sociological relevance than mere fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We need low-cost, tension-reducing forms of recreation," she said, "and we 
don't have many anymore. Everything is getting so outrageously expensive. 
Sometimes, I think there's going to be a revolution in America -- everybody 
seems so unhappy, so angry. There's a lot of frustration. But, with Moonlight 
Bowling, you come out, you win a little money -- or not lose too much -- and 
you go home happy. And nowadays, that's worth a lot."

MERGER STUDY MAY DELAY NEW LINE, EDISON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Edison executives fear that the state's slow-moving review 
of its proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric will stall 
construction of a planned electric-transmission line that would give its 
customers easier access to electricity produced by nuclear and coal-fired power 
plants in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, in recent filings with the state Public Utilities Commission, said that 
failure to begin construction of the line by mid-1990 will have a "significant" 
impact on its existing customers -- and SDG&amp;E's customers, if the proposed 
utility merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Transmission lines play an important role for publicly owned utilities in 
Southern California that increasingly are becoming dependent on power produced 
by out-of-state utilities. Edison has been reluctant to share space on its 
lines, and municipal utilities have been in court for nearly two decades 
seeking improved access to the Rosemead-based utility's massive web of 
transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's failure to begin construction of the line between the Palo Verde 
nuclear plant in Arizona and an Edison substation called Devers to the east of 
Los Angeles will not have an immediate impact on SDG&amp;E's electric rates, 
said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
San Diego-based consumer group opposed to the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposed Palo Verde-Devers line "does have an impact on the economics 
of the proposed merger," Shames said Monday. "Some of the (merger) benefits 
predicted by Edison are premised on the building of that line. So a delay could 
change the mathematics of the merger." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC has ordered Edison to "consider the future with the Devers-Palo Verde 
line in, and out, of its cost analysis," PUC spokesman spokesman Phil Weismehl 
said Monday. "In effect, as we go through the merger review, we've asked that 
their evaluations include assumptions that it is or isn't going to be built." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Utilities Concerned 
</P>
<P>
And the possibility that Edison won't begin construction next summer has caused 
concern as well among executives at municipal electric utilities in Southern 
California who already are planning where to buy power during the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in limbo," said Art Devine, executive director of the Southern 
California Public Power Authority, a Glendale-based group that represents 
several municipally operated electric utilities including those in Los Angeles, 
Anaheim and Riverside. "Our feeling is that we'd like the line to be built as 
soon as possible . . . because it would improve (transmission) and 
reliability." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E, which already owns the Southwest Powerlink, a 500-megawatt line 
stretching between San Diego and Arizona, would not own any of the proposed 
line. Edison would own 63.2%, the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power 
would own 30.7%, and a consortium of other publicly owned utilities in Southern 
California would own the rest. 
</P>
<P>
While the PUC last year granted Edison a "certificate of need" to build the 
line, commissioners were uncertain how the merger would affect the need for an 
expensive new transmission line so they agreed to review that certificate if 
the merger was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Edison has argued that the line makes economic sense with or without the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accord Necessary 
</P>
<P>
Edison still hopes to build the line, but to do so it must reach an agreement 
with the the LADWP. Prior to announcing its intended merger with SDG&amp;E, 
Edison had signed an agreement with the LADWP, Southern California's largest 
municipally owned utility, that called for construction to begin by June of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after announcing the proposed merger with SDG&amp;E, Edison 
renegotiated that agreement to include a June, 1990, construction start-up 
date. At the time, that date seemed fairly safe to Edison management, which 
expected the PUC to quickly complete the merger review. 
</P>
<P>
But the PUC now is considering a plan that would link review of the 
transmission line to the already complex merger review, a move that would push 
Edison beyond next June's construction start-up deadline.

WITNESS AT SITE OF CLAIREMONT SLAYINGS SURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors said Monday that they have a witness who saw Christopher Clark Box 
at the scene of a triple slaying last week in Clairemont at about the time the 
killings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Box, 20, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he killed a young woman, her 
3-year-old child, and a young man in a Clairemont house. The bodies of the 
victims, who apparently were beaten, were found at different locations, but 
investigators believe they were killed at the house on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Rodney Nicholson, suffered a broken arm when Box hit him with a 
baseball bat at the house, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Lori Rooney. Box 
also has been charged with the attempted murder of Nicholson. "He's one of the 
witnesses who can identify him," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the survivor was disclosed Monday at Box's arraignment in a 
courtroom packed with his high-school friends. Box was a star wrestler and 
football player at Clairemont High School. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said Nicholson did not witness the slayings of April Gilhousen, 20; her 
son, Bryan, and Kevin Chandler, 29. Gilhousen's body was found in the house. 
Her 4-month-old daughter, Aspen, was found in her crib nearby, unhurt. The 
bodies of the other two victims were found in the Clairemont neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson knocked on Gilhousen's door and was assaulted by Box, Rooney said. 
Nicholson then ran to a convenience store and was treated for his injuries, she 
said. He apparently was unaware of what happened in the house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old co-defendant, a member of the Clairemont High School football 
team, is to have a detention hearing today in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said robbery was "most likely" a motive for the slayings, adding that 
she had no information about why the bodies were taken from the house. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Frank Brown set bail for Box at $2 million and set a 
preliminary hearing for Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The muscular Box came into the courtroom wearing jail clothes, looked at the 
crowd and faced the judge, all the time surrounded by three or four bailiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Box's father was in the audience, but he declined to talk to reporters.

PANAMA BANK GETS FINE OF $5 MILLION IN COCAINE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Panamanian bank has pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges in a major 
case involving drug proceeds for Colombia's Medellin cartel and has been 
ordered to pay a record $5-million penalty, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The pleas stemmed from a massive investigation code-named Polar Cap, which also 
led to indictments in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and New York. Trials in the 
Los Angeles case are scheduled for January, 1990, and May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley in Atlanta sentenced Banco de Occidente 
of Panama to forfeit $5 million to the United States after accepting the bank's 
guilty plea. "This sentence not only is the largest sentence ever imposed by a 
federal court against a bank for drug money laundering, but also marks the 
greatest single forfeiture of substitute assets to the U.S.," said Robert L. 
Barr Jr., U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Barr said the judge's action was based on provisions of the 1986 Anti-Drug 
Abuse Act, which provides that defendants may be ordered to forfeit 
"substitute" property if the actual drug proceeds cannot be seized. In this 
case, Barr said, the government's investigation found that the drug money had 
been removed from the United States after it passed through the bank in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"The ability of the government to seize the bank's assets unquestionably 
brought the bank to the negotiating table," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement called for the government to dismiss its case against Banco 
de Occidente's (Panama) parent bank, Banco de Occidente (S.A.), headquartered 
in Cali, Colombia. Barr said the Colombian bank has guaranteed the United 
States the full payment of the Panamanian bank's forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Investigation Ever 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution of the banks was part of the Polar Cap probe, which was the largest 
narcotic money-laundering investigation ever by U.S. law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
On March 8, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles announced that a grand jury here 
indicted 33 wholesale jewelers and associates in the downtown jewelry district 
on charges of running a $1-billion cocaine money-laundering ring. Prosecutors 
said they also had filed civil complaints aimed at seizing $80 million in 
property owned by the defendants, including a 10-story building in the heart of 
the jewelry district. 
</P>
<P>
Mark J. Werksman, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who is one of the 
prosecutors in the jewelry mart cases, said Monday's guilty pleas in Atlanta 
will have a positive effect on the Los Angeles cases but declined to elaborate. 
A federal prosecutor in Atlanta said he did not know if any Banco Occidente 
officials would testify in the Los Angeles cases but said evidence gathered in 
the case might be used here. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanley I. Greenberg, a lawyer for one of the major defendants in the cases 
here, said that Banco Occidente was not a defendant in Los Angeles and had not 
been mentioned in any papers he had seen in the case.

INMATE WHO ESCAPED FROM EL CAJON JAIL IS CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A burglary suspect who escaped from the County Jail in El Cajon last month by 
climbing out a hole in the building's wall and descending on a rope made from 
sheets was captured Monday. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Pugh, 36, was caught by San Diego police about 11:20 a.m. after a 
civilian reported seeing him in an alley near 29th Street and Imperial Avenue, 
a San Diego County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Pugh, of the 3600 block of Oceanview Boulevard, was being held without bail in 
County Jail downtown on suspicion of escape, in addition to the previous 
charges of burglary and possession of stolen property, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon jail deputies, on the morning of July 18, discovered a large hole on 
the seventh floor of the nine-story building, with a 120-foot rope made of bed 
sheets dangling out of it. 
</P>
<P>
After a check of prisoners, deputies realized that Pugh had escaped by climbing 
through a small ceiling vent and kicking a hole in the building's exterior 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
Pugh was the first man to escape the jail, built in 1983.

Construction resumed Monday at the San Diego Convention Center after a 
settlement was reached with striking union workers. 
</P>
<P>
The center's labor force returned to work and halted a 2 1/2-day walkout, said 
Billy Crockett, the center's construction manager. Union laborers left their 
jobs last Wednesday in protest over the employment of nonunion workers by a 
subcontractor, Crockett said. 
</P>
<P>
The nonunion laborers were hired to install resin flooring in the kitchens. A 
union contract stipulated that subcontractors could only use union workers. The 
issue was resolved when the nonunion workers agreed Friday afternoon to join 
the union, at least until the project's completion, scheduled for Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The immediate problem is put to bed," Crockett said, adding that he was unsure 
whether the work stoppage would affect the completion deadline. The contractor, 
Tutor-Saliba-Perini, already faces the problem of repairing a faulty sprinkler 
system because it failed a Fire Department inspection.

AGING PIPES MADE SEWAGE SPILL WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deteriorating sewer pipes, a large blockage and a shortage of repair parts 
caused leaks that spilled about 800,000 gallons of raw effluent into Arroyo 
Conejo Creek in Thousand Oaks over the weekend, city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-mile stretch of the creek from Thousand Oaks to its terminus at Point Mugu 
has been posted as unsafe for swimming by Ventura County health officials. The 
ban is expected to last about five days until the bacterial concentration is 
diluted by creek waters, said Elizabeth Huff, a county environmental health 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the spill, which occurred in municipally owned open space, 
did not pose a public health risk. The nearest housing is about a quarter of a 
mile away. 
</P>
<P>
About four dozen fish have died so far as a result of the spill. Damage to 
wildlife is not expected to be significant because the discharge occurred 
downstream of deep pools where green perch, arroyo chubs and catfish breed, 
said Greg Smith, the city's environmental planner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leak Started Saturday 
</P>
<P>
The sewage -- in volume the equivalent of about 160,000 toilet flushes -- began 
leaking Saturday afternoon from the first of two breaks in an aging eight-inch 
steel pipeline in the northwest corner of the city, said Kurt O. Reithmayr, 
principal engineer with the city Utilities Department. 
</P>
<P>
Problems began when an obstruction in a 30-inch pipe nearby built up pressure 
and cracked the smaller line, Reithmayr said. The cracked pipeline is 25 years 
old and was scheduled for replacement this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The leak was spotted Saturday afternoon by a security guard patrolling the 
adjacent MGM Ranch property, Reithmayr said. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the pressure, city crews opened the smaller line Saturday but 
couldn't recap it because they did not have a large enough plug and could not 
get one from nearby agencies, Reithmayr said. As a result, thousands of gallons 
of additional sewage leaked from the line before it was sealed Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like you have a hose and you're trying to make the darn thing stop 
gushing, but you can't," Reithmayr said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd Leak 
</P>
<P>
A second leak sprang open in the line Sunday a short distance from the first. 
Both breaks were clamped and sewage stopped leaking into the creek Sunday. City 
crews also opened a bypass pipeline to reduce the pressure, Reithmayr said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were still working Monday evening to remove the blockage in the larger 
line, which Reithmayr said could be rocks, wood or even a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
The larger line flows west through Wildwood Canyon to Hill Canyon Wastewater 
Treatment Plant north of Newbury Park. The smaller line flows north from the 
Ventura Freeway through Arroyo Conejo Canyon to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The state Regional Water Quality Control Board will investigate the spill and 
could levy fines if it finds the city was negligent, said David Gildersleebe, a 
supervising engineer for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The city discharges about 10.5 million gallons of treated waste water daily 
into Arroyo Conejo Creek. In 1978 and in 1981, flooding from winter storms 
resulted in minor spills of untreated sewage into the creek, city official 
said.

<P>
An infatuated fan who wrote letters and sent gifts to news anchor Kelly Lange 
for five years was arrested for allegedly threatening to shoot the KNBC-TV 
newswoman, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Sevy Hudson, who allegedly told a co-worker that he was "bored with life 
and that he was going to Burbank to shoot Kelly Lange," was charged with making 
a terrorist threat on the Channel 4 anchorwoman. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said that for five years, 
Hudson, 57, had been writing letters, making phone calls and sending gifts to 
Lange, which were returned. 
</P>
<P>
A KNBC executive contacted the district attorney's office Thursday and said he 
had been notified of the threat, which was allegedly made Wednesday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Job 
</P>
<P>
Police launched an investigation, interviewed the co-worker and found out that 
Hudson had been fired Thursday from his job as a laborer at a gold bullion 
exchange.

Hudson was arrested Friday at a motel where he lived. Police said they 
recovered a .38-caliber Colt revolver and ammunition when they arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson was scheduled to be arraigned today. The district attorney's office said 
it would ask for $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Lange and KNBC had no comment on the arrest, station spokeswoman Regina 
Miyamoto said. 
</P>

"This is in the hands of the police, the district attorney and the courts," 
Miyamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent spate of threats and acts of violence against celebrities have 
produced concern and even legislation on the issue of celebrity safety. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a state parole board delayed for at least nine months the release of 
Arthur Jackson, convicted of a nearly fatal knife attack on actress Theresa 
Saldana in 1982. From prison, Jackson wrote letters threatening Saldana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspired Law 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's eligibility for parole after serving seven years of a 12-year prison 
sentence has been assailed by Saldana. It inspired a new state law to keep 
violent, mentally ill prisoners in mental hospitals after they complete their 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
In July, police arrested a Canadian woman who loitered around NBC-TV studios in 
Burbank for several days and refused orders to leave, as fans lined up to see 
"The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson." Guards found an 11-inch knife in her 
backpack. 
</P>
<P>
On July 18, Robert John Bardo, 19, is alleged to have shot actress Rebecca 
Schaeffer to death at the door of her Los Angeles apartment. Bardo has been 
described as an "obsessed fan" of the 21-year-old actress.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A burglary at a National City credit union office has led police to a stolen 
property ring that hid more than $200,000 in purloined office equipment, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The break-in occurred at 2 p.m. Sunday at the National City Municipal Employee 
Credit Union in the 2100 block of Hoover Avenue, according to National City 
Police Officer David Grande. Police arrested George Cottingham, 42, of the 800 
block of North 41st Street, San Diego, at the scene, Grande said. 
</P>
<P>
Cottingham was being held Monday at County Jail downtown on violation of parole 
and suspicion of five counts of burglary. He will be arraigned today in Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Police also arrested an El Cajon used-car salesman in connection with the case. 
Leon Famera, 56, of the 2200 block of Wind River Road, was described by Grande 
as the alleged fence in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Famera was being held Monday at County Jail on suspicion of 20 counts of 
possession of stolen property and two counts of possession of drugs for sale. 
His bail was set at $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, San Diego police arrested a third man, 71-year-old Allen Mitchell of 
the 400 block of Richey Road as a result of the investigation, said San Diego 
police spokesman David Cohen. Mitchell's house contained "an amazing amount" of 
office equipment in addition to guns and ammunition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also was being held in County Jail on suspicion of 20 counts of 
possession of stolen property, police said. His bail was $40,000.

29-YEAR-OLD TOPPER THE GIRAFFE PUT TO SLEEP; AT ZOO SINCE 1962 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Topper, a 29-year-old Uganda giraffe, died Monday at the San Diego Zoo when his 
chronic foot problems prompted veterinarians to put him to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Topper leaves Checkers, one of his two longtime mates, as the only 
Uganda giraffe at the zoo, although three Masai giraffes -- a different 
subspecies -- live in an adjoining enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Topper was brought to San Diego at the age of 2 in mid-October, 1962, after 
being caught in Kenya. With Checkers and another mate, Freckles, who died in 
1984, the 18-foot-tall giraffe sired 21 children, many of whom have populated 
zoos throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
His son Blackjack was for years the Wild Animal Park's breeding male giraffe. 
He died in 1987 at the age of 17. 
</P>
<P>
Topper, who suffered from painful foot problems, on Monday afternoon was 
visited by several of his longtime keepers. He then was led into the giraffe 
barn, where veterinarians injected him with a lethal dose of a sedative. The 
giraffe collapsed onto hay bales, put in place to cushion his fall. 
</P>
<P>
Topper will be cremated at the zoo after an autopsy. LORI GRANGE

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRAFFIC REROUTED AFTER GAS LINE RUPTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-inch natural gas line near a busy Arleta intersection was ruptured Monday 
by a Southern California Gas Co. crew, causing traffic to be temporarily 
rerouted, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The break occurred about 9 a.m. while workers were repairing the line at San 
Fernando Road and Branford Street, said gas company spokeswoman Sharon Bryant. 
Workers were able to shut valves to the gas line in about 30 minutes, Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several firefighters were sent to the scene as a safety measure, but there were 
no injuries or evacuations, said Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.

NEW MEN AT TOP INJECT ENTHUSIASM INTO THE COWBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be that Tom Landry would stand off about 20 yards from his players 
and coaches, and silently watch drills in the Dallas Cowboys' training camp, 
his hawk eyes staring stonily out from under the bill of a baseball cap, 
betraying nothing. 
</P>
<P>
That was the Landry style: motivation through insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson smiles. He jokes with his players during stretching exercises. He 
struts in his busy fashion from group to group, shouting encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Johnson and new Cowboys owner Jerry Jones have given some people in 
the organization plenty of reason to feel insecure. But aside from the 
unceremonious way in which they canned Landry, club president Tex Schramm and 
player personnel director Gil Brandt, Johnson and Jones have injected some 
fresh air into a franchise that had gone stale. 
</P>
<P>
"Landry and Jimmy Johnson are like night and day," 14-year center Tom Rafferty 
said recently. "Jimmy talks to you. He gives you positive reinforcement and 
enthusiasm. He jokes around, and the players love it. Tom wasn't like that. 
Jimmy has a more outgoing personality, and that's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie quarterback Steve Walsh, who played under Johnson in college at Miami, 
calls him "The Great Psychologist" for the way he concentrates on keeping his 
players in the right frame of mind to win while leaving the technique-oriented 
coaching to assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging his reputation as a motivator, Johnson said, "It doesn't make a 
difference how old you are, you still need to be motivated. I want them to work 
hard, but I also want them to enjoy it. I want it to be a somewhat relaxed 
atmosphere, but they should have a sense of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Johnson has succeeded in walking that fine line. He has instilled some 
optimism in a young team and has rewarded his players for their hard work by 
relaxing curfew and allowing them to practice in shorts instead of pads more 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
That there has been any change is the biggest change from the Landry regime. "I 
didn't feel Coach Landry ever changed over all the time I was here," Rafferty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One trademark was the way offensive linemen got into the set position at the 
line of scrimmage and stood up before getting set again. But Landry was most 
inflexible when it came to the "Flex" defense. If he lost touch with the game, 
it was in his persistence in using the "Flex." Johnson primarily is a defensive 
coach, and he has installed a modern system that comes as a relief to many of 
the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to play more zone coverage and we can be more aggressive," said 
ninth-year cornerback Everson Walls. "It gives you a sense of security at 
cornerback as opposed to the 'Flex,' where we always were in man-to-man 
coverage. I pride myself on my man coverage, but you don't want to be 
predictable. In this defense, no one is left hung out to dry. Coach Landry 
refused to change the 'Flex.' We complained to the assistant coaches, but they 
always said, 'Coach Landry wants it this way.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're finally getting to the point where we're like other NFL defenses. 
You can remain aggressive because you've got penetration by the defensive line 
and a matchup zone in the secondary so no receivers can run free deep." 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Cowboys won the NFC East was in 1985. They were 6-2 in 1986 
when quarterback Danny White suffered a wrist injury that ended his 
effectiveness as a starter. Rafferty traced the Cowboys' demise to that point. 
"We were never the same team after Danny broke his wrist," Rafferty said. "You 
can read into that what you want." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Pelluer, White's replacement, was not the answer. Johnson 
quickly reached the same conclusion after taking over the team and choosing 
UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman with the No. 1 pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Pelluer went into a terminal pout after Aikman signed a six-year contract worth 
slightly more than $11 million. Now, Pelluer is a free agent and a trade seems 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
It seems clear Aikman is destined to start and that Walsh, the first pick in 
the supplemental draft, will back him up. But the prospect of going with two 
rookie quarterbacks doesn't bother Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"We know they both are talented," he said. "It's a matter of making sure they 
have a good supporting cast. I'd love to have a veteran with Aikman's or 
Walsh's talent, but I don't." 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line hasn't overpowered anyone lately, but Johnson insisted they 
have a blocking system capable of protecting his rookie quarterbacks. As long 
as Aikman is in the game, that means plenty of sprint-out pass plays. 
</P>
<P>
"The rollouts will help because I can move, and it gives the offensive linemen 
a break," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
David Shula was hired off his father's Miami Dolphins staff to coordinate the 
offense, and Aikman is comfortable because he is required to read defenses in 
much the same way he did at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded of the beating John Elway took as a starter for most of his rookie 
year with Denver, Aikman said, "There are going to be a lot of shaky times. I'm 
not naive enough to think I can take the league by storm. I want to keep my 
head up and be consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the ideal situation, you'd like to learn from a veteran, but that's not 
the situation here. Everybody keeps asking about the pressure I'm supposed to 
feel, but I don't feel it. As a quarterback, I've lived with it all my life." 
</P>
<P>
If Landry still were coach, the pressure on Aikman to produce immediate results 
probably would be greater, but in this situation, there are rookies from the 
owner on down to share the burden.

COACH TIRES OF QUARTERBACK TALK

Al Saunders heard the question over and over last year as Chargers coach. Dan 
Henning, his successor, already is hearing it more than he would like this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
People ask: What about the Charger quarterbacks? No coach has really had an 
answer since Dan Fouts decided it was safer sitting in the broadcast booth than 
standing a few feet in front of defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's exhibition loss to Dallas didn't make this year's situation any 
clearer. Rookie Billy Joe Tolliver completed three of five passes for a grand 
total of 11 yards. David Archer, who played for Henning in Atlanta, completed 
13 of 26 for 143 yards. Mark Malone was four of 11 for 51 yards. Both Archer 
and Malone were intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Henning said he thought reporters were more concerned about the 
quarterback situation than he was. Asked if the Chargers should shop for 
another quarterback, he said: "I've addressed that question enough." 
</P>
<P>
He addressed it again Monday before practice at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had expressed a desire to look for another quarterback, he said: 
"What I express and what I don't express to the personnel department will not 
be discussed in this forum ever." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said only two of the three quarterbacks who played Sunday will play 
Saturday in Chicago against the Bears, but he hasn't decided who will sit out. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time," he said, "I'm going to sit here and wait on it." 
</P>
<P>
He'll also have to wait on Mark Vlasic, his fourth quarterback. The Chargers 
won both games Vlasic started last season, but he injured his knee in the third 
quarter of his second start, an eventual 38-24 victory over the Rams, and 
missed the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, trainers cleared Vlasic to practice when he feels comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"Vlasic's situation is status quo," Henning said. "If we do put him out in the 
mix and he's not ready, then he's done. The possibility that he's not ready 
still exists." 
</P>
<P>
Unless there is "an extraordinary situation," Henning said roster cuts will not 
be made until after the Chargers travel to San Francisco to play the 49ers Aug. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, Charger director of football operations, met Monday with 
holdout defensive end Joe Phillips, but doesn't know when he expects Phillips 
to agree to terms. Ortmayer said there have been no new negotiations with 
running back Gary Anderson or rookie defensive end Burt Grossman, the Chargers' 
first draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Andy Parker, a free agent formerly of San Dieguito High School who 
played with the Raiders the past five seasons, sustained a slight ligament tear 
in his knee during the first quarter Sunday. He will miss this week's practices 
and may undergo arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon McCallum, acquired from the Raiders in last year's Jim Lachey trade, 
made a brief appearance Sunday and, according to Henning, was supposed to play 
more. Problem was, he was slated to take the field on first-down situations in 
the second half. Because the Chargers were behind, Henning said first downs had 
to be played like third downs for catchup purposes. So McCallum finished with 
only one reception for two yards and no carries.

ENCINO BEATS RIALTO FOR PONY TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encino earned its first trip to the Pony League World Series with an 11-5 
thumping of Rialto in the championship game of the U. S. West Zone Pony League 
championship Monday night in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Encino used the strong relief pitching of Chris Ferebee, who picked up the win, 
to shut down an early Rialto threat, and then rallied in the fourth inning to 
put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Encino will open World Series play Friday against host Washington, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Encino took a 3-0 lead in the top of the first inning on a bases-loaded walk to 
Justin Paperny, an run-scoring single by Jesus Perez and a steal of home by 
Kevin Deitch. 
</P>
<P>
Rialto scored a run in the bottom of the inning, however, and had the bases 
loaded with just one out when Ferebee relieved starter Matt Ward. Ferebee 
struck out the next batter and then got a ground ball to second to kill the 
threat.

U.S. LIKES FRENCH TOUCH IN HIGH TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mention France and Americans usually envision fine wines, stylish fashions and 
gourmet meals. But it's high technology, not haute cuisine, that dominates the 
French-American connection. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, French industries are coming on strong, especially in 
aerospace, communications and transportation. Americans ride in French trains, 
airplanes and subway cars; launch their satellites with French rockets, and do 
a host of chores with French-inspired computer wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
"Aircraft and aircraft engines and systems bring the most dollars back to 
France," says Daniel Gagneux, a commercial counselor at the French Embassy in 
Washington. "More than $2 billion worth were sold in the United States last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
That trend is likely to continue as American carriers welcome new generations 
of Airbuses that feature "fly-by-wire" systems designed largely by the French. 
Replacing standard mechanical links, fly-by-wire gives pilots a handy side 
stick instead of a wheel. Control of the plane flows from the stick through 
wires to five computers that control crucial components in the wings and tail. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie, the consortium of French and other European manufacturers 
that planned the new 150-passenger jetliners, already has sold 191 of them in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Launches Satellites 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters and smaller French-manufactured aircraft are also flying American 
skies. The U.S. Coast Guard operates the largest fleet: 96 French helicopters 
and 41 small French jet planes. 
</P>
<P>
The French influence extends far above U.S. airspace. Managed by France and 
supported by a consortium of European governments, Arianespace regularly 
launches commercial satellites from a site in French Guiana. Since 1984, 
Arianespace has put 14 U.S. telecommunications satellites in orbit, and two or 
three more will be lofted this year. 
</P>
<P>
Few satellites launched by Arianespace have had more impact than SPOT, a 
spacecraft that beams back high-resolution images of Earth from space. Owned 
and operated by France's space agency, SPOT can produce clear images of an area 
measuring only 10 meters -- about half the size of a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers in the United States range from farmers and government agencies to 
urban planners," Pierre Bescond, president of Spot Image Corp., told National 
Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
American urban planners also are turning to French people-movers to alleviate 
some of their problems. 
</P>
<P>
At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, an elevated, dual-track French rail 
system will link four major terminals with remote parking lots. The 
computer-controlled, driverless robot trains, scheduled to begin operation next 
year, initially will carry as many as 2,400 passengers an hour at speeds of up 
to 50 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation in other cities, including Atlanta and New York, gets a boost 
from French-manufactured subway cars. 
</P>
<P>
But it is on intercity rail runs that French technology soon may be making its 
biggest impact in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Speed Trains 
</P>
<P>
Reaching speeds of 110 m.p.h., French turboliner trains, powered by motors 
adapted from helicopter engines, have cut travel time between New York and 
Albany from three hours to two hours and eight minutes. A new version of the 
trains, proposed between New York and Boston at speeds of up to 125 m.p.h., 
would make the trip in three hours, cutting 45 minutes off existing travel 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) -- train of great speed -- would carry 
passengers even faster if approved for Florida service between Miami, Ft. 
Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa. Flashing through the Florida 
countryside at speeds sometimes reaching 185 m.p.h., the new-generation TGV 
would be operated by a lone driver in the cab and controlled by a system of 
computers in each car. 
</P>
<P>
The Gallic touch in computers revolutionized videotex, a method of sending and 
receiving text and graphics, usually over telephone lines, between a central 
computer and a terminal or personal computer. Known as Minitel in France, the 
system consists of a keyboard, a screen and a modem, an instrument that 
translates telephone signals into computer-readable graphics. 
</P>
<P>
In France, 4.4 million subscribers can use Minitel to bank, shop and read their 
morning newspapers. Some even use the system as a kind of lonely-hearts 
service, tapping out messages to one another's pseudonyms. 
</P>
<P>
"These chat services are very popular in the United States, too," says Terry 
Ribb, marketing director for Minitel Services of Purchase, N.Y., which is 
marketing French Minitel technology in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Houston is one of the hottest current markets for the American version of 
Minitel. Systems have been distributed to almost 10,000 households -- the 
eventual target is 60,000 -- in a mass-market test financed by two U.S. 
companies, Videotel and Southwestern Bell Telephone.

Chock Full O'Nuts Corp. said it has signed a letter of intent to acquire the 
Tenco private-label instant coffee business of Tetley Inc. for about $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Tenco processes instant coffee and markets it to major supermarket chains for 
private-label sales. Revenue from its coffee business totaled $22 million in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chock said it would sign a long-term lease on Tenco's instant coffee plant in 
Linden, N.J., as part of the deal.

U.S. SPENDING PATTERNS ARE MAKING CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY CITES CLOUT OF AGING BABY BOOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A drastic shift in spending patterns is under way as America's baby boomers 
enter middle age and their wallets grow fatter. 
</P>
<P>
The finding that emerged from a study commissioned by Prevention magazine that 
nearly 47% of American adults will fall into the 35-to-59-year age group by the 
turn of the century is no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
But the study, prepared for Prevention by the National Planning Data Corp. 
based on U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics, also revealed that middle-aged 
Americans will be the spending leaders -- by sometimes surprisingly large 
margins -- in virtually every category examined. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and the year 2000, the income and expenditures of middle-aged 
Americans are projected to outpace the rate of increase in the group's size. In 
effect, middle-aged consumers will have spending sway over 60% of all income, 
the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as this group inevitably redirects the ways in which it spends, 
businesses will be required "to reassess their selling strategies," the study 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
"A direct result of the advancing age of the population means that consumers 
have different interests, priorities and outlooks on life," said Kurt Barnard, 
publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report in New York. "We'll see these 
people much more willing to spend, say, $1,000 for new drapes than for several 
new dresses." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the years 1988-1993, the Prevention study said projected spending 
increases by the middle-aged will grow between 17% and 28% for the six-year 
period in such important categories as food, personal-care products and 
footwear. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, purchases of food for the household by the 35-to-59 age group 
will grow 17.3% to $115.7 billion, compared to a projected decline in such 
purchases for those aged 18 to 34 and a small increase for those 60 or over. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged consumers are expected to be the biggest spenders at restaurants, 
too. A 27.8% increase in expenditures to $76 billion is anticipated from the 
group in the 1988-1993 period, far outpacing both younger and older 
counterparts.

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES

<TEXT>
<P>
* Noting costs associated with a recent proxy fight and reserves resulting from 
a reevaluation of its assets, Oak Industries reported a $7.1-million loss on 
$50.6-million revenue for its second quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, which contrasts with a profit of $539,000 on revenue of $48.5 million 
for the same quarter last year, reflects a $2-million proxy expense, $945,000 
in corporate reorganization expense, including employee severance costs, and $2 
million for the reevaluation and required reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Oak also booked a $1.5-million expense from the operation and liquidation of 
the company's discontinued telephone advertising business. Oak's current 
management wrested control of the company in June after a victorious proxy 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended June 30, Oak's loss stands at $7.6 million on sales of 
$101.3 million, contrasted with a profit of $3.9 million on sales of $99.5 
million for the same period last year.

TRADE SCHOOL TRYING TO REBUILD IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
UNITED EDUCATION HOPES NEW MANAGEMENT WILL LEAD FIRM OUT OF MORASS OF PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask Aaron Cohen, the president of United Education &amp; Software, about the 
trade school business and he'll tell you about social responsibility. He'll 
expound on the need to give the inner-city kid on welfare a chance to make a 
better life for himself. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the image many people might conjure up when considering trade 
schools. Stories abound of unscrupulous trade school operators who induce 
unwitting and poorly educated people to take their classes, only to provide 
them with shoddy instruction by unqualified teachers. Initially lured by the 
promise of better-paying jobs, these students often quit halfway through, 
disillusioned and no more employable than they were when they began. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the happy stories of disadvantaged people who establish 
successful careers after learning new skills at a vocational school. Take 
Laverne Green, a single mother who was holding down two jobs to make ends meet. 
She entered Pacific Coast College and emerged two years ago as a licensed 
vocational nurse. Green says she has a very rewarding job working with 
quadriplegic patients. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen no doubt wishes he could spend more time promoting success stories such 
as Green's. Instead, he's had to spend much of the past year answering a 
barrage of inquiries regarding problems at the Encino-based firm, which owns 
Pacific Coast and other trade and technical schools. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than a year ago, UES was a fast-growing, profitable company. Then 
it all came tumbling down. A government review uncovered widespread bungling at 
UES' student loan servicing subsidiary. The problems, which included failure to 
properly contact delinquent borrowers, led to several lawsuits and an 
announcement by Bank of America that it and other banks could lose as much as 
$650 million because of the fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America was the trustee for bonds used by California Student Loan 
Finance Corp., a nonprofit corporation, to buy the loans from the lending 
institutions that originated them. 
</P>
<P>
UES has since abandoned the loan-servicing business, having sold that unit to 
Bank of America. But the firm is still grappling with shareholders' lawsuits 
and remains dogged by lingering negative publicity from the loan-servicing 
snafu. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which posted $4.4 million in net income in the fiscal year that 
ended Jan. 31, 1988, lost $14.3 million last year and earned just $24,000 in 
the quarter that ended April 30. Its stock has plunged from its 1988 high of 
$16.375 a share to about $2, and lately there have been signs that the company 
could become a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of unhappy clients as a result of what happened there," said a 
financial analyst who asked not to be identified. "Basically, I lost confidence 
in management." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen wants to talk about anything but the loan-servicing troubles these days. 
He said he has explained all he can on the matter: The problems stemmed from a 
computer system that had run amok, and yes, he admitted, someone should have 
minded the store more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
UES is focusing on mending its bruised image and running its 25 trade schools. 
Bolstering efforts to turn the company around is a new management team headed 
by C. Ronald Kimberling, a former assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of 
Education and more recently executive director of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Foundation. Kimberling signed up in March as UES' senior vice 
president of internal audit and governmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Richard P. Reinhardt, a former deputy director of the 
California Student Aid Commission who is United Education's vice president of 
administration, and Margaret G. Orem, another former Education Department 
official who joined the firm as assistant vice president of internal audit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bolstering Image 
</P>
<P>
These management changes may smack of an attempt to gain some badly needed 
credibility, but observers say that's exactly what UES needs. The company "has 
made the proper changes, perhaps too late to change the image of the company, 
but they've made the proper changes in terms of the quality of personnel," said 
Jeffrey Kessler, a Shearson Lehman Hutton financial analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberling described his newly created position as the firm's "sensor and 
radar." His main task is to ensure that UES' schools are in compliance with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply feel that it's got to be seen and believed that we're trying to do 
the right thing," Kimberling said. "We've learned and adapted to a new 
management" that wants to get "back to the basics," he said. "We're into the 
care and feeding and nurturing of our schools." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kimberling, the company has a new chief operating officer, 
Crawford Lee Benedict. "In the past, I used to do both," Cohen said. "I'd be 
operations and I'd be checking on myself. You can't do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Redeeming Reputation 
</P>
<P>
Still, bad images die hard. The company "will be under a cloud for a while," 
said Boniface Zaino, manager of the TCW Value Added Fund, a mutual fund that is 
one of UES' major institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
UES also is trying to stage its comeback at a time when profits don't come 
easily in the vocational school business. Faced with the cost of complying with 
tighter government regulations, coupled with a consistently low unemployment 
rate that makes it more difficult to attract students, many trade school 
operators will be forced to close their doors in the months ahead, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole industry is finding it tough because unemployment is low," said 
analyst Seth Feinstein of the investment firm Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, when unemployment was high and regulations were more lax, 
trade school firms could earn about 10 cents per dollar of revenue, Cohen said. 
"In today's market, breaking even is very nice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein predicted UES would break even this year, barring an upsurge in 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vowing Persistence 
</P>
<P>
But Cohen insisted he's in the business for the long haul. While UES' 
restructuring is costly and profits may be out of the company's grasp for some 
time, "We're committed that we're going to make it through this period," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One way the company is doing that is by focusing on niche markets. Several 
under-performing schools have been sold and others consolidated, while the ones 
remaining aim at pockets of demand. 
</P>
<P>
Its three aircraft mechanic schools, for instance, are filling a void in the 
airline industry. Graduates of its oceaneering school are helping repair the 
Exxon Valdez, the oil tanker that ran aground in Alaska. A shortage of truck 
drivers is spurring Cohen to consider whether to begin a trucking school. 
</P>
<P>
UES also is trying to get student-loan default rates down with such new 
measures as requiring students to be enrolled at least five days before 
applying for government-backed loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost to Taxpayers 
</P>
<P>
High default rates are of great concern to the Department of Education, which 
estimates defaults on government-guaranteed student loans will cost taxpayers 
$1.9 billion in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
While the new regulations affect all schools whose students have 
government-guaranteed loans, vocational schools notoriously have the highest 
default rates. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, schools with default rates of 60% or more may be dropped 
from the government program and those with default rates of 40% to 60% must 
reduce those rates by five percentage points a year. Only schools with default 
rates below 20% will be unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report on school default rates released Thursday by the 
Education Department, UES' schools have default rates ranging from less than 2% 
to more than 60%. The rates were based on loans that went into default in 1988, 
and will be updated annually to determine whether schools are in compliance 
with the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limits Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Trade school operators argue that default rates can be an unfair and misleading 
measure of a school's performance because many schools are located in poor 
neighborhoods, where students are least able to repay loans on time. The 
alternative to allowing these people to remain untrained is to have them living 
on welfare or other government-supported programs, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Brill, general counsel at trade school operator National Education 
Corp., called the crackdown on default rates absolutely inconsistent with the 
overriding goal of providing training for needy people. "This is what trade 
schools are all trying to tell Washington," he said. "You have to look behind 
the default rates." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cohen said, government regulations will, if anything, get even 
tougher in the future. Part of his company's mission, he said, will be to 
anticipate and prepare for more changes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Takeover 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there has been speculation that the firm will be sold. AIFS, a San 
Francisco company that runs student foreign exchange programs, recently 
revealed that it owns a 5% stake in UES. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Dickstein, an AIFS spokesman, said the company believes UES is undervalued 
and, depending on how the stock performs, might attempt a takeover. UES' 
schools would fit well with AIFS' educational programs, Dickstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the company isn't for sale, although he'd have to consider a valid 
offer. Yet he also said he wants to be in the trade school business forever. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to help people help themselves," he said. "It's a wonderful business."

NO REST FOR FAST-MOVING RESCUER OF BEKINS CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas E. Epley, chairman of Bekins Co., recently moved into a new ground-floor 
office at Bekins' modest, red-brick headquarters building in Glendale. But in 
front of his desk is a wall still undergoing renovation, its wallpaper torn 
away and awaiting a new finish. 
</P>
<P>
The wall is an apt metaphor for Bekins since Epley took the helm of the 
venerable moving company in 1985. At that time, Bekins was listing badly, hurt 
by a disastrous diversification effort and the deregulation of the moving 
industry, which intensified competition and kept downward pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
Epley responded by stripping away all of Bekins' ill-fated acquisitions, which 
ranged from pest control to financial services. "There wasn't a single one of 
them that was viable," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
And once Epley was left with just Bekins' core moving business, he formed a 
group that bought the company from Minneapolis financier Irwin Jacobs for $66 
million in a leveraged buyout in May, 1987. The moving business was barely 
profitable, but Epley was convinced that he could bolster its performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praise From Agents 
</P>
<P>
He has, by many accounts. Several of Bekins' independent agents -- locally 
owned moving companies that represent Bekins -- praised the company for vastly 
improving its computer system, which tracks delivery schedules and billing and 
thus is the lifeblood of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"They are definitely leading the pack" in computer automation, asserted Dennis 
Eversole, general manager of Acme Moving &amp; Storage, a Bekins agent in 
Belmont, Calif. "I would not have said that three years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But like his office wall, Bekins still presents Epley, 48, with work to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The moving business in general is a slow-growth business with profit margins of 
less than 5 cents per dollar of revenue. Bekins' revenue last year edged up 
only 3%, to $325 million from $317 million in 1987. Bekins is profitable, 
although Epley would not disclose any details. 
</P>
<P>
Bekins also faces lots of competition; the company is the nation's 
fifth-largest mover, with about 8% to 10% of the U.S. market. And at the 
moment, industrywide growth is flattening because of slowing housing sales, 
particularly in California, where Bekins is best known. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we've got a real softness in the California market," Epley said. 
"That's caused us a problem." 
</P>
<P>
On the national level, it's also debatable whether Epley has yet lifted Bekins 
a notch in the nationwide moving market, according to Bekins' rivals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hasn't Seen Change 
</P>
<P>
"I have not really seen any change of direction in Bekins," shrugged James L. 
Wilson, executive vice president of United Van Lines, a Fenton, Mo.-based 
concern that is the nation's second-biggest mover. "They don't have a major 
impact on us." 
</P>
<P>
Epley, a Jeannette, Pa., native who earned engineering and business degrees 
from the University of Cincinnati and Northwestern University, respectively, 
has been busy enough trying to improve Bekins' existing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Its two primary divisions are Bekins Van Lines and Bekins Moving &amp; Storage. 
The van lines business, which accounts for two-thirds of Bekins' revenue, acts 
as the main conduit between Bekins' agents at each end of a move. The agents, 
either independent or company-owned firms, are the ones that actually pack and 
move the goods. But Bekins' van lines division schedules the packers and 
drivers, bills the customer, arranges for storage, collects the customer's 
money and then doles out the cash to the various parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
The moving and storage division, meanwhile, is composed of Bekins' 
company-owned agents, which are mainly in California, Texas and Florida. Each 
of those agents mostly serves its local area. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond hauling household goods, Epley also is pushing Bekins in other 
moving-related businesses to fatten the company's profits. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Bekins is trying to increase its handling of specialty freight, 
such as computers or other products transported to trade shows. The company 
also moves and installs furnishings for new hotels and retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Stores 
</P>
<P>
And Bekins is expanding the number of its Bekins Boxstores, which are retail 
outlets that pack and ship specialty items -- an antique clock, for example -- 
and which sell boxes, tape and other packing materials for the do-it-yourself 
mover. Bekins already has 17 company-owned stores in California. Last week it 
began making plans to franchise the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Boxes, as mundane as that may be, are very hard to come by that have any 
strength or capabilities for storage or moving," Epley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bekins has no plans for the same type of pell-mell expansion outside of the 
moving business that it pursued a decade ago and that Epley had to dismantle. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking elsewhere for growth," Epley said. "We're working from 
within; we're trying to make sure we've got that last fine-tuning in place." 
</P>
<P>
Bekins traces its roots to 1891, when Martin and John Bekins, sons of a Dutch 
immigrant, founded the company in Sioux City, Iowa., with three horse-drawn 
vans, a warehouse and 12 workers. Four years later, they moved the operation to 
Los Angeles and opened their headquarters in an old van with the wheels 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
The Bekins family retained control of the company for the next several decades, 
but by the early 1980s, a now publicly held Bekins -- its poor acquisitions and 
deregulation taking their toll -- became the target of a takeover fight between 
two corporate raiders, the Belzberg family of Canada and Irwin Jacobs. Jacobs 
won with a $92-million purchase completed in 1983. No Bekins family members are 
still involved in management. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Jacobs to run Bekins, Epley had spent 15 years at FMC Corp., a 
major producer of machinery, chemicals and defense systems. He became known as 
a trouble-shooter, at various times heading up struggling FMC units involved 
with specialty chemicals, phosphorous chemicals and defense products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Problems 
</P>
<P>
"I tended to gravitate toward the businesses that had the biggest problems and 
biggest negative trends," he said. "I get very bored managing something that is 
in a steady state where you make a little improvement here and there over 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Epley got just what he wanted at Bekins. After Jacobs hired him, Epley 
overhauled Bekins' management in addition to its computer system. He also pared 
Bekins' entire work force by 7% -- to about 2,000 from 2,150 -- and otherwise 
claims to have cut Bekins' overhead costs by more than $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides saving money, Epley's moves have made Bekins more efficient, to hear 
some of Bekins' agents tell it. Dan Kaske, owner of Apace Moving Systems, an 
agent in Orange, said that before Epley took over, Bekins "was notoriously 
very, very slow in paying their agents," often taking up to 90 days. Bekins' 
new computer system "enables us to pretty well get paid in a 45-day period," 
Kaske said. 
</P>
<P>
Epley's plan is to maintain steady, albeit thin, profits at the core moving 
business and to pad those earnings with its new ventures in hauling specialized 
freight and operating packing/shipping stores. But if housing sales continue 
dropping or the overall economy weakens to otherwise depress demand for moving 
services, Epley could have his hands full. 
</P>
<P>
Epley's group acquired Bekins in a leveraged buyout, meaning the group borrowed 
most of the money using Bekins' assets as collateral. Bekins will have to make 
payments on that debt for the next several years -- whether business is 
improving or not. 
</P>
<P>
And Epley might have a hard time finding places to save cash if profits are 
squeezed further. After all, he said of the company, "we've basically gotten it 
as lean as it can be."

VALLEY EARNINGS: AME LOSES $213,157; CITES COSTS OF BUYOUT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AME Inc., a Burbank provider of post-production services for the entertainment 
industry, said it lost $213,157 in its fiscal third quarter, compared with a 
$126,654 profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter ended June 30 came despite a 28% increase in AME's 
revenue, to $15.3 million from $12.0 million. The company blamed the loss on 
costs related to a proposal by an investor group to purchase AME. 
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Lawrence J. Berkowitz, agreed last month to pay $57 million 
for AME's stock and to assume about $42 million of AME's debt outstanding. The 
price includes $10 a share for the 44% stake held by AME founder and chairman 
Andrew M. McIntyre, and $12.50 a share for the remaining stock. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of its fiscal year, AME lost $190,625, compared with 
year-earlier profit of $2.30 million. Nine-month revenue climbed 38% to $47.4 
million from $34.3 million.

THEATER / MARK I. PINSKY: CULTURE CLASH: LATINO SATIRE ON A 'MISSION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCOMark I. Pinsky 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the piety and the protests, about the only thing missing so far from the 
emotional campaign to elevate Father Junipero Serra to sainthood has been a 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
No more. In a biting, multimedia revue called "The Mission," three young Latino 
comedians calling themselves Culture Clash are taking an irreverent look at the 
18th-Century Franciscan who founded Mission San Juan Capistrano and eight 
others in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The group characterizes the play as a brown -- rather than a black -- comedy, 
and true to the spirit of Lenny Bruce, there is something to offend just about 
everyone in "The Mission," starting with the opening narration. 
</P>
<P>
As Herbert Siguenza, dressed in a Franciscan habit and posed like one of the 
many Serra statues, is bathed in a small pool of light, a disembodied voice 
solemnly intones the achievements of the "Apostle of California" beatified last 
fall by Pope John Paul II. Then the kicker: 
</P>
<P>
"One man . . . one vision . . . one million Indios wiped out by murder, disease 
and torture. And at least five known cases of the dreaded jock itch. Father 
Serra loved his little savages. No Indian was buried before his time." 
</P>
<P>
Siguenza, as Serra, then steps down from his pedestal and recalls the 
beatification in Rome, admitting, "Yes, I'm feeling a little smug about the 
whole affair, and why not? . . . One day they will name hospitals and schools 
for me. One day they will construct a stupid statue of me on Highway 280." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Serra's status has focused on how much personal 
responsibility Serra had for the suffering of California Indians under the 
mission system he established. Serra's defenders say that he did the best he 
could and that he should not be judged by contemporary standards. But Indian 
scholars charge that there were those in the church -- even before Serra's time 
-- who believed that native cultures did not have to be crushed in order to 
bring Christianity, and that forceful conversion and corporal punishment were 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Salinas, playing one of Serra's Indian charges, tires of the priest's 
mistreatment and decides to take peyote and travel to the future to warn his 
descendants against canonizing Serra. Salinas emerges 200 years later in San 
Francisco's Mission district as a member of Culture Clash, which is struggling 
to make it in the entertainment mainstream without abandoning its heritage. 
</P>
<P>
For the remainder of the evening, Culture Clash takes a withering look at the 
way European and Anglo civilization has influenced -- often diluting and 
sometimes destroying -- American Indian cultures. Stereotypes and ethnic 
prejudices are favorite topics, and Culture Clash manages to touch most if not 
all of the bases, up to and including "official language" campaigns and Anglo 
resentment over undocumented workers winning the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
But they also look inward. Before the night is over, those who also take hits 
-- some of them loving -- include Edward James Olmos, Fernando Valenzuela, Rita 
Moreno, Jerry Garcia, Carlos Castaneda, Cesar Chavez, Freddy Fender, Erik 
Estrada, Richie Valens, Linda Ronstadt's mariachi band, Che Guevara, Al Pacino 
in "Scarface," Carlos Santana, Jackson Browne, Holly Near, Los Lobos, Bertolt 
Brecht's "fourth wall," the San Francisco Mime Troupe and Barry Manilow. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission" is a low-budget show, produced in association with El Teatro 
Campesino, which began as a guerrilla theater group during the Delano farm 
workers strike. Culture Clash is now a part of El Teatro Campesino, largely 
through the recommendation of Luis Valdez, El Teatro's artistic director and 
the director of "La Bamba." Valdez calls Culture Clash "the cutting edge of 
fresh, new, Latino comic genius." 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission" was honed and reshaped during lab productions at El Teatro 
Campesino's headquarters in San Juan Bautista and in high schools and colleges 
in the Los Angeles area. Playing Los Angeles this fall with its newly polished 
version of "The Mission" is a major goal, Salinas said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the troupe is playing to audiences of 50 people a night in the 
Asian-American Theatre Center, a small San Francisco theater above a pizzeria. 
But Culture Clash appears to be nearing a breakthrough. It has taped an 
eight-minute segment for public television, scheduled for inclusion this fall 
in a nationally televised series, "Comedy Tonight." Last week, Culture Clash 
was featured on National Public Radio's "Morning Edition." Profiles of the 
group are scheduled for California and Mother Jones magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently scatological, the material is uneven and occasionally still rough 
around the edges. In an instant it can go from being silly, juvenile and 
parochial to being subtle, sophisticated and worldly. Culture Clash's humor is 
angry and often political, but not doctrinaire. While most of the satire is 
directed at the dominant European culture, the Left and the counterculture come 
in for their share of jibes. "Politically correct" humor and commitment to La 
Communidad are targets -- "I was a Chicano before you were!" shouts Richard 
Montoya at one point -- and one bit, involving a three-headed, Latin American 
folk singer, is priceless. 
</P>
<P>
Serra is not completely forgotten when the action shifts to the present. A 
brilliant sketch has Siguenza, this time as a member of Culture Clash, taking a 
regular job when his comedy career is stalled. Like several members of the 
group in "Ghostbusters II," Siguenza has been reduced to entertaining at kids' 
parties. So, again dressed as Serra, he takes a job at "Taqueria Serra," where 
he does a hilarious variation of Abbot and Costello's "Who's on First" routine 
about how Anglos choose Mexican restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best bits of the evening are Latino versions of better-known 
efforts. A series of blackout auditions for white producers is similar to the 
one involving black actors in the film "Hollywood Shuffle." A plot to kidnap 
Julio Iglesias -- Siguenza does a dead-on impression -- in order to win a shot 
on national television, kicking off the "Father Serra Camino Real Tour," is 
right out of the "King of Comedy." But, given the universal nature of prejudice 
and ambition, these bits still work well. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe also spoofs several well-known public service announcements on 
television, like the ubiquitous anti-drug message featuring eggs in a frying 
pan. Using story boards, Montoya explains, "This is your brains. . . . This is 
your brains on drugs. . . . This is your brains on drugs with chorizos." 
Siguenza gives a Latin twist to the famous United Negro College appeal, the one 
which recently tripped up Dan Quayle, by complaining that "a Mayan is a 
terrible thing to waste." 
</P>
<P>
Peppered with such wordplay, the evening is sometimes reminiscent of the old 
"Firesign Theater." At one point, Montoya warns Salinas of the pointlessness of 
trying to prevent the canonization, slipping into a spoken and then sung 
version of "Que Serra, Serra." At another point, the troupe, as tough gang 
members, begins a menacing chant of "Colors!" which segues to a cheerful 
rendition of "De Colores." 
</P>
<P>
The gang material is the most original of the evening, and Culture Clash 
members say it travels the best when the group plays urban areas outside 
California, where audiences are unfamiliar with Father Serra. Salinas, Montoya 
and Siguenza -- all raised in middle-class homes -- pull off the extremely 
difficult task of spoofing the deadly serious phenomenon without approving of 
its effects or denigrating the individuals who are caught up in it. Montoya 
said that even gang members have told them how much they like the material 
because it so accurately satirized people they recognize. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old group's members, all of whom live in San Francisco's Mission 
district, range in age from late 20s to early 30s and in education from a year 
in college to two degrees. Salinas and Siguenza are the children of Salvadoran 
immigrants. Montoya is the son of the poet Jose Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, members acknowledged that that they chose the Serra sainthood 
issue primarily as a vehicle to showcase the group's more contemporary work, at 
a time when the San Francisco newspapers were full of the controversy in the 
wake of Pope John Paul II's visit to San Francisco and Carmel, where Serra 
founded another famous mission and where he is buried. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed like the perfect thing for Culture Clash," said Siguenza, 
"because it was a culture clash -- the Spaniards coming into indigenous 
California." 
</P>
<P>
After carefully reading all the pros and cons of the complex sainthood issue, 
Salinas said cheerfully, "We chose the con."

'DOWN THE ROAD' IN LA JOLLA IS BUMPY RIDE TOWARD DEAD END

<TEXT>
<P>
What makes serial killers tick? Why are their numbers growing? What kind of a 
society is it that spawns them? 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Lee Blessing has set himself the impossible task of answering these 
questions. But his new play, "Down the Road," which opened Sunday at the La 
Jolla Playhouse under the direction of Des McAnuff, is as stumped as the 
sociologists. 
</P>
<P>
Blessing, who wrote two other plays staged by McAnuff at La Jolla ("A Walk in 
the Woods," about the private talks of an American and a Soviet arms 
negotiator, and "Two Rooms," about the effects on his family of the taking of a 
political hostage), has made a mini-science of the small-cast, big-issue play. 
</P>
<P>
The approach worked best in "Walk." By the time Blessing had written 
"Eleemosynary," another one-set, witty 90-minute piece about three generations 
of iconoclastic women, the signature style was showing signs of wear. The 
play's Manhattan Theatre Club staging (seen at the Spoleto Festival in May) 
owed most of its success to three talented performers. In "Down the Road," a 
three-way exploration of serial killing, Blessing's formula has reached a dead 
end. He raises the hard questions and, when he can't answer them, aborts the 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Iris and Dan Henniman (Susan Berman and Jonathan Hogan) have landed a 
terrific assignment. They're going to do the book on the life of serial killer 
Bill Reach (James Morrison). Reach, in some forsaken federal prison, is eager 
to cooperate. Dollar signs fairly dance off the project. Think paperbacks, 
think film and television. 
</P>
<P>
Iris and Dan jauntily take up residence in a motel room 10 miles from the 
penitentiary. Ambiance is set up: The view from the window is a rusting water 
heater on someone's front porch. The best restaurant around is McDonald's. And 
it's only going to get tougher, they fairly cluck, as it goes along. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the joys of the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Iris is the experienced interviewer, Dan the novice. For that reason, she tells 
Dan, he must interview Reach first -- set him up while she goes in for the 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
If this hints at sexual politics, Blessing soon drops the ball. Dan's first 
interview proves Iris right. His technique is lousy: He talks too much, asks 
too many leading questions, apologizes a lot. No wonder Reach quickly gains the 
upper hand. This is a guy who knows how to apply a stranglehold. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, he also strangles the play. Blessing made a serious tactical error 
when he decided to allow Reach to talk only about his crimes, never his 
motivations. He's darn proud to have killed 19 women, maybe more. But every 
time he's asked one of those $64 questions about why he killed (as opposed to 
how), Reach clams up. 
</P>
<P>
No talkee, no play. 
</P>
<P>
So we're faced with a double negative: the interview overused as a means of 
disseminating fundamentally dull if needed exposition -- and a protagonist who 
won't speak when it comes to examining what the play's about. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to focus on the large issues, Blessing belabors the small ones: Iris and 
Dan's marital chatter, their separate fantasies, the rusting water heater, a 
forced outrage at this murderer's evil (what did they expect?), topped by an 
ending not organically connected to the play. 
</P>
<P>
Iris, who has become pregnant in the course of the investigation, suddenly 
decides she doesn't want to go on with a project that has become distasteful. 
(Why is not made especially clear, though a thin thread of reason is 
established between her impending motherhood and Reach's killing of a 
10-year-old girl.) 
</P>
<P>
More inexplicably, the marriage threatens to fall apart when Dan suggests that 
he has the right to go on with the project alone. There is lots of indignation 
and even a curious tape-burning scene that can only charitably be described as 
borrowed from "Hedda Gabler." 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff moves everybody around nicely. Composer Michael Roth (with designer 
John Kilgore) has provided an appropriately chilling sound score, and Neil 
Patel an efficient double-duty set -- part motel room, part maximum security 
prison. Lights (Peter Maradudin) and costumes (Sudan Hiferty) complete the 
garnish. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member cast is able, though the play makes no heavy-duty demands on 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Warren Theatre on the UCSD campus. Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; 
matinees Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m., through Sept. 17. "Pay What You Can"

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
NOMINATION PERIOD FOR SOME OFFICES EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nomination period for candidates in several district elections has been 
extended until Aug. 16, county Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The extension from the original deadline of Aug. 11 was called for elections in 
the Orange Unified School District, trustee areas 4 and 7; the Santa Ana 
Unified School District; Anaheim School District; Three Arch Bay Community 
Service District and the Silverado-Modjeska Park and Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
The election is Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Warner, an election section supervisor, said the extension was granted 
because a number of incumbents had not filed their nomination papers by Aug. 
11. Incumbents are barred from filing during the extension period. "Some people 
do not wish to run against an incumbent," Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
The extension, therefore, is intended to give people the chance to file knowing 
whether the incumbent has decided to seek reelection, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The papers are to be filed at the registrar of voters office, 1300-C S. Grand 
Ave., Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
For information, call the registrar at (714) 567-7600.

SERVICE FOR UPLAND BOY TO BE CONDUCTED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service will be conducted today for Jason Matthew Lea, the 
9-year-old Upland boy whose body was found 10 days ago at the bottom of a 
ravine in the San Gabriel Mountains, officials of the Adam Walsh Child Resource 
Center in Westminster announced Monday at a press conference in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Jason disappeared July 29 after leaving his home on his bicycle. His decomposed 
body was discovered Aug. 4 in a ravine below Glendora Ridge Road, two miles 
west of the San Bernardino County line in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster center has been helping Jason's family since the boy 
disappeared. The center, one of four nationwide, has been assisting in finding 
missing children since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Four teen-agers had been held in connection with the death, but there was 
insufficient evidence to charge them with a crime, officials with the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office said. Three were released last week, 
and the fourth is being held on an unrelated probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman said the cause of death probably will 
not be determined until the middle of this week. 
</P>
<P>
The service will begin at 10 a.m. at the Eleventh Street Baptist Church in 
Upland. 
</P>
<P>
Parents at Baldy View Elementary School, where Jason was a pupil, have set up a 
trust fund in his name.

GARDEN GROVE DRIVER SURVIVES CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDING TRUCK OVERTURNS AND CATCHES FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A trucker reportedly driving more than 80 m.p.h. on La Palma Avenue in Buena 
Park early Monday apparently fell asleep at the wheel, sending his big-rig 
tractor into a 320-foot skid during which it crashed through some trees, 
flipped over and burst into flames, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
The tractor was so badly damaged that police could not at first determine its 
make. Yet the driver, Henry H. Herrera, 52, of Garden Grove, escaped with only 
a broken left arm and scratches and bruises, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Lt. Gary Hicken said Herrera was found unconscious in some 
bushes about 30 feet from the charred truck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing this guy made it," Hicken said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera sustained the arm injury when he was thrown from the cab of the 
tractor, Hicken said. He was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he 
was admitted and underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
No other vehicles were involved in the accident, and no one else was injured, 
Hicken said. 
</P>
<P>
Blood-alcohol tests conducted at the medical center indicated that Herrera had 
not been drinking, Police Officer Richard McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Larry Hainley, a police traffic investigator, said Herrera's tractor, 
which was not pulling a trailer, was traveling west on La Palma Avenue near La 
Fiesta Drive at about 1 a.m. when the crash occurred. The intersection is about 
two blocks from Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Hainley said witnesses reported seeing the tractor run several red lights at 
speeds exceeding 80 m.p.h. The vehicle left skid marks as long as a football 
field before careening to the side of the street, ramming two palm trees, 
flipping over and coming to rest upside down. 
</P>
<P>
As the tractor overturned, its diesel fuel tank tore away and ignited, and two 
of the tractor's three axles were torn off, Hainley said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera "probably was ejected from the truck through the front windshield," 
which saved his life, Hainley said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Herrera owned the truck, police said. A check Monday 
morning with the Department of Motor Vehicles indicated that Herrera either was 
in the process of purchasing the truck or was selling it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Herrera's wife, Arlene, Herrera has been driving tractor-trailers 
for his brother's trucking company in Chino. She said that Herrera has been in 
the trucking business for 40 years and is a good driver with a clean record.

ROAR HERALDS NIGHT-LANDING PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighborhoods around the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro will experience 
increased noise during the evening this week as fighter aircraft practice 
simulated night carrier landings, base officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
FA-18 Hornet jets based at El Toro hold night practice sessions several times a 
year, Maj. Jim McClain said. The fighters will be landing on a runway lighted 
and marked like the deck of an aircraft carrier from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. through 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier landing practice is particularly bad for those with sensitive ears 
because "there is a two- to three-hour period of constant roar with no break," 
Lt. Col. Gary Albin said. 
</P>
<P>
Albin defended the exercises as essential preparation for young pilots who next 
must land on aircraft carriers at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like the boat but without the pitch and roll," Albin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines selected El Toro as a landing strip in 1942 in part because it was 
close enough to the ocean that pilots could practice carrier landings at sea. 
At that time, the air station was in an isolated rural area and planes were 
powered by less noisy propellers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the thunderous screams of low-flying Marine Corps jets reverberate in 
the closely packed housing tracts around the base. The air station receives 
about 500 noise complaints a year, Albin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said complaints come from Laguna Hills, Turtle Rock in Irvine, Modjeska in 
the foothills to the east, and other areas around the base. 
</P>
<P>
In the carrier simulation exercise each pilot makes five to eight 
"touch-and-go" landings at the air field. 
</P>
<P>
After taking off toward Saddleback Mountain on east-west Runway 7 and flying 
out over the ocean, the jets come in over Laguna Hills and the Leisure World 
community, flying low over the Santa Ana Freeway on approach to north-south 
Runway 34. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of stopping, the planes touch down on the runway and immediately 
take off again, turning left toward Jeffrey Road, making a circle over the 
freeways and the Wild Rivers theme park before coming back to land on Runway 34 
again. 
</P>
<P>
McClain said the jet noise will affect the local neighborhoods in east Irvine, 
Laguna Hills and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who wish to file a noise complaint with the El Toro Air Station 
should call the operations duty officer at (714) 726-3830 for fixed-wing 
aircraft or (714) 726-7884 for helicopters, Albin said.

FALLING ANGELS FLATTENED BY THE TWINS, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Post-Oakland depression hit the Angels hard Monday night. The high from 
Sunday's exhilarating victory over the Athletics dissipated quickly, bottoming 
out during a 6-3 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
You want offense? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels managed 10 hits in 7 2/3 innings against Minnesota starter Allan 
Anderson, but could turn only two of them into something tangible, such as 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
You want pitching? 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Kirk McCaskill gave up hits to the first batters he faced, both 
Twins eventually scoring. By the sixth inning, he had given up nine hits and 
five runs, and by the seventh inning, he was done. 
</P>
<P>
You want defense? 
</P>
<P>
Angel left fielder Chili Davis provided a few innings' worth of 1988 
flashbacks, when he wreaked havoc in right field, by committing one error -- 
which led to one Minnesota run -- and reacting creatively to a couple of other 
balls hit in his direction. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Minnesota had 15 hits against three Angel pitchers, which were two 
more hits than the Angels had against three Minnesota pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the outcome never seemed in doubt, with the Twins opening as much as a 6-1 
advantage before the first out of the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Playing idly on a night the A's were idle, the Angels lost another half-game in 
the AL West standings and trail Oakland by 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill was in trouble from the outset, giving up a leadoff single to Al 
Newman, who was promptly advanced to third by Dan Gladden's double. 
</P>
<P>
Just the way you like to face Kirby Puckett for the first time of the night: 
With no outs and two runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett got one run home by grounding out to second base. Clean-up hitter Randy 
Bush drove in the other with a single to left field, giving the Twins a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels countered with a run in the bottom of the first -- not bad, but 
still far from what might have been. In the inning, the Angels had three 
singles, hit one ball to the wall and another near the warning track, yet 
entered the second inning trailing, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
After Devon White's leadoff drive the sent Puckett crashing into the 
center-field fence for the out, Brian Downing, back in the lineup for the first 
time in more than a week, bounced a single up the middle. Then Johnny Ray flied 
out to deep left field before Downing could advance to second on Wally Joyner's 
broken-bat bloop single. 
</P>
<P>
Downing scored on a single by Chili Davis, which also moved Joyner to third 
base. But there both runners remained as Tony Armas grounded into an 
inning-ending force play. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, the Angel defense began to break down. Bush opened the 
inning with a flare to left field, which should have dropped for a single but 
wound up skipping under Davis' glove for an error, allowing Bush to take 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, Bush scored Minnesota's third run on catcher Brian Harper's 
single. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill worked a scoreless inning in the fifth, only to work his way into 
further difficulty in the sixth. With one out, Gary Gaetti singled and Jim 
Dwyer walked, with Harper's sharp grounder to third base moving both runners 
into scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
And score they did, with John Moses blooping a hit down the left field line and 
into Davis territory again. Finally collecting the base, Davis made amends, of 
sort, by firing to second baseman Johnny Ray, who slapped a tag on Moses to 
close out the inning. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill pitched to one more batter, Wally Backman, who opened the seventh 
inning with a double into the left-field corner. On came Angel relief pitcher 
Greg Minton, whose problems of late -- three home runs in his previous two 
innings -- continued. 
</P>
<P>
Minton yielded hits to the first two Twins he faced, the first, a single by 
Newman, scoring Backman with Minnesota's sixth run. It took a sliding catch in 
right field by Armas on a Puckett line drive to get the Angels out of the 
inning without greater damage. 
</P>
<P>
Minton came back to complete a scoreless eighth inning -- aided by a 
double-play ground ball -- but was unable to finish the ninth. After 
sandwiching two singles around two outs, Minton was replaced by Bob McClure, 
who retired pinch-hitter Greg Larkin on a line drive to second base. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson (14-9) was pulled in the eighth inning for different reasons. 
Complaining of a slight twinge in his upper back, Anderson gave way to reliever 
Juan Berenguer with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Berenguer walked Armas and gave up a single to Lance Parrish. This was followed 
by a double down the left-field line by pinch-hitter Jack Howell that scored 
Armas and might have scored Parrish had a fan not reached over the field-box 
railing and touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Fan's interference was called, holding Parrish at third. And there Parrish was 
stranded when Kent Anderson grounded to first for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon was summoned to pitch the ninth inning and he retired the side in 
order, earning his 22nd save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Only in Anaheim, only in 1989: It's the 14th day of August. The Angels are one 
game out of first in the West. And starting on the left side of their infield 
Monday night were Kent Anderson at shortstop and Bobby Rose at third base. 
Angel Manager Doug Rader gave Rose, 23, his first major league start in the 
heat of pennant race, teaming him with rookie Anderson, the injury-replacement 
for Dick Schofield. Why? Because Rader wanted to give his regular third 
baseman, Jack Howell, a night away from the pennant race. Howell is mired in a 
three-for-34 slump and was coming off a particularly rough series, both in the 
field and at the plate, against Oakland. "I just wanted to get Jackie away from 
it, like I've done with others from time to time," Rader said. "He can get away 
to work with Deron (Johnson, Angel hitting coach) with the batting cage without 
the pressure of playing today." Rose was recalled from double-A Midland last 
week to fill the roster vacancy created when Schofield was placed on the 21-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitters Brian Downing and Claudell Washington traded places Monday, 
with Downing returning to the lineup in time to replace Washington, who was 
sidelined after receiving a cortisone injection in his left shoulder Sunday 
afternoon. Downing hadn't played since Aug. 4 because of a flare-up of his 
chronic rib-cage condition. Washington was available only for pinch-run duty 
and figures to be a few days away from returning to the Angel outfield. . . . 
Reserve catcher Bill Schroeder was also relegated to the bench after receiving 
a cortisone shot in his right elbow Sunday. Schroeder underwent elbow surgery 
when he played for Milwaukee in 1986 and, according to Angel trainer Rick 
Smith, has had periodic problems with inflammation in the elbow ever since. 
With starter Lance Parrish playing with a tightly wrapped sore rib cage, rookie 
John Orton, 23, was the lone able-bodied catcher on the Angel roster. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven, the 38-year-old who may never grow up, still gets a kick out of 
watching things blow up. For Monday's prank, Blyleven strolled quietly past a 
huddle of sportswriters in the Angel clubhouse and nonchalantly dropped a 
firecracker on the floor. Off it went within feet of the writers, rattling a 
few eardrums and causing Rader to open the door of his office and peer out at 
the smoke. "Schoey, stop fooling around," he yelled at Schofield, the 
mild-mannered shortstop who usually makes about as much noise as a resin bag. 
Blyleven and Rader both grinned knowingly and then went off to resume their 
daily rounds.

AILING TEXAS S&amp;L CONSIDERS SELLING ITS STAKE IN BUILDER J.M. PETERS INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A troubled Texas thrift says it is considering selling its stake in J. M. 
Peters Co. Inc. of Newport Beach, one of Southern California's largest home 
builders. 
</P>
<P>
A sale has long been expected, as San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of 
Houston has been ailing for some time; the thrift reported a loss of $100 
million for the fiscal year that ended in June. 
</P>
<P>
San Jacinto said late last week that it had hired the investment banking firm 
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to evaluate its alternatives with respect to 
Peters and to two other subsidiaries, including the sale of those. 
</P>
<P>
San Jacinto is itself a subsidiary of a troubled company, Southmark Corp. of 
Dallas. Southmark reported a loss of $1 billion for its third quarter, and it 
filed for bankruptcy last month. 
</P>
<P>
Peters says a sale would not interrupt its business, which is building 
expensive homes in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Peters' stock has been rising the last few weeks on speculation that San 
Jacinto would sell its 87% stake in Peters. Stock analysts say the company 
could fetch more than $250 million. San Jacinto bought Peters in 1985, 
reportedly for $21 million. 
</P>

Hiring an investment banker to study selling Peters -- one of Southmark's crown 
jewels -- is the latest chapter in the saga of Southmark, a once high-flying 
real estate investment firm brought low by the crash in Texas real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Southmark raised $10.5 million in 1987 by selling nearly 13% of Peters' stock 
-- 1.75 million shares -- to the public. In the last few years, Southmark has 
been forced to consider selling as much as $500 million in assets to meet its 
debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
San Jacinto tried to sell Peters early last year to another troubled real 
estate investor, MDC Holdings Inc. of Denver, for $100 million in notes. That 
deal fell through last year at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
What is likely to happen to Peters? San Jacinto will not say, but stock 
analysts posit two plausible scenarios: (1) that the rest of Peters' stock -- 
about 12 million shares -- may be sold to the public; (2) that San Jacinto may 
sell its stake to another company. 
</P>
<P>
Having so little Peters' stock in the public's hands -- about 2 million shares 
-- has kept the price down, stock analysts say. The tie to Southmark probably 
hurt the stock price, too, they say. With that tie severed, and with more stock 
on the market, the price is likely to go up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Severe Discount' 
</P>
<P>
"There was a severe discount (in the stock's price) because of the small 
float," said Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Barbara Allen. 
</P>
<P>
With a sale to another company, Allen said, a buyer from out of state eager to 
break into the hot California market would be most likely, although a foreign 
buyer is a possibility too. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the company might sell for as much as $20 a share, or $280 
million, Allen said. She said investors have undervalued Peters stock, now 
trading at $13.75 a share on the American Stock Exchange. (The stock closed up 
12.5 cents Monday as 17,000 shares changed hands.) 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't quite so sure. Michael Kirby, who follows real estate investment 
trusts at Newport Beach's Green Street Advisors Inc., says he thinks home 
builders' earnings have peaked and that investors will probably lose interest 
in that stock. 
</P>
<P>
"These companies have seen some extremely high earnings, which can't be 
sustained," Kirby said. "I'd be surprised if somebody paid a large premium to 
buy a company like Peters." 
</P>
<P>
A third possibility is that Jim Peters, who founded the company in 1975, could 
buy it. Analysts, however, do not think that scenario is likely because the 
company would have to take on a massive debt. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, like San Jacinto, will not say what form a sale is likely to take. 
</P>
<P>
The company expects another strong year after the bedlam of 1988, when whole 
sections of subdivisions would sell out moments after going on the market. 
Prices went through the roof -- Orange County houses are among the most 
expensive in the nation -- and builders' profits surged. 
</P>
<P>
Things are quieter this year, although there is still enough action for Peters 
to make substantial money. The company says it has had fewer houses to sell 
recently because of the timing of its construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Peters sold $57.5 million worth of houses during its first quarter ended May 
31; the first-quarter figure for last year was $89.6 million. Profits were $5 
million for the first quarter and $7.3 million for the period last year. Peters 
said the company expects to have a much stronger second quarter, when it will 
finish many more new houses.

ON STAGE AT WOODSTOCK;

<P>
LAGUNA'S NANCY DE JONGH, WHO SANG IN SWEETWATER, RECALLS FESTIVAL'S CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 20 years ago today that Nancy Nevins de Jongh walked on stage during the 
opening hours of Woodstock and began to sing. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the epochal festival on a farm in Upstate New York has taken on 
a burnished glow in rock lore: a gathering of peaceful tribes. The high-water 
mark of the '60s counterculture. The birth of the commercial giant and 
mass-media force that rock was to become. 
</P>
<P>
For de Jongh, whose band, Sweetwater, was the third act on the bill, Woodstock 
was nothing so lofty or enduring. It was a weekend that began with no great 
expectations, unfolded with worry, discomfort and frustration, devolved into 
farce and ended with regret. Twenty years on, de Jongh and Sweetwater have 
subsided into virtual oblivion, despite having played rock's most famous show. 
</P>
<P>
But as de Jongh sat the other day in her sunlit apartment overlooking the ocean 
in Laguna Beach, relating a tale that she seldom has been called upon to tell, 
there was nothing melancholy in the recounting. In the words of those more 
famed veterans of Woodstock, the Grateful Dead, a rock 'n' roll life brings the 
prerogative of being able to sit back and smile over "what a long, strange trip 
it's been." De Jongh's story certainly qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
Today she is a tall, trim woman whose appearance combines a professional look 
with an art-colony aesthetic: conservative, pastel-colored clothing, reddish 
hair worn in a neat, fashionable cut, an array of silver rings on her hands, 
and large, geometric metal shapes dangling from her ears. 
</P>
<P>
When she walked out in front of all those people late in the afternoon of Aug. 
15, 1969, she was Nansi Nevins, a tall, willowy 19-year-old with long, brown 
hair, a flowing peasant dress and a pure, forthright voice not unlike Grace 
Slick's. With her were the seven other musicians -- all men -- who made up 
Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Los Angeles, Sweetwater was notable for an ethnic makeup that included 
a black, two Latinos and a Czech, and for a musical lineup that de-emphasized 
guitar while making room for a folk-jazz-rock fusion featuring cello, piano, 
conga drums and flute. 
</P>
<P>
By the summer of '69, the group was making its way eagerly in the rock world, 
having released "Sweetwater," the first of three albums it would record for 
Reprise Records in 1969-71. The album notes heralded the band as "eight 
high-octane musicians who met and jammed in the great peanut butter octopus 
that is Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
When Woodstock rolled around, Sweetwater was an established touring attraction 
that had played the Fillmores East and West and shared bills with the likes of 
the Who, the Doors and Janis Joplin. 
</P>
<P>
Nansi Nevins' trip through '60s rock had begun with coffeehouse blues shows, 
played when she was still a Glendale high school girl. Early in 1967, she 
stepped on stage with an unwieldy, 26-piece jam band called Jay Walker and the 
Pedestrians and sang "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child." In 
concentrated form, that group coalesced as Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
They were taken in hand by a well-connected manager, Bruce Glattman, who got 
them a record deal and set them up with prominent bookings. "Bruce was a good 
friend of Bill Graham," de Jongh recalled. "Graham booked us in the Fillmore 
all the time -- East and West. We had a following, and we were a draw. I 
suppose that's how we got the Woodstock booking." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater figured it was nothing to get too excited about. "We were on the 
circuit of pop festivals," she said. "They were generally just hot and sweaty, 
and the music was hard to hear. We thought it was just another festival." 
</P>
<P>
On the Friday that began Woodstock, Sweetwater checked in at the Holiday Inn in 
Liberty, N.Y., which was a staging ground and nerve center for the festival's 
performers and organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like everyone was running around with their heads cut off," de Jongh 
said in a modulated, soft-textured voice. "I thought, 'Now, this is a mess.' I 
hadn't seen that before (at festivals). Usually they were a lot more 
controlled. This one was really chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
"We just plunked our bags in our rooms and threw on some clothes. It was a 
muggy, hot August day. We figured we'd jump in the car and just go out there to 
the stage. And then immediately the car stopped on this one-lane road, and 
anxiety set in. Just total gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers sent out helicopters to ferry stranded musicians to the festival. 
Having never flown in a helicopter, de Jongh had a frightful ride during which 
she thought of a harrowing plane flight Sweetwater had taken during a snowy 
tour of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
When the band arrived backstage, Richie Havens had already finished the 
festival-opening set that pretty much made his career. On stage was act number 
two: a band of Hare Krishnas chanting in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh said: "I thought, 'What could this be? This is ridiculous.' I had a 
cynical outlook at this point. It was really crazy." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh saw more signs of disorganization at the festival site. Amid the 
scurry, she picked up bits of discomfiting information: Organizers had lost 
control of the entrances, and people were pouring in without tickets. And a 
storm was blowing in. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh has few distinct memories of Sweetwater's performance, other than that 
she was disappointed to find that there was a 15-foot-wide photographers' pit 
separating the stage from the audience. Sweetwater's act usually involved lots 
of close-range interaction with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a standard 45-minute set. I remember thinking that the other band 
members seemed really far away. We were spread out (on the large stage). It 
sounds hokey, but the crowd had really good vibes. It was hard not to just 
stare back at them, because it was so big." 
</P>
<P>
Even with good vibes from the audience, de Jongh and the other members still 
had deep misgivings about what they perceived as the lack of organization 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt kind of dangerous," she said. "I felt real harassed. And you felt real 
powerless and out of control. But if I was in the crowd, I probably would have 
thought 'What a great party!' 
</P>
<P>
"It always seemed while we were there that everything was on the edge of 
falling apart. By Saturday, everything probably got calmer because they knew 
what was going on by then. But Friday, nobody knew, and it could go either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater had already played on bills with many of the famous acts that were 
to follow, so band members thought that they would not be missing much by 
leaving right away. But leaving was not. Helicopters were coming in regularly 
at the backstage landing area, but there was a crush of people who had the same 
idea as Sweetwater and wanted to get back to the Holiday Inn. De Jongh recalled 
running repeatedly to catch a copter, only to be frustrated when someone else 
got there first. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours passed, she and three others from Sweetwater were airborne. 
But within minutes, the helicopter was dropping in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to go down," she said. "I remember thinking, 'We're gonna die!' " 
But the pilot managed to set the helicopter down at a tiny airfield somewhere 
near the festival. From there, he drove off in a car with two field attendants, 
abandoning the rockers to fend for themselves. They used a pay phone to summon 
help, but no help arrived until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
When they got back to the Holiday Inn, de Jongh said, they found that other 
band members who had driven there from the festival had smashed the roof of 
their U-Haul truck into the hotel's entrance overhang. 
</P>
<P>
"What could happen next? We decided we'd better get out of there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The band drove to New York City, got on a plane and returned to Los Angeles. By 
the time they got back, "it was all over the news" that Woodstock had been a 
landmark event. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh said: "We were thinking, 'Gosh, you're kidding.' We flew home, only to 
discover it was Woodstock we'd fled from. All I've heard for 20 years is what a 
great time everybody had. Sometimes I feel real sorry for myself. It was like 
missing a party." 
</P>
<P>
But missing out on history was soon the least of de Jongh's problems. In 
December, 1969, a few days after Sweetwater had played on national TV on the 
Red Skelton Show, a drunk driver rammed into her car on the Ventura Freeway. 
The wreck put her in a 10-day coma and caused permanent damage to her vocal 
chords. 
</P>
<P>
She worked to rehabilitate her voice, which took on a rougher, tawnier hue. But 
de Jongh's injury and the layoff that followed were the first in a series of 
internal strains for Sweetwater that led to its breakup in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so determined to keep going," de Jongh said. "I moved into a little room 
in Laurel Canyon with a piano, and I started to learn more about the music 
business and about writing a tune." She emerged in 1975 with a solo album for 
Tom Cat Records, a subsidiary of RCA. But the label folded, de Jongh said, and 
her career became nebulous again. 
</P>
<P>
Her last public performance was a charity show at a veterans hospital in 1977. 
"I got real, real tired and stressed out," she said, and decided to try family 
life instead. She married in 1978 and moved to Laguna Beach. By 1980, she was 
divorced and scraping for money. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no job skills," she said. "I started housecleaning for a living. I was 
real confused. I didn't know if I could make it in music again." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh stopped telling most people about her rock 'n' roll past: "I got real 
quiet. Housecleaning is real good for your humility. Would you believe it if 
your housecleaner came in and said, 'I used to have a Mercedes and four 
albums?' It was real character-building." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh turned to writing in her spare time, while putting herself through 
college with her earnings as a housekeeper and a tutor. Now, no longer cleaning 
house, she is working toward a master's degree in English at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, 20 years after Woodstock, she will step onto a smaller stage 
for a performance that may ultimately prove more significant in her personal, 
long, strange trip through life. The stage will be a classroom at Cal State 
Fullerton, where de Jongh will tackle her first regular teaching assignment as 
a part-time instructor in the college's basic writing program. 
</P>
<P>
Fiction writing is her main creative outlet these days. Although she still 
keeps an upright piano in her apartment, the prominent spot with the ocean view 
belongs to a computer terminal and printer. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh has fallen out of touch with her former Sweetwater band mates: August 
Burns, Alex Del Zoppo, Fred Herrera, Albert B. Moore, Elpidio Cobian, R.G. 
Carlyle and Alan Malarowitz. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally don't tell people about it," she said of her life as a '60s 
rocker. But with the much-publicized festival anniversary upon us, de Jongh 
decided it might be time to recall Sweetwater's comic-ironic footnote in 
Woodstock history. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting for 20 years for somebody to ask me what happened," she 
said.

10,000 MANIACS VISIT SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Natalie Merchant, ravishing lead singer and lyricist of the equally ravishing 
rock quintet 10,000 Maniacs, is in many of her songs a consignor in concern -- 
a musical merchant of angered consideration for the poor, the dispossessed, the 
enslaved, abused children, American Indians, Nicaraguans, veterans, 
what-have-you. 
</P>
<P>
Latest cause: the future hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"Shouldn't you be wearing your earplugs?" she asked a security guard standing 
in front of the stageside speakers during a show early Sunday evening at the 
Santa Barbara County Bowl -- the opening of a five-show Southern California 
swing for the band. Said guard indicated that he liked the music too much to 
obstruct his ear canals. 
</P>
<P>
"You like the songs? As much as I like the songs, I wouldn't stand there 
unprotected," she said. The guard dutifully put them in. "Just concerned about 
your safety," Merchant added with a smile, tongue seemingly not very far in 
cheek at all. 
</P>
<P>
If such a penchant for maternal heedfulness suggests that Merchant is some kind 
of rock 'n' roll mother figure, nothing could be further from the truth: What 
didacticism there is in her bears the angry imprimatur of unspoiled, youthful 
idealism carried on and branded into a wide-eyed, tenderhearted, liberally 
world-conscious adulthood that's plenty risky enough. 
</P>
<P>
And in the redoubtable 10,000 Maniacs, she has a world-class band to push her 
into still graceful fits of seeming physical abandon. Much as she hates to hear 
this kind of stuff, she could just be the (gag) sex symbol for a generation, 
the one that sorta identifies with "thirtysomething" but hates its apologetic 
gentility, the one that wants some juice-churning intestinal fortitude with its 
prettiness. 
</P>
<P>
Letting the easily distracted and prone-to-informality Merchant sing for a 
California audience in broad daylight could have been a mistake. Sunday's set 
began shortly after 6 with the group's strongest song, the child-abuse ditty 
"What's the Matter Here?" Merchant was operating by rote at best, thanks to the 
sun in her eyes. The number was redeemed only by a rabid solo by guitarist 
Robert Buck that took the tastefulness of the recorded version and turned it 
inside out -- a sign of terrific things to come. 
</P>
<P>
Once Merchant became shaded later, her performance took better shape even as 
she still spent much of the set nonchalantly observing the sort of things she 
doesn't usually get to in the dark -- the dozens of fluorescent pink T-shirts 
among the largely shorts-clad crowd, the way certain members of the crew at the 
sound board dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Ooh, I see that little boy up there showing his belly to his sister," she 
cooed at one point, then apologized for making them self-conscious: "Didn't 
mean to embarrass you." 
</P>
<P>
Self-consciousness is not a problem of Merchant. She was motionless enough in 
the early portions of the set, befitting her adjustment to the setting, but 
eventually let go with the violent, balletic twists for which she's known, 
joyful pirouettes that really do complement emotional turns in the faster 
songs. (This isn't Stevie Nicks we're talking about.) And she was loose enough 
to exclaim "oops" by the time she hit a sour note in a closing solo piano 
medley. 
</P>
<P>
Her lovely voice with the impossible-to-place accent could sing the proverbial 
Yellow Pages and be believable, but is much more so in the service of a protest 
song such as "Please Forgive Us," a plea of ignorance of Oliver North and the 
likes addressed to a blood-spattered Central America. It was honey in the 
soothing "Trouble Me" and venom in the spiteful "You Happy Puppet," which she 
sang wearing a massive, ugly costume. 
</P>
<P>
The evolution of 10,000 Maniacs from an R.E.M.-like groove-oriented folk-rock 
band to a more pop song-oriented format has been both commercially and 
aesthetically agreeable, but in concert, the group was able to find a fire that 
the recorded mix doesn't usually allow. "Headstrong," a recent track in which 
the band is mixed too low on album, was as noisy and beautifully distorted as 
you'd hope live. 
</P>
<P>
And not enough can be said in commendation of Buck, whose mostly gentle but 
occasionally buck-wild stylization subtly incorporates everything from 
surf-guitar tones to flamenco and who spends an inordinate amount of time 
squeezing out notes from the high end of his guitar neck, making for unusually 
bright tones even in minor keys. 
</P>
<P>
10,000 Maniacs plays the Greek Theatre tonight and Wednesday, with further 
Southland dates Friday at Irvine Meadows and Saturday at San Diego's Open Air 
Amphitheatre. Camper Van Beethoven, a somewhat goofier but equally hard-hitting 
and worthwhile combo, opens all the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 10,000 Maniacs and Camper Van Beethoven play rock Friday at 8 p.m. at the 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Tickets: $20.50 
and $22.50 (plus $5 for parking). Information: (714) 855-6111.

FOR THIS YOUNG MUSICIAN, THE SAX IS A HORN OF PLENTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has all happened quickly for Eric Marienthal. At 30, the Costa Mesa resident 
and member of keyboardist Chick Corea's band has established himself as one of 
the hottest young saxophonists on the contemporary jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
Things started breaking Marienthal's way in early 1987 after he met Corea while 
playing in Los Angeles with another keyboardist, John Novello. "We were playing 
every Monday night in a club called One for L.A. that was right down the street 
from the Baked Potato," Marienthal said. 
</P>
<P>
"One Monday night I came in, and there's Chick sitting there. I was nervous 
when I got up to the mike and started playing, but it went great. He stayed for 
the second set and actually came up and sat in. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple days later I got a call from his manager, who said they were just 
about to start Chick's 'Light Years' album and that they'd been considering 
adding a saxophone to the record and asked if I'd like to be the guy. I was 
completely overwhelmed. It was a dream phone call." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long after "Light Years" was recorded that Marienthal was approached 
by Dave Grusin of GRP, who had heard him with Corea and wanted Marienthal to 
record his own records for his label. He's made two records so far for GRP: 
"Round Trip," released this year, has reached No. 4 on the Cashbox jazz chart; 
"Voices of the Heart" was released the year before. Marienthal is also now a 
regular member of keyboardist David Benoit's traveling unit. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County jazz fans have had the chance to hear Marienthal for a long time. 
He has been playing at the Studio Cafe on the Balboa Peninsula Wednesday nights 
intermittently for six years, and he continues to do so when his travel 
schedule allows. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest thing about that gig is that it's a very rare opportunity to play 
straight-ahead jazz," he said. "We don't play fusion or anything off my 
records. We play stuff from the '50s and '60s, sometimes more modern, but still 
in that straight-ahead bag. There're very few places around that let me play 
that kind of music." 
</P>
<P>
And if that's not enough to keep him busy, he also periodically appears with 
his own fusion group. In fact, they will be performing a free lunchtime show 
Wednesday at Park Place in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
On "Voices," Marienthal played alto on tunes that seemed designed to capitalize 
on fellow saxophonist David Sanborn's popularity. "Round Trip," on which he 
also plays soprano, is a more involved effort.

"The second album is jazz music that has a lot of R&amp;B influence. I think 
it's a harmonically adventurous record; it's not a typical fusion record. It's 
got a lot of interesting things on it compositionally, a little more diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's done really well on the radio. It's not a weird record or anything too 
far out." 
</P>
<P>
Is it difficult to balance the types of music that he plays with Corea and 
Benoit with his own direction? "No," he said. "When I was coming up in high 
school, we listened to Cannonball Adderley, Art Pepper, Charlie Parker, 
Coltrane and, later, fusion as it became more popular and I became more 
interested in that kind of stuff. But I think the roots of most jazz music, 
like fusion, come from studying be-bop. You get a real grasp of just how to 
improvise, and it's a real base for playing most kinds of improvisational 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"So that's what I really enjoy. I enjoy fusion too, and I don't think there's a 
huge difference. The difference is in the way you interpret the music, not so 
much the way the music is created." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his solo work and his jobs with the Corea and Benoit groups, 
Marienthal, who is married and has two small children, is also a fixture on the 
Los Angeles studio scene. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of my income comes from doing TV jingles," he said. "I really 
enjoy doing studio work. Though I'm going more in the direction of doing solo 
work, I find the studio is really a challenge. I get to play other instruments 
with different musicians and on different kinds of music." Marienthal also 
plays flute, clarinet and piccolo as well as the tenor, alto and soprano 
saxophones. 
</P>
<P>
"If things go well in my solo career, I imagine that it will cut into my other 
work. But I don't perceive myself trying to get out of the session scene." 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious what Marienthal considers to be his real priority. "If I'm not 
working, then I'm daddying." Indeed, he was holding his 6-week-old son during 
the phone interview. "It can be pretty brutal when I'm traveling and not at 
home. Even when I'm home, I'm not around much. I'll get up early with the kids 
and spend some quality time with them before driving to the studio. Or if I'm 
working at night, then I have the day. If I'm working both day and night, then 
I have to bite the bullet. But I definitely consider parenting the main thing 
in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Marienthal and his fusion unit will play at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday at Park 
Place, 3333 Michelson Drive, Irvine. The concert is free. Information: (714) 
553-1220.

<P>
The partially clad body of an unidentified man who was apparently stabbed to 
death overnight was found this morning in a parking lot of a small Santa Ana 
grocery store, Santa Ana police said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the man, described as a Caucasian in his 30s, was discovered by a 
local resident at 6:30 a.m. as he was driving through the rear parking lot of 
the Santa Ana Food Market at 2133 South Main St., Santa Ana police spokeswoman 
Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Multiple stab wounds appears to be the cause of death," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said investigators were unable to immediately identify the man, who may 
have been a transient. Police officers arriving at the scene were unable to 
find the man's pants and wallet, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said it was not known if the man died at the scene or was taken there 
later.

The Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel under Mulholland Drive will be shut down from 
Aug. 19 to Sept. 30 so that the roadway can be reconstructed, two Los Angeles 
city councilmen announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude said the closure is expected to 
cause additional congestion on the San Diego Freeway and other highways linking 
the San Fernando Valley with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Transportation officials said the roadway must be 
lowered. They said past resurfacing has raised the street to a point that tall 
vehicles have begun to scrape the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said complete closure of Sepulveda between Rimerton Road and 
Royal Hills Drive is needed to ensure public safety.

STATE APPROVES RADICAL PLAN TO CLEAN THE AIR

A radical 20-year plan designed to cure the nation's worst smog problem via 
sweeping changes in the way Southern Californians live and work was unanimously 
approved today by state air quality regulators. 
</P>
<P>
On an 8-0 vote, the state's Air Resources Board adopted the 1989 Air Quality 
Management Plan for the smog-plagued region, encompassing the counties of Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never be able to clear the skies of this basin unless we are willing 
to innovate and change," ARB Chairwoman Jan Sharpless said. "While no plan is 
perfect, (this one) represents an innovative and necessary step forward." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by local smog regulators in March, will be forwarded to the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, although many of its provisions, 
especially those dealing with vehicles emissions, do not require federal 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has been five years in the making and is required by the federal Clean 
Air Act.

COUNCIL OKS GRAFFITI ORDINANCE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance today that would allow city 
workers to remove graffiti from private property with the owner's consent at 
city expense -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
The council's 14-0 vote sent the ordinance to the mayor, who has 10 days to 
sign the measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
If a property owner should refuse permission and fail to remove the graffiti on 
his own, the city could do the job and charge the owner for the work. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is a revision of a measure considered last week that would have 
cited owners with a misdemeanor for not complying. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance means that if someone complains about graffiti on a privately 
owned building, the city will contact the owner and ask permission to remove it 
at city expense. If the owner refuses, the city will give him 15 days to remove 
the graffiti on his own. If it remains after 15 days, the city will remove it 
without consent and place a lien on the property.

POLISH LEADER CALLS MEETING TO END CRISIS;

SOLIDARITY WILLING TO FORM GOVERNMENT WITH COMMUNISTS

<P>
President Wojciech Jaruzelski called today for an urgent meeting to end 
Poland's political deadlock, and the Solidarity opposition said it was ready to 
form a government with Communist participation. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski said he wanted all Poland's main political groups to meet as soon as 
possible and break the crisis that flared Monday when Prime Minister Czeslaw 
Kiszczak gave up his efforts to create a Communist-led administration. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa softened his previous terms for entering a 
coalition government by saying the opposition would accept a deal that allowed 
the Communist Party to keep the defense and interior ministries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Concern in Moscow 
</P>
<P>
"The most important ministries which are the base of the physical continuity of 
the state should stay in the hands of the Communist Party," Walesa told 
reporters at his home in the Baltic port of Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's statement sought to ease rising concern in Moscow over Poland's 
crisis. The Soviet newspaper Pravda, in its first attack on Walesa in the 
current turmoil, criticized him Monday for refusing to join a Communist-led 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said Solidarity had no intention of taking Poland out of the Soviet-led 
Warsaw Pact military alliance. He said the opposition wanted to run economic 
ministries in order to implement reforms of which the Communists were 
incapable. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak, the first Eastern European Communist leader to declare that he could 
not form a government, said Monday he was handing the task to Roman Malinowski, 
leader of the United Peasants' Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obedient Allies 
</P>
<P>
The UPP and the Democratic Party are two small parties that have been obedient 
allies of the Communists since the 1940s. In the current climate of rapid 
reform, they have made clear they want a more independent role. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa called last week for a wholly non-Communist government uniting 
Solidarity with the UPP and the Democratic Party. But Solidarity sources said 
the union's main concern had been to stop Kiszczak from installing his own team 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak was unacceptable to Solidarity because, as a former interior minister, 
he was Jaruzelski's right-hand man in 1981 when the authorities imposed martial 
law and interned thousands of union activists. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal being hammered out by Solidarity and the non-Communist parties, 
the opposition would nominate a prime minister and the UPP would have the 
foreign ministry, with the Communists taking care of Polish-Soviet security 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Power Brokers 
</P>
<P>
The UPP and the Democratic Party have become important power brokers because 
they have 22% of Parliament's seats. Neither the Communists, with 38%, nor 
Solidarity, with 35%, can form a majority without their support. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said he did not want to become prime minister. But "if society wants it, 
I must do it. I would prefer to have someone else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Walesa named Tadeusz Fiszbach, a Communist reformer who 
is deputy speaker in Parliament, as one party leader whom Solidarity could 
accept as a partner in government. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity and other non-Communist politicians said the crisis looked certain 
to continue because Malinowski, a deputy prime minister under martial law, was 
scarcely more acceptable to the opposition than Kiszczak.

A judge who berated a Legal Aid lawyer as a "liar" and warned a city attorney 
that there would be no food or sex in his courtroom exhibited "undignified" 
conduct, a state panel found today. 
</P>
<P>
The state Commission on Judicial Conduct recommended that Brooklyn Civil Court 
Judge Carmelo Tavormina be admonished for his treatment of lawyers in a 
Brooklyn courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, the judge lashed out at a city attorney for reading a 
newspaper in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
After the woman apologized, the judge said her response was "not good enough 
for me," threatened to have her placed in handcuffs and ordered her from the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
As the city lawyer left, the judge "twice stated in a loud voice that there was 
no newspaper reading, food or sex in the courtroom," she said.

Fewer than one in three jobless workers received unemployment insurance in an 
average month last year, tying the lowest rate ever recorded, a private 
research group said today. 
</P>
<P>
The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which calculated the 
figures from Labor Department data, called the low extent of coverage an 
ominous indicator of what might happen if the economy weakens further. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 6.7 million workers unemployed in an average month in 1988, only 2.1 
million of them -- 31.5% -- were getting benefits, the center said. That was 
the same percentage as in 1987 and the sixth straight year that the proportion 
receiving assistance has not improved.

Masked rioters hurling gasoline bombs and rocks clashed with riot police in the 
streets of Londonderry today, the 20th anniversary of the deployment of British 
troops in the city. Officers arrested an Irish-American activist. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Galvin, a New York lawyer and publicity director of the Irish Northern 
Aid Committee, was accused of violating a ban on entering British territory. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the group collects money to buy arms for the outlawed Irish 
Republican Army, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland. 
Galvin said the money is for families of victims of the province's violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the British police force, said three hours of 
predawn violence occurred in the city's Roman Catholic Bogside area, where two 
decades ago crowds barricaded streets in battles with police. 
</P>
<P>
Police fired dozens of plastic bullets to disperse rioters, who wore masks to 
hide their identities from authorities. Two men were hit but were not believed 
to be seriously hurt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The British domestic news agency Press Assn. said that at one stage gunshots 
were heard, apparently fired at police, and that officers were later reported 
to have fired in the air to scare off the rioters. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a local resident as saying rioters ran down a street 
throwing gasoline bombs and rocks: "This is the worst (violence) we have had 
for four to five years. People were expecting trouble, but no one knew what." 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic violence was also reported in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin, 39, was bundled into a police jeep and driven away after taking a 
well-publicized walk through Londonderry. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in London said Galvin will be flown to the 
British mainland and handed over to immigration officials. The spokeswoman said 
Galvin is expected to be deported. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin has visited the province at least four times since 1984 despite being 
ordered by Britain to stay out.

Authorities today recovered the bodies of all 16 people killed in the crash of 
a plane carrying a U.S. congressional delegation headed by Rep. Mickey Leland

A helicopter hovered near the face of a sheer cliff in southwestern Ethiopia as 
the bodies were hoisted up one by one from the rugged mountainside where the 
twin-engine plane crashed last week. 
</P>
<P>
They were flown to the nearby town of Gambela and placed aboard an Ethiopian 
air force C-130 cargo plane for the return to Addis Ababa.

The effort to retrieve the bodies of Leland, who headed the House Select

Scientists have concluded that a kerosene-based chemical Exxon Corp. concocted 
to remove oil from Alaskan beaches doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
A review committee determined that Corexit 9580MS generally is harmless to 
marine life but is of little value in lifting oil from rocky shorelines. 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Monday that the 
substance will not be approved for use on crude oil spilled when the Exxon 
Valdez ran onto a reef in Prince William Sound on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
The review committee, made up of representatives from state and federal 
agencies involved in the cleanup, has looked at hundreds of chemicals and 
cleanup techniques but so far hasn't found anything better than the 
high-pressure washing that is becoming less effective as the oil weathers and 
hardens.

CHRYSLER TO HIKE PRICE OF '90 MODELS 5%, BLAMES HALF OF RISE ON AIR BAGS

<P>
Chrysler Corp. said today that tentative prices for its 1990 cars will increase 
an average of 5% over comparably equipped 1989 models. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the boost is caused by the installation of driver-side air bags in 
all of Chrysler's U.S.-made cars, expected to be about 1 million vehicles in 
the 1990 model year, spokeswoman Karen Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the average air bag will cost the consumer $450, less than what 
Chrysler pays to buy and install them. She refused to say exactly what the auto 
maker is spending on the systems. The rest of Chrysler's price increase stems 
from economic reasons, including higher material and labor costs, she said.

Arnold Ale, listed as a possible starter on the defensive line for defending 
national football champion Notre Dame, has dropped out of the university, a 
spokesman said today. "He left for personal reasons," said Jim Daves of the 
university's athletic department. "I think we was a little homesick and wants 
to get back to the West Coast." A 6-foot-4, 211-pound sophomore from Carson, 
Calif., Ale had reported for fall practice and was competing for a spot at 
defensive end.

Three Texas A&amp;M football players, including running back Darren Lewis, 
sustained minor injuries during an attack they said occurred at a Bryan park. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis suffered a minor cut on his left hand during the Sunday night attack but 
was able to take part in practice Monday, the Bryan-College Station Eagle 
reported today. Sophomore linebacker Quentin Coryatt, who was stabbed in the 
chest and was treated and released from St. Joseph Hospital, is expected to 
miss a few days of practice. Freshman linebacker Jason Medlock, who was cut on 
the left arm, also was able to practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Aggie Coach R. C. Slocum said the players were injured while trying to get away 
from a group that attacked them. "From all I gather, it was a case of some guys 
being jealous of the football players," Slocum said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they have no suspects in the case.

AGNOS HITS CRITICS OF BALLPARK PLAN

Mayor Art Agnos angrily blasted critics of a new downtown ballpark during a 
debate over the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Slamming his prepared notes against a chair as he paced in front of the 
audience Monday night, Agnos accused opponents of hurting the future of the 
city. "I'm tired of this attitude where we say we are going to take this fight 
to every precinct and every neighborhood," Agnos said about a vow by critics to 
block the ballot proposal with a grass-roots campaign. "What we are talking 
about is the future of San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Agnos' remarks came before members of the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian/Gay 
Democratic Club. The audience sat silently as Agnos blasted critics of the 
$115-million China Basin ballpark proposal he put together. Gay votes are 
considered vital for passage of the fall ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said the new ballpark would be just as cold and windy as Candlestick, 
would block bay views and would turn out to be costlier than current estimates.

BUSH AGREES WITH DARMAN CALL FOR FED TO CUT INTEREST RATES 
</P>

<P>
President Bush said today that he agrees with comments by Budget Director 
Richard Darman suggesting that the Federal Reserve is jeopardizing economic 
growth by holding interest ratestoo high. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought his comments were very balanced. I can feel very comfortable with 
his sallying forth and saying that," Bush said at a White House news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any President, now or in the past, who doesn't favor lower 
interest rates," Bush said in answer to a question about the unusually critical 
remarks by Darman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Privately Critical 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have been privately critical of the Fed's interest 
rate policies, but they have avoided publicly criticizing the independent 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
On a conciliatory note Bush added, "You also have to be concerned about 
inflationary pressures." 
</P>
<P>
Darman said in a television interview Sunday that the Fed, which until recently 
had been pushing up interest rates to slow growth and bring inflation under 
control, would be to blame if the economy falters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fearful that they may have been a little bit too concerned that things 
have been going well and that they may have been a little bit too tight," 
Darman said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do have a recession, I think it will be because they erred on the side 
of caution," Darman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would take under advisement a reporter's question on Darman's 
remarks about blaming the Fed, saying he did not recall that aspect of his 
budget chief's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
He promised to let reporters know the answer to that question "at a later 
date." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve pushed rates up by a sharp three percentage points for a 
year beginning in March, 1988, to curb inflationary pressures in the economy, 
but the central bank has since eased credit on signs that growth has slowed 
down. 
</P>
<P>
In June, persuaded that inflation was no longer a pressing danger, the Fed 
reversed its credit tightening and eased the key federal funds rate, the 
interest banks charge one another for overnight loans, by about three-quarters 
of a point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution Planned 
</P>
<P>
Although the Fed is concerned about the risk of a possible recession, Chairman 
Alan Greenspan has told Congress that the central bank intends to act 
cautiously in lowering interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve influences the economy by controlling the money supply and 
interest rates. The central bank is independent from the Administration, and in 
the past there have been clashes between the two groups over interest rate 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists say public criticism of the Fed could backfire for the 
Administration because it might prompt the central bank to demonstrate its 
autonomy by keeping rates slightly firmer than it would otherwise.
