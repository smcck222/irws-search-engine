NEWSMAKERS: CLOTHES STILL MAKE THE MAN -- EVEN IF HE'S A BIG FISH

The best fish story of the summer so far comes from Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. 
Casey, who discovered he hadn't made as big a splash as he thought. In Hamlin, 
in Pennsylvania's rural Wayne County, the governor entered a small bait shop 
near Lake Ariel and tried to buy a fishing license. Dressed in fishing togs, 
the governor carried no wallet -- a state trooper chauffeuring him waited 
outside in the car. "Are you a Pennsylvania resident?" demanded the clerk. Yes. 
"You got a driver's license?" No. "A voter's card? Anything?" No. Finally the 
trooper came in and vouched for Casey. The clerk reluctantly issued the 
license, saying: "I'm going to make an exception in your case."

 -- Her stage name was Zippy. She has a Clio award for commercial work and an 
Emmy. She has appeared in a number of rock videos and visited David Letterman 
on his show. But now, at age 8 (40 to 50 in human years), Jade the chimpanzee 
is retiring. She arrived this week at a sanctuary near San Antonio, Primarily 
Primates Inc., a private facility that cares for aging animals that can no 
longer live among humans. "I thought she would be in a period of mourning," 
said Jade's owner, Beverly Krevens of New York, "but she immediately took to 
it. She started running and climbing all over."

 -- And a different kind of "animal house" is out, as far as one college 
fraternity is concerned. Zeta Beta Tau next month will be among national 
fraternities to eliminate hazing and ban fraternity funding for alcohol. "It's 
not easy to implement, it may be painful, but nevertheless it's an idea we felt 
should be followed through," said ZBT executive director James E. Greer Jr., a 
Class of '64 ZBT from Cal State Long Beach. The fraternity, with 5,000 members 
nationally, wants to eliminate heavy drinking, harassment of pledges and other 
activities reminiscent of the fraternity boys in the John Belushi film, "Animal 
House." "We've had letters and phone calls from alumni, calling this a break 
with tradition, saying they don't understand," Greer said. "But overall it's 
been more positive than negative." He added: "We're dealing with a smarter, 
more savvy freshman." TOM DURKIN

Former Black Panther Party leader Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt was denied parole for 
the ninth time since the 1968 murder of a Southern California woman during a 
$30 robbery. Board of Prison Terms Commissioner David Brown announced after the 
hour-long hearing at San Quentin Prison that Pratt, 41, serving a life 
sentence, "is not suitable for parole at this time." Brown, who characterized 
the murder as "heinous and despicable," said the prisoner had consistently 
refused vocational training and a crucial psychological evaluation. Pratt was 
convicted in the murder of Carolyn Olson, 27, a schoolteacher, who was shot to 
death during the robbery.

HAROLD P. LEVY; EXPERT ON PUBLIC RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold P. Levy, veteran public relations professional and writer, has died of 
pancreatic cancer at a Pasadena convalescent home, his family announced 
Thursday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Trinidad, Colo., on March 8, 1907, Levy grew up in Seattle, graduated 
from the University of Washington, and spent five years as a reporter for the 
Seattle Times. He moved to New York City in 1934 at the height of the 
Depression and began handling public relations and research for social welfare 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Levy wrote four books based on that work -- "A Study in Public Relations," 
"Building a Popular Movement," "Public Relations for Social Agencies," and the 
autobiographical "There Were Days Like That." 
</P>
<P>
"One hint of meaningful change is a new, calmer response on my part to what in 
earlier days were manifest freeway driving irritations," Levy wrote in a column 
about aging for the Los Angeles Times shortly after his retirement at the age 
of 80. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Alice Klund Levy of Glendale, three nieces and a 
nephew.

FINEST CITY WEEK BEGINS SATURDAY WITH PARK PICNIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a home states picnic in the park to an ice cream social on the water, it's 
time for every San Diegan, native and transplanted, to revel in his or her 
residency. This Saturday marks the beginning of America's Finest City Week. 
</P>
<P>
AFC Week, something of a nine-day, citywide block party, is presented by the 
Junior Chamber of Commerce in celebration of San Diego. U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
created the event when he was mayor in 1972 after San Diego lost the bid for 
the National Republican Convention. The mayor's office had organized the event 
every year until 1982, when the Junior Chamber took over. 
</P>
<P>
The following events are scheduled from Saturday through Aug. 27: 
</P>
<P>
* AUG. 19: The Home States Picnic -- Representatives from all 50 states will 
exhibit traditional items and sell food from their respective regions from 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. at 6th Avenue and Laurel Street in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
* AUG. 20: AFC Week Half-Marathon -- More than 5,000 runners will participate 
in the 12th annual race, beginning at 7 a.m. at Cabrillo National Monument in 
Point Loma and finishing in Balboa Park. High school cheerleaders, comedians, 
magicians and belly dancers will entertain runners along the route. 
</P>
<P>
* AUG. 23: AFC Jazz Bash -- KIFM radio and Omni Hotel are co-hosts to this 
concert featuring saxophonist Richard Elliott and keyboard player Steve Bach, 
beginning with happy-hour festivities at 5:30 p.m. at the Omni Hotel, 910 
Broadway Circle. Tickets are $4.98 each and may be purchased through 
TicketMaster outlets. To charge by phone, call 278-TIXS. 
</P>
<P>
* AUG. 25: Beach Ball -- From 6 p.m. to midnight, the Catamaran Resort Hotel 
will look like something out of "Beach Blanket Bingo," complete with palm 
trees, sand and a limbo contest. Tickets are $15 in advance and $20 at the 
door. The dance is sponsored by Y-95 radio and the Junior Chamber of Commerce, 
and all proceeds will benefit the American Lung Assn., the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation and the Assn. for Retarded Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
* AUG. 26: Kids' Day at The Bay -- Chuck E. Cheese will preside over this 
bayside extravaganza, featuring Hula Hoop contests, bean bag tosses, clowns, 
jugglers and mimes, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Bonita Cove in Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
* AUG. 27: Ice Cream Social -- The event, sponsored by Baskin Robbins, takes 
place from 2 to 5 p.m. at Seaport Village. Ice cream games, with prize 
giveaways, are scheduled.

VAIL LAKE FIRE WAS SET BY ARSONIST, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vail Lake blaze that charred more than 15,000 acres of the Cleveland 
National Forest earlier this month was set by an arsonist, a U. S. Forest 
Service official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had blamed target shooters for the fire that raged through Riverside 
and East San Diego counties from July 29 to Aug. 11, briefly endangering the 
Palomar Mountain Observatory. But investigators have known for more than two 
weeks that the fire was the work of an arsonist, said Tommy LaNier, special 
agent in charge at the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators reached that conclusion Aug. 2, when they found a small 
device used to set the fire near its point of origin, LaNier said. Until then, 
the blaze had prevented investigators from searching the site thoroughly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents withheld the new information from other Forest Service personnel because 
they feared disclosure would jeopardize their investigation, according to 
LaNier. After Aug. 2, Forest Service spokesmen continued to suggest target 
shooting as the likeliest cause of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questioning Target Shooters 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to talk to some people, and in order for us to work on that 
investigation, we did not want to reveal" the conclusion of arson, LaNier said. 
"We just said that the target shooters were responsible, and that may still be 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to say the Forest Service has suspects, LaNier noted that 
his men are questioning target shooters who were at the site when the fire 
started. 
</P>
<P>
LaNier also declined to describe the incendiary device, saying only that "it 
was a little bit more complex" than an arsonist's weapon of choice -- matches. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service first disclosed its conclusions at a briefing for local 
residents Tuesday on the progress of the cleanup, according to LaNier. Since 
then, he said, he has received several tips from people who believe they saw a 
suspicious vehicle near the Dripping Springs Campground, where the fire 
started. 
</P>
<P>
The arsonist who started the blaze would face federal arson charges, which 
carry a maximum five-year prison sentence. The arsonist would also be billed 
for the $8-million cost of fighting the fire, LaNier said. About 2,800 
firefighters from California and elsewhere battled the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people go to jail for smaller fires than this," LaNier said.

<P>
A three-alarm brush fire set by an arsonist caused minor damage to two San 
Diego homes Thursday, a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 11:43 a.m. fire on a canyon side between Interstate 805 and Vancouver 
Street was started with a device used by other roadside arsonists in the past 
year, said the spokesman, Jon McDonald. McDonald declined to describe the 
device. 
</P>
<P>
The small blaze raced up from the shoulder of the interstate toward the two 
homes in the 3400 and 3500 blocks of Vancouver Street, according to McDonald. 
Thick vegetation around the homes, left uncut in violation of the city's fire 
code, contributed to the damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire consumed the outdoor deck of one home and flung embers onto the roof 
of another. There were no reported injuries, and damage was estimated at 
$7,000. The flames burned less than an acre of brush, McDonald said.

Hundreds of Pacific Bell strikers turned out early Thursday to picket in front 
of the Pacific Bell office at 525 B St. to protest the death of a New York 
striker who was run over while walking a picket line earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Communications Workers of America, Local 9509, wore black 
armbands in memory of the victim. Local union leaders said a striking worker 
was slightly injured Wednesday when she was bumped by a pickup truck entering 
the telephone company's plant on Arizona Street. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Local 9509 official, the unidentified woman was struck by a 
truck driven by the husband of a worker who crossed the picket line. She was 
taken to a local hospital, where she was treated and released, said the 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell officials acknowledged that a confrontation occurred, but they 
questioned whether the woman was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike has entered its second week. Locally, negotiations have 
stalled over medical benefits. The union has rejected a company offer to shift 
some of the health coverage costs to the employees.

STATE CONCURS THAT PORT MUST SHARE POLLUTION COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State water authorities decided Thursday to uphold a local board's decision 
finding the San Diego Unified Port District equally responsible for cleanup 
costs incurred when a Port District tenant dumped copper into San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the state Water Resources Control Board, on a 3-2 vote, means the 
Port District will share liability with Paco Terminals for cleaning up 
pollutants in the bay. The state action upheld a unanimous decision in February 
by the Regional Water Quality Control Board to add the Port District as a 
responsible party in the cleanup of the harbor, said Frances McChesney, the 
state agency's staff counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup costs could run into the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The two dissenters in the state board's decision wanted to hold the Port 
District secondarily responsible for the bay pollution, which would have 
required the Port to pick up cleanup costs only if Paco Terminals was unable to 
do so, McChesney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sophisticated' Landlord 
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the Port District equally liable was based on arguments 
that the Port District knew what Paco Terminals was discharging into the bay, 
McChesney said. The state board has held the landlord equally responsible in 
similar cases, she said, adding that the Port District was a "sophisticated 
type of landlord." 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there were things that they could do as a landlord to prevent the 
discharge or control the discharge," McChesney said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision was assailed by Port Commissioner Dan Larsen. "I think it's 
ridiculous to hold the port responsible for what a tenant does," Larsen said. 
"I think any landlord would feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Port Commissioners will meet with its attorneys in a closed-door 
meeting Tuesday to discuss whether to pursue the issue in Superior Court, 
Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Route Exhausted 
</P>
<P>
The appeal route to state water authorities has been exhausted, McChesney said. 
The state decision does not resolve the specific allocation of the costs. Those 
questions might also have to be decided through civil litigation, McChesney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them to decide, either privately or in court," McChesney said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach officials of Paco Terminals were unsuccessful. The company, 
which loads and unloads ships, was fined last year by the regional board, which 
enforces state and federal water laws in the San Diego area, for dumping copper 
into the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The fine stemmed from the company's failure to comply with a 1985 cleanup and 
abatement order by the regional board. The copper contamination occurred when 
Paco Terminals loaded copper ore at the 24th Street Terminal.

ALASKAN CHILL CHASES AWAY HOT, HUMID DOG DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is not normal, this business of cool temperatures and low humidity in 
August. Do not let your relatives visiting from Back East be fooled into 
thinking this is San Diego's standard, mid-summer paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures struggling to reach the upper 70s and 59% humidity will make for 
an exceptionally nice August weekend, said National Weather Service forecaster 
Wilbur Shigehara. Normally, the humidity for this time of year is 66% and 
coastal and inland areas are sweltering under 90-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
"People can stop wondering if the weather is always this nice in San Diego in 
the middle of August," Shigehara said. "It's not." 
</P>
<P>
"This extremely dry and unusually cool weather is courtesy of a cold front from 
the Gulf of Alaska stalled over the Southland," Shigehara said. "Associated 
with it is an upper-level low-pressure system along the West Coast. All this 
adds up to weather more like May and June than mid-August." 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said the weather will remain pleasant and sunny through the weekend. 
Hurricane Henrietta, about 1,300 miles southwest of San Diego, will bring 
occasional high clouds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tides Are Rising 
</P>
<P>
While the humidity and temperatures are down, the high tides are up. Tuesday 
night, the high tide was 6.9 feet, and Wednesday it was 7.1 feet, Shigehara 
said. No damage was reported at local beaches, and the tide will subside to 
near 6 feet by tonight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is at 3 feet, and the ocean water temperature is 70. The beaches will 
be a little breezy, with winds blowing 10 to 17 m.p.h., Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the winds and the low humidity, there will be a lot of ventilation that 
cleans out the air pretty good," Shigehara said. "This is a wonderful thing for 
the middle of summer." 
</P>
<P>
Daytime highs at the beaches are expected to be from 68 to 73 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
After the mid-morning clouds burn off, it will be sunny and pleasant along the 
coast, Shigehara said. Highs will range from 73 to 78 degrees, and lows will be 
between 63 and 68. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs of 78 to 87 degrees are forecast through Sunday, with overnight 
lows a chilly 56 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains, high temperatures will struggle to reach the low-80s, and the 
nights will dip into the mid-40s, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The desert will have partly cloudy skies today, and highs will range from 102 
to 108 through Sunday. Overnight lows will be in the mid-70s. 
</P>
<P>
The more typical, humid, dog-day weather of August is not expected to return to 
San Diego until the middle of next week, Shigehara said.

ABORTION AND 'NEUTRAL' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have the right to choose between alternatives that are . . . morally 
permissible," writes Philip A. Lacovara in his defense of the Supreme Court's 
decision on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
My judgment is that my morals are just fine without Mr. Lacovara's bias. 
Further, in comparing a woman's decision to abort her pregnancy with her 
decision to have a nose job or a breast implant, Mr. Lacovara reveals 
sensitivity exceeded only by his chauvinism. Would he also compare a man's 
choosing to become a father (or not to become one) with his opting for a hair 
transplant? 
</P>
<P>
I prefer that my state reps don't decide any of my medical, cosmetic, or 
ethical choices for me!

AND NOW IT'S THE SENATE'S TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next Thursday, the Judiciary Committee of the state Senate will have the 
opportunity to demonstrate whether its regard for the public's safety outweighs 
its fear of the gun lobby's vindictive bully boys. On that day, the committee 
will consider 14 firearms regulation bills already passed by the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
If the senators can summon up the courage this occasion demands -- and which 
the other chamber already has displayed -- California will take another step 
toward enacting the United States' first comprehensive system of rational 
firearms regulation. As such, it would constitute a national example of how a 
legislative body can, in fact, strike an appropriate balance between the 
public's right to walk its streets in safety and the legitimate interests of 
real sportsmen. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the bills to be heard simply would increase the penalties for various 
existing firearms offenses. Like other such measures, they have a certain 
cathartic value and make showy citations in their sponsors' campaign 
literature. There is, however, little evidence to show they are of much 
practical benefit. Four of the proposals, on the other hand, are desperately 
needed, and deserve quick and decisive approval. 
</P>
<P>
For example, AB 497, which was introduced by Democrat Lloyd G. Connelly of 
Sacramento, would extend the 15-day wait between the purchase of a handgun and 
its delivery to all sales of all firearms. That two-week period would allow the 
Department of Justice to ensure that the prospective buyer is not a person 
prohibited from owning a gun under the bill. These would include individuals 
found mentally infirm under law, convicted felons, those found guilty of 
certain violent misdemeanors within the previous 10 years and persons 
prohibited from possessing a weapon as a condition of probation. AB 497 is 
supported by every major law enforcement agency in the state, and Gov. George 
Deukmejian has indicated he will sign it. The Judiciary Committee should help 
give him the opportunity to do so. 
</P>
<P>
It also should do its part to send him AB 1680, written by Democrat Rusty 
Areias of Los Banos. He proposes that anyone purchasing a concealable weapon be 
required to complete a simple 2-hour course in basic firearms safety. In a 
little more than a decade, the number of California households possessing a 
handgun has doubled to 2.5 million. Given this explosive growth, the need to 
enact Areias' common sense measure is clear. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the dictates of simple reason demand passage of two bills by 
Democrat Johan Klehs of Castro Valley. His measures are vital complements to 
the ban on military-style assault weapons enacted earlier this year. One would 
prohibit the sale of detachable magazines with a capacity of more than 10 
rounds. The other would proscribe so-called multiburst trigger activators and 
military-style shotguns with rotary or detachable magazines capable of holding 
more than five shells. 
</P>
<P>
No serious sportsman has any use for such guns; thugs, lunatics, murderers of 
schoolchildren and killers of police officers can't do without them. The issue 
is joined. The Senate need only declare whose side it's on.

HIGH DRUG COSTS AND MEDICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Fortney H. Stark (D-Oakland) would like to see Americans receive a "fair 
deal" for their Medicare dollar. We agree. Too bad he didn't extend the same 
deal to EPOGEN and its manufacturer, Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
In his Aug. 2 column, "A Miracle Drug for Some but a Tax Drain for All," Stark 
charges that Amgen will reap untold profits from Medicare for its drug EPOGEN, 
a revolutionary treatment for the anemia suffered by kidney dialysis patients. 
We cannot understand why Stark is vilifying EPOGEN, which he, along with 
leading nephrologists, calls "a miracle drug." 
</P>
<P>
First, Stark appears to confuse revenues with profits. It is true that industry 
analysts projected annual revenues exceeding $100 million for this product. Not 
all of that money will reach Amgen, of course, because other manufacturers 
expect to enter the market soon. Stark's estimate for the cost of EPOGEN is 
less than the cost of packaging this breakthrough product. More importantly, 
Amgen's revenues will be spent largely on research and development. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Amgen ranks first of all American companies in the amount it spends on 
research and development both per employee and as a percent of revenue, 
according to a recent survey in Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Stark knows that Amgen didn't "extort" anything from anyone. Medicare 
didn't roll over and play dead. Representatives from the Health Care Financing 
Administration (HCFA) and the company participated in spirited discussions that 
lasted nearly a year. In the end HCFA established a reimbursement rate the 
government found to be equitable. (The U.S. price for EPOGEN is more than 30% 
less than in Europe.) 
</P>
<P>
Third, Stark implies that EPOGEN is not more valuable than gold. A gram of 
EPOGEN can provide a week's worth of treatment for 8,000 patients and eliminate 
1,000 blood transfusions. Does that make EPOGEN better than pure gold? We say 
yes, as do dialysis patients. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen is just as concerned as Stark about the rising cost of health care. That 
is why we presented all of this information to his staff and to Sen. David 
Pryor (D-Ark.) at his hearings on drug pricing. That is why we worked closely 
with HCFA. It is difficult to understand Stark's alarm, and to fathom why he 
feels a need to belittle the company and the achievement of making EPOGEN a 
reality.

ABORTION AND 'NEUTRAL' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading two news stories about parents being accused of killing their 
small children and another about a 15-year-old girl arrested for abandoning her 
newborn at a construction site (Aug. 12), I again began wondering when our 
"enlightened" society would begin promoting adoption as a better means of 
dealing with unwanted children. I began reading Philip A. Lacovara's article 
with a sense of relief. 
</P>
<P>
As an attorney, I could see that his arguments had been well-thought-out and 
researched and, after all, adoption was mentioned as an alternative means of 
dealing with unwanted pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
However, when I reached his arguments that fathers should have a right to stop 
abortions and that the government should have a right to restrict abortions for 
the poor, it was clear that he was reaching. Both arguments were supported with 
ridiculous comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was clear that yet another man is, consciously or not, trying to 
justify the creation of a growing underclass of single welfare mothers raising 
children they did not want to raise, unable to fulfill their own dreams, or to 
provide a life of opportunity for their children. 
</P>
<P>
Even pro-choice activists cannot justify the use of abortion as birth control, 
nor can pro-life activists justify forcing all women with unwanted pregnancies 
to spend their lives paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
Only when all of us can come together to spend our money and time to promote 
the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, and to promote the positive aspects of 
adoption as an alternative, will we be assured that abortion is used as a last 
resort only. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that we are unwilling to do that prevents us from calling ourselves a 
truly human nation.

LATE FILINGS FILL ALL SCHOOL DISTRICT RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late filings for school board races in seven South Bay school districts added 
seven candidates to an already-large field and ensured that every district will 
be able to fill vacant seats in the Nov. 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
Filing was extended until Wednesday in districts where incumbents had not filed 
for reelection by the close of the regular filing period Aug. 11. Those are the 
Lawndale, Wiseburn, Manhattan Beach City and Hermosa Beach City elementary 
school districts; the South Bay Union High School District, and the Palos 
Verdes Unified and El Segundo Unified school districts. 
</P>
<P>
As of the initial filing deadline on Aug. 11, the Manhattan Beach City School 
District had only two candidates for three seats. That was remedied this week 
when two more contenders, Bernard E. O'Connor Jr. and Ronald G. Durham, filed 
papers with the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder. They will face 
incumbents Gary R. Collins and Rosa Lee Saikley. 
</P>
<P>
The late filing period also produced two more candidates in the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District race, which is expected to focus on the 
secession efforts of residents who live on the east side of the district. 
Brenton F. Goodrich and Brigitte Scheuegraf added their names to the list of 
contenders seeking three vacancies on the board. Both favor a single district, 
as do Jeffrey Younggren and Marlys Kinnell, the incumbents seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The secession fight was sparked two years ago when the board voted to close 
Miraleste, the east side's high school. Candidates who have favored secession 
or a guarantee to keep Miraleste open, are Peter Gardiner, Barry Hildebrand and 
Marianne Kipper. Scheuegraf has said she favors keeping Miraleste open but is 
opposed to secession. 
</P>
<P>
In other additions to the lineup, Gerald L. Wellfonder and Martha Castillo del 
Muro filed for the board of the El Segundo Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The race for four board seats already included incumbents Timothy T. Chang and 
Ruth Parks, along with Jim Butterworth, Rich Reed, Ken Schofield, Patricia 
Walker, Jerry Walters, Nancy Wernick and Keith Wise. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer, Chang last month was ordered disbarred by the state Supreme Court for 
misappropriating money from a client. The court found he had "misappropriated 
over $7,000" from Mellon Bank of Philadelphia. The bank hired Chang in 1983 to 
collect $78,983 owed it, but he kept more than $7,000 for himself as a fee, 
according to the Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bank Filed Complaint 
</P>
<P>
The bank disputed the fee and filed a complaint in 1984 with the State Bar of 
California. The State Bar recommended Chang's disbarment. On July 27, the state 
Supreme Court agreed, finding that, in addition to the misappropriation of 
funds, he had "fraudulently delayed the State Bar's investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Chang could not be reached for comment this week. The disbarment takes effect 
Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Also filing this week was Gregory J. Kelsey, who is a candidate for one of 
three vacancies on the Hermosa Beach City School District. The other candidates 
are incumbents Mary Lou Weiss and Lynne Gonzales, as well as Bill Druar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No New Candidates 
</P>
<P>
No additional candidates turned in papers for the Lawndale, Wiseburn and South 
Bay Union High School districts, where filing had also been extended. 
</P>
<P>
Following are candidates in school races that did not gain candidates this 
week: 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Bonnie Coronada and Robert Kruse and challenger Thomas Wayne Garrett 
for three seats on the Lawndale School District board; 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Walter Guerrero and Daniel Juarez with challenger Angelina Garza for 
three seats on the Wiseburn School District board; 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Tom Downs and Lyn Florey, plus Jim Duffy for three South Bay Union 
High School District. 
</P>
<P>
In a race not related to schools, Teresa Sun became a candidate this week for 
the Palos Verdes Library District, where filing was also extended because an 
incumbent did not seek reelection. Previously filing for the two vacancies on 
Palos Verdes library board were incumbent Janet Smith, Frances Bolton and Alex 
Rennie.

LIKELY SALE SPURS TORRANCE AUDIT OF CABLE TV FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted unanimously this week to audit Paragon 
Communications, which provides cable television service for about 54,000 homes 
in five South Bay cities. 
</P>
<P>
Under Federal Communication Commission rules, it is likely that Paragon will be 
sold as a result of the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. City 
officials said they want information on the company's finances so that they can 
negotiate a franchise agreement with a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
Without discussion, the council voted Tuesday to pay the Sherman Oaks 
accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand $15,000 for the audit. Ken Flewellyn, 
Torrance's assistant financial director, said he does not know how long the 
audit will take to complete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Interested 
</P>
<P>
The city has not previously audited Paragon, which took over the cable TV 
franchise from Group W Cable in 1987, he said. The audit would also "make sure 
we are receiving our fair share" of the company's revenues, Flewellyn said. 
</P>
<P>
Paragon has franchise agreements with Torrance, Gardena, Lawndale, Hawthorne 
and El Segundo. Officials in the five cities are interested in the possible 
sale because their franchise agreements with Paragon require the cities to 
approve any change in ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the FCC will probably require the sale 
because otherwise Time Warner Inc. would control both Paragon and KCOP-TV in 
Los Angeles, which serves most of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Time now owns 82% of American Television and Communications, which owns 50% of 
Paragon. Warner owns 42% of BHC Inc., which owns KCOP. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC prohibits a company from holding more than 5% of the stock in both a 
cable system and a television station in the same market, agency officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett Brick, a lawyer for the FCC in Washington, said the agency has granted 
Time Warner Inc. until January, 1991, to come into compliance with the 
regulation. He said Time Warner Inc. can sell KCOP to comply with FCC rules, 
but he said the company will most likely sell Paragon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Opposed to Audit 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Ramsey, vice president of Paragon Communications, said he is not opposed 
to an audit but hopes the auditors can avoid disrupting the company's work 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
While officials in the other South Bay cities have yet to take action similar 
to Torrance's, in the past they have said they would be watching the merger 
because the sale of Paragon would permit them to renegotiate their franchise 
agreements with the new cable company. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Reeves, Hawthorne's chief of special services, said that if Paragon is 
sold, the city could negotiate a new agreement that would include improvements 
to the cable system. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said Torrance's audit of Paragon is "a prudent thing to do." Hawthorne 
has not asked for an audit of Paragon but may do so soon, he said. "I think it 
might be a good thing for all the cities to do."

TORRANCE AIRPORT TAKES FLAK FOR RENOVATION PROJECT THAT IS FORCING OLDER 
BUSINESSES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Keeney is an old-timer at Torrance Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
A 78-year-old pilot and businessman, Keeney has operated Acme Aircraft Co. at 
the airport since 1945. In its early years the company occupied 2 1/2 acres, 
employed about 50 workers and provided maintenance and fuel service for dozens 
of aircraft each week. 
</P>
<P>
But time and the city's redevelopment plans for the airport have closed in on 
Keeney. 
</P>
<P>
Now he works by himself out of a small, single-story, white stucco building 
hidden within a row of new city-built hangars. The only service he offers is 
weighing planes so that pilots can meet federal certification standards. 
</P>
<P>
When Keeney's lease on his original site expired several years ago, the city 
built hangars on most of that land and sold Keeney a five-year lease to the 
tiny lot from which he now works. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told to Move 
</P>
<P>
About a year and a half ago, his lease to that lot expired, and the city told 
him to move out to make room for two more city hangars. 
</P>
<P>
The hangars -- 72 of which already have been built -- are part of the city's 
airport redevelopment project, which also will include a 9,681-square-foot 
General Aviation Center and two or three large aviation-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In order to stay at the airport, the city told Keeney he must either build 
himself a new facility or incorporate his operations with another airport 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But Keeney says he can't afford to relocate or build a new facility. 
</P>
<P>
He said many of his friends have told him to give up his business and retire. 
But he said he knows no other life outside of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell am I going to do, pull the cork?" he said, referring to 
retirement. "What am I going to do, go home and mow the lawn?" 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment project that is forcing Keeney out of businesses is at the 
center of a debate between city officials and some business operators at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the city say the project will breathe new life into the 
airport and draw aviation-related companies to build businesses there. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Raber, the airport's program specialist, said the city does not want to 
run Keeney and other airport companies out of business. But most of the 
airport's buildings are dilapidated, he said, and if airport business owners 
are unable to renovate or build facilities, the city will lease their land to a 
company that will. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get rid of the old stuff and put up the new stuff. . . . The 
whole intention is to renovate the airport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Owners Pessimistic 
</P>
<P>
But several business owners at the airport are pessimistic about the project, 
which they say will drive away longtime operators who cannot afford new 
facilities but do little to attract new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to do a damn bit of difference," said Bob Hamilton, owner of G 
&amp; S Industries, an aircraft repair shop he has operated at the airport for 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton and some other airport business owners say the airport will continue 
to struggle because the city has created a climate that discourages pilots from 
using the Torrance facility. 
</P>
<P>
As examples, they cite the city's restrictions on aircraft noise, its ban on 
the sale of jet fuel and limits on the number of tie-down spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Raber said the city has implemented such restrictions in order to curtail the 
noise that spills into adjoining neighborhoods, and he said city officials 
believe it is possible to have a viable airport and continue to enforce such 
noise-limiting restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, however, the project met with disappointment when only one firm 
responded after the city contacted dozens of aviation companies throughout 
Southern California, asking them to submit proposals for constructing new 
aviation-related businesses at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Ng, the assistant city manager, said the city has since extended the 
deadline indefinitely and sought more proposals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Needs a Face Lift' 
</P>
<P>
Ng said he thinks it has been difficult to attract proposals because "the 
airport needs a face lift." Many buildings at the airport were built during 
World War II and are now dilapidated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hamilton contends that the city's own short-term lease policies have helped 
to foster that dilapidation. Without the security of longer leases, he said, 
business owners have no incentive to maintain or modernize their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ng said that almost all businesses at the airport are on a month-to-month lease 
because the city wants to be able to take over a lease on short notice to make 
room for a new business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of bids, Ng said the city is still optimistic about the 
project, but Hamilton said he believes applicants may be discouraged by the 
city's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Hamilton said he did not submit a proposal to build a new facility 
at the airport because he could not afford to pay both the nonrefundable 
$25,000 deposit and the cost of constructing a new building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Unusual 
</P>
<P>
Ng said the deposit, which would be returned after a lease is signed, is 
required to make sure the developer goes through with its plans. He said such a 
deposit is not unusual for redevelopment projects in Torrance and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Bodell, manager and part-owner of Nagel Aircraft Co., an aircraft parts 
supplier, said that his company is going out of business this month because its 
30-year lease expired in June and he also could not afford to build new a 
facility. He said another factor in his decision was the city's insistence on 
limiting him to a one-year renewal on his lease. 
</P>
<P>
Bodell said that would make it difficult for him to maintain the huge inventory 
his shop requires. He said that when he buys an aircraft for salvage, it takes 
at least two years before he sees a profit from selling the parts. 
</P>
<P>
"In our type of business you just can't run for one year at a time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bodell said that he will auction off his inventory this weekend and prepare for 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wilcox, a Torrance homeowner and pilot for 20 years, agrees that the 
airport needs renovations. But he said that if city officials continue limiting 
airport operations, they should consider giving airport businesses financial 
aid to help them modernize their buildings or build new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The airport's businesses "can't afford to maintain their buildings, pay rent 
and renovate," he said. "The city is going to have to make some 
considerations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15 Companies 
</P>
<P>
But Raber said the city does not have the money to help airport businesses 
build new facilities. He said each company must pay for its own maintenance and 
renovation cost. "That's just part of business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 15 companies doing business at Torrance airport. Acme Aircraft Co. 
and Nagel Aircraft Co. are the only companies going out of business to make way 
for the redevelopment project, Raber said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the project, the city will build a new $1.5-million General Aviation 
Center next to the airport control tower. It will house the airport's 
administration offices, operations center, a flight planning office, a noise 
monitoring center, a pilot's lounge and a community meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already spent about $1.5 million for the hangars and is renting 
them out for $300, $400 and $1,000 a month, depending on their size. Over the 
next 30 years the city expects to make about $7 million from the hangars. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the hangars and the general aviation center -- which should be 
completed within two years -- is coming from the airport budget and the sale of 
a bond, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the new aviation-related businesses will cost its owner between $1.5 
million and $2 million to build. They will be located on a 10-acre vacant 
parcel just west of the airport control tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cure for Problems 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials are pitching the redevelopment project as a cure for 
many of the airport's problems, nearby residents, pilots and business owners at 
the airport still express concern about the airport's finances. 
</P>
<P>
The airport, which was once a World War II flight training center for the Army 
Air Corps, totals about 500 acres. About 140 acres are leased for 
non-aeronautical uses, such as shopping centers and auto dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the aeronautical operations of the airport have lost a total of 
about $2.5 million, according to past city budget reports. However, revenues 
from commercial leases regularly put the total airport budget in the black. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a "dramatic reduction" in the number of flights at the airport, 
said Raber, who attributes most of the reduction to a decline in general 
aviation throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, when the airport was at its busiest, there were about 439,000 
departures and landings. Last year, there were about 249,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noise Control 
</P>
<P>
However, Raber acknowledged that the city also limits operations at the airport 
as a means of controlling noise. He said the airport has enough tie-down space 
for about 1,050 airplanes, but the city has limited that number to 825, by 
allowing some tie-downs to remain unused. Depending on the size of the 
aircraft, the airport receives between $80 and $125 per month for a tie-down. 
</P>
<P>
Eli Alexander, manager of ALEXAIR, which rents and services helicopters at the 
airport, said he thinks the airport would attract more businesses if the city 
eased up on its noise and aircraft restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said that increasing the number of airplanes at the airport will not 
necessarily increase noise because many pilots only fly once or twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
"They are like yachts," he said. "People won't use them every day." 
</P>
<P>
According to Raber, the airport has a ban on 39 types of aircraft -- mostly 
older jets that violate the airport's noise limits. No other airport in the 
area, including the Long Beach, Hawthorne and Santa Monica municipal airports, 
has such a ban, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we are kind of unique," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airport Curfew 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the city passed an ordinance that limits aircraft noise to 82 decibels 
-- equivalent to the sound of a vacuum cleaner operating in a closed room. 
</P>
<P>
The airport also has a curfew between 11 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. Only emergency 
flights and pilots with exemptions can fly in and out of the airport during 
those hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although airport business operators claim that Torrance's noise restrictions 
are the most drastic in the area, Raber said it is difficult to compare the 
noise restrictions at Torrance with those at other airports. 
</P>
<P>
He said different airports limit noise in different ways. Some airports are 
larger and farther away from populated areas and therefore have fewer 
restrictions, he said. "It's like comparing apples and oranges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Monica Airport, where residents have often complained about noise, 
airport Director Hank Dittmar said the maximum allowable noise level is 95 
decibels. Santa Monica also has a list of 22 restricted aircraft that are 
allowed to operate there only if pilots can demonstrate that they can land or 
take off without violating the noise limit, Dittmar said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica also enforces a ban on takeoffs and landings after 11 p.m. and 
before 7 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Limits, Bans 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Hawthorne Municipal Airport has no noise limits and no banned 
aircraft, according to Robert Trimborn, the airport's administrator. He said 
the city only asks that pilots not practice takeoffs and landings after 10 p.m. 
and before 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The city gets very few noise complaints from residents, he said, and most 
pilots voluntarily try to limit airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the concerns of business owners at the Torrance airport, Raber said 
city officials are unlikely to ease restrictions on noise and operations there. 
</P>
<P>
That is bad news for Keeney, who is reluctantly packing his equipment and 
preparing to move out of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Keeney mourns having to leave his friends and the life he has known for 44 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 78 years old," he said. "I'm not going to be here forever. . . . I just 
want to hang on a little longer."

REDONDO WANTS COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER CITY MUST REBUILD THE PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council has called off official debate over the future 
of the damaged Redondo Pier until a court determines whether the city has a 
legal obligation to rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gordon Phillips, who recommended the legal route, said a ruling 
could be issued in three to four months and would cover a number of related 
issues, such as the design and size of a new or rebuilt structure -- if the 
court finds that the city must restore the pier. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the pier was destroyed by ocean storms and a fire last year. The 
council voted in November to rebuild, but that decision soon faltered in the 
face of vocal opposition from some residents. They demanded a referendum on the 
issue, while others at numerous public hearings urged the council to proceed 
with the project. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Thursday expressed relief over prospects of another 
jurisdiction resolving the contentious and increasingly complex pier question. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the smartest and safest way to get the issue settled and avoid litigation 
in the future," said Councilman Stevan Colin. "We had the cart before the 
horse, but now I think we're back on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
He and other officials noted that city political campaigns earlier this year 
were a factor in delaying council decisions on rebuilding the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips and City Manager Tim Casey said the idea of calling on the courts was 
prompted by a council decision Aug. 1 to hire a consultant to draw up various 
design plans before deciding whether to call a referendum on the pier's future. 
</P>
<P>
However, that approach "ignores one basic legal question that remains 
unresolved and raises several more," Casey told the council Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Phillips, in August, 1988, offered his opinion that the city 
had no legal obligation to restore the destroyed portion of the pier, while 
lawyers for the leaseholder, Pier Properties, said it did. 
</P>
<P>
"Without resolving this conflict now," Casey said, "the city may be developing 
planning options, raising public expectations and seeking voter commitment to 
one or more project designs that could be legally invalidated at a later date." 
</P>
<P>
Other questions the court will be asked to answer, Casey said, include whether 
the city can construct a public building on a new pier, whether a new pier 
would have to be exactly the same shape and design as the structure destroyed 
last year, and whether Pier Properties would have any rights if the city 
chooses to build a pier whose boundaries would lie wholly or partly outside the 
present leasehold. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Robinson, a general partner in Pier Properties, said he will also welcome a 
court resolution of the legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I have agreed that it's the best way to go," he said. "Let's get squared away 
in language that people understand." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's lease, which covers the destroyed portion of the pier, was obtained 
from the city in 1962 and runs for another 40 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said he would file the city's request for declaratory relief in 
Torrance Superior Court. In such an action, the court is asked to interpret 
legal issues and questions arising from them.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ENERGY CONSERVATION PRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood this week received kudos from a state commission for saving energy by 
installing a cost-cutting new cooling system at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Others need to pay attention to Inglewood," said Stephen M. Rhoads, executive 
director of the California Energy Commission. He told city officials that 
Inglewood is a leader among California cities in energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Thermal Energy Storage Cooling System, which cost $453,000, was 
dedicated Tuesday, though it began operating in early June. Expected to save 
the city more than $100,000 a year, it was bought with a $400,000 loan from the 
California Energy Commission and an $85,000 grant from Southern California 
Edison Co., city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized cooling system consists of a 144-ton low-temperature 
refrigeration plant, a pumping plant and a 1600-ton-per-hour ice bank. During 
off-peak hours, it manufactures ice that is used later to chill water to 
air-condition the building. It will save money by shifting 428 kilowatts of 
daily electricity use to the night, when demand and utility rates are lower, 
officials said.

SANTIAGO FIT TO TRAVEL; PADRES WIN; 
</P>
<P>
CATCHER CLEARS WAIVERS, CAN BE DEALT UNTIL AUG. 31

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On what should have been a momentous and joyous occasion Thursday, Padre 
pitcher Bruce Hurst instead found himself in the middle of a controversy of 
which he wanted no part. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst won the 100th game of his big-league career, 6-2, over the New York Mets 
in front of 40,406 at Shea Stadium. But little did he realize the debate his 
performance would trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it appeared safe to presume that catcher Benito Santiago would be 
remaining with the Padres, it's now anyone's guess whether he'll return in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jack McKeon revealed before the game that the Padres have not only 
requested waivers on Santiago, but that he has cleared them, making him 
eligible to be traded to any major league club before Aug. 31, when playoff 
rosters are frozen. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will continue to dangle Sandy Alomar Jr., now in triple-A, in front 
of contenders in need of a front-line catcher. But McKeon said that if a team 
wants one for the pennant race, it will likely seek Santiago, not Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a pennant contender," McKeon said, "I'd want Santiago. I wouldn't 
take a chance on a kid. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not going to give up Santiago for three or four young prospects, I'll 
tell you that right now. That's why I don't think anything will get done. Maybe 
in the winter, but not now. 
</P>
<P>
"Hypothetically, would the Mets trade us (Juan) Samuel and (Sid) Fernandez for 
Santiago? No, not right now. Would the Astros trade us (Ken) Caminiti and 
Gerald Young for Santiago? No, not right now. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in the winter, they'll make that offer, but not now." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, who is in the market for a young shortstop, a center fielder and a 
starting pitcher, could possibly fill one of those positions by trading Alomar, 
perhaps two by trading Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows what will happen, maybe it'll be Alomar going, he's the best in the 
minors," he said. "The thing is, he (Alomar) could have been a real bargain for 
somebody last winter. They could have gotten a pretty good deal. But now, it's 
going to cost them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supply and demand, and I've got the supply. If you want them, come and 
get them. It just depends on who wants to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbus took a chance and discovered America." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also are realizing more and more that it would be less of a risk 
trading away Santiago than they originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Santiago is an All-Star who very well might be the best in the league 
right now. But when the ace of your pitching staff struggles with Santiago 
behind the plate and thrives with backup Mark Parent, it raises your curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was Parent catching once again with Hurst (12-9) on the mound Thursday, 
marking the third consecutive time he has caught Hurst, the fourth time in five 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon calls it a coincidence. Santiago is not so sure. Hurst refuses to get 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference when Parent, and not Santiago, is behind the plate in 
Hurst's starts is quite clear: 
</P>
<P>
Hurst is 5-2 with a 1.90 ERA in eight starts with Parent. He has thrown four 
complete games, and the one no-decision occurred when he pitched 10 shutout 
innings against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst is 7-7 with a 3.54 ERA in 18 starts with Santiago as catcher. He has had 
four complete games with four no-decisions. 
</P>
<P>
So Bruce, just who would you rather have in the lineup when you're pitching? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not getting in the middle of this," Hurst said. "I don't make up the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
While Hurst sidestepped the issue, Santiago stepped into full view, saying that 
he's becoming rather annoyed by the implication. He says he understands when 
he's provided an occasional day off but he doesn't think it fair that Parent 
should be Hurst's personal catcher. Most of all, he said, he'd just like to be 
told once and for all that he'll remain a Padre, not read rumors every day 
where he's going next. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired of all this stuff," said Santiago, who is hitting .239 with 
six homers and 41 RBIs. "They don't know what they're going to do. I'm tired of 
having my name in the papers every day. They leave me hanging." 
</P>
<P>
Parent, on the other hand, would gladly trade places with Santiago but 
realistically knows that he's destined to be a backup. He's sure that 
eventually either Santiago or Alomar will be traded, but the only effect it'll 
have upon him , he says, is that he would receive additional playing time if 
Alomar were the catcher who was kept. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to be close going into September," Parent said, "I'm pretty 
positive I'll be catching a decent amount, to see if we can win this thing. But 
if we go into September ei ght or nine (games) back, I'm sure I'll be warming 
up guys in the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said that Alomar, who already has more than 90 RBIs, will join the 
Padres sometime in September. If the Padres still are in the pennant race, it's 
logical to assume that Alomar will play only sporadically. If they're out of 
it, expect him to play almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be great just to have him up here," said Roberto Alomar, Sandy's younger 
brother, who obtained the second four-hit game of his career Thursday. "The 
best thing would be if we could play together on the Padres with my dad (third 
base coach Sandy Sr.) here." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (60-61) would like to put all trade talk behind them for now and 
just concentrate on getting into the pennant race. And when they have games 
such as Thursday's, they believe there's no reason why they should be left 
behind in August. 
</P>
<P>
With just two batters in their lineup having faced Met pitcher Frank Viola 
(traded three weeks ago from the Minnesota Twins) the Padres greeted him 
rudely. They pounded out four runs and five hits in the first inning en route 
to their biggest offensive performance of the season against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
It might not have looked pretty at times, with the Padres finding every 
conceivable hole in the first two innings, but the runs all counted the same. 
</P>
<P>
"We used our short-yardage offense," said McKeon, whose team had just one 
extra-base hit (a double) among their 13. "We hit them like he threw: nice and 
soft." 
</P>
<P>
So even though Hurst allowed 10 baserunners in the first four innings, with his 
early 5-2 lead, the only real trouble he ran into occurred in the fourth, when 
Howard Johnson stepped to the plate with two on. Pat Dobson, the pitching 
coach, came out and said to feed Johnson outside fastballs, preventing him from 
pulling the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson swung at the first fastball he saw, popping up to first baseman Carmelo 
Martinez, and the Mets' final threat was over. They never again reached second 
base the rest of the game, managing just three singles as Hurst pitched his 
eighth complete game of the season.

HE HATES DECISIONS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT EX-ST. BERNARD STAR DECIDED TO PLAY PRO BALL, WAIT ON COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRYL LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Decisions are hard for her son, Royce Clayton's mom will tell you. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was 3, I would ask him, 'Do you want bacon and eggs or bacon and 
pancakes?' It would drive him nuts. He hates to make decisions" 
</P>
<P>
But the good side of facing a choice is having one, and certainly there have 
been many choices to make concerning the future of Royal and Antoinette 
Clayton's youngest son. 
</P>
<P>
Royce, a St. Bernard High baseball star and California prep Player of the Year, 
signed with the San Francisco Giants after graduation in 1988. The Giants 
cashed in their first-round pick -- 15th overall -- for the shortstop who had 
led the Vikings to three straight CIF playoff stints. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton's caliber of play was never questioned; the Baltimore Orioles were so 
high on him that they were set on using their pick, fourth in the entire draft, 
on Clayton until a prize pitcher became available. 
</P>
<P>
But first Clayton had to wrestle with a big decision. Also beckoning for his 
baseball services were several major colleges, including USC, who were offering 
full scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton chose to temporarily shelve the college education to pursue his 
lifelong dream of playing pro ball. He played rookie ball last year and spent 
the first part of this season in Class A Clinton, Iowa, before being promoted 
to the Giants' top Class A club in San Jose on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
He and his family have no regrets in taking the baseball path more often 
traveled by promising prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I make the right decision?" Clayton asks, repeating a question he's been 
asked many times. "It all depends on how you look at it. This (pro baseball) is 
my college right here, for now, anyway. I've learned a lot of things outside of 
baseball in the minors. As far as a business decision goes, it was the best 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
And career-wise it may not have hurt him either, since the Claytons are still 
planning on Royce working his way toward a degree in the off-season. A student 
with a B average at St. Bernard, Clayton's academic standing was more than 
suited for a university. His parents helped ensure a quality education by 
enrolling both Royce and older brother Royal in private schools throughout 
their youth, with the payoff to be a pair of college-educated sons. 
</P>
<P>
Royal took the prescribed route and graduated with a degree in psychology from 
UC-Riverside after three years at Arizona State. A fine college pitcher, Royal 
is hurling in for Class AA Albany-Colonie in the New York Yankees system. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at sports this way," says Royal, the father. "No matter how good you 
get, you need to have the complete package, with an education, to fulfill 
yourself. We live in a society today where education determines your income." 
</P>
<P>
The youngest, Clayton is well aware of the rewards of college, and only the 
opportunity afforded to a first-round draft choice was enough to put them on 
hold. Clayton admits his selection slot, and not just playing, had everything 
to do with his plunge into the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I was taken as high as the second round, I wouldn't have done it 
(signed a pro contract). I would have probably gone to USC," the 19-year-old 
said. "But I went in the first round, the financial situation was great and the 
Giants are a great organization." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco has agreed to help Clayton obtain the education he has put off. 
At Royce's father's insistence, the club wrote an educational stipend into his 
son's contract. The team will shell out $12,000 to any university Clayton picks 
to work on his degree. He's leaning more toward attending UCLA for off-season 
study than USC -- his original choice out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, former St. Bernard teammate Tim Williams is entering his third 
season -- and junior year -- at Loyola Marymount, playing center field for 
Coach Chris Smith's Lions. 
</P>
<P>
There's a definite reason, says Williams, for Clayton's smooth transition to 
pro ball at such a young age: 
</P>
<P>
"He's very mature for his age. His head's on straight. He won't let his offense 
affect his defense. He'll go 0-for-4 and still play good in the field. And he's 
a really good ball player." 
</P>
<P>
Williams concedes that the outlook a pro team gives a high school prospect will 
play a huge role in choosing between college and the minor leagues. Selected 
29th in the draft out of high school in 1987, Williams said he never seriously 
considered signing because of his low selection. 
</P>
<P>
But for Clayton, being a high pick helped in his decision more than he thought. 
"There would have been a lot more pressure if I had gone to college being a No. 
1 pick. No. 1 picks are supposed to tear up college," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the process has started slowly, Clayton hopes to someday tear up the 
pros. He was batting under .200 overall when he left Clinton but helped his 
early season slump by hitting over .310 during June and July. His main talent, 
though, is fielding. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it. Any team would need my kind of defense." 
</P>
<P>
Says Bob Yarnall, Clayton's high school coach: "That's his main strength, his 
fielding.When he walks out to take the field, you can ask anybody watching who 
they think the best player appears to be, and they would probably pick out 
Royce. He really has himself composed and plays that way too." 
</P>
<P>
If he keeps it up, it will make a lot easier his decision -- the one that drew 
mixed reviews from his family -- to take up pro baseball now and to hit the 
books during the off-season later. 
</P>
<P>
And about those dreaded breakfast decisions as a child? Says mom Clayton: "He 
would say 'Both,' and I would tell him, 'No, you can't have both, you have to 
make a choice,' " 
</P>
<P>
Concerning pro baseball and a college education, the son has made a choice, and 
it is to do both.

retired -- toured Australia and Taiwan last month. Jabbar and Westhead have 
remained friends since Westhead was replaced as Lakers' coach in 1981, so 
Westhead was pleased to be invited to coach the team, which included Artis 
Gilmore and George Gervin. 
</P>
<P>
Jabbar, of course, recently completed a 20-year NBA career. His final season 
included retirement ceremonies in every NBA city. The NBA's all-time scoring 
leader is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world. 
</P>
<P>
At most stops on the Pacific trip, Westhead said, the team was introduced, then 
Kareem made a grand entrance. "It was kind of an exciting finale to be with 
Kareem. He was very well received," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the contests were in Australia, the last game was in Taipei, 
where the plan was for Kareem to hit a last shot late in the game, then 
Westhead would call a timeout and allow Jabbar to make a dramatic exit. "Here, 
in college or the pros, you can engineer that. But we were playing 
international rules, where you can't call timeout unless there's a dead ball," 
Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
So, late in the game, the ball was passed in to Kareem, but he passed off. 
Moments later, he had another chance but missed the shot. 
</P>
<P>
With about a minute left, Westhead said, "He made the classic turnaround 
skyhook. We couldn't call timeout but all of us on the bench went onto the 
court and stopped the game. We weren't supposed to be able to do that but 
nobody minded at that point. 
</P>
<P>
"This was to be his last game, maybe for all time. Kareem made a nice kind of 
tour of the court, shaking hands with fans along the side. I think he just 
intended to do that with the people sitting there, but it was like everyone in 
the stands took that as a signal and all the people in Taiwan came down to the 
court. It was like the Pied Piper. So he made his final skyhook." 
</P>
<P>
The international timeout rule, which bars timeouts for substitutions, made for 
some tired ballplayers on the trip, Westhead said. "You could only play these 
guys five or six minutes, then they'd give me a signal, like 'Take me out.' 
Then, 'Please take me out!' And on the bench, 'We can't take you out.' We had 
to wait for a dead ball." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran team obviously couldn't play an all-out Loyola style, but Westhead 
said that, curiously, the team still played better in a running attack. "Even 
with their aged legs they performed better in the faster-paced games," he 
noted. "The Australian team, which plays very methodical, hurt our team the 
most at a slower pace." 
</P>
<P>
Lions on the Move: There have been several coaching and administrative changes 
in the Loyola athletic department. In men's soccer, Peter Novak has been named 
coach. The 1982 graduate of Adelphi University in New York, who also coaches 
the women's team, will be assisted by Jay Simon, a Loyola graduate. Bob Riley 
has been named assistant volleyball coach. Riley, who has been a high school 
coach in Honolulu for several years, joins the staff of Mike Normand, who is 
beginning his first season with the Loyola women's team. Mike Sheehan, a 1985 
graduate of Loyola, has been named coach of the men's and women's cross-country 
teams. Sheehan, a veteran of 24 marathons, including Boston, New York and Los 
Angeles, teaches at Daniel Murphy High School, where he is also track and field 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
On the administrative side, Bruce Woods, who has been a graduate assistant 
coach in men's basketball for the last two years, has been named assistant to 
the athletic director. The 1986 graduate of Wheeling College in West Virginia 
will work under Athletic Director Brian Quinn and will continue to assist 
basketball coaches Paul Westhead and Todd Corman. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Andy Marafino, a 1989 graduate of Loyola, has been named assistant 
sports information director. The Connecticut native will oversee publicity for 
women's basketball, baseball and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
One of the West Coast Conference's prospective basketball stars, Osei Appiah, 
is out of the lineup at Santa Clara after transfer plans fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Appiah, a Long Beach Poly High graduate, was a three-year part-time starting 
guard at Santa Clara who averaged 9.1 points as a junior. In two games against 
Loyola he averaged 16. But after the school year he asked out of his commitment 
to Santa Clara and looked into transferring to an Ivy League school. 
</P>
<P>
When his transfer plans didn't materialize, Appiah asked Santa Clara Coach 
Carroll Williams to reinstate him. Williams is allowing Appiah to stay in 
school and complete his studies but declined to put him back on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a last-minute transfer, Appiah will apparently be a spectator for his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount guard Bo Kimble leads the Sonny Hill League in scoring at 33.8 
points per game in the latest stats from the Philadelphia-based summer 
basketball league, ranking just ahead of an upcoming Loyola opponent, LaSalle's 
Lionel Simmons at 33.3.

FOOTBALL CARRY-OVER HELPS BECK AS RACER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Brown 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so another girl played high school football. Another story about becoming 
one of the boys. Big laughs over locker-room arrangements. All the usual stuff. 
</P>
<P>
So what's so different about this one? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Katie Beck, who played football at Simi Valley High in her freshman and 
sophomore years, parlayed those experiences into cycling and, last week in the 
Junior National Championships in Colorado Springs, Colo., overcame numerous 
mechanical failures to place in the top 10 in five events. 
</P>
<P>
Beck, 16, started racing bikes about a year ago. She entered local races, 
advanced to statewide events and then graduated to the Junior Nationals as a 
track and road racer. 
</P>
<P>
None of which comes as a surprise to Dave Murphy, Simi Valley High's football 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great experience with her," Murphy said. "She has every coach on our 
staff's respect. She earned the guys' respect, also. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that she could succeed in a sport like cycling." 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. 
</P>
<P>
On a borrowed track bike, Beck was seventh in the two-kilometer pursuit final 
and the sprints final. On a borrowed road bike, she was ninth in the individual 
time trial, seventh in the road race and fifth in the criterium. This despite 
dropping her chain during the time trial, having a tire come off a rim in the 
road race and various crashes. 
</P>
<P>
"I crashed everywhere I went," said Beck, who is entering her junior year. "So 
it surprised me that I hung that well with them. I expected to be in 20th place 
-- or last." 
</P>
<P>
Beck's staying power can be linked to a degree to her time with the football 
team when she became familiar with the school's weight room. The 5-foot-5, 
135-pound Beck squat lifts 255 pounds and bench presses 135. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of weight training for football," she said, "and I think that made 
up the difference in my muscles in training for cycling." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was duly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"She does have great leg strength," he said. "She's extremely dedicated in the 
weight room. I gotta believe all the lifting helped her." 
</P>
<P>
Beck won't play football this fall but said that she will try water polo 
instead to further develop her cardiovascular fitness and aid in her cycling. 
Beck is aiming for the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't give up cycling for anything," she said. "It's the greatest. You 
get hooked on it." 
</P>
<P>
Add Junior Nationals: Haldane Morris of Sherman Oaks was the most successful of 
the Valley-area men last week. In the 17-18 men's division, he placed second in 
the three-kilometer pursuit final, fourth in the points-race final and fifth in 
the road race. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill's Shawn Cronkhite, in the same division, was 10th in the individual 
time trial and second in the criterium, and Ryan Murphy of Van Nuys was eighth 
in the 15-16 men's sprints final. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Ross, a Van Nuys resident in the 13-15 women's division, was seventh in 
the sprints final. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining Mo-mentum: Maureen (Mo) Manley of Thousand Oaks, a member of Team USA, 
left Thursday for Chambery, France, site of this year's World Cycling 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Manley qualified as part of the National Team's team time trial, along with 
Peggy Maass, Linda Brennemen and Betsy Davis. Manley is the only member of Team 
USA riding with the National Team. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility of Manley competing in the road race, but she's not 
counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really just shooting to shatter myself on the team time trial," she said. 
"I don't want to have enough left for the road race. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's time to go hard, I really go hard." 
</P>
<P>
The team time trial is scheduled for Wednesday, and the team will not return to 
Colorado Springs until a couple of days later. Manley, however, hasn't planned 
any sight-seeing trips through France. "The only thing I want to see is a gold 
medal around my neck," she said.

DIGEST: ALVARADO FOLLOWS LOFRANO AS COACH OF SCOUT TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manny Alvarado has replaced Bob Lofrano as coach of the Chicago Cubs scout 
team, but the Kennedy High baseball coach said that he has no plans to follow 
Lofrano at Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano resigned his position at Chatsworth this month to become an assistant 
coach and physical education teacher at Pierce College. Alvarado, who led 
Kennedy to the City Section 4-A Division championship in his first year, has no 
teaching assignment at the Granada Hills campus. He teaches physical education 
at Sepulveda Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not considering applying at Chatsworth because I've already developed 
loyalties at Kennedy," he said. "The people at Kennedy have been good to me and 
I'm willing to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Byrne, a recent magna cum laude graduate of Cal Lutheran and captain of 
the Kingsmen track team, has been named an academic All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne, an at-large, second-team All-American choice, qualified for the 1989 
NAIA championships in the steeplechase. He won the 1988 NAIA District 3 
steeplechase championship and finished third in the same event this year. He 
compiled a 3.77 grade-point average.

The Eastview Little League All Stars of San Pedro beat the Oregon All-Stars 1-0 
and reached the semifinals of the Western Regional Championships. Eastview, 
14-1, faces the Montana All-Stars today at 5:30. 
</P>
<P>
An overflow crowd of 9,000 at Al Houghton Stadium watched Eastview score its 
only run in the bottom half of the first inning. Leadoff hitter Angel Quintero 
walked and advanced all the way around the diamond on three passed balls by 
Oregon catcher Tom Potanm. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon pitcher Tony Combs struck out 11 batters and allowed only four hits. 
Eastview's Tim Harper, 5-0, struck out nine and allowed four hits. Harper did 
not allow an Oregon player to reach third base. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't reach Williamsport (World Series site in Pennsylvania) scoring runs 
on passed balls, but I was pleased with our defense tonight," Eastview Coach 
Joe DiLeva said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastview must win its next two games to reach the World Series. GREG GONZALEZ

DELUCA RALLIES TO BEAT SALAZAR, WIN NABF TITLE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he was knocked down once and left barely standing another time, San 
Diego's Tony (Bazooka) DeLuca landed enough telling punches to win a 12-round 
split decision over Willie Salazar Thursday night at the El Cortez Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, DeLuca claimed the North American Boxing Federation's 
flyweight title (108 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
One judge scored it 116-110 Salazar, while the other two gave it to DeLuca, 
117-111 and 115-112. 
</P>
<P>
DeLuca (16-2-1, six knockouts) had heavy swelling under both eyes beginning in 
the fifth round but began to find the range with his right hand in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar (35-15-1), of Guadalajara, Mexico, finished the fight with blood 
flowing from his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
After being knocked down in the eighth, DeLuca seemed to carry the last four 
rounds with his left hand, which he had virtually ignored previously. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar appeared to have a slight advantage in the first, which was basically a 
feeling out time for both fighters. DeLuca seemed to control the second, 
scoring with short, lead rights. Salazar went down early in the round, but the 
referee ruled it a slip. 
</P>
<P>
DeLuca landed two straight rights early in the third and appeared the carry a 
close round. After he was staggered in the fourth, DeLuca came back in the 
fifth, opening a cut over Salazar's left eye with a straight right hand. He 
followed with a number of right jabs to the cut. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth and seventh, DeLuca continued to pound away with right hands and 
appeared to carry both rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar dropped DeLuca in the eighth with a right hand that got over the 
challenger's lazy left. Although DeLuca came back with a couple of 
combinations, Salazar was a big winner in the round. 
</P>
<P>
In preliminary bouts, Jorge Rodriguez (164) of Los Angeles came down in weight, 
but it didn't seem to affect his stamina in an easy four-round unanimous 
decision over San Diego's Lee Lark (168). 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez (3-1) captured every round and dropped Lark (1-1) late in the fourth 
with a left-right combination. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the lopsided victory, Rodriguez was not completely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not that pleased," Rodriguez said. "I have to look to pinpoint my 
punches a little more. I had better stamina than I thought though." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was looking to fight again in a couple weeks, but a cut over his eye 
will force a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Amado Zavala (146) of La Mesa solved the awkward style of left-hander Carlos 
Gonzalez (146) to take a five-round unanimous decision in the third fight. 
Zavala (3-0) floored Gonzalez (7-4, five knockouts) in the first round and 
dominated all but the second. 
</P>
<P>
Zavala, 29, was hit below the belt on several occasions. Finally, in the fifth, 
a point was taken away from Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
"The last one took a lot of power out of me," Zavala said. "I was in control, 
but left-handers always seem to bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Rogelio Perez (123) of San Diego won a unanimous decision over San Diego's 
Sergio Alonzo (124 1/2), who was making his professional debut. Perez (3-1) put 
Alonzo down with a left hook in the second round and won all four rounds 
handily. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, the debut of San Diego 172-pounder Ray Harring lasted all of 
2:37 as he was knocked out by Roberto Servin (175).

A GOTHIC TALE OF MURDER IN RURAL AMERICA 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Story of Annie D. by Susan Taylor Chehak (Houghton Mifflin: $17.95; 206 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
Set in Nebraska farm country, told in prose as functional and straightforward 
as a silo, "The Story of Annie D." may represent a new subgenre -- the American 
rural Gothic. Smack dab in the Corn Belt, shriveled Wizen River may not seem to 
have much in common with the verdant English moors generally favored by writers 
of such tales, but as Annie D.'s autobiography unfolds by restrained 
indirection and ominous innuendo, a familiar pattern emerges. 
</P>
<P>
The child of a kindly, tenacious farmer and a discontented, ambitious mother 
who seized her first chance to escape her dreary life, Annie D. grew up 
crocheting doilies and conjugating Latin verbs, accomplishments her mother 
believed would guarantee a marriage more exciting than her own. Unfortunately, 
these city graces scared off the local boys, and Annie didn't marry until the 
advanced age of 27, when Dr. Diettermann, a German refugee, came to her for 
English lessons, and shortly thereafter proposed by sketching a man and woman 
in connubial embrace. 
</P>
<P>
Annie accepted, and Dr. D. stayed on to practice medicine in the neighborhood. 
Though theirs wasn't exactly a love match, Annie was secure and content. She 
and the doctor lived in town, raised two sons, and had no regrets. The Latin 
lessons had done the trick, not only gaining Annie a husband but supplying her 
with the subheadings that decorate each chapter in the novel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rambling Reminiscences 
</P>
<P>
For at least two-thirds of its modest length, "The Story of Annie D." seems 
merely an aging woman's rambling reminiscence about her girlhood, her 
satisfying life as Mrs. Diettermann, her ambivalent association with her dear 
friend Phoebe, and her impressions of other townspeople; none of the 
revelations particularly startling. Though there's the usual quota of village 
scandal and tragedy, mostly involving Phoebe's willful daughter Lacey, the days 
in Wizen River pass slowly, past and present all but indistinguishable from 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
While we know from the beginning that there's been a rape and murder in Wizen 
River's Center Park, the subject is dropped soon after it's mentioned, and the 
reader is encouraged to assume that it was committed by a drug-crazed transient 
who strayed far off course on his way to the coast. Though the chief of police 
is convinced that the victim must have known the killer since there was no 
outcry, the ensuing manhunt seems remarkably cursory. 
</P>
<P>
Our narrator sadly reports a second and third similar murder, each 
characterized by a bald patch on the victim's head where the killer has snipped 
away a lock of hair, but the focus of the book remains so firmly upon the 
minutiae of small-town life that the murders seem incidental -- merely a 
gruesome reminder that you're no longer safe even several hours by secondary 
road from Omaha, in a town with one cafe, a single movie, and bucolic Center 
Park; a place where everybody knows everyone else and a stranger would be as 
conspicuous as a giraffe. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, we learn that Annie's son, Gunar, was killed in Vietnam, and still 
later, discover that her younger boy, Bo, had survived a grisly suicide 
attempt. The reader might have been wondering about Bo, who works as a handy 
man in Center Park and seems not quite right in a number of respects, but the 
failed suicide apparently explains all that, and thus tranquilized, we let 
ourselves be persuaded that the murders were only the stimulus for Annie's 
memoirs of paradise lost. 
</P>
<P>
When Phoebe's profligate daughter, Lacey, returns to Wizen River with her 
illegitimate son after Phoebe's mysterious fatal automobile accident, the 
leisurely pace abruptly quickens, and long-withheld clues tumble pell-mell over 
one another. Annie D. is so expert at keeping secrets that it would be grossly 
unfair to tip her hand before she's ready to do so herself, but there's nothing 
wrong in telling you that these days, Wizen River is as perilous as Los 
Angeles, though still less smoggy.

DEPALMA'S DARK VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late '60s, TV coverage of the Vietnam War gave it the repetitiveness of 
a bad dream. That's probably what Brian DePalma is after in "Casualties of War" 
(citywide): a nightmare, reeking with blood, tears and cold sweat. 
</P>
<P>
Taken from a real-life incident, DePalma's movie turns into a battle epic with 
a screw loose. It conveys a sense of moral quagmire, of sinking into squishily 
dangerous terrain, honeycombed with tunnels and traps, all hell exploding 
around it. That's the imagery of the movie's first battle scene, a taut 
prologue for a superb film. 
</P>
<P>
DePalma may have found here the perfect arena for his darkly voluptuous 
expertise. Working with a David Rabe script that uses Daniel Lang's New Yorker 
reportage, he gets a bad-dream Vietnam. This isn't reality but hyper-reality: 
war as experienced in the oscillations between fatigue and terror, or recalled 
by someone fighting back the horror of his recollections. There's a moral 
charge to the action, but it's also swooningly exciting, coldly scary. Every 
friend may be an enemy, every innocent a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
Lang's book revolved around a brutally shocking 1966 incident in which the 
leader of a five-man reconnaissance squad, Sgt. Tony Meserve, informed his men 
that, before setting out on their mission, they would kidnap a Vietnamese farm 
girl, rape her en masse and then murder and dump her to cover their tracks. 
Astonishingly, all the men went along with this plan, except for one upright 
Minnesota farm boy, Sven Eriksson -- like the others, a fictitious name -- who 
refused to participate and later tried to bring his squad mates to justice. 
</P>
<P>
The horror of the premise soaks right into the movie's bones. In its scheme, 
everyone is a casualty of war: not only the poor, brutalized girl but the men 
themselves, turned by this hell into monsters or cowardly bystanders. The movie 
contrasts two temperaments: Eriksson's thoughtful reserve, Meserve's posturing 
bravado. And two styles of heroism: Meserve's undeniable bravery in battle, and 
the moral courage Eriksson needs to report the crime. The story becomes a 
battle between men who pervert the system to their own uses and others who, out 
of passionate conviction, try to buck it. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn, who play Eriksson and Meserve, respectively, have 
such dissimilar styles that, at times, they seem to be inhabiting different 
movies. Fox, in his best dramatic performance to date, has the laid-back, 
tamped-in, deferential quality of a skilled TV performer. Penn, on the other 
hand, bursts the boundaries of his role with his gargoyle intensity, his 
drilling gaze, his jaws perpetually chewing a plug of tobacco. Grabbing his 
crotch or waving his rifle, he's like a young kid's parody of a warrior: a 
macho paradigm. 
</P>
<P>
The whole Vietnam episode is part of a reverie -- Eriksson's -- triggered when 
he sees a woman who looks just like the victim Oahn (played by the same 
actress, Thuy Thu Le). Meserve's excesses seem part of that nightmare; so do 
the excesses of the rest of the cast. As the near-psychotic Clark, Don Harvey 
has a werewolf glower and an ominous mad-dog grim. John Reilly's Hatcher is a 
gangling, slack-jawed goof, Erik King's Brownie a florid clown and Ving Rhames' 
Lt. Reilly a coldblooded rationalist. 
</P>
<P>
"Casualties of War" is DePalma's 19th movie and easily his best. His detractors 
saw his Hitchcock-pastiche thrillers as manipulative and sadistic, but here 
he's not dealing with stylish slashers or bloody set-pieces. He doesn't have to 
reach for a shock. He's dredging up a deeper horror: the hell that lies beneath 
every man's skin, waiting to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a conflict here between DePalma and Rabe's temperaments -- Rabe is 
said to dislike the movie -- and, in a way, it's understandable. Rabe probably 
tried to make the nightmare real; DePalma turned it back into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
But that hallucinatory framework is what makes the movie uniquely his. The old 
virtuosity is there -- the murderously complicated long-take tracking shots, 
the macabre jokes at the edge of the frame, the deep-focus compositions. But 
they're buried in the story, they don't draw attention to themselves. And the 
themes and ideas are typical for DePalma too: the interplay of voyeurism and 
guilt, the heroine who can't escape, the linkage of violence and repressed or 
twisted sex, the obsession with a system's secret rot, with a nightmare taking 
over your life. 
</P>
<P>
"Casualties of War" questions the whole current movie idea of heroism in war: 
the blood-spattered boy's fantasies and one-against-a-hundred lollapaloozas of 
the '80s. Oddly enough, Meserve is more heroic and sympathetic in the movie 
than he was in Lang's book; he saves Eriksson's life and staunchly ministers to 
a dying black buddy (both fictitious episodes). We don't have the satisfaction 
of regarding Meserve as a coward, a hypocrite, a phony; he's a good soldier 
who's come to believe he has the right to rape and kill innocents. 
</P>
<P>
"Casualties of War" (MPAA-rated R for sex and violence) is no indictment of the 
American soldier -- indeed, Vietnam combat veterans may be among those most 
moved by it -- but it is an indictment of the idea that individual brutality 
can be cloaked by a system. For Eriksson, the horror of the episode was its 
anonymity; he refused to let the girl suffer and die for nothing. That's the 
bravest and finest part of the film, what all the people involved -- DePalma, 
Rabe, Penn, Fox, composer Ennio Morricone, cinematographer Stephen Burum, all 
of the cast and crew -- should be proudest of celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
The heroism of the real-life Eriksson lay not in revenge, but in his devotion 
to the victim. For all those who suffered or died anonymously in the juggernaut 
of the Vietnam War, or any war -- or the victims in their mass graves, the 
demonstrators shot down in a city square, the millions of bystanders caught and 
killed in the cross-fire -- the movie makes its lonely plea. The leitmotif 
Morricone uses for Oahn, the mournful pan flute that underscores her plight, 
comes back like an anguished cry, pushed up past breath, past hope, the last 
call of the suffering in a world in which death and horror are not only the 
province of the night.

STRING QUARTET IS COMPOSED OF WOMEN

Julie Rosenfeld and Deborah Redding, first and second violinists respectively 
of the Colorado String Quartet, embrace an unapologetic post-feminist outlook. 
It may be an indication that the Colorado Quartet -- the first all-female 
string quartet to play major league chamber music -- has come of age. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, when the unknown foursome won both the Naumburg Chamber Music Award 
and the Banff International String Quartet Competition, this quartet was an 
anomaly in the traditionally male-dominated world of the classical string 
quartet. Since then, other all-women quartets have joined the ranks. The 
all-female Lark Quartet, for example, spends part of its season in residence at 
San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Although Colorado has maintained its all-female makeup, in spite of personnel 
changes in recent years, Rosenfeld does not rule out the possibility of a male 
colleague joining the quartet. A year ago, cellist Sharon Prater resigned from 
the quartet. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the male cellists we called," said Rosenfeld, "one was available, and we 
played with him. And if he had been the best one, he would have gotten the job, 
let me tell you. But he wasn't. We are an equal opportunity employer," she 
added. (They hired Diane Chaplin; the fourth member of the quartet is violist 
Francesca Martin.) 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at 8 p.m. the Colorado Quartet will perform Mozart's Quartet No. 17 
("The Hunt") and Mel Powell's 1984 String Quartet Sunday at 8 p.m. for the La 
Jolla Chamber Music Society's SummerFest '89. Both performances are in Sherwood 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Rosenfeld and Redding discussed their musical philosophies 
and aired their complaints. As one might expect, their conversational style was 
as overlapping as the musical counterpoint they perform on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The two musicians were adamant about the value of playing new works such as 
Powell's Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dedicated to playing 20th-Century music," said Rosenfeld, "not just 
because we think its good for you, but because there is great music to be 
heard. I'm not saying that all 20th-Century music is great -- not all Beethoven 
is great, either." 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, all Beethoven is great," interrupted Redding. "But some works are 
greater than others. We are committed to versatility, giving a program that has 
as varied a menu as possible. We are not interested in 
</P>
<P>
all-Viennese, or all-Czech, or all-anything programming. Some quartets 
specialize in certain areas. We specialize in all areas." 
</P>
<P>
One area of music the Colorado Quartet is not eager to pursue, however, is that 
category of women's music, a touchy subject, according to Rosenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always calling us up and asking us to play concerts of women's 
music," she said, "and we prefer not to. We respectfully decline these 
invitations." 
</P>
<P>
"Because we are not a women's quartet," Redding added. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a string quartet that happens to be four women," Rosenfeld clarified. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to play music that we like, whether it's written by a man or a mouse," 
said Redding. "We don't play women's music for the sake of playing women's 
music." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of this antipathy towards women's music, at one point the Colorado 
Quartet wanted American composer Ellen Taafe Zwilich to write them a piece. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked Zwilich, but she turned us down because she had just won her Pulitzer 
Prize and had too many commissions to handle," Rosenfeld said. "The Zwilich 
Double Quartet that we play is a great piece, though. It just hasn't worked out 
for her and us. She is the one composer we would like to write us another 
quartet." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the Colorado Quartet has commissioned works by Ezra Laderman, 
Karel Husa, and George Tsontakis. According to Rosenfeld, they have not only 
premiered these compositions, but have diligently kept them in the ensemble's 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"But we look for pieces to revive that were commissioned and then forgotten," 
Rosenfeld said. "Our most recent discovery is a major work by the Argentine 
composer Alberto Ginestera. His Second String Quartet was commissioned by the 
Juilliard Quartet in 1958, but had all but disappeared. While there is no 
recording of it, a greater piece I could not describe." 
</P>
<P>
After more than a decade of playing with the quartet she co-founded, Redding 
harbors no illusions about the calling of an itinerant performer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that everybody imagines the life of an artiste is thrilling and very 
glamorous. The two hours on stage are thrilling, but the other 22 hours a day 
are grueling. Touring is a lot of schlepping, with very little glamour. We 
don't travel with retinues who carry luggage and make sure our car is ready at 
the car rental agency." 
</P>
<P>
Nor do they employ bodyguards to keep the autograph hounds at bay. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we're not in the Jessye Norman league," said Rosenfeld, "although some 
people occasionally do approach us in airports and say, 'Aren't you the 
Colorado Quartet?' " If Rosenfeld and Redding espouse a post-feminist ideology, 
there is one area that does vex them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to say something sexist," Rosenfeld said. "I think men have it 
easier than women do, because I haven't yet heard of a man leaving a string 
quartet because he had a baby." 
</P>
<P>
"Until men can be mothers, there's going to be an imbalance," Redding added. 
</P>
<P>
"When a woman has a baby, that becomes very important to her -- thank goodness, 
or we'd die out as a race in 75 years," Rosenfeld said. "I've known women 
(quartet players) who thought they could do it all: Barbara Katz from the 
Cleveland Quartet and Laurie Smuckler from the Mendelssohn Quartet. They tried 
and they couldn't. When we come up with the scientific answer to men having 
babies, then maybe Robert Mann will leave the Juilliard Quartet to have a baby. 
It's a specter that looms over our careers, of course, because we are four 
women." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that women can do it all," Redding said.

Pete Townshend barely escaped serious injury Wednesday during a Who concert at 
the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Wash., when the tremolo bar of his electric guitar 
pierced the webbing between the fifth and fourth fingers on his right hand. 
Townshend was executing his trademark windmill strum during "Won't Get Fooled 
Again" -- the final song before the encores -- when his hand was snagged by the 
metal bar. The band went ahead with encores of "Twist and Shout" and "Hey Joe" 
without its leader, who was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital. It was 
determined that he had suffered no nerve, bone or tendon damage, and no 
stitches were needed. According to a Who spokesman, Townshend will be able to 
perform as planned in shows tonight and Saturday in Vancouver, British 
Columbia. The Who's 25th anniversary reunion tour will reach the Southland next 
week. CLAUDIA PUIG

Battling to keep the movie industry from fleeing California to other states, 
the State Board of Equalization has agreed to hand out tax breaks to companies 
that perform contract work for motion-picture studios. The board voted, 3-0, 
Tuesday to approve a 25-page list of changes to the state tax code, exempting 
companies that support the movie industry from paying some sales taxes. "I 
think it's a good regulation now. It will certainly help the movie industry in 
California stay competitive," said board member Ernest Dronenburg Jr. "We are 
competing nationally now." The board implemented a series of changes in the tax 
laws that were approved last year by the Legislature to make taxes "consistent" 
for all segments of the highly specialized film industry, Dronenburg said. 
Existing laws excused movie studios from paying certain sales taxes, but failed 
to exempt specialized companies that animate motion pictures, film special 
effects, build sets, sew costumes, record and edit sound tracks, and perform 
other essential functions for the movie industry.

KING: '70S SOFT-ROCKER GETS TOUGH FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the cover of her signature album, "Tapestry," Carole King appeared as a 
serene Madonna for the soft-rock early '70s, dressed in denim and wool and 
surrounded by her knitting and her tabby cat. 
</P>
<P>
On stage Wednesday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, there were 
moments when a miniskirted, black-booted King resembled a Madonna of a 
different sort -- or, to pick someone closer to her own age, perhaps a 
high-stepping Tina Turner. For significant segments of her two-hour show before 
a scaled-down but extremely happy house of about 2,500 fans, this 47-year-old 
mellow-pop icon strutted and pranced and behaved like a frisky, fun-loving 
rocker. 
</P>
<P>
Not a minute of it was forced: Doing the Locomotion for all she was worth, King 
seemed like a Natural Woman -- and the fun she was so clearly having proved 
infectious. 
</P>
<P>
This unexpected strong suit as a confident rocker gave King a thoroughly 
winning hand that she played with command and finesse. When she wasn't bopping 
out in front of her sharp, young, seven-member band, she could retreat to her 
reliable grand piano and play those sure-fire selections from "Tapestry" -- 10 
in all, sprinkled judiciously through the set, most of them in crowd-pleasing, 
close-to-the-original form (the one major departure was an inspired, funk-rap 
recasting of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow?"). 
</P>
<P>
King balanced those mostly introspective "Tapestry" songs with an even older, 
but more exuberant batch from her '60s days as a Tin Pan Alley hit-generator 
(along with lyricist/ex-husband Gerry Goffin). Splice in seven well-placed 
songs from her solid new album, "City Streets," and the result was a show that 
was familiar without being dated and that shifted constantly in musical focus 
and emotional mood as it built to a wonderful concluding sequence: a feisty, 
sexual "I Feel the Earth Move," touching solo encore readings of "A Natural 
Woman" and "You've Got a Friend," and a romping finale with "The Locomotion," 
in which King and her band were helped out by opening act Wayne Toups and 
Zydecajun. Accordionist Toups' warm-up set wouldn't have pleased cajun-zydeco 
purists, but it should have satisfied anyone interested in zestful, well-played 
roots rock. MIKE BOEHM

"Loaded" is a group show with a big, slippery theme: "The placement of the body 
in social, psychological, theoretical and aestheticized ways." It takes a while 
to figure out how these ideas apply to each of the disparate objects in the 
show, but having the theme as a guide proves helpful in coming to grips with 
some of the odder pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Fehlau's "Blinder" pieces have to do with the mind's ability to piece 
together bits of information discovered by moving both the eyes as well as the 
entire body. Millie Wilson's multipart paintings of newspaper pages seem to be 
about editorial judgments pertaining to the size and placement of photographs 
that get in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Romano's discreetly bulging, plaster fig-leaf painting blends with the 
color of the wall -- a wry allusion to the supposed invisibility, in polite 
society, of the male sex organ. Michael Tidmus' "Next," a piece one reads from 
the implacable screen of a MacIntosh computer, presents fiction and fact about 
AIDS. Mark Niblock's intensely evocative text-cum-photograph moves the reader 
into a fanciful dream with a bitter edge about AIDS and death. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Seager's large, narrow suitcases stacked on top of each other suggest an 
irresolute body -- at once in flight and at rest, and determined to take up as 
little space as possible. In "Plank Piece," Charles Ray photographs a body 
punishing itself: a man who hangs from his stomach and from his knees on a 
plank wedged against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Seidler's bizarre arrangements of lead-enclosed shapes resemble office 
furniture and machines both recognizable and mysterious. They come in different 
sizes -- "normal" and miniature -- suggesting a bizarre "other dimension." Yves 
Klein's "Blue Venus" -- the familiar armless torso painted in the artist's 
special shade of electric blue -- makes the impudent claim that an artist can 
re-create a famous sculpture simply by recoloring it. 
</P>
<P>
Other work is by Maria Lonner, Martha Godfrey, Doug Hammett, Belinda Raczka, 
Tim Ebner, Nayland Blake and Allan McCollum. (Richard Kuhlenschmidt Gallery, 
1634 17th St., until Saturday.) CATHY CURTIS

David Lynch, the film maker of "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet" fame, is back 
with more pictures from the netherworld roiling just under the skin of everyday 
life -- but on canvas and paper rather than celluloid. Phrases spelled with 
individual letters cut out of paper (like anonymous death notes) cluster on the 
black grounds of the paintings, thinly populated by gangly striding stick 
figures, the blocky outlines of buildings or windows, thin skitterings of light 
and smoke-ring clouds. 
</P>
<P>
In "Can Billy Come Out and Play?" the words belong to a bawling dirty-white 
face near the bottom of the painting. An obsessive collage of Band-Aid strips 
clings to one edge of the canvas and a window-like area is sullied with 
rainy-day streams of built-up wax. Other paintings recall nocturnal urban 
journeys ("On a Windy Night A Figure Walked to Jumbo's Klown Room") or great 
open spaces ("Boise, Idaho"). 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's pastel drawings, in soft grays and luminous white, are somewhat 
reminiscent of Arthur Dove's organic abstractions. In "Introducing One Brand 
New Cloud," a patch of glowing whiteness -- like a draped hank of silk -- hangs 
on a soft gray field. Suffused by a gentle unearthliness, the simple image 
yields an unexpected sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lynch's art flirts with cuteness, its authenticity and freshness win 
the viewer over. The surprising thing is how mild and plaintive the large but 
wispy paintings are, compared with the films. (James Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th 
St., to Sept. 9.) CATHY CURTIS

"Victoria" seems an odd title for works in a range of media by a passel of 
artists, until you see what they're up to. As a group, these pieces share a 
taste for aspects of Victoriana -- from fussy ornamentation to medieval 
revivalism and fin de siecle decadence. But nearly all the artists replace the 
Victorians' cheerfully positivistic attitude with the restless, ironic 
attitudes of our time, yielding intriguing marriages of form and idea. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Preston's "Pendants" are a trio of giant, plump dangling bobbles in ruby 
velvet with fussy curves resembling double-sided silhouettes. In a set of 
paintings on Masonite, "Four Portraits (Echo)," Sabina Ott offers the faint, 
lingering traces of a portrait gallery consigned to corrosion and neglect. One 
of these memento mori images has the emaciated quality of a Giacometti head; 
another is a noble male profile furtively nibbled away by a waxy, yellowing 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Lari Pittman's set of "Souvenir of This Century" paintings on paper contain 
clusters of old-fashioned oval-inset portrait silhouettes along with the 
artist's familiar mix of energized typographic devices and fine-line doodling. 
The doodles -- fantastic scenes of chivalry, flag-waving celebration and 
aquatic high jinks -- leave teasingly imprecise exactly which century is being 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Dede Bazyk's triptych "The Body Is a Fence" brackets an image of an Indian 
contortionist between an X-ray of a hand and a drawing of a crustacean -- as if 
to "prove" a Darwinian point about adaptive bone structure. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Rollins and K.O.S. (Kids of Survival, a group of South Bronx teen-agers 
with whom Rollins created a workshop) paint fancifully ornamental gold horns on 
pages of Franz Kafka's novel "Amerika" -- an activity that calls to mind both 
medieval manuscript illumination and the social programs of the Victorian Arts 
and Crafts movement. Tom Knechtel's delicate silverpoint drawings breathe life 
into a pair of chatting rodents reminiscent of characters in "The Wind in the 
Willows"; his dreamy gouache, "A Congress of Wonders," evokes an old-fashioned 
celestial fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The devil gets equal time in David Best's beak-nosed portrait, framed in a 
gothic thicket of branches and thorns, and the balding, red-faced, horned guys 
Fred Stonehouse paints on pages of antique botanical and entomological 
drawings. 
</P>
<P>
A dry echo of Wildean decadence seeps into Cliff Benjamin's drawing "Sodomy" 
(the title word written in large Olde English script above a writhing floral 
ornamental border) and informs a series of photographs by Arne Svenson in which 
views of stocking-covered heads, curtains and knotholes create the effect of 
bizarre amateur theatricals. (Pence Gallery, 908 Colorado Ave., to Sept. 1.)

The watercolor-marker whimsy of John Randolph Carter probably most strongly 
recalls the comic book-style drawing of Philip Guston. The 
stream-of-consciousness drawing also evokes bored adolescents doodling away 
during high school math class. Carter's images have that kind of free flowing 
fantasy -- an exuberance unimpeded by narrative consistency. In drawings like 
"Orange Monster With Floating Faces and Small Animals," they simply exult in 
extraordinary forms that mutate as they come flowing out of the pen to be set 
ablaze with bright color. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of hedonistic outpouring from the unconscious flavors all the 
earliest work. It's fun and joyous even though the lack of meaning eventually 
nags at the vacuous, colorful designs. 
</P>
<P>
Later imagery in black and white communicates a troubled, ruminative edge. In 
one, four figures passively sit with bags over their heads like prisoners 
awaiting the gallows. The same figure and one doppelganger appears in a drawing 
that fairly breathes with frustration about going nowhere on a butcher block 
island between freeways and oceans. 
</P>
<P>
From these few recent drawings it's difficult to tell if the more complex, 
thought-provoking imagery is a new direction for Carter's cartoons. If so, the 
emotional power is a welcome addition to work already at home in the surreal 
arena of the unconscious. (Orlando Gallery, 14553 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, 
to Aug. 25.) SUVAN GEER

HOME TECH: PARENTS' CHOICE PUBLISHES GUIDE TO VIDEOCASSETTES FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Parents' Choice Guide to Videocassettes for Children" has just been 
published by Consumer Reports Books. Put together by Diana Huss Green, editor 
of Parents' Choice magazine, and several other authors, the $13.95 guide 
reviews more than 300 videos of special interest to kids. 
</P>
<P>
The movie "Scandal," which started a small scandal of its own over a sex scene 
edited out to qualify the British sex-and-politics film for an R rating earlier 
this year, will be released in both the R-rated and the original, uncut 
versions by HBO Video on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Animal lovers (lovers of animated animals, anyway) and animal haters get equal 
time on Oct. 12, when Touchstone Home Video releases "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" 
and Paramount Home Video releases "Pet Semetary." 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
"The Wizard of Oz" is being re-released by MGM/UA in a "50th Anniversary" 
edition this week. The price is $24.98, but a fabric-softener company is 
offering $5 rebate coupons (as well as a commercial at the start of the tape) 
that will bring the price down to $19.98. 
</P>
<P>
The new videocassette version of the beloved 1939 film also includes 
approximately 17 minutes of appended material. Among the extras: some Ray 
Bolger dancing (as the Scarecrow, of course) cut from the film; the audio track 
of the deleted "Jitterbug" number and of Buddy Ebsen (the first-hired Tin Man) 
singing "If I Only Had a Heart," both illustrated by stills (and by home movies 
in the case of "The Jitterbug"); a theatrical trailer for the film, and 
newsreel film of Judy Garland receiving a special Oscar for her part in "Oz." 
</P>
<P>
The tape also features an improved sound track and has been remastered, 
brightening the Technicolor and restoring the sepia tone to the noncolor Kansas 
segments. 
</P>
<P>
At six hours, "Little Dorrit" was the longest major film of last year and, many 
critics believed, one of the best. The G-rated Charles Dickens adaptation -- 
starring Alec Guinness, Derek Jacobi and several other top British actors -- 
comes as two two-cassette packages (titled "Nobody's Fault" and "Little 
Dorrit's Story") from Warner. The price is $89.95 per package. 
</P>
<P>
"Patty Hearst" (Media, $89.95, R) is the 1988 film directed by Paul Schrader, 
telling the story of the heiress' kidnapping largely from her point of view 
(Hearst is played by Natasha Richardson). "Tap" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13) 
brought together young hoofer Gregory Hines and old hoofer Sammy Davis, Jr. in 
a lukewarm tale about tap dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseur has released Shohei Imamura's black comedy "The Pornographers" 
($79.95) in letter-box format, subtitled. The company has also re-released two 
Luis Bunuel classics from his Mexican period, "Los Olvidados" ($59.95) and 
"Nazarin" ($69.95), plus Orson Welles' version of Kafka's "The Trial" ($39.95) 
-- all three previously available from another label. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent movies new on video: "The Wash" (Academy, $79.95, unrated), "Hit 
List" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) and "Under the Boardwalk" (New World, $89.95, 
R). 
</P>
<P>
Other vintage films: "Tokyo Joe," a 1949 drama that's one of Humphrey Bogart's 
least-known films; "The Lady in Question," in which Rita Hayworth and Glenn 
Ford made their first joint cinematic appearance (1940); "I Am the Law," a 1938 
film that had Edward G. Robinson -- playing against type -- as a professor 
fighting gangsters, and "Ten Wanted Men," a 1955 Randolph Scott Western. 
They're $69.95 each from RCA/Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Price reductions: CBS/Fox has slashed the price, so to speak, on several 
horror/sci-films to $19.98, including "Aliens," "The Fly" (the '86 version), 
"Damien: Omen II" and "The Legend of Hell House." Even lower are "Dawn of the 
Dead" and "Return of the Living Dead," now $14.99 from HBO. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Is it too early for Christmas videos? Family Home Entertainment doesn't think 
so. Last week FHE released four Yuletide tapes (previously shown on TV) for 
$14.95: "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (the "Animagic" musical version 
narrated by Burl Ives, 53 minutes), "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (narrated 
by Fred Astaire, 53 minutes), "Little Drummer Boy" (with the voices of Greer 
Garson, Jose Ferrer and the Vienna Boys Choir, 30 minutes) and "Frosty the 
Snowman" (narrated by Jimmy Durante, 30 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
"Impact Video Magazine, Volume One" (MPI, $19.95, 80 minutes) is the first in a 
series of tapes that will take a "cutting-edge" look at the arts, with an 
emphasis on the more daring forms of pop music. Featured in this volume: rap 
group Public Enemy, L.A. rock band Jane's Addiction, the famous short film 
"Bambi Meets Godzilla" and painter Robert Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Video-game helpers: MPI has released the second volume of its "Secret Video 
Game Tricks, Codes &amp; Strategies" ($14.95, 45 minutes). It focuses on 
Nintendo-compatible games. So does "Video Game Guide" (Studio Video, $9.99, 40 
minutes). For information on the latter tape, call (800) 541-1843. TERRY

'BREAKING POINT' THRILLS IN HITCHCOCKIAN VEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American intelligence officer, carrying vital knowledge about the Allies' 
planned invasion of Normandy, is captured and tortured by the Nazis. He wakes 
up in an American military hospital in Germany and learns the war has been over 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Or has it? 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's TNT cable movie "Breaking Point," at 5 p.m. and again at 7, 9 and 11 
p.m., is an abundantly stylish remake of "36 Hours," the 1964 film with James 
Garner, Eva Marie Saint and Rod Taylor. Directed by Peter Markle and written by 
Stanley Greenberg, this suspense thriller in the Hitchcockian vein entangles 
both hero and audience in an intricate web of deception. 
</P>
<P>
Markle has cast his principal cast with care. Corbin Bernsen ("L.A. Law") is 
the bothered and bewildered amnesia victim, Maj. Jefferson Pike. His wife Diana 
is dead, he's told, but nurse Anna, a former inmate of Dachau -- or is she? -- 
hauntingly resembles her (exquisite Joanna Pacula plays both roles). Dr. Walter 
Gerber (John Glover), who seems to take Pike's case to heart, encourages Pike 
to cross the "psychological chasm" that blocks his memory by talking about what 
he last remembers: The plans for D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
Director of photography Don Burgess' moody lighting makes a major contribution 
to the film's pervasive, vaguely threatening atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
There are some lapses. The physical evidence offered to Pike as proof of the 
postwar date is too slight. It was more substantial in the original film. And 
just as the original's finale bogged down, Greenberg, Markle and the fine cast 
don't altogether carry it off here either, despite fundamental script changes. 
The climactic chase scene is wildly self-indulgent; it could have been lifted 
from countless action films. 
</P>
<P>
Still, getting there is delicious, beginning with the opening credits, which 
roll over stark, black-and-white World War II newsreel footage as Billie 
Holiday's sweet, mournful voice is heard singing in the background.

THE COWBOY WAY IS ONLY WAY FOR RIDERS IN THE SKY; 
</P>
<P>
MULTI-TALENTED PERFORMERS DO RIGHT THINGS ON RADIO AND IN PERSON 
</P>

If your radio dial has ever drifted into left field -- 88.5 to be exact -- on a 
Saturday afternoon, you may have heard the strains of three-part cowboy 
harmonies, songs about blue skies and cattle and faithful ponies. Perhaps you 
heard a pitch for the imaginary Deadwood Darlene's Prairie Lubricants. Maybe 
you turned up the volume when groups such as the O'Kanes, John Hartford, Gary 
Morris and Asleep at the Wheel started to sing. 
</P>
<P>
"Riders Radio Theater," which airs at 2:30 p.m. Saturdays and is rebroadcast at 
10:30 a.m. Mondays, recalls the Western radio variety shows of the 1940s and 
might be compared to "A Prairie Home Companion." Each week, listeners to about 
100 public radio stations across the country hear a variety show that includes 
live music, guest-star appearances and a serial that takes place at the "Triple 
X Ranch." The half-hour show is performed, written, directed and produced by 
three musicians who bill themselves as Ranger Doug (Douglas B. Green), Woody 
Paul (Paul Chrisman) and Too Slim (Fred LaBour). 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of our most popular programs," said Pat Kowalick, KCSN production 
manager. In a survey taken in March, 25% of KCSN subscribers cited "Riders 
Radio Theater" as their favorite program. At its recent convention, the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting gave the show awards in the categories of 
general music and technical achievement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their radio show, the Riders are recording artists -- their 10th 
and latest album, on MCA, is titled "Riders Go Commercial' -- and they 
frequently take their act on the road. The trio will be in concert at 7 and 
9:30 p.m. tomorrow at the Granada Hills Masonic Auditorium (a children's show 
is scheduled for 3 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
"Riders Radio Theater" originates at WPLN in Nashville, where the Riders corral 
their fans for live tapings at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We rope'em and drag'em in," said Green, a.k.a. Ranger Doug, who plays guitar. 
"Something we do touches them. The heart and soul of the West means something 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
Riders in the Sky, who seem to enjoy wearing colorful cowboy get-ups even when 
they're not performing, provide all the voices of the characters in their 
shows, including those of their arch-nemesis, A. Swinburne Slocum, and his 
bumbling lackey, Charlie. They are helped by their accordion-playing sidekick, 
Joey the Cowpolka King, and their suave announcer, Texas Bix Bender. 
</P>
<P>
The Riders are all in their early 40s -- Green is 43, Chrisman is 40 and LaBour 
is 41 -- but they neither look nor act their age. In character, they are 
alarmingly clean-cut. The strongest oath heard so far on "Riders Radio Theater" 
is "holy heifer!" (spoken by Sheriff Drywall, alias Woody Paul alias Paul 
Chrisman). But some of their material takes a literary or political turn. 
("Woody, I knew Will Rogers. Will Rogers was a friend of mine. Woody, you're no 
Will Rogers.") 
</P>
<P>
Green, whose alter-ego Ranger Doug is also known as "the Idol of American 
Youth" on the show, is the level-headed leading man and, at last count, the 
only one who ever gets the girl. He has a larger than life quality on stage and 
an astonishing cowboy yodel. 
</P>
<P>
Chrisman's Woody Paul is known to fans as "the King of the Cowboy Fiddlers" or, 
when doing his rope tricks, "the King of the Clothesline." His character is an 
enigma, seeming a bit slow at first but actually possessed of a scientific and 
mathematical genius that has helped the intrepid cowboys escape certain death 
from floods and avalanches. (Chrisman has a Ph.D. in physics from MIT -- a 
little something to fall back on, he says, in case this singing cowboy thing 
doesn't work out.) 
</P>
<P>
LaBour's Too Slim, "the Man of Many Hats," is the group's standout comedian, 
with an impressive range of character voices. In addition to the evil Slocum, 
LaBour's repertoire includes Side Meat, the feisty old chuck wagon cook (whose 
secret biscuit ingredient is cement); Freddy La, the Surfin' Cowboy; and an 
assortment of oil frontier salesmen hawking services to the cattle trade. 
</P>
<P>
If the Riders have a theme, it's something called "the Cowboy Way," a lifelong 
pledge to always do the right thing. Frequently, this philosophy turns up 
during their radio adventures as a concern for the environment. (Slocum once 
tried to poison the Los Angeles water supply, hoping to make fast bucks by 
selling bottled water.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty easy for us to be on the side of taking care of the environment," 
Green said. "You can't love the West without loving the out-of-doors and caring 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
The three musicians got together in 1978 in Nashville, where they had solo 
careers as acoustic musicians. Riders in the Sky first took their stage show on 
the road 11 years ago this week. On Wednesday night in Santa Cruz, they logged 
their 2,000th performance. Those attending tomorrow's concert in Granada Hills 
will find the trio quite accessible, for the cowboys' policy is to linger in 
lobbies after the show, autographing Riders' merchandise from Too Slim's 
Mercantile, dispensing handshakes and hugs. These fan-bonding sessions, they 
say, pay off in the long run and are as enjoyable and as much a part of the 
show as anything they do on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, though the Riders express a strong willingness to get involved in 
television and movies, the continuation of "Riders Radio Theater" remains a 
high priority. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for a corporate, white-hatted godfather to ride to our rescue 
and say, 'We will fund this wonderful show,' " LaBour said. 
</P>
<P>
"And he's looking for us too," added Chrisman, "only he doesn't know who we are 
-- -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's keep the airwaves safe for the Cowboy Way." 
</P>

GOOD FOOD AT A NIGHTCLUB? HEY, IT CAN HAPPEN; DIP INTO SEAFOOD AT MONTEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who would go to a Jamaican-themed night club that looks like a set from "Miami 
Vice" and expect to get an Italian meal? Not me. How would I know that 
neon-flashed Montego would have an Italian chef and a fairly good one at that? 
Plain blind luck. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be interested in reggae music (Friday nights) or the 20s 
single scene (Friday and Saturday nights) to have a good evening here, but it 
helps. Although part of the dining room is considerately separated from the 
bar/lounge/dance floor/bandstand areas by thick plate glass, the music is still 
intrusive. And, yes, the place is enormous and utterly open, including the 
kitchen. Given the panoramic views from your booth, it's no surprise that 
Montego is a voyeur's delight. 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising, considering that Montego isn't principally a restaurant, is 
that what the kitchen does best, it does very well. With discretion, you can 
put together quite a good meal. 
</P>
<P>
Montego seems to have an especially good source for shellfish -- which account 
for more than half of the appetizers. A dish of fried oysters, placed back in 
their shells on a bed of diced mango salsa, was unexpectedly refreshing. 
Another worthy starter was steamed mussels and naturally sweet clams in a pulpy 
herbed tomato broth. After the tasty mollusks had been quickly consumed, the 
remaining broth was greedily absorbed into freshly baked rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Other appetizers, though no less freshly made, lacked sufficient flavor: They 
included a generous seafood salad of calamari, clams, mussels and shrimp, fried 
tender calamari and boiled shrimp on cold diced eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
The high quality of foodstuffs and sometimes of preparation at Montego 
continues into the entrees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Pizzaiola is one of the most commonly bastardized Neapolitan ways of preparing 
meat. At Montego they serve three thick, tender slices of top-quality beef 
tenderloin with such flavorsome chunks of tomato, olive and garlic seasoned 
with oregano that you'd think you were at a peasant picnic in the country 
outside of Naples. And the lamb chops: three (is this a magic number?) and not 
the kind with tasteless meat looking like mini-prime rib, but the kind with 
well-textured meat and wonderful tasting fat, napped with an unobtrusive 
mustard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Fish entrees have been no less interesting. Grilled sea bass served with an 
unexpected cold tomato caper sauce was a welcome surprise, and mahi-mahi with a 
red bell pepper puree was also successful. The simply prepared vegetables 
(carrots, zucchini, yellow squash) that accompany the fish and meat dishes have 
been uniformly appealing, and new potatoes, boiled, then roasted briefly with 
rosemary, were outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
An insipid pizza Margherita gave this category of the menu little hope. Also 
disappointing were the desserts, which included a cheesecake with a raspberry 
jelly topping. 
</P>
<P>
The wine list was "in transition," which meant there wasn't one. There were 
almost no wines -- just two or three Cabernets and Chardonnays and a Chianti. 
An excellent Shafer merlot enjoyed one evening was no longer available five 
days later. Clearly beer and liquor take precedence over wine here. 
</P>
<P>
It says a lot for how far we've come in recent years that a place like Montego 
serves food as good as it does. I'd like to believe that our standards of 
expectation are now so high that we no longer assume we'll be served 
muddy-flavored preparations made from mediocre ingredients -- even in a glitzy, 
noisy nightclub decorated with fake palm trees. 
</P>

SAUGUS LAND TO BE SOUGHT FOR WATER PLANT, CITY HALL 
</P>

<P>
Santa Clarita and the Castaic Lake Water Agency have agreed to work together to 
buy the defunct Saugus Rehabilitation Center, a prime 520-acre parcel owned by 
the city of Los Angeles, for a water treatment plant and city hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council and the water agency board, meeting in a joint 
session Wednesday night, agreed to form a committee to oversee their campaign 
to purchase the Saugus property. The council also agreed that the agency, which 
has already made overtures to Los Angeles concerning the parcel, will take the 
lead in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement eliminated a point of friction between Santa Clarita and the 
agency. During the meeting, council members said they had been annoyed to learn 
recently that the agency was trying to obtain the rehabilitation center without 
city involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said he thought the city and agency had 
agreed about a year ago to pursue the property together. Water agency directors 
replied that newspaper accounts had led them to believe the city was no longer 
interested in the rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, agency Director Mary R. Spring said the city and agency had come 
to an agreement in principle over plans for the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multiple Uses Planned 
</P>
<P>
The agency wants to build a water treatment plant by 1992 on 65 to 80 acres of 
the site. Santa Clarita would like to build a city hall, park and perhaps an 
arts complex. The city has temporary offices in the top floor of the Valencia 
National Bank Building. The city's lease expires in 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Representing Santa Clarita on the city-agency committee are McKeon, 
Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy, City Manager George Caravalho and City Atty. Carl 
K. Newton. Representing the water agency are Spring, General Manager Robert C. 
Sagehorn, Atty. Robert H. Clark and Director Bill J. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
During the joint meeting Wednesday, City Council members again denied that they 
have agreed to endorse plans by the city of Los Angeles to put a landfill in 
Elsmere Canyon in order to obtain favorable treatment from Los Angeles over the 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county of Los Angeles view Elsmere Canyon, just outside Santa 
Clarita, as a prime site for a dump. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city, county and federal officials negotiating a complicated land 
swap that would preserve Elsmere Canyon for a landfill have suggested that Los 
Angeles could deed portions of the Saugus rehabilitation site to Santa Clarita 
to induce the young city to support an Elsmere landfill. "Their discussions 
have not included us," Santa Clarita Councilman Dennis Koontz said Thursday.

FISTFIGHTS ERUPT AT MEETING ON STREET EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fistfights and shoving matches erupted outside a homeowners meeting in Encino 
on Thursday between residents on opposite sides of a street-building quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of a crowd of about 300 that had gathered outside the auditorium 
of Lanai Road Elementary School, where City Councilman Marvin Braude was to 
appear, began shouting and shoving each other about 10 minutes before the 
meeting began. 
</P>
<P>
About nine persons were involved in two separate melees over the issue of 
extending Reseda Boulevard southward into the Santa Monica Mountains, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just walking in the street when I was thrown to the ground," said Rob 
Glushon, president of the Encino Property Owners Assn. "Somebody grabbed me 
from behind and just pushed me down." Glushon said he did not see who attacked 
him but that his knee was scraped and his pants leg torn. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said Glushon was jumped because he was tearing down protest signs 
they had erected. Glushon said the signs were illegally posted on school 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and relatives said Ben Rosenfeld, 19, of Tarzana, was taken to Tarzana 
Medical Center for treatment of an injured wrist after scuffling on the ground 
with other crowd members. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 Los Angeles police officers and a police helicopter were dispatched to 
the scene, but there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Braude arrived after the fighting ended but was jostled by the crowd as he 
tried to make his way into the auditorium, with protesters shouting that they 
were being excluded from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled at this kind of behavior," Braude said. "I've been in public 
life for 25 years and this is the first time I've been pushed." 
</P>
<P>
Police calmed the crowd but some of them banged on the doors of the school 
auditorium during the meeting, protesting that Encino residents were given 
tickets while Tarzana residents were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the Encino Property Owners Assn. and the Encino 
Hillside Traffic Safety Organization. Tarzana residents in a group called 
Friends of Caballero Canyon protested that they were being kept out. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting marked the latest battle in the dispute between Tarzana and Encino 
homeowners over the question of whether Reseda Boulevard should be extended to 
connect with Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Encino groups support the extension, which they say is necessary to relieve 
heavy weekday traffic on Encino's Hayvenhurst Avenue and adjoining streets as 
Los Angeles Basin commuters seek an alternate route to the slow-moving San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
They say that if Reseda Boulevard extended to Mulholland, commuter traffic 
would spread onto that route. 
</P>
<P>
Encino homeowners argue that residents of Tarzana -- the only community on the 
San Fernando Valley's southern edge that is not bisected by a cross-mountain 
route -- are not sharing the burden of commuter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The Tarzana group protests that extending the street will encourage 
development.

PRICE OF PROGRESS SOARS IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
$912 MILLION IN CAPITAL SPENDING TO BE NEEDED BY 2010, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley will need $912 million in capital improvements -- from 
new roads and libraries to water treatment plants and parks -- to serve the 
burgeoning valley by 2010, a new report by Los Angeles County predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Another $31 million will be needed to provide similar services in Acton, a 
growing community of 7,500 residents between Santa Clarita and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by a consulting firm for the Department of Regional 
Planning, is intended as a planning tool for officials in Santa Clarita, the 
county and other agencies. The department in February said the Santa Clarita 
Valley was the fastest growing region in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to get an overall grasp" of the valley's needs, said Jene 
McKnight, a supervising regional planner with the county. The report, released 
Wednesday, compiled the plans of state, county and local agencies and made 
recommendations for construction projects based upon population projections for 
the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the projects are under way already; others remain on the drawing board. 
Funding would come from the state, county, Santa Clarita, assessment districts 
and perhaps the federal government, McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water System 
</P>
<P>
The largest expense would be $428 million to expand and improve the valley's 
water system. That cost includes a new filtration plant proposed by the Castaic 
Lake Water Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding the region's water system is crucial, the report said. "The valley 
used about 68% of its available water supply in 1987," the report said. "By 
2010, the valley may be using as much as 96% of the available supply." 
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended water conservation measures to cut down on an 
unusually high use of water in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the valley will need eight new fire stations -- an $8.8-million 
expense. It will cost $65.8 million to obtain and prepare 642 acres for use as 
parks the valley will need in 20 years, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommended building new libraries in Castaic, Val Verde, Agua 
Dulce, Acton, Pinetree and North River, a new housing development planned north 
of Valencia. It also recommended expanding existing libraries in Valencia, 
Canyon Country and Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
Building an additional 135,000 square feet of library space will cost $14 
million, the report said. Purchasing 405,000 books to fill the new library 
shelves would cost $4.85 million. 
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that it will cost $51 million for new waste-water systems, 
$160 million for garbage disposal and $178 million for roads and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
The report provided only a partial list of bridge and highway projects in the 
valley. A study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments, for example, 
last year projected that the valley will need road projects worth $340 million 
by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanded Dump 
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended expanding the Chiquita Canyon dump in Valencia to 
handle the valley's garbage. Permits to operate the landfill expire in 1991, 
but new permits could extend the life of the dump 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
The report's recommendations were based on county population estimates for the 
Santa Clarita Valley. Those estimates, released in 1987, are already outdated. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the county projected that the valley population would reach 
140,000 by 1990. Santa Clarita alone now has 147,000 residents, the state 
estimates. By 2010, the county estimates, the valley will be home to 270,000 
people.

MAN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING IS KILLER WHO FLED CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

An 18-year-old gang member arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting in 
Palmdale on Friday had escaped last month from juvenile custody after being 
convicted of murdering a Sylmar man, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Perez of Sylmar was arrested shortly before midnight Wednesday at a 
Lancaster motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective John Kalita said. Perez 
is one of three men believed to have fired numerous rounds Friday night at two 
cars they mistakenly believed carried rival gang members, Kalita said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred after a fistfight in a Lancaster parking lot in which 
members of Perez's gang were beaten, Kalita said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
None Seriously Hurt 
</P>
<P>
None of the three victims were seriously injured in the shooting, Kalita said. 
One was treated at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center for scrapes to his face 
from flying glass, and the others did not seek medical treatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez had escaped from the custody of a juvenile probation officer during a 
doctor's visit at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar on July 11, Kalita said. 
He had been convicted of the murder of Juan Silva, 19, of Sylmar in March, and 
was being detained at Sylmar Juvenile Hall before being sent to the California 
Youth Authority to serve his sentence, said Los Angeles Police Detective Jay 
St. John. 
</P>
<P>
Perez shot Silva in the head while the two were arguing about which of them was 
dealing the best cocaine, St. John said. Perez had been previously convicted of 
several narcotics trafficking charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was a juvenile when he killed Silva, but he had turned 18 four days 
before Friday night's shooting and will be tried as an adult in the case, 
Kalita said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez is being held in lieu of $15,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned 
today on six counts of assault with a deadly weapon and two counts of shooting 
at an occupied vehicle, Kalita said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the other suspects in Friday night's shooting -- Freddy Ruiz, 18, of 
Quartz Hill and Thomas Merrick, 19, of Lancaster -- were arrested a short time 
after the shooting. Jason Marmon, 18, of Quartz Hill, who allegedly drove the 
car from which the men fired, was arrested Monday. He is not believed to have 
fired any of the shots, Kalita said.

SCHOOL OFFICIAL WON'T FACE WIFE-ABUSE CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
No criminal charges will be brought against the board president of the Antelope 
Valley Union High School District, who was arrested last month on suspicion of 
striking his wife during a marital dispute, the district attorney's office said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file a misdemeanor 
spouse-abuse charge against William M. Olenick, who is seeking reelection to 
his school board seat in November. Also, his estranged wife decided not to 
press criminal charges, they added. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of insufficient evidence from the get-go," said Stephen L. 
Cooley, head deputy in the district attorney's Antelope Valley office. "It 
would be inappropriate to file this case. There was absolutely no independent 
corroboration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Problem 
</P>
<P>
The decision eases the political problem faced by Olenick, 37, who works as a 
county probation officer at a juvenile detention camp. He is one of seven 
candidates seeking three seats in the Nov. 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Olenick, 36, filed for divorce shortly after last month's incident. The 
couple's argument at their Quartz Hill area home on July 19 escalated when she 
ordered him out of the house, said sheriff's deputies and prosecutors. Wendy 
Olenick claimed her enraged husband struck her in the mouth with the back of 
his hand, bloodying her lip. 
</P>
<P>
Olenick maintained that his wife's injury was self-inflicted. "He claimed she 
went into the bathroom and split her own lip" in a successful attempt to have 
him arrested by sheriff's deputies, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no witnesses, Cooley said, officers are obligated to arrest 
the uninjured party in such cases because of a change in state law intended to 
curb spousal abuse. In the past, some police agencies have been criticized for 
overlooking domestic disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave us one version of events leading up to his arrest," Cooley said. "She 
gave an entirely different version. There was no way to tell which one was 
telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insufficient Evidence 
</P>
<P>
During a preliminary review, the district attorney's office concluded that 
there was insufficient evidence for prosecution, Cooley said. But the matter 
was referred to a district attorney's hearing officer for review before a final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The couple presented their conflicting versions of the incident at an Aug. 9 
hearing. But hearing officer Janie Wible recommended against filing criminal 
charges, Cooley said, who added that there was no evidence of any prior abusive 
behavior by the husband. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene E. Siegel, an attorney representing Wendy Olenick in her divorce case, 
said she declined to press criminal charges because she "really wants a 
peaceful resolution." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who have a young son, have separated. Wendy Olenick continues to 
live in their Quartz Hill home. William Olenick has said he is living elsewhere 
but within the boundaries of the high school district, as election law 
requires. Neither could be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Olenick filed his nominating papers last Friday to qualify for the ballot in 
the school board contest, using the address of his former residence, where he 
remains registered to vote.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 291 to 123, the House approved a fiscal 1990 budget of $1.6 
billion for itself and congressional support agencies. That is an increase of 
14% over the comparable fiscal 1989 bill. After the Senate adds its budget of 
more than $400 million, the cost of operating the legislative branch in 1990 
will top $2 billion. Members' salaries of nearly $50 million are funded 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
Among items in the House-passed bill are $188 million for the salaries of House 
members' personal staffs (up 5% from the comparable 1989 figure), $118 million 
for committee operations including staff salaries (up 7%) and $123 million for 
House members' and senators' free-mail privileges. The postage sum is 
open-ended and likely to be increased, despite new language reducing from six 
to four the number of mass mailings that House members can send to constituents 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Cutting Congress' Budget 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 167 to 246, the House rejected an amendment cutting nearly all 
areas of the 1990 legislative branch budget (above) by 6.25%, for a savings of 
$97 million. "What used to be called the '$1-billion Congress' has become the 
'$2-billion Congress,' " said amendment sponsor Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.). 
Opponent Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) said the amendment "would cut some items that 
are very fundamental in terms of the members' ability to work around this 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a 6.25% cut in the fiscal 1990 legislative branch

Debt Limit

The House voted 231 to 185 to raise the national debt ceiling by $70 billion to 
about $2.87 trillion. The new limit, which was sent to the Senate, will enable 
the government to pay its bills while awaiting congressional approval of a 
separate measure putting the federal borrowing limit at $3.123 trillion.

Abortion 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 206 to 219, the House refused to further restrict abortion in the 
District of Columbia. The defeated amendment sought to renew a ban on the 
district using its own revenue as well as its federal payment to provide 
abortions for the poor. It also sought to toughen the ban so that the 
district's own money could no longer be spent on abortions deemed necessary 
because the woman's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred during debate on the district appropriations bill for fiscal 
1990, later sent to the Senate. It liberalizes federal abortion law as it is 
applied to the district. But the federal city remains severely restricted in 
using money it gets from the U.S. Treasury for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to further restrict public funding of abortions in 
the District of Columbia.

Savings and Loan Rescue 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 170 to 250, the House rejected a GOP attempt to put the cost of 
the savings and loan rescue off the federal budget. The vote kept the thrift 
bailout bill from being sent back to a House-Senate conference committee, where 
the off-budget language was to have been added. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the bill was returned to conference, after the Senate's refusal 
to waive the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law to permit counting the 
multibillion-dollar bailout as part of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was how to treat about $50 billion in immediate borrowing needed to 
close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts and meet insurance obligations to 
depositors. The reworked bill taken up by the House and Senate late Friday put 
$20 billion of the borrowing on this year's budget, as most Democrats wanted, 
and left the remaining $30 billion to be raised by industry bonds as advocated 
by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported an off-budget financing arrangement for the 
savings and loan bailout.

1 KILLED IN ACCIDENT NEAR FRAZIER PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One person died in a fiery three-vehicle accident Thursday night on the Golden 
State Freeway about 10 miles north of Frazier Park, according to the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which occurred about 8 p.m., involved a semitrailer truck loaded 
with rolled wire, a passenger car and a rental truck. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, the truck was engulfed in flames in the center divider. 
The driver was severely injured and taken by ambulance to Bakersfield, said CHP 
Sgt. Ron Lagrande. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger car contained a body that was too severely burned to identify, 
said Officer Andy Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
Lagrande said the semitrailer brakes appeared to have overheated as the truck 
descended the northbound slope of the Grapevine. Witnesses said the brakes were 
shooting flames before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was halted in both directions for at least two hours as the CHP 
investigated and debris was cleared.

DODGERS GET THE MESSAGE;

<P>
THEY BEAT PHILLIES, 10-4, AFTER LASORDA IS LOUD AND CLEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
With the Dodgers needing help to end a two-game losing streak against the 
National League's worst pitching staff, a couple of old favorites came through 
against the Philadelphia Phillies Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
There was Mike Marshall who, if 400-foot home runs are any indication, no 
longer needs to see a chiropractor. The back is back. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Fernando Valenzuela. He loves it when the bases are loaded -- 
that is, when he is batting instead of pitching. His bases-loaded single drove 
in two runs in the sixth inning to break open a close game and turn it into an 
eventual 10-4 victory before 25,779 fans at Veterans' Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Two hitters, two theories. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marshall: "I am more selective now. I am more disciplined than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Said Valenzuela: "I stick out the bat, the ball hits it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda didn't care what they did Thursday, as long as they 
left town without being swept by the second-worst team in the league. Lasorda, 
angered f by Wednesday night's 6-2 loss here, held a loud team meeting before 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody was asleep before the meeting, they were awake afterward," said one 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the clubhouse, down the runway, out to the field, they faced former 
teammate Ken Howell, a right-hander who had given up one run to the Dodgers in 
15 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. With one out in the second inning, Franklin Stubbs lined a ball off 
Howell's pitching hand. Howell eventually left the game after five innings 
because of a bad bruise, with his team trailing, 3-2. Three Phillie relievers 
then gave up six runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who had roomed with Stubbs for two seasons while with the Dodgers, was 
miffed. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think if you had a roommate for two years, he wouldn't hit a ball at you 
like that," said Howell (9-9), who gave up three runs on six hits. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs didn't fare much better after his single off Howell. After shortstop 
Dickie Thon threw wildly to first base on Mike Huff's grounder, Stubbs tried to 
take third. He made it but kept sliding, over the bag and into foul territory. 
</P>
<P>
He not only was tagged out, he also suffered a twisted left knee. He left the 
clubhouse late Thursday wearing a thick brace and could be sidelined for 
several games. In his 22 starts, Stubbs is hitting .333 (21 for 63). 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I had to take my knee off the bag to where they could tag me," 
Stubbs said. "My body was going so fast -- I leave my leg on the base, I break 
it." 
</P>
<P>
This left the stage to Marshall and Valenzuela. One was hoping to continue his 
six-game hitting streak, the other trying to extend his three-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela didn't throw a two-hitter, as he did last Saturday in San Francisco, 
but he survived six innings, giving up three runs and nine hits. He has won 
three consecutive games and four of his last six while improving to 8-11 with a 
3.50 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Mike Scioscia said: "Under the circumstances -- it was humid, he had to 
run the bases a couple of times, he got into some trouble -- he did great. He 
got out of it just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Said Valenzuela, comparing his current streak to his early-season problems: 
"That's what's different now. Before, I throw one good (pitch), one bad, one 
so-so. Now, all are consistent. Not all are two-hitters, nine innings. But they 
are consistent. I like that." 
</P>
<P>
He likes running the bases, too. After Marshall's 10th home run of the season 
had made the score 2-2 in the fourth inning, Valenzuela's fifth-inning single 
up the middle led to a run on Alfredo Griffin's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
With the 3-2 lead, the Dodgers loaded the bases against reliever Larry 
McWilliams in the sixth on Jose Gonzalez's bunt single -- a pitch that hit Huff 
in the arm -- and a walk to Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Valenzuela leaned over the plate against the left-handed 
McWilliams and grounded a ball into right field to score two runs and start the 
rout. In bases-loaded situations this season, Valenzuela is two for two with 
four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen pitchers go up there afraid to bat, or just spread their legs and 
hack," Dodger batting coach Ben Hines said. "But just watch Fernando and you 
can tell he's a good hitter." Valenzuela, who has four hits in his last six 
at-bats to improve his average to .160, shrugged. "Anybody with any kind of bat 
in their hand, that person can be dangerous," he said. "Anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Some more than others, such as Marshall, who has hit in 14 of his last 15 games 
(19 for 61, .311). 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt better, never," Marshall said. "It sounds crazy, but since 
coming back from the back problems, I've been forced to have more discipline, 
to worry about mechanics. When all that is working, the back is not bothering 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to finish playing every game for the rest of the year, and then start 
out playing every game next year. I feel right now like I can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger third baseman Tracy Woodson, who left the triple-A Albuquerque 
team last week and has not returned, has been placed on the temporary inactive 
list. The Dodgers will not pay him, while hoping he decides to rejoin the 
organization. . . . Part of Thursday's pregame meeting was devoted to published 
comments from anonymous players concerning their alleged anger over the absence 
of Kirk Gibson, who is in Michigan awaiting Aug. 25 knee surgery. Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda demanded that the anonymous sources speak up at the 
meeting. Nobody spoke.

holes to tie Jay Sigel Thursday, giving Britain and Ireland a 12 1/2-11 1/2 
victory over the United States in the 32nd Walker Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first win on U.S. soil for the British-Irish team and ended a string 
of eight consecutive American victories in this biennial international golf 
series. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans had won five singles matches Thursday afternoon and appeared on 
the verge of overcoming an 11-5 deficit after the morning foursomes until Sigel 
lost the day's finalmatch. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan, 25, chipped in for a birdie to square the match on the 17th hole 
after winning the 16th when Sigel bogeyed. Both players bogeyed the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. lead in the series was cut to 28-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The British-Irish team needed strong comebacks from Eoghan O'Connell and Andrew 
Hare to avoid blowing the big lead and to set the stage for Milligan's victory. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell, trailing by one hole with two to play, got even when Phil Mickelson 
bogeyed the 17th hole. The players then halved the match with par fours on No. 
18, with Mickelson sinking an eight-foot putt and O'Connell getting a one-foot 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell is an Irishman who plays golf at Wake Forest. Mickelson won the NCAA 
championship this year as a freshman at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Hare had to win the last two holes to even his match with Doug Martin, who led 
Oklahoma to the NCAA team title this year.

Doug Tewell may have the inside track on solving the peculiar format that 
confused and mystified some of golf's leading pros Thursday in the first round 
of the $1-million International tournament at Castle Rock, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"You find yourself thinking, 'Now what is it I'm trying to do?' " Hale Irwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Stadler may have put it in focus when he walked off the 18th green at the 
Castle Pines Golf Club and said: "I don't know what I shot. And I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
His attitude is understandable in an event where medal scores don't count, the 
lead through the first three days of play is completely meaningless and Tewell 
figured out a way he may be able to make a double bogey work to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament uses a modified Stableford scoring system in which a player's 
medal score has no bearing. Points are awarded for eagles (5) and birdies (2), 
and points are subtracted for bogeys (-1) and double bogeys and higher (-3). 
Only the player's point total counts. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the field was cut after each round and there was no carryover of 
point totals from one round to another. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the 150-man field is scheduled to play two rounds, with 
points carried over from Thursday to today, before the 72 players with the 
highest point totals advance to Saturday's play. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, they will all start from zero again, competing for 24 places in 
Sunday's final round, when the field again will start from zero. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Westner of South Africa led the first-day point-getters with 16. 
</P>
<P>
Price, Bill Britton, Brad Fabel and Bob Gilder had 12 points apiece. Steve 
Elkington of Australia had 11, and Tewell and Corey Pavin each had 10. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell said his 10-point total may be too much. 
</P>
<P>
"How are they going to pair us for Saturday? Will they pair by scores?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do, and I get another eight or 10 points tomorrow, I may have to start 
thinking about making a couple of double bogeys to get the total down and get 
an earlier starting time when the wind doesn't blow so much and the greens 
aren't spiked up," Tewell said. 
</P>
<P>
Would he purposely make bogey or double bogey to arrive at a more advantageous 
starting time? 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "For this much money (total purse of $1 million, with $180,000 to 
the winner) I might have to think about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus had eight points, Greg Norman five. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Peete shot a six-under-par 65 to take the lead after the two rounds of a 
$256,000 tournament at Chepstow, Wales. 
</P>
<P>
Peete's round earned him 42 points under the Stableford scoring system being 
employed at the Welsh tournament. He had 35 points in the first round and held 
the lead with 77. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Mason of England and Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe were tied for second place, 
a point behind Peete.

<P>
Vijay Amritraj couldn't handle Boris Becker's powerful serve, so Becker gave 
him a break, but it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
After three straight aces, Becker served an underhanded ace to the 35-year-old 
Amritraj while scoring a 6-1, 6-1 victory Thursday in the third round of the 
ATP Championships at Mason, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had tougher matches," the top-seeded Becker said. "He realized that I was 
just a little better today than he was, (and) we both started to come down a 
little bit and have a little more fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I was no more focused than usual. If I can beat a guy easily, I try to beat 
them easily. Most of the time people do not let me beat them easily. But from 
time to time, I'm having a good time hitting the ball, and the easy wins 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, third-seeded Mats Wilander beat fellow Swede Niclas Kroon, 
6-4, 6-2; second-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden outlasted Ramesh Krishnan of 
India, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3; and fourth-seeded Michael Chang defeated 14th-seeded Jim 
Courier, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Also, fifth-seeded Brad Gilbert struggled past Pete Sampras, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 
6-4; and eighth-seeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru turned back Martin Davis, 6-4, 2-6, 
7-6 (7-2); No. 12 Andres Gomez of Ecuador knocked off sixth-seeded Aaron 
Krickstein, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, and 10th-seeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden downed Gary 
Muller of South Africa, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Pereira, 18, of Venezuela, surprised fourth-seeded Tim Mayotte, 6-3, 
1-6, 6-3, in the Canadian Open at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira, ranked 121st in the world, also ousted 14th-seeded Todd Witsken in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
In another upset, 12th-seeded Andrew Sznajder of Canada beat fifth-seeded Kevin 
Curren, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, top-seeded Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia struggled before 
defeating No. 16 Jimmy Arias, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4; second-seeded John McEnroe beat 
Richey Reneberg, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), and third-seeded Andre Agassi beat Kelly 
Evernden of New Zealand, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Jay Berger downed Sammy Giammalva, 6-3, 7-5; Grant Connell of 
Canada defeated Jonathan Canter, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, and Alex Antonitsch of Austria 
outlasted Diego Nargiso of Italy, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Arantxa Sanchez of Spain was in a struggle with Betsy Nagelsen when 
darkness halted their match at 6-1, 4-6 in a Virginia Slims tournament at 
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, fifth-seeded Lori McNeil defeated Claudia Porwikof of West 
Germany, 6-3, 7-5; seventh-seeded Anne Minter of Australia beat Elise Burgin, 
6-3, 6-2, and sixth-seeded Amy Frazier downed Jana Pospisilova of 
Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-3.

acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. and continuing problems predicting demand 
for its products, the firm said. Without the $476.4-million acquisition of 
Apollo, profit would have risen 15%, the firm said. Revenue, helped by an

triple the profit it made in the 1988 period, on revenue of $82.2 million, a

STOCKS FALL IN HEAVY TRADING; DOW OFF 13.66

<P>
Concern about interest rates shook the stock market Thursday and sent prices 
down in the busiest day this week. 
</P>
<P>
The drop came in response to a sharp decline in the bond market after release 
of the June U.S. trade deficit report. The numbers showed a surprising 
narrowing of the deficit that suggested underlying strength in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 13.66 to finish at 2,679.63, after 
trading down about 25 points during the session. Last Thursday, the Dow Jones 
index closed at 2,712.63, near the all-time high of 2,722.42 reached in August, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones transportation average gained 26.67 to set another record at 
1,428.34, largely because of takeover speculation in airline stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 887 issues down, 561 up and 540 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 157.56 million shares, up from 150.06 million 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that the June U.S. trade deficit narrowed to 
$8.17 billion from a revised $10.08 billion in May. The improvement resulted 
mainly because of a 1.5% increase in exports to a record $30.91 billion while 
imports fell 3.6% to $39.08 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The stock and bond markets initially rallied after the report, which eased 
recession worries. But closer inspection aroused bondholders' concern that the 
economy is too strong and that the Federal Reserve might not ease credit 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
What should have been interpreted as good news for the overall economy was bad 
news for the market, said Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache 
Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is concerned that if the economy is too bubbly the Fed will not 
accommodate and lower interest rates," Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Wall Street analysts said, however, that the market was overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
Among most actively traded issues on the NYSE, UAL Corp., parent of United 
Airlines, rose 14 5/8 to 266 3/8 on news that billionaire suitor Marvin Davis 
raised his bid to $275 a share, or $6.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines rose 1 to 75 1/4, Continental Bank gained 1/4 to 25 and 
AT&amp;T rose 1/4 to 39 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, fell 1 1/2 to 51, Navistar lost 1/4 to 4 7/8 and 
Bristol Meyers dropped 1/8 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stock prices closed barely firmer but managed to post a record closing 
high despite light summer volume. The Nikkei 225-share index rose only 5.96 to 
close at a record 35,090.11. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices briefly reached 1989 highs during the trading day on London's 
Stock Exchange, partly in response to better-than-expected U.S. trade figures. 
The Financial Times 100-share index ended up 14.2 at 2,360.0. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell as a result of fresh evidence of continuing economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond dropped 9/16 point, or $5.60, for 
every $1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 8.16% from 8.11% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices were hurt by the trade report and a decline in 
initial claims for state unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York, said the decline 
in unemployment applications "makes people in the market nervous about 
strengthening of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
He said the declining trade deficit, which was helped by a 1.5% increase in 
U.S. exports to a record level of $30.91 billion, makes it less likely that the 
Fed will relax its credit policy, driving interest rates lower and bond prices 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished above the day's lows, however, as some traders bought 
bonds late in the day in an effort to square their holdings before today's 
scheduled report on consumer prices in July. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.875%, down from 8.938% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose sharply worldwide, bolstered by the better-than-expected trade 
report, but its gains were capped by profit taking and uncertainty over whether 
the upward momentum can continue. 
</P>
<P>
The rise brought the dollar back almost to the highs reached in June, the 
period of its most recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery gained 10 cents to close at $368.30 an ounce. Republic 
National Bank of New York said quoted a late bid of $366.20, down from $366.50 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency began gaining ground after the release of the trade deficit 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Profit taking at home and abroad as well as rumors of intervention took the 
dollar down from its peak levels in hectic trading. 
</P>
<P>
"The variables here are the central banks," said Ian Spence, chief dealer at 
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. "There's a lot of uncertainty over whether the 
dollar will go much higher." 
</P>
<P>
Traders also were looking to today's release of the consumer price index for 
July for further evidence that economic growth is continuing and that monetary 
policy need not be altered. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar firmed to 142.32 Japanese yen from 142.20 late 
Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar traded sharply higher at 143.95 yen. In 
New York, the dollar closed at 143.53 yen, up from 142.19 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.5590 late Thursday, cheaper than 
Wednesday's $1.5735. In New York, one pound cost $1.5605, less expensive than 
$1.5805 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of copper futures rocketed higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
extending to seven days a rally fueled by miners strikes, tightening supplies, 
bullish chart signals and signs of renewed economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, soybeans for August delivery tumbled, energy futures were 
lower, most livestock and meat futures advanced before a government cattle 
report and precious metals were narrowly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 2.9 to 4.5 cents higher on heavy volume, with the contract for 
delivery in August at $1.2675, the highest settlement of a spot contract since 
May 5. The more active September contract settled at $1.2625, which represents 
a 15% gain since Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Copper prices reached a record high of $1.6475 a pound last Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Prices initially rose Thursday after the Commodity Exchange's report that 
stocks of copper stored for delivery against futures contracts had dropped by 
1,140 tons Wednesday to 16,708 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Traders follow the daily Comex stocks reports as an indicator of overall 
supplies. Wednesday's sharp drawdown reinforced fears that miners strikes in 
Peru and Canada, as well as production problems in other copper-rich nations, 
are cutting into supplies as the seasonal peak demand period -- which begins in 
the fall and ends in the early spring -- approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the September contract pierced considerable technical resistance 
at $1.23 a pound, bringing in further buying that brought it to within about 5 
cents of its lifetime high of $1.3150, reached on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. said the rally was almost entirely 
technically inspired, but he also cited the Commerce Department's report of a 
strong improvement in the trade deficit. The report signals economic strength, 
a key component of copper demand. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans for August delivery fell 15.5 cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of 
Trade in a selloff sparked by ideas that the Italian grain giant Ferruzzi 
Finanziaria S.p.A. was liquidating some large holdings. The contract settled at 
$6.08 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling of soybean contracts Thursday by trading companies with close 
ties to Ferruzzi prompted a flurry of selling by others seeking to profit from 
the drop in prices that a large-scale selloff by Ferruzzi could cause. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1.5 to 2.75 cents lower, with September at $3.9725 a bushel; corn 
was 2.25 cents lower to 0.75 cent higher, with September at $2.3575 a bushel; 
oats were 0.50 cent to 1.5 cents lower, with September at $1.37 a bushel, and 
soybeans were 15.5 cents lower to 6 cents higher, with the September contract 
at $5.84 a bushel.

CONTROLS OF TOXIC NON-VEHICULAR EMISSIONS NEED NOT WAIT FOR STATE ACTION, COURT

<P>
Citing the need for prompt action to protect the environment, the state Supreme 
Court on Thursday upheld the power of local air pollution districts to control 
toxic emissions from factories and other stationary sources of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a unanimous decision, struck down a state Court of Appeal 
ruling that had barred a local district from identifying and controlling toxic 
substances before the state Air Resources Board had done so. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities and health and environmental groups from throughout 
California joined in urging the high court to overturn the appellate ruling, 
warning that it could all but eliminate local efforts to combat non-vehicular 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 9 Pollutants Acted On 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's decision, the justices noted that in six years the state board 
had acted on only nine such pollutants -- while scores of other substances had 
been recognized in the scientific community as potentially harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for state action would "for all practical purposes eliminate 
non-vehicular air pollution control regulation in this state," Justice David N. 
Eagleson wrote for the court. "Many years, perhaps decades, may pass before the 
board will be able to study, identify and regulate the hundreds of substances 
discharged into the air." 
</P>
<P>
The court pointed out that in Los Angeles County alone, industries released 
nearly 30 million pounds of hazardous chemicals into the air in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It is "inconceivable" that the Legislature, in enacting air pollution statutes, 
intended to alter the long-held authority of local districts to control 
non-vehicular emissions, Eagleson said. He noted that the board itself had 
urged the court to reaffirm the power of local authorities to curb new sources 
of industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The decision represented a major victory for the Monterey Bay Unified Air 
Pollution Control District, which had sought to implement a sweeping, 
precedent-setting plan to control nearly 150 toxic air contaminants from new or 
modified stationary facilities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel P. Selmi, a Loyola Law School professor who represented the district, 
welcomed Thursday's ruling, saying the Monterey plan now may "serve as a model" 
for similarly expansive efforts by other local districts in California. "This 
is an important reaffirmation of the ability of local districts to control 
toxic contaminants," Selmi said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Ramo, legal director for Citizens for a Better Environment, one of the 
groups supporting the district, called the ruling "a crucial decision for air 
toxics regulation in California." Now, Ramo said, "local districts can regulate 
the thousands of uncontrolled toxic chemicals in the air." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit by Oil Interests 
</P>
<P>
Donna R. Black of Los Angeles, an attorney for the Western States Petroleum 
Assn., a group of producers and refiners who had brought suit challenging the 
Monterey regulations, expressed disappointment with the ruling and voiced 
concern that it could result in inconsistent and conflicting regulations in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a good argument in this case," Black said. "We contended 
such controls should be implemented uniformly, rather than on a piecemeal 
basis. But that's about the only result that can come out of this ruling." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case noted that while important, the ruling would not directly 
affect the recently state-approved, 20-year plan by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District to improve air quality in the Los Angeles Basin. That plan 
is being developed to bring the region into compliance with federal air 
pollution standards. 
</P>
<P>
At issue before the high court was a milestone state law known as the Tanner 
Act that was adopted in 1983 out of growing concern over the potential risk of 
cancer, birth defects and genetic abnormalities from air pollution. The act 
established an elaborate process for the state Air Resources Board, working 
with health officials, to identify non-vehicular, toxic pollutants and then 
design rules to combat them. 
</P>
<P>
Local districts were to adopt regulations at least as strict as those of the 
board. As in the past, the board retained its responsibility for control of 
vehicular pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey authorities, dissatisfied with the pace of board action, adopted their 
own far-reaching plan to identify and control toxic emissions in 1986. To 
obtain a permit to operate, emission-producing facilities were required to 
install "reasonable" technology to control contaminants -- and if those 
pollutants could cause cancer, the "best" technology was required. 
</P>
<P>
The petroleum association filed suit to block the plan, arguing that under the 
1983 act, local authorities could not implement regulations until the state 
board identified the contaminants as toxic and issued minimum standards for 
their control. Allowing any of the state's 41 local districts to adopt plans 
could result in a conflicting patchwork of regulations throughout California, 
the association warned. 
</P>
<P>
A Monterey County Superior Court judge upheld the plan but last year an appeals 
court in San Jose ruled the district exceeded its authority by moving against 
the contaminants before they had been cited as toxic by the state. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the state high court reviewed the 1983 act and concluded 
that there was no indication the Legislature meant to repeal the 
long-established authority of local districts to control industrial pollution. 
While the Monterey district was the first to adopt such a sweeping plan, other 
districts in the state have long imposed similar conditions on new sources of 
pollution under local permit systems, the court noted. 
</P>
<P>
The additional fact that the Air Resources Board itself supported the local 
district's contention must be given "great weight" in resolving the issue, the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
If the association's contentions were upheld, "the practical result . . . would 
be the absence in the foreseeable future of essentially all non-vehicular air 
pollution control regulation in California," Eagleson wrote. "Non-vehicular 
sources could emit, in the interim, unrestricted amounts of almost all known 
substances, even those generally believed by the scientific community to pose 
serious health risks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Sentence Upheld 
</P>
<P>
In other action Thursday, the justices unanimously upheld the death sentence of 
Constantino Carrera, now 27, convicted in the 1982 murders of a married couple 
who managed a motel in Mojave. The victims, Jack and Carol Hayes, died from 
dozens of stab wounds. The ruling marked the 59th time the court has affirmed 
the death penalty in 83 capital rulings issued since the defeat of Chief 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other court members in the 1986 election. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in a brief order, also refused to hear an appeal from an Oakland 
parent contending that under the 1982 anti-crime initiative, school districts 
may be held liable for failing to protect students from campus violence. A 
state Court of Appeal ruled last spring that the "safe schools" provision of 
Proposition 8, the Victims' Bill of Rights, provides only a "general" right to 
safety and that any steps to enforce that right must be implemented by the 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the high court let stand an appellate ruling upholding the 
involuntary manslaughter conviction of a Contra Costa County woman who failed 
to seek medical help for a man who died from a heroin overdose suffered in her 
home.

AZT FOUND TO DELAY AIDS IN THOSE FREE OF SYMPTOMS 
</P>

<P>
Announcing a significant advance in the battle against AIDS, federal health 
officials said Thursday that the antiviral drug AZT has been shown to delay 
onset of the disease in certain groups of infected patients who have not yet 
developed symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have learned . . . provides real hope for the millions of people 
worldwide who are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)," said 
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan. "We are indeed entering 
the period when AIDS may become a treatable disease." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just two weeks after another AZT study showed that the 
drug arrests the progression of the disease in individuals experiencing initial 
symptoms of infection. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the findings could benefit about 600,000 of the estimated 1.5 million 
infected individuals in this country, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief of AIDS activities for the National Institutes of 
Health, said the AZT findings have "the broadest impact" of any of the 
therapeutic advances shown in recent years to prolong the lives of patients 
with AIDS or HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
Fauci said the findings are an important step toward the goal of moving AIDS 
from "an inevitably fatal disease" to "a disease that can be controlled over 
time" through early treatment after infection. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sullivan said, the latest information "underlines anew the need for 
people to voluntarily undergo HIV testing and counseling" so they can fully 
benefit from treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Every person who has reason to believe or suspect that he or she has been 
exposed to the virus should seek testing and counseling," Sullivan said. He 
also cautioned that "AZT is not a cure and, indeed, even those who are under 
AZT treatment remain capable of transmitting the disease." 
</P>
<P>
AZT, or zidovudine, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 
for the treatment of fully developed AIDS. The two recent studies present the 
first real evidence that the drug can be effective in the earliest stages of 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest study, infected individuals who had impaired immune systems but 
no symptoms and who took AZT developed AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex at 
half the rate of those who took a medically inert placebo. 
</P>
<P>
The study -- the largest AIDS clinical trial ever conducted -- began two years 
ago and was coordinated by Paul Volderding, an AIDS specialist at San Francisco 
General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The trial compared high and low doses of AZT against a placebo in 3,200 people 
who were infected with the virus but had not developed symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,200 volunteers, 1,300 initially had abnormally low counts of T4 cells 
in their blood, indicating that their immune systems had been damaged. Those 
participants had fewer than 500 T4 cells per cubic millimeter of blood, 
contrasted with a normal range of 800 to 1,200. T4 cells are the primary 
targets of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,300 participants with low T4 cell counts were divided equally into three 
groups. One group received a medically worthless placebo; a second group 
received a high dose of AZT, and the third group was given a low dose of the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
In the placebo group, 38 individuals developed AIDS or severe AIDS-related 
complex, contrasted with only 17 in the low-dose AZT group and 19 in the 
high-dose AZT group. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an independent board of scientists monitoring the study decided 
that the placebo arm of the trials should be halted for participants with low 
T4 cell counts and that those people should be offered AZT because of its 
potentially therapeutic effects. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the three-group approach will continue for participants whose T4 
counts are above 500, "since the study has shown that short-term risk of 
developing AIDS is negligible in persons with higher T4 counts." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said progression of the disease was about the same in patients 
receiving the low dose of 500 milligrams of AZT per day or the higher dose of 
1,500 milligrams per day. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing the study results of two weeks ago, they said that side effects 
associated with AZT were minimal, indicating that the drug can be better 
tolerated early in the disease. AZT has proved to be extremely toxic in many 
people with fully developed AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Although the results of both studies were dramatic, officials emphasized that 
AZT is not considered an AIDS cure and it remains unclear how long the disease 
can be slowed or delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Although AIDS organizations, lawmakers and others cheered the results of the 
latest study, many expressed concern that AZT -- which can cost a patient from 
$8,000 to $12,000 a year -- will be inaccessible to many who need it. 
</P>
<P>
"This announcement is great news for those people with good insurance," said 
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health. "We have to find a way to get this drug to all who need 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said he ordered the Medicare system Thursday to begin reimbursing for 
AZT, although it is unclear who would benefit from the directive. Medicare is 
available only to individuals older than 65, final-stage kidney disease 
patients and those who have been disabled for 29 months under Social Security 
regulations. Fully developed AIDS is considered a disability, but AIDS 
infection is not. 
</P>
<P>
The administration of AZT, which is manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Co. of 
Research Triangle Park, N.C., is not covered by all private health insurance 
programs and is covered by Medicaid only under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"This research news is tremendously encouraging," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council, said the news 
"marks a major turning point in the AIDS epidemic. For the first time, there is 
hope at the asymptomatic stage that progression to serious AIDS manifestations 
may be delayed."

U.S. AGENCIES TO SUBMIT PLANS FOR 5% CUT IN '91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In an early indication of Bush Administration budget strategy, Budget Director 
Richard G. Darman has sent a letter to all federal agency chiefs requiring them 
to develop plans for absorbing a 5% cut in funding in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions would be reflected in one of three budget proposals that Darman 
asked each agency head to submit. Fiscal 1991 does not begin until Oct. 1, 
1990, but key decisions about the cuts will be made over the next few months, 
with agencies required to submit their proposals by Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The memo does not cover defense spending and exempts entitlement programs such 
as Social Security. But Darman suggested that agency directors might also want 
to propose cuts in entitlement programs as a way of financing any new or 
increased spending. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 budget will be "a major policy document" for the Administration, a 
senior budget official said Thursday, because it will be the first budget that 
Bush and his aides develop on their own. And it is being drawn up under severe 
constraints as Bush tries to meet deficit-reduction targets without violating 
his no-new-taxes pledge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deficit Goals Unmet 
</P>
<P>
So far, budget agreements between the Administration and Congress would not 
come close to meeting the 1991 deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman 
balanced-budget law, and "it will therefore be necessary to present the 
President with options for further spending reductions," Darman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, distributed to department and agency heads earlier this summer, marks 
a distinct change from the traditional method of developing the 
Administration's annual budget proposal. In the past, federal agencies have 
submitted budget plans to the Office of Management and Budget in the fall. OMB 
officials then typically have tried to pare down the requests. 
</P>
<P>
Under Darman's plan, agencies will be required to develop budget cut proposals 
at the beginning of the process, a move expected to strengthen the OMB's hand 
in the inevitable squabbling between agencies and the budget office over 
spending levels. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to an agency's normal budget request, Darman wrote, all agencies 
will be required to submit two additional budget plans. One would accommodate a 
freeze in non-defense spending other than that for entitlement programs. The 
second would require a 5% cut from fiscal 1990 spending levels. 
</P>
<P>
The budget-cutting plans are being driven by the targets set four years ago in 
the Gramm-Rudman law, under which the federal deficit in 1991 is not supposed 
to exceed $64 billion. For 1990, the deficit is supposed to be kept below $110 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Hike Foreseen 
</P>
<P>
Both Congress and the Administration have found many ways to slip around those 
budget targets. Even so, meeting the 1990 target required extensive 
negotiations this spring. Cutting the deficit by an additional $50 billion to 
meet the 1991 target without increasing taxes will be difficult. Many 
congressional leaders predict that Bush will have to propose a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials continue to argue that a tax increase will not be 
necessary, although Bush has been careful not to commit himself on how long his 
no-new-taxes pledge will last. The process of drawing up the 1991 budget 
proposal, which Bush will submit to Congress in January, is expected to 
dominate the Administration's agenda for the fall.

SOVIET PLAN FOR MINORITIES: DEBATE ALONG WITH CURBS

<P>
The Soviet leadership Thursday proposed "radical transformations" in the 
Kremlin's dealings with that nation's 15 republics and suggested that ethnic 
minorities who oppose Soviet laws be permitted to "question" them before a high 
court. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the country's leaders, in a sweeping policy statement, 
sought to put general limits on how far activists can go in pressing for 
minority rights. It suggested a new law banning "nationalist and chauvinist 
organizations," an apparent reference to groups organized in many of the 
republics to agitate for change. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party statement offered few concrete suggestions on how to deal 
with the increasingly acute problem of ethnic strife, which has resulted in the 
deaths of about 200 people over the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the intent of the document, printed on 1 1/2 pages in Pravda, the 
Communist Party newspaper, appeared to be to create an atmosphere of compromise 
so that the issue of ethnic relations can be calmly discussed at a plenary 
session of the party's Central Committee that is expected to be held next 
month. Suggestions contained in the document will be considered then. 
</P>
<P>
However, unless practical proposals are raised and approved at that plenum, one 
Western analyst warned Thursday, new and more serious unrest is likely because 
it will appear to minority groups as though the long-dominant Russian majority 
is willing to talk about their rights -- but not to act. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said that the problem of interethnic 
hostility threatens the very existence of his federation of 286 million people. 
</P>
<P>
But previous efforts by Gorbachev to soothe tempers and end ethnic protests -- 
including the sending of Red Army troops to trouble spots and appealing to the 
nation personally on nationwide television -- have failed to prevent trouble 
from cropping up in many of that nation's republics. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, minority groups have agitated for freedoms ranging from the 
right to fly nationalist flags to the right to split from the nation and form 
independent states. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most significant concessions to date, the Kremlin granted a 
measure of economic autonomy to the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia. They are among the most embittered over central control imposed by 
Moscow and among the most active in pursuing ethnic rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party document released Thursday said rights given to republics 
so far should be expanded, and it noted that the party seeks to guarantee "free 
development of the spiritual life of all peoples of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, it said, "independence of republics was curtailed under the 
pretext of the protection of the interests of the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
"Now that Soviet society has embarked on major radical reforms, we need to 
ensure free national development, enhance the interethnic unity of society and 
consolidate our multi-ethnic Soviet state," the document said. 
</P>
<P>
In a decisive break with the past, the statement dismissed the long-held 
Bolshevik goal of blurring ethnic distinctions to create a new "Soviet man." 
Instead, it argued that the uniqueness of each culture should be valued. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Communist Party proceeds from the recognition of the originality of 
national cultures, their unique value. . . . Harmonizing inter-ethnic relations 
on a new basis is one of the supreme goals of the Communist Party's 
nationalities policy," the statement said. It added that it is time for 
"radical transformations in the Soviet federation." 
</P>
<P>
The document proposed that republics be permitted to "raise the question" of 
rejecting national laws that they believe exceed the authority of the central 
government. The contested laws then would be considered by the Constitutional 
Control Commission, a new high court created last year. 
</P>
<P>
In return, it said, the central government would have the power to cancel 
unconstitutional laws passed in republics. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, although adhering to mild language, also warned: "The 
heightening of national awareness should be distinguished from nationalism." 
</P>
<P>
"A citizen of the republic is simultaneously a citizen of the Soviet Union," it 
said in what appeared to be a warning to activists in Georgia and the Baltic 
states who have demanded outright secession from the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving privileges to some people and limiting the rights of others for reasons 
of nationality, religion, language or duration of residence is impermissible," 
the document added. 
</P>
<P>
The latter was a clear reference to recent conflicts in Estonia, where the 
ethnic Russian minority has been striking for more than a week to protest a law 
passed by the republic's legislature limiting the voting rights of newly 
settled immigrants. Many of the Russians in Estonia are newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet -- the executive body of the 
Soviet national legislature -- declared the Estonian residence requirement 
unconstitutional, and the Estonian Parliament agreed to reconvene by Oct. 1 to 
reconsider the law. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, ethnic Russians in Moldavia staged a two-hour "warning 
strike" to protest a bill that would make Moldavian the official language in 
the southwestern Soviet republic. A similar law already is in place in Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party policy statement, while not referring to any specific area 
of conflict, urged in general that minorities seeking to expand their rights 
demonstrate tolerance and patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet citizens should feel at home in any area of the country," the policy 
statement read. "Such is the supreme and final goal of all work to harmonize 
inter-ethnic relations."

OWENS VALLEY RESIDENTS TOIL TO REOPEN L.A.'S WATER SPIGOT

It's not that Jim Snead bad-mouths Los Angeles. Still, it's pretty clear that 
he doesn't care much for the big city 180 miles south of here, at least not as 
a place to live. He tried it, didn't like it and got out. 
</P>
<P>
"Couldn't stand the freeways," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
That was 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But like plenty of people in the Owens Valley, Snead is an example of how you 
can take the boy out of the city, but you can't take the city out of the boy. 
Every payday, Snead and about 250 other Owens Valley residents feel a special 
allegiance to Los Angeles. What the metropolis gets in return, under normal 
circumstances, is water. 
</P>
<P>
Snead is maintenance superintendent for the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, and these are not normal circumstances -- not for Los Angeles, not for 
Snead, not for Olancha. This speck of a town in the sagebrush nothingness along 
U.S. 395 is where nature punished civilization last week with a freak summer 
storm that moved millions of tons of the Sierra Nevada down the eastern slope, 
burying the artificial river that made Los Angeles what it is today. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the flash flood hit the night of Aug. 8, it's been up to Snead and 
his cohorts to dig the Los Angeles Aqueduct out from under 15 feet of mud, 
granite boulders and the occasional splintered pine. A crew of 110 workers have 
been toiling round-the-clock to unplug the 76-year-old, 338-mile-long aqueduct 
that is supposed to supply Los Angeles with 75% of its water. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Los Angeles has been sating its 750-million-gallon-a-day thirst 
mostly with water stored in reservoirs south of the aqueduct. The DWP also 
temporarily increased its intake from the Metropolitan Water District from 250 
million gallons a day to 350 million gallons. The MWD gets its water from the 
Colorado River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta state water project. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday or Tuesday, Snead expects to have the aqueduct flowing again. To 
laymen who witness the mile of muck, the schedule seems optimistic. But Snead 
is confident. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole purpose being here," he said, "is a day like this." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't wake up saying, 'God, I hope the aqueduct gets filled up with mud,' 
" said Mike Daughtry, a 27-year-old DWP worker from Independence. "But I like 
to see how hard I can hit it for how long." 
</P>
<P>
Daughtry had just finished a few hours of overtime on what was to be a 12-hour, 
all-night shift. Everyone has worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week since 
the morning after the flash flood hit, Snead said. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Olancha Creek comes out of the Sierra as a steady little brook and is 
channeled across the aqueduct on a 20-foot-wide concrete bridge called "an 
overhead." This time, Olancha Creek was several hundred yards wide. 
</P>
<P>
The night of Aug. 8, there wasn't much to do but assess the situation and get 
organized, Snead said. The first call of water spilling over U.S. 395 came at 7 
p.m. Within an hour, a DWP foreman was on the scene, and calls were placed to 
Los Angeles for more equipment and workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The aqueduct just disappeared," Snead said. "We knew it was down there because 
we left it there a couple of days before." 
</P>
<P>
At some places, the 15-foot deep channel held 30 feet of rocks and mud. The 
concrete-lined channel was not damaged, but "fossilized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst crisis on the aqueduct since a similar flash flood 20 years 
ago. A downpour Aug. 10 complicated matters, loosening concrete panels south of 
the mud slide and threatening the channel's structural integrity. If the 
aqueduct had been filled with water, the pressure would have prevented the rain 
from seeping between the earth and the concrete walls of the channel. 
</P>
<P>
The first morning, a command post was formed in an Inyo County road maintenance 
yard where the Olancha Volunteer Fire Department is based. A group of DWP heavy 
equipment operators came up from Los Angeles to work, their motor homes forming 
an impromptu suburb. They dubbed it "Sam's Town" in honor of Sam Bishelli, the 
truck and heavy equipment dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
By reputation, Owens Valley residents are said to resent the way Los Angeles 
city slickers took their water rights and built the aqueduct way back when. If 
folks here see cosmic justice in the way Olancha Creek stopped the mighty Los 
Angeles Aqueduct, Snead doesn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of hype," he said. "The response of the whole Valley -- people 
offering to help -- has been tremendous. We're all citizens of the county. We 
all pull together."

VAN DE KAMP SEEKS $13 MILLION TO COMBAT COCAINE TRAFFICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling for "a major expansion of the state's role in narcotics enforcement," 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced Thursday that he will seek $13 million 
for the creation of 14 investigative teams to combat cocaine trafficking by 
Colombian drug cartels and Los Angeles street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Bush Administration for making "blue-sky promises" but failing 
to commit additional drug-fighting resources to California, Van de Kamp said he 
will ask the Legislature to pay for 224 new state narcotics officers, analysts 
and auditors to be assigned to regional task forces based in Los Angeles and 
the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said he has lined up bipartisan support for the program, dubbed 
"CrackDown," which would begin Jan. 1. The $13 million would pay for the teams 
for six months, with the yearly cost reaching $22 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came one day after Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, considered the 
front-runner in the 1990 gubernatorial race, proposed a $4-billion federal bond 
program to finance the Bush Administration's anti-drug campaign, which is to be 
unveiled next month by drug czar William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate for governor, said he did not wait to see 
what Bennett proposes because he wants to get a bill that would provide the 
necessary funding passed by the Sept. 15 close of the legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard glowing promises before only to be disappointed," Van de Kamp 
said. "The cold, hard truth is we can no longer wait for federal action." 
</P>
<P>
Under his proposal, 114 peace officers and 110 civilian employees would be 
hired to staff nine teams -- six of them in Southern California. While those 
teams focus on major drug trafficking investigations, three other teams would 
investigate money laundering and two "mobile street-gang response teams" would 
help local officials combat "crack" cocaine sales by gangs in smaller cities 
and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
The teams would steer away from investigations of simple street sales in which 
officers, for instance, saturate a park and "make 100 arrests in an afternoon," 
Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's proposal follows two reports this year suggesting that 
Los Angeles is supplanting Miami as the nation's drug distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials concluded that while Miami remained the nation's favorite import 
point for the drug, about 40% of the cocaine entering the United States was 
being shipped to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a report released by U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said 
Los Angeles gang members are spreading their "crack" trade into every corner of 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Los Angeles, Van de Kamp displayed a chart showing 
that while the Federal Reserve's cash surplus has been declining in Miami, it 
has been rising sharply in Los Angeles since 1985, a trend believed to reflect 
cash deposits in banks by drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Another chart showed that Florida, during the same period, had more than twice 
as many federal and state drug agents as California, when measured against 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we have relied on the federal government to control international 
smuggling, California has traditionally been very weak in that area," Van de 
Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said his proposal is supported by law enforcement officials 
throughout the state, including Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and 
Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
He said the bill to provide the funding will be carried in the Senate by 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Valencia), the former Los Angeles police chief. Its Assembly co-authors are 
Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) and Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas).

VOWS 'TO DEFEND DREAM' OF FREEDOM, RACIAL EQUALITY; 
</P>
<P>
POWELL HONORS BLACKS WHO SERVED

Gen. Colin L. Powell, in his first public comments since he was chosen to head 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff last week, paid a moving tribute to the black 
servicemen and women who preceded him and said his job as the nation's most 
senior military officer will be "to defend the dream" of freedom and equality 
among races. 
</P>
<P>
"The real story is that, yes, I climbed well and I climbed hard, but that I 
climbed over the cliffs on the backs of those that went before," said Powell in 
a speech to the National Assn. of Black Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"But now that we're on top and looking over that cliff, there are still more 
rivers to cross," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
If his appointment is confirmed by the Senate, Powell will become the first 
black to hold the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The 52-year-old 
officer, now the commander of all U.S.-based American military forces, was the 
Ronald Reagan Administration's sixth national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spirited Applause 
</P>
<P>
Powell's tribute to black soldiers and sailors received spirited applause. He 
said that his appointment "never would have been possible without the 
sacrifices of those black soldiers who served this great nation in war for 
nearly 300 years previously." 
</P>
<P>
He lauded also the more than 4 million American servicemen and women he will 
lead. "They protect the dream. They deserve our support," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
But the general signaled that, like his predecessors, he may be conservative in 
advising the dispatch of U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
"We must never send them forth to freedom's defense unready or to the call of 
an uncertain trumpet," Powell said, referring to the prospect of flagging 
public and governmental support for future military commitments. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Powell offered qualified praise for the Soviet Union and 
words of caution about prospects for immediate success in the efforts of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to reform his nation's economic and political 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for in Central America, we even see Soviet foreign policy being more 
responsible," Powell said. "The Soviet Union has contributed in its own way to 
this quieter world." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that Gorbachev's "desperate effort to revitalize their economy so 
they can play in the next century" faces daunting obstacles. "What we are 
seeing is a process that will take years and decades, not months, to unfold," 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Powell stopped short of echoing the controversial views of Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney, who predicted earlier this year that Gorbachev would 
fail in his reforms and be replaced by a more hard-line Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Key Voice 
</P>
<P>
Powell would be the principal military adviser to Cheney and to President Bush, 
and a key voice in a presidential decision to commit forces to trouble spots 
abroad. His Senate confirmation hearings are expected to begin in early 
September. He would succeed Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, who became an Army officer 10 years after a presidential order ended 
segregation in the military, applauded the role that the armed forces have 
played in breaking down racial barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the military, you will see the kind of opportunity for 
advancement that doesn't exist in every part of our society," he said.

DESIGN FLAW CAN MAKE TRIDENT 2 EXPLODE BUT NAVY IS SURE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy said Thursday that its new Trident 2 missile -- envisioned as the most 
powerful and accurate nuclear weapon ever sent to sea -- has a basic design 
flaw that can cause it to explode seconds after it is launched from a submerged 
submarine. 
</P>
<P>
But Navy officials predicted that the problem will be fixed in time for the 
$35-billion program to meet its scheduled initial deployment next March. 
</P>
<P>
A Trident 2 test missile self-destructed Tuesday after its underwater launch 
from the submarine Tennessee. It was the second failure in three tests of the 
rocket, which is intended to be the mainstay of the sea-based portion of 
America's nuclear arsenal for the next 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman, said the missile apparently cannot withstand 
the intense water pressure of the launch. Both failures occurred as the 
missile's engines ignited just after it broke the surface of the ocean, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missile to Be Redesigned 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the weapon will be redesigned to overcome the flaw and that the 
Navy fully expects the missile to meet its original performance specifications. 
</P>
<P>
"We still believe in the program," Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said. 
"There's no reason to change our view of its importance, or that it ultimately 
will be successful, and hopefully on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
However, retired Rear Adm. Eugene J. Carroll Jr., deputy director of the 
private Center for Defense Information, said the Navy "may have to make changes 
that might be a compromise in terms of performance, (but) given enough money 
and enough time, this missile will be made to work." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Carroll, a frequent critic of the Pentagon, said the Trident 2 is 
the sixth submarine-launched missile to be developed over the last 30 years and 
that it is shocking that problems remain in the underwater phase. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem seems to reflect some failure to consider the information that 
they must have compiled in the launching of the earlier systems," Carroll said. 
"What we are seeing is a slippage in a system and increased cost for something 
that is already a $35-billion program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Problems Corrected 
</P>
<P>
Smith said design problems are not unusual in new weapons systems. The purpose 
of testing is to identify the flaws so they can be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
He said some problems detected in the first undersea firing in March already 
have been corrected. The missile was launched successfully Aug. 2 but failed in 
its third test Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Like all submarine missiles, the Trident 2 is propelled to the surface through 
30 to 40 feet of water by compressed gas. Shortly after it pops out of the 
water, its engines ignite to propel it to its target. 
</P>
<P>
When any submarine missile breaks the surface, it creates a plume of water that 
follows it into the air. Smith said the Trident 2, almost twice as heavy as 
previous submarine-launched rockets, produced more water pressure and a larger 
plume than had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no surprises about what happened in terms of the water plume and 
water pressure," Smith said. "These were just underestimated somewhat. The 
missile could not withstand the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy said the Trident 2, in its initial test in March, cartwheeled in the 
air and blew up because launch pressure had jammed a steering nozzle in the 
wrong position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electrical Cables Snapped 
</P>
<P>
It said a nozzle also appeared to be in the wrong position in the failure 
Tuesday. Beyond that, it said, electrical cables snapped and triggered the 
self-destruct procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier tests of the missile, conducted on land under controlled conditions, 
had been successful nearly every time. 
</P>
<P>
The Trident 2 will carry eight nuclear warheads. Its specifications call for 
sufficient power and accuracy to destroy a Soviet missile in a hardened 
underground silo 80% of the time. By contrast, the Trident 1 now in service has 
a 15% kill probability against hardened silos. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy plans to buy 899 Trident 2 missiles for about $40 million each. The 
missile's prime contractor is Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. in Sunnyvale, 
Calif.

121 REFUGEES IN HONG KONG FLY TO VIETNAM

A group of 121 Vietnamese returned Thursday to the land they fled, marking the 
largest voluntary repatriation of refugees from Hong Kong's teeming camps. 
</P>
<P>
Waving handkerchiefs and clutching bags packed with clothes and radios, they 
boarded a Boeing 737 at Hong Kong's airport and took off for Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the 46 men, 40 women, 17 boys and 18 girls will be taken to their 
hometowns and monitored by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoi's Communist government has said it will not prosecute those returning to 
the country, one of the poorest in Asia. U.N. officials reiterated Thursday 
that they would monitor the returning refugees closely. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, Hong Kong allowed all Vietnamese refugees the right to settle 
in the British colony if they could not emigrate to another country. But under 
a tough policy instituted in June, the government ruled out resettlement for 
new refugees unless they could prove they were escaping political persecution. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, about 38,300 Vietnamese have sailed to Hong Kong and are being 
housed in camps, detention centers and halfway houses in the crowded colony.

SEJM CONDEMNS 1968 CZECHOSLOVAK INVASION

The lower house of Poland's National Assembly on Thursday condemned the 1968 
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, echoing a move by Hungary and further 
straining relations between reformist and conservative East European states. 
</P>
<P>
"The intervention breached the inalienable right of every nation to 
self-determination and its natural desire for democracy, freedom and respect 
for human rights," the lower house, known as the Sejm, said in a resolution 
passed 335-1, with nine abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
Communist deputies overwhelmingly supported the resolution -- even though their 
former party leader, President Wojciech Jaruzelski, was Poland's defense 
minister at the time of the invasion and allowed Polish troops to take part in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, similar to one adopted last week by the Senate, also resembled a 
statement issued Wednesday by Hungary's Communist Party, whose leadership said 
it does not identify itself with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Aug. 
21, 1968. The invasion ended the "Prague Spring" reforms of Alexander Dubcek.

WHITE HOUSE WARY OF MEDDLING IN POLAND 
</P>

<P>
Senior White House officials, watching the suddenly shifting developments in 
Poland from this coastal village where President Bush began a late-summer 
vacation, sought Thursday to encourage the establishment of a non-Communist 
government in Warsaw while avoiding the appearance of meddling. 
</P>
<P>
"The sensitivities are everywhere," said one official. His statement reflected 
concern at senior levels that the continually emerging strength of the 
Solidarity-led opposition is a favorable development -- but one that also 
increases the fragility of Poland's political status. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not want to do anything or say anything to upset the apple cart . . . 
in terms of the progress they're making," White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher cautiously 
urged the Soviet Union to keep its hands off Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States has no evidence to indicate Soviet interference, he 
said, the history of Soviet-Polish relations gives reason for concern. 
</P>
<P>
"What about the Soviet attitude?" Boucher said. "That's where I would invoke 
history and other factors to say that the basic principle for us of 
non-interference applies for everyone else as well." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks raised, but did not mention directly, the specter of the Soviet 
military operations that crushed democratic movements in Hungary in 1956 and 
Czechoslovakia in 1968, even as Soviet reforms have propelled the related 
reforms in Poland this year. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who spent the morning aboard his twin-engine boat with two of 
his four sons and the afternoon on the golf course, did not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the disclosure that Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the 
former Communist Party leader, has approved steps that could lead to a 
non-Communist government leave "many unanswered questions." He said the White 
House would have "no direct comment until there is much clearer direction on 
what happens next." 
</P>
<P>
Another senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, remarked: 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is not backing away from the principles of democracy it has 
always espoused, but in terms of how they (the Poles) go about forming a new 
government -- that is not something for the United States to get involved in." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, speaking with reporters, said Bush had "no direct involvement" in 
the developments in Poland and had no contact with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev regarding the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said: "We do encourage and support the process of pluralism, and it 
appears that that is the general direction that they are aimed. Certainly, a 
non-Communist government would be a remarkable and history-making occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the encouragement that it is offering Poland, the Bush 
Administration will send to Congress next month proposed legislation that would 
make available $100 million for Poland and $25 million for Hungary. The 
President pledged this aid during his visits to Warsaw and Budapest last month. 
</P>
<P>
One senior official, speaking privately, said the U.S. government's approach is 
built around securing a change "that works." 
</P>
<P>
"If Solidarity takes over, you want some assurances that they can do it," he 
said. "If Jaruzelski stays, the trick is making sure Solidarity is involved. At 
the same time, you don't want to alienate the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have been clearly impressed with Lech Walesa's 
performance, with one senior aide commenting that the Solidarity movement 
leader "really has his head on straight."

A Qantas jumbo jet made aviation history Thursday by becoming the first 
commercial airliner to fly nonstop from London to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
The new $150-million Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 made the 11,156-mile journey 
in 20 hours, nine minutes, also setting a speed record. The plane made the 
journey with 23 people on board, as well as strict limitations on luggage. It 
carried 56,420 gallons of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Flights between Australia and London usually make one stop, and complete the 
trip in about 22 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The previous long-distance record was held by South African Airways, which flew 
a specially designed Boeing jet 10,281 miles from Seattle to Cape Town.

An man with a history of child abuse who held his wife and eight children 
hostage Thursday shot his spouse to death, then turned the gun on himself after 
a 6 1/2-hour standoff with police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Dang Cha Xiong, 35, a refugee from Laos, was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the wife was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The children were safe, said Deputy Police Chief Lucian Neely. He said the 
gunman apparently had played Russian roulette with his hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Dang, who reportedly was released from jail Thursday morning on an unspecified 
charge, had been involved in a long-standing feud with his wife's parents and 
was under court order to stay away from his family, Neely said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy chief said Dang had told officers during telephone negotiations that 
he would surrender. But police then heard four shots from inside the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Officers rushed the dwelling, finding the children unharmed in a front room and 
the couple in a rear bedroom. The wife was pronounced dead at Dameron Hospital 
in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Andy Jackson said officers went to the apartment in the Tyrolean 
Village District, north of downtown, after a 12-year-old boy escaped from the 
dwelling at 2:05 p.m. and reported the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"He escaped from the apartment and told us about it and that's why we went over 
there," Jackson said. The father "broke off negotiations about 5:25 p.m., but 
we got them started up again." 
</P>
<P>
The lieutenant did not say what precipitated the shootings and he did not 
immediately identify the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The boy told police that Dang had played Russian roulette with the hostages, 
apparently sticking a bullet in the chamber of his gun and clicking the trigger 
at random. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said Dang recently had been ordered by a local judge to stay away from 
his wife and children at the 1640 Tyrol Lane address. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the eight children were Dang's, police said. The youngsters were 
reported to be between 1 and 13 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
Last Jan. 30, five children were killed and 30 other people wounded on a 
Stockton school yard by a man who then shot himself to death.

IT'S ASHES TO ASHES FOR PERKS WHEN CONGRESSMEN DEPART

<P>
While Claude Pepper lived, his office was a five-room suite, among the best on 
Capitol Hill. With Pepper gone and no successor in place, his staff is winding 
up his work in two storerooms with an air shaft for a view. 
</P>
<P>
"Our quarters are so cramped, we figured the animal rights people would be 
protesting," said Rochelle Jones, longtime press secretary for the Florida 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
The experiences of Pepper's staff undoubtedly differ little from those of Reps. 
Jim Wright and Tony Coelho, who resigned, and Mickey Leland and Larkin Smith, 
who were killed in recent plane crashes. 
</P>
<P>
Pepper, the champion of the elderly, enjoyed the power and perks that grow with 
seniority, and his staff shared them, too. When he died, the perks died for his 
staff as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Over With' 
</P>
<P>
"When a member dies, it's over with," said Ray Colley, the deputy clerk of the 
House who supervises the transitions when a congressman leaves and another 
takes his place. 
</P>
<P>
When Pepper staffers returned from his funeral in June, there was a message 
from the clerk's office: The telephone should no longer be answered 
"Congressman Claude Pepper's office." It was to be "18th Congressional District 
of Florida." 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Jones recalls, a procession of congressmen and their 
staffs came by to look over Pepper's office, which was in a prime location in 
the Rayburn Office Building -- commensurate with his 27 years in the House. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really ghoulish people looking over the remains," Jones said. "Five 
different people put in a bid for the office." 
</P>
<P>
When congressional suites become vacant, other members bid on them and they are 
awarded on the basis of seniority. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors included congressmen and others who wanted post-death autographs 
on books and pictures -- before the automatic signing pen was put away. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the staff's concern about not being able to answer 'Sen. 
Pepper' but he's not Sen. Pepper any more," Colley said. Many old-timers on 
Capitol Hill still referred to Pepper as senator, since he served in the Senate 
for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Pepper perks were gone before the sun set on his grave. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a parking space in Rayburn that was just great -- a few steps from the 
elevator," Jones said. "One day I came in and found (Texas congressman) Jack 
Brooks using my parking space. It was my notification that the space was no 
longer mine." 
</P>
<P>
Pepper died May 30 at age 88. The funeral was June 5 in Florida. His 
congressional seat will be filled in a special election Aug. 29, but until then 
his staff takes care of district business. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, the Pepper staff was told to move into two rooms among 
storage spaces on the sixth floor of the Longworth House Office Building next 
door -- with a view of an air shaft. The move meant packing up the 
congressman's belongings, first for the office switch, then for transfer to the 
Federal Records Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Pepper was in office from 1962. He never threw away a piece of paper," Jones 
said. "I found personnel files of people who worked there in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rayburn office was filled with memorabilia. It was a living museum, 
pictures of Pepper with all the presidents he's known since Roosevelt, pictures 
of Pepper with celebrities. One wall was filled just with legislation he had 
participated in, from the cross-Florida barge canal to Social Security reform." 
</P>
<P>
Pepper's personal things, including the hundreds of pictures and dozens of pens 
from bill signings, will go to the Mildred and Claude Pepper Library at Florida 
State University in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
Pepper's office was assigned by the clerk's office to Rep. Dale E. Kildee 
(D-Mich.), who is in his seventh term. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very careful to answer the phone '18th Congressional District of 
Florida,' " Jones said. "There is usually a pause, then 'is this Congressman 
Pepper's office?' People still call up; they need help getting a visa; a 
year-old Medicare claim hasn't been paid." 
</P>
<P>
The staff toils on, winding up the Pepper era. 
</P>
<P>
"People have stopped answering our phone calls," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
That, in Washington, is the ultimate loss of power.

More than 100 angry senior citizens jeered Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) on 
Thursday and briefly blocked his car from leaving a meeting with community 
leaders opposed to his stance on the Comprehensive Health Care Act. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the crowd -- yelling, "Liar, Liar," "Impeach, Impeach" and "We won't 
forget at election time" -- followed Rostenkowski when he left his car and 
walked a block away while it was driven around the crowd. He then got back in 
the car, which drove off. 
</P>
<P>
During the walk, Rostenkowski did not acknowledge the gathering crowd. His only 
comment was: "I don't think they understand what's going on. That's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski appeared at a community center in the Northwest Side district that 
for 30 years has sent him to Congress, where he is chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He discussed his support for the catastrophic health care law during a private 
meeting with representatives of six organizations representing senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The catastrophic health insurance program would improve benefits for people now 
on Medicare, estimated to number 33 million Americans. Higher income retirees 
who pay most of the cost of the program have been lobbying the committee to 
spread the cost among all taxpayers, not just older citizens.

BILL WOULD REVOKE CASUAL DRUG USERS' LICENSES 
</P>

<P>
Assemblyman Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) announced Thursday that he will introduce 
anti-drug legislation that would penalize casual users by revoking professional 
and driver's licenses and would give the governor authority to divest state 
investments in countries "not exerting their best efforts to stem the flow of 
drugs" into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Condit, who is the Democratic candidate in a Sept. 12 special election to fill 
the 15th Congressional District seat vacated by the resignation of Rep. Tony 
Coelho (D-Fresno), was joined in announcing the legislation by Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, a Democratic candidate for state attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
Condit and Reiner acknowledged that the bill faces an uphill battle with only 
one month left in the current legislative session. The broad legislation would 
launch an assault in the war on drugs by substantially increasing penalties for 
first-time offenders and "hitting them where it hurts the most," Reiner said. 
"The casual or so-called recreational user of drugs has been given a free 
ride," Reiner said. The proposal would put an end to "the de facto 
decriminalization of drugs" that exists under the current system of light 
penalties for first offenders, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, professionals holding state licenses, such as physicians 
and barbers, would have those licenses suspended for up to one year, and 
elected officeholders would be forced to resign, if convicted of drug offenses. 
Convicted juvenile users and dealers would lose their driver's licenses until 
age 18 . 
</P>
<P>
On a broader scale, the legislation would permanently ban financial 
institutions convicted of laundering drug money from doing business in 
California. It would also give the governor authority to divest state 
investments in countries seen as uncooperative in stemming the flow of drugs 
into the United States.

The former head of U.S. laser weapons research said he was impressed by a 
Soviet laser he saw melt a piece of metal but added that neither superpower 
would consider the equipment state-of-the-art technology. John Hammond said the 
powerful "megawatt carbon dioxide" laser he witnessed along with a group of 
congressmen at a secretive branch of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy 
in Troitsk, near Moscow, once was thought to have potential military 
applications, but now other types of lasers are more promising. "This type of 
laser technology . . . does not have a lot of relevance to more strategic-type 
weapons such as SDI," he said, referring to the U.S. Strategic Defense 
Initiative.

Tamil guerrillas killed 24 Indian troops in a raid launched from a hospital 
they had occupied in northwest Sri Lanka, an Indian Embassy official said in 
Colombo, the capital. He said the rebels attacked the Mannar camp with gunfire 
and rocket-propelled grenades, and the Indian troops did not return fire out of 
consideration for the 87 civilians in the hospital. Guerrillas of the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said the Indian soldiers were killed when 
their commando unit overran the camp.

An official Soviet magazine published works by Leon Trotsky for the first time 
since the long-reviled former hero of the 1917 revolution was exiled and, in 
1940, assassinated in Mexico, presumably by agents of his archrival, Josef 
Stalin. Young Communist republished a series of Trotsky's articles called "The 
New Course," first printed in the party daily Pravda in 1923. The magazine said 
that publication of Trotsky's writing is "a step toward restoring him as an 
eloquent revolutionary and man of letters." President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
glasnost (openness) campaign has not rehabilitated Trotsky as it has other 
Communist Party members executed by Stalin's orders, but he is now treated as a 
historic figure.

Tens of thousands of Pakistanis marched miles to Faisal Mosque in Islamabad to 
mark the first anniversary of the death of President Zia ul-Haq and to protest 
the government of President Benazir Bhutto. Zia ruled Pakistan for 11 years, 
eight of them under martial law. His death in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17, 
1988, paved the way for the country's first free election in more than a 
decade, and Bhutto's party won control of the National Assembly. Pakistani 
Television estimated the crowd of Zia loyalists at 70,000.

The Irish Republican Army vowed to keep attacking British army bases across 
Europe and stretch Britain's resources and will to the breaking point. The IRA 
promised a "long, bloody summer" to mark the anniversary of the Aug. 14, 1969, 
deployment of British troops in Northern Ireland. But the anniversary passed 
without a single death in the sectarian and political conflict that has now 
taken almost 2,000 lives in Ulster. Britain's portrayal of the conflict as 
indigenous to Northern Ireland, an IRA spokesman said, has forced the 
organization to change tactics, "for example, going abroad to inflict higher 
casualties on British military forces."

Authorities in Newark, N. J., agreed to scale back drastically the amount of 
public housing to be demolished under a slum clearance plan and committed 
themselves to replacing the razed apartments. The agreement between the Newark 
Housing Authority and housing activists provides for the demolition of eight 
apartment buildings containing about 1,900 units, with 1,500 new apartments to 
be built and hundreds of others renovated. Tenants in buildings being 
demolished will be given a place immediately in a new building or a renovated 
apartment. The program is the biggest demolition of public housing by an 
American city. It is aimed at getting rid of what critics call "high-rise 
slums."

Using a sketch produced by a police artist, detectives in San Jose arrested a 
27-year-old alarm company employee on suspicion of raping and murdering a 
16-year-old Japanese exchange student. Investigators also said they believe 
that Gregory Calvin Smith is responsible for 17 other sex-related crimes in the 
area during the last six months. Ai Toyoshima, who came to the United States to 
learn English, was followed from a bus stop in June and fatally wounded. The 
teen-ager was able to describe her attacker before she died.

RESPIRATORY DISEASE DEATH RATE UP 33% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The emphysema and bronchitis death rate among Americans is up by a third since 
1979, with the highest rates in the West, and 4 out of 5 such deaths are caused 
by smoking, the national Centers for Disease Control said in Atlanta. The CDC 
said 71,099 Americans died of the diseases in 1986, the latest year for which 
complete statistics are available. The toll does not include lung cancer 
deaths. Although men's death rates remained higher than women's, the rate for

STATE WASTE BOARD WARNS COUNTY TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT 
</P>

<P>
The California Waste Management Board unanimously voted Thursday to strip Los 
Angeles County officials of their powers to enforce health and safety standards 
at 83 county trash dumps and transfer stations if county health officials do 
not toughen their approach during the next month. 
</P>
<P>
If the state board follows through with its action, it will be the first time 
since the board's 1973 formation that it has stripped an agency of local 
control, said board spokesman Chris Peck. 
</P>
<P>
The board's vote represented the toughest action it could take because state 
waste management laws require a 30-day notice before any powers can be taken 
away from local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman John E. Gallagher said he hoped the threat of such drastic 
action would be enough to persuade the county Department of Health Services to 
step up its enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just gone through a period of time where people thought we just 
rubber-stamped things," Gallagher said. "That just isn't true. Please take that 
message back with you, that we are dead serious about getting this thing 
straightened out." 
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, the board has become increasingly critical of the 
county department's activities, particularly concerning the Los 
Angeles-operated Lopez Canyon Landfill. The county has refused to enforce some 
aspects of a stringent state order limiting operations at Lopez Canyon, which 
is located in the northeast San Fernando Valley and receives two-thirds of the 
city's residential trash. 
</P>
<P>
All parties involved agreed that it would be an administrative nightmare for 
the state board to oversee local dumps and locations where refuse is stockpiled 
and transferred from truck to truck. The board has an office in Fullerton, but 
Gary King, chief of that division, said he would need more staff to handle 
updating permits and frequently inspecting the 83 locations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's something that's been fully thought out yet," Peck said. 
"But if we have to do it, we'll do it one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting Tuesday drew representatives of other California counties, who said 
they were concerned that they too might lose local control to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Several of them said state intervention actually could mean less careful 
scrutiny of trash disposal -- because the board's regional offices are widely 
spread -- and could end up being more costly to counties. Counties would end up 
paying for the state's enforcement services, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expert's Assessment 
</P>
<P>
"You need to be there to see that the problems are solved," said Richard 
Pantages, solid waste administrator for Alameda County. "You don't need to send 
letters and nasty notes and stuff -- that's what the state does." 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Coffee, who heads Los Angeles County's solid waste management 
program, said he was disappointed that he had failed in his efforts to convince 
the state board that his inspectors are doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee criticized as inaccurate a waste board staff report that listed 26 
transfer stations and nine dumps where violations are allegedly occurring. 
</P>
<P>
The state waste board report recited a litany of problems, ranging from dumps 
being permitted to take more trash than allowed under their state-issued 
permits to failure to complete permit reviews every five years. One of the 
state staff members who helped prepare the report, Lisa Dernbach, said that 
most of her evidence came directly from Coffee's inspectors' reports. 
</P>
<P>
But Coffee conceded that in numerous instances the county had not kept the 
waste board informed of its enforcement actions. He said he would work on 
improving that communication during the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's partly a staffing problem," Coffee said after the meeting. "And other 
things got in the way, like Lopez Canyon Landfill. It has taken up most of my 
time the last three to four months." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fumes Fell 2 
</P>
<P>
Although neighbors of Lopez Canyon have complained about noise, odors and 
litter at Lopez Canyon Landfill for years, the state turned its spotlight 
toward the dump in March, when two workers fainted after they unearthed some 
toxic fumes while digging into decaying trash. In June the state issued a 
strict order calling for the city to scale back operations there, but the city 
is fighting that order in court. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers of Thursday's meeting blamed politics for forcing the board to 
take a tougher-than-usual stance. 
</P>
<P>
A Little Hoover Commission report released earlier this summer chastised the 
board for being too cozy with the waste disposal industry and several pieces of 
pending legislation seek to create a new board with more public representation. 
Currently two board members have direct industry ties.

COMMINGLING OF TRADE UNIT FUNDS PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funds for a city-financed Africa trade group that figures in the investigation 
of Mayor Tom Bradley were commingled in the personal checking account of a 
mayoral aide, city officials revealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tony DeGuzman, chief auditor in the city controller's office, said records he 
has obtained and interviews with Juanita St. John, executive director of the 
Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, indicate that task force funds and 
personal funds were commingled in a checking account belonging to St. John's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate, but Deputy City Atty. Michael Guarino identified the 
daughter as Kathy St. John, a staff aide to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
According to Guarino, Juanita St. John said in an interview with DeGuzman 
earlier this year "that she had been using her daughter's checking account for 
task force purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Officials would not indicate how much money they believe passed through Kathy 
St. John's account, or how the funds were used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Family's Records 
</P>
<P>
Guarino said the city is attempting to force Juanita St. John to produce 
records from checking accounts of family members. The records are among those 
"critical to resolving the central question of what has happened to public 
funds placed in her trust," Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has been one focus of a wide-ranging probe of possible conflicts 
of interest between Bradley's public duties and personal business dealings. 
Juanita St. John, who has earned $40,000 annually as director of the task 
force, is a longtime friend and partner with Bradley in a Riverside County real 
estate deal. Chiefly on the strength of Bradley's personal support for the task 
force, the group has received some $400,000 in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has denied any conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
After news reports alleging task force board members benefited from the group's 
activities, the city controller and city attorney began investigating how tax 
money was used. The city, claiming it made repeated efforts to secure task 
force records, filed misdemeanor charges against Juanita St. John for failing 
to provide subpoenaed records showing how $180,000 in city funds were spent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arraignment Delayed 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Juanita St. John's lawyers won a postponement of her arraignment 
on the charges, pending the outcome of a series of challenges they have filed 
to the legality of City Controller Rick Tuttle's subpoena. Municipal Court 
Judge Stephen Marcus rescheduled the arraignment for Sept. 15. Among the 
disputes is whether the city can compel St. John to produce records from 
checking accounts of her immediate family members. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hirsch, Juanita St. John's attorney, has argued that is an invasion of 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch said he could not immediately respond to the commingling allegation, 
which surfaced in court document's filed by Guarino Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch said he had not discussed the matter with his client, but stressed it 
does not mean St. John misused public funds. "This could be a commingling of 
funds that (were) advancements and reimbursements. The question is whether 
everything washes out at the end and is all accounted for, not where it came 
from." 
</P>
<P>
However, Guarino cited a section of the city's funding contract with the Africa 
task force that required St. John to maintain a separate account and records 
for the use of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy St. John could not be reached for comment. Bradley's press spokesman, 
Bill Chandler, declined to comment on the allegation, saying it is "between the 
city attorney and Juanita's lawyers." After checking, Chandler said Bradley and 
top mayoral aides knew nothing about the alleged commingling of task force 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not in Court 
</P>
<P>
Juanita St. John did not appear in court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a telephone interview with The Times last week, she bitterly denied 
doing anything improper and disputed the city's charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force will owe me money when this is over," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never a question of not" providing records, she said, adding that 
preparations for her daughter's recent wedding delayed her response to city 
auditors' requests. "I'm getting the (remaining records) together." 
</P>
<P>
She claimed the amount of city funds not accounted for has been overstated. 
Tuttle "may not like the way I do my accounting," she said, but the funds 
unaccounted for "was never over $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
She said those funds were spent appropriately on "salaries, travel and just 
running the office."

HIGH COURT BACKS RENT BOARD AUTHORITY; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL CAN RESOLVE EXCESSIVE-RENT CASES, ORDER REPAYMENT; APPEALS ALLOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court, reaffirming the regulatory authority of 
administrative agencies, ruled Thursday that a local rent control board may 
resolve excess-rent claims against landlords and order wrongdoers to repay 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But the justices, by a vote of 6 to 1, held also that landlords must get the 
chance to challenge a repayment order in court -- and that a board may not go 
so far as to assess triple damages for a deliberate rent overcharge. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in a legal challenge by landlords to a Santa Monica rent 
control law enacted in 1979 as one of the most stringent in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The landlords argued that the rent control board, in deciding excessive-rent 
disputes, had unlawfully assumed judicial powers in violation of the state 
Constitution. The board lacked authority to resolve such cases, assess damages 
or authorize rent withholding by tenants, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The board replied that its assertion of such authority was a practical and 
lawful means of enforcing rent-control regulations -- and that a ruling to the 
contrary would undermine the well-established authority of countless 
administrative agencies to exercise quasi-judicial authority in the regulatory 
process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Complete Win' 
</P>
<P>
The high court's ruling Thursday upholding the general authority of the board 
to resolve rent disputes was greeted enthusiastically by Joel Martin Levy, 
counsel for the board. He noted that the treble-damages provision has since 
been removed from the law -- and said that the rent-withholding section was 
insignificant. "We look upon this as a complete win," Levy said. "From our 
point of view, we got everything we really wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Nitti, an attorney representing one of the landlords in the case, 
called the ruling "a split decision." 
</P>
<P>
"The court put limitations on treble damages, and more importantly, said the 
rent board decisions are not final," Nitti said. "On the other hand, the court 
gave the board credit for maturity and responsibility that the board does not 
possess. The board is biased in favor of tenants and is incapable of making a 
fair decision." 
</P>
<P>
In the decision, the justices agreed that while it was permissible for the 
board to levy fines, make awards of costs and attorneys' fees and take similar 
steps to ensure compliance with the law, the since-abandoned provision of the 
ordinance allowing treble damages against landlords was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Such power, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas wrote, "poses a risk of producing 
arbitrary, disproportionate results. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Nor, said the court, could the city allow a tenant to immediately withhold rent 
without permitting a landlord to seek judicial review of such an order. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resolving Disputes 
</P>
<P>
But the justices found that the board's general power to resolve disputes and 
order restitution by errant landlords was permissible -- so long as doing so 
was "reasonably necessary" to enforce rent control and losing parties remained 
free to challenge board orders in court. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Allen E. Broussard agreed that the board's general 
assertion of authority was legitimate, but he objected to the court's 
invalidation of the treble-damages and rent-withholding provisions. 
</P>
<P>
"If we follow the majority's lead in this case, we will put ourselves in the 
business of deciding whether the thousands of administrative regulations that 
bind up modern commercial activity are a good idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in a suit brought in 1982 by Haidy McHugh, a Santa Monica 
landlord involved in an excessive-rent dispute with two tenants. McHugh, later 
joined by 20 other landlords, challenged a board award of $4,390.99 in damages 
to the two tenants -- triple the amount of her alleged overcharge. At the time, 
the ordinance permitted damages of $500 or three times the overcharge, which 
ever was higher, for willful violations of rent control laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trial Court Ruling 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a trial court judge ruled that the board had improperly assumed 
judicial authority in violation of the Constitution and barred the board from 
receiving complaints, holding hearings and awarding damages in excessive-rent 
cases. Later, a state Court of Appeal found the board's actions lawful, and 
McHugh and the other landlords took the issue to the state Supreme Court.

HAHN ENDS TWO DAYS OF QUESTIONING BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn and a team of investigators completed 
their interrogation of Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday, capping the city's 
five-month-long investigation of possible conflicts of interest by the chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
With Hahn taking the unusual role of joining his deputies, the questioning took 
10 1/2 hours and spanned just a day and a half, well short of the three days 
that had been anticipated by the mayor's staff. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to the investigation described the sessions as "sometimes 
tense" but overall rated Bradley as a "cooperative" subject. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by his aides, Hahn bounded out of the mayor's City Hall offices just 
before noon Thursday and told waiting reporters, "We're finished for the day. 
We have no plans to return today." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Hahn and his deputies met with Bradley and his legal staff for about 3 
1/2 hours Thursday after a seven-hour session Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Date 
</P>
<P>
Hahn indicated that the questioning of Bradley was over for now, but he left 
open the possibility that his investigators could revisit the mayor at some 
future date. 
</P>
<P>
When asked when the entire investigation might be completed, Hahn said only, 
"I'm not done yet." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hahn indicated that his final report will be released in September. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, in the midst of the most politically delicate investigation of his 
five-year tenure as the city's chief prosecutor, batted away most reporters' 
questions with a curt "no comment," as he hastily walked out of the mayor's 
suite and down the corridor to elevators that whisked him to his own 
headquarters on the 18th floor of City Hall East. 
</P>
<P>
While Hahn took the unusual position of joining his investigators for the 
interview, sources said his presence may have been more ceremonial than of 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Balance of Power' 
</P>
<P>
"He was basically there to enforce the balance of power in the room and to 
enforce Bradley's pledge to cooperate," rather than act as the chief 
inquisitor, said one source close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear what specifically was asked of Bradley and how the mayor 
responded, but the city attorney has said that he is investigating several 
broad areas for possible conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Under investigation are the mayor's ties to two financial institutions that did 
business with the city: Far East National Bank, which employed him as an 
$18,000-a-year adviser, and Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., where as a 
director he was paid up to $24,000 a year for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney is also probing the relationship of Bradley and the Task 
Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, a city-sponsored civic group headed by 
Bradley business associate Juanita St. John. Also being probed are some of 
Bradley's overseas travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Figures 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, with four of his deputies and two Police Department detectives from the 
bunco-forgery detail, questioned Bradley in the mayor's City Hall office. The 
city attorney's staff has reportedly interviewed scores of people -- including 
some of Bradley's closest assistants, such as chief deputy Mike Gage -- and 
reviewed thousands of documents. Bradley is believed to be the last of the key 
figures to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the investigation said the interviews with Bradley 
indicate that the investigators are nearing the end of their "field work" and 
will shortly begin sorting information and writing their report.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY IN DEPUTY'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman pleaded guilty Thursday to voluntary manslaughter charges in the death 
of a sheriff's deputy who was gunned down as he tried to serve a search warrant 
at a cocaine rock house allegedly run by her. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy L. Waters, 42, of South-Central Los Angeles, had been charged with 
murder in the January, 1988, death of Deputy Jack Miller, 33, a 12-year veteran 
of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
But in a plea bargain with the district attorney's office, Waters was allowed 
to plead guilty in Superior Court to the lesser manslaughter count. 
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 22 to up to 11 years in state prison. 
Had she been convicted of the murder charge, she could have been sentenced to 
up to 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that although Waters' now-deceased son was the person who 
actually shot and killed Miller, Waters was charged with his murder because she 
set up the drug operation, including the purchase of firearms, that led to the 
fatal shoot-out with sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' son, Edward Walker, 20, shot and killed himself during that same gun 
battle.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRAWL ERUPTS OVER WIDENING OF STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fistfights and shoving matches erupted outside a homeowners' meeting in Encino 
on Thursday evening as residents who disagree over whether Reseda Boulevard 
should be extended clashed outside an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
The scuffles, involving about 10 people, occurred before a meeting organized by 
the Encino Property Owners Assn. and the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety 
Organization. The groups are asking that Reseda Boulevard be lengthened to 
Mulholland Drive to alleviate heavy traffic on Havenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a group called the Friends of Caballero Canyon confronted the Encino 
residents outside the Lanai Road Elementary School auditorium, and the shouting 
and shoving began. The Caballero Canyon group carried signs protesting the 
proposed Reseda Boulevard paving, saying it would bring additional development 
and threaten wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Marvin Braude was besieged by the crowd outside the school. 
Several shouted that they were being excluded from the meeting, attended by 
about 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
Police dispersed the protesters, who had been banging on the school doors. 
There were no arrests.

3 BOYS SAVED FROM FLAMES IN APARTMENT 
</P>

Two men fought their way through thick smoke to save three terrified boys from 
a burning apartment in Lancaster on Thursday morning after the boys' mother 
went outside and left a candle burning in her bedroom, Los Angeles County Fire 
Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Wesley White and Chris Willis, neighbors of the family, saved 
the lives of James, Josiah and Philip Halstead, ages 11, 7, and 6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$20,000 in Damage 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused at least $20,000 damage and was blamed on careless use of the 
candle, said Fire Department spokesman Don Kanallakan. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers Thursday were questioning the boys' mother, Donna Halstead, 34, 
to determine whether to take the boys into protective custody, said Emery 
Bontrager of the county Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the boys and a sister were left in the care of a grandmother of 
Halstead's boyfriend in Rosamond, Bontrager said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out around midnight in the apartment building in the 45400 block 
of Cedar Avenue. White, 18, and Willis, 22, who work together at a Lancaster 
tire shop, ran to the scene fearing for the safety of White's newborn, who 
lives with his mother in an apartment next to the Halsteads. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole neighborhood was standing out here, but nobody was doing anything," 
Willis said. "We had to go in." 
</P>
<P>
The two said they made their way through thick smoke to the boys' bedroom, 
which was next to the bedroom where the fire had started. "We couldn't see, but 
we could hear them crying and screaming," White said. "They were scared to come 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Willis pulled one boy out the front door to safety and White, who said he lost 
consciousness briefly from the smoke and was startled awake by falling against 
a hot object, rescued the other two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thanks Rescuers 
</P>
<P>
A distraught Halstead thanked the two men in front of her gutted apartment 
Thursday as a crowd of neighbors and reporters looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Halstead said she had checked on the boys and gone out to ask a neighbor for a 
cigarette. "I was just gone about three minutes," she said. "I forgot to blow 
out the candle." 
</P>
<P>
Halstead said she used candles for light because her electricity had been 
turned off for non-payment. She said she had left a candle burning on a trunk 
near her bed. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department Battalion Chief Jerry Peskett said investigators were 
attempting to determine where the fire began, and checking reports that the 
youngest boy had moved the candle from the trunk to his mother's bed. 
</P>
<P>
Bontrager said the Department of Children's Services has had previous contact 
with the family, but he would not elaborate.

FRUSTRATION, REDEMPTION PUNCTUATE GOLF MAJORS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a theme throughout this year's major golf championships that might be 
described as the Grand Slam of Choke. The lesson may have been that everybody 
does so at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
For the victors, such as PGA winner Payne Stewart, the majors were redeeming. 
For the losers, such as Mike Reid, there was self-doubt and continuing 
anonymity. Stewart finally became a player of stature when he captured the PGA 
on Sunday at Kemper Lakes, rising from six strokes back and deep in the field. 
Reid was the leader for three rounds, but was upstaged each day, first by 
Arnold Palmer, then by the weather, and then by his own failure and Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all identify with each other," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Reid shared the PGA lead after one round, led by two shots after two rounds, by 
three shots after three rounds, and still by three as he stood on the 16th tee 
Sunday. But Stewart, in a get-up of cap and plus fours, came from six strokes 
back to grab the title. He birdied four of the last five holes, while Reid 
bogeyed the 16th and double-bogeyed the 17th with a lock-wristed three-putt. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 32, has been known for his costumes, eccentricities and rich 
endorsements, but also for losing, with 11 second places. So he was something 
of a braggart in accepting the trophy, the guy who does the dance in the end 
zone, waggles the ball in your face. "Sales," he said, "are about to go up." 
</P>
<P>
Reid, 35, thin and soft-spoken with glasses too big for his face, did not even 
curse after his 2-over 74. "Dog breath," he said. He has just two career 
titles, and until 1987 was known as the first player to earn $1 million without 
winning a tournament. Now he will be known as the most sympathetic player on 
tour, one who played the 17th as many a recreational golfer has, stubbing his 
chip and jerking a two-foot putt that gave the title to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"Where does a guy go to cry around here?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was an excruciating defeat to watch, and even Jack Nicklaus was moved to 
seek out a weeping Reid in the locker room, and speak soft words. "I just want 
to say that I've never felt so bad for anyone in my life," Nicklaus told him. 
"You played too well not to win." 
</P>
<P>
During the first round, Reid was all but ignored in the pandemonium over the 
59-year-old Palmer's round of 68 that put him just two strokes back. Palmer, 
who won eight majors but never a PGA, was heard from again Sunday, his 70 
coming with a downhill, 25-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole that provoked the 
biggest noise of the tournament. He finished at 5-over 293 to salvage a third 
round of 81, and left the course with his arms high over his head as if he had 
won. "It meant a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second round it was Craig Stadler's course-record 64 that eclipsed Reid. 
In the third it was a magnificent thunderstorm that overwhelmed his play. He 
also was overshadowed by the course, as the 7,197-yard Kemper Lakes yielded 153 
subpar rounds, a record for any major championship. But Reid's demise was 
merely one of many in a year that may be best remembered for failures. Greg 
Norman's loss in a playoff to Mark Calcavecchia in the British Open after a 
final round 64, and two double bogeys this past week that kept him out of 
contention, might suggest some sort of hex. "Do I invite disaster? I certainly 
have a flair for attracting it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Grady of Australia, who also fell to Calcavecchia, now has finished 
second 27 times in his career. Tom Kite, another perennial runner-up in majors, 
vainly tried to rationalize how he lost a four-stroke lead to Curtis Strange in 
the final round of the U.S. Open at Oak Hill, committing a triple bogey and two 
double bogeys. "I played 13 holes in one under," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Hoch lost the Masters playoff with Nick Faldo of Britain when he could 
not make a two-foot par putt. Sunday he failed to earn a coveted berth on the 
Ryder Cup team when he bogeyed the last two holes. That, combined with Dave 
Rummells's freakish 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th, meant Mark McCumber was 
named instead. Hoch had to finish fifth to unseat McCumber, but tied for 
seventh with Stadler. 
</P>
<P>
"This reinforces that I can't do what I need to do to win," Hoch said. "If 
people weren't around I'd probably be breaking things." 
</P>
<P>
Reid, Hoch, Kite, Norman and Grady could only bear in mind that the 1989 Grand 
Slam victors had once been in the same position. 
</P>
<P>
Strange was called the most talented underachiever in the game until he broke 
through to win the U.S. Open at Brookline, Mass., last year. His victory at Oak 
Hill was a reaffirmation, as was his tie for second Sunday with a 69 that 
included a half-dozen missed birdie putts. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo was called "Foldo" by his home media until he won the '87 British Open, 
and authenticated his talent by coming from nowhere to win the Masters. 
Calcavecchia was on and off the PGA Tour three times, broke and struggling, 
before he emerged. His playoff victory over Norman and Grady for his first 
major was the culmination of an essay in determination. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sorry for Greg," Calcavecchia said the morning after his victory. "But 
I slept on it and I don't feel sorry for him anymore. I beat him fair and 
square." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart finished second in the 1985 British Open to Sandy Lyle. Four times in 
the last six years he was among the top 10 at the British. During his final PGA 
round of 67, he talked to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked, How about some good stuff for Payne Stewart one time?" 
</P>
<P>
So when he kicked down the invisible wall for his first major, he did not 
hesitate to congratulate himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played so well and come so close, and come away empty so often, that 
there's a little justice here," he said. "And I'm going to savor it."

PLAYING SCARED; 
</P>
<P>
BROWN ALWAYS ON LOOKOUT FOR RAMS' X-MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nervously twisting the gold band around his finger, Richard Brown recalls the 
knot that tightened in his stomach the day the X-man walked by his window. 
</P>
<P>
It was about this time last year. Brown, a free agent from San Diego State, had 
earned a place on the Rams as a linebacker-special teams player in 1987, but 
the 1988 camp had been a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to camp at 265 pounds, 25 above his playing weight. He had been so 
eager to improve during the off-season and to disprove the neighborhood folks 
who saw his glass as half empty that he ran himself twice as hard. All that 
produced was a stress fracture in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had forbidden him to run until the day before the 1988 camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
"I was strong enough when the camp opened, but I didn't have any stamina," he 
said. "By the end of practice, I was fading." 
</P>
<P>
When the X-man passed by his window a second time, he felt himself falling. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his poor camp, he had survived every cut so far. Now came the last cut. 
Brown was sitting in the Anaheim apartment near Rams Park that he and his wife 
Heather had rented. 
</P>
<P>
Ray San Jose, the Rams' X-man -- he's the guy who tells you that you've been 
Xed off the roster -- walked past Brown's window several times. Able to stand 
it no longer, Brown finally called San Jose over. 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'What's going on? Is my name on the list?' " Brown said. "He showed me 
the list. All the other names were typed. My name was written out in blue ink." 
</P>
<P>
Of all the things that could have stuck with him about that moment, the blue 
ink remains the most indelible. 
</P>
<P>
"Bluuuue ink," he repeated, then sighed. "Man, last year was really tough. I've 
got to make this team this year. I've got to." 
</P>
<P>
And so Richard Brown looks for the X-man everywhere -- in a coach's sideways 
look, in the whispers around the training table. Never mind that he is at his 
playing weight and is having a great training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur and Coach John Robinson 
have showered praise on him and indications all point to his making the team. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that injuries to other inside linebackers such as Fred Strickland, 
Mark Jerue and Larry Kelm have given him the opportunity to play. Or that after 
two exhibition games he is leading the team in tackles with nine. 
</P>
<P>
The X-man is out there, and the X-man cometh at the most inopportune times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get myself comfortable," he said. "I want to keep an edge, and 
I always can by just looking back on what happened to me last year." 
</P>
<P>
After he was cut by the Rams, Brown had tryouts with the New York Jets, San 
Diego Chargers and some Canadian Football League teams. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ram camp had taken a lot out of me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he went to work in his father-in-law's scale business, working in a service 
department. Then he and his brother got into landscaping. But his heart was 
never in it. 
</P>
<P>
He knew that people were talking behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 23, played his high school football at Westminster High School. He was a 
tight end and a linebacker but preferred defense because offense meant "you had 
to play under control." 
</P>
<P>
When he got a scholarship from San Diego State, he remembers hearing the 
neighborhood people saying he would flunk out of school. 
</P>
<P>
When, as a free agent, he tried out with the Rams, he heard the neighborhood 
say that he was silly to even try and that he should settle into something 
steady. 
</P>
<P>
When he made the team, he heard, "Well, you only sit on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a tough audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to deal with the mental games, the talk," Brown said. "I'm the 
type who likes to get down to basics. Let's play the game, slap heads, have 
some fun. I like to hit, but the talk gets to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why things are that way; I wish I had the answer. There just 
happens to be a lot of people who are more than willing to put someone down who 
is trying to accomplish a goal. It eats me inside out. But it's something I 
just had to swallow up last year. My real friends got me through last year, my 
real friends and my wife." 
</P>
<P>
When people compliment him on the training camp he is having, Brown is fond of 
saying his training camp began the day he was cut in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
When people tell him to take it easy, that his performance so far has virtually 
assured him a spot on the roster he tells them, "I don't even think positive." 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked to interview him, he sheepishly agreed but only under the 
condition that the interview be done in his apartment, as much as saying that 
only stars deserve to be interviewed out in the open. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on the small, single bed that makes sleep difficult for a man 6-feet-3 
and 240 pounds, with already a lot on his mind, Brown talks in the bedroom of 
his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
They put him on the third floor, along with the rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Across the quad of the Ram compound, in an apartment converted into a media 
center, Bill Hawkins, the No. 1 draft pick who signed Thursday for $1.9 
million, is being interviewed en masse. 
</P>
<P>
Attention, big money, little doubt about his future, Hawkins has just about 
everything Brown doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, he deserves it, he should enjoy it. Some guys are blessed," Brown said. 
"We're two different players. I'm sure he doesn't know what it's like to be in 
my position or see things from my perspective." 
</P>
<P>
From Brown's perspective, the X-man is still out there. At a Monday practice, 
Brown hurt his shoulder and wasn't able to go full speed for a couple of days. 
X-man notices those kind of things. So sore shoulder or not, he was going 
full-bore Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of wanting to play with pain, I've got to," he said. "You 
don't know if you're going to aggravate it or not. But I got to play, I got to 
make it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said his offense was hurting, and meant it quite literally. 
There are no uninjured tight ends to practice with, and fullback Robert Delpino 
and tailback Gaston Green were listed as uncertain for Monday night's 
exhibition game against Phoenix at Anaheim Stadium. "Right now, Richard Calvin 
(a free agent from Washington State) is our starting tailback," Robinson said. 
"Hopefully that situation changes." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the only tight end with even a chance of playing Monday is Vernon 
Kirk. Asked if the team may pick up a free-agent tight end for the one game, he 
said, "No. It might be embarrassing Monday, but we can live with the 
embarrassment rather than get off track. We're going to resist giving in to the 
present state of affairs."

JIM MURRAY: MARK HIS WORDS, 60 HOME RUNS STILL POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the long history of major league baseball, only 10 men have hit 50 or more 
homers in a season. Only two have hit 60 or more. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 28 years since anyone hit 50 in the American League. That would be 
Roger Maris, who hit 61 in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
When he did that, the then-commissioner of baseball, quaking in his concern for 
the memory of Babe Ruth, put an asterisk next to the achievement in the record 
book, noting that it was done in a season eight games longer than the ones Ruth 
played in. The commissioner was afraid, apparently, that the 60-homer season 
would become commonplace with expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Frick needn't have worried. Not only has no one hit 60 in that league 
since, no one has even hit 50. 
</P>
<P>
Will anyone ever hit 60 again? Will anyone even hit 50? 
</P>
<P>
I took the problem to one of the young men I consider to be a prime threat to, 
one day, get an asterisk after his name -- Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire is a hitter for the Oakland Athletics, who looks as if he had just 
walked off a Saturday Evening Post cover -- sandy hair, blue eyes, just a hint 
of freckles. He's as strong as truck-stop coffee and as uncomplicated as a 
summer day, the All-American type who seemingly can deal with the everyday 
pressures of big league baseball as nonchalantly as the Babe himself. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire hit more home runs, 49, in his first year than any other rookie who 
ever played and might have hit 50 if he hadn't shortened the season to go home 
for the birth of his first child. 
</P>
<P>
Very few people have hit 100 home runs as quickly in their big league careers 
as McGwire. His teammate, Jose Canseco, is one. Tony Conigliaro of the Boston 
Red Sox was another. 
</P>
<P>
So I thought Mark might be a good man to ask what it might take to hit 60 home 
runs now. Kevin Mitchell of the San Francisco Giants is 18 homers ahead of him 
this year -- but Mark is 14 ahead of Mitchell lifetime. And four years younger. 
</P>
<P>
Are 60 homers in a season even possible? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
"I know guys who can do it," he said. "Freddy McGriff of Toronto, Jose 
(Canseco), Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
What about Mark McGwire? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire sighed. "Well, it would depend on a number of factors." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let's see. It'd go about like this: 
</P>
<P>
"1. The media. You have to take into account what the media would do today as 
you got closer. I don't think those old-time ballplayers like Ruth and Maris 
had that to contend with. (Oh, yes, Maris did!) 
</P>
<P>
"Today, you would have Channels 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and '60 Minutes' and every 
magazine and newspaper in the country on your doorstep, in your locker, in the 
shower. To hit 60 home runs, you'd need to concentrate solely on your game and 
these distractions wouldn't help. 
</P>
<P>
"2. Jose Canseco. You need the other dangerous hitter in the lineup behind you 
or ahead of you. Ruth had (Lou) Gehrig. Henry Aaron had Eddie Mathews. Maris 
had Mickey Mantle. (Willie) Mays had (Willie) McCovey. Frank Robinson had 
Brooks Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I would need Jose Canseco. Or vice versa. You need that other hitter so the 
pitchers can't pitch around you, so that you get pitches to hit. You can't get 
60 home runs swinging at ball four all season." 
</P>
<P>
"3. Adjustment. You're not going to get the same pitches all year long. What 
you hit home runs off the first half of the season, you're not going to get the 
last half. Pitchers will make you hit something else. They're not going to 
throw you what you've shown you can hit. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to adjust to a new location or a new speed. That's why a lot of guys 
have a flock of home runs by the All-Star break but tail off after that. You 
don't get 60 homers in a half a season." 
</P>
<P>
"4. Health. You have to stay healthy and injury-free. You have to be able to 
fight off fatigue. September might be the most important month. (Ruth hit 17 
home runs in September of the season he hit 60.) And if you're mentally 
fatigued, your timing is all off. 
</P>
<P>
"5. Pull. I don't mean influence, I mean pulling the ball. I get most of my 
home runs to left-center or center. To hit 60, you have to pull the ball a lot, 
get your share of foul-line home runs. I don't think it's possible to hit 60 
420-foot home runs. Too many things have to go just right. 
</P>
<P>
"6. Patience. I never, or almost never, hit a home run while I'm trying to. I 
didn't even know I was a home run hitter when I was coming up. I just tried to 
hit the ball fair some place. That's when you get home runs. I led the nation 
(with 32 home runs) when I was in college (at USC). Then I hit 24 home runs at 
Modesto. But a home run happens. You don't forceit." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a generation now since anyone even hit 50 in the American League. Lou 
Gehrig never hit 50. Neither did the all-time homer champion, Henry Aaron. 
Neither did Roger Maris, except for his record year. 
</P>
<P>
The only batters who hit 60 were left-handed, but all but three of the nine who 
hit 50 were strictly right-handed -- Ralph Kiner, Mays, Hack Wilson, Hank 
Greenberg, Jimmie Foxx, George Foster. Mantle was a switch-hitter, Johnny Mize 
and Ruth were lefties. 
</P>
<P>
Are even 50 possible? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire laughed. "Well, I would need some great September!" He has 21 to date. 
</P>
<P>
Does he aim for 600 lifetime? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire shook his head. "What my goal is has nothing to do with that. I want to 
win a WorldSeries." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there's one way to look at that: Every guy who has ever hit 60 home runs 
has led his team to a World Series victory. Look it up.

A SHORT STINT; 
</P>
<P>
ANDERSON HAS BEEN A RELIEF FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If a man can be judged by the tonic he drinks, the Angels' Kent Anderson is an 
easy one to figure. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Anderson's elixir of choice sits on the top shelf of his Anaheim 
Stadium locker, a small bottle from which he swigs before every game he plays. 
</P>
<P>
It's called Pepto-Bismol. 
</P>
<P>
"Just something to coat the stomach a little bit," Anderson explains. "Any time 
you're nervous, your stomach goes to work. I've had a little bit of a nervous 
stomach lately." 
</P>
<P>
Hard to imagine why. 
</P>
<P>
For the last week, Anderson, a 25-year rookie who began this season at triple-A 
Edmonton, has been the Angels' emergency starting shortstop. He will play that 
position for at least two more weeks, probably through the early days of 
September, or as long as it takes for the broken bone in Dick Schofield's left 
hand to mend. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the team Anderson plays for is locked in its first title race 
since 1986. The Angels will start tonight's game against the Cleveland Indians 
trailing the Oakland Athletics by one game in the American League West, so 
Anderson cannot be afforded any grace period. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that his margin for error is almost nil. 
</P>
<P>
He also knows that the man he's trying to replace seldom made an error, leading 
AL shortstops in fielding percentage in both 1987 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
So, Anderson keeps his eye on the ball, his feet on the ground and his bottle 
of Pepto-Bismol within easy reach. 
</P>
<P>
"You know there's pressure," Anderson says. "You notice it, you realize it. All 
you can do is try not to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"You relax the best you can. You realize that these games are more important 
than other ones, but you try to tell yourself that they aren't." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Consider last weekend's Angels-A's 
series at Anaheim Stadium, which attracted more than 175,000 fans and inspired 
such media designations as must-win, do-or-die and apocalyptic. 
</P>
<P>
For two games, Anderson looked much the part of the uncertain rookie -- 
striking out twice against Mike Moore Friday night and playing the infield as 
if it were land-mined Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth inning of Sunday's finale, Anderson broke a 1-1 tie with a 
two-run triple off Dave Stewart, Oakland's Cy Young Award candidate. It was the 
key blow in a 4-3 Angel victory. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's hit irked Stewart to the point of disdain. "You make the pitch you 
want and he hits a soft triple," Stewart sneered. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Stewart's reaction was forwarded to Anderson. No matter. Anderson 
couldn't stop smiling. He wasn't about to trade the hit in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It must've been a good pitch because I hit it where I wanted it," he says. 
"(The A's) had a couple of hits just like it the day before, so I don't feel 
sorry about it." 
</P>
<P>
For Anderson, who's batting .216 in 51 games with 11 runs batted in, the triple 
was a highlight. 
</P>
<P>
"That pretty much tops the list," he said. "Coming against Stewart, with us 
really needing that game. That was a big thrill." 
</P>
<P>
But some people, they're never happy. Sunday's hero, Anderson was a topic of 
debate Monday night on the Angels' postgame radio talk show. One fan phoned in, 
promoting the idea of sending Anderson back to Edmonton and signing Rey 
Quinones, the ex-Boston, ex-Seattle, ex-Pittsburgh shortstop as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy thought Quinones was going to hit a little more," said Angel relief 
pitcher Bryan Harvey, who happened to be tuned in. "I think the guy's crazy. 
Idiots. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Andy's a rookie, on defense, it don't show. He makes all the 
plays. And I think his hitting's going to come around once he sees all the 
pitchers a little more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what these people can be thinking. I don't know how they can come 
up with that deal." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader, the Angels' manager, was more emphatic about it. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get Quinones, we lose," Rader said flatly. "There'd be two things wrong 
with doing that. For one, what's wrong with Andy? And, two, how is Quinones 
going to help us? He can't play." 
</P>
<P>
Rader says he's been a fan of Anderson ever since he had to send him down to 
Edmonton before opening day. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the conversation he had when I told him he was going back to 
Edmonton," Rader said. "He told me, 'It's a mistake. I should be playing in the 
big leagues.' 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'Well, unfortunately, you're not going to be now. Hopefully, there 
will come a time when you will.' 
</P>
<P>
"A couple weeks later, Schoey goes down and we call Andy back up. We're on our 
first road trip and as soon as I see him, I tell him, 'You're right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was recalled on April 13, when Schofield was sidelined with a torn 
chest muscle. Anderson was strictly to serve as temporary help, to split time 
at shortstop with utility man Glenn Hoffman until Schofield was ready to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
But then, Anderson hit safely in the first five games he played. After a week, 
he was entrenched as the starting shortstop. After two weeks, he was still 
batting .300. 
</P>
<P>
And after three weeks, when Schofield was re-activated from the disabled list, 
Anderson, to his surprise, was still an Angel. To make room for Schofield, the 
Angels sent outfielder Brian Brady to Edmonton instead. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson had won a spot on the team, a spot he has held ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"He played very well this spring and when he took over for Schofield, he played 
well again," Rader said. "That convinced me that we needed another infielder. 
The bottom line is, yes, he should be here." 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson: "I wasn't counting down the days till he was healthy, but I 
figured I'd be here as long as Schofield needed to recuperate fully. Once that 
happened, I knew they'd have to make a move and it would probably be me. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm still up here. Good for me." 
</P>
<P>
That he's still starting, during the heated days of late August, might 
initially seem peculiar, considering the availability of Hoffman, a nine-year 
veteran, on Rader's bench. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Rader's contention that a less experienced shortstop with greater 
range is more valuable to a team in contention. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy's a truer shortstop," Rader said. "He has a little better range and a 
better arm. That's what you need in an everyday shortstop, which Hoff no longer 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is aware of his limitations. He has never batted as high as .280 at 
any level of professional baseball and he knows his future is to be doing what 
he's doing now -- backing up in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd talked with coaches in the organization and they told me my way to the big 
leagues might be as a utility player," Anderson said. "That's probably going to 
be my role. I'm not flashy. But I get the job done most of the time. I'd call 
myself steady and pretty consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I can stay consistent these next few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
And if his stomach can't do the same, relief, in his locker stall, is there for 
the taking.

Brian Lonon, five-time Army boxing champion, has been arrested in Killeen, 
Tex., and accused of cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrested Lonon at his home after finding cocaine valued at 
about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. boxing team said they were uncertain whether Lonon's 
arrest will keep him from competing for the U.S. team in the World 
Championships at Moscow next month.

FORBES FETE: BIRTHDAY FIT FOR A SULTAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The invitations, printed on Forbes stationery, began: "Our father is not in 
heaven yet, and as he also still signs our paychecks we are anxious to make his 
seventieth birthday a memorable one . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the five children of Malcolm Stevenson Forbes have made sure that when 
their father, the chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, turns the 
big seven-O on Saturday he won't feel too ancient. 
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, limousines began pulling up to Hangar 14 at the John F. 
Kennedy International Airport in New York, where some 600 friends and business 
associates, including California Gov. George Deukmejian and his wife Gloria, 
boarded three chartered planes. Destination: Tangier, Morocco, for a 
48-hour-long birthday celebration fit for a sultan. The weekend will be capped 
with a black-tie bash at Forbes' private Tangier palace, Palais Mendoub, on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Titans of big business and even the most jaded social types are ga-ga. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inconceivable," said Barry Kaye, president of Barry Kaye Associates, a 
life insurance agency in Century City, who is a guest along with his wife, 
Carole. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Malcolm's style," allowed advice columnist Abigail Van Buren, who is 
attending with her husband Mort Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the guest list alone reads something like, well, the Forbes 400. 
Included are the chairmen and chief executive officers of dozens of major 
corporations, including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chrysler Corporation, 
Compaq Computer Corp. and Computerland Corp. -- and those are just some of the 
Cs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous Faces 
</P>
<P>
There are famous faces, including Elizabeth Taylor (Forbes' date), Henry 
Kissinger, Walter Cronkite, William F. Buckley, Barbara Walters and her husband 
Merv Adelson. There are headline makers, such as Wall Street star Henry Kravis 
and his wife, designer Carolyne Roehm. There are media tycoons, such as John 
Kluge, Rupert Murdoch, Katherine Graham and Mort Zuckerman. There are fashion 
designers Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Arnold Scaasi. There are the 
governors of New Jersey and Rhode Island. Even Robin Leach, the host of 
television's "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," made the list. 
</P>
<P>
The small Southern California contingent includes Betsy Bloomingdale, Leonard 
and Caroline Firestone, and Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive officer 
of Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Another 200 or so Moroccan guests will join the party, including King Hassan 
II, who is hosting a luncheon for the entire group Sunday before their 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list illustrates how Forbes has refined the art of mixing business 
with pleasure. Barry Kaye says that once he began advertising in the magazine 
last October, "all of a sudden we were invited for a couple lunches and a ride 
on the yacht. This is the way he develops his business. He's written about it. 
He just develops a wonderful relationship with you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian on List 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Gov. Deukmejian made the list not for his advertising budget but 
because he appeared on the magazine's cover February 27, 1984, and subsequently 
met twice with the Forbes editorial staff. 
</P>
<P>
Has he ever previously attended a Forbes party? "Not to my knowledge," says a 
spokesman in Sacramento. "This would be the first one." 
</P>
<P>
For early calendar entry, invitations were first mailed out in March and signed 
by Forbes' children Malcolm Jr. (Steve), Robert (Bob), Christopher (Kip), 
Timothy (Tim) and Moira Forbes Mumma. Since then "Ali-Dada" (as his children 
call Forbes in the invitation) updates began arriving, including the latest, 
sent by Federal Express to the California contingent at least, which arrived 
Monday and included a map to Hangar 14 at JFK and an airport pass. 
</P>
<P>
A few feathers flew when it was learned that three planes would be flying: a 
DC8, a 747 and Concorde. Those not earmarked for the faster-flying Concorde 
feared that a caste system was in operation. But Don Garson, director of 
corporate communications at Forbes, says that the decision was purely 
democratic. "Anybody who came a distance to get to New York will be on the 
Concorde," he said. Van Buren (and presumably the rest of the West Coast 
contingent) is assigned to Concorde. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tangier Itinerary 
</P>
<P>
The itinerary in Tangier begins with dinner upon arrival tonight at the Solazur 
Hotel, and the opportunity to shop or sightsee Saturday. The birthday bash 
unfolds Saturday night at Forbes' dazzling Palais Mendoub with dinner, dancing 
and fireworks. Dress code: Black tie, ball gowns, turbans and tiaras are all in 
order. "Scheherazade," as the invitation pointed out, "took 1,001 nights to 
keep her old man happy -- we're counting on one night in a thousand in a 
Moroccan palace to keep The Chairman smiling." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes purchased Palais Mendoub to serve as headquarters for the magazine in 
1970, around the time of the international oil crisis, so that he could publish 
an Arabic Forbes, beginning in 1972. The Arabic edition disbanded five or six 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
In his new book, "More Than I Dreamed," to be published in October by Simon 
&amp; Schuster, Forbes describes his first reaction to seeing the palace 
perched on a cliff. "The physical setting was breathtaking. To your right you 
can see Gibraltar. Straight ahead is Algeciras, the southernmost tip of Europe, 
only 20 minutes away. And to your left, the site of the battle of Trafalgar, 
and at the same time you can see every ship that enters or leaves the 
Mediterranean." No one will say how much the party is costing, or who is 
footing the bill, or for that matter, whether the whole thing will be written 
off on Forbes' taxes. A previously published estimate of a $2-million cost for 
the party was neither confirmed nor denied by Forbes' press office. "We don't 
know where that number comes from," said a spokesperson. "We never release 
numbers."

THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP BOP ON TOP OF TEENZINE SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, all you Bopperoos in Bop-land: Like, can you believe it! Summer's almost 
over! But don't lose your cool, 'cuz Bop writer Carmen Carmalatta wants you to 
get comfy with all your faves! Alyssa! Corey! Deb! And those five incredible, 
total babes New Kids On The Block! Donnie! Danny! Joe! Jon! Jordan! Fluff up 
your pillows, stargazers, and let's schmoooooze!!!! 
</P>
<P>
 Like, let's do the teenzine thing, people! And we're not talking about a new 
dance craze. We're talking 'bout a generation of rad-reading teens hooked on 
the poster-filled pages of Teen Town Celebs splashed in Bop and The Big Bopper 
-- top teen-fan mags brought to you by the princess of Bopland, Los Angeles' 
own Julie Laufer! 
</P>
<P>
Though this July 2, 1962, birthday girl and editor of the West Coast's top 
teenzines left her bubble gum on the bedpost eight years ago, she's still a 
teeny-bopper at heart! So are this Valley Girl's staff of college-grad news 
hounds, who go after Tinseltown tidbits for their 400,000 readers! 
</P>
<P>
Where do they get all that energy?! 
</P>
<P>
Hey, the teen stars they write about, and the teen readers who pore over the 
pages put out by Laufer's 22- to 32-year-old staff, take this business 
seriously! 
</P>
<P>
There's warmth in their words, sensitivity in their stories, and, for sure, 
lots of hype and hipness in the BIG, BOLD headlines that tease fans to discover 
why "Johnny Depp Is So Hurt!" or read about "The Day Corey Haim Will Never 
Forget!" or why Kirk Cameron says, "I Can't Take It Too Seriously!" 
</P>
<P>
Just how does Laufer's crew try to out-scoop the dozen or so other teenzines 
out there? 
</P>
<P>
Read on Boppers! 
</P>
<P>
But, first, let's cool the exclamation points and go to our panel of teen 
experts -- a couple of multitalented fabulous fellas we had a chance to talk 
with while curled up at our desks with a few of our fave Bop and TBB (teen talk 
for The Big Bopper) periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million-plus-a-year teenzine industry is a growing one, says Peter 
Zollo, president of Teenage Research Unlimited, a Northbrook, Ill.-based youth 
marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
He says that 12- to 19-year-olds -- kids his agency calls "Skippies," or school 
kids with income and purchasing power -- spend about $30 billion of their own 
money annually on items from tennis shoes to teenzines, which fall into two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-fan periodicals like Bop and TBB rely almost exclusively on newsstand and 
magazine-generated product sales, have no advertising and strictly adhere to 
lively written teen celeb stories about who's doing what with whom and where. 
But the stories never get steamier than what celebs are exchanging phone 
numbers. And photos are never hotter than a hand-holding twosome at a teen 
party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Outlets 
</P>
<P>
The other teenzine category includes such notables as Seventeen and the Los 
Angeles-based Teen, which are subscription- and advertiser-driven and focus 
articles on self-improvement and intellectual growth, Zollo says. 
</P>
<P>
Wow, is this guy brainy or what! 
</P>
<P>
Magazine expert Samir Husni, author of the "1988 Guide to Magazines," says "the 
whole magazine climate is on the rise, especially teen-fan magazines because of 
kids who are part of the MTV and Nickelodian generation." 
</P>
<P>
This professor-author-lecturer says the magazines are big sellers mostly with 
the 20 million 10- to 15-year-old girls known as the "tween" group or 
in-between teens. 
</P>
<P>
"The teenzines are still cheaper than buying a poster or a book about a teen 
star," Husni says. "Readers can get the whole catch from Kirk to whoever is hot 
on the Top 40 in one issue." 
</P>
<P>
That's what Laufer has offered readers month after month for six years, never 
tiring of dashing to teen celebrity birthday bashes sans drugs and booze, movie 
sets sans violence, sound stages sans heavy metal or video tapings sans sex and 
lies. She exults in escorting Bop contest winners backstage at concerts, which 
produce copy cleaner than a Clearasil-cleansed complexion. 
</P>
<P>
Any good teenzine editor knows that Rule No. 1 is to always be positive. 
</P>
<P>
And this 27-year-old editor, born under the sign of Cancer, is one groovy 
chick. So are her five staff writers -- all women who, like the teens they 
write for, occasionally do go ga-ga over the guys they interview. 
</P>
<P>
But don't call these young-at-heart women cradle-robbers! 
</P>
<P>
They're more like older sisters, says Laufer, whose photos with many of the 
teen stars accompany gossip columns. One of Laufer's faves is her very own 
Secrets from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, there's Laufer pictured with blond teen star Jonathan Ward of the 
television show "Charles in Charge." He "made me giggle when I met up with him 
at a Hollywood party," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
Flip through the pages and you'll find Laufer and other staffers immortalized 
on fast-speed film with the singing group New Kids On The Block, more teenfully 
known as the NKOTBs; Laufer with singer Deborah/Deb/Debbie Gibson; Laufer with 
"Growing Pains" star Cameron; Laufer with "Who's The Boss?" co-star Alyssa 
Milano, and Laufer with "My Two Dads' " teen sensation Staci Keanan. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a role model! 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't something that I had planned to go into," Laufer says, then adds 
she's glad she did. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the tens of thousands of letters received monthly, she says her 
teenzines are making a difference in the lives of girls -- they're 90%-95% of 
her readers -- who plunk down allowances for her publications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Take Readers Seriously' 
</P>
<P>
"We take our readers very seriously," she says. "A lot of the girls come from 
broken homes or are not in the happiest of homes." 
</P>
<P>
She says the average reader is middle class, has few friends, is not the most 
popular girl in school and probably doesn't have a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"They read us to escape," she says. And in the process, to learn just a little 
about teen life through the stories that reveal how teen stars also struggle to 
find acceptance among peers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
Laufer also takes pride in knowing that Bop and TBB promote literacy. "If we 
can get kids to read us, then we must be doing something right," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Charles Laufer, creator and former editor of Teen and former 
publisher of Tiger Beat, was the undisputed West Coast teenzine king when he 
started the magazines almost 40 years ago to interest kids in reading. ("I 
wasn't even born yet when my dad started Tiger Beat," she says.) Her dad sold 
the businesses and retired about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Julie and brother Scott, 28, president of Laufer Publishing, have 
put the family name back atop the teen heap. Two married sisters, Teena (named 
after Teen magazine) Naumann and Kerry Getson, Bop's first editor, serve on the 
board of directors of the company, which is privately held and will not 
disclose its annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Investments 
</P>
<P>
Her siblings pulled together resources from private investments and started Bop 
in the summer of 1983 with Michael J. Fox dominating almost every cover. These 
days -- because of his married man-father status -- a magnifying glass is 
needed to find Fox's photo among Bopdom's newer bachelor boys who outnumber 
(almost 3 to 1) the teen girls splashed on pages. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, The Big Bopper was born to meet the demand among readers for 
more teen celebrity stories that all couldn't squeeze into Bop. Today it is 
fast approaching the 200,000 circulation mark. The combined circulations of 
both teenzines are giving the East Coast competition a run for its money and 
bubble-gum-chewing readers. 
</P>
<P>
How do editor Julie and her crew meet the challenges of the publishing world? 
Like the stars they write about -- with energy, enthusiasm and Rule No. 2: "We 
have to make every story better than the last," she says. 
</P>
<P>
That mean's producing flashy issues crammed with pix (teenzine lingo for 
photos) and fax (teenzine lingo for facts) from shoe size to birth date to the 
dating woes of a teen babe, or as Laufer puts it: "Personal things readers can 
relate to." 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget the pages and pages of pinups and posters of pubescent teen 
hunks whose torsos are fully clothed, of course. One does not pick up Laufer 
publications for gawking at pint-sized stars in teeny-weeny swimming trunks. 
</P>
<P>
No way! says the editor. 
</P>
<P>
Freckles may meet fantasy in Laufer's teenzines but that's where the Bop stops. 
Besides, Laufer adds, that's where Rule No. 3 comes in: Go crazy with 
exclamation points! They use as many as 53 of them on a single page!! "They're 
cheerful!" Laufer says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kissing-Star Poems 
</P>
<P>
This is about as risque as Bop and its sister publication get, though fans, for 
possible publication, do send poems about kissing male teen stars on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't tackle heavy subjects and we don't want to be preachy, sexy or 
negative about anyone," Laufer says. "If we can cover a story and influence a 
reader in a positive way, that's great! We've reached our goal!" 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are times when a teen's star does get tarnished, she acknowledges. 
Take for instance the substance abuse troubles of notable Hollywood youth. 
</P>
<P>
Who, Julie, who?! Prodded for names, she finally relents: Haim and Drew 
Barrymore, who both went public with their problem, got help and now are 
members of the Just Say No gang. 
</P>
<P>
Teen stars -- those who have reformed and are back on top -- meet with writers 
to spill the details of what went awry. They make amends with readers, 
sometimes in two-part series with lots of quotes from Mom and lots of pix. 
</P>
<P>
Managing editor Sally Dobruskin, 26, says readers are mostly drawn to the teen 
posters "of the fellas." 
</P>
<P>
She fires away teen star's names with the aplomb of a well-read 14-year-old and 
adds that the NKOTB guys "have been our centerfold for the past four months. 
They are big!!! They're gonna get bigger!!! They're the hottest!!!" 
</P>
<P>
We're sold, Sal! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ask Alyssa' 
</P>
<P>
Dobruskin also works with teen star Milano, who writes a monthly "Ask Alyssa" 
advice column that receives more than 200 letters a week. Fans in-the-know 
address mail simply to "Lyss," whose photo in next month's TBB appears 21 times 
to Gibson's 10. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Milano, 16, has been a dynamo Dear Abby-Heloise-Dr. Ruth 
teenologist, answering not more than seven questions a month about health, 
beauty, peer pressure and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
One of our fave queries from an admiring adolescent fan: "How are ya doin' 
Alyssa? I'm only 12 years old, but I've had white hairs growing out of my head 
since the fourth-grade. Some of my friends say it's because I worry too much or 
that I'm in love. Do you know the answer?" 
</P>
<P>
 You bet she does! 
</P>
<P>
But you'll have to buy November's TBB to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a real sense of responsibility to the readers and my fans," says 
Milano, discussing her column after a photo shoot at Laufer Publishing's swank 
eighth-floor office suite in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"My fans also want to know how I deal with the paparazzi and how it feels to 
ride in stretch limos because they see those pictures of me in the magazines," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she wants to be a totally positive force for fans: "If they look up to 
me as a role model, then I want to be the best one around. I want to help." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Jay Ferguson, 15, who will portray Pony Boy in the fall Fox TV series 
"The Outsiders," hopes to fill his high-tops with high marks among readers. Bop 
publishers have singled out the Dallas-born Ferguson as a face most likely to 
cause a major meltdown with fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really prepared for anything, all this is new to me," he says after 
being interviewed for Bop and TBB by Laurel Dewey, the magazines' 28-year-old 
assistant editor. "Other teen stars tell me not to fool around and to stay 
concentrated," Ferguson says. And, to try to get as much exposure as possible, 
which suits teenzine editors just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teen stars are difficult to get interviews with," says Dewey. "They're 
either too shy or feel they've outgrown us." But that doesn't stop either 
teenzine from getting the story, photos or juicy tidbits readers want. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey's "Hot From Hollywood" column, which reads more like Rona Barrett with 
barrettes, is a fave with fans. Next month's offering reveals that 18-year-old 
singer Gibson has decided to sub pizza and cola with "a more nutritious diet!" 
NKOTB's Donnie Wahlberg spills the beans on a promise "to telephone Bop every 
three to four weeks to share all the exciting New Kids adventures!" 
</P>
<P>
But don't accuse Dewey or her co-workers of catering to stars barely out of 
braces. They take their cues from reader mail. Says Dewey: "We print stories 
for the readers, not for the artists, not for the management companies and not 
for publicists." 
</P>
<P>
For readers, it really doesn't matter. Even rewrites of resumes will do in a 
fix, says Glendale teen reader Darlene Balderas. 
</P>
<P>
Balderas, 14, retreats to her bedroom with teenzines in tow to relax from the 
rigors of passing through puberty. "I don't have to worry about things," she 
says of her escape into the magazines teeming with teen stars. 
</P>
<P>
Her 12-year-old sister, Alba, also is hooked, she says, adding: "My walls are 
covered with posters" pulled from the periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen-year-old Los Angeles gal-pals Tracey Andrews and Anna Perez catch a 
few zzz's with their teenzines under their pillows. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I'm telling you this," Anna confides, then giggles while 
standing at a grocery newsstand. "But I'm buying two of this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because somewhere in Bopland, TBB editors have -- oops! -- put Joe 
McIntyre, the fave babe among the NKOTB singers, and teen movie heartbreaker 
Corey Feldman back-to-back on the same page! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double Dilemma 
</P>
<P>
It's a double dilemma all too familiar to Bopsters everywhere. Laura Adelmann, 
15, of Cincinnati and Joanne Casale, 14, of Cranston, R.I., also have bought 
two copies of the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
But not to worry, Bopperoos! These kids are rolling in allowances! 
</P>
<P>
Laura saves her weekly $5 allowance and earnings from baby-sitting jobs to keep 
up with famous kids her age. This NKOTB-lover and secret admirer of teen 
heartthrobs Wil Wheaton, Corin (Corky) Nemec and Chad Allen has been a devoted 
teenzine reader for almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, as one of two Bop and TBB contest winners, Laura spent five 
days in Los Angeles meeting many of the teen personalities whose posters are 
plastered above her bed. "My friends were jealous of me! I'll be the talk of my 
school in September!" she says. 
</P>
<P>
Like Laura, perky 14-year-old Joanne and her 9-year-old sis, Adriana, spend 
their allowances on teenzines including Bop and TBB. Joanne likes the 
interviews with TV and music stars. But she's especially crazy for teen celeb 
guys who know how to have fun "but also go after what they want." 
</P>
<P>
"It's good that there are positive images for young people to follow," she 
says. "My friends and I are holding our breaths for the next issue!" 
</P>

JACKIE TAKES ANOTHER LOOK AT HOLLYWOOD WIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years ago, author Jackie Collins invented the term "Hollywood Wives" in her 
book of the same name. Fashion asked her to update her view of the type. 
</P>
<P>
As avant-garde Italian designer Franco Moschino said at his spring, 1989, 
clothes show, while his long-legged models strode the runway pouting as hard as 
they could: "No more shows. Fashion shows are out of fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah! My sentiments entirely. Women are fed up with eyeballing super-thin, 
super-tall, super-young models on whom a plastic garbage bag would look 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
After all, fashion is merely a state of mind. And the women who follow it 
slavishly usually end up looking ridiculous at best, or like a small army of 
clones at the worst. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the inspiration to write "Hollywood Wives." I was sitting in a 
glamorous Beverly Hills restaurant one lunchtime, and I glanced around. 
Immediately I was struck by the individual groups of women who all looked 
exactly the same. 
</P>
<P>
Identical dresses, shoes, jewelry, purses, even hair styles and manicures. 
Dedicated followers of fashion. The Hollywood wives. The definitive power 
behind the men. But not an original looker among them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of the Language 
</P>
<P>
And so a book was born. And a brand name. Hollywood wives, it seems, is now 
part of the language. 
</P>
<P>
Since I published the book in 1983, the look has changed, but not all that 
much. It starts with blond hair. From very yellow to blond with platinum 
streaks. And the makeup looks as if it is professionally done. It's always 
impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Hollywood wives are into Chanel, from head to toe. Chanel bags, shoes, 
and they're all fancied up with Chanel jewelry, most of it from the Chanel 
boutique on Rodeo Drive. I also see them shopping at Fred Hayman. Lina Lee is 
too hip, but they do go to Torrie Steele. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, these women don't dress alike by accident. They want it that way. 
Maybe it makes them feel secure that they aren't making any fashion mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
What they don't seem to understand is this: Fashion is a joke played upon 
women, usually by men. Ever since 1947, when Christian Dior inflicted his new 
look on the world, the media have been hooked and the women confused. Long 
skirts, short skirts, midi lengths, micro minis. High necklines, low plunges, 
backless, topless. Fashion dictates and females follow, whether they want to or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
However, now, as we head toward the '90s, and not a moment too soon, women are 
finally saying: "Hey, wait a minute. We can wear whatever we want, and get away 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Lucky Santangelo, the heroine of two of my books, "Chances" and "Lucky," has 
never followed fashion rules. She has always looked exactly as she pleases. A 
strong, sexy, uncompromising woman, now she reappears in "Lady Boss," the book 
I am currently writing. Lucky strides through her new role as owner of a major 
Hollywood studio, wearing black leather trench coats, form-fitting pin-stripe 
silk suits and drop-dead white dresses. Lucky dresses to dazzle -- feminine, 
sexy and most of all, assured. 
</P>
<P>
She likes huge, gold earrings, a mane of wild, tousled black hair and a 
square-shouldered jacket over an animal-print blouse, all balanced on extremely 
high, sexy heels. Her look is a combination, sexy and tough. 
</P>
<P>
And frankly, that's the way I see fashion going. Women can do anything they 
want. Power dressing is in. Female executives do not have to play down their 
sexuality. They don't wear frills and flounces either. Female studio dynamos 
look great. They no longer feel the need to dress the way business mores 
dictate. 
</P>
<P>
I love the fact that today everyone feels free enough to do what suits them. 
There are no rules anymore. Adolfo or Guess, Armani or the Gap. Who cares? 
</P>
<P>
And men are looking almost as good as women. The Hollywood husbands are 
breaking out in stylish Italian suits or merely looking casually hot in faded 
denim work shirts and old jeans. The pressure is off. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, what's in fashion today is anything you like. Anything except furs, 
which are definitely out. 
</P>
<P>
"Furs are worn by beautiful animals and ugly people," Franco Moschino says. 
Well, that may be taking it a little too far, but fake is definitely in. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, animal prints are a hot item, along with ethnic jewelry, Jean Paul 
Gaultier Western wear, Chanel shoes, hand-knit sweaters, riding pants, 
body-skimming dresses and cinch belts -- all the better to show off those 
worked-out, worked-on Hollywood bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, and pants are here to stay. Wide, narrow, loose, tight. And if you live 
in L.A., you have to include shorts and tanks and T's -- all the great casual 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all -- individuality is the thing. If it feels right -- wear it! 
Because when you get down to it -- fashion is you. And that's what is really 
important. Being yourself and loving it. 
</P>

LADIES ROOM LINES: PROF FLUSHES OUT THE TRUTH

<P>
Women always knew it. 
</P>
<P>
And now there's a woman who has gotten a big award from the American Society of 
Interior Designers for saying it: There are not enough toilets in public 
restrooms for women. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, as I stood in this line for the bathroom," recalls Sandra Rawls, "I 
thought that's just the way it is for women, but I started wondering why." 
</P>
<P>
From these little moments of frustration came the flush heard 'round the world. 
Rawls, an assistant professor of housing and interior design at the University 
of Missouri-Columbia, decided public bathrooms would be the subject of her 
doctoral dissertation. 
</P>
<P>
Hooking up with Virginia Tech housing professor Savannah Day, Rawls began 
collecting data at four sites in Virginia -- a highway rest area, a sports 
arena, an airport and a conference center. Using stopwatches, they timed 230 
men and 234 women, and, when subjects came out, asked them to fill out 
confidential questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sensitive Side' 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of research has a sensitive side," says Rawls, "so we stayed outside 
so as not to infringe on privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers set up a model of what might make people take longer, including 
what they did in there, what features they liked, whether they needed more 
toilets, whether there was a need for more places to put carried things, 
whether children slowed them down and how much time they spent on elimination, 
washing and grooming activities. 
</P>
<P>
What Rawls found was not surprising. Women take more than twice as long as men: 
three minutes versus 84 seconds. It has little to do with primping, a reason 
many people cite for the time difference. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she found that women take longer because of clothing restrictions, a 
lack of time-saving equipment and the accompaniment of small children. 
Pregnancy also is cited as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study Sparked Change 
</P>
<P>
Her award-winning study became the backbone of a successful effort last 
November by John A. Rollison III of Woodbridge, Va., to change that state's 
building code concerning the number of women's toilets. The new rules, which 
took effect in March, double the number of restrooms for women in new museums, 
stadiums and churches. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a lot of response from women across country," says Rollison, who 
has been dubbed the father of potty parity. "They all say we've done something 
positive for them and that something should have been done long before." 
</P>

New York has just passed similar legislation. And the National Conference of

Israel, which joined an elite club of world space powers last year by launching 
a communications satellite into orbit, said Thursday that it has asked to take 
part in the U.S. space program. 
</P>
<P>
Yuval Neeman, head of the Israel Space Agency, told Israel Radio that he raised 
the idea when he met Vice President Dan Quayle in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Neeman said Quayle, as chairman of the National Space Council, arranged for him 
to meet American space experts in two weeks.

OFFICIALS SAY CLIPPERS' PLANS WON'T SET BACK ARENA PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Competing plans to build indoor arenas in Anaheim and Santa Ana will not be 
affected by this week's announcement that the Los Angeles Clippers basketball 
team probably will not be moving to Orange County, officials involved with the 
projects said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither city was counting on a lease with the Clippers as a condition of 
building an arena, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This really doesn't represent any kind of setback," Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jim Ruth, assistant city manager in Anaheim: "It was never our intention 
to bring the Clippers to Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were seen as Orange County's best chance to acquire a professional 
sports franchise, since both the NBA and the NHL do not plan to expand in the 
next few years. Clippers owner Donald Sterling occasionally had expressed 
interest in moving his team out of Los Angeles. But on Wednesday, Sterling 
welcomed an offer from private developers to replace the Clippers' current 
home, the Los Angeles Sports Arena, with a new $100-million facility in 
exchange for a 30-year lease with the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feasibility Questioned 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles facility would be built by two of the three companies that are 
financing the proposed Santa Ana arena -- MCA Inc. and Spectacor Management 
Group -- prompting speculation about whether the companies would be prepared to 
pour nearly $200 million into building similar arenas only 30 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't sound very feasible," said Neal Papiano, the lawyer for the 
development group that is financing the competing plan for an $85-million arena 
northeast of Anaheim Stadium, "but I guess stranger things have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Guanci of King-Guanci Development Co., the developer for the Santa Ana 
arena, planned for Edinger Avenue and Lyon Street, said the proposed Los 
Angeles arena will not jeopardize financing for the 20,000-seat facility in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We do understand that an NBA or NHL team is important, but there are other 
ways to be successful," Guanci said. "It was never the intention of the 
partnership to lure the Clippers. We will be out there doing our best to entice 
an NHL or NBA team to our area." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is some financial risk involved in building an arena without a 
commitment from a professional sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's economically sound," said former Major League Baseball 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, who now operates the Ueberroth Corp. in Newport 
Beach. "In my own opinion, it's always the franchise first." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, NBA and NHL spokesmen say new franchises will be scarce in the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely no plans right now to expand," said NBA spokesman Brian 
McIntyre. The league added two teams last year in Miami and Charlotte, S.C., 
and will add two more next year in Minnesota and Orlando, Fla., he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of luring an existing NBA franchise from another 
city, McIntyre said, "There are no teams that have any plans to move right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre declined to speculate about whether the NBA would even permit a third 
team in the Los Angeles-area market, a decision that would be unprecedented in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
At the NHL, spokesman Gerry Helper said, "Any talk of expansion by our league 
is premature at this time." The last time the NHL expanded was in 1979, when 
four teams from the World Hockey Assn. were added to the league, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if one or both arenas are built without a commitment from a professional 
sports franchise, Orange County is likely to acquire another team in the 
not-too-distant future because of the area's market potential, several industry 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be very surprised if there isn't over the next five years more than one 
major sports stadium built in Orange County," Ueberroth said.

MAYOR IS FIRM ON NO FUNDS FOR AIDING ILLEGALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Rejecting pleas from more than two dozen charities Thursday, Costa Mesa Mayor 
Peter F. Buffa refused to back down from his support for a controversial city 
policy of withholding money from any group that aids illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 people gathered at St. Joachim's Catholic Church where representatives 
of various charities argued that the new policy would be a costly, bureaucratic 
burden and lead to discrimination against Latinos. Under the policy, they said, 
they would be acting as federal officials because they would be, in effect, 
enforcing immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa rejected those arguments and urged the charities to cooperate with the 
city. After the meeting, however, he said he might reconsider his position if 
the federal government withholds money from the city because of its policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Week's Vote 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 3 to 2 last week to withhold funds from any organization 
-- except those providing medical aid -- that assists undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Hunsinker, a spokesman for the Someone Who Cares soup kitchen, told Buffa 
that everyone in need should be helped, regardless of where they are from. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to throw the baby out with the bath water because all of those 
people are American," he said. "And it's un-American to not help your fellow 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Green, an attorney for the Fair Housing Council of Orange County, read a 
statement that said the policy "forces service agencies to make discriminatory 
assumptions about national origin without training and without criteria." 
</P>
<P>
And then, David Quezada, the executive director of the Fair Housing Council who 
appeared in jeans and a pale blue shirt,addressed Buffa in Spanish to 
illustrate how difficult it would be to identify illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He'll Consider Arguments 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot reach the conclusion that someone is illegal without forcing these 
agencies to discriminate or stereotype," Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa, who voted for the policy along with Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed 
Glasgow, said he would consider the charities' arguments when the council 
decides how to implement and enforce the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The council deals in generalities," he said. "It's what follows in terms of 
implementation that is important." 
</P>
<P>
However, before that can happen, Buffa said, city officials must wait for a 
report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is 
reviewing the policy for possible conflicts with federal guidelines barring 
discrimination on the basis of national origin. The policy could jeopardize the 
city's receipt of Community 
</P>
<P>
Development Block Grant money. 
</P>
<P>
The city received $809,000 in block grant this year, with about 15% of that 
targeted 
</P>
<P>
for charities, according to City Manager Allan L. Roeder, who said that if HUD 
money is restricted, the policy could still apply to organizations receiving 
funds from local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Cecile Beaven, a spokeswoman for HUD's office in Los Angeles, said that the 
agency has just begun studying Costa Mesa's policy and that she could not 
predict when it will be done. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Buffa said HUD's withholding of funds would be a "very 
powerful motivator" for him to change his vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to continue any policy if it proves to be ineffective or a 
crushing burden," he said . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Them to Comply 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of many groups on hand Thursday said they would not sign 
contracts agreeing to comply with the policy. Buffa, pointing out that the 
council has not decided what action the city would take in such cases, said he 
expects the groups to comply. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not convinced that they are final in their decision," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa and supporters contend that the policy is needed because the federal 
government hasn't been able to stem the tide of illegal aliens. This, he said, 
would be a way of stabilizing the situation in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a total failure of the federal government," he said. "They deliberately 
refuse to deal with it. Once they are across the border, it is a local 
government's problem. The federal government is off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was organized by the episcopal vicar for Hispanic affairs of 
the Diocese of Orange, the Hispanic Development Council of United Way and the 
Orange County Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Father Jaime Soto of the Diocese of Orange said he was "disappointed 
that we can't get some more clear answers from the mayor. I'm hoping that it 
will be in the city's best interest to change this policy. 
</P>
<P>
"People do not volunteer their time to then be burdened with bureaucratic 
duties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union has considered legal action but is waiting 
for the HUD report, according to attorney Rebecca Jurado.

MIGRANT CHILDREN SAMPLE COLLEGE LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
YOUTHS LEARN OF EDUCATION OPTIONS 
</P>

<P>
Pedro Flores, a Mexican-born 14-year-old accustomed to sharing a tiny bedroom 
with his parents and four brothers and sisters, spent his first night at Cal 
State Fullerton tossing and turning. 
</P>
<P>
"The room seemed so big, and at first I couldn't sleep with just one other guy 
there," Flores said. But after three weeks, "now I sleep well . . . and we 
usually stay up talking until midnight." 
</P>
<P>
Flores and 29 other ninth-graders, all children of current and former migrant 
workers, have been immersed not only in college dormitory life but also in 
learning English, math and computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
The project, entitled Basic Education Skills for Tomorrow (BEST), is among the 
first in the nation to pair counselors, who were raised in migrant family 
households, with a younger generation of migrant youths in a college setting. 
It is perhaps the most ambitious program in the Southland aimed at the 45% of 
Latinos who drop out of high school before the 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to dangle the college experience in front of these kids so they know 
that finishing high school is an option," said Margarett Lewis, assistant 
director of Migrant Education in Orange and San Diego counties. "We also have 
to convince migrant parents that they have to hold on a little longer before 
they send their kids to work." 
</P>
<P>
Under a $32,000 grant from the Department of Education, the project began in 
June with the selection of 30 youths from Orange County schools. Most were shy, 
poor academic performers and termed "at risk" -- likely to drop out. Many spoke 
only Spanish and some had only recently crossed the border from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The migrant community in Orange County is all at risk," said Dr. Isaac 
Cardenas, director of the Chicano studies department at Cal State Fullerton, 
who was chosen in mid-June to lead the program. "We wanted to take the kids 
before they drop out and give them role models." 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, himself the son of migrant workers, decided to hire resident advisers 
who also had lived through poverty, language problems, and transience. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started looking for staff, we wanted advisers who could communicate 
with the parents and become leaders for the kids," Cardenas said. "We wanted 
them to go to the kids' homes, see how they live, and make the parents feel 
confident about what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
In late June and early July, the counselors visited the families and found some 
reluctance about the program. Parents of the girls, who traditionally are more 
sheltered in Latino homes, were especially skeptical, Cardenas said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, most of them agreed. On the first day, parents and their children 
arrived to see the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of them, coming into a nice new condo with a microwave oven and 
everything else was culture shock," said chief adviser George Herrera, son of 
Mexican immigrants who is studying for a master's degree in fine arts at 
Fullerton. "Some of them come from alcoholic homes, tough situations, and this 
really freaked out many of them." 
</P>
<P>
At first the new students were shy, said counselor Julia Amavisca, a 
34-year-old Cal State Fresno graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really afraid when we began here, but slowly they have started to 
get more comfortable. Now, when we all sit down with our junk food in the 
evening, they are starting to ask how much did it cost to go to college, what 
do you want to do and how can we do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that means the program is working." 
</P>
<P>
The four teachers in the program all speak Spanish, and several also come from 
immigrant families. Students say that use of Spanish and the personal attention 
they receive make the classroom more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually in school, the teachers speak only a little Spanish and I speak only a 
little English," said Pedro Flores, who came to the United States three years 
ago from Puebla, Mexico. "Here, everybody is Mexican and so we can talk 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Flores and Rosalina Rodriguez, another student who arrived only eight months 
ago from Mexico, have excelled on the computer, said teacher Clement Mendez. 
Both students have difficulty in school because of their limited command of 
English but say the program has spurred their interest in computers. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a teacher of computers when I grow up," Rodriguez said. "Here I'm 
learning to do things that I never thought that I could do." 
</P>
<P>
When the last class ends today, directors will begin planning for next year. 
However, the migrant education program, which includes tutoring during the 
school year, will include more students, but with no additional funding. 
Officials have started to consider streamlining other programs to prevent 
harming BEST. 
</P>
<P>
While decisions are being made by administrators, students say they hope that 
the program will resume next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Latino kids have never seen the inside of a dormitory," said Leticia 
Rodriguez, 14, who was born in El Salvador and now lives in Garden Grove. "Most 
programs are for American people, but this lets us know we can really do 
something."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
JURY FINDS MAN GUILTY IN '81 MURDER OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tustin man was convicted Thursday of murder in the 1981 death of an 
18-year-old Carson woman whose body has never been found. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Tracy Lee Stewart wept as the six-man, six-woman jury in Los 
Angeles Superior Court declared Robert Wayne Beckett Jr. guilty of killing her 
on Aug. 9, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett, 28, wearing jeans and cowboy boots and shackled at the feet, showed no 
emotion as the verdict was read. But he laughed and joked with bailiffs as he 
was led out of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing has been delayed pending a probation report, which is due Aug. 31. 
He could be sentenced to 25 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, Beckett and his father, Robert Beckett Sr., were charged 
with the woman's murder. But after the son backed out of an agreement to 
testify against his father, Beckett Sr. was released, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dale 
Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett Jr. was the last person seen with Stewart, when he picked her up at her 
Carson residence for a date and drove to his father's Torrance-area home. His 
arrest came after his conviction in 1985 for felonious assault on a woman 
friend in Colorado, for which he served two years there. While in prison, 
Beckett talked to authorities about a murder in Carson, and detectives 
eventually were able to connect him with Stewart's disappearance, according to 
law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart telephoned her parents on the day of the murder to tell them that she 
was on a date with someone named Robbie, authorities said. She was never seen 
again.

OUSTED SCHOOL CHIEF MAY GET $120,000; 
</P>
<P>
BUENA PARK BOARD AGREES TO PAYMENTS IF EX-SUPERINTENDENT FINDS NO JOB IN 1 YEAR 
</P>

<P>
The Buena Park School District Board of Trustees has agreed to pay ousted Supt. 
Richard F. Cochran up to $120,000, but only if he fails to find another job in 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual terms of the buyout of Cochran's contract followed disclosure that 
he collected one year of severance pay from a prior job during his first year 
on the job in Buena Park, according to a lawyer for the district. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Cochran's dismissal was not disclosed. He had been placed on 
paid leave in May, when his three-year contract came up for a regularly 
scheduled review. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had received a satisfactory evaluation then, the contract would have 
been extended," said Spencer Covert, a Santa Ana attorney who is representing 
the board. "I'm not at liberty to discuss the underlying reasons for this 
agreement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The board agreed to pay Cochran, 50, superintendent since July, 1987, his 
regular $70,000 through July, 1990, plus another $50,000 if he fails to find 
another job by that time. Cochran's contract with the district guaranteed him 
his job through July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Covert said it was "not atypical" to buy out the last year of a 
superintendent's contract. 
</P>
<P>
Board members declined to explain the termination, except to say that it was a 
confidential "personnel matter" between employer and employee. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has been very closemouthed about the situation," said Joyce Wills, 
president of the Buena Park Teachers Assn. "None of the employees knew what was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Lloyd G. Davis said the agreement requires board members to refer 
questions about the reasons for Cochran's dismissal to Covert, the board 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that a school district has paid Cochran not to work. 
</P>
<P>
The first time was in June, 1987, when the board of the Murray School District 
in Alameda County bought out the final year of Cochran's contract for $65,000, 
only to see him begin work the next week for Buena Park at a salary of $66,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
Covert said the new agreement is carefully worded to end payments to Cochran if 
he gets another job or fails to report that he is a finalist for another 
position in the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Of the overlapping salaries that Cochran drew in 1987-88, Patricia Ferreira, a 
board member of the Murray School District, said he "used innocence at both 
ends to his advantage to draw a double salary. . . . The usual situation is 
that one job is resigned." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cochran nor his attorney, Charles Field of Riverside, could be reached 
for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Townsend, formerly an assistant superintendent, has served as acting 
superintendent of the district, which has almost 4,000 students in kindergarten 
through eighth grade.

CANDIDATE FOR CHAPMAN PRESIDENCY TO VISIT CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of Emerson College in Boston is scheduled to tour the Chapman 
College campus in Orange next week as one of three candidates seeking to become 
Chapman's 11th president, the chairman of the college's search committee 
confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Duryea, a Chapman trustee, said Allen Koenig, president of Emerson since 
1979, will be on campus on Monday and Tuesday as the 128-year-old private 
college continues a search that has taken more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig's visit is part of "the normal process of investigating candidates," 
Duryea said, adding that Koenig has not been offered any position. 
</P>
<P>
Interim President James Doti is the other contender identified by university 
officials to fill the spot vacated when G.T. (Buck) Smith left the post in 
March, 1988, said Pamela Ezell, a college spokeswoman. The other candidate has 
not been identified by the 12-member search committee, Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
The new president would oversee a $23-million expansion announced in May, 
including a 200-bed dormitory, an academic building and a student union. 
</P>
<P>
The college's master plan calls for buildings in some campus areas to reach 
heights of 62 feet, and some nearby residents have complained that high-rise 
buildings would not be in harmony with the neighborhood of Victorian and early 
California-style, one- and two-story homes and businesses. The college has been 
based in the Old Towne district of Orange since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
The new president also faces financial difficulties in the athletic department, 
which cut six teams in January to save money. Doti supports a move to make 
Chapman, a Division II school, into a Division III school, which does not offer 
athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said most new presidents traditionally have come from outside the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had too many presidents, so it's hard to really find a trend," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig would not comment on his trip to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Doti was on vacation through Wednesday and could not be reached for comment, 
his secretary said Thursday. The former dean of Chapman's business school has 
been at the college since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig also taught mass education while at Emerson, a liberal-arts college with 
a strong focus on communications that has about the same enrollment -- 2,185 
last year -- as Chapman's. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to the Boston school, Doti was vice president of Marycrest 
College in Davenport, Iowa, and vice president of university relations at 
Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
He is the president of the New England chapter of the National Academy of 
Television Arts and Sciences. He has written about labor relations in the 
broadcast industry and higher education and is a former editor of Educational 
Broadcasting Review. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, 50, a Los Angeles native, received a bachelor's degree in sociology and 
telecommunications from USC, a masters's degree in speech communication from 
Stanford University and a doctorate in speech communication from Northwestern 
University in Evanston, Ill.

BABBITT REACHES THE FENCES TO GET CONNIE MACK SERIES RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a total surprise that Troy Babbitt set the record for home runs in 
the Connie Mack World Series this week. He has hit his share of home runs. He 
had five last spring for Western High Schools, even though he was better known 
for his line drives. 
</P>
<P>
But five home runs in four games? 
</P>
<P>
It's true. Babbitt set the tournament record with his performance for the 
Orange County Cardinals, who were eliminated Wednesday from the Connie Mack 
World Series in Farmington, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
During the Connie Mack regular season, Babbitt, a second baseman and shortstop, 
hit one home run in 20 games. He added another two weeks ago to help the 
Cardinals win the Connie Mack Western Regionals at Chabot College in Hayward, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
And then this week . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This is unreal," he said during his streak. "I've never done anything like 
this before. All I'm trying to do is hit the ball hard and it's going over the 
fence." 
</P>
<P>
Babbitt's power assault started in the first game Saturday, when he hit two 
home runs over the right-field fence, 330 feet away. He was five for five as 
the Cardinals defeated Madison Heights, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Babbitt couldn't remember if he'd ever hit two home runs before in a game. 
"Maybe in Little League," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal assistant coach Dave Demarest said of the first game: "He just went 
off on a tear. Every ball he hit was a shot. The pitching is good here, but 
he's a good hitter and he kept it up." 
</P>
<P>
Babbitt hit another home run in the Cardinals' second tournament game Monday. 
He got No. 4 Tuesday in a loss to Cincinnati. On Wednesday, he hit a solo home 
run in the seventh, but the Cardinals lost that game to Cincinnati, too, and 
were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the series nine for 14 and then headed home to get ready for 
college. He'll start Monday at Cypress College.

THOMPSONS DEVELOPED THEIR OWN ATHLETIC TRADITION AT HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An athletic era ended at Huntington Beach High School when Andy Thompson 
accepted his diploma in June. 
</P>
<P>
For his parents, Dick and Sally, it marked the end of 14 years of booster club 
meetings, Friday night basketball games, football bus trips and all-night 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
After traveling all over the state to watch their five sons play sports, Dick 
and Sally now will have to fly to see Andy, who will attend Hawaii-Hilo on a 
basketball scholarship this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy really surprised me going to Hawaii," Dick said. "With all the kids gone, 
this will be a big change for us. But I'm sure we'll make it to the islands to 
catch a few of Andy's games." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy, now 30, was the first of the six Thompsons to attend the school, but 
stuck with cheerleading and student council instead of sports. The family's 
athletic contributions started with Rico, now 27, and followed with Bobby, 25; 
Billy, 24; Danny, 23 and Andy, 18. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy leaving really hit Dad hard," Kathy said. "Dad lived for those games." 
</P>
<P>
Dick and Sally, both 53, have logged thousands of miles following their sons' 
high school and college athletic careers. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, they would attend Billy and Bobby's high school basketball 
games on Friday nights, then drive all night to watch Rico play basketball at 
Stanislaus State in Turlock the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an eight- or nine-hour drive," said Dick, president of a hardware 
firm in Norwalk. "But it was a great experience." 
</P>
<P>
For 13 of the past 14 years, they watched at least one of their sons dribble a 
basketball or run with a football at Huntington Beach. The only school year a 
Thompson wasn't listed in the Oilers' yearbook was 1984-85, when Danny was a 
redshirt freshman at UCLA and Andy was an eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Miller, the Oilers' basketball coach since 1976, watched the Thompson 
brothers mature from inexperienced freshmen into confident seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"After all these years I have become very spoiled with having a Thompson in my 
program," Miller said. "I'm going to miss seeing Dick and Sally. I know I'm 
going to miss the leadership and character each (boy) displayed on and off the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Danny, the best known of the brothers after playing fullback and tailback at 
UCLA the past four years, said the competition between family members helped 
them improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Rico excelled in basketball and set the example for us," said Danny, who works 
with an aluminum distribution company. "By the time I arrived, everyone was 
saying, 'Here's another Thompson; what's he going to do?' Then, when Andy came 
around, everyone expected him to be good. 
</P>
<P>
"We were competitive since we were young. We learned from each others' 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers often confused the brothers, who have short, brown hair and thick, 
shaggy eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the older teachers called me Billy," Danny said. "Some called me 
Bobby, because I was slow. I didn't mind. It was fun to be labeled one of my 
brothers because I looked up to them." 
</P>
<P>
Rico was the best athlete in the family, Danny said. Rico played football, 
basketball and baseball in high school and later became a Division III academic 
All-American in basketball at Stanislaus State. He helped Stanislaus reach the 
Division III Final Four his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Sally said Rico, now a teacher and basketball coach at San Marcos High School, 
"always led the pack" when he was younger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always agreed with Rose Kennedy, who said, 'If you train the first one 
right, the others will follow,' " Sally said. "He's really a good teacher. He 
relates to the kids well because of his brothers. They aren't afraid to take 
their problems to him." 
</P>
<P>
Rico probably would have been recruited by larger schools had it not been for a 
blood disorder between his junior and senior years, Dick said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rico, Bobby played football, basketball and baseball at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
After playing cornerback in high school, Bobby switched to strong safety and 
played two years at Golden West College and two seasons at Sacramento State. At 
just under six feet tall, Bobby was too small for a linebacker and too slow for 
a cornerback, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick said Bobby, now a sales representative in a Phoenix hardware company, was 
a "fierce competitor." 
</P>
<P>
"I always taught my sons to give their all," said Dick, who played basketball 
and football at the University of Massachusetts. "I didn't care if they 
excelled. It was the effort I was looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Away from the playing field, Bobby was the most easygoing of the brothers. He 
kept everyone relaxed, Danny said. 
</P>
<P>
"He played football really loose," Danny said. "But he was a devastating 
hitter. I still have people come up to me and say, 'Hey, you're Bobby's 
brother. He hit me so hard once he gave me a headache.' " 
</P>
<P>
While Bobby relied on power and competitiveness to earn a college scholarship, 
Billy used finesse. He gave up football in his junior year to concentrate on 
his favorite sport, basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Billy, a senior, and Danny, a junior, led the Oilers to the Sunset 
League title and their first Southern Section basketball playoff appearance in 
five years. They won two playoff games before losing in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Billy's tricky ballhandling and pinpoint passing fit perfectly into the Oilers' 
offense, and those skills carried him to a basketball career at Biola College. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good basketball player," Dick said. "But he wasn't a good shooter. To 
play at the bigger schools, you had to put the ball in the hole. But he had 
other skills. He was very, very quick." 
</P>
<P>
Billy, who now works with a hardware company in Norwalk, had some deceptive 
moves away from the basketball court, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He always got me into trouble," Danny said. "He would start something and then 
he would weasel out of it. I guess he was my role model. But he got straight 
A's in school, and I got straight Cs. Everything he did, I never quite measured 
up to." 
</P>
<P>
Some measured Danny by a different set of standards. The Times' Orange County 
football player of the year in 1984, Danny left the school with a new 
self-image. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, he scored three touchdowns and gained 220 yards in 23 carries 
against Ocean View. That victory ended the Oilers' six-year, 35-game Sunset 
League losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, he scored twice and gained 209 yards as Huntington Beach beat 
Edison, an Orange County powerhouse. The last time the Oilers had beaten Edison 
-- in 1969 -- Danny was 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Beating Edison was a big highlight of my high school career," he said. "So was 
the 1983 basketball season. That was a great team. I've never played on a team 
where there was so much friendship." 
</P>
<P>
After the success in 1983, the Oilers' basketball team struggled in 1984. 
Miller promoted four junior varsity players to the varsity, then told Danny 
that if he quit basketball to concentrate on the upcoming track season, it 
would be OK with him. 
</P>
<P>
Danny said no. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted no part of it," Miller said. "That's the way they (Thompsons) are. 
We had up and down years, but they never quit. If they start something, they 
want to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when family members doubted if Danny would even get started in 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't as interested in sports as my brothers were," he said. "They 
would watch games on TV and then go outside and play. I shied away. I was a 
daydreamer and a loner." 
</P>
<P>
Danny calls himself the family's "black sheep." He got into mischief when he 
was young, which turned into trouble when he grew older. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of things I can't talk about," he said. "I guess I was a curious 
kid. I tried a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Danny began channeling his negative energy into something 
positive -- athletics. 
</P>
<P>
He earned a scholarship to UCLA, redshirted his freshman year and then 
struggled to find a niche in the backfield. He played tailback, fullback and 
wingback, often blocking for Eric Ball and Gaston Green. 
</P>
<P>
Danny carried the ball only 55 times for 307 yards in his four seasons with the 
Bruins. He caught nine passes for 39 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
One of those touchdown catches came on Christmas Day at the Aloha Bowl. 
Thompson caught a tipped pass in the end zone while lying on his back to help 
the Bruins beat Florida 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
"That has to rank as the highlight of my college career," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Danny struggled in his college career, Andy was finding that life in the 
twilight of his brother's career at Huntington Beach had a sunny side, too. 
</P>
<P>
Andy played football, basketball and ran the 300 intermediate hurdles his 
freshman and sophomore years. He competed in football and basketball as a 
junior before dropping football his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Andy averaged 10.4 points a game and led the team in free-throw 
percentage (.776) and assists (125) while helping the Oilers to the Sunset 
League championship. Andy, a point guard, was named to the All-Sunset League 
first team and played in the Orange County All-Star basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy was far removed from the rest of us because he was so much younger," 
Danny said. "He always hung around me and tried to emulate me. I was the leader 
of his clan of friends in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their 12-year difference in age, Kathy thought of Andy as more of a 
son than a brother. 
</P>
<P>
"My children (Lindsey, 9, and Robert, 5) treated Andy more like a brother than 
an uncle," she said. "They would really go at it." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy said she has lost track of the number of games she has attended, 
following both her brothers' careers and her husband, Steve Brooks, who coaches 
boys' basketball at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"People always ask me if it's tough being a coach's wife," she said. "But I was 
raised in an athletic environment. I think it's exciting. There's ups and 
downs. There's always something different happening." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy, Sally and Dick won't have any trouble picking who to cheer for if Los 
Alamitos plays Huntington Beach in basketball again. The game will no longer be 
a family affair, something Sally said they will miss. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we still have Steve's team to watch," she said.

SHEFF DRIVES IN KEY RUN AS U.S. DEFEATS TAIWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Sheff, who graduated from Laguna Hills High School in June, drove in the 
game-winning run as the U.S. team defeated Taiwan, 8-3, Thursday in the World 
Junior Baseball tournament at Trois-Rivieres, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the U.S. a 5-0 record in pool play. The U.S will play 
Australia (4-1) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff went one for three and had the game-winning RBI with a sacrifice fly in 
the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 3-3, with no outs and runners on second and third when 
Sheff hit his sacrifice fly. The U.S. scored two more runs in that inning and 
two more in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff also scored a run and stole a base.

ATARI MUST PAY BENEFITS TO 2 FIRED FEDERATED EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atari Corp. was ordered Thursday to pay severance and other benefits totaling 
about $600,000 to two top officials of the Federated Group who were fired 
shortly after Atari bought the retail chain two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Atari officials had tried to convince an Orange County Superior Court judge 
that the two executives had forfeited the money through questionable business 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Jack K. Mandel was not persuaded by that argument. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling only minutes after the four-day trial ended, he awarded former Federated 
president Keith Powell of Laguna Hills about $260,000 in severance pay and 
former vice president Merrill Lyons of Los Angeles $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we've been exonerated," said Powell, now head of a door and window 
company in San Juan Capistrano. "I'm just glad I had my day in court. All the 
facts are finally in, and clearly we didn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Powell's and Lyons' life insurance policies will resume, and the men will also 
receive interest on the severance payments, bringing the total value of the 
award to about $600,000, their attorney said. The judge did, however, deny 
punitive damages against Atari, a computer maker based in Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
The case is one of the first in a number of legal disputes arising from Atari's 
purchase of Federated for $67 million. Atari has since soured on Federated, as 
Federated's losses have continued. 
</P>
<P>
Federated is now for sale, and about 15 of its 65 stores nationwide have closed 
in the past few months. Atari had hoped Federated would be a retailer for its 
computers and video games. 
</P>
<P>
In the broadest of its legal claims, still pending in federal court in Northern 
California, Atari argues that Federated officials and others close to the deal 
duped Atari into buying a company that had been overvalued by as much as $43 
million. 
</P>
<P>
A similar line of argument was presented in the Orange County case. Atari 
Chairman Jack Tramiel and other Atari officials testified that they were never 
made aware of, and therefore probably would never have agreed to, several 
business decisions Powell and Lyons made at the time the acquisition was being 
completed. Powell and Lyons were fired a few months after Atari bought 
Federated. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions included the transfer at favorable terms of an $800,000 
condominium to Federated commercial personality Shadoe Stevens and a $1-million 
payment to the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. for its role in the 
Atari acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Mandel, in an interview after the ruling, said that Powell and Lyons "acted 
reasonably" in their business decisions and that Atari wrongly refused to honor 
legitimate severance agreements. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in denying punitive damages against Atari, Mandel said that 
Atari officials may have had reason to question those business decisions and 
that they did not act in bad faith in refusing to pay severance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the denial of punitive damages, Powell described Mandel's ruling as 
"bittersweet." "It's a disappointment to the extent that we still have a lot of 
legal fees to pay, but we never had great expectations" about collecting 
punitive damages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Atari could not be reached for comment after the ruling.

'LITTLE SHOP' STILL THE GIDDIEST OF MINOR MUSICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buena Park Civic Theatre's "Little Shop of Horrors" can be strident at times, 
and slow-moving at others, but it still is a reasonably diverting treatment to 
this giddiest of minor musicals. 
</P>
<P>
You visit "Little Shop" to get dizzy with its cornball rock score and daft 
plot, based on the infamous Roger Corman movie of the same name. All we want 
are decent, strutting voices, a little character in the characters of Audrey 
and Seymour, and a big, hungry mouth for Audrey II, the man-eating plant from 
Planet X. 
</P>
<P>
Director Gary Krinke gets by with a cast that, for the most part, is more 
competent than accomplished. But it's enough, though barely -- if you like 
"Little Shop" (and I always have), there's fun to be had, and Krinke taps into 
that fun a fair amount of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda Blais is a rather restrained Audrey, avoiding the kinetic yammering that 
has marked other interpretations. But she nonetheless is able to give us an 
Audrey that is part adorable Kewpie doll and soulful dits. Her voice, while not 
a knockout, is the production's best, although there's not a lot of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
As her soul mate and the young nebbish that discovers (and feeds) Audrey II, 
Kevan Quinn's Seymour is pretty standard. He's innocent, insecure and dorky. 
Quinn is satisfying, but not remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said for most of the rest of the cast, including the voice 
behind Audrey II, Roland Holliday Hills. He booms just fine -- yep, we do get 
the idea that this is one starving, hostile plant -- but there aren't any 
surprises brought to the role. It's about time directors and actors started to 
come up with new twists for Audrey II. 
</P>
<P>

ON LABOR DAY, KDOC FIXIN' TO AIR 'HILLBILLIES' MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KDOC-TV, Channel 56 in Orange County, is climbing aboard the marathon 
bandwagon, scheduling seven hours of back-to-back "Beverly Hillbillies" 
episodes for Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else has had marathons," said KDOC spokeswoman Tricia Krause, 
recalling full days worth of "The Twilight Zone" and "I Love Lucy" on other 
stations in the area. "So we thought we'd try one too." "Hillbillies," which is 
shown on KDOC every day at 6 p.m., was chosen because it's so "upbeat," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon will be "more or less a test," she added: If it proves successful, 
the station may do more of them. 
</P>
<P>
To promote the marathon, which will run from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sept. 4, 
"Hillbillies" star Buddy Ebsen will make several appearances around the county 
this Tuesday. His stops will include the Anaheim City Hall and the Movieland 
Wax Museum in Buena Park, where he will be photographed on a replica of the 
"Hillbillies" set. Ebsen also will visit the KDOC studio to help select some of 
the 14 episodes for the marathon and to tape some of his recollections of 
making the series. 
</P>
<P>
Ebsen, who was a well-known hoofer early in his career, went on to small-screen 
fame, co-starring with Fess Parker in "Davy Crockett" before "Hillbillies" and, 
afterward, in "Barnaby Jones." MARK I. PINSKY

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Z Pizza, 30902 S. Coast Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-4949. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
7th Heaven, 3333 Bear St. in the Crystal Court, Costa Mesa. (714) 668-9464. 
Open Mondays through Fridays 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturdays 9 to 6, Sundays 10 to 
6. 
</P>
<P>
Z Pizza serves eccentric, internationally accented pizzas that have plenty of 
flash and flavors. Particularly engaging is a Moroccan style pizza with 
eggplant and pine nuts, and the Pissaladiere Nicoise, a cheeseless pie with 
anchovies and Provencal herbs. The chewy, fragrant crusts are mini-masterpieces 
all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
7th Heaven is a movable feast, a full-blown urban takeout emporium for grown-up 
tastes. Don't miss such specialties as Chinese lacquered chicken, jalapeno corn 
pudding or a dazzling array of trendy salads. There are abundant pastes and 
cheeses for the picnic basket. Desserts like bread pudding and rich chocolate 
cookies are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's Seafood Grill, 3330 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-2400. Open daily 
from 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's Seafood Grill made a killer impression on me the first time I ate 
there, but the year was 1976 and the city was San Francisco. That was then, 
this is now. Today, in a stunning new Coast Mesa location, the romance wears a 
bit thin. Good oysters, rich clam chowder and a good wine list make for 
pleasant beginnings but the fresh mesquite-grilled fish is often devoid of 
flavor, as one would expect in such a high-volume operation. Save room for the 
homemade desserts and the good espresso. 
</P>
<P>
Stix, 28251 Crown Valley Parkway at the Center at Ranch Miguel, Laguna Niguel. 
(714) 831-7849. Open 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. weekdays, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Stix is a bright, airy, mirror-lined new Chinese restaurant where the cooking 
offers few surprises but is straightforward and safe: no MSG, high-quality oils 
like peanut and sesame, you get it. The various kung paos, pan fried dumplings 
and twice-cooked pork may lack the hotness and brio they have in Chinatown or 
Monterey Park, but added color and crunch make up for it. 
</P>
<P>
Gustav Anders, (South Coast Plaza Village), 3610 S. Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. 
(714) 668-1737. Open daily, 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Gustav Anders is a recent arrival from La Jolla, where it received critical 
raves from customers and critics alike. Here, in a beautiful setting, it fails 
to live up to its promise. Service is spotty and disorganized. The kitchen 
shows only occasional flashes of the brilliance for which Anders once was 
known. Chef Ulf Strandberg has a deft hand with smoked fish, pate, and salads. 
But his main dishes, such as the insipid deep fried sweetbread or too-sharp 
rabbit livers, are disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Mayur, 2931 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-6622. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 11:30 p.m.; Saturdays 5:30 
to 11:30 p.m.; Sundays noon to 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Breads like naan and aijwan paratha are perfect, steaming from the tandoor. 
Fish tikka comes dripping spice. Lamb vindaloo, a Goan preparation with 
vinegar, chili and potato, is hot, fragrant and well balanced. Be wary of the 
oily vegetable dishes and the unctuous service. 
</P>
<P>
Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal Beach. (213) 596-2199. Open Mondays 
through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 10 p.m.; Saturdays noon to 
3:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 10:30 p.m.; Sundays noon to 3:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 9:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A swank Seal Beach grill and pasta house, Spaghettini gets by largely on 
beauty: The food is somewhat spotty. Appetizers have little character, but 
pizzas are full grown and yeasty, fresh from an oak-burning brick oven. Pastas 
are made fresh daily but are not necessarily well prepared. Linguini clams 
turns out to be a bowl of sticky glop. It's best to stick with items from the 
restaurant's mesquite grill, like the perfectly blackened veal chop or the 
excellent mixed grill. 
</P>
<P>
El Ranchito, 1351-H Beach Blvd., La Habra. (213) 943-6020. Open Sundays through 
Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Manana, 17171 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 963-8673. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
La Salsa, Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, Fashion Island, Newport Beach ((714) 
640-4289) and Santa Ana MainPlace ((714) 543-9524). Open weekdays, 9 a.m. to 9 
p.m.; weekdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, has his secret Mexican haunt, where the chilies are hotter 
or the tortillas fresher. El Ranchito is the place for carnitas, chunked pork 
marinated in lemon and garlic, and for some of the most toothsome handmade 
tortillas in the area. Larry Cano's Manana specializes in fajitas, giant 
portions that easily feed two, loaded with trimmed meats, red and yellow 
peppers, tomatoes and carmelized onion. Best of all is La Salsa, a humble food 
stand dispensing antojitos, soft tacos, quesadillas and Mexican sandwiches. 
Meats here are impeccable, accompaniments rapturous.

Gemmell's, 3000 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 751-1074. Open Mondays through 
Fridays, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays, 6 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 You've seen it all before: the quiet, understated rooms, the tables draped 
like ballroom gowns, the silver domes, the brandy cart. At Gemmell's, thank 
heaven, it all makes sense. Treat yourself to an evening here, feasting on such 
specialties as goose liver wrapped in blackened cabbage, lobster in Sauteres, 
veal chop with morels. Chef Byron Gemmell has a carefuly designed menu with 
nearly every item on it worthy of praise. Prepare to pay handsomely for the 
privlege of praising.

McCormick and Schmick, 2000 Main St., Irvine. (714) 756-0505. Open Mondays 
through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturdays, 5 to 11 p.m.; Sundays, 5 to 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick and Schmick is the latest member of an exclusive chain that started 
in the Pacific Northwest, a slick, muscular operation specializing in fresh 
seafoods and the food is terrific. Oysters like Quilicene, Olympia, Golden 
Mantle, and Skookum taste as if they have just been dragged from the sea. Fish 
like Copper River salmon in cream wiith bay scallops, or sea bass with Jamaican 
spices, are good enough to make a grown man weep. Non-fish eaters can feast on 
marinated chicken, or Cajun cheeseburgers. Head of the class.

DATE RAPE

By LORENZA MUNOZ, Lorenza Munoz is a recent graduate of Capistrano Valley High 
School and regular contributor to High Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a sunny, beautiful summer afternoon. Kerry, a freshman last year at 
Capistrano Valley High School, sat on the lawn and painfully told the story of 
her experience with date rape. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry (not her real name) was raped by a friend she was dating about a year and 
a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened in the Mission Viejo Mall parking lot," she said. "He had parked 
really far away in a dark spot. I didn't really think too much of it. I've 
always led a sheltered life and always learned to trust people. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to leave halfway through the movie and when we got in the car, he 
just transformed. I did nothing to lead him on in any way at all. There was no 
way to defend myself. I was pinned down. I've never felt so helpless in my 
whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Another girl, Tina (not her real name), 18, a recent graduate of Mission Viejo 
High, said she was twice the victim of date rape. The first happened about a 
year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at a party, then I decided to leave, alone, and this guy followed me 
out," she said. "He asked me if I was going to kiss him and I said no, but he 
did anyway. Then he grabbed me and threw me on the ground. He wouldn't let me 
up. . . . He molested me and raped me, then he finally let me go. I got to my 
car and ran away. 
</P>
<P>
"For so long, I denied it happened. I found out two weeks later that this guy 
was high on acid when he raped me. 
</P>
<P>
"The second time happened with this guy I was seeing. I had told him from the 
beginning that I didn't want to have sex with him, but then one night I got 
really drunk and passed out, and he took advantage of me. 
</P>
<P>
"I confronted him a week later. I was waiting to see if he would say something 
about it first, but he didn't. I yelled at him. I didn't feel mad at myself 
(unlike the first rape), I was angry at him." 
</P>
<P>
Rape is considered "any sexual assault that is committed against a woman's (or 
man's) will," said Judy Tucker, who works as hot-line volunteer for a crisis 
intervention service in Santa Ana. "The moment one person says no and the other 
person does it anyway, it is considered rape." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, more than 75,000 rapes are reported to the FBI each year, 
more than half of which are "acquaintance rapes" -- meaning that the victim 
knew her assailant, often romantically. And law enforcement officials estimate 
that only one in 10 date rapes goes on record, because victims harbor 
irrational feelings of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
This was the initial reaction of Kerry and Tina. Both girls believed they had 
somehow provoked the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was my fault for so long. I felt dirty, like scum . . . just awful," 
Kerry said. "I blamed it all on myself. After it happens, that's all you think. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt bad about something, but I didn't know why or what. A couple of 
months later, I figured out why," said Tina, explaining how she had mentally 
blocked out the rape. "I just started thinking about it and I saw it as it 
really was. Before, I felt like I let it happen somehow. Now I realize I had no 
control over it." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker explained that date-rape victims "feel that they've done something to 
deserve it. They think, 'Well, maybe if I wasn't wearing what I was wearing he 
wouldn't have raped me or maybe it was something I said.' . . . That comes from 
not understanding what rape is and that we, as women, have a right to say no. 
It is our body." 
</P>
<P>
Kerry and Tina have not told their parents about the rape. They are afraid 
their parents won't understand, perhaps deny it or blame their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"I would feel bad (telling my parents) because they would ask me why I didn't 
tell them before," Tina said. "Or they would say something like, 'Why didn't 
you scream or call out for help?' I've never really talked about it before. I 
never told anyone because it sounded so serious. It was hard to talk about it. 
. . . I always tried to forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
Kerry believes her parents "are real understanding, but I can't shatter their 
image that they have of their daughter. I was afraid of what people would 
think. One of my biggest fears was not being believed." 
</P>
<P>
They have, nonetheless, confided in a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker advises rape victims to talk about it with someone they trust. "It is 
very healing, if you're raped, to talk to someone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Ernsdorf, the resident psychologist at Capistrano Valley High, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of help in telling a significant other," he said. "A support 
system makes you feel less isolated." 
</P>
<P>
The psychological effects of date rape can be tremendous. Kerry was so 
traumatized that she contemplated killing herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to stay in bed," she said. "I considered suicide because I 
thought, 'You are so low. I can't believe you let that happen to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
She also went through a period of time when she pretended to be sick, so her 
parents let her stay home from school. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that if I went to school and saw my friends, they'd know. . . . They'd 
be able to see through me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tina's grades began to drop after the attack. "(Rape) does have serious 
psychological effects," she said. "My grades did go down and I was only 
concerned with going out and partying. My self-esteem was really low and I got 
in a lot of fights with my parents." 
</P>
<P>
Often the victim will isolate herself and distrust anyone around her, 
especially the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry has not dated since the attack and does not plan to do so for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take a chance -- not now. All guys have a side to them that 
they don't show to other people. Now I put up a wall. I don't like thinking 
that someone I love and care for, like my own brother, for example, could 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Tina still goes out on dates but is more wary of the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really get scared, but I'm more cautious. I know that something could 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker says the trauma of date rape is, at times, harder to deal with than a 
rape committed by a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
"(Rape) is the last thought on your mind (when out on a date) and that's why 
it's such a shock," she said. "The girl trusted him (her date). Sometimes, date 
rape is much more difficult to get over." 
</P>
<P>
What motivates someone to commit such an attack? According to Ernsdorf, there 
are many psychological factors involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys feel that they're supposed to be aggressive, that girls like 
aggressive men," he said. "Other guys believe that when a girl says no, she 
really doesn't mean it. Basically, because they think women really like it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people genuinely have a hatred for women. They need to feel powerful and 
feel they are superior." 
</P>
<P>
The men who commit these crimes, however, do not consider the emotional scars 
they inflict upon their victims. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Tina felt hatred toward her attacker. Now, though, her hostility has 
subsided. "Now I have no respect for him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry, on the other hand, is still resentful and bitter. "I have so much anger 
about it," she said. "I want to kill him, but I could never do that. I can't 
help but hate the world. People are so cruel and they get no punishment 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Victims of date rape rarely report their attacks; thus, the rapist is seldom 
apprehended, much less convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage the girls to get medical attention and to report the rape," 
Tucker said. "If a girl goes into the hospital claiming that she was raped, the 
nurse is obligated by law to call the police. The district attorney is then 
called and will look at the evidence. If he feels there is not enough evidence 
to support the case, he will not take" the case. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. Alan Kadell of the Santa Ana Police Department said rape cases, especially 
date rapes, do not easily hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that it is one person's word against another's. Those kinds of 
cases are very difficult to prove, but each case that is reported is 
investigated." 
</P>
<P>
There are certain precautions that can be taken to avoid rape. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are drinking heavily, avoid one-on-one situations such as going out in 
the car alone," Ernsdorf suggests. "Also, do not date guys that you don't know 
very well or that have reputations. Learn how to say no in a firm, affirmative 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"Younger girls should avoid dating guys that are a lot older or stronger. And 
know your partner. If you're not sure, go out on double dates or to places that 
are safe." 
</P>
<P>
Tina and Kerry allowed themselves to be interviewed in the hope that by sharing 
their experiences they may be able to help others who have been raped. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't blame it on yourself," Tina said, "and talk about it so you don't feel 
guilty and you can understand what really happened." 
</P>
<P>
Kerry agreed that rape victims should not be made out to be the aggressors or 
ones who do the provoking. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the saddest things is that people look down on rape victims," she said. 
"They always think it's our fault. I don't know what I'd say, except not to 
blame yourself. . . . But I don't know what I wanted people to say to me." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of date rape is that it is committed by 
acquaintances, not total strangers, and a victim can never really sense it 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't predict it. That's what's so scary about it," Kerry said. "People 
know it exists, but I think they think it could never happen to them. I want to 
help people so much. It's an awful thing to go through and you don't know how 
it feels until it happens to you."

FIRST-BORNS LIKELY TO BE SPOILED BRATS, NEW STUDY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
First-borns have long enjoyed reputations as leaders, but a new study suggests 
they are also likely to grow up to be spoiled brats. 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. Joubert, a professor of psychology at the University of North 
Alabama who studied 29 first-borns, 33 middle-borns and 43 last-borns, found 
that first-borns scored higher on a narcissism test. The test measured such 
attributes as self-absorption, lack of empathy and a grandiose sense of 
self-importance. Sex was a factor too. First-born men scored higher than 
first-born women. 
</P>
<P>
Parental pampering may be to blame for first-borns' narcissism. "For a few 
years, they are often the little kings or queens of the house," Joubert says. 
"They could grow up with the idea that the world revolves around them." 
</P>
<P>
Although other researchers have suggested a link between being born first in 
the family and a lack of empathy, UCLA psychologist Frederick Frankel thinks 
calling first-borns narcissistic is taking it too far. "Narcissism implies a 
pathological condition," he says. First-borns may tend to be self-centered, he 
says, "but it doesn't necessarily mean you can't be sympathetic. Being 
self-centered is a quality, I think, necessary for leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, what is the best way to deal with a spouse or friend who displays 
narcissistic qualities? "Point out that others have needs and demands too," 
Joubert says. "In some cases, it might be a real revelation to them, and they 
won't take offense." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Frankel and Joubert are both first-borns. KATHLEEN DOHENY

SINGLE LIFE: CENTER 500 PUTS FOCUS ON THE ARTS AND FUN -- NOT JUST GETTING 
DATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It looked like a scene out of "The Great Gatsby." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, under a sky as hot as it was blue, an elegant crowd strolled 
lazily about a manicured lawn stretching on a bluff overlooking the aqua ocean. 
Like the fictitious inhabitants of West Egg, they wore crisp whites, sipped icy 
drinks, patted their foreheads while discussing the heat and challenged one 
another to games of croquet. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep expecting F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda to come gliding down the 
stairs," said Costa Mesa resident Eileen McDonnell, one of 300 guests who 
attended the "White Linen Jazz Picnic" at the Dana Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
The chic affair -- with jazz provided by saxophonist Eric Marienthal -- was 
presented by Center 500, a group that supports the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center. Although the 5-year-old organization -- still about 150 short of 
meeting its goal of 500 members -- is not a singles club, at least half its 
participants are unmarried. "We're 50-50-50-50: 50% married, 50% single, 50% 
male, 50% female," said Ken Sethney, vice president of communications for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, they pay their $250-a-year dues to further the arts. But singles cannot 
deny the social benefits of membership in Center 500. 
</P>
<P>
"I just moved here last April from San Diego, so my initial purpose for joining 
was to make new friends," said Deborah Erger, a Costa Mesa resident who sells 
medical equipment. "I like the fact that (Center 500) is not a singles group, 
even though that makes it a little harder to meet other singles -- you have to 
figure out who's married and who's not. But because there's a mix, you're not 
under pressure to make getting dates your main goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found that a great way to meet other members is to work on the 
committees. We generally go out to eat together in a group after committee 
meetings, which has helped me to get acquainted with restaurants in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Erger, 36, added that she has "outgrown the bar scene" as a social avenue. 
"Center 500 members are sophisticated and professional," she said. "It's nice 
to be around people who are in my age range." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hicks of Newport Beach agreed that Center 500's preponderance of yuppies 
could be an attraction to such "thirtysomething" lawyers as himself: "Most 
members are between the ages of 30 and 45; it's a mature bunch." 
</P>
<P>
While Hicks said he enlisted in the organization "primarily to make business 
contacts," he admitted: "I find myself enjoying it more for its social 
aspects." 
</P>
<P>
Center 500 has given John Coute an education in music appreciation as well an 
enhanced social life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a performing arts illiterate," said the 38-year-old Costa Mesa resident, 
an art director for an ad firm. "It used to be that the only live music I 
listened to was rock 'n' roll, in underground clubs in L.A. I thought opera was 
a just bunch of fat women wearing helmets. Since joining Center 500 a year ago, 
I've been to the opera a few times, and it blows me away." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Coute has not gotten around to asking out any fellow members. "Negative 
on that, but there are several possibilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Romance does occasionally blossom among members. Mark Matthess of San Clemente 
and Jo-Ann Caronna of Irvine met three months ago at a Center 500 mixer. Last 
Sunday, they mixed only with each other. The affectionate couple sat in a shady 
corner, apart from the party's hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
Matthess, 43, a real estate broker, did not waste much time in getting what he 
came for out of Center 500. "I joined four months ago to meet some nice people 
and because I liked the cause," he said. "And, well, here's the nice person I 
met." 
</P>
<P>
Caronna, 41, who owns a clothing boutique, offered this advice: "The key to 
meeting people in this organization is to become really active in it." 
</P>
<P>
Another happy Center 500 couple who first crossed paths at a mixer last summer 
are engaged to be married in October. "I saw her and I saw stars," Paul Schmidt 
said of his fiancee, Rossana Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, 41, a computer salesman in Newport Beach, said an appealing feature of 
the organization is that it "de-emphasizes the singles aspect." 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the group stands on its own," he said. "The parties are fun 
whether or not you have come to meet someone, and whether or not you do meet 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're interested only in meeting other singles," said Rodriguez, 31, a 
Newport Beach teacher, "you might be better off in another organization. In 
most singles clubs, people are strictly focused on making dates. Center 500 is 
more well rounded."

ORANGE COUNTY FACES AN INCREASING DRAIN ON ITS SUPPLIES 
</P>

<P>
What's the future of Orange County's water supply? 
</P>
<P>
Rationing is one possibility. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente has already declared a first-stage drought alert, urging residents 
and businesses to make water-conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Overall the county faces the same potential shortage as the rest of Southern 
California, said Tim Skrove, spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District. 
"We're really living year to year now in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The MWD imports water for the county from Northern California and the Colorado 
River. Should shortages become acute, cities will have first priority from the 
state water project. Agricultural users could be forced to take cuts up to 50%. 
The worst-case scenario would result in cutbacks on industrial water supplies, 
which would profoundly affect the economy, Skrove said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been living on borrowed time since 1985 when Arizona started taking some 
Colorado River water," he said of the result of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling 
reapportioning the two states' share. 
</P>
<P>
By 1992 the area could be receiving as little as 55% of its current Colorado 
River supply. The loss cannot be made up from Northern California because of 
inefficiencies in the state's water project's 400-mile transportation system, 
Skrove said. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning Southern California population and three consecutive dry years 
further strain the situation. MARK LANDSBAUM

'SUPERLOOPERS' HAVE THE RIGHT BACKGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN FARLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two producers putting the finishing touches on the pilot for Steven 
Bochco's new ABC series, "Doogie Howser, M.D." -- about a 16-year-old genius 
who is a pediatrician -- were, of course, anxious that it be just right. 
</P>
<P>
TV is a business of hitting your marks and closely following the script. But 
the actors assembled to dub in background dialogue -- called "looping" -- 
before "Doogie Howser's" producers in a sound room at 20th Century Fox could 
make up their lines as they went along. That's what they were hired to do. 
</P>
<P>
They're the SuperLoopers, a group of improvisational actors not seen on camera, 
but who have been regulars, nonetheless, on TV shows ranging from "The Wonder 
Years" to "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to regular "looping," the SuperLoopers work without scripts. In 
their own invisible, unsung way, they have helped give television a more 
realistic edge. 
</P>
<P>
How they work was probably shown best in "Hill Street Blues" with its then 
startlingly new sound of overlapping dialogue and the cacophony of voices in 
the Hill Street precinct house. Aside from the dialogue of the principal 
actors, most of those voices belonged to the SuperLoopers. 
</P>
<P>
As the group's founder, Dee Marcus, recalled: "Steven (Bochco) wanted a new 
sound, really hot and exciting and so personal that people would think they 
were in the middle of a squad room." One of Bochco's associates on the show, 
Gregory Hoblit, knew Marcus as a writer, actress and improvisational acting 
teacher. (She also founded the Off the Wall improv troupe, which is still 
performing after nearly 14 years. ) 
</P>
<P>
"Greg convinced Steven to let us do the 'Hill Street' pilot," Marcus said, "and 
we wound up working every episode of the show." Marcus and her group were shown 
a rough cut of each scene with its principal dialogue already laid in. On the 
spot, they improvised background conversation to fit the mood of the scenes and 
the actions of the extras moving through the precinct house. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always a different situation -- the squad room was under siege, or a 
new electrical system was being done or it was full of reporters," said David 
Anspaugh, a former "Hill Street" associate producer who went on to direct the 
films "Hoosiers" and "Fresh Horses." 
</P>
<P>
"You can never underestimate the contribution these people made to the success 
of the show," Anspaugh said. "It is a very specific skill and one that very few 
people can pick up on immediately and do. You have to see a scene only once, or 
maybe two or three times if you're lucky, and be able to think on your feet 
quickly and creatively, constantly ad-libbing and mimicking the scene's 
movement and action. So you've got about six balls in the air at once." 
</P>
<P>
Though the group had worked on features, miniseries and made-for-TV movies 
before "Hill Street," it was "Hill Street" that paved the way for their success 
on episodic television. 
</P>
<P>
The series won four Emmys for sound design, and "the SuperLoopers made an 
enormous contribution to that," said Anspaugh. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when "Hill Street" detectives moved cautiously through the hallway 
of a tenement, recalls SuperLooper Ed Cook, "to keep the tenement sounds and 
apartment sounds alive and the impression that there were people there, we 
developed a whole repertoire of TV shows and radio shows that we would do, 
depending on whether the scene was day or night. So we were the soap operas, 
the children's shows, the radio call-in shows that you'd hear when the 
detectives would be walking down a corridor to break down a door." 
</P>
<P>
In the "Doogie Howser" pilot, SuperLooper Gracie Moore employed the same 
technique, making herself sound like a cartoon show, and a child laughing at 
it, while Howser had a talk in the hospital children's ward with a dispirited 
young patient. "Here are these people having this really sad conversation," 
Moore said, "but life is still going on, and the background cartoon sounds and 
laughter are reminders of that." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who gives her age as "twentysomething," is the youngest member of the 
group, who range in age up to Marcus' "fifty-something." As Marcus put it, "I 
play between 48 and 100." 
</P>
<P>
There are 12 core members in the group, but Marcus sometimes hires others to 
fill in -- including children and, once, an actor fluent in Swahili -- 
depending on the nature of the job. According to the SuperLoopers, former Off 
the Wall member John Ritter inadvertently gave them their name at their first 
session, which was working on Ritter's movie "Hero at Large." The story is that 
Ritter remarked "You guys are super loopers." 
</P>
<P>
There are other similar groups around, and competition for jobs is brisk, as is 
the competition to join the SuperLoopers. "Every time we run an ad in the trade 
papers, (for every) six calls from producers we get 150 calls from people who 
want to loop," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Each looper earns the Screen Actors Guild minimum of $414 per person for a 
day's work, whether that amounts to a single line or a full eight hours. In 
flush times, the "SuperLoopers" have had as many as six or seven jobs a week. 
Like other actors, they also earn residuals. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely pays the rent and keeps you going so you can be pursuing other 
things," said Andy Goldberg, an original member of SuperLoopers and Off the 
Wall. The improv background is helpful in SuperLooping because "you need to do 
different voices as the day is going on," he said, "so you can just click into 
a character that you think is appropriate for whatever is taking place on 
screen." 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked for, I think, everybody who worked on 'Hill Street' and has gone 
on and done other things," said Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-director Hoblit used them for his recent made-for-TV film "Roe vs. 
Wade." Anspaugh used them for "Fresh Horses," and the SuperLoopers have been 
called in for all of Bochco's series. They recently worked on "Orleans," a 
pilot starring Alfre Woodard and produced by Bochco's former "L.A. Law" 
partner, Terry Louise Fisher. And they will be heard on the upcoming films 
"Blue Steel" and "Nightmare on Elm Street V." 
</P>
<P>
To be helpful, and hence, used regularly, the SuperLoopers have to know when to 
turn up the volume on their performing skills, and when to keep it low. It's a 
fine line. 
</P>
<P>
"Every show is different," Goldberg said. "On 'L.A. Law,' we know we can't say 
anything that pops through the main dialogue, but on 'Hill Street,' they would 
look for those kinds of lines and they loved them." 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to SuperLoopers and groups like them are a number of sound 
libraries where producers can purchase sounds called "walla," a term dating 
back to the theater where background stage performers meant to sound like a 
murmuring crowd were instructed to say "walla, walla, walla." 
</P>
<P>
"The libraries are pretty complete," said Anspaugh. "You can get courtroom 
walla, crowd-on-a-street walla, restaurant walla, but it's very lifeless and 
pretty dull, really, and unrealistic."

TWO KIROV PRINCIPALS TO CANCEL ORANGE COUNTY DATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Altynai Assylmuratova and Konstantin Zaklinsky will not perform as scheduled 
with the Kirov Ballet during the company's nine-day engagement at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, which starts today. 
</P>
<P>
The principal dancers, who are married, returned to the Soviet Union on 
Wednesday to be with Assylmuratova's mother, who is gravely ill with cancer, 
according to Igor Stupnikov, a company spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
Assylmuratova was to have danced the role of Medora and Zaklinsky was to have 
danced Lankedem in "Le Corsaire" Aug. 22 and 24. Zaklinsky also was to have 
danced Prince Desire in "The Sleeping Beauty" Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
New casting has not been announced. The programs will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
Assylmuratova's mother has been ailing for weeks but her condition has 
deteriorated, according to Jane P. Hermann, presentations director of the 
Metropolitan Opera, which is presenting the Kirov's national tour. 
Assylmuratova and Zaklinsky flew to the Soviet Union from San Francisco, where 
they were appearing with the company. CHRIS PASLES

MOVABLE FEASTS: SCHMOOZING OVER CHEESE AND PASTA'S BOUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L. N. HALLIBURTON

<TEXT>
<P>
There I was, sampling a pretty snappy pasta pomodoro at Cheese and Pasta in 
Santa Monica when all of a sudden I felt as if I were standing in a shop in 
Antwerp, circa 1943. Owner Jim Deely, a former cook in the diplomatic corps, 
was telling a customer about his precious deliveries from the La Brea Bakery. 
"The breads are very tough to get," he was saying. "You have to have a 
relationship, if you know what I mean." I almost looked in my billfold for a 
fougasse ration card. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you arrive too late to claim one of those elusive loaves, which are 
available Wednesday through Saturday, there's no real sense of scarcity here. 
Bounty abounds in the big case of cheeses, the fridge filled with fresh pastas 
and the great bowls and platters of cooked food. And there's no problem with 
shipments -- everything but the bread is prepared on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Even without bread on which to spread it, Cheese and Pasta's dense, rich, 
smooth chicken liver pate laced with sour cream is worth seeking out. And minus 
sandwich possibilities, the dill cucumber salad is still delicious. 
</P>
<P>
Cheese and Pasta serves many of the '80s standards one finds in -- how else to 
say it? -- yuppie take-out shops. The rather dull-looking curried chicken salad 
is not as gorgeous as what you find in other shops but actually turns out to 
taste lush and wonderful. Jamaican chicken, moist breasts rubbed with a paste 
of ginger, garlic and pepper, is also excellent. 
</P>
<P>
But while the lemon linguine seafood pasta looks inviting -- strewn as it is 
with cherry tomatoes, tricolored peppers, and clam shells lining the bowl -- it 
tastes oily and is filled with those itsy-bitsy shrimp that are better off left 
in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Taking home some of Cheese and Pasta's fresh black squid-ink linguine to see if 
it had a flavor of the deep, I found it contained a definite, if subtle, squid 
taste -- the gustatory equivalent of putting a seashell to the ear. 
</P>
<P>
On the terrestrial front, Cheese and Pasta offers 17 different three-course 
picnics to go. They range in price, per person, from $8.95 for a slice of 
tomato basil quiche, salad and dessert to poached salmon, potato salad, green 
beans with pesto and dessert at $16.95. Still, I'd rather go the a la carte 
route. 
</P>
<P>
Picnic portions are small and, at least in the meals I tasted, not nearly as 
good as food I chose in the shop. The consistency of the custard in the tomato 
basil quiche, for instance, tasted like a weak moussaka, and the crust was like 
leather left out in the rain. The crunchy green beans were covered with a mere 
thimbleful of pesto. 
</P>
<P>
And once, when I ordered the calamari salad supper, someone substituted an 
extra apricot chicken by mistake. The chicken, by the way, arrived with a 
pallid apricot sauce, not "spicy" as the menu had described. And the 
accompanying Indonesian rice was not to be found; an ordinary broccoli salad 
was tucked in instead. For dessert, fudge brownies were moist and satisfying, 
the creme caramel grainy. 
</P>
<P>
You're welcome to taste before you buy -- and affable owner Deely likes to 
schmooze about food. "You know why I dreamed up the Babcock peaches stuffed 
with mascarpone?" he asked. "Someone needed finger food for a funeral." 
</P>
<P>
While I wouldn't say everything's to die for, I would consider getting on a 
ration line for that curried chicken salad or that chicken liver pate. With or 
without the La Brea Bakery bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheese and Pasta, 1415 Montana Ave., Santa Monica. (213) 451-1753 or (213) 
394-2131. Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m.-7 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m.-5:30 p.m.

'CASUALTY' NEWCOMER WALKS ON AS A STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hi. I've never acted before." 
</P>
<P>
Those were the first words 22-year-old Thuy Thu Le says she blurted to director 
Brian DePalma at a casting call last year for the film "Casualties of War." Le 
learned of the tryout -- for a beautiful Vietnamese girl -- from a "little tiny 
ad" posted in front of a Chinatown restaurant in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought of acting, even when I answered the call," she said. "I just 
wanted to meet Brian DePalma. 'The Untouchables' is one of my favorite movies." 
</P>
<P>
So when DePalma singled her out for a part in his new film, which opens today, 
Le figured she had been chosen to play an extra. 
</P>
<P>
"The casting director called and said, 'You've got the role. You're leaving for 
Thailand in four days,' " Le said. "Two days before I left, an agent gave me 
the script. I looked at it and said, 'Wait a minute, my name appears a lot in 
here. Is that me?' She said, 'Yeah, you have the leading female role.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Oh, OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
In "Casualties of War," Le plays a South Vietnamese village girl who is 
abducted, brutally raped and eventually murdered by a squad of American 
soldiers on a long-range reconnaissance mission. The troop's ranks include 
ringleader Sean Penn and the dissenting Michael J. Fox. In the dense jungle, Le 
becomes what Penn calls their "portable R&amp;R." 
</P>
<P>
The first-time actress, with no prior experience or training, said that she 
went over the script carefully with her mother before agreeing to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"There were certain things I did not want to do," Le said on a recent Los 
Angeles visit from her home in Paris. She paused, then dropped her eyes and 
continued. "I can't take my clothes off in front of the camera. Asian people 
are reserved. They're very reserved. Even after playing this role, I'm sure I 
will get criticism from the Asian community -- 'How could she play that rape 
victim? How could she let them throw her around?' " 
</P>
<P>
DePalma consented to Le's request, and a double was used for the rape scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to be ashamed of. I'm proud of doing that movie. I'm playing a 
victim, and it shows the whole world how a rape victim feels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vietnam and reared in different parts of the United States, the petite 
Le is currently an English major at the University of Paris at Creteil. In 
addition to English, Le speaks Vietnamese and French. She plans to one day 
teach English to French students. 
</P>
<P>
With her bobbed hair and Western accent, Le is far removed from the bruised and 
bloodied peasant girl she portrays in the film. "When I tried out for the role, 
I was asked to look scared and scream a lot, which is mostly what I do in the 
movie, anyway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the film, an elaborate Vietnamese village and U.S. Army base were 
constructed on location in Phuket, an island in the southern part of Thailand. 
Shooting for five months in the sweltering, tropical climate, there were times 
when Le wasn't sure if she was an actress or a peasant girl. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, I felt like her. I felt like this Vietnamese girl," Le said. "I 
was beaten, tied up and dragged along. Sometimes I thought, 'Why am I doing 
this? Maybe I'm the victim.' We worked 10 hours a day. I dressed like her and 
put on her wig. Every time I looked in the mirror, I didn't see myself. I saw 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Le is a real victim of war. In 1975, when she was 8 and living in Vietnam, her 
father rushed into the house one night and ordered her family to pack some 
things. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, 'Where are we going?' " Le recalled. "He said, 'I don't know, 
we're just leaving.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was during the fall of Saigon. Le's father led his family through city 
rubble, where bombs were falling and people were rioting in the streets. They 
boarded a ship and were soon on their way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
That experience came back to haunt Le during the filming of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes -- when I saw soldiers and we were in the village doing a scene -- I 
would think about that, about the last day. That's when it really hit me that 
there was a war in my country. I saw the villagers and the sets, and I thought, 
'I heard about that, but I never really knew how it was.' 
</P>
<P>
"It brought me back to my Vietnamese self. I was raised in America and was sort 
of forgetting that I'm Vietnamese." 
</P>
<P>
For most of her scenes, Le was the only female actress on the set. Her lines 
were all spoken in Vietnamese, so DePalma gave her freedom to ad lib. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a script. I would just go to the set concentrating, talking to 
myself in Vietnamese. After a while, I was able to block out all these 
English-speaking people and hear only Vietnamese. When I got to the set, I 
reacted to what was going on at that minute. I thought to myself, 'What would I 
do if they were really doing this to me?' " 
</P>
<P>
When speaking of "Casualties of War," Le often refers to the film's characters 
instead of the actors playing them. In some cases, she said it was not 
difficult to imagine that the scenes were actually happening. "I remember in 
the hooch, when they captured and kidnapped me. We did that scene three nights 
in a row -- Meserve (Sean Penn) throwing me around, and Clark (Don Harvey) 
pushing me down on the table. You know, there were a lot of real bruises," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Le's screen debut as a rape victim is convincing. DePalma was so impressed that 
he offered to help her find work. But she said that there are few roles for 
minorities and -- despite her strong performance -- acting is a "one-shot 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
"For the last two years, this is what I've been doing," said Le, who recently 
married a medical student in Paris. "It's been nice. But now I want to go back 
to the other life, become a normal person and finish my degree."

PUC JUDGE PROPOSES OVERHAUL OF RULES GOVERNING PHONE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move opposed by business and consumer groups, a California Public 
Utilities Commission administrative law judge Thursday recommended a major 
overhaul in the way the telephone industry is regulated in California. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, which are expected to be formally adopted with minor 
modifications in the fall, would link future telephone rate changes by Pacific 
Bell and General Telephone of California to the inflation rate and grant the 
companies greater cost-cutting incentives and pricing flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer and business groups representing telephone users criticized the 
general thrust of the decision by Administrative Law Judge Charlotte L. Ford, 
but declined to comment in detail before reviewing the 350-page judgement. "We 
don't think any of these changes are necessary," said Audrie Krause, executive 
director of the consumer advocacy group Toward Utility Rate Normalization 
(TURN). "These recommendations don't benefit residential customers." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, local telephone rates have fallen steadily, and 
groups representing telephone users say capping rates is thus of little benefit 
to consumers and could ultimately result in higher costs. "I want to make 
certain there are guarantees and safeguards in place," said State Senator 
Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Large businesses that are heavy users of telecommunications services also 
oppose changes in the current regime, and fear they will be forced -- through 
the rates charged for special business services -- to shoulder the costs of 
continued telephone network modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell Executive Vice President Gary McBee lauded the judge's 
"recognition of the need for change," and said that although the decision 
differed substantially from a plan Pacific Bell had proposed, it "seems like an 
acceptable way" to reach the company's goals. 
</P>
<P>
GTE, in a prepared statement, called the proposed ruling "a positive step 
towards streamlining the regulatory process and allowing telephone utilities to 
be more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision follows nearly two years of debate over how to reform the 
complicated process by which telephone rates are regulated in the state. It 
aims to establish so-called incentive regulation and limits all future 
telephone rate increases to the rate of inflation minus a 4% "productivity 
factor," eliminating the need for the telephone companies to justify all 
changes through rigorous rate cases. If inflation in 1990 is 5%, the maximum 
phone rate increase would be 1%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Expected 
</P>
<P>
In return, Pacific Bell and GTE would be able to earn up to a 12.75% rate of 
return on investment. Beyond that level, they could keep 50% of any profits, 
with the balance refunded to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the judge's decision is only a recommendation, Commission President G. 
Mitchell Wilk called it a "balanced proposal that goes in the right direction 
and benefits the infrastructure of the California economy." The full commission 
is expected to approve the proposal with minor modifications following the 
three-week comment period, and the new plan would go into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In California and elsewhere, telephone rates have traditionally been regulated 
on the basis of the telephone company's profits, or rate-of-return. Thus, 
Pacific Bell and GTE were allowed to charge whatever rates would allow them to 
earn a fixed return on investment, typically between 11% and 12%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Caps for AT&amp;T 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1984 breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and the 
introduction of competition for many telecommunications services, however, the 
telephone companies have maintained that such a system is inappropriate because 
it gives them no incentives to improve productivity and requires time-consuming 
regulatory approvals for all price changes and investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
At the national level, the Federal Communications Commission has already 
abandoned rate-of-return regulation of AT&amp;T's long-distance business in 
favor of so-called price caps, under which the company agrees to hold basic 
long-distance rates stable in return for flexibility on investment and pricing 
decisions.

GOLDMAN SACHS BROKER FACES FRAUD COUNT, BUT CHARGES AGAINST 2 OTHER TRADERS ARE 
DROPPED

<P>
A criminal insider trading investigation that shook Wall Street in 1987 with 
the highly publicized arrests of three senior traders ended Thursday with the 
announcement that one of the men will plead guilty to a single felony count. 
</P>
<P>
No charges will be filed against the other two. The U.S. Attorney's Office in 
Manhattan said that Robert M. Freeman, the former head of arbitrage at the 
investment firm Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., will plead guilty to a mail fraud 
count stemming from one incident of insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
But Acting U.S. Atty. Benito Romano said his office, after more than two years 
of investigation, had decided it won't file any charges against Richard B. 
Wigton, the former head of risk arbitrage and over-the-counter trading at 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., and Timothy L. Tabor, a former Kidder official who 
later worked at Merrill Lynch. The decision lays to rest the government's 
longstanding contention that there was a broad criminal conspiracy among the 
three to trade inside information on pending takeover deals. 
</P>
<P>
Romano admitted Thursday that the government had made a mistake by arresting 
the three in February, 1987, although he said he doesn't believe that 
prosecutors owe Wigton and Tabor an apology for the lengthy investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have been better advised not to have proceeded with an arrest at such 
an early stage of the investigation," Romano said. The arrests, in which the 
men were handcuffed and two were physically removed from their offices by 
federal agents, were extremely unusual in securities fraud cases. The arrests 
had been ordered by then-U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, now a candidate for 
mayor of New York. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrests, Tabor lost his job at Merrill Lynch and Wigton was forced to 
take a leave of absence from Kidder. A Kidder spokeswoman said Thursday that 
the firm is holding talks with Wigton, who is 59, about returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to file civil insider 
trading charges against Freeman. Sources on Thursday said that despite 
prosecutors' decision not to bring criminal charges against Tabor and Wigton, 
the SEC may still bring civil charges against them and against Goldman Sachs. 
An SEC official declined to comment Thursday. Lawrence Pedowitz, a lawyer for 
Goldman Sachs, said he had "absolutely no idea" if the SEC will bring charges 
against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Freeman, 47, confirmed that he will plead guilty to a single felony 
count relating to the use of inside information in trading Beatrice Cos. 
options in 1986. He also resigned from Goldman Sachs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In his plea agreement, Freeman did not agree to cooperate with prosecutors in 
any continuing investigations. He appeared briefly Thursday in U.S. District 
Court in Manhattan to waive his right to a grand jury indictment. He is 
expected to formally plead guilty on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deal Hit a Snag 
</P>
<P>
In a document filed with the court, Freeman admitted that he had received 
inside information on a single occasion from Martin Siegel, the former Kidder 
investment banker who represented Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in its 
leveraged buyout of Beatrice. Siegel later pleaded guilty to securities fraud 
and tax evasion charges and gave prosecutors information that led to the 
investigation of Freeman, Tabor and Wigton. 
</P>
<P>
In the court document, Freeman said that in early January, even before his 
conversation with Siegel, he had begun selling his personal stake in Beatrice 
and reducing Goldman Sach's position because of suspicion that something had 
gone wrong with the Beatrice deal. But Freeman then talked by phone with 
Bernard Lasker, a broker whose nickname is "Bunny." Lasker passed along a rumor 
that the Beatrice transaction had in fact hit a snag. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said he received illegal inside information from Siegel in the form of 
a brief remark confirming the accuracy of the rumor. Freeman said Siegel told 
him "Your bunny has a good nose." Based on that remark, Freeman ordered the 
sale of additional Beatrice options. 
</P>
<P>
The snag turned out to be a change in the structure of the deal, in which 
holders of Beatrice stock would be given less cash than originally envisioned. 
When the restructuring was disclosed publicly, the price of Beatrice stock fell 
by more than $4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty plea marked an abrupt reversal by Freeman. For more than two years, 
he strongly maintained that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. In public 
statements, Goldman Sachs also had vigorously defended Freeman and kept him on 
its staff. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case said Freeman's decision to plead guilty was 
influenced by the guilty verdict last month in the Princeton/Newport Limited 
Partners racketeering and securities fraud trial. James Sutton Regan, the 
firm's managing general partner and a close friend of Freeman's, was convicted 
on all counts along with five other defendants. One source said the verdict 
"discouraged Freeman." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subjected to 'Innuendoes' 
</P>
<P>
But in his resignation letter, Freeman strongly denied that he was involved in 
any broad-ranging conspiracy. Freeman's lawyers and Goldman Sachs, in separate 
statements, noted that the single charge filed Thursday was far narrower than 
the broad insider trading conspiracy alleged in an indictment returned in 1987. 
Freeman's lawyers, Paul J. Curran and Robert B. Fiske Jr., both former U.S. 
attorneys in Manhattan, said in a written statement that "Mr. Freeman continues 
to deny categorically the conspiracy allegations upon which he was arrested and 
indicted in 1987." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs, in a letter to its employees, said: "We do not condone even a 
single act of wrongdoing." But the firm said Freeman was subjected to "a series 
of highly publicized formal allegations and innuendoes that far exceed anything 
he actually did." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to 
$1.86 million, representing twice the amount that the government claims Freeman 
received in financial benefit from the illegal trades. U.S. Magistrate Nina 
Gershon allowed him to remain free without imposing any bail. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment against Freeman, Tabor and Wigton was dropped after prosecutors 
acknowledged that they weren't prepared to go to trial. At the time, Giuliani 
had promised that a new indictment would be brought against all three "in 
record time." Prosecutors in 1987 stated in court that the original charges 
amounted only to "the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Arkin, Wigton's lawyer, praised the decision to drop the investigation 
of his client. "It's about time," he said. "The arrest and what happened to him 
was one of the most egregious events in recent history in terms of law 
enforcement." Without specifically naming Giuliani, Arkin said the person 
responsible for the arrest and indictment "owes him (Wigton) a devout apology." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lawler, Tabor's lawyer, was on vacation Thursday. But in a written 
statement, he said the arrest and indictment of Tabor had caused "incalculable 
personal and professional damage." Lawler said: "A thorough investigation would 
have established, and indeed has established, that Mr. Tabor is innocent of any 
wrongdoing." Lawler, however, praised Romano's decision to announce publicly 
that the investigation had been ended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment From Giuliani 
</P>
<P>
Tabor, 36, was said to be working as a computer software consultant. He didn't 
respond Thursday to a request for an interview. Wigton also couldn't be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani's campaign press spokesman failed to return three phone calls from a 
reporter seeking comment on Thursday. Giuliani had said previously, however, 
that the arrests may have been unduly hasty. 
</P>
<P>
Romano said he didn't believe that the investigation marked a setback for the 
government. Referring to Freeman's agreement to plead guilty, Romano said: "We 
have a substantial criminal charge lodged against a very significant member of 
the financial community." 
</P>
<P>
Jed Rakoff, Siegel's lawyer, said the end of the Freeman, Tabor and Wigton 
investigation clears the way for Siegel to be sentenced.

SPECULATING ON A SPORTS CAR; 
</P>
<P>
OUT-OF-STATE MIATA OWNERS SEE A CHANCE TO MAKE BIG PROFITS ON A SMALL AUTO 
THAT'S IN SHORT SUPPLY HERE.

<P>
Furniture store owner Ron Behrens of Spencer, Iowa, figures that he can make a 
quick $10,000 profit by selling his new Mazda Miata sports convertible -- in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure the market for the car might be better out there with all the people 
and the sunny climate," Behrens, 41, said Thursday in a telephone interview. 
"By October, it's time to put the car away for the winter out here." He is 
asking $25,000 for his 2-week-old Miata roadster in a Times classified ad. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of Mazda's hot new roadster are trying to cash in on the car's 
popularity by trying to resell their cars at top dollar, at least in Los 
Angeles. Miata owners -- some asking $40,000 for a car that lists between 
$13,800 and $18,000 -- placed 40 classified ads in Thursday's Times. 
</P>
<P>
The Miata's unusual design, relatively low price and rave reviews in auto trade 
magazines have fired the enthusiasm of many car buyers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you stop, people ask, 'How do you like it?' " said Upland resident 
Dan Galindo, 41, of the white Miata he is trying to sell for $40,000. "But 
there are some bills I've got to pay and someone suggested to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
But so far, he added, there have not been many calls. One man offered only 
$24,000, and a couple promised to come over to take a look. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those selling Miatas through classified ads are from outside 
California. News reports of long waiting lists at Southern California auto 
dealerships -- and the region's well-known car culture -- assure them of a 
better price than they would receive at home, the sellers say. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles has got a lot more money than middle Tennessee," said a physician 
in Winchester, Tenn., who placed a classified ad asking $50,000 for a pair of 
red and white Miatas. "It's a California car -- not a middle Tennessee car," he 
added, declining to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that there are 200-person waiting lists for the car at a lot of the 
local dealerships out there," said Craig Wipperman, 27, an engineer in 
Huntsville, Ala., who was trying to sell his week-old Miata for $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great car to drive," Wipperman said. "But I paid $18,500 for it, and if 
somebody offers me $25,000 I think it will be stupid for me to turn them down." 
</P>
<P>
Even out-of-state car salespeople are getting into the act. Troy Cutrubus and 
Carl Burge, who sell Mazdas in Ogden, Utah, placed an ad in Los Angeles after 
Southern California Mazda dealers called them looking for Miatas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Mind Keeping' Car 
</P>
<P>
"They were willing to pay over sticker," Cutrubus said. "So we thought we might 
as well advertise out there if we have the clientele." 
</P>
<P>
But the out-of-state sellers may have overestimated Southern Californians' 
appetite for the sporty new car. None of the owners contacted, other than 
Galindo, had received even one offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a single call yet," said Leah Whiteside, a video store owner in 
Dallas who is asking $31,000 for a red Miata with an optional hard top and is 
awaiting the delivery of a second car she also intends to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"We may give them a price break if they come and get it," Whiteside said. But 
"it's a car you don't mind keeping if you don't sell it."

Famous Amos Moves Headquarters: Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookie Corp. has 
moved a "lean corporate staff" of fewer than 20 employees to San Francisco from 
Torrance, according to Keith R. Lively, chief operating officer. Famous Amos, a 
pioneer in the premium cookie business, will maintain a two-person regional 
office in Southern California and will continue to produce its cookies in the 
area on a contract basis. Last year, Famous Amos was bought by the Shansby 
Group, a San Francisco-based buyout fund. Lively said nearly all the corporate 
officers were from the San Francisco area and "wanted to return."

More Unions to Fight BAT Takeover: Labor leaders condemned the 
multibillion-dollar hostile takeover bid for Britain's BAT Industries PLC and 
its U.S. affiliates, pledging to enlist public opinion plus state and federal 
lawmakers in their fight. An investment group headed by Anglo-French financier 
Sir James Goldsmith, British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Austrian 
investor Kerry Packer made an offer for BAT in July that it valued at about 
$21.6 billion. "Such a takeover would jeopardize the livelihoods of 55,000 
American workers, including nearly 6,000 union members," said John DeConcini, 
international president of the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers 
International Union. The group has said it intends to sell the non-tobacco 
businesses of BAT, the world's largest tobacco company. BAT also has 
significant interests in financial services, retailing and the Farmers 
Insurance Group.

NATIONAL ENQUIRER STUDIES SPANISH EDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Enquirer is interested in dishing the dirt for a whole new 
audience: the Spanish-speaking population of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On the theory that inquiring minds want to know, no matter what language they 
speak, the new owners of the Lantana, Fla.-based supermarket tabloid are 
beginning to seriously study the possibility of publishing a paper to regale 
Spanish speakers with the same sort of scandal, disease and amazing diets that 
fill 4.3 million Enquirers each week. A sister publication, Weekly World News, 
has a weekly circulation of about 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Enquirer also is considering launching a soap opera publication and 
publishing the Enquirer internationally with a particular interest in Great 
Britain, where tabloid journalism is even more raucous than in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
But no decision has been made yet on any of these plans, said Michael Boylan, 
vice chairman of the National Enquirer and one of its new owners. "We've been 
pretty busy" simply operating the company since it changed hands in early June, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Stories 
</P>
<P>
A bidding contest for the Enquirer and Weekly World News ended in April when 
Macfadden Holdings and Boston Ventures Limited Partnership agreed to pay $412.5 
million to the estate of Generoso Pope Jr., who built the paper into a 
powerhouse of gossip. New York-based Macfadden publishes romance magazines, 
including True Confessions and Modern Romance. Boston Ventures is a Boston 
investment company that bought Motown Records last year in partnership with MCA 
Inc. for $61 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Spanish-language Enquirer would contain some stories tailored to a Latino 
audience, but "a good percentage (would be) what already is in the English 
edition," Boylan said. This week's edition, for example, includes such 
headlines as: 
</P>
<P>
* JACKIE O-NO! She's Red-Faced Over Semi-Nude Photo 
</P>
<P>
* Just-Married Reba McEntire's Secret -- She's Pregnant 
</P>
<P>
* I Came Back From Vacation and Found Out I Was Dead 
</P>
<P>
The company has conducted market research on the Spanish-language edition but 
won't seriously pursue the idea until after Labor Day, Boylan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably initially we would concentrate on easily defined Spanish-speaking 
pockets of the country," he said. "I would be disappointed if we would decide 
to go ahead with it -- and that decision hasn't been made -- and it wasn't out 
by the end of the year or the beginning of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spanish Gossip Market 
</P>
<P>
No name has been selected yet, he said. A Spanish edition and the possible soap 
opera publication would be distributed by the company's existing distribution 
subsidiary, DSI Inc., Boylan said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no serious national competition for the Spanish gossip market, Boylan 
said, although some regional publications exist. 
</P>
<P>
Successful sensationalistic publications in Spanish have in the past either 
originated in Mexico or have gotten most of their news from Mexico, said Rafael 
Prieto, a Spanish-language media consultant and former newspaper editor. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing quite like the Enquirer exists in Spanish, said Prieto, although there 
are magazines about television and soap operas, called novelas. 
</P>
<P>
"Yellow journalism in Spanish is different," said Prieto, now a free-lance 
writer. "It focuses more on crime and accidents and disease and people with 
their stomachs hanging out -- not stars."

Keye/Donna Wins Bridgestone Account: Los Angeles ad agency 
Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, which recently resigned the Suzuki automotive business, 
has picked up the estimated $10-million Bridgestone Tire account. Ads for the 
Japanese-owned tire maker, which were formerly created by the firm Lintas: 
Campbell Ewald, will now be created by Keye/Donna's year-old New York office; 
this single piece of business more than doubles the annual billings at that

PROBE OF DEFENSE CONTRACTORS REVEALED; 
</P>
<P>
SOME SUPPLIERS ACCUSED OF TRAFFICKING SECRET DOCUMENTS

Federal officials say the indictment of a former Boeing Co. official is part of 
a broader investigation into how defense contractors allegedly obtained secret 
Pentagon documents showing which weapons may be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
The probe is separate from the ongoing "Ill Wind" investigation of bribery and 
influence-peddling in the awarding of Defense Department contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The case became public Tuesday when Richard Lee Fowler, a former Boeing 
official, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., on 39 counts 
of theft, conspiracy and fraud arising from his alleged trafficking in 
classified documents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of a continuing investigation by the Department of Defense inspector 
general's office into how certain contractors and their employees have 
illegally trafficked in classified documents," a Pentagon official said 
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"How Fowler obtained these documents is the subject of further investigation," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-page indictment alleges that Fowler, while he worked for Boeing in 
Washington as a senior marketing analyst from 1978 to 1986, obtained hundreds 
of the Pentagon's most sensitive documents. 
</P>
<P>
Those papers included Air Force and Navy directives, along with the Pentagon's 
five-year budget plan, the main defense spending blueprint used by the 
secretary of defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and civilian service leaders, the 
indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the indictment alleges, Fowler obtained three National Security 
Council decision directives signed by former President Reagan. Those documents 
are normally closely held. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired by Boeing 
</P>
<P>
The three documents all dealt with the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed 
shield against nuclear attack, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fowler had a security clearance, he did not have authority to have 
access to those papers, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, contacted at home, said, "I do not wish to comment whatsoever on any of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler was fired by Boeing in September, 1986, said Harold Carr, a spokesman 
for the company in Seattle. The Wall Street Journal reported that the firing 
was because investigators began looking at Fowler's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing is cooperating with the investigators, Carr said. "There has been a 
considerable number of requests for documents, papers, records and so on," he 
said. "We have provided those and will continue to answer requests for them." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that after obtaining the papers, Fowler passed them 
along to Boeing officials and other, unnamed contractors. It also charged that 
he obtained some documents which had been specifically requested by Boeing 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, according to the indictment, Fowler removed the "secret" 
classification from some of the papers before passing them on to other Boeing 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
None of the other people under investigation are identified, although the 
indictment said some of the other alleged conspirators created separate log 
books to keep Pentagon officials from knowing that Boeing had the unauthorized 
classified documents. Boeing has authority to handle certain classified 
documents because it is a major defense contractor.

UAL STALLS DECISION ON DAVIS TAKEOVER BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UAL Corp. on Thursday stalled a decision on Los Angeles billionaire Marvin 
Davis' $6.2-billion takeover offer, saying it was "still premature" to decide 
whether selling itself was appropriate and that it would continue to study 
other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The company, parent of United Airlines, also confirmed that it has been 
contacted by various third parties regarding possible bids. In addition, it 
said its advisers met with representatives of an employee group. That group is 
known to be the airline's pilots. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's announcement, which came following a nearly all-day board meeting, fueled 
speculation that UAL will seek to pursue a management buyout or 
recapitalization to block Davis' sweetened $275-per-share offer made Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But UAL's announcement came as pressures mounted on the carrier to put itself 
up for auction. UAL stock has risen about $100 per share since Davis made his 
initial $240-per-share offer on Aug. 7, making defensive moves more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after the UAL announcement, Davis continued to hold out 
hope that a friendly transaction could be pursued.

EX-FEDERATED OFFICIALS WIN AGAINST ATARI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atari Corp. was ordered Thursday to pay severance and benefits totaling about 
$600,000 to two former top officials at Federated Group who were fired shortly 
after the retail chain was bought out by the computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
Atari officials had tried to persuade an Orange County Superior Court judge 
that the two officials had effectively forfeited the money through questionable 
business decisions at the time of the Federated acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Jack K. Mandel did not agree. Ruling only minutes 
after the four-day trial ended, he awarded former Federated President Keith 
Powell of Laguna Hills $260,000 in severance pay and former Vice President 
Merrill Lyons of Encino $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we've been exonerated," said Powell, who now heads a door and 
window company in San Juan Capistrano. "I'm just glad I had my day in court. 
All the facts are finally in, and clearly we didn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Both Powell and Lyons are also to receive interest on the severance payments as 
well as the resumption of their life insurance policies, bringing the total 
value of the verdict to about $600,000, their lawyer said. The judge denied 
punitive damages against Atari. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Aware of Decisions 
</P>
<P>
The case is one of the first in a series of legal disputes arising from Atari's 
1987 buyout of Federated for $67 million, a deal that Atari has since soured on 
in the face of continued losses by Federated. The retail outlet is now up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
In the broadest of these legal claims, still pending in federal court in 
Northern California, Atari maintains that it was duped into buying an 
overvalued company by Federated officials. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar line of argument in the Orange County case, Atari Chairman Jack 
Tramiel and other Atari officials testified that they were never made aware of 
and probably would never have agreed to several business decisions made by 
Powell and Lyon at Federated before they were fired. 
</P>
<P>
These decisions included the transfer of an $800,000 condominium to Federated 
commercial spokesman Shadoe Stevens at favorable terms, and a $1-million 
payment to the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. for its role in the 
Atari acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Mandel, in an interview after the ruling, said Powell and Lyon "acted 
reasonably" in their business decisions and that Atari wrongly refused to honor 
the legitimate severance agreements. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, in denying punitive damages against Atari, Mandel said 
that company officials may have had a reasonable basis to question those 
business decisions and that they did not act in bad faith in refusing to pay 
severance.

CINEPLEX WARNS OF $39-MILLION LOAN DEFAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon Corp., the Canadian movie theater chain that has been placed on 
the auction block by its two largest shareholder groups, said it could find 
itself in default on a $39-million bank loan and face accelerated payment of 
all of its long-term debt if its two top officers cease to be actively involved 
in the company's management. 
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, the company's long-term debt still exceeded $552 million, 
despite the recent sale of some major assets. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure, made in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, is provocative because Cineplex's controversial chairman and chief 
executive, Garth H. Drabinsky, and his vice-chairman, Myron Gottlieb, have a 
"golden handshake" deal that could be triggered as early as Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Drabinsky and Gottlieb have been trying to raise money to make a bid for the 
Toronto-based company, but no offer has yet materialized. Other potential 
buyers are scrutinizing the company, and some have indicated interest in 
bidding for certain assets, which include more than 1,200 movie screens in the 
United States and more than 500 in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Struggle 
</P>
<P>
Although Drabinsky helped found Cineplex 10 years ago and has always been its 
driving force, he never held a controlling stake. Four months ago, the Cineplex 
chairman tried to seize control by cutting a deal to buy the Cineplex holdings 
of Canada's wealthy Charles R. Bronfman clan. But the company's largest 
shareholder, entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc., objected vehemently and put 
down the attempted coup. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Bronfmans and MCA -- which together own about 65% of Cineplex's 
equity -- have banded together to put the company up for sale and have paved 
the way to fire Drabinsky and Gottlieb if they so choose. 
</P>
<P>
The two Cineplex executives have accepted new employment contracts of 
"indefinite" duration that can be terminated by either the individual or the 
company on 15 days' notice after Sept. 30. In a so-called golden handshake, the 
company has agreed to pay each man $8 million in Canadian currency, or $6.77 
million apiece in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Bronfmans and MCA have also forced Drabinsky to share the office of the 
chairman with two of their representatives and have changed some financial 
reporting practices. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the company released its financial results for the second 
quarter, reporting a $39-million loss on revenue of $149 million (U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex stock closed Thursday at $11.875 a share, down 62.5 cents, on a volume 
of 303,600 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

CAL STATE REHIRES PROFESSOR FIRED FOR EXPOSING HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California higher-education officials have reinstated a Cal State Northridge 
geography professor who was fired after he admitted exposing himself to two 
female instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Prof. Darrick Danta will resume teaching when classes begin in 
September, said Jeff Stetson, a spokesman for the chancellor's office of the 
Cal State University system. 
</P>
<P>
Danta, 34, was fired by CSUN President James W. Cleary in November after the 
professor admitted that he exposed himself to instructors Carolyn 
McGovern-Bowen and Christine Rodrigue. His ouster prompted support from some 
faculty members who alleged that Cleary did not follow proper university 
procedures in the firing. 
</P>
<P>
Danta said today his behavior toward the two women was "a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Danta appealed his case and was reinstated July 31 after an arbitration hearing 
between CSU counsel and the California Faculty Assn., the teachers' union 
representing him, Stetson said. University officials refused to comment further 
on the case, saying it is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this summer that a CSUN professor has been reinstated 
after being fired by campus officials. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the State Personnel Board ordered CSUN to reinstate Eleazu S. 
Obinna, a Pan-African studies professor who was fired last summer for allegedly 
offering students "A" grades in exchange for selling raffle tickets to raise 
money for his nonprofit foundation. The state board also ordered Obinna 
suspended for 90 days.

SIMI POLICE SEIZE 2,068 POUNDS OF COCAINE IN RAID INTO L.A. COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
Simi Valley police this morning announced the largest seizure of cocaine ever 
by Ventura County law enforcement officers -- 2,068 pounds with an estimated 
street value of $94 million. 
</P>
<P>
The drug seizure and the arrests of five Colombian nationals were made in 
neighboring Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Chief Paul Miller said a four-day investigation took 
narcotics detectives from Simi Valley to areas of Newhall and Chatsworth before 
the big bust was made Thursday. At 2:30 p.m. officers stopped at car under 
surveillance on the Golden State Freeway in Newhall and found 277 pounds of the 
drug inside, Miller said. Police arrested the driver, Angelo Alviro, 41, whose 
address is unknown, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, investigators served search warrants at houses in Chatsworth and 
Newhall. At a house in the 9600 block of Gierson Avenue in Chatsworth, 
investigators found 1,791 pounds of cocaine in a van parked in the garage and 
arrested Roceo Campo, 26, Miller said. At a house in the Wintergreen Court in 
Newhall, no drugs were found, but three people were arrested. They were 
identified as Efraim Belalclzar, 38, and Derly De La Cruz, 27, both of whom 
live in the house, and Francisco Altoreilo, 28, who lives in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
All five were being held on suspicion of possessing a controlled substance.

KARATE PRO, ESCAPE ARTIST GETS 17 YEARS FOR MOLESTING 5 BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Allen Hydrick, a professed karate expert and escape artist who allegedly 
molested five Huntington Beach boys, today was sentenced to 17 years in state 
prison after pleading guilty to 11 felony child molestation counts. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick, who once toured the nation in martial arts exhibitions under the name 
Sir James, was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Luis Cardenas under a 
plea-bargaining agreement worked out with Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Koski. 
</P>
<P>
Koski said the 30-year-old Hydrick would be eligible for parole in 8 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Hydrick, who claims to have escaped from half a dozen jails in 
Georgia, South Carolina and Utah, befriended the victims last summer in 
Huntington Beach, luring them back to his apartment and molesting them. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick had professed his innocence in telephone calls to reporters, saying the 
teen-agers had turned on him for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick was extradited from Georgia in January and has been held in the Orange 
County Jail because of past escape attempts.

COLOMBIA POLICE CHIEF SLAIN AFTER BATTLING DRUG CARTEL; 
</P>
<P>
HAD SENT GUARDS TO AID JUDGES

MEDELLIN, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The police chief of Colombia's Antioquia state, who took on the notorious 
Medellin drug cartel on its home territory, was shot to death today in a hail 
of machine-gun fire near his home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting came a day after judges shut down Colombia's courts indefinitely 
and 50 of Bogota's 55 appeals court judges resigned to demand more government 
protection from ruthless drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
The provincial police chief, Col. Waldemar Franklin Quintero, was killed and 
his driver wounded when gunmen intercepted their car and riddled it with 
automatic weapons fire, authorities and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack came after Franklin Quintero sent his own bodyguards to protect 
court judges whose lives had been threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Since assuming his post in January, the colonel had led an active campaign 
against drug traffickers and right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
Local reporters said he coordinated two helicopter-borne police raids aimed at 
dismantling two big Medellin cocaine cartel complexes, last January and two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Quintero had told reporters privately in recent months that he had 
received a stream of death threats. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, provincial Gov. Helena Herran de Montoya said, he gave up his 
bodyguard force because he "thought it was more important to use this personnel 
in protecting judges." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities blamed the killing on the Medellin cartel, the world's largest 
cocaine ring, which is believed responsible for about 80% of the cocaine 
smuggled into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel, who was hit more 
than 100 times," an unidentified witness told Radio Caracol. "His chauffeur was 
seriously injured and taken to a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's judges went on strike Thursday to demand increased protection. 
They struck after gunmen hired by drug dealers killed Magistrate Carlos 
Valencia Garcia in Bogota on Wednesday night. That killing also prompted the 50 
magistrates in Bogota's appellate court to hand in their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Garcia, 43, had rejected court motions to exonerate two leaders of the 
Medellin cartel who were accused in the 1987 slaying of a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the strike and Franklin Quintero's slaying, Justice Minister Monica 
de Grieff said: "It's terrifying what is happening in Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting together -- the 
government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry -- to stop the wave of 
violence," she said in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
She appealed to the country's more than 4,000 judges and magistrates to end 
their strike so traffickers don't "achieve their goal of halting the 
administration of justice." 
</P>
<P>
Today's attack was the latest in several drug-related killings in Medellin, 
Colombia's second-largest city and its industrial center. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, two officials investigating the activities of cocaine 
kingpin Pablo Escobar Gaviria have been slain. On Thursday night, an armed band 
intercepted a police van carrying 18 people who had been arrested and set them 
free. They included several suspected drug traffickers.

Syrian gunners fired 120 rockets today at the only passenger vessel that serves 
the Christian enclave, wounding seven people on the wharf and causing the ship 
to flee for Cyprus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
It left behind hundreds trying to escape the artillery war that has killed 779 
people and wounded 2,104, by police count, in five months. 
</P>
<P>
The sea route to Cyprus is the only link to the outside for the 1 million 
Christians of the 310-square-mile enclave, sealed on the other three sides by 
Syrian soldiers, guns and tanks. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the Syrians opened up with truck-mounted multiple 
rocket launchers soon after midnight as the hydrofoil Santa Maria docked at 
Jounieh, a Christian port 12 miles north of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"Arriving passengers had just disembarked, and departing passengers were 
gathered on the dock to board the vessel when the rocketing started," said a 
spokesman for the Jounieh Port Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Mansour, spokesman for Santa Maria's agents in Larnaca, Cyprus, said 
rockets began exploding around the ship before the crew had unloaded the 
baggage of 120 passengers who got off at Jounieh. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight of the 300 waiting passengers had boarded when the Santa Maria 
sailed away, and six of the eight passports still were in the hands of Jounieh 
port officials.

Police opened fire today on black employees outside a pie factory where they 
had been locked out by management. At least 15 workers were injured, police and 
union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police also arrested anti-apartheid activist Mohammed Valli Moosa, an official 
of the banned United Democratic Front and a leader of a new campaign to defy 
apartheid restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested at his Johannesburg office today and held there as security 
police searched his files. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication what charges might be filed against Valli 
Moosa, one of three activists who escaped from detention last year and took 
sanctuary at the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Allied Workers Union said scores of workers assembled today 
outside the Mama's Pies factory on Johannesburg's southeastern outskirts, a day 
after the company locked them out because of a 4-week wage dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The union said police used whips and live ammunition to disperse the workers 
and made several arrests. The union said 15 workers were injured, some 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Trevor Tutu, son of Nobel Prize-winning Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu, was sentenced today to 18 months in prison for allegedly making a 
false bomb threat at Johannesburg's international airport. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu's 32-year-old son was convicted of violating the Aviation Act by falsely 
telling police that there was a bomb in his luggage.

An appeals court today agreed to a new trial for Christer Pettersson, convicted 
in the slaying of Prime Minister Olof Palme, the national TT news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede with a criminal record, was sentenced to life 
in prison last month after his conviction. He denied shooting Palme and 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also appealed because it wanted also to convict Pettersson of 
attempted murder in the wounding of Palme's widow, Lisbeth, who was slightly 
wounded in the attack in February, 1986. Pettersson was convicted of the lesser 
charge of endangering Lisbeth Palme's life.

EX-REP. JENRETTE GETS 30-DAY TERM FOR SHOPLIFTING, SAYS HE'S BROKE

Former Rep. John Jenrette was fined $200 and sentenced to 30 days in jail today 
for shoplifting clothes at a suburban Washington store, and his attorney said 
the penalty may trigger more prison time for his Abscam bribery conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Jenrette, who spent 13 months in prison and was forced out of office for 
accepting a $50,000 bribe from undercover agents, was taken into custody after 
Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jack Stevens pronounced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Jenrette, 53, once a Democratic congressman from South Carolina, was convicted 
in June of stealing a pair of shoes and a tie from a Marshall's department 
store in Vienna and altering price tags on a shirt and pair of pants. 
</P>
<P>
Jenrette apologized to the court before sentencing, saying: "I have great 
remorse for this. I've totally wiped out all of my income and have lost any 
chance of getting my law license back. " He said he is in therapy six days a 
week for alcoholism and other mental health problems and to try to learn why he 
does such destructive things.

RITE AID DRUG PRESIDENT PLEADS INNOCENT TO BRIBERY CHARGES

The president of Rite Aid Corp., the nation's largest drugstore chain, pleaded 
innocent today to charges that he bribed a state Pharmacy Board member, and the 
case was assigned to a judge who previously issued rulings favorable to Rite 
Aid. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Grass, 35, did not speak during his arraignment before Cuyahoga County 
Common Pleas Judge Jose Villanueva; his plea was entered by his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Grass and the corporation are charged with one count each of bribery and 
possession of criminal tools -- the corporate jet on which Grass flew to meet 
Pharmacy Board member Melvin Wilczynski of Toledo at Cleveland Hopkins 
International Airport on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
Grass was arrested after sheriff's deputies videotaped his meeting with 
Wilczynski at a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Rite Aid has claimed that the $33,000 check for Wilczynski represented money 
that the Shiremanstown, Pa., drugstore chain owed Wilczynski as part of an 
agreement with another chain Rite Aid purchased last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the case was assigned -- by random draw -- to Judge Lillian Greene, 
who issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month halting the 
processing and service of the indictments on Grass and the corporation, ruling 
that they violated a gag order she imposed in June.

INFLATION INDEX UP A MODEST .2% IN JULY;

DROP IN PRICES OF GASOLINE, APPAREL CITED IN SLOWDOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer inflation rose a modest 0.2% in July, held down by the sharpest drop 
in gasoline prices in nearly three years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the Labor Department's consumer price index last month matched 
the gain in June. Together, the two reports showed the mildest two-month 
inflation picture since July-August of 1986 and marked a sharp contrast to 
surging prices in the first five months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the recent slowdown, prices for the first seven months of 1989 rose 
at a 5.5% annual rate, more than a full percentage point higher than the 4.4% 
increases in both 1988 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gasoline, Apparel Cited 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the most recent dampening of cost pressures reflected 
drops in prices of gasoline and apparel, particularly women's clothing, and a 
moderate rise in food costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more good news," said economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group, a 
Washington consulting firm. "The overall trend has been that the economy is, in 
fact, achieving the soft landing everyone was hoping for. In other words, 
growth is continuing, but inflation is under control." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the department said the moderation in inflation produced 
a 1.5% jump in Americans' average real earnings, to $338.01 a week. It was the 
largest advance since February, 1982, and followed a slight 0.1% gain in June. 
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the inflation news, the stock market dipped slightly in early 
trading today. Analysts said traders believed the price moderation was not 
dramatic enough to spur the Federal Reserve Board into loosening credit any 
time soon. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Kennebunkport, Me., presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, 
"We believe inflation is on a downward trend (and) . . . lower inflation should 
take the pressure off interest rates." The Administration has been pressuring 
the Fed not to choke off economic growth, which would sharply reduce tax 
revenue and inflate the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices, after shooting up 21.2% in the first five months of the year, 
fell 1% in June and dropped an additional 2.2% in July, the sharpest decline 
since October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
However, fuel oil costs rose 1.5% last month, reversing June's decline of 1.2%, 
and natural gas was up 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Food and beverage costs rose a moderate 0.3% in July following a 0.2% June 
gain. That was a moderation from the first five months of the year, when the 
lingering effects of last year's drought sent food prices up at a 9.3% annual 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing costs were down 0.8% last month, following a 1.1% decline in June. 
Prices for women's and girls' apparel fell 2% and those for infants and 
toddlers dropped 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department attributed the declines to larger-than-usual 
end-of-the-season price discounts for women's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The price of goods and services other than food and energy rose 0.4%, driven up 
by a 2% gain for tobacco but dampened by a 0.4% decline for new cars.

A couple will have to drink a lot of java between now and 1991 to redeem all

Joyce and Dwight Spates recently found 254 discount coupons totaling $101.60 in 
a 1-pound can of Sanka brand coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyce was making coffee for friends, and there was a coupon in the first scoop 
out of a newly opened can, then another in the next scoop until she had pulled 
out three or four coupons," Spates said. They emptied the coffee into a bowl 
and ended up with half a can of coffee and half a can of 40-cent coupons. 
</P>
<P>
Spates said he called the maker of Sanka to report the coupon bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the man who answered the phone at General Foods that we don't usually 
drink Sanka coffee and asked him if all the cans have this many coupons in 
them," Spates said.

UNISYS TO CUT 6,000 WORKERS BY END OF 1990

Unisys Corp. today announced that it will cut more than 6,000 jobs -- as much 
as 8% of its work force -- by the end of next year in a restructuring plan to 
battle weak domestic demand and stiffer competition in the computer industry 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys, formed by the 1986 merger of Sperry Corp. and Burroughs Corp., also 
said that by September it will complete a review of all its operations that 
will include the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have examined in detail both our strategies since the merger and their 
operational execution," chairman and chief executive officer W. Michael 
Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic strategies are working as planned . . . but our operational 
profitability has clearly been inadequate for several reasons, including the 
need to work off excess inventories, weaker than expected U.S. demand and 
sharper competition in all industry segments worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal said the company will cut annual costs by at least $400 million by 
the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, Unisys plans to cut its worldwide work force by 7% to 8% 
through attrition and layoffs, spokesman Michael A. Stugrin said. That amounts 
to between 6,000 and 7,000 workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Unisys has been under a hiring and salary freeze since the end of the 
second quarter, the employees who retire or leave the company will not be 
replaced, Stugrin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a major focus of the job cuts will be in the United States, where, he 
said "the softest market conditions prevail, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Unisys has "taken pains to make sure our people understand the 
trends in the industry and in the marketplace" and that the company has "a 
sense of determination to see this through and go on to better conditions."

Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson may face each other in a $1-million, 100-meter race 
after Johnson's ban for steroid use expires in September of 1990, Lewis' 
manager today. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Douglas said there were many sponsors and television companies ready to put 
up the money, but declined to name them. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl is ready to race if the (money) package is right," Douglas said in West 
Berlin, where Lewis was competing in a Mobil Grand Prix track and field meet 
today. 
</P>
<P>
He said Lewis wanted $1 million to compete, while Johnson probably would get 
less. Another condition, Douglas said, was that Johnson submit to doping tests 
every week of the final three months of his suspension, which expires Sept. 27, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was banned for two years after testing positive for steroids at the 
1988 Olympics. He was stripped of his gold medal and the world record of 9.79 
seconds.

DALLAS GREEN IS OUT, BUCKY DENT IS IN AS MANAGER OF YANKEES

<P>
George Steinbrenner fired Dallas Green today and hired Bucky Dent, the 17th 
time the owner has changed managers since buying the New York Yankees in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Green took over the team at the start of the season and was given a two-year 
contract. But with the Yankees in sixth place in the American League East, 
Steinbrenner ordered a change. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, the hero of the Yankees' 1978 miracle comeback and playoff victory over 
the Boston Red Sox, becomes the 10th different manager under Steinbrenner. Dent 
had been managing the Yankees' Class AAA Columbus team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worked Hard' 
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Bucky, who has worked hard for this chance," Steinbrenner said. "I 
still consider Dallas to be a close friend." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner also said there will be changes in the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in Detroit, where the Yankees are playing a weekend 
series with the Tigers. New York beat Detroit 2-1 Thursday night in Green's 
last game. 
</P>
<P>
The move came as a surprise to the Yankee players, who were not told of the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know about it," second baseman Steve Sax said when reached in his 
hotel room today. "I respect Dallas and feel bad for him. It's been tough with 
the injuries we've had, and I thought he did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
There were signs that Steinbrenner might make a move. He had stepped up public 
criticism of Green in the last week but insisted, "I'm still supportive of my 
manager and have no plans to replace him." 
</P>
<P>
Green was hired Oct. 7, 1988, and seemed confident that he could work with 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel comfortable with the deal Mr. Steinbrenner has put together for me," 
Green said at the time. "Any management situation is liable to explode. I know 
it's part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Green could not be reached by telephone in his hotel room today, and 
Steinbrenner was not receiving any calls. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees won their first game of the season but lost their next seven and 
have been over .500 only briefly since then. They have struggled without power 
hitter Dave Winfield, who has not played this year, and a pitching staff that 
was completely revamped under Green. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees are 56-65 and 7 1/2 games behind Baltimore. New York pitchers are 
last in the league with a 4.54 earned run average. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner wanted a manager from outside the Yankees' organization and 
brought in the strong-willed Green, along with many of Green's favorite 
coaches, and promised them freedom to run the team. But that lasted only into 
spring training, when Steinbrenner gave contracts to aging pitchers Tommy John 
and Ron Guidry over Green's objections. 
</P>
<P>
John, ironically, won the season opener but was ineffective later and soon was 
released. Guidry, trying to come back from elbow surgery, pitched poorly for 
Dent in the minors and retired before getting back to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, whose three-run home run in the playoff against the Red Sox helped the 
Yankees to a 5-4 victory, led Columbus to 68-62 record despite a constant 
shuttling of players to the parent club.
