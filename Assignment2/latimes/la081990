George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey (Disney Sunday at 9 p.m.): Through the 
compassion and filmmaking skills of his son George Stevens Jr., the life and 
work of director George Stevens make a compelling drama. His was a deeply 
American life with a shadow of sadness over its last third and more that is as 
moving as the best novels. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
I Walk the Line (Cinemax Monday at 11 a.m.): John Frankenheimer's underrated 
1970 drama starring Gregory Peck as a rural sheriff who falls disastrously in 
love with a moonshiner's daughter (Tuesday Weld). (1:35) 
</P>
<P>
Shadow of a Doubt (TMC Thursday at 8 p.m.): Hitchcock's favorite among his 
films, in which a nice Santa Rosa family is visited by a charming cousin 
(Joseph Cotten) who beguiles the daughter of the family (Teresa Wright). A 
subtle, gripping 1943 tale of small-town innocence menaced by a dangerous 
outsider. (1:48) 
</P>
<P>
Ground Zero (Showtime Saturday at 6:05 a.m., again at 3:05 p.m.): An 
outstanding 1987 Australian political thriller suggesting that nuclear tests 
had been done in Australia by Britain between 1953 and 1964 with a callous 
disregard for Australian military personnel as well as countless nomadic 
aborigines. (1:49)

I think it's a good thing Ethan Canin left medical school to be a story writer. 
Judging from "The Scientific Method" (yawn, ho-hum), he might have become 
dangerous and been a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for the Sandra Cisneros piece, "Woman Hollering Creek"; that was 
sensational.

TALES FOR A SUMMER DAY

I congratulate Sandra Cisneros for her masterpiece of derogatory terms against 
Hispanic immigrants, especially Mexicans, in her "Woman Hollering Creek." 
Cisneros must have a superiority complex when she looks at other persons of her 
own race. 
</P>
<P>
Her story concentrates on searching out the wrong behavior of new immigrants. 
The unnecessary abuse of the Spanish language while she is writing in English 
makes her story look even more grotesque and awkward. It seems like Cisneros is 
ashamed of her ancestors, their traditions, their "criminal" ignorance and 
their mistaken habits. 
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for Chicano authors to remember that they are descendants of 
peasants. They should never expect great discourses from their parents or 
relatives, who came to this country as manual workers; it's not their fault 
that they are not educated in the literary arts. They have contributed to the 
magnificence of the country with their hard work -- and by paying taxes to 
finance the university educations that people like Cisneros enjoyed. Most 
immigrants brought with them their traditions and culture, they taught the 
Spanish language to their children hoping to preserve their roots. Now those 
children feel dishonor about being Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
So that, Chicano authors escape from their frustrations by writing the trash 
that makes their ancestors look so bad.

Oh, the joy of feasting once again on a magazine of short stories ("Tales for a 
Summer Day," July 1). 
</P>
<P>
When I was growing up, such magazines as Liberty, Collier's and Saturday 
Evening Post were eagerly awaited and their short stories devoured upon 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Then such magazines disappeared, forever, we thought. Then Los Angeles Times 
Magazine brings back the days of my girlhood, and with such beautiful stories. 
None of that esoteric stuff I can hardly comprehend, but human stories about 
real people. 
</P>
<P>
Keep it up! Maybe the young people will come back to the pleasures of reading 
instead of their robotic TV watching.

I enjoyed last June's cover story on the differences between dads in real life 
and on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there did appear to be a difference, especially in TV's early series -- 
and all to the good, it seems to me. 
</P>
<P>
Your story didn't mention the father of them all -- Charlie Ruggles, who 
starred in "The Ruggles." It was a comedy series that aired for three years on 
ABC from 1949 to 1952, but that probably was before writer Joe Rhodes was born. 
Too bad -- he missed some good shows.

Kudos to KNBC for its excellent coverage of the opening of the Richard M. Nixon 
Library in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
My health prevented me from attending in person, but thanks to Channel 4, I was 
still able to enjoy the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
This was a historic event regardless of how a person feels about the former 
President. The four Presidents together (Nixon, George Bush, Ronald Reagan, 
Gerald Ford) made quite a picture, as did their First Ladies. Thanks again, 
KNBC. I think you've won a new viewer of your news.

LONG JUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sleek. Stretchy. Undeniably catlike. This year's jumpsuit -- a catsuit if the 
pant legs are tight -- has evolved from exercise leotards, with a fit close 
enough to make exercise clearly worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Designed with movement in mind, jumpsuits now are shaped from technologically 
advanced fabrics that mold to the body. Fall/winter colors -- curry, raisin -- 
are bold but not flamboyant. The look is 21st-Century modern, with not a hint 
of retro about it. 
</P>
<P>
Along with stretch, new details include hidden zippers or Velcro closures and 
stirrups. 
</P>
<P>
To vary the look, bibbed jumpsuits can be worn with dressy or sporty tops. But 
in keeping with a sophisticated sportswear concept, accessories are simple -- a 
wide belt and understated jewelry, all grounded, of course, with ankle boots.

LATE BLOOMERS;

NEW 'NAKED LADIES' HAVE PETALS OF WHITE, YELLOW OR RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Magazine.

<P>
A nurseryman trying to describe to a customer what the fat, papery bulbs of 
Amaryllis belladonna would look like when they bloomed was having no luck. 
Until he said: "It's the bulb that grows in vacant lots, the one with the big 
pink flowers." That did it. 
</P>
<P>
Amaryllis belladonna are hard to miss because they bloom when and where very 
little else does (in the middle of summer, in completely dry soil). "They're 
amazing," says Polly Anderson, whose back yard in La Canada Flintridge is full 
of the bulbs. "They need absolutely no water, and they grow in sun or shade." 
</P>
<P>
Their common name, naked ladies, refers to the fact that flower without leaves. 
The leaves comes later, usually in October -- in time to take advantage of 
winter's rains -- and last until late spring. Typically, they are shiny, dark 
green, and strap-shaped, growing in clumps two to three feet across but only 
about 18 inches tall. The bulbs then go dormant until the first flowers push 
out of the bare ground in August. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's naked ladies, however, bloom in September -- she has been 
hybridizing them over the past 40 years. In her yard, they grow under a large 
Aleppo pine and around citrus and eucalyptus that are about 100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
In the Anderson garden, however, they are not just pink. She has developed 
plants with flowers of pink with white throats, pure china white, white with 
creamy yellow or apricot throats and a dark pink that most people simply call 
red. Her flowers are bigger than the standard type, growing atop taller stems. 
Flowers make a circle around the stem; the common pink makes but a quarter 
circle, with most of the flowers facing the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the bulbs grow in full sun, others in complete (but bright) shade. Some 
grow from under a ground covering of cape weed (Arctotheca calendula, which 
does not need summer water, either) and some from a mulch of pine needles, but 
most send the sturdy reddish-brown stems from bare dirt. The bed under the 
Aleppo pine has the largest number of bulbs and flowers. Anderson suspects that 
this is because she waters that bed in the winter for the narcissus growing 
there. Where other beds get no water at all, the bulbs grow more slowly but 
just as surely. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson does not fertilize at all; according to growers she has talked to 
fertilizer can contribute to the early demise of bulbs, causing them to rot. So 
can summer watering, though the bulbs can take a certain amount. In some beds 
she does not even bother to weed; the weeds seem to be unable to overwhelm the 
amaryllis. She notes that even the cape weed, a very tough plant from South 
Africa that looks much like a gazania, has trouble growing into the bed of 
amaryllis because the ground is so dry. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson began her hybridizing with a dark rosy-pink amaryllis that grows 
nearly wild in Santa Cruz, in Northern California, and a nice white named 
'Hathor' that she found in Santa Barbara. It has been a long, slow process 
because it takes five to six years from seed to flowering bulb. The seeds are 
easy to grow, she says, and they are simply sown in the ground, in neat little 
rows as if they were corn. The seeds sprout right along with the foliage on the 
parent plants, in early fall, and even these seedlings should be allowed to go 
dry in summer. 
</P>
<P>
If she doesn't plan to save seed, she snaps off the seed heads after the last 
flowers fade, to help conserve the bulbs' energy. The flower head breaks off 
cleanly with a crisp pop. Some of her amaryllis are growing in pots, but, she 
says, they don't flower well or at all in some cases, much preferring the dry 
open ground. Some also grow at the bases of the taller crinum lilies that 
flower at the same time with very similar flowers but with foliage, even though 
the leaves of the crinums are often tipped with brown and beginning to dry. 
</P>
<P>
At the Palos Verdes Begonia Farm (which, despite the name, is a large, general 
nursery), John Bauman makes sure he gets a few bins of bulbs each fall, and, in 
general, the bulbs of the common pink are not difficult to find at nurseries. 
Anderson's hybrids are carried only by Burkard Nurseries in Pasadena, cost a 
great deal more and are in very limited supply, because she digs up each one 
herself, with a bloom attached so that you know what you are buying. They can 
stay out of the ground for several weeks this way, but then should be planted 
so they can make new roots and leaves in the fall. They may not bloom the next 
year, but the following. Plant bulbs just under the ground with the very tops 
of the necks sticking out. In general, it is best not to dig or divide clumps 
of amaryllis because it does take them at least a year to become reestablished 
and begin flowering again. 
</P>
<P>
The flowers of the common pink and the hybrids are excellent cut, fragrant and 
long-lived, lasting a week or two in a vase. 
</P>
<P>
Several large bulb growers have shown interest in the Anderson hybrids, so some 
day they may be more generally available, but in the meantime there is nothing 
wrong at all with the readily available plain pink of vacant lots. Their return 
to cultivated gardens is long overdue, and they will smile at the next drought. 
</P>

THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM with the Vienna Children's Museum Furniture 
Collection: Kids may have a hard time keeping their parents away from it. Guy 
Cnop, owner of Linea-Ligne Roset, says he's been playing with the colorful 
furniture since the day it arrived at his shop. 
</P>
<P>
The pegboard-like pieces (recommended for children ages 2 through 8) were 
developed by E. Warlamis, a Greek architect living in Austria. The line, 
exhibited at the Vienna Museum of Applied Arts, features three chairs ($112 to 
$119) in the shapes of a hill, a house and a tree; a house cupboard ($468), and 
a crescent-shape desk ($171). These are accompanied by an architecture game set 
($38) composed of 20 simple forms -- cubes, semicircles, cones, clouds, a tree 
and a bird -- that children use to create unique environments by inserting them 
(with pegs) into the perforated furniture. Children become landscapers and 
urban planners, and the variety of their fantasy domains is limitless: from 
bucolic scenes of rolling hills, clouds and medieval castles to futuristic 
cities of skyscrapers, tunnels and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The pieces are available in either natural pine or bright red, yellow and 
green. Chairs come in two seat heights (about 12 inches and 14 inches) and can 
support the weight of an adult -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vienna Children's Museum Furniture Collection is sold at Linea-Ligne 
Roset, 8840-A Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 273-5425.

OUTTAKES: DOGFIGHT?

<TEXT>
<P>
Though George Lucas recently staked his claim to the story of the Tuskegee 
Airmen -- a much-decorated World War II black fighter squadron -- he may have 
some competition. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Williams, a veteran of both show business and the corporate world who flew 
50 missions for the Tuskegee group, has been working since 1952 to bring the 
story to the screen. His version is now in development at Columbia Pictures. 
Like Lucas' "Red Tails," it is budgeted in the $25-$30 million range and 
expects to have a shooting script within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia chairman Frank Price has been personally involved with the Tuskegee 
project since the mid-'80s, when he headed Universal. Though he has yet to 
greenlight the picture, he said through a spokesman that Lucas' announcement 
will have no impact on his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has enlisted the support of the Tuskegee Airmen Inc., whose scholarship 
fund stands to benefit from the film. Williams said he bypassed the group 
because he has no interest in "making a film by committee." Moreover, claims 
Williams, his project has several things in its favor: the involvement of Price 
(whom he calls "one of the best story and business minds in the industry"); the 
fact that it was written "by someone who was there," and his approach, which 
will be more "socially significant" than the action-adventure angle Lucas has 
described. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Melton, historian for the Tuskegee Airmen, has doubts that there's room 
for two such films in the marketplace. But, he adds, no one in his camp is 
losing any sleep. "George Lucas' stature is so enormous that no one else has a 
chance," he says. "If anyone tried to take him on, it would be like fighting a 
battleship with a wooden sword." Lucas was out of town and unavailable for 
comment. Elaine Dutka

OUTTAKES: HENDRIX, UNFILMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pat H. Broeske 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janis Joplin got the feature-film treatment in the fictionalized "The Rose" 
(1979). Jim Morrison's life will be dramatized in Oliver Stone's upcoming "The 
Doors." But a feature film about legendary rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix -- who 
died in 1970 at 27 -- is still without voltage. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Douglas, who supervises the production of the Hendrix music catalogues and 
related merchandising (including the upcoming concert video of Hendrix's last 
major concert -- at the Isle of Wight Festival), says he receives a steady 
stream of scripts -- many of them from independent producers and "smaller 
studios" that promise financing. At present, "a stack about 3 1/2 feet tall is 
sitting in my office." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, says Douglas, "they all say the same thing -- nothing. We've 
yet to see one that's got something to say about him that's special." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who produced Band of Gypsies -- Hendrix's final group -- says there 
were talks several years ago with Warner Bros. and various filmmakers. "But 
nothing ever got going. I don't think anyone understood how to write the 
story," says Douglas, who claims "Jimi was all music. That's what he was about. 
Consequently, you don't have the colorful stories of a Jim Morrison or a Janis 
Joplin. There are no sordid stories." 
</P>
<P>
But, what about all those tales -- many of which have made their way into 
assorted Hendrix bios -- about the sensuous rocker's appetite for women -- and 
drugs? 
</P>
<P>
"So what! The guy was a superstar at 25. Sure he had a lot of women. And, yeah, 
he did drugs -- like everyone else. But his isn't the story of a junkie." 
Stressing that Hendrix died of asphyxiation when he choked on his own vomit -- 
"not from a straight overdose" -- Douglas adds, "sex and drugs were a part of 
the backdrop of the times. But they weren't what he was about." 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that Douglas is being too protective of Hendrix? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm protective, in that I don't want some movie to go beyond the 
truth in an attempt to find some offstage madness and satanic drama. 
</P>
<P>
"Because that wasn't Jimi's story. Jimi changed the music. He's a reference 
point to every musician who ever picked up an instrument. I haven't seen the 
script that captures that part of Jimi, the metaphysical part that asks where 
did the muse come from." Pat H. Broeske

LADIES HOME PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am 30 years old, and I am sick of the slurs that housewife and motherhood 
receive in our modern world, especially through the media. We are made to 
believe that life is much better now for women because of the women's 
liberation movement. 
</P>
<P>
I beg to differ. At no other time has our country been crippled from the 
effects of divorce, adultery, alcohol and drug abuse, wife and child abuse, 
apathy, and moral and spiritual lethargy. At no time has the traditional family 
been under such attack. And today mothers are less in the home than ever 
before. 
</P>
<P>
May I suggest that the "dreary and isolated drudgery" that some women face is 
in trying to be liberated from their traditional role and missing the simple 
pleasures of keeping a well-ordered and healthy home? Please don't assume that 
meeting the basic needs of one's family with efficiency and economy cannot be a 
pleasurable thing.

LADIES HOME PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Smith's essay bothered me. I'm 30 years old, and my contribution to our 
family income is the five house-cleaning jobs I do every week. 
</P>
<P>
In a society where essentially no one remains at home to carry on with "dreary 
and isolated drudgery," workers like myself are critically in demand and can 
command a respectable wage for our services. 
</P>
<P>
The sincere gratitude I receive from the working moms makes me a little sad; 
they often seem so frazzled when they get home. Their dependency on my service 
makes me feel guilty when I have to quit a job at their house. There may be 
some hard looking before they will find a trustworthy, responsible replacement 
to come into their home. But it's always easier for me to clean for a single 
person or a couple rather than a family of four. If I have to let a client go 
because of my own time constraints, families are the first to go. It seems like 
a tough approach, but I'm running a business, after all.

Bridge BCD 9008 (compact disc). Wuorinen, the ultimate maximalist even when 
writing for solo piano ("Blue Bamboula"), solo violin ("The Long and the 
Short") or the two together ("Six Pieces," "Spinoff" and "Fantasia"), composes 
music that is dense in notes and allusion. He demands much of performers -- the 
two here are outstanding -- and listeners, far more than most of the latter 
will think is worth the effort. William Ratliff

DONIZETTI: "MARIA STUARDA." Edita Gruberova, Agnes Baltsa, Francisco Araiza, 
Simone Alaimo; Chorus of the Bavarian Radio; Munchner Rundfunkorchester 
conducted by Giuseppe Patane. 
</P>
<P>
Philips 426 233 (two compact discs). Although "Maria Stuarda" has received 
three earlier commercial recordings, none has sustained the lyrical elements of 
the 1834 work so completely as this latest effort. Baltsa's Elizabeth I and 
Gruberova's Mary Stuart are evenly matched rivals in the epithet-slinging 
encounter in Fotheringay Park, the opera's juiciest dramatic episode. Gruberova 
lends pathos to Mary's famous prayer, and although Baltsa's voice has acquired 
a steely edge, she bestows a measure of finesse on the conventional villain 
Donizetti has made of the queen. Araiza does what he can with the third side of 
the triangle. Credit is due Patane, who died shortly after making the 
recording; his seasoned leadership lends the whole project considerable pulse 
and idiomatic flair. ALLAN ULRICH

"THE MANY MOODS OF THE GUITAR." Lynn Harting-Ware, guitar. Acoma GXD 5732 
(compact disc). 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian guitarist enlarges the instrument's neo-classical repertory -- not 
an urgent task -- with this disc of mostly fresh material, led by Richard 
Smoot's Brouweresque "Music for the Waiting Angel," Kathy Henkel's deftly 
shaped "River Sky" mysteries and Peter Ware's pungent, poignant "Nakina" suite. 
Her essentially lyric way with the music leaves its tensions understated, but 
revels in the easier intimacies of color and liquid tone. JOHN HENKEN

Suite. Yehudi Menuhin and Edna Michell, violins; Carol Wincenc, flute; Brooklyn 
Philharmonic, conducted by Foss.

<P>
New World Records, NW 375-2 (compact disc). Renaissance and Baroque styles, in 
well-performed, modern instrumental dress, spring alive in the beautiful 
concerto and suite. The 1983 revision of the original 1972 "Orpheus" is a 
sparely scored yet terrifying evocation of a descent into hell, with an 
impassioned love duet (two violins) before violent death. WILLIAM RATLIFF

*** BOB GELDOF "THE VEGETARIANS OF LOVE" ATLANTIC: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE 
OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This earthy album could save Live Aid's instigator from living embalmment in 
pop-star humanitarianism. There is nothing more unpretentious than the Irish 
folk strains that dominate the record, and Geldof undertakes his Celtic roots 
renewal with a commingling of the Waterboys' reverence and the Pogues' 
roughneck charm. 
</P>
<P>
For Geldof, the real St. Bob is Dylan -- a pervasive influence here, along with 
Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks" mysticism. Geldof mulls the fate of the world 
about a third of the time, with mixed artistic results ranging from the leaden 
"Thinking Voyager 2 Type Things" to the invigorating "Chains of Pain." 
</P>
<P>
But the best songs are directed inward, where Geldof finds the private soul as 
susceptible to starvation as the Third World masses. "No Small Wonder" is a 
fine evocation of how transcendence (represented in a stirring instrumental 
chorus) and emptiness exert a simultaneous, omnipresent tug on our lives. MIKE 
BOEHM

BLUES POWER: Columbia Records will inaugurate its new "Roots 'N Blues" series 
with the release of "Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings," a long-awaited 
two-CD (three album) boxed set featuring 41 existing takes of Johnson's 29 
known songs (plus extensive liner notes and appreciations by Keith Richards and 
Eric Clapton). Due out at the end of the month, the series will also include 
"Good Time Tonight" by Big Bill Broonzy, "Steppin' On the Blues" by Lonnie 
Johnson and "The Big Three Trio," featuring early pre-Chess work by Willie 
Dixon. . . . MCA Records is due to release "Bo Diddley: The Chess Box" this 
week, an ambitious 45-song set that includes Diddley's hits as well as such 
obscurities as "You Know I Love You," a 1960 doo-wop session with the Flamingos 
with Bo singing doo-wop lead. 
</P>
<P>
The set also offers a 24-page souvenir booklet full of rare photos. On deck 
from MCA: an Elton John boxed-set with a host of rare tracks, which is due in 
October. . . . Meanwhile, PolyGram is releasing a boxed set of its own, "The 
Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition," which will be out next month. The CD 
compilation features remixed versions of many original "Layla" tunes, alternate 
versions of such songs as "To Tell the Truth," "Mean Old World" and "Have You 
Ever Loved a Woman" and -- best of all -- never-before released jams featuring 
Clapton with Duane and Gregg Allman and Dicky Betts.

POP EYE: VEGA TAKES A SPIN ON THE DANCE FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has Suzanne Vega been getting down? Shaking her booty? Working the funk? 
</P>
<P>
Strange but true -- almost. The waif-like pop songstress, best known for 
"Luka," a beguiling tale of child abuse, has suddenly become the queen of 
London's trendy club scene, thanks to her sinewy, Soul II Soul-style dance hit 
"Tom's Diner." 
</P>
<P>
But here's what really makes the song, already at No. 2 on the British singles 
chart, such an oddity: Vega's original version of the record (from her 
"Solitude Standing" album) was performed a cappella. In fact, Vega was just as 
startled as her record company, A&amp;M Records, when they discovered club 
deejays touting the new dance version. 
</P>
<P>
What happened along the way is one of those wonderfully loopy pop escapades 
that recalls the fly-by-night excitement of the music industry's misspent 
youth. According to A&amp;M execs, a pair of British club deejays, who go by 
the moniker DNA, were such fans of "Tom's Diner" that they simply recorded a 
bootleg version of the song, adding their own funk-style backing track. The 
deejays were selling privately pressed copies when they found a music fan who 
was particularly intrigued with the record -- one of A&amp;M's London A&amp;R 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
"The first conversation we apparently had with the deejays was our informing 
them that what they were doing was completely illegal," explains Al Cafaro, 
A&amp;M's senior vice president and general manager. "But the second 
conversation was, 'Let's make a deal.' We essentially bought back our own 
record from them." 
</P>
<P>
By then A&amp;M realized it had a potential hit on its hands. "It's like found 
art," says Cafaro. "It's a totally new song. It sounds so wild -- and so 
different -- that I couldn't believe at first that it was really Suzanne, 
because it was in such a different context." 
</P>
<P>
After getting the blessing of Vega and her management, A&amp;M struck a deal 
and officially released the song -- but not without certain reservations. "Our 
U.K. people obviously thought long and hard about this, because it's an unusual 
precedent to pay someone money for something you originally owned," says 
Cafaro. "But we've chosen to use this to our advantage. It gives people a 
chance to hear Suzanne in a way they've never heard her before. And any time 
you can give your artist a new spin -- and give their audience a new sense of 
their possibilities -- that's an opportunity that's hard to pass up." 
</P>
<P>
Cafaro says Vega happily endorsed the idea. "(A&amp;M) asked me what I thought 
of it and I told them it was really kind of nice," Vega recently told a British 
columnist. "So I said, 'Go ahead and release it.' I wasn't expecting it to be 
successful -- I never thought it would be that popular. It just seemed very 
charming." 
</P>
<P>
So far A&amp;M is treading lightly when it comes to handling the song's U.S. 
release. Several key modern-rock stations, including KROQ-FM, have been playing 
an import version of the song. A&amp;M is sending radio promo copies and is 
issuing a CD single (and 12-inch) to record stores -- but Cafaro says the label 
is holding off taking out trade ads and other marketing ploys until it sees how 
much response the song gets. A&amp;M has also shot a video of the song (without 
Vega), which it has given to dance clubs, but hasn't yet shipped over to MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we're waiting to see what happens," says Cafaro. "We think the 
song could end up on urban-contemporary radio or even (Top 40) stations like 
KIIS-FM or Power 106. We know it's not what you'd expect from Suzanne, but if 
radio programmers have some success with a Suzanne Vega record because of this 
song, then we'd be ecstatic."

WILD VIDEO: So who directed Chris Isaak's new video "Wicked Game"? Here's a 
hint -- the same guy who put the song in "Wild at Heart" . . . David Lynch. The 
film's quirky director used a pair of other Isaak songs, "Blue Spanish Sky" and 
"In the Heart of the Jungle," in the film's sound track. 
</P>
<P>
"Sky" and "Wicked Game" are featured on PolyGram's new "Wild at Heart" 
sound-track album, which also offers Nicholas Cage's syrupy renditions of 
Elvis' "Love Me Tender" and "Love Me," Gene Vincent's "Be Bop A Lula," Them's 
"Baby Please Don't Go" and "Up in Flames," a song penned by Lynch himself which 
is performed by blues queen Koko Taylor. . . . Meanwhile, Warners Records has 
slapped a promo sticker on Isaak's last album, reminding consumers that it 
features music from "Wild at Heart." Warners also is releasing a "Twin Peaks" 
sound track that contains a pair of Julee Cruise songs plus music (for new 
fall-season episodes) by composer Angelo Badalamenti. . . . "Drugstore Cowboy" 
director Gus Van Sant has produced a video starring beat-poet icon William S. 
Burroughs, which promotes "Dead City Radio," a new Burroughs spoken-word 
project adorned with original music from John Cale, Donald Fagen, Sonic Youth 
and Blondie's Chris Stein.

THE KEY TO HAPPINESS IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Patrick Goldstein's Aug. 5 profile of Steve Martin, "The Man Behind the 
Madness," Martin observes how living in the Lotus Land of L.A. can drive one to 
retrospective depression: "One day you look back and say, 'What did I do for 
the last 10 years, except figure out how to make a left turn on Santa Monica 
Boulevard?' " 
</P>
<P>
Well, it took me 16 years, but I finally figured it out: Pass the corner, go a 
block and turn right, then another right, then right again, and voila! The key 
to happiness in Los Angeles is never having to make a left turn.

DEFINING CORRECTNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Letter writer David Moss (Aug. 12) ought to know that indeed "(Sam) Kinison and 
Andrew Dice Clay -- as well as rock or rap groups such as Guns N' Roses and 
Public Enemy and their record company backers -- all feel they have the 
God-given right to say any damned thing they want to about anyone" because, in 
this country, they do. 
</P>
<P>
Too many times in America's history, this right was abrogated because whoever 
was speaking wasn't politically correct enough for whoever was defining 
political correctness at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Moss denounces censorship and hides his call for political correctness behind 
the megaterm "sensitivity/self-restraint/responsi-bility." Again, meanings vary 
with whoever's doing the defining. In the '60s, I called peaceful anti-war 
marches sensitive and responsible; Richard Nixon called them barbarous and 
treasonous. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not as good with quotes as Moss, so I don't recall who said "censorship is 
an opinion backed by an organization," but it's one quote we should all 
remember.

A LITTLE JOKE, MAYBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think that Terri D. Keville, in her Aug. 12 letter on David Shaw's "How to 
Train a Baby Gourmet," didn't get the joke. 
</P>
<P>
The article was clearly tongue-in-cheek. Surely no one is obtuse enough to 
declare that baby Lucas didn't "bother anyone" and then go on to describe the 
child as "banging his spoon and screeching with pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
It was a joke, Terri. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it. . . ?

SILENCE ON BIGOTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Boudreau's Aug. 12 article on "God's Country," a play about neo-Nazism, 
reflects the consequences of change in an America that has been too white, too 
greedy and too blind to its own weaknesses -- one of which is the belief that 
being white, and American, is somehow "special." 
</P>
<P>
The play will make a difference for a good minute! Most of the audiences will 
continue to be part of one of the country's biggest weaknesses -- that group 
known as the Silent Majority.

THE LIGHTWEIGHTS AND THE CRITICALLY APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't know what's funnier, Richard Marx thinking critics don't like him 
because of his hair or Hilburn doing a whole article on people like Marx 
griping about why people like Hilburn don't like him. Lighten up, guys! 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-nine percent of rock critics are a curiosity, nothing more. A sensible 
person gives no more thought to one of these scribblers than he would a 
television critic, a sportswriter or Geraldo. People like Hilburn are useful in 
gauging what the middle-of-the-road, hip-trendy, radical chic, yuppie crowd is 
thinking at any particular moment (these are very fickle people). 
</P>
<P>
Why should Marx, Phil Collins, Billy Joel and the rest of the "outs" care about 
the likes of Hilburn? As long as "Candy" and "Ronnie" keep buying their music 
and showing up at their concerts, why should they worry? 
</P>
<P>
They're never going to make music like Newman, Simon, Springsteen or U2. And 
the critics will probably turn on these "in" guys someday (they already have, 
in the case of the last two). Hey, it's only rock 'n' roll.

<P>
Re "Excuses, Excuses, Excuses" by Robert Hilburn, Aug. 12: 
</P>
<P>
I am so tired of pop bashing. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it so difficult to accept the idea that there is a place for pure pop 
music as well as rock? (I happen to appreciate all six artists in the article 
-- both the "lightweights" and the "critically profound and approved.") 
</P>
<P>
There are times when non-political and non-intellectual music can be a 
refreshing, feel-good, fun escape from reality! 
</P>
<P>
I can't help but wonder what Hilburn listens to at the beach . . . or is the 
beach too mindless an activity?

IS 'PROBLEM CHILD' A PROBLEM FOR PETS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing in a theater lobby recently, I was appalled by a poster for "Problem 
Child": To depict an animal helpless in a dryer is despicable. 
</P>
<P>
Did anyone stop to think how many impressionable children would attempt to 
emulate such an act because it appeared to be funny on film, and how many 
helpless animals will suffer as a result?

ART NOTEBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHER GREG GORMAN DOES AN ABOUT-FACE WITH NEW FOCUS ON 
NUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not as if photographer Greg Gorman is trying to escape from his 
identification with personality portraiture. After all, Gorman has built a 
valuable reputation and career these last 10 years with formal studies of some 
famed and notorious faces. 
</P>
<P>
His just-published first book, "Greg Gorman: Volume One," is a document to 
that, with a small chapter in the back reserved for his recent work with nude 
figures. But those arriving at the G. Ray Hawkins Gallery for Gorman's first 
major local exhibition might be surprised to find that his portraits of such 
figures as Andy Warhol, Bette Davis and Tom Waits are dominated by his 
lesser-known nude works. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy doing nudes," Gorman said, standing on the concrete floor at the Santa 
Monica gallery in blue jeans and a T-shirt. "And I felt it was important I do 
more personal work than just my celebrity portraiture. I've always been 
interested in personalities, per se, because I love people's faces. But I'm 
also interested in the human form." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nudes were created within the past two years, photographed between 
personality assignments under natural light at his West Hollywood studio. Many 
of the black and white works are portraits in themselves, including two of the 
imposing, chiseled figure of actress Brigitte Nielsen. And a six-panel series 
on model Tony Ward captures the male form in various stages of dynamic 
movement, like some updated version of an Eadweard Muybridge photographic 
motion study. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gorman's show offers several examples of the work that has made him in 
high demand at a variety of magazines, film studios and advertising agencies. 
An understated portrait of David Hockney shows the artist, in polka-dotted bow 
tie and cuffed corduroys, leaning forward in a rocking chair and obscuring his 
own face with a baseball cap. Nearby, a photograph of singer Michael Jackson 
under a black veil re-creates a similarly dark 1924 image by Edward Steichen of 
actress Gloria Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
"Primarily, most of my work is fairly premeditated," said Gorman, 41, an 
admirer of photographers Richard Avedon and Irving Penn. "I know, going into a 
photo session, what I'm going to do, although things always develop, change and 
progress during that time, as in any creative endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said he doesn't necessarily see the new book and exhibition as marking 
the beginning or end of any discernable phase of his career. Since leaving 
Kansas City and earning a cinematography degree at USC, Gorman has merely been 
working on establishing his style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still doing similar things, but changing in certain areas," he said. "If 
anything, I'm probably loosening up a little bit. I'm making the portraits a 
little less staid, a little less rigid and a little more open. Everybody's 
going to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Photography by Greg Gorman, through Sept. 5, G. Ray Hawkins Gallery, 910 
Colorado Ave., Santa Monica; (213) 394-5558. Open 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
WALKING THE LINE: There is little denying the infinite number of art careers 
that began quietly with some well-placed scratches on paper. And this month, 
the Richard-Bennett Gallery brings 22 local artists back to that intimate, 
early stage with an all-drawing exhibition called "Drawing the Line." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 24 works offer the traditional elements of pen, pencil and paper. 
But some in the group, which includes Tim Rollins, Raymond Pettibone, Jacci Den 
Hartog and Jorge Pardo, have opted to reinterpret the simple art form. 
</P>
<P>
Among the non-traditional drawings is Steve DeGroodt's "Digging Stick," which 
incorporates wire mesh into a charcoal and paper work. And Scott King's 
"Lifted," which was created especially for the show, reveals a message on 
typewriter correction tape mounted on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus really these days has been much more toward object-oriented work," 
said Dominica Salvatore, the gallery's associate director. "So this is sort of 
bringing it down to a much more intimate level." 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore added that a majority of the artists in the show no longer use 
drawing as a means of public expression. The exhibition offered these artists 
an opportunity to reveal a quieter side to their work. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make a more personal, low-key show for the summer, which included 
works with artists we've had interest in for a while," she said. "And drawing 
is a very personal statement." 
</P>
<P>
Drawings by 22 local artists, through Sept. 8, Richard-Bennett Gallery, 830 N. 
La Brea Ave., L.A.; (213) 962-8006. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A GIRL OF 60: The joke's unintentional, of course, but most cartoon characters 
never seem to age anywhere near as fast as their creators. That may have 
occurred to veteran animator Grim Natwick on Wednesday night. The co-creator of 
Betty Boop was to celebrate his 100th birthday at a gallery saluting the 
ageless image of the chanteuse heroine. 
</P>
<P>
The Circle Gallery in Beverly Hills is showing a variety of works depicting 
Betty Boop, first drawn in 1930. The show includes signed color and black and 
white lithographs by Natwick and nearly 100 animation cels from an early 1980s 
television revival. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the first female cartoon character that was provocative," said Marc 
Subias, director of animation art at the gallery. "She was curvy and sexy and 
saucy. She had a little wink. But at the same time, she was so innocent. She 
was a sexy heroine, and that was kind of a new thing for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The Circle Gallery, which owns 38 stores nationwide, has devoted a sizable 
amount of wall space to animation since 1974. Subsequent years have offered 
paintings, drawings and animation cels from Disney, Hanna-Barbera and famed 
Warner Bros. animators Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng. 
</P>
<P>
Subias said its clientele of fine art collectors, who have been attracted by 
Circle Gallery shows of Peter Max, LeRoy Neiman and, soon, Victor Vasarely, 
have often become interested in the animation exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more difficult to turn an animation collector into a fine art collector," 
Subias said. "But our fine art collectors recognize the importance of animation 
and will quite often attend the show, pleasantly surprised, and end up 
acquiring several animation cels." 
</P>
<P>
Artwork of cartoon character Betty Boop, including lithographs by co-creator 
Grim Natwick, through August, Circle Gallery, 329 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly 
Hills; (213) 273-1461. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 10 a.m. 
to 10 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.

367-POUND WOMAN PASSES TEST, KEEPS DRIVER'S LICENSE

<P>
A woman who was required to take a driving test because authorities thought she 
might be too fat to drive safely proved Friday she can operate a car even 
though she weighs 367 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Using a borrowed, beat-up Dodge Aspen that she had driven only once, Regina Guy 
passed the test with more than 75 people watching from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
A state motor vehicle hearing examiner ordered Friday morning that she pass the 
test or forfeit her license. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it. I'm legal, guys," Guy said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
She remained angry that she had to prove that her weight doesn't stop her from 
being a safe driver. 
</P>
<P>
"Fat people are human. We deserve equal treatment," said Guy, 25. "Because of 
my size, I should not be discriminated against." 
</P>
<P>
Guy's problems began July 13, when she was stopped because the lights were not 
working properly on another car she had borrowed from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
The officer wrote on his report to the Motor Vehicle Administration: "Due to 
this person's obesity, she was unable to sit behind the wheel of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Guy was sitting in the center of the seat and was using her left hand and left 
foot to drive the car, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that this driver should have special equipment on her car," the officer 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Guy, of Baltimore, denied that she was sitting in the center of the seat or was 
driving abnormally. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I sit in the center? I couldn't possibly drive from the center," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Guy sat behind the wheel of the car, which had no special equipment. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was unhappy that the officer was absent from Friday's hearing. "I 
still would like a chance to face my accuser," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance were at the 
hearing to support Guy. Among them was Peggy Williams, owner of the station 
wagon that Guy was driving when she was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair. It's just not fair," Williams said. "Why is she being singled 
out to take a test when she did nothing to indicate she was a bad driver?" 
</P>
<P>
Guy's lawyer, Christopher Brown, said it was a clear case of discrimination 
against fat people. "The only reason she was singled out was because of her 
weight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she can fit behind the wheel of her car even though she weighs 
450 pounds, almost 100 pounds more than Guy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of her not having enough room. She has to pull the seat 
closer than I do to drive," Williams said.

BENEATH THE GULF OF MAINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the yellow-hulled Delta slips below the surface in the Gulf of Maine 22 
miles off Massachusetts, bubbles form outside the portholes. The submersible 
craft enters a different world. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny, two-person sub dives to the sea floor, scattering fish as it skims 
the bottom noiselessly, moving through rocky canyons. This once-in-a-lifetime 
experience 200 feet underwater is part of high school program designed to bring 
the reality of the ocean and the environment up close. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be scared!" the pilot barks at a reporter as the sub hits the edge of a 
sharp ledge and bounces off, backwards, into a murky crevasse. "It sounds bad, 
but nothing's gonna break." 
</P>
<P>
As the sub meanders along the bottom, an unfamiliar realm slowly comes to life. 
Vivid pink and red stems of algae rise from the rough sand and flutter eerily, 
like long-stemmed roses. Ivory-colored sponges decorate the black, craggy 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Flounder swim lazily past the portholes. An enormous skate, lying flat on the 
bottom like a gray rug, heaves awake under sub's bright floodlights and circles 
the craft in apparent irritation. 
</P>
<P>
The High School Aquanaut program allows students and their teachers to 
participate in real undersea research in the waters off southern New England, 
the mid-Atlantic Bight and the Laurentian Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe what I was seeing," said Mary Wohlleber, 17, who will be a 
freshman at Eastern Connecticut State University next year. She has made two 
dives. "It makes you appreciate the ocean more. You're there doing the work 
firsthand, and until you do it firsthand you don't respect the animals or their 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The program is sponsored by the federally supported National Undersea 
Foundation at the University of Connecticut. The students are from southeastern 
Connecticut high schools, and there are plans to include inner-city students 
from New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no better way to get youngsters excited about the ocean and the 
environment than to make them diving scientists," Richard A. Cooper, director 
of the National Undersea Research Center, said. 
</P>
<P>
The course is safe, too. The Delta has made 1,969 dives without an accident. 
The sub is made of reinforced steel and is equipped with the same type of 
battery that powers a golf cart. It can go down 1,200 feet without pressurized 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the program, now in its third year, take part in research 
experiments. They are selected on a competitive basis from their schools, and 
plan their individual projects with their teachers and program coordinators 
before they go to sea. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the experience of a lifetime," 17-year-old Brad Martin said. "The 
views, the crew, being in a place that not many others are able to travel and 
explore. The program has been a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
In the so-called Pigeon Hill area at Jeffrey's Ledge off Gloucester, students 
help marine biologists measure the pollution content of scallops to determine 
the contamination of surface sediments. They set scallop cages and later 
retrieve them with the aid of the Delta's mechanical arm. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make them see that it takes only a short time to pollute the planet 
and several thousand years to reverse the process," said Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the scallop samples also have a larger significance, said Bill 
Robinson, a marine biologist with the New England Aquarium who is a program 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"We know more about corn in the Midwest than we do about fish in the ocean," he 
said. "That's why we can harvest corn so well. We don't know anything about 
scallops, but once we know about their reproduction cycles, it'll make all the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Richie Havens was aboard the research vessel J.W. Powell recently as it 
left Gloucester with a group of scientists and teachers to discover firsthand 
how the program works. 
</P>
<P>
Havens, 49, grew up in Brooklyn and works with underprivileged students in New 
York City. He helped to found the Northwind Undersea Institute for children on 
City Island in the Bronx. He also heads the Natural Guard, based in Washington, 
D.C., an environmental program for inner-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a city kid, and city kids need a place to go away from the concrete," 
said Havens, who said he will bring students into the program next year. "We're 
trying to raise their consciousness about their environment by showing them 
something they wouldn't otherwise see."

Hey, Prince Charles -- tired of that British climate? A politician is putting 
out the welcome mat in hopes that you or another member of the royal family 
will move Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
Legislator Bob Such told the South Australia state Parliament last week that 
Australia should consider having its own resident Royal Family. 
</P>
<P>
When asked who was on his royal short list, Such said one or more members of 
the British Royal Family could move Down Under to start Australia's own royal 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Such said the royals could become Australians eventually.

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I'm interested in investing in the stock market using no-load mutual funds. 
Is there a publication on the subject? I'd prefer one that gives a list of the 
best-performing no-load mutual funds and how to contact them. -- St. Louis, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
A: There are plenty of publications that keep track of the performance of 
no-load funds, which are those requiring no upfront fees. In most cases, they 
give addresses and phone numbers of the funds' managers. 
</P>
<P>
One is the "Mutual Fund Sourcebook," published by Morningstar Inc., 53 West 
Jackson St., Suite 460, Chicago, Ill., 60604. The cost is $60. Another is 
"Handbook for No-Load Fund Investors," published by No-Load Fund Investor, P.O. 
Box 283, Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, 10706. It costs $42. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating service, and Lipper Analytical Services, a 
New York-based research firm, put out "Mutual Fund Profiles." At $117, it 
contains reviews of the 1,000 largest stock and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two years ago, I purchased stock in Home Shopping Network at $8 a 
share. I am very disappointed since this stock seems to go nowhere, and the 
company is not paying a dividend. -- Allentown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
A: Home Shopping Network was the darling of the 1980s -- one of the stock 
market's impossible success stories. But after its initial success, it got too 
cocky and started expanding into fields in which it didn't have expertise: 
insurance, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at under $6 a share, Home Shopping Network's stock is cheaper than those 
cubic zirconium baubles sold on its cable TV shopping show. And a lot of 
investors are wondering why they bothered to invest in such a crazy upstart. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rosenberg of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. still keeps track of Home Shopping 
Network and likes the company. He recently told clients that weakness in the 
stock represented a buying opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg believes that the company could earn 38 cents a share in the fiscal 
year that ends this August and between 65 cents and 70 cents a share next year. 
That contrasts with a loss of 25 cents in 1989. With this improvement, 
Rosenberg thinks that Home Shopping Network's stock could rise to between $10 
and $12 a share in the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its current year, Rosenberg says, Home Shopping 
Network's sales rose 30%. 
</P>
<P>
There are only four analysts who officially follow Home Shopping Network. Their 
estimate of earnings for the current year recently ranged from 38 cents a share 
to 43 cents a share, according to the computer over at Institutional Brokers 
Estimate System. 
</P>
<P>
There is one potential problem, however. A Delaware judge last week ruled that 
the Home Shopping Network cheated some bondholders, and it may be forced to 
issue millions of shares of stock to them and pay millions in damages. That, of 
course, isn't good news for a company whose stock has been going backward. Home 
Shopping is expected to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We own shares of Fruit of the Loom. The stock seems to stay in the $13-$14 
range. Is this a good stock? -- Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
A: Lee Tawes of Oppenheimer &amp; Co is one of a few analysts who still follows 
Fruit of the Loom. And he likes the company. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the underwear industry is suffering its first slowdown in years, 
Tawes says Fruit of the Loom is such a low-cost producer it will continue to 
thrive. He recommends buying the stock and thinks that Fruit's sales will 
increase by a 15% to 20% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, also believes that 
longer-term prospects for the company are good. "As Fruit taps the 
international and domestic retail market with its activewear products, sales 
gains could average 13% over the next five years," Bronston recently told 
clients. She thinks that the stock could rise to $16 a share in the next 12 to 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
It was recently at about $12. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating service, doesn't share their optimism. As you 
may know, William Farley -- a Chicago takeover specialist -- has owned the 
biggest stake in Fruit of the Loom for some time. S&amp;P recently downgraded 
all of Farley Inc.'s debt, and did the same to Fruit's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Tawes, for one, believes that S&amp;P overreacted by including Fruit of the 
Loom in the downgrading. He thinks that the company will see its earnings rise 
to $1.70 a share this year (from $1.11 last year). 
</P>
<P>
This past week, Farley executed a complicated agreement under which he sold his 
Fruit of the Loom stock to a company called Land Free Investment Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My aunt passed away and I found a lot of stock certificates. Could you tell 
me if they are worth anything? -- California City 
</P>
<P>
A: Here's the status of all your aunt's stocks, thanks to the investigative 
work of R. M. Smythe, a New York City company that specializes in tracking down 
obscure securities. La Merced Oil Co. forfeited its charter to do business in 
California in 1925. Revere Oil Co. was shut down by U.S. Postal authorities in 
the 1920s. It was running some sort of scam. 
</P>
<P>
The copy of the stock certificate you sent me for Clinton Consolidated Mining 
says the company was incorporated in Arizona. Smythe couldn't find any record 
of it in that state, but it did find a company by the same name in Cripple 
Creek, Colo. That company, too, is worthless. 
</P>
<P>
And, lastly, Arcadia Oil Co., which was located in San Diego, went belly up 
during Calvin Coolidge's administration. JOHN CRUDELE

COLUMNIST FAILS TO SEE THE NEED FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE WHEN IT COMES TO OIL 
SUPPLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't believe that James Flanigan really expects us to accept him as a 
serious, responsible international economist from the theme of his article 
"OPEC Is Cause for Worry but Not Panic" (Aug. 1). 
</P>
<P>
Is Flanigan's memory so short that he doesn't remember the long lines and the 
terrible employment, economic and social problems caused by the last oil 
embargo imposed by the Arab oil-producing states? And this was when we were 
importing far less of our oil than the 50% we do now! Even Flanigan recognizes 
that "the U.S. will end up importing 60% of its oil by the mid-1990s." 
</P>
<P>
It's bad enough for fuel prices to jump up but much more dangerous to the 
United States is our dependency on Arab oil to run our nation's economy and its 
defenses. The United States has put itself in a foolish position for Arab 
blackmail. What if our oil supply is cut off completely? What options then? 
</P>
<P>
From the way the Arab states treat each other, let alone foreigners, it's 
obvious that an appeal to humanitarianism has no effect -- all that influences 
them is political and economic power. Look at the horrible Iraq-Iran war and 
the present invasion of defenseless Kuwait by massive Iraqi forces. 
</P>
<P>
If Flanigan can't see the need for U.S. independence when it comes to energy 
supplies, I don't know how he expects his views to be taken seriously.

FORD PRICING STRATEGY USES CONVOLUTED LOGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two items in your July 25 "Briefly" column really stood out: (1) Domestic car 
and truck sales off, with Ford dropping 18.8%, the most of all; and (2) Ford 
Motor Co. said the average price of one of its 1991 cars will be $528, or 3.2% 
higher, and the average light truck price will increase by 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
How they figure that raising prices will increase sales is mystifying. I can 
only assume that they use the same convoluted logic that the state Lottery used 
when deciding that decreasing the odds of winning by adding more numbers would 
increase revenue.

AGRICULTURAL LAND IN STATE MUST BE SAVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Aug. 5th's "Cash Crop or Cash Out," California's agricultural land 
should be saved despite the objections of farmers and land developers. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound radical, but the only way this may be accomplished is to have a 
statewide comprehensive growth management plan, which would save agricultural 
resoures, preserve open space and prevent urban sprawl with all its related 
traffic congestion and environmental pollution. 
</P>
<P>
I for one would be willing to pay extra taxes to implement such a plan. I think 
that most Californians would do the same because we know this state is a 
special place and we must take the initiative to keep it that way.

<P>
The crisis over Kuwait marks a watershed for the Bush Administration. Success 
will boost world morale and the world economy. It will strengthen the 
President's domestic leadership. Failure will blight all future domestic and 
international efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, so far, has risen to the challenge with subtlety, skill and 
fortitude. But the game has only begun. The President's dramatic decision to 
deploy a major military force in Saudi Arabia has raised not only the prospects 
of success but also the stakes of defeat. The United States has passed the 
point of no return. 
</P>
<P>
It is thus crucial to assess how success and failure are to be defined. The 
U.N. Security Council has unanimously demanded the unconditional withdrawal of 
Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of the legitimate government. The 
United States has justified its interdiction of the sea lanes as a response to 
a request of the exiled Kuwaiti government. 
</P>
<P>
Should Iraq manage to remain in Kuwait or exercise indirect control through 
some puppet, the American show of force will turn into a debacle. If in the end 
Iraq controls Kuwait and U.S. forces stay in Saudi Arabia, the crisis will have 
ended in a demonstration of the irrelevance of America and of world opinion. In 
any event, neither Arab nor U.S. politics would long sustain significant troop 
deployments in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The argument that we have saved Saudi Arabia will be overwhelmed by the 
perception of an American failure that would shake political, economic and 
financial stability everywhere. Indeed, even attainment of the U.N. objectives 
might provide only a breathing space if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein remains 
in office and he continues to build up its nuclear and chemical weapons 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
Time is not on our side. If after a certain interval the conflict appears to 
settle down to a siege, the United States will be obliged to consider new 
measures to bring it to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had three choices in dealing with the crisis: It could 
passively endorse whatever consensus emerged in the United Nations; it could 
support whatever the industrial democracies -- all of which are more dependent 
on Mideast oil than the United States is -- were prepared to do in concert; or 
it could take the lead in opposing Hussein and try to organize international 
support for an effort in which the United States would bear the principal 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
There were ample excuses for avoiding a decision. The most fashionable argument 
was that the area's defense should be an Arab matter. But none of the Arab 
states is strong enough, even in combination, to defeat the Iraqi army. In any 
case, such an argument marks the re-emergence of American isolationism, 
especially among the conservatives. Allowed to prevail, it would conclude with 
America's abdication at the moment when the old East-West conflict has been 
won. 
</P>
<P>
Another excuse was that even if Iraq controlled all the oil in the gulf, it 
would still have to sell it in a world market governed by the laws of supply 
and demand. But were Iraq to achieve its strategic design, it would be able to 
determine the level of supply by taking production away from sparsely populated 
principalities in the Arabian Peninsula without hurting its own population. The 
ability to cause a worldwide economic crisis is not the sort of power to be 
left in the hands of a ruler who has attacked three of his six neighbors, is 
engaged in mortal conflict with two others and has used poison gas against his 
own dissident population. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration must have concluded that the first two options would almost 
certainly have ended with making Iraqi domination of Kuwait permanent. That 
would produce the collapse of the moderate governments in the region, including 
Egypt. Ultimately, a general Middle East war would have been probable. 
</P>
<P>
Having committed the United States to a leadership role, President Bush made 
another crucial decision: He and his advisers opted for a massive deployment. 
In so doing, they seem to have reasoned that the United Nations' unexpected 
sanctions might change Hussein's calculation. He may well not have originally 
intended to seize the Saudi oil fields. Had there been no meaningful 
resistance, he would not have needed to do so. The rulers of the Arabian 
peninsula -- in Saudi Arabia as well as in the emirates -- would have yielded 
to Iraqi pressures or been overthrown, more likely both. 
</P>
<P>
But once the sanctions were voted, Hussein's calculus was bound to change. So 
long as oil prices remain steady, the sanctions are likely to be sustained. And 
prices will remain at more or less present levels if Saudi Arabia increases its 
production by 2.5 million barrels. But if Saudi production can be destroyed or 
even severely reduced, the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil -- roughly 4.6 
million barrels -- will lead to an explosive rise in oil prices. With a 
worldwide depression looming, it would become increasingly difficult to 
maintain sanctions. Hussein would win the endurance contest. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and his advisers must have concluded that once they committed 
military forces, the best hope of ending the crisis quickly was to assemble an 
overwhelming force to overawe such a threat and to be able to go further if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
There is now widespread public support. The United Nations is nearly unanimous. 
NATO countries have sent naval and air contingents. An Arab multinational force 
is in place. The test, however, will not be the extent of the support but its 
durability. For that reason, this is a time for the Administration to calculate 
the window of opportunity it has available to achieve its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration must take care not to wallow in the domestic and 
international support it now enjoys. Public concern about the probability of 
success, coupled with insistent reassurances by Administration spokesmen, will, 
over time, weaken the credibility of the American enterprise. At some point, 
the familiar question of the light at the end of the tunnel is bound to 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
The situation within the Middle East is also likely to grow more precarious the 
longer the crisis festers. The impact on the Arab world of anti-Western 
propaganda from Baghdad and the skillful linking of Kuwait and Palestine must 
not be underestimated. The region is now polarized as never before; radicalism 
is on the rise. A coup in one of the emirates or sabotage in the oil fields 
would send another shock through the region. It would upset the already 
precarious balance between supply and demand in the world oil markets, driving 
up oil prices, causing unemployment and inflation and risking the solidarity 
backing the sanctions. The refusal of France to permit its navy to participate 
in the sea interdiction may be a foretaste. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the time required for the sanctions to work must be balanced against the 
factors undermining international cohesion. The acid test of the sanctions will 
be not how much oil is prevented from leaving the region but how few supplies 
are allowed to enter Iraq. Iraqi oil exports are relatively easily blocked. But 
Iraq's frontiers are long and less bulky goods -- food -- can seep in. And the 
likelihood of this happening will grow the longer the crisis lasts and the more 
Iraq's neighbors conclude that they may have to live with the Iraqi dictator, 
however dangerous he may be. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know whether sanctions can work within the time constraints outlined 
here. I also realize that the United States must consider the risk that a more 
aggressive course might take away some of the current international support. At 
the same time, that support would not survive the appearance of an American 
defeat. The United States stands to lose the most from a long siege -- whatever 
the relative immediate economic impact on Europe and Japan. An ignominious 
withdrawal following the debacle in Lebanon -- and any withdrawal however 
dressed up without achieving our objectives would be ignominious -- would end 
America's stabilizing role in the Middle East. And no other country could take 
its place. It would also undermine the single most important asset left in 
America's relations with Europe and Japan -- America's contribution to the 
security of its allies. It would gravely weaken the Bush Administration's 
capacity to overcome the economic crisis that would follow. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake to focus only on America's difficulties. In the end, Iraq 
is a heavily indebted developing country with a population of only 16 million 
that has just ended a debilitating 10-year war with Iran, and which has hostile 
relations with four of its six neighbors. It is in no position to enter into a 
protracted conflict with the United States. Saddam Hussein proved during the 
Iran war that he is prepared to negotiate when necessary. His most recent offer 
agreed to the principle of withdrawal from Kuwait, albeit under outrageous 
conditions. It may be the beginning of an attempt at negotiation obscured by 
bluster once the reality of the stark choices before Iraq sinks in. Then the 
offer to withdraw may reemerge stripped of its absurd baggage. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States cannot afford to be diddled; it simply cannot afford to 
lose. If sanctions prove too uncertain and diplomacy unavailing, the United 
States will need to consider a surgical and progressive destruction of Iraq's 
military assets -- especially since an outcome that leaves Hussein in place and 
his military machine unimpaired might turn out to be only an interlude between 
aggressions. 
</P>
<P>
It would be irresponsible for an outsider to press for a course of action in a 
situation so dependent on information not available to the kibitzer. But it is 
important to understand that America has crossed its Rubicon. All those 
concerned with global peace and world economic well-being should subordinate 
whatever tactical misgivings they may have to standing behind the only policy 
that can now succeed.

"He who stands too close to the blacksmith gets burned by the sparks," Kuwait's 
foreign minister once said of his country's location between warring Iran and 
Iraq. Kuwait lived by oil, a most flammable substance. This month, Saddam 
Hussein set a fire that burned independent Kuwait to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was a most unusual country, more state of mind -- or finance -- than 
nation-state. Lacking a national tradition, its citizens were bound together 
largely by a combination of their traditional way of life and the new riches 
they shared. Lacking any means to defend itself against powerful neighbors Iran 
and Iraq, Kuwait tried to pursue a systematic policy of appeasement. 
</P>
<P>
The Al Sabah family ruled the desert that became Kuwait when the United States 
was still a British colony. To escape from its neighbors' domination, the 
rulers accepted a British protectorate themselves in 1899. Although Baghdad 
recognized the border in 1932, the 1960s and again in 1976, it periodically 
claimed Kuwait for itself, coveting Kuwait's oil wealth and 120 miles of 
Persian Gulf shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after London granted independence in 1961, Iraqi threats forced British 
troops to return for a few months. Then, in an interesting precedent, the 
British were replaced by an Arab League force from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia 
and Sudan, which stayed two years until the danger dissipated. Every time 
Kuwait seemed vulnerable -- when the British terminated their security 
guarantee in 1971, in 1973 and again in 1976 when the emir dissolved Parliament 
-- Iraq reiterated its claim. 
</P>
<P>
When Iraq's threat receded, Islamic Iran began to press its own claim, trying 
to subvert the 20% of Kuwaiti citizens who shared Tehran's denomination of 
Shiite Islam. Most of the Iran-Iraq War, particularly between 1982 and 1988, 
was fought a few miles from Kuwait's frontier. Angered by Kuwait's support for 
Iraq, Iran sponsored dozens of acts of sabotage and terrorism in the first half 
of the 1980s, including a 1985 assassination attempt on the emir. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait sold oil on Iraq's behalf, gave tens of billions of dollars in loans 
that were actually gifts and used its ports to transship Iraqi war supplies. 
When Iran escalated attacks on Kuwaiti ships, the government asked to 
re-register tankers under the U.S. flag so they could be convoyed by U.S. 
warships. The United States agreed and lived up to its promise. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Kuwait had always been the most outspokenly anti-American of all 
the gulf Arab regimes. Part of Kuwait's appeasement was to buy off potential 
attacks or subversion by subsidizing Iraq, Syria and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. The other component was rhetorical extremism. Kuwait was not 
moderate; it simply did not do very much except talk and donate money. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Kuwait's U.N. ambassador could speak of a "cabal which controls and 
manipulates and exploits the rest of humanity by controlling the money and 
wealth of the world. . . . It is a well-known fact that the Zionists are the 
richest people in the world and control much of its destiny." In July, 1985, 
Kuwait National Assembly speaker Ahmad al Sa'dun demanded Kuwait cease aid to 
the PLO and Jordan for being too moderate in considering negotiations with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, despite some regional defense efforts -- the Gulf 
Cooperation Council pact of those unable to protect themselves; the trade of 
aid for Egyptian advisers in 1986 -- Kuwait's survival depended ultimately on 
Western support. Yet Kuwaitis correctly believed that they could bad-mouth the 
West and enjoy its help. Thus, for example, they threatened to go to the 
Soviets to obtain American reflagging, then gave the U.S. fleet only limited 
help in protecting them. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably obsessed with their vulnerability, Kuwait based its internal 
politics on three principles: limit citizenship, keep power away from radical 
nationalists and get as much money as possible out of the country.

The emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, continued paternalist tribal 
traditions. The royal family's hundreds of members held the key offices; its 
700,000 citizens, those descended from families living there before the 
mid-1920s, received an average annual income higher than that of Americans. A 
typical Kuwaiti scheme was the 75-member consultative assembly (one-third 
appointed by the emir), elected in June for a two-year term. There were also 
1.2 million non-citizens in Kuwait, more than 300,000 of them Palestinians, who 
made a great deal of money but had no political standing. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than build industry at home, the expectation of invasion or domestic 
instability made Kuwait send its money abroad, preparing for a day when its 
people might join their cash in exile. There is now about $50 billion in the 
United States, $30 billion in Europe (mostly England), and $20 billion 
elsewhere. This money is divided between the Reserve Fund for Future 
Generations, which cannot be touched until early in the next century, and a 
more liquid General Reserve. Private investment around the world may total $50 
to $75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait favored moderate oil prices not because it was a Western lackey but 
because it did not want to frighten customers into conservation or to diversify 
fuels and sources of supply. Kuwaitis had a stake in Western economic stability 
because they held shares in so many foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Kuwait survived for almost three decades on a mixture of rational 
calculation and paying protection money. It did not expect to be loved by the 
Arab World, it did hope to be left alone. To ensure itself, Kuwait gave 
generous aid and mouthed the Arab world's standard lines about Arab brotherhood 
and the United States being the region's No. 1 enemy. The appeasement which 
sustained Kuwait also left it defenseless when Hussein would no longer be 
satisfied with a large, reliable supply of golden eggs and decided to kill the 
goose which laid them.

IN ARAB VIEW, IT'S NOT JUST KUWAIT BUT BUSH'S ENMITY TOWARD HUSSEIN;

GULF CRISIS: KUWAIT PRODUCES SOME UNUSUAL ARAB WORLD ALLIANCES, AMID 
INDICATIONS THAT THE ARAB-WEST SPLIT WILL BECOME EVEN MORE ANTAGONISTIC.

It will be many days yet before anyone can project the consequences of the 
U.S.-Iraq crisis. But the event has had such a shock effect that even now we 
may hazard guesses about the post-Kuwait Arab World. 
</P>
<P>
That world, more than ever fragmented by the pressures of the current crisis, 
is rightly or wrongly united on one point -- that the cause of the crisis is 
not just Kuwait but the passion of George Bush to be rid of Saddam Hussein. 
There is today more pure, unalloyed hatred of the United States among Arabs 
than at any time in the 30 years that this correspondent has been reporting on 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the past fortnight it has become a cliche to say that "things are never 
going to be the same again" in the Middle East, for it was already recognized, 
before any bullets started flying, that this crisis would have consequences 
wider and deeper than those of Suez. In the next few years the division between 
the Arabs and the West is going to be still more angry and antagonistic, 
perhaps partly because in many countries there is an internal split between the 
rulers and the ruled. The pro-Western rulers uphold international law but the 
ruled say that if Iraq committed aggression it was doing the "right" thing in 
getting rid of a non-representative monarchical regime, but in the wrong way -- 
that the ruling Al Sabah family should have been thrown out by the Kuwaiti 
people. 
</P>
<P>
This unfeeling indifference to the fall of the house of Al Sabah is an 
expression of a surprising degree of hostility, now openly expressed, between 
the "Gulfis" and the other Arabs: In sartorial terms, between the men of the 
safari jacket and the men of the nightshirts. In the view of the former, the 
gulf system of monarchical states is one of the principal things that is never 
going to be the same again. If one of these states -- the most "advanced" and 
decent and liberal -- can be swept aside, then all the others can be 
challenged: From now on they are living on borrowed time. If the Al Sabah 
family is restored, it would quite soon have to yield its absolute power to an 
elected parliament or face people-power. 
</P>
<P>
The interstate systems of the Arab World have been tested and found wanting. 
The Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab Cooperation Council have been unable 
to do anything positive. Surprisingly, the Arab League has gained some credit 
because it did pass a resolution that took a stand -- but at the price of 
setting aside the provision of its charter that all important decisions should 
be unanimous. After this precedent, no future decisions of the league are ever 
going to be unanimous, because the Kuwait crisis has forced governments to 
stand up and be counted with some strange results: Moderate pro-Western Tunisia 
turned out to be an angry radical, which was also more or less true of the 
United Yemens and Somalia, while professionally anti-Western Syria aligned 
itself with Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the gulf emirates, the regimes that are going to be the most 
vulnerable because of their policy in the crisis are Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
Despite the extra security provisions that have been taken in Egypt, there was 
the extraordinary spectacle of Egyptians lining up in front of the Iraqi 
Embassy in Cairo to volunteer for service with Iraq and, therefore, possibly 
against the Egyptian contingent defending Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi claim to be the custodian of Islam's Holy Places has been demolished 
because that government brought into the Holy Land thousands of the men of the 
cross, the neo-Christian Crusaders. They are led, at this moment, by George 
Bush, on holiday in Maine. It is because of this fanatical aspect that the 
eventual gainers from the current situation, apart from Israel, will be Islamic 
fundamentalists everywhere, not least in Saudi Arabia and not just in the Arab 
World. 
</P>
<P>
The current coalition between the secular Arab nationalists and fundamentalists 
is as powerful as it is unprecedented, because hitherto the fundamentalists 
have backed the conservative, pro-Western regimes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this imposed shift in opinion, the leadership of Yasser Arafat 
within the Palestine Liberation Organization, seriously questioned and even 
challenged, has been strengthened by his pro-Iraqi stand. And this internal 
cohesion largely makes up for the loss of the PLO's Saudi paymasters and its 
loss of credibility in the West. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Iraq? Iraq means Saddam Hussein. As of now he is in a no-lose 
situation. If he "wins," in whatever fashion, he will emerge as a greater Arab 
hero even than Gamal Abdel Nasser -- almost as great as Saladin, the 
12th-Century sultan of Egypt and Syria who, like Hussein, was also a native of 
Tikrit on the Tigris. If he loses he will be a martyr, because he will not fail 
by stepping down, resigning or going into voluntary exile. He will have to be 
killed, either in an internal coup or by military action. The manner of his 
death will decide his place in Iraqi history. 
</P>
<P>
What can be safely predicted is that his death will be followed by a civil war, 
a struggle for power between the armed militia of the Baath Party and the 
regular army. The party and Hussein personally have never trusted the soldiers 
-- which is why there have been frequent purges of the senior ranks. The latest 
attempt against Hussein was in early June and was reportedly financed by 
Kuwait's Al Sabah family, which could explain why Hussein is so determined they 
should not return. On the day of the attack into Kuwait, the army and the civil 
administration of Iraq were brought under the direct control of the Baath 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
In a shoot-out, the army should have the firepower to defeat the party, 
provided the generals act together. If a general or a cabal of generals come 
out on top, they will retain the essentials of Hussein's policy because these 
are popular in Iraq -- Arab nationalist opposition to Israel, a mixed economy, 
a more relaxed policy on human rights and a greater concentration on internal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Israel and the Islamic fundamentalists -- indeed as one of the 
fundamentalists -- Iran could emerge as one of the beneficiaries of the crisis. 
It has already benefited from Hussein's concessions, made under U.S. military 
pressure, on the shared control of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway and the exchange 
of territory with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the moderates in Iran want friendship with the West, and Iran has 
condemned Iraq for invading Kuwait, the supporters of the "imam's line" in 
Tehran are still strong enough to declare that monarchies are anti-Islamic and 
that Western military power, especially that of the United States, must be 
removed from the gulf. If Iran maintains that firm line, while at the same time 
breaking sanctions to help Iraq with food imports, which has been hinted at, 
then Iran would get the best of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, traditionally moderate and pro-Western, now seems to be facing an 
excruciating situation, allied to the bete noire of the West and threatened by 
the West with economic ruin and starvation. Yet the bases of King Hussein's 
power, internally, are solid. The population, both Jordanian and Palestinian, 
is completely with him, not forgetting the newly emerged power of the 
fundamentalists; the army's loyalty is solid. So he does not really have to 
face any political dangers -- only economic hardship and deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to discern the future, one sees the Middle East, however the Kuwait 
crisis is settled, as a miserable and nasty place. The economies of many 
countries will be either badly damaged or ruined -- Sudan, Egypt, Lebanon, 
Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait and even those gulf states not directly involved, because 
if the foreign workers there, essential for keeping their economies and 
administrations going, take fright and run for home, daily life will grind to a 
halt. The countries with injured economies will be looking for compensation, 
and so a two-tiered protectorate system will come into existence. 
</P>
<P>
At the lower, financial level, Kuwait will pay Turkey, Saudi Arabia will 
continue subsidizing Morocco and Syria and the United States will go on paying 
Egypt. And at a higher level, the moneybags themselves will be under the 
politico-military protection of the United States. The peoples of the area will 
be either vengefully cocky -- if Iraq prevails -- or resentfully sullen -- if 
it does not. And whatever happens, the Middle East peace process will be far 
over the horizon.

USE NEUTRON BOMB ON THE IRAQIS?; 
</P>
<P>
WAR: RATHER THAN GET BOGGED DOWN IN ANOTHER INCONCLUSIVE CONVENTIONAL WAR, U.S. 
SHOULD CONSIDER A MORE DISCRIMINATING AND EFFECTIVE WEAPON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Cohen, Sam Cohen, a retired nuclear analyst, invented the neutron bomb. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since World War II, the United States has been involved in two major 
conventional wars in Asia, both of politically and economically disastrous. 
Thus the wisdom of getting involved in another in the Middle East is open to 
serious question. Were this to happen, President Bush, as was the case with 
Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (Vietnam) and Harry S. Truman (Korea), might be 
prematurely retired by a disgruntled American electorate, leaving behind an 
economy badly battered by a costly conventional war. This need not happen if 
the United States were to base its strategy for war with Iraq on the neutron 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
When the neutron-bomb concept was devised in 1958, its possible use in NATO 
defenses was not uppermost in defense-planners' minds. Rather, the bomb was 
envisioned as a weapon for use in Asian ground wars, where any potential 
opponent lacked a nuclear-response capability. In such circumstances, the 
neutron bomb, which uses an instantaneous burst of nuclear radiation to 
incapacitate enemy personnel without destructive blast and heat effects, 
represented an extremely potent battlefield weapon. It is vastly more effective 
and far more discriminating than conventional weapons. And it would enable a 
quick military victory at a far smaller cost in American lives and national 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
This possibility led to the highest priority being assigned to the development 
of the weapon. In the early 1960s, a series of successful tests at the nuclear 
test site in Nevada were conducted. Subsequently, it was proposed that neutron 
weapons be produced and stockpiled. But the proposal was rejected out of hand 
by the Defense Department. Meantime, the United States entered into and 
suffered the consequences of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to the possibility of a major ground war with Iraq. For the 
precise reasons -- battlefield effectiveness at minium cost to U.S. lives and 
treasure -- that led to its development, the neutron bomb's time may be at 
hand. Bush might wish to include it as a military option before he commits even 
more ground forces to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ordered the stockpiling of neutron weapons, 
including hundreds of artillery shells that could be delivered by eight-inch 
cannons. Because of West Germany's refusal to accept these weapons, they were 
stored in sites in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Today these artillery shells would be ideally suited for use against Iraq's 
armored forces. Such a capability could be achieved by deploying artillery 
units with nuclear-trained crews to Saudi Arabia. These units are capable of 
firing conventional rounds as well as nuclear. Delivery of the neutron shells 
to Saudi Arabia could occur within a day's time, if the President so ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Such a deployment, should it take place, must be announced openly, to send a 
clear message to Iraq about the seriousness of U.S. intentions. What's 
important is that the threat of such use could deter an attack from occurring. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, civilized nations would bitterly condemn the United States for again 
turning to nuclear weapons, in this case, the neutron bomb. But perhaps these 
nations should contemplate the economic chaos and social misery that could 
result from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein dominating the world's oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from world opinion, however, there is a far more important issue for the 
United States to weigh -- how to balance its choice of weapons to win a war 
quickly versus the domestic political and economic consequences of fighting a 
war that goes on interminably and inconclusively. An already strained American 
economy might not hold up well under another large, protracted conventional 
ground war. Thus the United States might want to come down on the nuclear side 
-- in favor of the neutron bomb.

WATTS, 25 YEARS POST-REBELLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their articles on Watts (Opinion, Aug. 5) Conot and Robert M. Taylor Jr. see 
Watts after 25 years as essentially the same: A place where nothing much has 
changed, a place where fear and despair are still found. 
</P>
<P>
Watts is a symbol of all those areas in large cities where the poor grind out 
their desolate lives in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The child who is born poor has the odds stacked against him. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest threat to this country is not Marxism or Cuba or Iran. It is the 
desolation of the poor. We must start with the poor and pregnant woman. We must 
give her all the care she needs so that she can give birth to a normal, healthy 
child. Then we must enroll that child in pre-Head Start and Head Start 
programs, and when he finishes there, send him on to non-segregated, quality 
schools. Encourage him to go as far as he can in his schooling. Then he can 
enter that competitive world confident that he can break the cycle of poverty. 
Then Watts will carry a different symbol, a symbol of hope.

WATTS, 25 YEARS POST-REBELLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "A Quarter-Century of Slipping Backward" (Commentary, Aug. 10) Profs. Melvin 
Oliver, Walter Farrell and James Johnson sing an all-too-familiar refrain 
regarding the plight of African Americans in the Watts area. 
</P>
<P>
It is a song which many African American leaders chant not only about Watts but 
also about similar areas in the nation. The main lyric is: "Let's blame all of 
our problems on someone else." 
</P>
<P>
It is the fostering of that attitude which, along with real and alleged 
discrimination, establishes the foundation for the retardation of social and 
economic progress in Watts and similar areas. 
</P>
<P>
A destructive climate is created by many in the black leadership who, like the 
professors who authored the article, look outward to fix blame rather than 
inward for the formulation of constructive and creative self-help solutions.

WATTS, 25 YEARS POST-REBELLION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hair raises on the back of my neck every time I come across a comment like 
Robert Conot's ("Watts: Out of the Fire" Opinion, Aug. 5) that the cause of the 
"increasing disparity" between black and white people's income is because black 
students "have not been receiving" the education necessary for them to get 
well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Here it goes again, I shudder at this point, another of the common diatribes 
against supposedly racist white teachers who deliberately prevent black 
students from getting the education they need for future financial success. 
</P>
<P>
What an immense restorative it was to read Conot's unusual yet correct 
assessment of the problem of scholastic underachievement among blacks: "Schools 
are one-half the equation. Home is the other." 
</P>
<P>
Educators accept the vital need, for example, of early education programs for 
black children like Head Start, and for making schoolwork interesting and 
meaningful for them. It is now time for black leaders to begin to do what is 
necessary to put a stop to the plague of pregnancies outside of marriage in 
their communities. As Conot rightly warns, only if these pregnancies are 
prevented can added expenditures for the education of black children have their 
intended effect.

OIL SPILL BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political infighting and opposition from the oil industry are choking prospects 
for a comprehensive oil-spill prevention and cleanup bill in our state capitol. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo) has crafted an excellent bill (AB 
2603) to prevent oil spills, provide tougher fines for polluters, and fund 
clean-up operations along our coast in the case of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
But his proposal is hung up in the state Senate, where senators refuse to 
support AB 2603 because they have already voted on an oil spill bill written by 
Senate leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia). 
</P>
<P>
Keene's bill, SB 2040, is good, but does not provide enough prevention 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
The state Legislature should combine the Keene and Lempert measures into a 
comprehensive and strong oil spill bill. Unless citizens act now, the oil 
lobbyists may succeed in killing the efforts of Assemblyman Lempert to truly 
protect our coast from oil spills.

TWO ANTI-CIGARETTE DECISIONS MAKE A MOCKERY OF FAIR PLAY.

<P>
Last month, the New Jersey Supreme Court joined California lawmakers in cutting 
its legal conscience to fit contemporary anti-cigarette fashions. In Dewey vs. 
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co., New Jersey's highest tribunal held that 
cigarette companies could be answerable in damages under state law based on 
health warnings that satisfied federal law and on the defective design of 
cigarettes. In 1989, California inaugurated a broadcast crusade against tobacco 
manufacturers portraying their executives and smokers as morally akin to Saddam 
Hussein. Both demarches illustrate mob justice and undermine the arch of 
civilized government. 
</P>
<P>
The Dewey case displayed judicial prejudice at its worst. Wilfred Dewey smoked 
cigarettes for four decades before his 1980 death stemming from lung cancer. 
His smoking continued after legions of federal trumpeters had sounded clarion 
calls of warning. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, the U.S. surgeon general issued a much ballyhooed report finding 
correlations between smoking and lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, 
cardiovascular disease and cancer of the larynx. The following year, Congress 
enacted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. 
</P>
<P>
It required cigarette packages to warn that: "The Surgeon General Has 
Determined That Cigarette Smoking May Be Dangerous To Your Health." In 1970, 
the warning was made more definitive. The Federal Trade Commission issued 
companion rules regulating cigarette advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these unambiguous and omnipresent health warnings, Dewey chose to smoke 
in lieu of a more puritanical existence. He never protested that the pleasures 
he derived from cigarettes were not worth their health risks, and thus lacked 
any legitimate cause for complaint. 
</P>
<P>
His widow, nevertheless, sued tobacco companies for damages on behalf of 
herself and her husband's estate. Resting on state tort law, the complaint 
charged the defendants with negligence in failing to adequately warn smokers of 
health hazards, and with strict liability for defectively designing cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first claim, the New Jersey Supreme Court parted company with 
contrary holdings by five federal appellate courts and its sister state court 
in Minnesota. This galaxy of wisdom had concluded that the federal Cigarette 
Act preempted state law damage claims based on inadequate warnings. 
</P>
<P>
The express purposes of the federal law fortify these holdings: adequate 
cigarette health warnings and preservation of national cigarette markets. The 
first postulates that compliance with federal warning rules are adequate to 
inform the public. It is at war with any state rule authorizing damages by 
second-guessing of warning adequacy. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it ignores commercial reality to insist that the second purpose would 
be undisturbed by acrophobic state liability risks based on inadequate 
labeling. They would compel tobacco manufacturers to atomize and tailor sales 
and promotions to fit disparate state tort laws. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Supreme Court, nevertheless, held that cigarette companies could 
be liable for damages by failing to volunteer more warnings than federal law 
stipulated. It also concluded that state law would make cigarette companies 
liable for injuries caused by smoking if a jury determines that a different 
cigarette design might have reduced health risks without impairing consumer 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
But a design defect claim is a euphemism for vigilante justice. How do tobacco 
companies prove the utility of smoking? Do they call smokers to testify to the 
sensual, psychological or emotional benefits derived from cigarettes? How does 
a jury assign them a dollar value? Is the average utility to smokers the 
pertinent calculation, or the utility to deceased smokers whose deaths 
precipitated the lawsuits? How do manufacturers prove that altering the 
ingredients of cigarettes to reduce health risks would reduce consumer 
pleasures? Must they conduct expensive marketing experiments and user surveys? 
Must they prove that different ingredients would cause a substantial profit 
loss? 
</P>
<P>
These questions corroborate that the Dewey ruling empowers juries to hold 
manufacturers liable for defective cigarette design by whim or enmity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, California levied a 25-cent cigarette tax to fund a frenzied broadcast 
campaign against tobacco companies. The state-subsidized polemics mock 
elemental fairness and First Amendment principles because U.S. law prohibits 
cigarette companies from responding on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine justice requires evenhanded protection of both the honorable and the 
hated. Anti-cigarette laws in New Jersey and California flunk the test.

USE MIGHT IN SERVICE OF RIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH HAS DONE THE CORRECT THING IN THE GULF. BUT HE'S WEAKENED BY AMERICA'S 
INCONSISTENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson is a syndicated columnist in 
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the world of so-called Realpolitik, the law is the Golden Rule -- that is, 
he who has the gold, rules. In key countries of the Middle East, the color of 
gold is black. The black gold referred to is oil. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein illegally invaded Kuwait (and 
intended to invade Saudi Arabia) to gain control of up to 45% of the world's 
oil reserves. With control of such a vital raw material, the destiny of modern 
industrial states would be largely in his hands. By manipulating the price and 
availability of oil, he could accrue great wealth and power and maintain a 
death grip on the world's economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, the United States used its economic and military might to 
maneuver in the world community -- the U.N. Security Council, the Arab League, 
our NATO allies and Japan -- to isolate Iraq. The big kid on the block 
justified his actions in the name of national security and world stability. 
Realpolitik's Golden Rule seems to be operative on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Our national interest will be served and the chances for world stability 
enhanced to the degree that we fight for human rights measured by these 
yardsticks: fight for everyone's right to self-determination; fight to 
strengthen and increase the rule of international law; contribute to the 
development of underdeveloped nations, and fight for a fairer distribution of 
the world's resources, income and wealth, applying these principles 
consistently everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's actions to date have been prudent, skillful and in proportion. In other 
words, he has fundamentally been right. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, might may be used as a deterrent from aggression, but 
right must be the justification for acting. Bush is weakened by inconsistency 
in the application of these principles. 
</P>
<P>
The moral authority of the United States was weakened when we illegally mined 
the harbors in Nicaragua. When the World Court found us guilty of violating 
international law, we ignored its verdict. By contrast, we later wanted to use 
the World Court's decision against Iran in the Persian Gulf crisis. In other 
words, the issue was not international law and right, but might. 
</P>
<P>
When we locked out the press, paid off allies in the region to "invite" us into 
Grenada and illegally invaded a tiny island nation of 110,000 people without a 
standing army -- using the excuse that American students were at risk and 
Cubans were building an airport to be used as a Soviet military base -- we were 
operating on the principle of might, not right. 
</P>
<P>
We used the same fundamental principle in Panama, even though the situation was 
complicated and clouded by U.S.-financed elections that were ignored by Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega. That still did not give us the right to violate the native 
Panamanians' drive for self-determination. We sacrificed the lives of two dozen 
Americans and countless Panamanians in the process. And the Panamanians are 
still suffering because we have not paid them for the destruction of our 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein was wrong when he violated Kuwait's right to self-determination and 
broke international law by invading a sovereign country. He is right, however, 
and gets a strong hearing in the Arab world, when he says that Israel and Syria 
are wrong for invading and occupying Lebanon, and that Israel is wrong for 
occupying the West Bank and Gaza and denying Palestinians their human rights 
and self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia should not ignore the message (even though the 
messenger may be flawed) from many of their fellow Arabs about the grave 
disparity between the rich Persian Gulf states and the masses of poor in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Neither should they ignore the structures of their own societies. Much of the 
democratic industrialized world came to their rescue with mixed emotions. They 
came because they needed to protect the oil for their own interests. But they 
were also keenly aware that they were propping up a feudal society in which the 
rights of the common people and women are less than others, and other freedoms 
(of the press, for one) are denied. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should practice the democratic principles it preaches, even 
as it backs them up with economic and military strength. Then, when we must 
act, we will have the moral authority to gain the backing of the world 
community because we are right, and not just because we have might.

CONTROVERSY BEDEVILS TEACHING OF HISTORY IN BRITAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
British students learn all about Florence Nightingale, the heroic nurse of the 
Crimean battlefields, but what of Mary Seacole, a Jamaican nurse who served 
with equal devotion in the same war? 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the heart of an intellectual wrangle over how history should be 
taught in British schools. 
</P>
<P>
One side says Britain's own history comes first. The other believes that, in 
what has become an ethnically diverse country, one child's footnote is 
another's historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Most students know about Cecil Rhodes, the Victorian empire builder who dreamed 
of a Cape-to-Cairo railroad. But how many have heard of King William Dappa 
Pepple Bonny V of Nigeria, who was exiled with his wife Annie from their realm 
and lived in London in the 19th Century? 
</P>
<P>
British children learn about Anglo-Saxon settlers, but the contribution of 
Jewish settlers in the Middle Ages is often overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Debate centers on a national "core" curriculum mandated by the Education Reform 
Bill of 1988 in history as well as English, math and science-technology. The 
reform limits local choices, but does not do away with them. 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum recommended by a history study group "is the only one that has 
generated the heat," Rozina Visram, a former teacher, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Academics from high and mighty universities have thrown their hats into the 
ring. No other document has been given such a long consultation." 
</P>
<P>
Those who approach history as a force in molding national pride and identity 
view the curriculum reform as a means of regaining the ground that has been 
slipping away since the liberal 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
They want a return to teaching Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's "great 
landmarks of British history": the life of King Henry VIII, Nelson's victory at 
Trafalgar, the Battle of Waterloo, the Battle of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend that minority history must be included in a country whose 
ethnic minorities now total 2.6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Children of the inner cities will not "switch on to an all-white male 
experience," said Sylvia Collicott, a senior lecturer at the North London 
Polytechnic. 
</P>
<P>
"In the classroom, you can't tell kids what to do; they won't do that anymore. 
They expect to be engaged. They won't sit there and take that." 
</P>
<P>
Local schools have adapted to the cultural changes. In Bradford, where 53 of 
the 231 schools have non-white majorities, students learn a little of 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
Tonnie Ecker's children attend Birkby School in Kirkliees, suburban Bradford, 
where "just about every ethnic festival is celebrated." 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful," she said. "They come back and tell you the stories about 
various gods and all that. Sometimes their hands are covered for three days 
with mehandi patterns," butterfly or flower designs painted in a reddish dye. 
</P>
<P>
The reform does not prohibit local diversity and ethnic celebrations, but 
critics say it makes so many detailed prescriptions of what should be in the 
curriculum that it leaves no room for ethnic studies. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Skidelsky, a historian at Warwick University, said history trains people 
for citizenship, "and it touches many raw nerves." 
</P>
<P>
So vehemently have academics disagreed that some fear the government will 
abandon the history reforms.. 
</P>
<P>
Skidelsky got into the debate when his son took a test that instructed him to 
"imagine that you are a Palestinian gunman attacking the Israeli Olympic team 
in Munich." 
</P>
<P>
The question was part of the empathy theory of teaching history, which asks 
students to imagine themselves as players on the historical stage. 
</P>
<P>
"There were too many theories floating around," Skidelsky said in an interview. 
"Pupils were becoming guinea pigs." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Barber, education policy director for the National Union of Teachers, 
feels the curriculum is too detailed. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need at the national level is an interstate highway map of the 
country, as opposed to a map of all the local state roads and foot paths," said 
Barber, a former high school history teacher. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the history working group says students aged 7 to 11 should study 
invaders and settlers; the Romans, Anglo-Saxons and Vikings in Britain; life in 
Tudor and Stuart times; Victorian Britain; ancient Egypt and Greece, and 
exploration from 1450 to 1550. 
</P>
<P>
Each topic is divided into four areas: political; economic, 
technological-scientific; social-religious and cultural-aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds and hundreds of detailed prescriptions," said Ted Wragg, 
director of Exeter University's school of education. 
</P>
<P>
He finds the proposals arbitrary. As an example, he said, students aged 14 to 
16 studying modern American history would be required to learn about President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but President John F. 
Kennedy and the civil rights movement would be optional. 
</P>
<P>
Detractors, including the teachers' union, say less than the recommended 50% of 
class time should be devoted to British history. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher supports a heavy emphasis on British history and told the House of 
Commons concentrating on the names of England's kings and queens, statesmen and 
battles is "absolutely right." 
</P>
<P>
Skidelsky feels the proposed curriculum benefits the majority: "Some areas have 
got to adopt entirely unconventional methods, but most people in Britain are 
part of the great middle class bulge and go to a very standard school." 
</P>
<P>
Although the opposition Labor Party accused Thatcher of seeking to indoctrinate 
children with her own view of history, Skidelsky doesn't believe politics is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has felt a responsibility to increase its involvement because 
of testing which shows British school children are behind those in other 
countries," he said.

CHILDREN WHO KILL; 
</P>
<P>
BOY, 9, LIVES WITH HORROR OF KILLING FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE ESPER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BEAVER FALLS, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The boy was 8 years old when he killed his father, plunging a kitchen knife 
into the back of the man who had taken him fishing and taught him how to play 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He is 9 years old now, and though he remembers every moment of that horrible 
night -- how his father attacked his mother, how he went to the kitchen to get 
the knife, how his father cried out when he was stabbed -- the child does not 
quite believe that his father is dead. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept repeating recently he's not coming back like he was hoping he might," 
said his psychiatrist, Dr. Marianne Krouk. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not emotionally ready to come to terms with the loss. He still has 
fantasies about going to reunions with his dad. He's trying to step back from 
that by saying he was a no-good alcoholic and should have been gone." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when he should be accumulating childhood memories of school days and 
favorite pets, this light-haired, slightly built boy -- his name is being 
withheld because of his age -- is saddled with memories of patricide that will 
scar him for life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are great consequences for the future even if he . . . manages 
to . . . do well in his daily life," Krouk said. "I think he's at risk for 
suicide, just by overwhelming guilt and coming to terms that he took his 
father's life and maybe he doesn't deserve to live." 
</P>
<P>
It happened on March 31. The boy's mother, Monica Jones, 36, testified before a 
coroner's inquest that her 59-year-old husband, William, choked her in bed 
while accusing her of "running around." She denied it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to kill you tonight," he told her. 
</P>
<P>
They drove to the home of a man who, the husband said, had told him he was 
being cuckolded. The man denied saying it, and before the Joneses left, Monica 
Jones told the man her husband was going to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
"We went home," Monica Jones said. "He threw the keys at me, wanted me to put 
the key in the lock and I wouldn't. He choked me. He said: 'You want to put the 
key in,' and I shook my head yes. He let me up. I screamed hard and he grabbed 
me again and we were on the glider and he choked me again." 
</P>
<P>
His mother's screams awakened the boy from a couch in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
He told police he thought that "she was going to get hurt or something. I 
thought he was going to get the gun like he did last time," when Jones pointed 
a rifle at his wife's head last September while the boy watched. 
</P>
<P>
The boy said he did not look outside to see what was happening but ran into the 
kitchen and got an 8 1/2-inch filet knife. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom was sitting on the glider and my dad was about to choke her when I put 
the knife in his back." He said he feared for his own safety as well as his 
mother's: "I didn't want him to hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
"He said: 'Ow.' He said: 'Mom, he put a knife in my back,' " the boy told 
police in a taped statement. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Jones recalled that she looked up and told her son to get help. She 
picked up a baseball bat and hit her husband across the shoulders so he 
couldn't go after the boy. "He was going to get up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy ran to a neighbor's house. "I ran because I didn't want him to come 
after me. I saw the light over there so I went there and said: 'My dad was 
beating up my mom,' and they let me in so I could call the police. I didn't 
want to go back outside because I thought he still might be out there." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's jury cleared the boy in the stabbing; authorities urged a finding 
of justifiable homicide, and the stories told by the boy and his mother were 
corroborated by a pathologist's testimony that Jones was legally intoxicated 
and by the fact that Monica Jones had bruises on her neck and chin. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing his father in death at the funeral home, the boy said he looked as he 
did all the time. Krouk recalled that the boy "kept saying: 'He just looked 
like he was sleeping,' like he was wishing he would get up." 
</P>
<P>
That the boy would grieve for such a father might be surprising to some. But 
there is evidence that William Jones was not always a monster; Monica Jones 
testified that her marriage had gone downhill just in the last two years, when 
her husband's drinking had increased. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball tied father and son together. They had planned for the father to coach 
his son's Little League team this season, and the boy still regrets that it 
never came to pass. 
</P>
<P>
But he also remembers the time he tried to explain to his father how to play a 
Nintendo game. Apparently threatened by his son's facility with the game, the 
father did not want to hear about it. He slapped the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't understand why he would hurt him," Krouk said. 
</P>
<P>
The killing and its aftermath have been especially hard for this little boy 
because he wants most of all to do well. His third-grade teacher, Vada Damaska, 
says he is an avid reader who loves baseball and football stories, a 
well-liked, clean-cut boy who made all A's and Bs. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to tease him that he could take over for me," she said. "He knew what 
was going on in the classroom because he always paid close attention." 
</P>
<P>
"He's very concerned about getting A's, doing well, and he doesn't enjoy being 
perceived as a bad kid . . . " Krouk said. "He has a well-developed conscience" 
and "is going to suffer, I think, with recurring depression." 
</P>
<P>
After his father's death, the boy acted up in ways he had never done before. He 
screamed at his mother and was unwilling to do daily chores. 
</P>
<P>
"He does have a lot of anger that borders on rage," Krouk said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the doctor says, he may revile his mother because she did not 
shield him from a "situation where he was forced to witness abuse and violence 
and hear a lot of things that a kid his age shouldn't have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
And eventually, Krouk says, the boy will ask himself: "How could I take another 
life?" He is at risk for suicidal depression on the one hand, and alcoholism 
and antisocial behavior on the other, Krouk says. 
</P>
<P>
For now, he is trying to get on with his life. He joined that Little League 
team that his father had intended to coach; his new coach told the other kids 
that he was there to play ball and that was all they were going to talk to him 
about. Talk of the stabbing would mean dismissal from the team.

Cameron Kocher dreams of death and dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
In one dream, an old man dies, only to rise from his grave the next day to buy 
ice cream for Cameron. In another, two dinosaurs fight in a courtroom -- a 
judge dinosaur in a tuxedo, and a lawyer dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
If these dreams are somehow jarring, there is a reason. Cameron Kocher does not 
lead a normal life; he is charged with killing a 7-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron Kocher is 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron was six weeks shy of his 10th birthday on March 6, 1989. It had snowed 
that day, and school was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica and Crystal Carr took advantage of the unexpected vacation to visit the 
six children of Richard and Trudy Ratti. Cameron was there too; he lived next 
door, and his parents had left for work early. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron, stocky and sandy-haired, often played Nintendo at the Ratti house. He 
didn't have his own game at home. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, the kids played "Spy Hunter"; Brian Ratti, then 12, said 
7-year-old Jessica bragged to Cameron, "I got my own Nintendo. Now I can get 
further than you. I beat the dragon." 
</P>
<P>
The game ended when Richard Ratti pulled the plug because the kids had left 
dirty cups and bowls in the room. Cameron was annoyed -- "He said he didn't 
leave any of the bowls and cups in there," the father recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The other children went out to ride the snowmobiles. Brian Ratti asked Cameron 
if he wanted to ride and he replied: "My mom and dad won't let me." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Cameron returned home angry, unlocked his father's gun cabinet 
with a key he took from a secret hiding place in the bottom of a lamp, pulled 
out a high-powered hunting rifle and loaded it with the correct ammunition, 
selected from several different types. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said he took the screen out of a second-story window and fired 
into the Rattis' yard 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Ratti said she did not hear the shot. She and Jessica, best friends, 
were riding a single snowmobile, with Shannon at the front. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden she started leaning against me. I asked her not to and she 
kept leaning. Suddenly, I figured something must be wrong with her," Shannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She turned to face a suddenly grotesque figure. "Her eyes were rolled way back 
into her head," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet had torn through the middle of Jessica's back, propelling her 
forward. Within minutes her short life was ended. 
</P>
<P>
The Rattis and the Carrs didn't know what was going on at first. They thought a 
gunman might be loose in the neighborhood, and Richard Ratti telephoned Cameron 
to get back to the Ratti house so he wouldn't be alone. 
</P>
<P>
When Cameron returned to the house the other children were crying as Jessica 
lay mortally wounded in the living room. Brian Ratti said Cameron remarked: "If 
you don't think about it, you won't feel bad." 
</P>
<P>
Then he went back to playing Nintendo, Jessica's mother said. 
</P>
<P>
What to do with an 11-year-old killer? 
</P>
<P>
Could this boy of impeccable background, education and manners -- never before 
in trouble, admired by teacher, minister, Cub Scout leader -- kill out of 
vindictiveness, the implied motive? 
</P>
<P>
Could this even-tempered boy who, it is said, never struck out at anybody, 
understand the magnitude and finality of such a deed? Or was it "all just a 
terrible mistake," as a state police investigator quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron initially lied to state police, telling them he had been sleeping when 
the shooting occurred. He gave two different versions of how he cut his 
forehead; it was later determined he was cut when the rifle's scope kicked 
back. 
</P>
<P>
His explanations of what happened on that winter day have varied. Dr. Harris 
Rabinovich, a child psychiatrist, testified for the prosecution that Cameron 
told him he was playing hunter and the rifle discharged. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Martha Turnberg, the treating psychiatrist, testified for the defense that 
Cameron told her he was looking through the scope at the trees and snow and he 
did not see any children. He denied intentionally firing the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Under Pennsylvania law, a murder charge must be filed in regular Criminal 
Court. A child between the ages of 7 and 14 is presumed incapable of committing 
a crime. The prosecutor, Mark P. Pazuhanich, said he is ready to present 
evidence to overcome that presumption. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge, Ronald E. Vican, denied a defense motion to transfer the case 
to Juvenile Court, where real confinement likely would be avoided and there 
would be no adult criminal record. Vican said it was a "deliberate and willful 
killing" and that Cameron shows no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
"We customarily associate the crime of murder with adults, or at least older 
juveniles," Vican said. 
</P>
<P>
"Young children do kill. . . . Homicides involving child killers are increasing 
at an alarming rate. Neither society nor our system of criminal justice is 
sufficiently prepared to . . . satisfactorily handle situations involving young 
killers." 
</P>
<P>
Cameron's attorney appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, arguing that the 
boy is innocent because of his age, that he is unable to understand the charges 
against him and is not competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was anything that he did, and I'm saying a big if, that resulted in 
the death of this little girl, he doesn't connect it intellectually," said the 
attorney, Charles Hansford. 
</P>
<P>
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed in June to hear arguments, probably by 
the end of this year, on whether Cameron should be tried as an adult in 
Criminal Court or as a child in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is unlikely, Cameron could face a mandatory life sentence if he is 
convicted of first-degree murder. The prosecutor said that he will not decide 
until the approach of any trial whether to seek a first-degree conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But he said at the very least he will seek a third-degree conviction. 
Sentencing would be largely within the discretion of the trial judge, ranging 
from probation at home to long-term confinement. 
</P>
<P>
Pazuhanich has received hate mail from some who object to Cameron's 
prosecution. "There's no question I'm taking heat over it," he said. "There is 
certainly substantial sympathy for the boy." 
</P>
<P>
A public trial as opposed to closed proceedings in Juvenile Court could be 
devastating for Cameron, said Dr. Marshall Schechter, a defense psychiatrist 
who examined the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Schechter found Cameron suffering from depression and 
</P>
<P>
post-traumatic stress disorder, a delayed trauma associated mainly with Vietnam 
veterans, whose symptoms include anxiety and difficulty in relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, he said, Cameron could become suicidal. Oppressed by fears that 
others would hate him for what he had done, he might have trouble making 
friends; last year, the boy attended private school under an assumed name. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Cameron withdrew, wanting to hang around the house, ashamed 
and fearful of going into stores, needing to be close to his mother to the 
point where he would sit on her lap. Mrs. Kocher said her son was frightened 
and cried about the possibility of being taken away. 
</P>
<P>
His sleep was restless, interrupted by those unsettling dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a very limited understanding" of death, said Turnberg. 
</P>
<P>
Turnberg said Cameron is sad about Jessica's death. "As far as remorse meaning 
he accepts responsibility that he intentionally caused her death, no. He 
doesn't understand or accept the fact that he fired the shot that killed her 
except insofar as what other people have told him." 
</P>
<P>
Cameron's is not the only life that lies in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron's parents, Keith and Patricia Kocher, also are victims. They are 
working-class folks -- he is a laborer, she a seamstress. They took a second 
mortgage on their raised ranch home and spent the $25,000 they had scraped 
together for Cameron's education for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
They put up their home as security for Cameron's $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica's parents have since divorced. Her father, Claude Carr, retreated to 
his native Maine to seek solace. Her mother, Donna, withdrew into a new home 
and a new life with her share of $300,000 from the Kochers' insurance company. 
She cries at the memory of Jessica and fled into the house in tears when a 
reporter mentioned her name. 
</P>
<P>
The Ratti children no longer play in the yard where Jessica was killed; they 
moved in May. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ratti said his marriage nearly collapsed amid the stress and the press 
coverage. Ratti himself faces charges that he fired a shotgun though a door of 
a home where his wife had gone last Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
His children are so unnerved that their schoolwork suffered. "My son's 13. He 
wouldn't go down and see his dog after dark." 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't sleep at night," said Ratti's wife, Trudy. "They were waking up 
by nightmares. Shannon thinks about it a lot. She'll never really be the same 
ever again from it. . . . She knows how close she came to dying too." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, now 14, is filled with guilt. What if she had speeded up the 
snowmobile? Or slowed down? Or stopped? Could she have dodged the bullet? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to hurt her," she cried.

SINGAPORE PREPARES FOR CHANGE TO A YOUNGER, MORE RELAXED LEADERSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: NEW MIDDLE CLASS TIRES OF GOVERNMENT'S INTOLERANCE OF DISSENT AND 
PERCEIVED MICRO-MANAGEMENT OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 25 years of ruling this prosperous island city-state with an 
iron hand, Lee Kuan Yew has announced that he will step down as prime minister 
later this year to make way for younger leaders who promise a more relaxed 
style of governing. 
</P>
<P>
But with Lee vowing to stay active in political affairs, many Singaporeans and 
foreign analysts say they are uncertain how far the new leaders will be allowed 
to move away from authoritarianism in order to accommodate a growing desire for 
change among young, affluent professionals. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the planned transition here shows that Singapore has been 
affected by the movement toward political liberalization that has toppled 
communist regimes in Eastern Europe -- even though Asia's authoritarian 
governments have long held that this part of the world is different from 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Asians, according to their argument, have an ingrained cultural preference for 
a strong, paternalistic ruler and tend to be more respectful of authority than 
Westerners. And, so the argument goes, most authoritarian governments here have 
responded to popular needs by successfully managing their countries' economies 
rather than embarking on political liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
East Asia and Southeast Asia are home to some of the world's fastest-growing 
economies, as well as to some highly authoritarian governments. Singapore is an 
example of this combination. 
</P>
<P>
By linking itself with the major economies of the world and becoming a 
financial and trading hub, Singapore overcame its geographic vulnerability and 
lack of natural resources to now boast the second highest per capita income in 
the region next to Japan. This city-state, with only 2.7 million people, is 
widely referred to as one of Asia's "Little Dragons," a newly industrializing 
country alongside Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
But economic prosperity has come at a price in terms of political freedoms. 
When Singapore was made independent in August, 1965, it was threatened by an 
active communist insurgency and torn by racial and religious divisions. Lee, 
through his People's Action Party, purged the country's suspected communist 
leaders, with most jailed under the sweeping Internal Security Act. But still 
today, decades later, government critics suspected of communist leanings face 
detention without trial. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, while legal, are not encouraged, and its leaders are often 
legally harassed. Recently, J. B. Jeyaretnam, head of the opposition Worker's 
Party, lost a libel suit brought by Lee for remarks Jeyaretnam made during a 
1988 rally, and was ordered to pay a large fine to the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The press, too, is limited. Arguing that restrictions are necessary to avoid 
inflaming racial and religious tensions in this culturally diverse country, the 
government has warned the press that its role is to help build popular support 
for official policies and not to act as a watchdog like the Western press. 
</P>
<P>
The circulations of two foreign publications, the Asian Wall Street Journal and 
the Far Eastern Economic Review, have been severely restricted and their 
reporters barred from the country after the government accused them of 
"interfering" in Singapore's domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers, including Western diplomats and some Singaporeans, believe the 
country's new middle class has grown tired of the government's intolerance of 
dissent and the perceived micro-management of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
The government, for example, limits the number of new automobiles that may be 
purchased and fines citizens heavily for jaywalking, littering and for failing 
to keep public toilets clean. It has launched "politeness" campaigns and takes 
an active interest in the lives of all citizens, drawing complaints from some 
young Singaporeans. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the ruling party is still popular, but each successive election has 
shown a small erosion of its public support, most recently in 1988 when it won 
61.8%, its lowest total ever. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Lee has announced that he is stepping aside, and his designated 
successor, Goh Chok Tong, the current first deputy prime minister and defense 
minister, is promising leadership that is less domineering, more open to 
accommodating differing viewpoints and more suitable to the demands of a modern 
and affluent society. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's Singapore is very different from yesterday's Singapore," Goh said in 
an interview at the Defense Ministry, where his office is located. "We started 
off as an independent nation born out of separation from Malaysia. We went 
through struggles, and communal conflicts and so on, to build today's 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are much better off today, well-educated. There is a larger pool at 
the top who can contribute very much to policy-making, formulation (and) 
analysis. So one of the changes I have in mind is to get this group to play a 
bigger role in building the next stage for Singapore. Hence I have chosen to 
have a more decentralized style of government." 
</P>
<P>
Comparing himself to the domineering Lee, Goh opted for a wartime analogy. "I 
think Mr. Lee was more like a revolutionary leader -- a strategist, a 
propagandist, a commander, a commando -- all rolled into one. I think I am more 
like a commander-in-chief of a conventional army in peacetime." 
</P>
<P>
Goh conceded that his style is being prompted partly by rising popular 
resentment of authoritarianism. "People think that we overgovern. They resent 
it." He said many younger Singaporeans believe that the government is "very 
good, very efficient but very autocratic." 
</P>
<P>
One of Goh's first tasks will be to persuade skeptics that the leadership 
change, now scheduled for November, will be genuine. Lee will stay on in the 
Cabinet as a senior minister without portfolio, and many here question whether 
the soft-spoken, bespectacled Goh will be able to assert his consensual style 
over the dominant Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The premier himself aptly described his own driving personality two years ago, 
when first discussing his plan to step down, he said: "Even from my sick bed, 
even if you are going to lower me into the grave, and I feel that something is 
going wrong, I'll get up." 
</P>
<P>
Goh will also have to contend with emerging young leaders drawn into civilian 
jobs from the military and led by the prime minister's son, Brig. Gen. Lee 
Hsien Loong. The younger Lee is believed to hold views on governing that are 
closer to his father's than are Goh's. 
</P>
<P>
The perception here is widespread that Goh will be a caretaker prime minister 
until the younger Lee, known as "B.G.," takes over. 
</P>
<P>
"What chance has Goh got, wedged in between Lee Kuan Yew on one side and B. G. 
Lee on the other side?" said Jeyaretnam, the opposition leader. He said the 
announced plan for a more open style "is all just for public consumption. A lot 
of foreigners are taken in by it. . . . It's for public image." 
</P>
<P>
Goh, in the interview, seemed aware of the perception of many that Lee will 
continue to play a dominant role here. While noting that Lee is a "dominant 
man," Goh said he does not think Lee would "be overbearing in giving his 
views."

U.N. UNIVERSITY SEEKS FUNDS FROM U.S. 
</P>

<P>
The United Nations University has been working for 15 years to become a center 
for academic solutions to global problems but has won scant recognition and no 
funding from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It's not for lack of trying. 
</P>
<P>
Dedicated to the idea that peace can only be advanced through development, U.N. 
University fellows have put their skills to use in every corner of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The university has no campus, no faculty and no students, in the traditional 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the university's work is done by the 1,600 research fellows it has 
funded from 114 countries. 
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua, they developed a process for turning vegetable fiber into 
charcoal to power a special automobile engine. 
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, fellows mapped out natural hazards to locate areas of potential 
landslides and avalanches. 
</P>
<P>
In India, a university project developed simple comic book manuals to teach 
skills needed to improve food, water, housing and health management in 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on. But despite the many successes, the United States has turned 
down repeated requests to aid the university. 
</P>
<P>
President Carter supported funding for the university during his term, but 
Congress balked. President Reagan, who cut U.S. funding for UNESCO, put a 
damper on any new allocations to U.N. agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But U.N. University is hopeful that with the Cold War ending and more attention 
being focused on development and environment, the United States will see the 
value of the university's work. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to try again," said Heitor Gurgulino de Souza, a Brazilian 
educator and the university's rector. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan has provided $100 million for operating expenses plus at least 
$80 million for the construction of a permanent headquarters in central Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Finland, where the U.N. University World Institute for Development Economics 
Research is located, has contributed $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
The only U.N. University center located in the Third World, the Institute for 
Natural Resources in Africa, is in the Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Ivory Coast has pledged to donate $5 million to the university, the highest 
among any developing country except oil-rich Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations itself gives no financial support to the university that 
bears its name. The university is left to raise money from U.N. member 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
As of June, 47 nations had contributed or pledged a total of $210 million to 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
The university hopes to turn the contributions into a vehicle for peace in the 
post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. University, founded in 1975, aims to bridge the economic gap by bringing 
together the world's intellectual resources with the people who need them most. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the world's knowledge lies unused behind walls of ignorance, 
indifference and inefficiency," says the university's public relations 
literature. "The U.N. University seeks to breach these walls and channel 
knowledge where it is most needed." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem lies in the fact that the intellectual resources are 
concentrated in the richest countries. 
</P>
<P>
The university itself is constricted by this reality. Its headquarters and main 
facilities are in the countries that have donated the most money -- Japan and 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
That is because one of the main selling points the university can offer a 
potential donor is to locate a facility in the donor's country. 
</P>
<P>
To build a presence in poorer countries, the university carries out much of its 
work away from the main facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The 82 employees in Tokyo and 14 in Helsinki coordinate research and training 
projects around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how beautiful of a book I have published here in English, it will 
never reach a poor farmer in Brazil who cannot even read Portuguese," Gurgulino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. University was first proposed in 1969 by U.N. Secretary General U 
Thant. In 1973, the concept was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, and in 
1975 the university opened its doors. 
</P>
<P>
To commemorate its 15th year, the university will be host to three major 
conferences in Tokyo this fall and winter.

YOUNG EXILES TRAIN THEIR SIGHTS ON CUBA

<P>
Outside a wooden house in the steamy Florida Everglades, Alejandra Piniella 
advances, closing in on the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager raises her AK-47, then kicks in the door while her backups move 
in. "Good!" yells a trainer from an upstairs window as he lobs a firecracker to 
imitate the pop of a grenade launch. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella dons fatigues many Sunday mornings to attend basic training in search 
of the dream of many Cuban exiles -- retaking the communist Caribbean island. 
Now 17, she is too young to have experienced the 1959 Cuban Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But she is one of several young Cubans learning weekend maneuvers with the 
militant exile group Alpha 66. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel at all American," said Piniella, a University of Miami junior 
majoring in biology. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised as an American with the knowledge that we are returning to our 
country," she said. Like several youths in training, she expects change 
resulting from political discontent with the island's current economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Within days, weeks or months, there is going to be some type of coup d'etat or 
uprising that will bring the situation to a head." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella hopes more youths will join the group, which claims to have 5,000 
members across the country. Fifty are practicing today. 
</P>
<P>
What was a movement of old men has become a group of whom one-third are under 
20. 
</P>
<P>
"Most young Cubans I speak to are willing to go back to their country. It's not 
a movement of the old times at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although these youths don't reflect the views of a majority of Cuban-American 
youth, they claim to be committed to a political change, even a takeover, in 
Cuba. Many grew up in Alpha 66, steeped in hard-line tradition by their parent 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Lara, 14, has been training with his father for seven months. He 
practices firing an AK-47 in hopes of taking back a country he never knew. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my father's country, but I care about it," said Lara, smoking a 
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
The Everglades location, called "Rambo Sur," or south passage, has been used 
for years by exiles in training. It is made up of 10 acres of prairie muck 
where exiles of many ages climb ropes, practice formations and practice target 
shots in hopes they will get to invade Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Under a canopy, weapons, including AK-47s and Israeli-made Galil rifles, are 
stacked. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman walks by and absently points a rifle in the direction of several 
other recruits, apparently unaware of basic gun safety rules that forbid 
casually pointing a weapon at others. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, several founders of Alpha 66 discuss politics. "We know that changes 
must come from inside, but we want to be there to help," said Andres Nozario 
Sargenz, 70, an Alpha 66 founder. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a lone American in fatigues and a ski mask lectures three dozen men and 
women about taking over a house. "Don't touch the building. Something might 
fall inside," he cautions the volunteers taking turns to sneak toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
The American's name is Willy, and he appears to be in his early 20s. No one, 
including Willy, will say who he works for or what he is paid, but he is 
clearly in charge of training. He barks an order, which is then translated into 
Spanish for the older Alpha 66 members. The translation time creates a delayed 
reaction between his issuing a command and the group's response. 
</P>
<P>
But Willy is patient as well as zealous. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching the volunteers how to salute, he demonstrates the wrong way: "This 
resembles more of a communist salute," he says, dropping his hand slightly at 
his forehead, "and we won't have that." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella is brushing up on basic training, but soon she will specialize in 
marine invasions. 
</P>
<P>
"I will learn how to hide boats, rafts, paddle silently, hide weapons," said 
Piniella, who has learned to shoot a .22-caliber rifle, an AK-47 and a Colt 45. 
</P>
<P>
Some learn faster than others. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel they are doing something, even if they are not," Willy said. "They 
are at the military age. It's not just old guys talking about what could be." 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is teach the young," said Osiel Gonzalez, one of Alpha's 
founders. "Cuba is our children's future."

FAMOUS MIDWAY ATOLL LEFT TO FABLED GOONEY BIRDS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific atoll of Midway, which gave its name to one of the decisive battles 
of World War II, has become a land ruled by gooney birds. 
</P>
<P>
Almost deserted by the U.S. military for which it played a vital role for over 
30 years, the tiny island is home to an estimated 1 million black-footed 
albatrosses, popularly known as gooney birds. 
</P>
<P>
Another half-million birds of other species, all protected under U.S. law, also 
live there. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III stopped on Midway to refuel recently on a 
trip to Asia and he and the journalists accompanying him were treated to a tour 
of the island. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a short tour. The island is only a mile wide and a mile and a half 
long," warned Lt. Dan Messing, one of 11 military personnel stationed on 
Midway. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are several islands at Midway, enclosed by a reef with a 
circumference of about 15 miles. But only one is inhabited. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who takes a keen interest in wildlife, had asked to see gooneys. He need 
not have worried, they were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Messing said most of the young had already flown out to sea, where they would 
spend six or seven years before returning to Midway to nest. But there were 
still several thousands ungainly late developers sitting around -- on the 
runway, in the roads, on the island's nine-hole golf course, under the trees, 
on the beach -- in fact, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they nest on the greens on the golf course. If a ball comes near 
them, they think it is an egg and start sitting on it," Messing said. 
</P>
<P>
Crews of men have to clear the runway of gooneys before planes come in and 
prior to takeoff. The men patiently shooed the birds away to make way for the 
secretary of state, but they were soon waddling back to their places. 
</P>
<P>
Removing the corpses of up to 7,000 of the creatures that die every week is 
another vital maintenance job. The birds expire of a disease called "droop 
wing" or because they were prematurely abandoned by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Sea turtles abound in the brilliant turquoise sea, seals nest on the shore and 
sharks prowl the waters of the coral feeding on the young of gooneys who fail 
on their maiden flights or get washed away to sea before they can fly. 
</P>
<P>
Midway, a coral atoll lying 1,150 miles northwest of Honolulu, has no 
indigenous population. It was discovered by Americans, annexed in 1867 and 
given to the U.S. Navy to administer in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese forces launched a fierce attack on the island in June, 1942, but were 
intercepted by the U.S. Navy about 200 miles off the coast. The ensuing Battle 
of Midway is generally regarded as a turning point in the Pacific War. 
</P>
<P>
Midway continued to play a key strategic role well into the 1970s and the era 
of the Vietnam War. As recently as 1970, Messing said, there were up to 40,000 
Marines living on the island in tents. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a high school that bustled with activity two decades ago is abandoned 
and old living quarters are derelict. 
</P>
<P>
But it is still clear that Midway is part of America. Satellite television 
beams in everybody's favorite shows and a sign proudly welcomes visitors to 
Midway's shopping mall consisting of two shops, where Midway baseball caps are 
on sale for $5, the newspaper rack is well stacked with copies of Penthouse 
magazine, and liquor prices are cheaper than anywhere on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the handful of Navy personnel on one-year tours of duty, the 
island's human inhabitants consist of some 250 Asian workers employed in 
picking up dead birds and other vital maintenance, a small group of civilian 
engineers employed by the Navy and occasional scientific teams conducting field 
research. 
</P>
<P>
One such group is studying the effect of termites on wood in hope of developing 
a new preservative to defend against them. Another group is studying the 
volcanic development of the Hawaiian archipelago, to which Midway technically 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
Messing has been on Midway for 21 months and keeps extending his tour of duty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quiet here but I don't like big cities. Watching those gooneys is kind of 
peaceful," he said.

Australian astronomers said Friday they have discovered an asteroid several 
hundred yards long that crossed the Earth's orbital path in June. 
</P>
<P>
The asteroid, temporarily named 1990MU, came within 1.2 million miles of the 
Earth's surface and intersected the planet's path around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
It was found by astronomers Robert McNaught and Duncan Olsson-Steel, using 
telescopes at the Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran, New South 
Wales. 
</P>
<P>
They estimate 1990MU to be hundreds of yards long and say it should cross the 
Earth's path again in two years. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 asteroids crossing the Earth's path have been found, but scientists 
estimate that at least 1,000 exist. Most asteroids in the solar system are 
grouped between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

HOUSE'S 'STEALTH WHIP' CROSSES BARRIERS TO BUILD PARTY PRIDE AND UNITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman Rep. Mike Parker introduces House Majority Whip William H. Gray III to 
his Mississippi Delta district with an analogy between the ways of Washington 
and life in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
To survive, the gazelle must outrun the swiftest lion, and Gray, he says, "is 
the slickest and fastest gazelle in Washington D.C." 
</P>
<P>
As holder of the No. 3 leadership spot in the House, Gray surely is at the 
front of the pack. After little more than a decade in Congress, the 
Pennsylvania Democrat is in line to become the first black Speaker of the House 
and part of a small group of blacks mentioned as possible candidates on a 
future Democratic national ticket. 
</P>
<P>
He reached that stratum because political opposites such as Parker, a 
conservative white Democrat, have come to view him as an ally rather than an 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, visiting Jackson on a recent warm, moist day to campaign for Parker, is 
the first outside Democratic leader that Parker has brought to his district. He 
is expected to help with what political analysts call "crossover" support. 
</P>
<P>
Parker won his seat in 1988 refusing to endorse Democratic nominee Michael S. 
Dukakis, never mind Jesse Jackson, the winner of Mississippi's Democratic 
primary. But his Delta district is 37% black, and he, like many Southern 
Democrats, must hold the black vote. 
</P>
<P>
But to say Parker wanted Gray to visit just because of race is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Gray "confirms the connection with power in the House, which Mississippi 
likes," says Ed Cole, Parker's top aide and the Mississippi Democratic party 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Parker cites his personal rapport with Gray as the main reason for the 
invitation, especially the Northern liberal's "understanding that the country 
is different." 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Gray exemplifies the type of leadership and substance that attracts 
Democratic voters," says Hiram Eastland, a lawyer and cousin of the late Sen. 
James O. Eastland (D-Miss). Gray has "appeal that crosses racial and party 
lines," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, 48, came to Congress in 1979 and, as chairman of the freshman class, 
quickly learned about the breadth of viewpoints. He cut his teeth on forming 
coalitions when he won the chairmanship of the House Budget Committee in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
As budget chairman for four years, then chairman of the House Democratic 
Caucus, chairman of the 1988 Democratic Party platform committee, and for the 
past year majority whip, Gray has found consensus where critics said it 
couldn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
He also has found admirers in odd places. 
</P>
<P>
"Gray is not a standard ideological politician," says Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), the House minority whip who is Gray's opposite number on the House 
floor and in philosophy. "We both have a sense of mutual understanding which 
might surprise people." 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't surprise them much, though. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigning with Parker, Gray knows how to enhance his own power without 
flaunting it. How to nurture friendships by avoiding potential arguments. 
</P>
<P>
His job this day is to boost Parker and Mississippi Democrats, not himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is already making his presence felt," he tells preachers gathered to hear 
him at the Piney Woods Country Life School, an academy for black children 
outside Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The bespectacled, balding Gray, who still fulfills his Sunday duties as 
minister at the Bright Hope Baptist Church in Pennsylvania, delivers polished 
rhetoric. The clergymen take notes, no doubt stealing a few lines for their 
Sunday sermons, and give their Northern colleague an ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the school, Gray gives students an impromptu pep talk on 
personal success and the scourge of drugs. Then he and Parker zip downtown for 
a luncheon at a local restaurant with state Democratic officials. 
</P>
<P>
Gray "is a reconciliator. . . . He understands it takes 51% of the votes to win 
elections," Secretary of State Dick Molpus tells the group. The audience 
includes Rep. Mike Espy (D-Miss.), a Gray protege who is the only black in the 
state's congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Gray delivers a message of party pride and unity. "It's easy for the other team 
to get together because they all look alike, walk alike, are crazy alike," he 
says. "We come in all colors." 
</P>
<P>
It was about his only mention of race all day. He talks more of Mississippi, 
its powerful Democratic House delegation, and his own roots in the South. Gray 
was born in Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike, where's the catfish," he jokingly complains to Parker at event after 
event where they served trendy banquet food that could have been shipped from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
During an afternoon break, he exchanges his suit and tie for shorts and a 
T-shirt and plays tennis with Parker and Rep. G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery 
(D-Miss.), another conservative friend. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's back into his congressional uniform for more fund-raising and 
mingling. 
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Bill Wheeler, who is white, said having an "inclusive leader" like 
Gray come to Mississippi was important. "The conflict between black and white . 
. . is one of the major reasons" the state is last in national rankings for 
education and wealth, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Washington, Gray doesn't give his votes to the conservatives. He 
represents his district with a record that consistently gets a "zero" in the 
American Conservative Union ratings. 
</P>
<P>
What Gray does give to conservative and liberal Democrats alike, especially 
those in tough races, is money. 
</P>
<P>
He has a political action committee, the Committee for Democratic Opportunity, 
which donated more than $72,000 to other House members and aspirants this 
election cycle. The list includes Parker and Gene Taylor (D-Miss.), a new House 
member so conservative that he is frequently rumored to be switching parties. 
</P>
<P>
Gray also has contributed money from his personal campaign treasury to 
candidates and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps all 
the party's House candidates. 
</P>
<P>
A sought-after speaker for business and interest-group gatherings, Gray 
collected $164,098 in honorariums last year, among Congress' highest. 
</P>
<P>
While appealing to a wide audience, Gray carefully maintains his high profile 
in the black community. He has been a prime sponsor of legislation to send food 
aid to Ethiopia and impose economic sanctions on apartheid South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Other black lawmakers are quick to recognize Gray's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Jackie Robinson in the Congress of the United States," says Rep. Ronald 
V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, referring 
to the great athlete who broke through the color barrier in major league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the political juggling act is delicate. 
</P>
<P>
Gray appeared on behalf of Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.) earlier this year and, 
after he left, Savage told the gathering that Jews were financing his primary 
election opponent. Many observers considered Savage's comments anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite pressure from Jewish groups, Gray refused to comment on the incident 
for days until he could watch a videotape of Savage's speech. Then he condemned 
the remarks in a carefully worded statement that mended fences without 
vilifying Savage. 
</P>
<P>
For all his moderation, Gray has shown that when directly attacked, he can 
strike back with viperlike quickness. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when he was running for whip, a Justice Department official 
confirmed a "leak" that the FBI was investigating financial irregularities in 
Gray's congressional office. 
</P>
<P>
Gray immediately denied that he was under investigation and blasted the 
department, which is led by Attorney General and former Pennsylvania political 
foe Dick Thornburgh. Gray reacted so fiercely that the leak became as big a 
story as the investigation itself. 
</P>
<P>
He forced the Justice Department to take the unusual step of issuing a 
statement that Gray was not a target of the investigation and was cooperating 
with the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's response rallied his supporters. He not only survived but won the whip's 
job handily over Reps. Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.) and David E. Bonior (D-Mich). 
</P>
<P>
The whip's job is that of chief vote-counter and head-knocker for the 
Democratic leadership as it tries to pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's busy schedule of campaigning, speechmaking and other travel, including 
his church duties, has made him a less-visible presence on the House floor than 
his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
He relies on his staff to carry out the dull but important details of the job, 
and checks in by phone from the road. 
</P>
<P>
In his first year as whip, Gray also has deferred to Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt and Speaker Thomas S. Foley when it comes to leading the party charge 
on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
His style has earned him the in-House moniker, "The Stealth Whip," and a few 
fellow Democrats grumble privately that Republicans have squeezed through some 
things they shouldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
But he has lost only on one major vote so far, when the House last year passed 
President Bush's capital gains tax cut over the objections of the Democratic 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one we never could win," Gray recalls. 
</P>
<P>
His low profile is deliberate, he explains. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself as the chief of the engine room," he says. "The speaker and the 
majority leader are up on the bridge calling for full speed ahead, and I've got 
to give it to them."

THERAPY SHOWS PROMISE IN BLOCKING ONSET OF DIABETES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST POTENT DRUG MAY PREVENT OR DELAY FOR YEARS 
THE TYPE I FORM OF THE DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diabetes specialists around the country are beginning human trials of a new 
treatment that may be the most important advance in the disease since the 
advent of insulin therapy. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, physicians are identifying youths who are at high risk of 
developing juvenile-onset diabetes and treating them in hopes of preventing -- 
or at least delaying for many years -- the onset of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the most promising of the trials, physicians are treating the prospective 
diabetics with a potent drug that suppresses the immune system. Preliminary 
data suggests that, in many cases, this will halt the "autoimmune" attack on 
the pancreas that causes the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. Between 750,000 and 1 million Americans suffer from 
juvenile-onset diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent or Type I diabetes, 
according to the American Diabetes Assn., and 13,000 to 15,000 new cases are 
diagnosed each year. Most people contract Type I diabetes during childhood, but 
a small percentage develop it as adults. 
</P>
<P>
Although insulin injections can control the overt symptoms -- such as excessive 
thirst, urination and coma -- most diabetics eventually develop serious 
complications, including kidney damage, nerve damage in the arms and legs and 
vision loss. Treatment for diabetes and its complications costs the United 
States about $20.4 billion each year. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the new therapy could only delay the onset of diabetes, it would offer 
patients several more years of life free of these disabling complications. And 
should it prevent the disease, the patients would be free of those 
complications indefinitely, researchers say, although they would have to 
undergo the new therapy for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinarily promising avenue for study," said Robert E. 
Silverman, head of the diabetes branch at the National Institute of Diabetes 
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Md. "I don't want to overstate 
its significance, but this could really be hot stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The trials, to be conducted at the University of Florida Health Science Center, 
the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School, Denver Children's 
Hospital and the University of Washington in Seattle, represent "an exciting 
possibility," added Richard Kahn, medical director of the American Diabetes 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The new therapy has been found effective in extensive studies on laboratory 
animals. The best evidence that it will work in humans is seen in the 
experience of Peggy Polopolus, 21, who began the therapy in a pilot project 
five years ago. At that time, physicians at the University of Florida Health 
Science Center predicted she would develop Type I diabetes within six months. 
She still has not contracted the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Polopolus is being treated with a powerful drug called Imuran. The drug 
suppresses the immune system in much the same way it does to prevent the 
rejection of transplanted organs. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers caution that little is known about Imuran's long-term effects, but 
they are enthusiastic about its prospects. "If it (the therapy) works, a child 
of 10 might be on it for 60 years, and that's a long time," Kahn said. "We 
don't know what the drug will do to them, but we do know what is going to 
happen to them if they develop diabetes, and that could be much worse." 
</P>
<P>
The new approach to therapy is based on the growing recognition that Type I 
diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its own tissues -- 
in this case, the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
Insulin helps most of the body's cells take up biological fuels, especially the 
sugar glucose. In the absence of insulin, the glucose accumulates to high 
levels in the blood. Then the kidneys overwork themselves to filter excess 
glucose into urine. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, body cells starve in a sea of plenty, and thus must break down their 
own stores of fat and protein for energy. During this breakdown, acidic 
byproducts called ketones build up in the blood. Combined with the dehydration, 
these ketones induce coma and death. 
</P>
<P>
Type I diabetes can be treated with daily injections of insulin. These allow 
the patients to live a predominantly normal life. But because the injections 
are given only two to four times per day, at most, levels of glucose in the 
blood vary widely, and these variations are thought to cause the complications 
of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists do not yet know why the immune system attacks the beta cells, but 
both genetics and viral infections are thought to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes specialists once thought that the destruction of the beta cells was a 
fairly rapid process, occurring perhaps over a matter of a few months. Now, 
however, it is clear that the process can take as long as seven years, and that 
the onset of diabetes itself does not occur until at least 80% of the beta 
cells in the pancreas have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, if that destructive process can be detected, it might be possible to 
arrest it before too much damage is done. 
</P>
<P>
The key seems to lie in certain antibodies whose normal function is to fight 
disease; diabetes victims, however, are plagued with antibodies that attack 
their own bodies. In the last 15 years, researchers have discovered three 
different antibodies that can indicate destruction of beta cells: 
</P>
<P>
* Islet-cell autoantibody is thought to be directed against a fat molecule 
found in the interior of islet cells. 
</P>
<P>
* Antibodies against insulin, present in virtually all patients who have 
received insulin therapy, are believed to exist years before the onset of 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
* The most recently identified and potentially most important antibody works 
against an unidentified protein, 64-K, which appears to be present in only the 
membrane of beta cells. Pathologist Mark A. Atkinson of the University of 
Florida has found that this antibody can be detected in humans as many as seven 
years before diabetes symptoms occur. 
</P>
<P>
If elevated concentrations of all three antibodies are present in a person's 
blood, Kahn said, then "it's a virtual certainty that person will develop 
diabetes within three years." 
</P>
<P>
For several years, researchers at various medical centers have been treating 
newly diagnosed type I diabetics with the immune-suppressing drug cyclosporine 
-- the same drug that has revolutionized organ transplants during the last 
decade -- in an effort to retard development of the disease. The treatments 
typically delay the patient's need for insulin from six months to two years, 
but no longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that by the time these patients had symptoms of diabetes, they 
had lost most of their insulin-producing islet cells," said Florida 
endocrinologist William Riley. Furthermore, cyclosporine has a number of 
serious side effects, including liver damage and an increased incidence of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In an article in the current issue of the journal Diabetes Care, 
endocrinologist Rebecca Lipton and her colleagues at the University of 
Pittsburgh conclude that the benefits from such therapy are too low to justify 
the risk. "Further use of the immuno-suppressive agent cyclosporine cannot be 
justified," they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The approach must therefore be to treat children before they actually develop 
the symptoms of diabetes and to use a drug that has fewer side effects than 
cyclosporine, said Florida pathologist Noel Maclaren. 
</P>
<P>
The tests for antibodies identify potential diabetics, and the drug of choice 
is Imuran, which has been used for a quarter-century as an anti-rejection drug 
and for a somewhat shorter time as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. It is 
less effective than cyclosporine at blocking rejection, but it has fewer side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Polopolus, who now works for an advertising agency in New York City, was 
the first patient Riley and Maclaren treated with Imuran. Peggy was 14 when her 
younger sister, Eleni, developed Type I diabetes. The Florida researchers were 
then screening large numbers of diabetics' relatives to study the reliability 
of antibody testing. They found that islet cell autoantibodies were present in 
Peggy, but at low levels. 
</P>
<P>
Because her grandfather had also had Type I diabetes and two aunts had the 
less-severe but more common form of diabetes known as Type II, the researchers 
continued watching her. (Type I diabetes has long been known to run in 
families. Siblings of diabetes patients have as much as an 11% risk of 
developing the condition -- much higher than the overall population risk of 16 
cases per 100,000.) 
</P>
<P>
About a year later, her blood-sugar levels starting climbing and her insulin 
levels started falling. Riley put her on Imuran, and she has been taking two 
50-milligram tablets every day since. 
</P>
<P>
Polopolus said the Imuran therapy has not had any adverse effects on her. "I've 
had colds every once in a while, but I was prone to getting colds anyway." She 
did develop mononucleosis during college, but Riley believes that was unrelated 
to Imuran use. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, her blood-sugar level, which was above normal when she began 
the regimen, dropped back into the normal range and has stayed there ever 
since. Polopolus believes she has been "incredibly lucky" to be spared the 
insulin injections that her sister must take. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, Maclaren and their colleagues treated one other patient, an 8-year-old 
girl who had more beta-cell damage than Polopolus when she began the therapy. 
The onset of her disease was delayed for four years. After beginning her 
therapy, however, the researchers decided not to treat any more patients until 
they had accumulated more information on the predictive value of the 
antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
"We were too far ahead of ourselves," Riley said. "We couldn't convince other 
people we had the data." 
</P>
<P>
Now, based on several studies in which Imuran prevented development of diabetes 
in rodents, they believe they have the data, and other researchers agree. In 
April, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 
convened in Washington to consider theirs and other research. That conference 
concluded that the time was ripe to begin wider clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the four medical centers plan to screen 8,000 to 10,000 close 
relatives of patients with Type I diabetes. The initial screening will be for 
islet cell autoantibodies. Individuals who test positive will then be studied 
for insulin antibodies and impaired insulin secretion. Those who test positive 
for these characteristics will be enrolled in the study. Those who do not will 
be re-examined every six months. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 80% of those who are positive for these tests are expected to 
develop diabetes within five years without treatment. The accuracy could be 
improved, Riley said, if they tested for anti-64-K antibodies, but that test is 
still too expensive and cumbersome. But he predicts it will be used within a 
year or so. 
</P>
<P>
From this testing, the four centers expect to identify 75 to 80 children who 
are at high risk. These will be treated with Imuran and monitored for as long 
as necessary. The first patient identified began Imuran treatment in Florida 
four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers at Harvard are attempting a different approach. Tests in 
animals have shown that administering insulin to potential diabetics before the 
pancreas is severely damaged can interfere with the immune attack, even block 
it completely. During the therapy, called "beta-cell rest," the pancreas 
sharply reduces its insulin production. Furthermore, the proteins on the 
surface of beta cells that are attacked by the immune system disappear, halting 
the attack, said Harvard endocrinologist Richard Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Two children have so far been enrolled in the study -- 16-year-old Sean Finley 
of Alexandria, La., and 9-year-old John Moore of Indianapolis. Each takes two 
doses of insulin per day that total about one-quarter the normal daily dose for 
a diabetic. Every nine months, they fly to Boston for a week of intensive 
intravenous insulin therapy that attempts to shut off the pancreas completely. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is that, even though the boys have to take insulin daily, the pancreas 
will continue to function well enough to prevent the wide swings in blood-sugar 
concentration that cause the complications of diabetes. Sean has been in the 
program 18 months and John for 12 months with no apparent decline in pancreatic 
function. Each was expected to develop diabetes within three years of 
diagnosis, so it is too soon to tell if the treatment is successful. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard group hopes to enroll three to five more patients in the trial, but 
endocrinologist George Eisenbarth conceded that most pre-diabetics the group 
identifies will be enrolled in the Imuran trial because it seems more 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
If the clinical trials prove successful, the next stage will expand the 
procedure to larger population groups. Even though relatives of diabetics have 
a high risk of developing the disease, they nonetheless represent a small 
minority of all Type I diabetes victims. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the entire population under age 25 would have to be screened, an 
exceptionally daunting prospect. And because the age of onset varies, children 
would have to be screened periodically in order to detect the first signs. 
</P>
<P>
That task would be simplified if researchers could identify a gene that would 
be highly predictive of diabetes risk. But that possibility is in the distant 
future, and researchers are now concentrating only on the first stages. The 
therapies, Maclaren said, "are certainly going to work. The questions we are 
going to have to settle are for how long, how well and at what cost?" 
</P>
<P>
"And even if we are only able to delay onset for a number of years," added 
endocrinologist David M. Kipnis of Washington University in St. Louis, "that's 
a real accomplishment."

IRAQ WARNS OF DIRE SUFFERING FOR DETAINEES

<P>
Their land and sea supply routes strangled, Iraqi officials lashed out Saturday 
with new threats against detained foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The infants and elderly among the captive foreigners will suffer the same 
deprivations as the Iraqis, Baghdad Television warned. Labeling the U.S.-backed 
blockade of food supplies "an act of war," a statement by the Ministry of Labor 
and Social Affairs read over television declared: 
</P>
<P>
"Their share of the food will be affected by the fact that our supplies of food 
are reduced. The right solution is for the embargo to end." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,000 Americans believed to be trapped in Iraq and Kuwait since 
Iraq invaded its tiny neighbor Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the U.N. Security Council unanimously demanded that Iraq let all 
foreigners leave immediately, and the U.S. ambassador accused Baghdad of 
holding them "hostage." (Story, A18) 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush is deeply 
concerned by Iraq's statement and will consider "additional measures" to 
protect foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two days, U.S. and British warships in the Persian Gulf have been 
under orders to block any shipments to Iraq or occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody but the smallest dhow (a fishing boat) could get through the gulf now 
without being questioned," Lt. Cmdr. Jerry Stocker, operations officer of the 
British frigate Jupiter, told reporters in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
The British officer made his remark before the disclosure that American 
frigates had fired warning shots over two Iraqi tankers in the Gulf of Oman and 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein said last week after meeting with President Bush that his 
government would apply U.N. trade sanctions against Iraqi supplies moving by 
land from the Jordanian port of Aqaba, the last open route to Iraq, which 
imports 70% to 75% of its food. But he has been a reluctant supporter of the 
sanctions from the beginning, and U.S. officials privately expressed concern 
that the king may help Iraq obtain basic food and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed by the U.N. Security Council to force an Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait, overrun by President Saddam Hussein's army. The Baghdad 
statement Saturday accused Washington and London of going beyond the sanctions 
by imposing a "military embargo," including food and medicine, and said such an 
embargo is considered an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Hussein has refused to permit about 3,000 Americans, 4,700 
Britons and several thousand other Westerners to leave Iraq or Kuwait. On 
Friday, in a move that suggested they would be held hostage in any attack on 
Iraq, Baghdad said Iraqi and Kuwaiti military and industrial sites -- likely 
targets of an attack -- would be used to house the foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
"The peaceful people of Iraq have realized that only this measure will keep the 
threat of war and aggression at bay and serve the cause of peace," said Sadi 
Mahdi, the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker did not indicate that the hundreds of thousands of Asian and Arab 
imported workers would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
In Maine, President Bush termed the reported dispersal plan "totally 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Said spokesman Fitzwater: "The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote 
what Iraq sees as its self-interest is contrary to international law and indeed 
to all accepted norms of international conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officers last week ordered all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to report 
to two seaside hotels. Initial reports from Kuwait indicated that few Americans 
complied with the order. Washington officials suggested that they would be 
safer staying in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's embattled regime, diplomatically isolated by all but a few Arab 
countries and ringed with a growing Western military force, Saturday reiterated 
its threat to use "weapons of mass destruction," presumably its stockpile of 
chemical bombs and shells, against "anyone who was thinking of aggression and 
turn him into fragments." The threat was published in a government newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
In the last week, the character of the Persian Gulf confrontation has shifted 
to mounting military pressure on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. In the first 
week of the crisis, American-led troop and naval deployments in the region were 
focused on the defense of Saudi Arabia, threatened by the takeover of Kuwait 
and a buildup of Iraqi armored forces near the Saudi border. 
</P>
<P>
It is Hussein and his tight group of top leaders who are now on the defensive, 
lashing out with ominous warnings in the face of superior forces. Saturday, the 
French carrier Clemenceau passed through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea, 
adding to the air armada facing the Iraqis in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials here in the gulf region speak privately in hawkish words. 
"Saddam is finished," said one. "It's just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Iraqi leaders counter with often-hollow military threats. Said 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz of the interdiction patrols in the gulf: 
</P>
<P>
"Measures taken by the United States in obstructing and inspecting Iraqi ships 
represent a precedent that opens the door to whoever is capable of inspecting 
ships of any country. In the future, Arabs will not be less capable than 
others."

SAUDIS WILL PUMP MORE OIL, SUGGEST U.N. MOVES 
</P>

JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With tens of thousands of soldiers already deployed in desert encampments near 
the Kuwait border, a clearly more confident Saudi Arabia called Saturday for 
the United Nations to explore military options against Iraq and said that the 
kingdom is ready to pump an extra 2 million barrels of oil a day to help ease 
international shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Shedding some of the diplomatic caution that has so far hushed the kingdom's 
public response to the Persian Gulf crisis, top Saudi officials declared that 
diplomacy had "failed" to dislodge Iraqi troops from Kuwait and said "the issue 
of peace and war" depends on Iraq's response to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tried in every way possible, through direct contact with the Iraqi 
leadership and multiple contact with other Arab countries, to prevent the 
consequences. We have failed," said Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al 
Faisal. "We have failed for one simple reason, that throughout these efforts 
Iraq has refused . . . a solution to the problem, which is withdrawal from 
Kuwait and restoration of its legitimate leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Any diplomatic contact without these two principles," Faisal added, "is 
diplomatic contact that is doomed to die." 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi foreign minister took note of suggestions by some U.N. members that 
the United Nations go beyond its call for economic sanctions and authorize 
military enforcement of the embargo against Iraqi trade. "We wholeheartedly 
support that action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials called for an immediate meeting of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries to respond to an anticipated worldwide shortfall 
of 4 million barrels of oil a day resulting from an international embargo on 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of the tiny Persian 
Gulf emirate. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir said Saudi Arabia is prepared to pump an extra 
2 million barrels of oil a day if OPEC fails to find some other resolution to 
the shortfall. But OPEC countries are still likely to fall short of meeting the 
worldwide shortage by as much as 1 million barrels a day at current production 
capacity, Nazir said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not necessarily want to take unilateral action. We prefer to go through 
OPEC. But if they refuse to meet, then we have no alternative," the oil 
minister said. "If we discover that there is an obstinate position on the part 
of some of the OPEC countries, we are not going to let the Third World 
countries and other countries go down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials also for the first time declared that Iraq's oil pipeline to 
the kingdom has been shut off, lending official sanction to the effective halt 
in operation of the 979-mile facility since an international trade embargo 
nearly eliminated buyers for Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis, previously reluctant to antagonize Iraq, had not made any official 
announcement earlier, but last week quietly declined to send out tugboats to 
allow two Iraqi tankers to dock at the pipeline loading facility on the Red Sea 
coast at Muajjiz. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, in an unusual, daylong session with American and British 
television networks, newspapers and news agencies, Saudi Oil Minister Nazir 
announced, "The pipeline is closed, and will remain so until the crisis is over 
and the U.N. says so." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Saudi officials admitted that they had been waiting for American and 
Arab troops to move into defensive positions before making any pronouncements 
likely to antagonize Iraq, which has 170,000 troops in Kuwait, many massed near 
the Saudi border. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many Saudis are prepared to take an even harder line. The foreign minister 
asserted that even if Iraq agrees to withdraw from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia will 
demand "international guarantees" to assure that it is a permanent withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Though Saudi Arabia has said it has no desire to interfere in Iraq's internal 
affairs, some officials conceded privately that the guarantee Saudi Arabia most 
wants to see for Kuwait's security is an end to the regime of Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is providing aid to resistance fighters in Kuwait and is also 
supporting efforts by the Kuwaitis to destabilize the government in Iraq, 
including radio broadcasts into Baghdad, said one high-ranking Saudi official. 
</P>
<P>
"The preparedness for such activities are under way," he said. "In our view, if 
Saddam Hussein goes, his system will go with him . . . the whole structure of 
the Baath Party in Iraq will fall." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi intelligence reports for the first time show that tanks and other armored 
vehicles have been deployed along Iraq's border with Saudi Arabia. Previously, 
all military activity had been confined to the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border, and 
Saudi officials have not determined how to interpret the new deployment, which 
one official said is still relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops in Kuwait appeared to be stationed in a large arc beginning at the 
Kuwaiti capital and extending westward and then south toward the Saudi border. 
Most are "dug in" in defensive positions, and the nearest large troop 
concentration is about 25 miles from the Saudi border, said one official. 
However, the Saudis remain alert because Iraq's troops were similarly deployed 
along the Kuwaiti border shortly before the Aug. 2 invasion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials have also detected the movement of large numbers of Iraqi 
troops away from Iraq's border with Iran in the days since Hussein made 
peacemaking overtures to end Iraq's 10-year-old conflict with Iran that halted 
in a grudging cease-fire last year. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence yet to show that troops from the Iranian front have been 
redeployed to the Kuwaiti border, but Saudi intelligence reports do show an 
estimated five or six divisions of Iraqi troops massed at the Iraq-Kuwait 
border near Basra "which can reach us very quickly," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops have been seen in Kuwait with protective gear against chemical 
weapons, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Acting to contain a worldwide pricing spiral that has driven oil prices past 
$28 a barrel, Saudi Arabia has asked for an "immediate" OPEC meeting to resolve 
what Nazir acknowledged is "a destabilized market . . . a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials maintain that the price spirals are a result of "panic pricing" 
but are strongly critical of OPEC's slowness to convene a meeting to discuss a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We honestly don't see how an organization which is in a crisis refuses even to 
meet to discuss the crisis," Nazir said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, currently producing 5.38 million barrels a day, has had requests 
for production of 7.9 million barrels a day in the weeks since the crisis 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Nazir said Saudi Arabia can gear up to meet about half the 
4-million-barrel-a-day shortfall caused by the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to 
the world market. "In a very, very short time, days," Nazir said. Other OPEC 
countries such as Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates can, by Saudi 
estimates, produce an additional 1 million barrels a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, our numbers don't show so far that they can (make up 
the remaining shortfall)," he said. "I'm not so sure they can completely make 
up the shortage."

WILSON'S LETTERS ON BEHALF OF THRIFTS BECOME A CAMPAIGN ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: MANY LEGISLATORS WHO WROTE REGULATORS TO HELP S&amp;LS ARE NOW BEING 
HAUNTED BY THEIR ACTIONS.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a few years ago, Sen. Pete Wilson's efforts to assist California savings 
and loan executives amounted to business as usual in Washington. Like Wilson, 
many members of Congress routinely wrote letters to federal regulators on 
behalf of home state thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed and earlier standards of conduct for members of Congress 
are now being called into question. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, incumbent members of Congress are being forced by their 
political opponents to defend actions -- no matter how small -- that might have 
contributed to the crisis in the nation's savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the political pressures caused by the thrift debacle have grown so 
intense that many politicians -- including some of Wilson's colleagues in the 
Senate -- have returned hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign 
contributions received from savings and loans. This group includes some members 
who have never been directly linked to the thrift scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, the only candidates who got into trouble on this issue were 
those who took specific actions on behalf of savings and loan crooks," said 
Anita Dunn, an official of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. "But now 
many incumbents are being asked: What were you doing while this was going on? 
Why didn't anybody stop it?" 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who received more than $243,000 in contributions from S&amp;L 
executives over the last 10 years, is being accused by Dianne Feinstein, his 
Democratic opponent for governor, of repeatedly contacting federal regulators 
during the mid-1980s on behalf of newly chartered California thrifts that were 
having trouble getting federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are supported by government records obtained from the Office of 
Thrift Supervision. The documents also show that Wilson contacted federal 
regulators on behalf of other thrifts, including one that has given him more 
than $20,000 in campaign contributions, and four that were seized by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has said that he did not pressure federal regulators on behalf of the 
thrift industry. According to his aides, Wilson considered his contacts with 
federal regulators to be routine constituent service. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign manager, said the senator was only inquiring about 
the complaints he had received from thrift executives and that he made no 
effort to force federal regulators to change their policies. 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Carrick, Feinstein's spokesman, said the records demonstrate Wilson 
was "taking an advocacy and lobbying position" on behalf of the thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Wilson's letters to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board were 
remarkable only because the GOP senator -- unlike most members of Congress who 
wrote to the agency -- does not serve on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban 
Affairs Committee, which oversees the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Wilson's letters to thrift regulators were pro forma requests for an 
explanation of the complaints his office had received from executives of 
state-chartered savings and loans that were having trouble getting federal 
deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin J. Gray, who headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board during the 
mid-1980s, recalls that his agency routinely received letters from members of 
Congress who were passing along such complaints. The agency, now known as the 
Office of Thrift Supervision, still has two massive file cabinets full of such 
letters dating back to the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But one of Wilson's letters clearly deviated from that pattern. Unlike the 
other letters, it questioned the agency's general policy and did not mention 
any single thrift. Writing to Gray on Oct. 25, 1984, Wilson said that he shared 
concerns expressed by other members of Congress about the difficulty 
California-chartered thrifts were encountering when they applied for federal 
deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Wilson's letter, the regulators were observing what one official 
described as a de facto moratorium on issuing federal deposit insurance for 
state-chartered thrifts in California. The moratorium had been imposed by Gray, 
who feared that Lawrence Taggart, then California's savings and loan 
commissioner, was chartering too many new thrifts and thus jeopardizing the 
federal deposit insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
During one 400-day period, Taggart had approved 200 applications for state 
charters. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Wilson asked Gray whether he could set up a meeting between 
state and federal regulators to iron out the problem. He also inquired whether 
legislation was needed to improve the oversight process. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gray remembers none of Wilson's other inquiries, he said that he 
recalls receiving the Oct. 25 letter. "My recollection was that I just firmly 
disagreed with him," said Gray, who explained his position in a cordial letter 
to Wilson on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gray, Wilson never pursued the complaint. "I never got a call -- 
never heard from him," Gray said. "There was no intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said that Wilson's action is not comparable to efforts by Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators on behalf of Charles H. Keating 
Jr., owner of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. Gray has accused the 
five senators of improperly trying to influence thrift regulators by summoning 
them to Capitol Hill for a meeting about a lengthy government investigation of 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston, like Wilson, argues that his efforts on behalf of Keating were 
nothing more than legitimate constituent service. In addition, Cranston, who 
serves on the Senate Banking Committee, has accused Gray of partisanship in 
criticizing the thrift-related activities of Democrats in Congress while 
dismissing the conduct of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wilson, Gray is a San Diego Republican. Before he took over the agency 
that regulates savings and loans, he served as a close adviser to Ronald 
Reagan, both during his tenure as governor and during the early years of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The rush to obtain state thrift charters followed a wave of deregulation at the 
state and federal levels that permitted S&amp;L executives to invest large sums 
of federally insured money in risky business ventures. These changes are at the 
heart of the current crisis, which ultimately could cost taxpayers as much as 
$500 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Wilson wrote to Federal Home Loan Bank Board officials on 
eight occasions between October, 1983, and August, 1985, asking the agency to 
review denials of federal insurance to specific state-chartered thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions included City Savings &amp; Loan of Westlake Village, Builders 
Savings &amp; Loan of Long Beach, Diamond Savings of Westminster, Shelter 
Island Savings of La Jolla, Great Fortune Savings of Los Angeles, Bay Savings 
&amp; Loan of Monterey and Alta Savings of Concord. 
</P>
<P>
At least two of the institutions -- Alta and Bay -- already had been denied 
federal insurance and could not operate. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the thrifts that Wilson tried to assist did not contribute to his 
campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records. He did, however, 
receive a $500 contribution from an executive of City Savings &amp; Loan in 
1988 -- four years after he intervened on behalf of the thrift's application 
for federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also wrote to federal regulators on April 10, 1984, on behalf of Great 
Western Savings &amp; Loan, which has contributed generously to his campaign. 
He forwarded a Great Western letter -- which complained that the thrift was not 
receiving enough interest on a loan for real estate that the federal government 
seized in connection with illegal drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Election Commission records show that he has received more than $20,000 
from Great Western's political action committee over the last decade -- $4,300 
in 1982, $2,500 in 1984, $4,000 in 1985, $6,000 in 1986 and $4,000 in 1987. The 
1987 contributions were earmarked for Wilson's 1994 Senate reelection campaign. 
In addition, he has received at least $6,500 in personal contributions from 
Great Western executives during the same period. 
</P>

Wilson's letters to the bank board included three on behalf of thrift 
executives whose institutions already had been seized by the federal government 
-- Hacienda Savings &amp; Loan of Oxnard, San Marino Savings &amp; Loan of San 
Marino and Mt. Whitney Savings &amp; Loan of Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he contacted the agency last April on behalf of Santa Barbara 
Savings, which subsequently was seized by the government. In this letter, he 
passed along a complaint that federal regulators had rejected the thrift's 
reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has no plans to return any of his campaign contributions from savings 
and loan executives. To do so, his aides have said, would be an admission that 
he did something out of the ordinary.

BUSH SIGNS OIL CLEANUP, TANKER BILL SPURRED BY EXXON SPILL

<P>
President Bush on Saturday signed a bill requiring double-hull construction of 
oil tankers and authorizing a $1-billion fund to cover cleanup costs and 
damages not paid by the spiller. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, spurred toward passage by the 11-million-gallon spill by the Exxon 
Valdez in Alaska, also sets new crew licensing and staffing requirements for 
oil ships. 
</P>
<P>
Bush complained that the measure contained a "highly objectionable" moratorium 
on exploration for oil and natural gas off the coast of North Carolina's Outer 
Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a moratorium is ill-advised in view of recent events in the Persian Gulf, 
where I have found it necessary to deploy American soldiers 7,000 miles from 
home to protect our vital national interests," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his Administration would seek repeal of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that gas exploration carries little environmental risk, Bush said: "It 
is shortsighted to restrict exploration for this relatively clean energy 
source." 
</P>
<P>
The President said the $1-billion trust fund will be available to cover cleanup 
costs and damages not compensated by the spiller. However, he said the 
spiller's "financial responsibility requirements are greatly increased." 
</P>
<P>
In another legislative action Saturday, Bush signed a bill to combat AIDS. The 
act authorizes up to $881 million in grants next year, and a total of $4.5 
billion in grants through 1995, for medical assistance in areas with 
disproportionately high numbers of AIDS cases. It is named in honor of Ryan 
White, the late Indiana boy who became a symbol of discrimination against AIDS 
victims.

MOST AMERICANS DISLIKE THEIR LOOKS, POLL FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: SURVEY REPORTS ONLY 30% ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR APPEARANCE, AND 42% SAY 
THEY ARE OVERWEIGHT. ONLY 11% BELIEVE THEY ARE IN 'EXCELLENT' SHAPE.

<P>
Although Americans live in a health-conscious society that often seems obsessed 
with diet and fitness, many are unhappy with their appearance, and only a 
fraction consider themselves in "excellent" physical shape, according to poll 
results released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Most want to lose weight, flatten their stomachs and reduce their waist sizes, 
the survey shows. And women of all ages say they feel more overweight than men 
of the same age. 
</P>
<P>
Those most satisfied with their looks tend to be young, white college graduates 
who exercise at least five hours a week and live in households with annual 
incomes of $50,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings of a survey on health, physical fitness and body 
image conducted by the Times Mirror Center for People &amp; the Press. The 
institute is operated by the Times Mirror Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times 
and other newspaper, broadcasting and publishing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates 
among 1,220 adults during the period of July 12-16. It has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that only 30% of adults are happy with their looks, and 42% say 
they consider themselves overweight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that anyone is ever satisfied," said Tom McDonough, director of 
marketing for the National Wellness Institute, a Wisconsin-based nonprofit 
health education organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an image of our perfect self, and then we have an image of how we see 
ourselves, which is not necessarily the way others see us," McDonough said when 
asked to comment on the report. "Since our perfect image is never realized, I 
think you'll always hear: 'No, I'm not perfect.' But I'm not sure how that 
really translates into true health and wellness." 
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged women and blacks seem prone to putting on excess weight, the poll 
found, while women of all ages -- particularly middle-aged women -- said they 
felt more overweight than men of the same age. Women between the ages of 30 and 
64 were twice as likely to feel overweight than men, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
Only 53% of the respondents thought their weight was about right. That finding 
is similar to a 1987 Harris Poll in which 51% of participants said they thought 
their weight was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
In the new poll, 6% said they were overweight; 13% said they considered 
themselves "somewhat overweight;" and 23% "a little overweight." Only 5% said 
they thought they were underweight. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half the respondents, 53%, described their general health as 
"good." Only 27% called it "excellent," while 15% said it was "fair." Five 
percent said their health was "poor." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly one in four adults said their physical fitness was only "fair," while 
another 6% rated it as "poor." Only 11% described themselves as being in 
"excellent" physical shape. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Tom Baran, a 25-year-old chef from East Hartford, Conn., said he 
spends at least seven hours a week exercising. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm around food all day long, and I don't have a lot of free time," he said. 
"I really work hard trying to stay in shape because I don't want to fall into 
what the typical chef looks like." 
</P>
<P>
While 73% said they believe that exercise can improve their health and extend 
their lives, only 59% said they exercise regularly, a figure virtually 
unchanged from a 1985 poll conducted by the Associated Press. The AP finding 
was 57%. 
</P>
<P>
For those who do exercise, the poll found walking to be the most popular 
activity, with 47% saying they walked for fitness -- a sizable increase from 
the 33% who listed walking as their principal exercise in the 1985 AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
After walking, the list includes aerobics, 24%; running, 19%; weight-lifting, 
17%; bicycling, 15%; exercise machines, 14%; and swimming, 13%. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found walking's popularity highest among people older than 50, with 
74% of older women and 47% of older men saying they walked for exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy it, even though I get tired so quick," said 80-year-old Mary Beard of 
Birmingham, Ala., who recently joined a number of indoor mall walkers to escape 
the Southern heat. "I can't make more than three trips around the mall." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who do not exercise regularly, the most frequent excuse -- 
especially among men -- was that their normal daily activities provide enough 
exercise, the poll found. Women, particularly those with children, said they 
just don't have enough time to work out. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's important, you'll make time," said Joe Henderson, author of the book 
"Total Fitness: Training for Life." "It doesn't take a lot of time to become 
minimally fit, just two hours a week." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who is also the West Coast editor of Runner's World magazine, 
dismissed as "nonsense" the notion that people can get enough exercise through 
their typical daily routines. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from the Midwest, where farmers were supposedly extremely fit because 
they work so hard," he said. "This may have been true a generation ago, but 
today they're driving around in their high-powered pickups and air-conditioned 
tractors. It's still long and tiring work, but it's not very physical. 
</P>
<P>
"If supposedly the most active part of the population is not exercising as part 
of its daily work routine, then those who work in offices certainly aren't," he 
added.

PHILIPPINE VIOLENCE RISES; ARMED FORCES GO ON ALERT

Armed men shot and killed a police officer and four bombings rocked the capital 
before dawn today amid threats of another uprising against President Corazon 
Aquino's government, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 159,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines was placed on maximum alert 
Friday after fugitive army Col. Gregorio Honasan, leader of right-wing rebels, 
announced a resumption of hostilities against Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Capt. Raymundo Venus was riding his motorcycle home Saturday night 
with his daughter on back when two helmeted men on motorcycles shot him in the 
head at close range in suburban Quezon City. 
</P>
<P>
Venus was hit twice and died instantly. His daughter was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Following the killing, a spate of bombings hit a shopping mall in Quezon City, 
the RFM food manufacturing company in suburban Pasig, a police outpost about a 
mile from Aquino's palace and the Department of Justice parking lot in the 
capital's tourist district. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the bombings between 8 p.m. Saturday and 3 a.m. today smashed 
windows and building walls. A security guard was injured at RFM, a company 
owned by the family of Trade Secretary Jose Concepcion. 
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombings. Authorities said the 
"high-explosive" bombs were either hurled by people on foot or riding 
motorcycles or cars. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion, whose offices were bombed last week, said the latest attacks were 
not meant to "harm but to make the perpetrators know they are around." 
</P>
<P>
"If they think they can scare us we'd like to let them know we will continue 
doing our job," said Justice Secretary Franklin Drillon. His office is 
prosecuting rebel soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Honasan, 41, led last December's coup attempt in which 119 people were killed 
and more than 500 were wounded. He said last week that "tactical operations" 
would resume after his reconciliation offer was spurned.

U.S. helicopters evacuated 825 foreigners from Monrovia on Saturday in the 
biggest airlift out of Liberia's war-torn capital in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said 550 of those flown to four U.S. warships offshore were 
Lebanese. They were to be flown today to Freetown, the capital of neighboring 
Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi was among the other nationalities evacuated by the United States, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A Middle East Airlines Boeing 707 also flew into Freetown on Saturday to fetch 
a first batch of 200 Lebanese evacuees and take them back to the relative 
safety of Beirut. Lebanese officials said the airliner brought a medical team 
to handle any ill or injured people. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, U.S. helicopters have pulled nearly 1,500 foreigners 
out of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred more Lebanese, including Beirut's ambassador, were to leave 
Monrovia today in a road convoy headed east for the Ivory Coast. They were 
trapped in an eastern suburb of Monrovia, the capital, controlled by Charles 
Taylor's rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting prevented them from reaching Mamba Point, where the U.S. Embassy is 
located and where troops of Taylor's rival, Prince Johnson, hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Arnold Quainoo of Ghana, who heads a multinational African peacekeeping 
force marshaling in Freetown, met chiefs of staff Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He told them that "effective execution of our mission depends on one main 
principle, positive neutrality. We must do nothing to suggest that we are 
taking sides. The political situation in Liberia has to be resolved by the 
people of Liberia." 
</P>
<P>
The force of about 3,000 men includes troops from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, 
Sierra Leone, Togo and Gambia and was organized by the Economic Community of 
West African States. 
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force will try to impose a cease-fire between troops of 
President Samuel K. Doe, holding out in central Monrovia, and the rival 
factions of Taylor and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor opposes foreign intervention in the eight-month civil war, but Quainoo 
said he would fly to the Gambian capital of Banjul on Monday to meet with 
Taylor to urge him to agree to a cease-fire and to allow the peacekeeping force 
to police Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force has invited Liberian political leaders to Banjul on Aug. 
27 to discuss formation of an interim government that would organize elections 
within 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
African diplomats said the force is likely to move into Liberia before then, 
whether or not Quainoo gets Taylor to agree to a cease-fire. Doe and Johnson 
already have accepted the principle of a truce. 
</P>
<P>
Quainoo flew to Banjul earlier in the week in an unsuccessful attempt to meet 
with Taylor, who did not show up after a report by his National Patriotic Front 
of Liberia that he had been slightly hurt in a car accident.

226 SOVIETS GET A SMOOTH ESCORT OUT OF KUWAIT; 
</P>
<P>
EVACUATION: THE TRIP WAS HOT BUT WELL-ORGANIZED, THEY SAY. IRAQI SOLDIERS 
REPORTEDLY TREATED THEM WELL.

<P>
After a smooth journey that might have resembled a guided tour if not for the 
Iraqi military escort, the first 226 Soviet evacuees from Kuwait flew back to 
the motherland on Saturday, unshaven, travel-worn and marveling at the ease of 
their exit. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to harrowing tales of rape and robbery by escaped Westerners, the 
returnees said Iraqi soldiers had never failed to treat them with respect -- 
and had even speeded their way by helping them jump the lines at crammed gas 
pumps and at the border crossing into Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful," engineer Vadim P. Danilov said, reassuring a group of 
relatives still hopefully awaiting passengers in the arrival area of the Moscow 
airport. "They escorted us to the border, and we didn't have to wait for 
formalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was very good. The Iraqi order doesn't allow foreigners leaving the 
country to take their belongings, but our representative persuaded them to let 
ours go," Danilov said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the VIP treatment given the first planeload of returnees from Kuwait, 
it was unclear how the 8,000 Soviet nationals in Iraq itself would be affected 
by the potential hostage crisis surrounding Americans and other foreign 
residents. Soviet officials have said that women and children have been granted 
permission to leave Iraq, but some 5,000 Soviet men are being held there, and 
their fate is still under negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television on Saturday condemned the Iraqi detention of foreigners and 
threats to use them as shields to prevent attacks on key military and 
industrial targets. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire of the Iraqi military clique to hide behind the backs of unarmed 
civilians who have been turned into hostages arouses indignation," an anchorman 
on the nightly news said. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, asked to react to reported Iraqi threats 
against foreigners, said only that if they were serious, it would be a cause 
for worry. 
</P>
<P>
"This will probably become another reason for concern over the further 
development of events in the region," the unidentified spokesman told the 
state-run news agency Tass. "We realize that the point in question is the 
safety of thousands of people, and the possibility of actions from both sides 
that could lead to another escalation of tension." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the oil workers and their families who left the Ilyushin 86 that rolled 
into Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on a special flight from Jordan had a tired 
but nonchalant air that contrasted with the jumpy nerves of the relatives who 
met them with flowers and embraces. 
</P>
<P>
"It was safe," said Valery Mayer, 42, who worked as an engineer at a Kuwaiti 
gas-processing plant. "We heard very little gunfire, and mostly at night. The 
Iraqis treated us with respect. There was no fear they would touch us." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Ludmila, who flew 1,300 miles from their home in the oil-rich Tyumen 
region to meet him, said she had been so anxious about Valery's safety that it 
had been "dangerous" to her health to watch coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis 
on television. 
</P>
<P>
But Danilov said, "The situation is quiet in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Other evacuees said their journey's only real difficulty was the suffocating 
heat in the buses that took them the 1,120 miles from Kuwait to Baghdad to 
Amman. 
</P>
<P>
Danilov said the schedule of departures for Soviet citizens was carefully 
worked out and meals and cargo transport were well organized, with local 
authorities leasing out additional buses, helping with vehicle repairs and 
providing a military escort as far as the Iraqi-Jordanian border. 
</P>
<P>
The buses had to stop often in the 110-degree swelter to cool their engines, he 
said. But when they reached gas stations crammed with thousands of fleeing 
motorists, "we were refueled ahead of the line because of Iraqi policy." 
</P>
<P>
"The organization of the escort was perfect," construction worker Alexander 
Kell said. "There were no delays."

"We're too far out in front of the rest of the company," the sergeant says. 
"They could be firing and killing us." 
</P>
<P>
The shovels are put away, rucksacks are quickly packed and the platoon within 
minutes makes a short retreat, guided to a new site by a dim fluorescent signal 
flashed by a sister platoon several hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Platoon 22 -- the second platoon of the 82nd Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade -- 
digs in again. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, the company commander explains to a reporter that the 
platoon had taken position far enough out front to be hit by friendly mortar 
and machine gun fire. The captain isn't happy, but shrugs it off. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our newest platoon leader," he says. "It's good to get him out here to 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's exercises gave the troops a chance to practice on the first 
night that the Saudi government allowed American troops to train long after 
sundown. More such drills, including some joint exercises with Saudi troops, 
are planned. 
</P>
<P>
The first night of desert training, witnessed by two reporters and a 
photographer, demonstrated the formidable challenges American forces would face 
in a desert war in the Middle East. And it provided journalists the first 
chance to spend extended time with some of the young men who would fight that 
war. 
</P>
<P>
They are a diverse group from throughout America -- some eager to fight, some 
terrified by the prospect. But all share a similar hope that the crisis will 
soon be resolved, either through combat or diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here sweating because our lives may depend on it," said one private who 
carried a 50-pound pack through 95-degree evening heat. "But it's really not up 
to us. Our lives are in the politicians' hands." 
</P>
<P>
The sun was just beginning its descent when the three platoons began the 
exercise, walking in a V-shaped formation roughly three miles into the 
seemingly endless Arabian desert. As the sun dropped off the horizon, a herd of 
camels traipsed past the curious Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The need to carry more water makes the soldiers' packs extra heavy. During a 
break, a 20-year-old medic from Newburgh, N.Y., lightens his pack a bit by 
taking a few gulps. The infantrymen he is there to help drop into a circular 
perimeter, their weapons aimed across the darkening terrain. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding the courage is tough -- it's scary out here," the medic says. "But 
you've got to swallow that and go out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Inside his bag are needles with antidotes to certain chemical weapons; the 
medic prays they will not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to go back to the States and be with our kids," he says. 
</P>
<P>
None of a dozen soldiers interviewed under the sparkling desert sky has any 
idea when the trip home will be. Some ask aloud whether they will make it. Most 
hope diplomacy convinces Iraq to leave Kuwait; a few would rather take on 
Saddam Hussein's forces now. 
</P>
<P>
"If it would get us home faster, then let's go kick him out of Kuwait," one 
private says. "What we have now is hurry up and wait. It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
It is so dark that one can move around virtually unnoticed; so quiet that 
whispers can be heard. Much of the talk is idle chatter. 
</P>
<P>
"The sky is just like the sky back home," one soldier says to his companion in 
a two-man foxhole. 
</P>
<P>
The response: "But it just isn't the same unless I'm sitting out on my back 
porch." 
</P>
<P>
A few yards away, another soldier tells a passerby: "My wife is having our baby 
in five weeks. I wish I could just say hello." 
</P>
<P>
A radioman with the medic begins a sentence saying, "If Saddam doesn't pull out 
of Kuwait. . . ." The medic completes the thought, " . . . he'll be squished 
like a grape." 
</P>
<P>
The men are barely in their foxholes when they are instructed to head back to 
their transport trucks, a nearly three-mile walk in the pitch-black night. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the back of the line can see the shadows of just the few men ahead. In 
training, one sergeant says, soldiers have been known to stop, thinking a tree 
several feet ahead in the darkness is the man they are supposed to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"That cuts you off from the front," he says. "And if you get cut off, you die." 
</P>
<P>
The Saudi desert has no trees, but the going is treacherous in the dark because 
of short, sharp shrubs underfoot and small dunes that turn a walk to a stumble. 
</P>
<P>
During the trek, most of the soldiers say they understand that they must be 
here and are ready to fight to defend the Saudi kingdom. These are the troops 
-- airborne paratroopers -- who arrived first, when there was little firepower 
to back them up. 
</P>
<P>
"When they called us out, we thought we were going to drop right into a war," 
the medic says. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters on night flights pass in the distance, a reminder that much more 
U.S. firepower is in the region now. 
</P>
<P>
As they wait, the 82nd Airborne forces train about 12 hours a day. They have 
some complaints -- the lack of mail is the biggest -- but say morale is high. 
They complain largely because there is little else to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Army tradition," one sergeant says with a laugh. "But we're fine." 
</P>
<P>
A reporter keeps asking what it would be like to fight in the desert. The 
soldiers keep asking what it's like back home. 
</P>
<P>
"Please tell them we'll be back," a lieutenant says. "We just don't know when."

15 SHIITE TERRORISTS ESCAPED FROM KUWAIT JAIL, EX-INMATE CLAIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
A Lebanese Shiite Muslim who claims he escaped from prison in Kuwait during 
Iraq's invasion said Saturday that 15 convicted terrorists linked to kidnapers 
in Lebanon also fled from jail. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, unconfirmed reports speculated that the 15 had been taken to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
A pro-Iranian Shiite faction in Lebanon, Islamic Jihad, which has been holding 
Americans Terry A. Anderson and Thomas Sutherland for more than five years, had 
demanded the release of the 15 prisoners in return for freeing the two 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese who said he escaped, Abdulaziz Krayyem, said he was imprisoned in 
1985 on charges of cooperating with the 15, mostly Iraqi Shiites, who were 
convicted in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait as 
well as Kuwaiti installations. 
</P>
<P>
Krayyem said he was among 1,600 prisoners who overpowered their guards and 
escaped when they heard about the invasion. He said the 15 were among those who 
got out. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them climbing into taxicabs with Kuwaiti plate numbers," which then sped 
away, Krayyem said. "That's all I saw." 
</P>
<P>
However, the report could not be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
Krayyem said he has no idea of the current whereabouts of the 15. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hid out for 10 days with Kuwaiti inmates who got their families to 
collect them after the jailbreak. The Lebanese Embassy issued a new passport 
for him, and he joined a car convoy sponsored by the embassy that passed 
through Saudi Arabia, then Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Krayyem, 35, arrived Friday in his hometown of Yater, 56 miles south of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Krayyem said "chaos broke out immediately" after Kuwaiti prison guards told the 
inmates about the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"The prisoners started shouting at the guards," he said. "The guards fired at 
them, killing an Iraqi and an Afghan prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
"After a few hours of fighting with the guards, the prisoners were able to 
occupy the prison and overthrow the guards."

F-15 SALES TO SAUDIS MAY AID MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. sale of the advanced version of F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia 
would provide at least a modest boost to some defense contractors, particularly 
ailing St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, which has said it will eliminate 
17,000 jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is expected to work out details of the sale, 
involving 24 F-15 Eagles, during his current visit to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon would most likely make the sale from its current stockpile, but 
McDonnell Douglas would have the opportunity to win an extended contract to 
provide replacement aircraft, said Michael Beltramo, a defense-industry 
management consultant in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
An advantage of an extended contract, he said, is that the F-15 "is the most 
mature" aircraft. Unlike some newer, riskier programs, the manufacturer 
understands better "what the costs and risks are" in producing the aircraft. 
McDonnell Douglas' experience means that "each aircraft (under an extended 
contract) will add a profit to their bottom line," he added. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas spokesman Jim Reed declined to speculate on what effect a 
sale to the Saudis would have on the company. Any increased production of the 
fighter -- which is manufactured at the company's St. Louis facilities -- would 
not affect layoffs announced this year, he said. The company announced the job 
cuts -- including 9,000 in Southern California -- as part of a plan to cut 
costs by $700 million to improve its profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the federal government has funded the F-15 program through the fiscal 
1991 year. McDonnell Douglas is slated to produce about 24 fighters this year 
under its contract, he said. He declined to say what F-15's cost is, but some 
analysts said the government's cost may be as high as $50 million for each 
fighter, including the total equipment that must be added. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has a current inventory of 800 to 850 fighters, Beltramo said. 
</P>
<P>
The F-15 Eagle is the most sophisticated version of the fighter plane. That 
version has never been sold to the Saudis although they have purchased the 
F-15C and the F-15D. The Reagan Administration considered selling the advanced 
F-15 to the Saudis about five years ago, but abandoned it because of an 
expected bitter fight with a Congress concerned that the sale would endanger 
Israel.

SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDS IRAQ LET FOREIGNERS LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an urgent late-night session held at the urging of the United States, the 
United Nations Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved a resolution 
demanding that Iraq permit the immediate departure of the thousands of 
foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, the fourth aimed at Iraq by the 15-nation body since Iraqi 
troops invaded Kuwait earlier this month, also demanded that Iraq do nothing to 
jeopardize the safety or health of the foreigners and that consular officials 
be allowed to see them. 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council acted on the measure after announcements by the Iraqi 
government that it was detaining Westerners until the threat of war was over 
and that those detained, including infants and elderly people, would be denied 
food and medical supplies unless the United States and its allies lifted its 
blockade and permitted such items through. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that detained Westerners would be kept at key military and civilian 
installations until the danger of war was over. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dismayed and revolted by these actions," Thomas R. Pickering, the 
American ambassador to the United Nations, said in remarks to the Security 
Council after the 15-to-0 vote was taken. Iraq had "crossed the Rubicon" by 
daring to take such steps, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pickering accused Iraq of holding thousands of foreigners "hostage," 
using a term U.S. officials previously had avoided in referring to those being 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 Americans and 4,000 Britons are in Kuwait and more than 500 
Americans and 700 Britons are in Iraq. In addition, thousands of other foreign 
nationals have been barred from leaving those two countries since the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The latest resolution also reaffirmed a previous resolution declaring Iraq's 
annexation of Kuwait as null and void, and it demanded that Iraq rescind its 
order for the closing of embassies and consulates in Kuwait and for the 
withdrawal of immunity for diplomatic personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Also, under the resolution, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar was 
asked to pursue "urgent consultations" with the Iraqi government to ensure 
"full and immediate compliance" with the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar was on a trip to Latin America but planned to send 
representatives to Baghdad. They are Undersecretary General Virendra Dayal, an 
Indian who heads the secretary general's executive office, and Undersecretary 
General Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian who is controller in the U.N. program planning, 
budget and finance office. 
</P>
<P>
Yemen, the only Arab nation sitting on the Security Council, voted for the 
resolution but urged the lifting of the embargo of foodstuffs to Iraq, 
contending that this would be not only a humanitarian step but also would lead 
to a reduction of tensions in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Action on the resolution came after more than four hours of closed-door 
consultations involving member nations of the Security Council along with 
representatives of Iraq and Kuwait.

CRISIS IN THE GULF: HOW IT ALL STARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late July: George Steinbrenner is still running the Yankees, the governor of 
Louisiana is deciding whether to veto an abortion bill and the American press 
seems bent on finding out just what David Souter, nominee for the Supreme 
Court, thinks about abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Americans pay much attention to the quarrel between Iraq and its little 
neighbor, Kuwait. It seemed like just another of those wrangles over oil 
pricing that occur before the meetings of OPEC sheiks and statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rumblings were to suddenly put the United States on war footing in the 
searing Saudi desert. Here's how it happened: 
</P>
<P>
 July 17: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, facing an oil glut and declining 
revenues, takes aim at Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which had been 
exceeding OPEC oil production quotas by more than a million barrels a day. 
Hussein demands that the two nations pay $14 billion to compensate for what he 
says Iraq lost due to low oil prices. And he tells Kuwait that it must forgive 
$15 billion in loans extended during the Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
July 18: Hussein's foreign minister accuses Kuwait of having stolen $2.4 
billion worth of Iraqi petroleum over the past decade. Kuwait puts its 
20,000-man army on alert. 
</P>
<P>
July 19: Kuwait cancels its state of alert. "It was all a summer cloud that has 
been blown away," says an unidentified Kuwaiti source who turns out to be 
monumentally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
July 23: Reports say that Iraq has massed 30,000 troops at its border and that 
U.S. warships in the gulf have been put on alert. 
</P>
<P>
July 24: Kuwait reinstates its alert. The Pentagon announces naval exercises in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
July 27: At a tense meeting in Geneva, OPEC agrees to limit oil production and 
raise its target price by $3 to $21 a barrel. Kuwait and the Emirates promise 
to abide by the new production quotas. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the House and Senate defy Bush Administration opposition and 
vote for economic sanctions against Iraq. These reflect an accumulation of 
complaints over Iraq's attempt to intimidate neighbors, its human rights 
record, its use of poison gas and its drive to build nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 1: Delegations from Iraq and Kuwait meet in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to 
discuss their differences. The Iraqis walk out, saying they did not sense "any 
seriousness" from the Kuwaitis. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 2: A massive Iraqi invasion force crosses into Kuwait, expelling the 
government and taking control of the oil-rich state. The action ultimately 
leads to the largest U.S. military dispatch since the Vietnam War.

The Khmer Rouge guerrilla group rejected a 12-point Vietnamese proposal for 
free elections in Cambodia, saying it was simply meant to preserve the 
Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh. Hanoi's proposal, put forward in 
talks with the United States earlier this month, is supposed to guarantee free 
and fair elections as the key to ending more than 11 years of conflict in 
Cambodia. But the essence of the proposal calls for elections to be held under 
the existing government, thereby allowing Vietnam to control the process.

<P>
The pilot of an ultralight solar airplane making a cross-country journey was 
forced to make his second emergency landing because of unfavorable conditions, 
a spokesman said. Eric Raymond took off in his Sun-Seeker aircraft at 12:15 
p.m. CDT Friday from Clinton, Mo., spokesman Jack Whitehouse said. 
</P>
<P>
His flight lasted less than three hours and covered 42 miles. Raymond was 
forced to land in a grass field in Deepwater, Mo., because weak thermals would 
not lift the plane over the Harry S. Truman Reservoir, Whitehouse said. 
Whitehouse has tracked Raymond's flight from the California airfield where it 
began Aug. 2. The plane has been grounded for four days during the two weeks 
because of insufficient thermals. Raymond had hoped to reach his final 
destination of Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Sunday -- in celebration of National 
Aviation Day, Whitehouse said.

Authorities have decided a broken back is punishment enough and will not file 
charges against a man who parachuted from an unfinished high-rise. John Carta, 
44, a former Green Beret whose hobby is parachuting from skyscrapers and 
bridges, fractured his back in three places when his parachute failed Thursday.

CASUALTY OF PERSIAN GULF ACTION IS EULOGIZED; 
</P>
<P>
FUNERAL: AIR FORCE STAFF SGT. JOHN FRANCIS CAMPISI OF WEST COVINA IS REMEMBERED 
AS A PEACEMAKER BY FRIENDS.

<P>
Friends and family gathered Saturday in West Covina at an emotional funeral 
service for Air Force Staff Sgt. John Francis Campisi, the first U.S. 
serviceman to die in the Persian Gulf since the current troop buildup began. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300 mourners heard Campisi remembered as a peacemaker and a career 
serviceman who was willing to make sacrifices for his family, friends and 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime friend, fellow altar boy and parochial schoolmate Mark Rizkowsky, 30, 
of Ontario recalled Campisi as "the one we always called peacemaker." Rizkowsky 
fought back tears as he spoke of his close friendship with Campisi. "No matter 
where he was stationed, we always kept in touch." 
</P>
<P>
Rizkowsky added that Campisi did not die in vain. "John died for a reason, a 
reason that meant a lot to John and to all of us. . . . So that his, mine and 
all our children may never have to fight in a war. They can always live in 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour funeral Mass at St. Christopher Catholic Church, Msgr. 
Helmet Hefner told mourners that Campisi's death serves as a "very real and 
concrete sign" of the sacrifices soldiers make. 
</P>
<P>
"There's certainly a great sacrifice involved in young people leaving their 
families, friends and going across seas to desert sands to defend ideals of 
freedom and justice," Hefner said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the pain and destruction of war, Hefner expressed hope that others, 
including the 50,000 American troops already stationed in the Persian Gulf, 
would not have to die in the standoff with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the pain of John Campisi's family will not be repeated," he said. "We 
must realize the cost of war. We must not let some madman (Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein) who cries out for a Holy War, as if war could be ever holy, stampede 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Another friend of Campisi's, for nearly 25 years, David Saldana, 30, of West 
Covina told the congregation: "I don't consider myself lucky (to have known 
Campisi), I consider myself blessed. The miles could never separate us and 
neither will his passing." 
</P>
<P>
Campisi, 30, was hit by a truck and killed Aug. 12 -- three weeks before his 
31st birthday -- on a darkened aircraft runway in Saudi Arabia, five days after 
the first U.S. troops set up operations in the country. Pentagon sources have 
said that Campisi may have been wearing protective ear gear and failed to hear 
the oncoming vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
After the Mass, the ceremony continued under hazy skies at the Queen of Heaven 
Cemetery in Rowland Heights. An Air Force honor guard performed a traditional 
21-gun salute while six military pallbearers and four flag bearers stood at 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
After a bugler played "Taps," the American flag draped over the airman's casket 
was neatly folded and presented to Campisi's wife, Charlene, who cried silently 
with her eldest daughter and youngest son at her side. Another flag was 
presented to Campisi's mother. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife of 11 years, Campisi leaves four children: Anna, 9, 
John, Jr., 8, Chris, 7, and Jennifer, 4. His parents, Salvatore and Marjorie 
Campisi, live in West Covina where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
Campisi served as an aircraft maintenance technician and had been in the Air 
Force since he was 18. Before his duty in the Middle East, Campisi lived with 
his family at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Campisi also leaves a sister and three brothers. One of the brothers is a Navy 
chief petty officer and another recently enlisted in the Navy.

CITIES EXPAND THEIR RECYCLING ROLES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SIX COMMUNITIES NOW PICK UP RECYCLABLES AT THE CURB. BUT THE 
FLURRY OF ACTIVITY HAS SET THE STAGE FOR TRASH TURF WARS COUNTYWIDE. 
</P>

<P>
Spurred by a five-year state deadline to reduce trash by 25%, six of Ventura 
County's 10 cities now pick up at least a portion of their residents' 
recyclables at the curb, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The programs by Ventura, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula, Fillmore and 
Ojai divert about 750 tons a week from rapidly filling county landfills. 
Oxnard, which already recycles about 50 tons a week through a program for 
businesses, will decide Tuesday whether to move ahead with a 3,000-home 
curbside pilot program for residences in December. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark could have a program for 500 homes by next month, but Camarillo and 
Port Hueneme are still in planning stages for curbside programs, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City-sponsored programs to pick up bottles, cans, cardboard and newspapers at 
curbside are convenient for residents and popular politically, officials say. 
But they bring contention as well. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of recycling activities -- the result of legislation known as AB 939 
requiring cities to reduce trash sent to landfills 25% by 1995 and 50% by the 
year 2000 -- sets the stage for trash turf skirmishes countywide. 
</P>
<P>
Cities may line up against a regional agency for control of the trash, and 
private trash haulers against private recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Smith, senior vice president at Simi Valley's GI Industries, which 
hauls rubbish for four east county cities and operates a recycling processing 
center, said Ventura County should meet the state mandates with no problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our county is going to be way ahead of the rest of the state in 
meeting our 939 goals," Smith said of the state's legislation. "The haulers are 
doing all they can and the cities like to be involved because it's great for 
them politically." 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley and Ventura, the two cities considered the front-runners in 
county recycling, private processing centers sort and ship recyclables to 
markets around the state, country and world. Ventura's Intermediate Processing 
Center, operated by Gold Coast Recycling, is by far the most sophisticated in 
the county with its indoor operation and state-of-the art machinery, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura curbside recycling program, which reroutes about 300 tons of trash 
a week into the recycling center, costs Ventura about $500,000 annually, but 
it's well worth the money, said Terry Adelman, the city finance director who 
heads the city's recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's doing the right thing for the county and the environment," said Adelman, 
who has dubbed himself the "director of cash and trash." "It's keeping trash 
out of the landfill that only has three years left, and it will be cheaper in 
the long run than using a landfill." 
</P>
<P>
As the amount of recyclables handled goes up, the fixed costs of buildings and 
machinery go down, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley is setting up recycling bins in six shopping centers and plans to 
open a drop-off center for paints, motor oil and other household hazardous 
wastes this fall, in addition to a citywide curbside program. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, Fillmore, Santa Paula and Thousand Oaks have begun an 
innovative program in conjunction with the Ventura Regional Sanitation District 
that mixes yard cuttings with sewage sludge to produce a soil fertilizer. The 
Regional Sanitation District uses the mixture to help its landscaping at the 
closed Coastal landfill. 
</P>
<P>
e district, a nonprofit public agency directed by a board of representatives 
from western Ventura County cities, operates landfills at Oxnard and Toland 
Road between Fillmore and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
As the successes of recycling programs countywide continue to mount, so does 
the competition for contracts and trash. 
</P>
<P>
Two processing center operators -- Gold Coast in Ventura and GI Industries in 
Simi Valley -- want to build plants in the east county to handle recyclables 
collected in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and the Santa Rosa 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Gold Coast, which already receives recyclables at its Ventura facility 
from Ventura, Oxnard, Fillmore and Santa Paula, is negotiating with the city of 
Camarillo and plans to approach Port Hueneme, Gold Coast Manager Chris R. Webb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Regional Sanitation District, which will have only the small Toland 
Road landfill left after the Bailard landfill in Oxnard closes in 1993, also 
plans its own processing center. It is in the midst of a years-long planning 
process to build a center in Saticoy or Oxnard that is bigger than that of Gold 
Coast or GI Industries. The Regional Sanitation District's center, which 
officials hope will open in 1993, could serve Camarillo, Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme, said Resource Recovery Manager Mike Ewens. 
</P>
<P>
It was originally designed to serve the city of Ventura as well, but the city 
beat the sanitation district to the punch. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to work with Regional Sanitation," Ventura Finance Director Adelman 
said. But the district was unwilling to pursue the necessary county permits to 
operate a sorting center at its Bailard landfill in Oxnard, and the city wanted 
to begin working toward the state-mandated goal to reduce its 1,750 tons of 
trash a week to 1,312 tons a week. With about 300 tons a week diverted now, the 
city is on its way, Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, Regional Sanitation is still talking about it," Adelman said. 
"It might have been a little embarrassing, but we had to get on line." 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the pile in the battle over bottles, cans, paper and cardboard 
is the private recycler, area businesses say. 
</P>
<P>
With city contracts that guarantee Gold Coast and GI Industries a certain 
profit, the cities are subsidizing two private companies and making it 
difficult for a small-potatoes recycler to turn a buck, said Wade Schlosser, 
president of the privately owned Simi Valley Recycling. 
</P>
<P>
With their earnings guaranteed, Gold Coast and GI Industries can unload their 
products at a price that ruins the market, Schlosser said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to them if they make a profit or not," Schlosser said. "All 
they understand is whatever they get stuck with, they will pass the cost on to 
somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Schlosser and other recyclers, on the other hand, have to bear the costs of the 
changing markets for recycled materials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cities should have chosen longtime recycling companies for 
their processing contracts instead of two companies associated with rubbish 
haulers, Schlosser said. 
</P>
<P>
GI Industries has trash-hauling contracts in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and 
Moorpark, while Harrison and Sons, a part owner in Gold Coast, hauls trash in 
Ventura and other western county cities. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to recycle, why not go to someone who's been in the business for 
10 years, not some garbage company that learned about recycling yesterday," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Murphy, owner of D&amp;J Recycling in Ventura, said he fears that Gold 
Coast will eventually open a so-called buyback center to the public, in which 
individuals trade their recyclables for cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there are four recyclers in Ventura and that would hurt us all," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Coast Manager Webb acknowledged that the city guarantees a certain level 
of profit, but said the company has $3 million invested in the center and a 
limited time to make it profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"Our contract says when the Regional Sanitation District facility comes on 
line, we either will sell out to them or we'll go out of business," he said. 
"We won't compete. That was the business risk we had to take to get the 
contract." 
</P>
<P>
Ewens at Regional Sanitation District said markets for selling the recycled 
goods, especially newspapers, should stay soft through the next few years until 
new and expanded paper mills become operational. 
</P>
<P>
But Jocelyn Reed, deputy director of environmental services in Simi Valley, 
said the efforts of private and public recyclers alike all contribute to the 
ultimate goal: reducing the trash dumped in landfills countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"This recycling process is a kind of countywide effort," she said. "We're all 
learning from each other."

STIGMA OF ANCIENT DISEASE EXACTS BIG TOLL ON ITS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary is determined not to cry as she talks about Hansen's disease, but she 
keeps a box of tissues nearby, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
Her condition, commonly known as leprosy, is not life-threatening. When 
treated, it is not contagious and has few visible symptoms, if any. But, since 
the 53-year-old Filipino immigrant's illness was diagnosed nearly two years 
ago, she has discovered another common side effect: fear of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
That fear is the reason she lies to her co-workers at a San Diego sporting 
goods company, explaining away the small dark spots on her face and arms as 
"allergies." That same fear makes Mary ask a reporter not to print her real 
name and keeps her from telling her sister, who has a "weak heart," about her 
battle with a disease that fills most people with dread. 
</P>
<P>
"You become an outcast -- in the Philippines, you sure are one if you have 
this," the tiny, dark-haired woman said recently, her delicate fingers folding 
and unfolding a tissue. "I have to tell a lie. It's not that I am ashamed. But 
I would like to protect my family. Nobody wants to have this." 
</P>
<P>
Mary is among a growing number of people -- nearly 160 in all -- who are 
fighting age-old stigmas at the Regional Hansen's Disease Center in Pacific 
Beach. Housed in the county's North San Diego Public Health Center, the 
federally funded program is among 11 in the country established to care for 
Hansen's patients -- many of them Hispanic, Filipino or Southeast Asian 
immigrants -- and their families. In the United States, Hansen's disease -- 
named for Armauer Hansen, a Norwegian physician who discovered its cause in 
1873 -- remains quite rare. Only 6,000 of the world's 10 million known cases 
live in this country, mainly in California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, New 
York and Texas. But, in San Diego, as in other regional centers in Los Angeles 
and San Francisco, the influx of immigrants from Mexico, Indochina and the 
Philippines continues to cause the caseload to swell. 
</P>
<P>
That expansion comes despite the fact that Hansen's disease, a bacterial 
infection that attacks the skin and nerves, is often mistaken for other things, 
from birthmarks to lupus. Because U.S. doctors rarely encounter the illness, 
many are unfamiliar with its symptoms -- usually skin lesions and sensory loss. 
As a result, the average patient sees several doctors over about two years 
before getting an accurate diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego clinic has two goals: In addition to providing medical care and 
counseling to patients in treatment, the four-person staff tries to increase 
medical professionals' "index of suspicion" about the disease so that new cases 
are detected sooner. And, although it can't change the world overnight, the 
staff encourages patients to start by erasing the word leper from their own 
vocabularies. 
</P>
<P>
"Leper is like nigger -- educated people should not use the word," said Dr. D. 
A. Lopez, a dermatologist and associate clinical professor at UCSD who has 
provided care to the area's Hansen's patients since 1974. "It's a type of 
phobia that society has. But (the word) does not describe the patient today." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lopez explains, the legendary deformities of Hansen's disease are 
completely preventable. Only 5% of the population is susceptible in the first 
place. And, for those who do get it, modern drugs can render the disease 
non-contagious, eliminating the need to separate people from their families in 
colonies, or leprosariums. Today, Lopez insists, virtually the only things that 
prevent people with Hansen's disease from leading normal lives are society's 
misconceptions -- and their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Leprosy is not a threat to San Diego," said Lopez, a retired Navy captain who 
first encountered the disease when he was assigned to the Navy Hospital in 
Balboa Park. "In reality, there's nothing to fear from these people. They're 
innocent victims caught between the germ and the body defenses. Their nerves 
get caught in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Meredith, a North County resident in her 70s, remembers how frightened she was 
the day she bumped her leg against the sharp corner of a piece of furniture -- 
and couldn't feel it. Born in the United States, she was not a high-risk 
candidate for Hansen's disease. But she had recently been ill -- her weakened 
system was the perfect host for an opportunistic infection. What's more, over 
her lifetime she had lived off and on in an Asian country where she had had 
contact with Hansen's patients. 
</P>
<P>
Meredith, who also asked that her real name not be revealed, immediately 
suspected what doctors would later confirm. But she caught her Hansen's early, 
started immediate treatment and avoided visible symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to the clinic, there's really nothing to worry about," she says now. 
In Asia, she recalled, "Some people really did suffer -- open sores, they 
couldn't walk, their feet were bad. But it never needs to get that way." 
</P>
<P>
Finding treatment is the first hurdle. Keeping a positive outlook throughout 
what can be years of treatment is another. Despite the medical breakthroughs 
that address the physical symptoms, a diagnosis of Hansen's takes a 
psychological toll. Some patients try to deny the problem, quitting their 
medicines at the first sign of improvement. Others are tightly wound with fear. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Frank, the center's senior public health nurse, remembers one man who was 
improving, but for one thing: at the clinic, his blood pressure was always 
sky-high. When measured at home, however, it was normal. Finally, he admitted 
that visiting the clinic sent him into a tailspin -- he was terrified that he 
would run into someone he knew. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some Hansen's patients opt to keep the condition secret, even from 
their spouses. For them, especially, the clinic becomes a vital part of 
survival. There, they can share their frustrations with the medicines, which 
often darken the skin. They can air their guilt and anger, or rehearse what to 
say to a loved one learning about Hansen's for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
As well as prescriptions, Frank makes sure the clinic dispenses plenty of 
physical affection, from handshakes to hugs. Many Hansen's patients feel 
unlovable, betrayed by their bodies, she explains -- especially those who have 
lost sensation (usually in the hands and feet) before treatment began. 
</P>
<P>
"We think pain is the enemy. But they get no input. Their self-image is lost," 
said Lopez. "When sensation is gone, it's a very lonely life." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's disease does not cause parts of the body to fall off, as many people 
believe. But, if not managed carefully, it can have other harmful effects. 
People with numbness in their extremities sometimes wear their shoes too tight, 
causing sores. They can't feel when their cigarettes burn too near their hands. 
Sometimes they pound their fingers with too much force, causing a shortening of 
the bones. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid these potentially crippling problems, Hansen's patients must overcome 
a natural tendency to regard their insensitive limbs as objects -- a phenomenon 
best illustrated by the story, often repeated by Hansen's specialists, of a man 
who helped with the cooking in his village by sticking his hands into hot coals 
to retrieve potatoes that fell off the grill. 
</P>
<P>
"They were utensils to him. They weren't his hands, they were more like a 
shovel or a spade," said Frank. "People don't care about insensitive parts. 
They have to learn to love a part they can't feel." Her advice to patients: 
"You have to look at your hands and feet as your babies that can't cry." 
</P>
<P>
As well as maintaining a detailed regimen of self-examination, regular clinic 
visits and hygiene, patients must also learn how best to heal their psychic 
wounds and to brace for inevitable insults. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, for example, one young patient at the clinic decided it would 
be best if he told his co-workers about his condition. He was fired. Frank told 
him his employer's behavior was illegal, but the young man refused to return, 
opting instead to find another job. Efforts to debunk the myths surrounding 
Hansen's disease are often thwarted by seemingly reputable sources. In most 
editions of the Bible, for example, the ghastly symptoms attributed to leprosy 
actually are a composite of a variety of diseases, from fungal infections to 
psoriasis. (The Hebrew word, zara 'ath, was translated "leprosy" long before 
the modern usage of the term had restricted it to a single specific disease). 
</P>
<P>
What's worse, the Bible clearly suggests that leprosy is God's way of punishing 
sinners -- a belief that clinic workers find they must regularly refute. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a germ, not the biblical disease," Frank has explained again and 
again. But even for people of other faiths, the stigma is powerful. Frank says 
one young Cambodian boy refused treatment because, he said, "that's how I'm 
supposed to be. This is punishment for past wrongs." 
</P>
<P>
Frightening Hollywood images depicted in film classics such as "Ben Hur" -- 
pitiable hammer-footed souls with their wounds wrapped in gauze -- don't help 
matters any. Neither do current movie previews, like one airing now for "The 
Two Jakes," in which Jack Nicholson describes the secret to his success like 
this: "In this town, I'm the leper with the most fingers." 
</P>
<P>
One-liners like that make Frank cringe -- for every off-hand remark, she knows 
she will probably field scores of worried questions. 
</P>
<P>
One woman whose daughter had sent her a handbag made by Hansen's sufferers in 
Africa called the clinic. Would she get sick, she asked, if she slung it over 
her shoulder? 
</P>
<P>
An agitated businessman expressed alarm when he received a fund-raising appeal 
in his morning mail from a leprosarium in the Philippines. He wanted to know if 
he should he keep his staff from touching it? 
</P>
<P>
Frank's response: Don't panic. Though technically Hansen's Disease is an 
infectious condition, more than 90% of the population couldn't get it if they 
tried -- especially not from a handbag. (Research scientists speculate that the 
disease is probably transmitted much like tuberculosis, through the upper 
respiratory tract.) 
</P>
<P>
Doctors can also be ignorant. Lopez remembers completing his rounds one day in 
a San Diego hospital. Afterward, when he and his fellow physicians compared 
notes, Lopez told them he believed one patient they had seen had Hansen's. 
</P>
<P>
"One doctor stood up, got pale, started perspiring and ran to wash his hands," 
Lopez said. "This kind of an impulse is automatic until we learn." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this ingrained prejudice, Lopez believes his patients will flourish if 
they fight the urge to retreat from the world. He discourages all but the most 
ill from getting disability classifications that allow them to park in 
handicapped parking spaces. He encourages them to take an active part in their 
own treatment and generally tries to squelch what he calls "the 'poor me 
syndrome.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to think of themselves as (they would) other people," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
In that vein, visitors to the clinic could probably take a lesson from one 
long-time patient, a Mexican man in his 30s whose disease was diagnosed in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a person who likes work, life . . . (I say) thank you for another day, 
thank you (that) I can walk, thank you that I can eat; in my mind, for me, I 
feel strong,' " he told Frank in a tape-recorded interview. "I know this 
Hansen's is very, very strong and the problem for another person might be, 'I 
can't do it.' (But) I can learn with being sick. I can live with the Hansen's." 
</P>
<P>
For him, the first step to healing was choosing his words. 
</P>
<P>
"The skin specialist doctor said, 'Your problem is Hansen's,' " he said. "I 
never used 'la lepra,' because it is not necessary with my problem to use that 
word. . . . A lot of people would say, 'Do you have la lepra? OK, I can't 
touch.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facts About Hansen's Disease 
</P>
<P>
* Known cases: 10 million worldwide. Of those, 6,000 live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
* Only 5% of the world population is susceptible, earning Hansen's the title of 
the least infectious of the infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
* In the U.S., most cases occur in foreign-born people. 
</P>
<P>
* Symptoms: sudden loss of feeling in hands or feet; painful swelling or 
bumpiness of skin, especially on the face, hands and feet; loss of eyelashes or 
outer edges of eyebrows; earlobes swollen and turned out. 
</P>
<P>
* Period between exposure and the onset of illness: six months to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
* There is no vaccine for Hansen's disease and no test to determine if a person 
has been exposed. However, the disease is completely treatable with drug 
therapies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Myths and Realities: 
</P>
<P>
The myth: Hansen's disease is caused by eating spoiled fish; by engaging too 
frequently in sex; by drinking tainted water. 
</P>
<P>
The reality: Hansen's disease is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, a bacterium 
that can infect the skin and nerves. Although it remains a mystery why some 
people are more susceptible to the disease, scientists believe it is an 
opportunistic infection that takes root when a person's immune system is 
overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The myth: Hansen's disease is a scourge delivered upon sinners by God. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality: In the Bible, the word "leprosy" is used to describe the symptoms 
of a variety of diseases -- a translation that has become outdated since the 
term now refers to a single, specific disease. Scientists see no link between 
the illness and immoral behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The myth: Hansen's disease causes parts of the body to fall off. 
</P>
<P>
The reality: The most troubling development if the disease goes untreated is a 
gradual numbing of the extremities, which results in injuries sometimes going 
unnoticed. Injuries that become infected can lead to potentially crippling 
deformities. But, with care, these deformities are preventable.

LAW: CALLING IN AGENTS WHEN MIGRANTS SEEK HELP FROM THE LAW HELPS NO SIDE IN 
THE MIGRANT PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA SMITH, Claudia Smith, regional counsel for California Rural Legal 
Assistance, is an advocate for North County migrant workers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, two undocumented farm workers went to East County's 
Ranchita sheriff's substation to ask for help claiming unpaid wages from a 
local grower. The way they figured it, being cheated out of several months' 
hard labor was too great a wrong for las autoridades (the authorities) not to 
set right. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies on duty called in Border Patrol agents, ostensibly to 
interpret for them. The two farm workers soon found themselves on their way to 
San Ysidro in a Border Patrol van -- dubbed perrera (dog-catcher's wagon) -- 
empty-handed and convinced that any contact with law enforcement invites 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
In the northern half of San Diego County, where sheriff's deputies not only 
police the unincorporated areas but are under contract to cities with numerous 
day laborers, this conviction is widely shared by migrants. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of such mistrust can be dire for a population that is actually 
terribly victimized, despite a series of attempts to portray farm workers as 
perpetrators of serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
For example, early this year, farm workers in Rainbow-area encampments endured 
several weeks of payday holdups by a pair of gun-toting Anglos. Only when a 
robbery victim was shot in the stomach without provocation was the Fallbrook 
sheriff's substation called. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what took them so long, the workers explained that el sheriff usually 
brought along la migra (the Border Patrol), making even the newly legalized 
among them apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies again professed that they team up with the Border Patrol 
simply to avail themselves of Border Patrol agents' Spanish-language skills. 
Few sheriff's deputies are sufficiently conversant in Spanish to qualify for 
the department's bilingual bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it behooves the department to quickly better its ability to 
communicate directly with the substantial number of non-English speaking people 
working and living in North County. For sheriff's deputies, a smattering of 
street Spanish, ineffective in the past, no longer does the trick, because 
Spanish is barely a second language for a new wave of migrants from southern 
Mexico and the highlands of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
However, the community relations problem at hand goes beyond the Sheriff's 
Department's non-compliance with state bilingual services' mandates for public 
agencies like those involved in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Given the leading role sheriff's deputies played in recent alien roundups 
solicited by the city of Encinitas, it would seem that the department has opted 
to actively enforce immigration laws, instead of focusing on police work. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, this partnership between the two agencies is self-defeating for the 
Sheriff's Department because it burns much-needed bridges to immigrant 
communities. Police departments from Santa Ana to San Jose have recognized 
this, and decline to participate in immigration raids. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco police do not even inquire into immigration status or release 
information to the Border Patrol of an arrestee's suspected illegal presence, 
unless the offense charged entails controlled substances. A narrower directive 
allowing release of such information in the case of any felony has been 
proposed in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the fact that effective law enforcement depends on a high degree of 
cooperation by the entire public served, sheriff's deputies, with border patrol 
agents at their sides, descended on three Encinitas encampments one Sunday 
afternoon last month. 
</P>
<P>
Using trespass as a pretext to detain and interrogate migrants about alien 
status, they set the stage for immigration dragnets of questionable legality. 
</P>
<P>
The trespass arrests become all the more transparent when one takes into 
account that complaints wholly unrelated to secluded encampment living (ranging 
from drinking and urinating in public, to a perplexing "verbally harassing 
children") were cited at every turn to justify participation by sheriff's 
deputies. All too predictably, each one of the 29 arrested was summarily turned 
over for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the civil rights questions raised by the blatant piggybacking of 
immigration sweeps onto minor offenses, the joint operation is troubling 
because it greatly intensified undocumented migrants' fear of sheriff deputies 
and fueled anger and resentment on the part of documented migrants with whom 
they share encampments. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, an "I'm your amigo" message delivered last week by a 
sheriff's deputy to an all-documented work force at Encinitas' hiring hall was 
reported in the press as not sitting especially well with observers of the 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue that looms large is law-enforcement priorities. The Sheriff's 
Department has a wide latitude to set them in unincorporated areas and retains 
such discretion in cities contracting for its services. Was a big show of 
muscle that netted the deportation of 29 encampment dwellers -- most of whom 
returned within two days -- cost-effective? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to most people's understanding, undocumented migrants' illegal 
presence in this country is normally not a crime, but a civil matter that 
carries a deportation penalty. All the more reason why the Sheriff's Department 
shouldn't launch police efforts aimed primarily at deporting undocumented 
workers by detaining them under the guise of enforcing trespass, loitering, 
littering and public drinking and urination laws. 
</P>
<P>
If compassion for workers subjected to so much indignity while trying to feed 
far-away families is not motivation enough for rethinking stepped up 
cooperation between the Sheriff's Department and the Border Patrol, pragmatic 
considerations certainly should be.

ICE CHEST POLICE?

<TEXT>
<P>
This is what you advocated with your editorial on the alcohol ban at La Jolla 
Shores beach. ("Need for Drinking Ban Is Sign of Times," June 10.) 
</P>
<P>
Do you really want the authorities checking the contents of people's coolers? 
Is this the kind of society you want to live in? 
</P>
<P>
You can't legislate away every social ill. Neither can you sanitize the beach 
of all obnoxious people. 
</P>
<P>
I can enjoy the beach without a beer. Probably you can, too. So can the people 
pushing the alcohol ban. We all have nice back yards and patio furniture. 
</P>
<P>
We are the people that the City Council responds to. The public domain is being 
tailored for us. 
</P>
<P>
And the schlemiels who live in apartment buildings? Let them drink beer on the 
steps.

OFFICERS WHO CHEATED NEED STRONGER LESSON IN HONESTY; 
</P>
<P>
LACK OF PUNISHMENT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Schoolchildren know that you don't cheat on tests. National City police 
officers apparently have to be warned. 
</P>
<P>
That's one lesson to be learned from Police Chief Stan Knee's decision not to 
discipline any of the 11 officers who admitted to "exchanging information," as 
Knee prefers it, before the second day of a two-day promotional exam. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two officers signed up to take the May oral exam for 22 newly created 
positions as "senior officers" and eligibility for a 5% pay raise. The exam was 
designed to test competence in departmental policies and procedures. Eleven 
officers took the exam the first day. Later, in casual conversation with 
officers who had yet to take the test, some officers described the questions 
they had been asked. Some of the listeners walked away. Others didn't. 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent investigation, 11 officers freely admitted that they had 
discussed the questions. 
</P>
<P>
Knee made all 11 ineligible for the new position, and reported his decision to 
the city's civil service commission, which concurred. No further discipline was 
meted out. 
</P>
<P>
Knee defends his action, saying the officers lost the chance for a pay raise 
(but only until the next test, when they will again be eligible to compete for 
the 11 remaining vacancies). There was no conspiracy to cheat, he adds, only 
the mistake of discussing the questions. The officers freely admitted 
wrongdoing. And the examiners failed to warn the first group of officers not to 
discuss the questions, Knee says. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that was an oversight. But Knee's decision isn't good enough. These 
officers should have been sanctioned, if only by a formal reprimand. Like it or 
not, the public holds police officers to a higher standard of honesty because 
they enforce the law. When they cross the line, it is especially important that 
they pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, by the time you're old enough to carry a gun, you should have learned 
that it's not acceptable to cheat on exams.

REFLECTIONS: 'MY BELIEF IS THAT WE WEREN'T PUT ON THIS EARTH JUST TO SATISFY 
OUR OWN NEEDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Dick Childs, a physical plant engineer at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, 
works with metal and machinery, but, at the hospital, he's known as the man 
with the soft heart for kids. A former Disney employee, he paints cartoon 
figures for children at the hospital and travels to the most remote areas of 
Mexico to take medical supplies and clothing to children untouched by 
civilization. He was interviewed by Times Staff writer G. Jeanette Avent. 
(Photo courtesy of Kaiser.) 
</P>
<P>
I've been interested in helping kids ever since I can remember. I worked at 
Disneyland for about 13 years, running and maintaining the steam locomotives 
and Mark Twain steamboat. I also got into cartooning there. I had always been 
interested in drawing, and at Disney I was surrounded by it. 
</P>
<P>
I got started drawing for children because my daughter, who was in the second 
grade at the time had a friend who was diagnosed with cancer. I started drawing 
Disney figures for her and other children with the approval of the Disney 
owners. Since I've been at Kaiser Permanente, I've been drawing and painting 
pictures of Minnie and Mickey Mouse for children of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
When I moved back to San Diego in 1981 to work at Kaiser, I began traveling to 
Mexico more and more. I've been traveling in Mexico for more than 30 years, so 
I'm pretty familiar with the country. I grew up in Valley Center in the 
Escondido area on a horse and cattle ranch, and the Indians and Mexicans were 
always in this part of the country or passing through. I just grew up with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
I've been down to the rain forests near the Mexican border with Guatemala, and 
I hope to be going back after the rainy season is over in September. I have a 
large supply of medical equipment to take down there. People know that I do 
this, so different companies who make sutures and needles give me supplies. 
</P>
<P>
I've always been interested in the primitive peoples and their history. I go to 
a little village near San Cristobal de las Casas. A major problem is getting 
the supplies in. The village is up over 7,000 feet above sea level in the 
jungle. I'll fly to Mexico City, spend another day of travel to get to the 
mountains and San Cristobal, and then walk several days. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to go far into Mexico to find needy children. One of the 
cases I worked with was a 16-year-old girl, Rafa Carlos from Tijuana. She was 
burned over 65% of her body with third-degree burns. I started visiting Rafa, 
and I wound up living there by her bedside. When she was discharged from the 
hospital, she went home, and that was going to be it. Her family didn't know 
anything further could be done, but I talked to her about reconstructive work, 
and we brought her over the border for an exam. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Kaiser doctors volunteered time to help her and that began a long 
year of coming across the border a minimum of two times a week. She was in 
surgery for about five hours. She was really a terrible sight to look at. She 
didn't go outside, wouldn't see anyone and just closed herself away. But now 
she's doing quite well. Her family has a little grocery store, and Rafa has 
taken over the store. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of times I don't have a contact with anyone in the more remote areas. 
Maybe I've heard about it or read about it. I just go, often by myself. I have 
enough Spanish to get in trouble and enough where they laugh at me. But most of 
the primitives don't speak any Spanish at all; they have their own language. 
For many years, I kept waiting for the language barrier to be a problem, but I 
think eventually I found out that communication has nothing really to do with 
language. We can draw pictures in the dirt, laugh together. If all else fails, 
I get taken by the hand or take them by the hand. It's never ever been a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Why do I do it all? My belief is that we weren't put on this earth just to 
satisfy our own needs or our own goals. I've met a lot of beautiful, beautiful 
people. They welcome me into their lands. They invite me back. I just enjoy it.

BLACK LEADERS SEEK COURT, GUN LAW CHANGES AFTER BAIL ERROR; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISM: A COMMUNITY GROUP WANTS TO USE THE SLAYING OF A PREACHER AND 
SUBSEQUENT MISHANDLING OF THE MURDER SUSPECTS AS A RALLYING POINT FOR CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE REFORMS. 
</P>

<P>
Black community leaders in Pacoima said Saturday that they would use the 
controversy over the treatment of two white students accused of murdering a 
black preacher as a rallying point for gaining reforms in the criminal justice 
system and tighter restrictions on gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to take the unfortunate death of Rev. White and build on this," said 
Fred Taylor, president of the community group Focus 90s, referring to the July 
28 slaying of the Rev. Carl White in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The death should be "a rallying point to get people involved in working within 
the system to change things." 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 Pacoima church members and civic leaders gathered Saturday to hear 
details of a 2 1/2-hour closed-door meeting held Friday between Taylor and two 
other black leaders and top officials of the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office to discuss the handling of those accused of White's death. 
</P>
<P>
White was shot in the back of the head in his home, allegedly during a dispute 
that arose when Philip J. Dimenno and Dana L. Singer tried to persuade him not 
to report a minor traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno, 19, and Singer, 18, were later arrested, and bail was set at the 
unusually low amount of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The bail was quickly revoked, and the district attorney's office acknowledged 
that a mistake had been made. 
</P>
<P>
Singer and Dimenno are now in jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ministers' Fellowship of the Greater San Fernando Valley, an 
organization of 41 Pacoima-area churches, objected that the original bail had 
been an insult to White's family and possibly racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's meeting, a spokeswoman for the district attorney said the office 
would re-evaluate its bail-setting procedures and publicly apologize to White's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. James V. Lyles, the president of the ministers' fellowship who also 
participated in Friday's meeting, said the black leaders and the district 
attorney's office will hold a news conference Thursday or Friday to announce 
specific terms of the revised policies and to issue the apology. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to work with the district attorney's office so that the criminal 
justice system can be the best that it can be," Lyles said. "We want it to be 
where our people can walk the streets without fears and not be prisoners in 
their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very consistently said that people who commit murder should not be 
granted bail," he said. "We would certainly ask that people who commit crimes 
of violence not be put back on the street whether they are black, white, green 
or gray." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles announced that a town hall-type meeting will be held Sept. 8 so that 
members of the community at large can become involved in efforts of the 
ministers and Focus 90s, a group of six homeowner associations and several 
community groups in the Pacoima area. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a communitywide meeting, and we're inviting the leadership of all 
organizations," Lyles said. "We want to map out new steps. There are two or 
three areas we need to move into." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Lyles said, gun control of some type is needed. "If you don't have 
a gun, you can't shoot anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The ministers' fellowship voted Aug. 11 to call for the firing or resignation 
of Billy D. Webb, the head of the district attorney's operations at the San 
Fernando Courthouse who recommended the low initial bail. 
</P>
<P>
But Lyles said that if the district attorney's representatives follow through 
on their promises, that vote will be formally rescinded next week. 
</P>
<P>
"After yesterday's meeting, we discovered that Billy Webb is not the issue," he 
said. "Billy Webb is more a victim of the system." 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor agreed with Lyles, he said he still would like to see Webb 
reassigned. "I still would not want him out here." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles said black community leaders will also meet Saturday with Mayor Tom 
Bradley to discuss crime and other issues in the Pacoima area.

RADAR TRAP: SPEED LIMITS OFTEN RISE AFTER SURVEYS; 
</P>
<P>
TORRANCE: RESIDENTS WANT RULES ENFORCED, BUT POLICE CAN ONLY USE RADAR DEVICES 
ON STREETS THAT HAVE UP-TO-DATE TRAFFIC SURVEYS. THOSE SURVEYS CAN ACTUALLY 
RAISE SPEEDS. RESIDENTS DON'T WANT THAT.

<P>
Not so long ago, it was difficult to drive through Torrance without spotting at 
least one police officer checking traffic speeds by radar. 
</P>
<P>
They were there on Anza Avenue, Calle Mayor and Palos Verdes Boulevard with 
efficient regularity, pointing their bulky radar guns at wary drivers. 
Occasionally officers lay in wait on Lomita Boulevard, Pacific Coast Highway, 
Madrona and Prairie avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance police now are hard-pressed to find a major street where they can use 
their radar units. Mandatory traffic speed surveys for many of the city's 
most-used arteries have expired -- some as long as two years ago -- making it 
illegal for police to use radar to issue speeding tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Although officers still ticket speeders using other methods, including making 
an educated estimate of speed and attempting to pace cars as they race away, 
the increasing number of streets where radar use is forbidden is creating a 
headache for police. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we're frustrated," said Lt. Dennis Frandsen, head of the 
department's traffic division. "Radar is simply a tool, but it's the best tool 
we have. It's an uphill battle when they take away the tools that we need to do 
our job well." 
</P>
<P>
Police and city officials, who are responsible for making sure the surveys are 
kept up-to-date, agree that the problem has been festering for years. 
</P>
<P>
Under state laws that date from the 1960s, cities wanting to conduct radar 
enforcement on their major arteries -- generally those wider than 40 feet -- 
must survey them every five years to determine current traffic conditions and 
prevailing speeds. 
</P>
<P>
In order to allow radar enforcement, speed limits for those streets must be set 
according to how fast 85% of the motorists are driving. 
</P>
<P>
City officials may set a lower speed limit only if there are significant 
considerations, such as a blind curve or a nearby school, that call for a 
slower speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy behind this . . . is that 85% of the people will not drive 
faster than is safe," Frandsen said. "It's sort of like letting people vote on 
the speed limit (that) should be set." 
</P>
<P>
Although smaller neighborhood streets are exempt from the survey requirements, 
any radar tickets issued on major roads that do not have an up-to-date survey 
must be dismissed, Torrance Municipal Court Commissioner Harlan Swain said. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, traffic officers do not make the mistake of using radar 
where it is not allowed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any big rash of dismissals," he said. "That doesn't seem to be 
a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Officials for some of the smaller South Bay cities said they conduct surveys on 
all their streets every four or five years, changing speed limits as required 
and maintaining radar enforcement without interruption. Some larger cities, 
such as Redondo Beach, conduct one-quarter of their surveys each year, 
staggering the workload. 
</P>
<P>
Speed limit changes are made without much comment from residents, officials in 
other cities said. 
</P>
<P>
In Torrance, however, residences have been built along more than half the major 
arteries, creating a resident population of activists determined to keep speeds 
down. 
</P>
<P>
When city officials have attempted to increase speed limits to meet survey 
requirements, residents have fought the changes. 
</P>
<P>
So when a consultant turned in new surveys for the entire city early last year 
that called for speed limit increases on a number of streets, officials sent 
the surveys back and asked the consultant to find mitigating factors that could 
keep the limits down, city traffic manager John Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, city employees have begun conducting surveys themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules are very stringent and don't leave a whole lot of flexibility . . . 
but we're trying to see what we can do to make everybody comfortable with the 
situation," Vance said. "Before we subject ourselves and the City Council to 
this, we want to look at everything and make sure an increase is the sole 
recommendation we can make." 
</P>
<P>
A key problem, Frandsen said, is the public's perception that raising a speed 
limit means that drivers are going to travel faster than they already do. 
</P>
<P>
"People feel that if you make a higher speed limit, you're going to increase 
the speeds on the street, but studies have shown that is not true," Frandsen 
said. "The public doesn't understand the process well enough. We can try to 
explain it, but . . . when you get emotions involved in it, it just doesn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Frandsen said a good way to resolve the confusion caused by the survey laws 
would be to change them so that speed limits remain the same unless 
circumstances on the streets change. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that has made our system work is voluntary compliance, and 
there is far less voluntary compliance than many years ago," he said. "I think 
that calls into question this whole philosophy of allowing people to vote on 
their speed limits." 
</P>
<P>
Although residents want radar enforcement on their streets, they say they do 
not want the speed limit increases required to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Anza Avenue was surveyed in 1984, residents living along the 
southern half of the street were appalled when city officials told them that 
the speed limit would have to be increased from 25 to 30 m.p.h. to continue 
radar enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of heated argument, residents said they would stop 
fighting the change if the city agreed to conduct strict radar enforcement of 
the new speed, said Frank Rizzardi, president of Southwood Riviera Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, that survey expired and a new one said the limit now should 
be raised to 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid if they raise it to 35, they're not going to carry out the strict 
radar enforcement," Rizzardi said. "I'm afraid they're going to let people 
think they can go five or 10 miles an hour over that. Anza already is like a 
speedway." 
</P>
<P>
Residents on other streets recommended for speed limit increases said cars were 
clocked at higher speeds during the survey because the old speed limits were 
not enforced strictly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I'm almost rear-ended pulling into my driveway when I'm 
slowing down and all these speed demons behind me want to go their 45 or 50 or 
55 miles an hour," said Pam O'Brien, who lives on Sepulveda Boulevard between 
Anza and Palos Verdes Boulevard. Last year's survey called for increasing the 
limit on that street from 40 to 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification at all to impose a higher speed limit on the 
residents who live there," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Snyder, a retired commander of the Police Department's traffic division 
who now sits on the Torrance Traffic Commission, said he has asked staff to 
explain why new surveys have not been approved. 
</P>
<P>
That discussion is scheduled to take place at the commission's next meeting on 
Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the frustrated policemen who can't work radar," Snyder said. "And I 
understand that when you have seven people on the council and you have a lot of 
people screaming bloody murder that they don't want the speed limits raised 
that the council is going to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Police Department's hands are tied if they can't work radar," he said. 
"It's almost impossible to get behind a car in a black-and-white with gum-ball 
machines on top and then try to pace a speeder without them noticing. . . . How 
are the police supposed to do their job?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>

ANTI-ABORTION RALLY DRAWS 1,000 -- AND SOME HECKLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 anti-abortion protesters, about three dozen hecklers and at least 
80 Los Angeles police officers converged on the steps of City Hall on Saturday 
for a morning of rhetoric, prayer and verbal barbs. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion forces, far outnumbering the competition and backed by a 
public address system, dominated the exchange. They sang hymns, pledged 
allegiance to the flag and, for about five minutes of the two-hour 
demonstration, lay face down on the ground in a display of humility. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion-rights activists made up for its small showing with a chorus of 
hoots, hollers, whistles, horns and jeers. When hundreds of anti-abortion 
activists began to prostrate themselves, the hecklers responded with sheep-like 
"Baa! Baa!" noises. 
</P>
<P>
The police, for the most part, kept straight faces and formed a human wall 
between the two camps. They made two arrests, but those came hours earlier when 
a man and a woman were caught spray-painting pro-choice slogans in fluorescent 
colors on nearby sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a peaceful demonstration," Police Lt. Les Lutz said. "We were just 
there to make sure nothing went down." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion rally, organized by Operation Rescue, began at 8 a.m. with a 
prayer vigil in front of a downtown Los Angeles clinic. The protesters marched 
to City Hall, then gathered later for a picnic in Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, abortion-rights activists marshaled most of their troops outside 
four Los Angeles women's clinics. The Clinic Defense Alliance of Los Angeles, a 
project of the Feminist Majority, had a total of about 300 people on guard in 
case anti-abortion protesters tried to block the entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, however, focused on freeing the dozens 
of activists nationwide who are in jail for such blockades. At City Hall, he 
called on the crowd to write the judges who sentenced them and demand they be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The hecklers chanted "Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!" Many of them waved 
swastika-bearing signs that read, "Danger: Religious Bigots." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, an Operation Rescue activist, who had recently been released from 
Los Angeles County jail for blocking a clinic entrance, claimed that there was 
really only one important mission awaiting the true believer: 
</P>
<P>
"Make babies," said a pregnant Deborah Grumbine, who is expecting her 11th 
child. "Lots of them."

PRICE DROP DRIVES AWAY RECYCLERS OF NEWSPAPERS; 
</P>
<P>
GLUT: THE SUPPLY OF NEWSPRINT MUSHROOMED AS CURBSIDE RECYCLING BECAME POPULAR. 
BUT INDUSTRY DEMAND FOR IT HAS NOT BEEN VERY HIGH.

The price paid for recycled newspapers has plunged in recent years and may drop 
further before rebounding, according to the author of a state report on 
newspaper recycling due out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many community groups that recycled newspapers as fund raisers 
have quit. Even the Boy Scouts have dropped out. The last of the troops in the 
Western Los Angeles County Council of the Boy Scouts, which includes the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, quit recycling papers earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The newspapers are paying $5 a ton," said Karen Judisch, who works with the 
council. "To try and get that amount and be scoutmaster or cubmaster using all 
that gas, it just isn't worth it. It's really a shame." 
</P>
<P>
A telephone survey of recycling centers in the San Fernando Valley found that 
those still accepting papers paid about $10 a ton, or a half-cent per pound. 
Three years ago, centers were paying between $20 and $40 per ton. 
</P>
<P>
The price of recycled newsprint dropped during the second quarter of 1990, 
after remaining stable through the previous three quarters, according to the 
recycling report prepared by the California Integrated Waste Management Board, 
the agency recently created to bring about a statewide reduction in the amount 
of waste going to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The supply of used newsprint has mushroomed as curbside recycling programs have 
proliferated, industry officials note. At the same time, publishers have failed 
to switch to using recycled newsprint, and demand from other industrial 
consumers has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The soft market is old news to area recyclers and paper companies. Bob Fagan, 
president of Sun Valley Paper Stock, a Sunland firm that buys old newspapers 
from recycling centers and sells it to paper mills in Asia, said the price of 
"super-clean" recycled newsprint has dropped from $127 a ton a year ago to $30 
a ton today. 
</P>
<P>
The result locally is that some recyclers have stopped accepting newspaper. 
Marv Saidner of San Fernando Recycling in Pacoima said his firm stopped taking 
newspapers four years ago. Now, he said, he concentrates on recycling aluminum 
cans and California redemption containers. 
</P>
<P>
Other area recycling companies still accept papers, but no longer pay for them. 
"We essentially lose money on it," said Dave Sanders, branch accountant for 
Burbank Recycling, which stopped paying for newsprint over a year ago. The cost 
of transporting the paper to processing factories is greater than the amount 
his company receives for the product, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
Those companies that absorb the cost of accepting old newsprint said they do so 
primarily to keep their customers bringing in other recyclable goods that 
remain profitable. "We do it more for customer service," said Ron Schweitzer, 
president of Mobile Recycling, a regional firm that accepts a variety of 
recyclable products. "Our whole business philosophy is to be a one-stop 
recycling center. It's sort of a form of advertising." 
</P>
<P>
A major factor that may cause the excess supply of recycled newspaper to grow 
even more is a new state law requiring cities to reduce significantly the 
amount of trash they dump in landfills over the next decade, said Brian Foran, 
associate waste management specialist for the waste board and the author of the 
state report. 
</P>
<P>
But another new statute designed to strengthen demand for used newsprint may 
cause prices to eventually rebound. That law requires commercial printers to 
use at least 25% recycled newsprint as of Jan. 1, 1991, and at least 50% by 
Jan. 1, 2000. Increased demand for recycled paper may also come from mills 
planned for construction that process used newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
"Within three years, I'm sure the markets are going to be real healthy," Foran 
said.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: TREASURE COLLECTED BY PENINSULA FILM, ART AND MUSIC BUFF 
IS OPENED TO THE PUBLIC.

The late Paul Ballard was a man who loved the movies, art and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
A Hollywood film teacher, Ballard loved them enough to amass about 20,000 
photographic slides, nearly 1,000 books and 900 recordings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a giant hobby, his life's work," said Curt Wagner, a film buff who 
purchased the collection a decade ago when Ballard offered it for sale. Wagner 
and his wife, Helen, later donated the collection to the Palos Verdes Art 
Center. Mrs. Wagner, assisted by Palos Verdes Library District librarian Lana 
Yarymovych, spent several years cataloguing it. 
</P>
<P>
After resting quietly in bookcases and cabinets, where it has been used largely 
by teachers, the collection has recently been made available for public use on 
Thursdays from 1 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the slides document the Hollywood film industry from its early, silent 
years in 1916 to the days of World War II in 1942. Some 2,000 movies -- with 
such luminaries as Greta Garbo, Rudolph Valentino, Clark Gable and Marlene 
Dietrich -- are captured in scene shots taken by set photographers that were 
copied from still photos. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the slides are of great paintings, sculptures and buildings of 
Europe that Ballard photographed during two years he spent on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
Books in the collection -- some of them too large for shelves -- provide a 
history of art and artists from classical to modern times. Others cover 
Hollywood's filmmakers, stars and studios. Many of the books are out of print 
and the slides are one-of-a-kind photos. Most of the recordings -- on 
pre-compact disc LPs -- are of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
The collection is housed in the art center's Norris Film Gallery, at Crestridge 
Road and Crenshaw Boulevard in Rancho Palos Verdes. Books may be borrowed, but 
records must be listened to and slides viewed at the center. Borrowers are 
charged a one-time $5 fee; slides may be copied for an additional charge. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, who plays the role of librarian every Thursday, said he expects 
students and researchers will be the most prevelent visitors. "This material 
should be used," he said. GERALD FARIS

Tonight was the night. After two years of attending monthly poetry readings in 
Hermosa Beach, Portia Chow was ready. 
</P>
<P>
Up in a small room at the community center, munching on potato chips and 
sipping wine, an eclectic group of poets read their latest creations and gauged 
their colleagues' reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Chortles, claps, gasps, frowns, sighs: These were just some of the signs that 
the anxious readers used to measure the reception to their work. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was Chow's turn. For the 42-year-old physician, writing poetry has 
become a private way of dealing with pent-up emotions and trauma that still 
reverberate from a childhood spent in war-torn Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Now she wanted other people to hear what she had been writing all these years. 
Hesitantly, she began her poem "Post-War Games," which told of "legless 
soldiers walking piggyback on a fellow friend." 
</P>
<P>
Chow was one of about 10 poets who read at last Sunday's meeting of the Hermosa 
Friends of the Arts Poetry Series, where first-time readers like Chow, as well 
as experienced performers, are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
After the applause, Chow said she was pleased despite being nervous and 
self-conscious about her Korean accent. 
</P>
<P>
Like Chow, some poets explored age-old issues of love and war. Others poked fun 
at figures such as Kentucky Fried Chicken's Colonel Sanders and "kind and 
gentle President Bush." Some poems rhymed, some poems sang, some poems fell 
with a clang. 
</P>
<P>
One or two special guest poets usually follow the open readings that begin the 
evening. Depending on the guests, the crowd can reach up to 50 people, said 
Denise Dumars, one of the group's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the guests last week, a self-described exhibitionist named Willie Sims, 
accompanied his poems with screams, hoots and whistles. "I don't write for the 
page, I write for the stage," rhymed Sims. 
</P>
<P>
The retired credit manager, originally from Miami, said the readings are 
important because they allow poets to interact with others through their work. 
"It's like therapy," Sims said afterward, stuffing into his sock a bunch of 
dollar bills, his pay for the evening. The guest readers are paid a small 
stipend derived from the audience's $3.50 donations. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry readings have become increasingly popular, Sims said, and although 
readings are quite frequent in the South Bay, the Hermosa Beach program is the 
only series in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sims: "It's a chance for everybody to be famous for 15 minutes." IAN M.

CAR RUNS OFF ROAD NEAR SEA WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego woman is in fair condition at UCSD Medical Center after the car she 
was riding in struck a guardrail and plummeted down an embankment at the 
intersection of Sea World Drive and Ingraham Street about 2:20 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>

POLICE BLAME MARITAL PROBLEMS IN WIFE'S SLAYING, MAN'S SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A man who apparently became distraught when his wife served him with divorce 
papers shot and killed the woman in the back office of their small Van Nuys 
restaurant and then turned the gun on himself, Los Angeles police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Marcia Brandt said Fernando Vasquez, 41, and Maria Vasquez, 32, lived 
in Sylmar and operated Marco's, a small Mexican restaurant and bar in the 7700 
block of Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Both had been having marital problems for two years," Brandt said. Maria 
Vasquez had recently filed for divorce and on Friday went "to the restaurant to 
serve her husband with divorce papers." 
</P>
<P>
After arriving at the restaurant at 2:30 p.m., she went into a rear office with 
her husband to discuss the divorce, police said. About four hours later, a 
concerned relative arrived at the restaurant and broke into the locked office, 
where he found the man and woman dead. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said investigators found evidence that Fernando Vasquez shot his wife in 
the head and then shot himself in the head. The gun was found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant was open but there were no customers in the late afternoon. 
Police said employees apparently did not hear the shots from the office because 
a radio and a television were playing. The couple had four children, police 
said.

MAN KILLED ON ROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
A Mexican man was killed after being run over early Saturday on Del Dios 
Highway south of Escondido, said the California Highway Patrol and the county 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Lara-Rodriguez, 34, was pronounced dead at Palomar Medical Center at 
3:37 a.m., said Deputy Coroner Robert Engel. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CHP, the man apparently was laying in the road when he was 
struck by the vehicle, which left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not say if the man had been driving a vehicle or if he was a 
pedestrian. They also did not say where in Mexico he was from.

"I see an increase in the kind of urban issues as the Valley becomes more and 
more urban. In a lot of ways that's very exciting. It's very exciting to see 
the mixed ethnicity, the kind of exciting city life that comes. But I also see 
the freeways more crowded. I certainly see a school district that's more and 
more falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools are failing -- failing our kids both literally and figuratively. The 
district is trying to carry an overwhelming bureaucratic mess, trying to 
respond to kids as though it is still 20-25 years ago. Teachers are weighed 
down by a giant bureaucracy. They're trying to micro-manage the district from 
the top, trying to force a pattern on a city that's no longer one kind of 
person. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley faces an even greater problem than elsewhere. Fourteen languages 
are spoken at my daughter's school. On my street, people are from about seven 
countries. It requires dealing with education in a whole different way. Schools 
are no longer places where you can assume kids are going to enter in 
kindergarten and get out in high school, enter in September and get out in 
June. They're going to enter at all kinds of different times with all kinds of 
different backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to use the creativity of our parents, of our teachers and even of our 
children. There's a real mythology that parents don't care. I think parents 
care an enormous amount about their children. It's the bureaucratic system that 
tries to scare parents away and tell them they aren't needed and they're 
stupid. The school board hasn't been willing to change its way of doing of 
things. 
</P>
<P>
"The teacher my daughter had in first grade was horrid, totally incapable of 
dealing with the situation. I've been lucky, my wife has not had to work 
outside the home, so she's been able to hang around the school and make sure 
things were OK. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten to the point it has because more and more white middle-class 
people have pulled their children out of the system and the system just doesn't 
respond to the complaints of minorities. People need to get organized, they 
have to get organized to raise money. Politicians can do one thing: They can 
count. They can count votes and they can count money."

"I used to know everybody around here, but now they're all renters renting from 
absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
"The area also is becoming very commercialized -- no longer the little 
ma-and-pop stores. They are tearing down the old, historic homes in the barrio 
and building new apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember seeing marked-up walls. Graffiti gives birth to crime and 
crime gives birth to graffiti. They're messages of prostitution, of laundering 
money, of selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only affecting children, it's affecting business. People are afraid 
to buy in places because there's graffiti there. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up, I could get on my bike and ride around the block and 
not worry about abduction, about rape. I will not allow my daughter to even go 
down to the little store about two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of months ago, my son was at a family fiesta at one of the churches 
in Pacoima. He drove in front of a Blazer, waved and they thought he made some 
kind of gang sign. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed him a shotgun. He raced up and down the freeway for about an hour, 
trying to attract somebody's attention. He was able to get away, but we lived 
in panic for two, three months. They say that they get your license plates, 
they'll tag you and then just blow you away. We had to get all new license 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see public affordable housing for all these people who are coming 
into this area. I'd like to see the absentee landowners be checked on by some 
building and safety watchdog program. 
</P>
<P>
"How about programs for our kids so these kinds of gang people or wanna-bes who 
are influencing our children have somewhere to go? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see anything more important than cleaning up the street of graffiti. 
Through VOICE, we're working on a graffiti system. A city or state agency needs 
to clean it up on a regular basis, not ask the community organizations to do 
it. That's like saying our police office or fire force will be based on 
community volunteers. Can you imagine what kind of state of chaos we'd be in?"

"More traffic. Less parking. Resembles more of the East Coast rat race that a 
lot of us moved to the West Coast to avoid. East meets West. 
</P>
<P>
"It just takes longer to get anywhere. The village atmosphere is gone. People 
were trying to avoid a lot of the problems that exist on the city side. They 
moved to the Valley and created the same types of problems. It's similar to the 
people who moved from the East Coast to escape problems and ended up bringing 
the problems with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic on the Ventura Freeway used to be congested only one way, eastbound in 
the morning and westbound in the evening. It used to be gridlocked only three 
to four hours a day, now it has bad traffic 90% of the daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will say it's not as bad as New York. But that's not the issue. 
The issue is, is it good or bad? The answer is, it's bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The Burbank Airport is another example of the urban nature. When I moved to 
Sherman Oaks, the Burbank Airport was a cute, satellite airport. Now it's a 
major, urban, mini-LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also another phenomenon. The Valley communities are becoming 
throughways. Ventura and Victory are mini-freeways. People who live in the 
outlying areas -- Agoura, Calabasas -- are traveling through the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We need political leadership or it's going to be business as usual. If we had 
had leadership, we wouldn't have the large density that has created this 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of leadership? Public transportation, reduce the density of new 
construction and give living conditions a higher priority than campaign 
contributions from developers. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, when school busing became a reality in L.A., I was unwilling to have my 
son sit on a bus for three hours a day. Busing was terminated and the students 
didn't return to the public schools. Why? The quality of public school is 
nowhere near the quality of private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"My age group was raised on the concept that only the snooty snobs go to 
private school because the quality of education was essentially the same. But 
it's different here."

"When we moved to Coldwater Canyon, there were still chicken ranches there, 
right at Coldwater Canyon and Vanowen. The congestion has certainly increased 
since then. I remember smog being a word that wasn't there in those days. You 
used to see horses walking down the streets, you used to have guys walking 
around taking pictures of kids on ponies and you could go to the pony rides 
anyplace. 
</P>
<P>
"As I go back to that part of the Valley now, there's no trace left of what was 
there then. But it seems like we were always living on the edge of that demise. 
We've been really fortunate here in Sunland. Basically nothing has changed, 
except that we've lost some access trails to development. Other areas of the 
Valley have really changed for horse riders -- Reseda, Chatsworth. But around 
here some of the roads are still dirt, we can ride right down them. I really 
think we have the best of all lifestyles here: We're close enough to L.A. that 
we can enjoy the entertainment, but you come up over that hill and it's a whole 
other world. Councilman Wachs has really put himself out for us. 
</P>
<P>
"When they put through the Foothill Freeway, there were concerns for horse 
riders. Caltrans wasn't totally insensitive. We do have underpasses. But there 
was nothing they could do about the noise level. I don't want to sound too 
corny, but we lost the ambience of being out there in nature. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, our trails are now multiuse, they're no longer just horse trails. We 
find them to be bike trails and we find them to be joggers' trails. That's not 
good or bad, it's just one of the things that has changed -- we have to share. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see more of a regression. It sounds silly, I know, but I'd like to 
see us go back to utilizing some of those old transportation modes -- bicycles, 
maybe horses. Footing roads up so that bicyclists and riders can use them, so 
we could go to the corner store on our horses. There's no reason why some of 
the more commercial establishments can't provide a horse tie rail. Right now 
the laws on everything are such that they really impede our movement. You have 
to be 100 feet from any kind of eating establishment. It's really encroaching."

DEALING WITH IRVINE'S REAL LOCAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must write in response to the Aug. 9 Newswatch item where Sally Anne 
Sheridan, Irvine's mayor, is quoted as saying she had to move her business 
office from Irvine to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She states her reason for the move to be that Irvine residents kept coming into 
her office and complaining about trees and dog poop in the parkways. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to the quote, it was so horrendous with all the people 
coming in to see the mayor that she couldn't get anything done. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't Mrs. Sheridan the person who recently ran for the office of mayor saying 
that she would concentrate on local issues and accused then-Mayor Larry Agran 
of spending too much time on global issues? 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, what's more local than trees and dog poop in the parkways, Mayor 
Sheridan?

ABUSED TEEN SHELTER -- EDUCATION SACRIFICED AT BUDGET ALTAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The account you published ("Abused Teens Shelter Has Wolf at the Door," Aug. 9) 
regarding the ending of funding for shelters for abused and wayward teens must 
have been very difficult for you to print. 
</P>
<P>
This action by the Orange County Board of Supervisors reflects the thinking of 
most of them and their supporters that rejects the premise that we have laws 
that protect the rights of women to determine the use of their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
They also feel that tax proceeds should not be used to sex educate our teens or 
to provide for those who were born to mothers who were not able to benefit from 
such education. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, education at any level, and for any group or purpose, is at a very low 
priority for members of this group of our citizenry, and support is even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Our esteemed governor agrees with them and finds it is very comfortable to 
balance the budget by reducing or eliminating funding for education and 
welfare, as children don't vote, and welfare recipients are too busy trying to 
find a place to live or food to eat as opposed to voting for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of approving a sales tax increase to improve our highways for the 
benefit of developers (one that has been twice rejected by Orange County), we 
should be considering a sales tax to benefit our more unfortunate citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, that wouldn't benefit those who have sacrificed so much to be 
able to contribute funds for the reelection of our officials. 
</P>
<P>
We live in and enjoy one of the most affluent areas of our country. Why should 
we accept the calloused attitude of our elected officials? 
</P>
<P>
Write to them, call them, attend their meetings, let them know that their 
attitude is totally unacceptable to this society. If they don't change, vote 
them out of office. But remember that you have to vote in order to do that.

<P>
San Diego Police homicide detectives are investigating the death of an 
unidentified man found in La Jolla about 7 a.m. Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
A jogger running north on Via Capri found the body in a dirt lot at the 
intersection of Via Siena, said Lt. Dan Berglund. 
</P>
<P>
The Caucasian male is estimated to be about 35, has reddish-brown hair, a brown 
mustache and false teeth. He was wearing a white T-shirt, aqua sweat pants and 
white high-top shoes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no obvious signs of trauma on the body, which appeared to have been 
dumped there, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of death is unknown, and an autopsy is pending.

RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY -- DON'T PENALIZE THE MOTORISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the San Clemente checkpoint problem of undocumented workers running 
across the freeway: Please don't get too radical. Why should thousands of 
drivers have to suffer because of selfish smugglers letting off their captives 
who, in fright, seem to run. 
</P>
<P>
We experienced the same problem on southbound Interstate 805 at Palm Avenue in 
Chula Vista, and installing lights and flashing lighted signs "Watch out for 
people running" seems to have deterred the accidental deaths. 
</P>
<P>
We travel the San Clemente checkpoint every weekend and are irritated enough at 
waiting five miles in line just to "cross the checkpoint" and don't wish any 
further delays. 
</P>
<P>
We admire the job the Border Patrol does with the resources available. As you 
stated in the article, a high divider will probably not be the answer. Please 
try the lighted signs.

Re "2nd Latino Youth Killed on I-5 in Less Than a Day" (Aug. 10): The American 
Friends Services Committee and their bleeding heart friends are overlooking the 
simplest solution to the recent deaths of Latinos on Interstate 5 at the San 
Clemente checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
I propose that Interstate 5 be closed to all vehicular traffic from the Mexican 
border to Santa Ana. This will enable thousands of illegal aliens to wander 
into the heart of Orange County in perfect safety. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the closure of Interstate 5 could be extended into downtown Los 
Angeles, providing us with another stupendous benefit: the elimination of our 
daily traffic jams!

FAMILY CAUGHT IN KUWAIT FLEES TO U.S. EMBASSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Scripps Ranch family trapped in Kuwait has found refuge in the American 
Embassy there, the U.S. State Department said Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
B. George Saloom, 52, his wife Deborah, 49, and their eldest son Preston, 17, 
were transferred from a hotel to the embassy on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The family, which lives in the 10200 block of Rue Cannes, left for Kuwait three 
weeks ago. Saloom was to take a job with the Bank of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The only new information I have is that they've been switched to the American 
Embassy compound," said Scott Robinson, who is staying at the residence and 
taking care of the youngest Saloom, 14-year-old Nathan. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in a much better position right now," said Robinson. "It's much more 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson declined to give any more details of the family's situation. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the State Department has said the family was safe in a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iraq ordered all U.S. and British citizens in Kuwait into two 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman Friday said that only five of the 2,500 Americans 
in the country had obeyed the order. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Iraqi government had not backed up the order, but he 
added that it had not been rescinded either. 
</P>
<P>
The family's move comes amid news Friday that Iraq had taken 35 captive 
Americans in Baghdad from the hotel where they had been kept under armed guard 
to an undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq sealed Kuwait's borders after invading on August 2, but a few Americans 
have managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
One, Leucadia native and former Associated Press photographer Stephanie 
McGehee, 37, escaped across the border in a 13-car convoy on Friday after 
spending a week in hiding.

VASQUEZ DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your recent story regarding leadership in the county ("Leadership Void Seen as 
Peril to Measure M," Aug. 6) unfortunately missed the mark. I have to take 
exception with your criticism of the Board of Supervisors and particularly the 
heavy-handed criticism of Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
I hope in the future when you choose to give politicians a performance review, 
you talk to his constituents as opposed to people outside the district who may 
be frustrated with his independence. Frankly, the supervisors offer about as 
much leadership opportunity to any one member as a five-handed game of draw 
poker with no player holding a pair after the draw. 
</P>
<P>
As for Vasquez, we haven't always agreed with Gaddi, but as a community 
advocacy organization that works hand in hand on an almost daily basis with his 
office, we appreciate his open lines of communication, which your article 
failed to give him credit for. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman supervisor, he took hold of an embryonic program called the 
Foothill Circulation Phasing Plan. This was a very bold attempt at dealing with 
the transportation fiasco in the Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The $330-million new arterial road system paid for by the development 
community, coupled with his tough stand on implementing the new growth 
management ordinance of the county General Plan, is a clear demonstration of 
political risk-taking on behalf of community interests and his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Would Gaddi get reelected in the South County portion of the 3rd District 
today? You bet he would, and by a landslide! That's proof of leadership 
quality.

COMMISSIONER LEAVENWORTH -- HE'S HONEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your article regarding Orange County Planning Commissioner Doug Leavenworth 
and his votes affecting the Mission Viejo Co., you might have interviewed some 
people who routinely work with Doug. 
</P>
<P>
I think they would all tell you that you couldn't buy Doug off with a golf 
course, much less a golf game. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the hours and hours spent on commission duties is hardly offset by 
the pay or the perks. It is largely a grueling, thankless job. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously Doug wasn't aware of the problem since he very openly reported 
everything and could have easily abstained from voting. He has too much 
integrity and is too honest for it to be anything other than a simple 
oversight.

The building of a commercial airport on the Marine base at Pendleton or making 
El Toro a joint commercial/military field does not make sense. 
</P>
<P>
But a better alternative is available. Build a new military airfield at 
Pendleton and move the El Toro jets to that location. Also included should be 
the nearby Marine helicopter base. Most of the activities of these two groups 
are involved with exercises at Pendleton. This would save the Marines time and 
fuel costs.

LAND FIASCO -- COUNCIL IS AT FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am shocked at the article reporting on the "reversal" of Planning 
Commissioner Thomas Moody on Laguna Niguel's loss of 96 acres of public land 
("Planner Reverses Self on Public's Lost 96 Acres," Aug. 8). 
</P>
<P>
All previous plans for the development of Laguna Niguel, including the Salt 
Creek Corridor Regional Plan and the Avco Plan, provided for the wetlands on 
Taylor Woodrow's tract to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow has destroyed the Salt Creek Wetlands, which was to provide 
benefit to all citizens of Orange County, and replaced these precious wetlands 
with private pools for the exclusive use of condo owners and residents of their 
tract. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of Salt Creek Wetlands is not for the betterment of Laguna 
Niguel as quoted by Commissioner Moody. Taylor Woodrow provided a residential 
product to maximize their profits at the expense of the general populace. 
</P>
<P>
They also did not adhere to procedures that call for the filing of an 
environmental impact report when destroying wetlands such as these.

SOCIALIZED MEDICINE ISN'T THE ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Shame on County's Doctors? No, Shame on State's Medi-Cal" (Letters, Aug. 
12): Craig Myers has laser-pointed the entire society as the culprit of our 
health-care system. Our society remains a frozen embryo typifying the '80s era 
of wants without efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, everyone wants the best and latest medical care, but nobody wants to pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
However, doctors can no longer afford to shoulder what should be the society's, 
and more specifically our county's, responsibility. Most people, though, 
readily perceive that their medical expenses are too high but do not realize 
how costly it is to operate a medical office or hospital. In my own office, 
employee salaries, benefits and state-mandated assessments alone account for 
nearly 40% of my gross income. 
</P>
<P>
Since, as Myers pointed out, Medi-Cal pays hospitals an average of only 61% 
(probably even less to doctors) of the cost, we must then make up the 
difference from the others. The resultant escalation in health insurance costs 
propels yet more people out of our health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder many in our country are crying for some form of socialized medicine 
even when the socialist societies are reaching out for a solution from 
perestroika. However, to allow the politicians to control our health-care 
system is like asking the Iraqi to protect Saudi Arabia from the Kuwaiti 
Voluntary Army. Before we opt for socialized medicine, we must ask ourselves, 
"Postal Service or Federal Express?"

BERNSTINE, LEWIS HELP CHARGERS GET IT INTO GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an exhibition victory that, in itself, was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
But by defeating the Rams, 30-27, before 45,684 in Anaheim Saturday night, the 
Chargers (2-0) discovered two important things: 
</P>
<P>
1. Rod Bernstine is very capable of playing running back. 
</P>
<P>
2. Nate Lewis, a guy who made his name at the collegiate level at a little 
school named Oregon Tech, is very capable as a kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine's all-purpose performance, which included 94 rushing yards on eight 
carries and two touchdowns, allowed the Chargers to be in position to win. And 
Lewis won it. 
</P>
<P>
After the Rams had taken a 27-24 lead with 5:19 to play, Lewis did his thing on 
the ensuing kickoff, running through a huge hole created by a wedge block and 
going 87 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of play that feels pretty good to a guy who isn't sure he is a 
lock to make the final roster cut. 
</P>
<P>
"Very happy," Lewis said. "I haven't done one of those since high school. I 
wanted to show everybody what I can do and be a part of this team." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine knew he wouldn't be cut, but he kept hearing whispers that he might 
be good trade bait. That worried him. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, really, last night I didn't sleep too much," he said. "I really was 
worried about whether they were going to trade me or not. I enjoy San Diego. I 
like all the ballplayers I have been playing with, and hopefully I can stay 
here." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Bernstine has been used as an H-back and a tight end. He has 
gotten to the point where running back feels comfortable. Really, it's more a 
matter of getting the football. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime I can get my hands on the ball, I think I can benefit the team," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This game was one of many twists and turns. The boos heard by the Rams in the 
first half turned to cheers in the third quarter when Mark Herrmann, their 
third quarterback of the night, led them 80 yards in 13 plays for their first 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
With 5:10 remaining in the third quarter, backup fullback Robert Delpino took a 
Herrmann pass on the right sideline and went 14 yards for a touchdown, fending 
off a desperation push by safety Bruce Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Mark Vlasic at quarterback for the Chargers. Last week, in a 28-16 
victory over the Cowboys, Vlasic was magnificent. But when he first came in 
against the Rams, he looked exactly like a guy who has only played in two games 
in 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
Vlasic, who eventually found his touch to finish 12 of 16 for 113 yards and a 
touchdown, threw a sideline pass right into the hands of cornerback Bobby 
Humphrey, who returned it 35 yards to the Charger six. On the next play, Gaston 
Green went off left tackle for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter got a little wild. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams took a 21-17 lead on their next possession. Seventy yards, Green 
scoring from the one. Most of the guys who regularly start on defense for the 
Chargers were not on the field at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Vlasic picked up his game, completing eight of nine to lead the Chargers 76 
yards in 12 plays for 24-21 lead, completing the job with a one-yard pass to 
rookie tight end Derrick Walker with 7:57 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams again came right back, driving 67 yards in six plays, with Green 
scoring his third touchdown on a one-yard run. Mike Lansford missed the extra 
point to make it 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
After Lewis' return, John Carney missed the extra point, returning the favor. 
But the Charger defense drove the Rams back seven yards on five plays after the 
kickoff, took the ensuing punt with 4:02 left and then ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, there were a lot of favors distributed to each team by the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
The first quarter was classic exhibition football, with lots of fumbles, 
bumbles and stumbles mixed in with an occasional bit of flash. 
</P>
<P>
The starting quarterbacks, Charger Billy Joe Tolliver and Ram Jim Everett, 
threw incompletions on the game's first 11 passes, though both had help from 
slippery-fingered receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who threw for 4,310 yards last season to rank second in passing in the 
NFL behind Joe Montana, was zero for six when he was yanked in favor of Chuck 
Long with 5:43 remaining in the first quarter. Everett has yet to complete a 
pass in the United States this season. The Rams played their opener against the 
Kansas City Chiefs in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver was zero for four before he hooked up for 11 yards over the middle 
with Walker. That, with 3:55 remaining in the quarter, was the game's first 
completion. A few minutes later, Long actually completed two consecutive 
passes, one for seven yards to tight end Pat Carter and a 35-yarder down the 
right sideline to wide receiver Derrick Faison. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine lined up in the backfield with a little more than three minutes 
remaining in the quarter and gave the Chargers something to hoot about and Ram 
fans something to sulk about. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeping to his right on first and 10 from the Charger 33, Bernstine jumped 
over a pile crossing the line of scrimmage, swerved by cornerback Clifford 
Hicks and ran away from former San Diego State cornerback Alfred Jackson, who 
got only a finger or two on the back of Bernstine's jersey before he was left 
behind. Fuad Reveiz converted the extra point after Bernstine's 67-yard run to 
make it 7-0 Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
By the second quarter, the Chargers settled down, played more consistently and 
let Bernstine continue to gallop. To increase their lead to 14-0, the Chargers 
drove 53 yards in eight plays, with Bernstine rushing four times and catching 
two passes from Tolliver for 13 and four yards. Bernstine plowed over from the 
one for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Just before halftime, the Chargers drove 29 yards to the Ram 11, and Reveiz 
kicked a 27-yard field goal to make it 17-0. That drive was set up by an 
interception by Charger strong safety Martin Bayless, who hauled down a Long 
overthrow and raced up the right sideline for 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the fans didn't think much of what they saw in the first half and 
hollered a few boos at their team as they retired to the locker room for the 
break. The same thing happened when they returned to the field. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Burt Grossman, the Chargers' first-round draft selection last 
season, has switched agents and now will be represented by Mike Merkow of 
Poway. Grossman had previously been represented by Steve Feldman, who is based 
in the Los Angeles area. Feldman represents Junior Seau, the Chargers' 
first-round draft pick this season who hasn't yet agreed to a contract. "Burt 
wanted to go with somebody close by," Merkow said. "He just felt that he needed 
representation on a full-time basis." Grossman, Merkow said, will sign an 
endorsement contract today with a car dealership and Tuesday with an 
international athletic shoe company. "He is an advertiser's dream or a 
nightmare," Merkow said of Grossman, who is never at a loss for words. "But 
this kind of guy, if he is packaged properly, could do very, very well." . . . 
Outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith, hampered throughout practice this week with 
a thigh bruise, did not dress Saturday. Henry Rolling, a third-year free agent 
from Tampa Bay, started in place of Smith. Tight end Arthur Cox, who missed 
Saturday's game with a back strain, was replaced by Derrick Walker, a 
sixth-round draft choice from Michigan. ... Charger cornerback Sam Seale left 
in the second quarter with a mild quadriceps strain. . . . Nose tackle Les 
Miller left the game in the third quarter with a hyper-extended elbow and did 
not return.

DOUBLE WEDGE, DAVIS TEAM TO WIN RAMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Frankel thinks he's found the key to Double Wedge. Simply pair her with 
Robbie Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden four times by Davis this year, the 5-year-old Northern Baby mare has two 
victories, a second when she was beaten by three-quarters of a length and a 
third, when she fell a head short. 
</P>
<P>
The latest success came Saturday when Double Wedge ran down Reluctant Guest in 
the final sixteenth to score a $17.80 upset in the $270,500 Ramona Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second Grade I victory in the last three outings for Double Wedge, 
who is owned by Edmund Gann. The $158,000 prize boosted her earnings to 
$405,522. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a welcome pleasure for Davis, who hasn't had a Del Mar to remember. 
He injured his back pulling up a horse July 30, was inactive the next two weeks 
and the victory was only his second from 47 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sweet race to win," he said after Double Wedge completed the 1 1/8 
miles on turf in 1:49 and won by nearly a length. "Being the second win of the 
meet is especially sweet. 
</P>
<P>
"I got lucky. Originally, Reluctant Guest (who he had ridden to wins in the 
Beverly Hills and Wilshire at Hollywood Park) wasn't supposed to go in this 
race, so I took a call on this horse, then Reluctant Guest went in at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she was the horse to beat, so I just followed her. I had dead aim on 
her stretch, but I had to wait a little to get out. This does a lot for my 
confidence. The competition is so tough here, it's tough to be out one week, 
let alone two. I went to a therapist for my back and I still go twice a week. I 
stretch 20 minutes every morning." 
</P>
<P>
Frankel, who picked up his sixth victory of the meeting, had much more to say 
after the Ramona than he did before. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbie was looking for me to give him some instructions, but I wouldn't do 
it," he said. "This race was too confusing for me. I told him he was on his 
own. I just told him to ride his race. 
</P>
<P>
"She's had excuses in several of her races this year. Last time (when fourth as 
the 5-2 favorite in the Beverly Hills Handicap), it rained the night before and 
she couldn't get a hold of the course. When she got beat by Brown Bess (March 
31 in the Santa Barbara), she had a lot of trouble and was much the best. I'm 
not sure what's next. Maybe, the Beverly D. in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux had no excuses for Reluctant Guest, the 3-1 second choice, who 
was three lengths better than Nikishka, who beat Stylish Star by a nose for the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding for her third consecutive stakes win, Reluctant Guest got the lead with 
an eighth of a mile to go, but couldn't hold off Double Wedge. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was home," Desormeaux said. "It took a nice one to get me from 
there. She just cruised when I asked her. She just plain cooked." 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess' performance in the Ramona validated what many already thought. The 
8-year-old Petrone mare, who won the 1989 Eclipse Award as the nation's top 
female grass performer, has lost a step or two. She finished fifth as the 
122-pound highweight and 2-1 favorite in a race she won last year. 
</P>
<P>
"She was laying good, right where I wanted to be," Jack Kaenel said. "She's 
spotting these nice fillies too much weight. She carried 117 last year, 122 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mandella had to settle for second in the Ramona with Reluctant Guest, 
but he had the day's most impressive winner. 
</P>
<P>
Making the second start of her life, Centennial Time, a 3-year-old Storm Bird 
filly, beat maidens by 12 lengths in the fourth race, completing 6 1/2 furlongs 
in 1:14 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
With Desormeaux along for the ride, the even-money favorite drew clear 
immediately, set some amazing fractions (21 2/5, 43 2/5 and 1:08 1/5) and kept 
coming away. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm, Centennial Time was a troubled fourth 
in her debut July 29, but returned with a 59 2/5 work over the track last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Very well-regarded last winter at Santa Anita, Centennial Time came up with 
some problems and never started. "Everyone who's been around her has liked 
her," Mandella said. "The first time she ran, she was scared and green. She was 
pretty impressive today. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem has been getting her to cooperate and relax. She just wants to 
take off and run. We've been working at trying to get her to relax and go on." 
</P>
<P>
Companion, who finished next-to-last in the Eddie Read Handicap a week ago, 
aggravated a tendon injury and has been retired. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old bred in Argentina, Companion bowed a tendon in his American debut 
early last year and was off for some 15 months. Unbeaten in four starts in 
South America, the Allen Paulson-owned horse had a win -- in the Wickerr 
Handicap July 29 -- and a second in four starts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He re-injured the tendon," said Alex Hassinger, assistant to trainer Richard 
Lundy. "We're looking for a nice home for him to stand stud." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Double Wedge has five victories from 22 lifetime starts. . . . Kent Desormeaux 
and Alex Solis both had two wins Saturday. In addition to Centennial Time, 
Desormeaux won the first with favored Conflictofinterest and Solis won with 
Officer's Choice in the third and John's Revenge in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
A field of 10 is set for today's $300,000 Del Mar Derby, which will be run at 1 
1/8 miles on the turf. From the rail out, the field includes Aksar, Super 
Abound, Music Prospector, Itsallgreektome, Predecessor, In Excess, who will be 
adding Lasix; Mehmetori, Pro For Sure and the Ron McAnally entry of Tight Spot 
and Silver Ending. Aksar and In Excess will also run coupled.

O'NEAL, TEAM COMPROMISE ON CONTRACT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal, a Pro Bowl alternate last season, has agreed 
in principle to a two-year contract, Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard 
said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Both Beathard and O'Neal's agent, Marvin Demoff, had said the deal was close 
for the past week, but final terms weren't put in place until Beathard and 
Demoff met Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the deal won't be finalized until Demoff gets approval from 
O'Neal. Beathard was unable to reach Demoff Saturday for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was a compromise for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it worked out in the middle of where (O'Neal) wanted it and where we 
wanted it," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, who met with Beathard Wednesday at UCSD, said he has been keeping in 
shape by running. This has been his longest holdout. He missed all of the 1987 
season and half of 1988 with a knee injury. DON PATTERSON

PADRES PLAY WITH FULL DECK, DEAL DEFEAT TO PHILLIES 
</P>

<P>
It was a strange feeling for Padre Manager Greg Riddoch on Saturday afternoon 
when he sat down to make out his lineup card. He checked his injury report. He 
made sure there were no last-minute emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
And then he pinched himself. 
</P>
<P>
So this is what it's like to finally field a lineup that represents the best 
he's got. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, showing just what they're capable of with an injury-free team with 
Jack Clark back in his usual cleanup spot, and Benito Santiago behind the 
plate, knocked off the Philadelphia Phillies, 4-2, in front of a giddy crowd of 
35,145. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fans, of course, showed up only to pick up their free T-shirts, but 
on this night, nothing could squelch the Padres' enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
This was the lineup that last had been intact on June 13, one manager, two 
coaches and 10 transactions ago. And, oh, what a difference it makes when Clark 
is batting cleanup, and Joe Carter and Santiago are sitting in the bottom of 
your order. 
</P>
<P>
"You get two or three of those guys hacking," Riddoch said, "and it could be 
dangerous. I'd like to keep putting that lineup on the field and see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
It was Clark, who was back in the lineup as the Padres' cleanup hitter for the 
first time since Aug. 9, who once again showed his vitality to the Padre 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had managed just 10 runs and three extra-base hits in their previous 
51 innings when Clark stepped to the plate in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Stephenson, who led off the inning with a bunt single, was standing on 
third base. Tony Gwynn, who had a two-out single, was on first. Tommy Greene, 
who was making his first career start with the Phillies, was on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Clark worked the count to 3-2 on Greene. He was about to throw the next pitch 
when Phillie first baseman John Kruk came to the mound, and reminded him to 
keep Gwynn close to the first-base bag. Greene nodded, and re-focused his 
attention on Clark. 
</P>
<P>
He could walk him, of course, loading the bases. But the trouble was that 
Carter was the man on-deck, owner of a league-high 94 RBIs and 20 homers, 
including two grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
Greene decided to throw a strike, a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Clark hit a line drive that never got 25 feet above the ground, not stopping 
until it slammed off the left-field seats for a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
Greene stayed in the game just long enough to see shortstop Dickie Thon slip 
while trying to field Carter's ground ball, allowing him to reach first. Darrel 
Akerfelds relieved, but Carter greeted him rudely by stealing second and going 
to third on catcher Darren Daulton's error. Santiago walked, and Carter came in 
with an insurance run on Mike Pagliarulo's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the phenomena is," Riddoch said, "but when he (Clark) is 
going good, everyone else is, too. It's been that way throughout his career. 
When he hits, everybody else hits." 
</P>
<P>
It all was enough to provide Andy Benes (9-8) with just his third victory since 
June 4, while the Padres scored their most runs in a victory against a National 
League East team since July 15. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, baby, it's sure been a long wait, but the way Riddoch figures it, why 
mope about the last three months when you can find out for yourself just what 
these guys are capable of the final six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll know more about our strengths and weaknesses," said Riddoch, gearing 
for the 1991 season considering that the Padres, 56-62, still are 12 games 
behind the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd think by September we'd like to make some evaluations on what direction 
we'd like to go." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, if Riddoch can retain a blueprint from Saturday's game, perhaps the 
Padres finally can live up to their preseason expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Really, it was just like they diagrammed in spring training. Andy Benes -- who 
was expected to be the ace of the staff this season although he won't turn 23 
until Monday -- allowed just two runs in six innings. They got two innings of 
shutout middle relief by Rich Rodriguez and bullpen ace, Greg Harris, who has 
not allowed a run in 16 innings. And Craig Lefferts, the man who was supposed 
to subside the pain of losing Mark Davis, made it look easy by pitching a 1-2-3 
ninth inning for his 19th save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
You know it was a banner night for the Padres when they go a complete game 
without making an error, handling 13 balls in the infield flawlessly. They even 
pulled off the unusual 5-6-3 play for the second consecutive night when Kruk's 
ground ball bounced off Pagliarulo's glove, to shortstop Garry Templeton, who 
threw to first base for the out. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rare night for everyone in the Padre clubhouse to cherish, but perhaps 
more than anyone, it was Benes who most relished the victory. 
</P>
<P>
This is a kid who was being billed this spring as the ace of the Padre staff. 
He was good enough to make the Olympic Team, be selected as the No. 1 pick in 
all of the land in the 1988 June free agent draft and go 6-3 in his 54-day 
stint last season, so why not have him carry the burden, right? 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough on him," said Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach. "It seems like 
it's been just one thing after another, after another. It just hasn't been a 
normal year for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's basically persevered, and hasn't turned into a recluse or anything, but 
there's sure been a lot of bull . . . he's had to endure. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I'm proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
Benes earlier this season had to overcome a strange ailment that resulted in 
the loss of skin on his pitching hand, and then had overcome a pain in his left 
shoulder that occurred in July after a pushing incident with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. He was making his first start since Aug. 7 after leaving the team for 
a few days because of a domestic problem. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest problems arose because of his failure to get out Kruk, who tripled 
and scored in the second inning, and singled and scored in the fourth. But 
otherwise, Benes was just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see," Riddoch said, "his time will come." 
</P>
<P>
Who knows, maybe with this lineup, so will the Padres'. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hollins, the Padres' third baseman of the future until they made the grave 
mistake of not protecting him in the 1989 winter draft, is doing just fine in 
the Philadelphia Phillies organization where they too predict stardom. Hollins, 
drafted for $50,000 without any compensation, has made just 75 plate 
appearances for the Phillies, batting .162 with four homers and eight RBIs. But 
by being on the major league roster the entire season, the Phillies are not 
required to offer him back for a price of $25,000. "It's a shame he hasn't 
played much," said Lee Thomas, Phillie general manager, "but we got him for the 
future. It may take a year or two, but we think he'll be a good one." Hollins, 
24, is expected to play winter ball during the off-season, and then likely will 
start at third base next season for the triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre club. 
"If he plays well, who knows, he may be back with us for next year," Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a year makes? The Padres are 16-18 in one-run decisions this 
season, and 11-15 in two-run decisions, a combined total of 27-33. A year ago, 
they were 30-18 in one-run games, and 22-15 in two-run decisions, a combined 
total of 52-33. That translates into a .450 winning percentage in one- and 
two-run games in 1990 compared to a .612 winning percentage in 1989, a 
difference of 26 victories over the course of a 162-game season. . . . His 
loving Padre teammates pulled a gag on rookie pitcher Rich Rodriguez by 
substituting Calvin Schiraldi's uniform top in his locker. Rodriguez 
unsuspectingly put on the uniform, walked to the bullpen, and then realized 
that something didn't quite feel right. He pulled the top of his jersey around 
to see the name, and then winced in anguish. He was forced to take the long 
walk back to the clubhouse, via the tunnel, and change jerseys. . . . Jack 
Clark and Joe Carter each have 20 homers this season, marking the first time 
since 1986 that the Padres have had two players hit 20 homers in the same 
season. Kevin McReynolds (26) and Steve Garvey (21) were the last to accomplish 
the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn went three for four, taking another chunk out of Phillie center 
fielder Lenny Dykstra's National League batting lead. Gwynn raised his average 
to .320, and Dykstra went one for five, dropping to .344. . . . The Phillies 
have 12 complete games by their pitching staff this season; they had 10 all of 
last year. . . . The Phillies' defeat ended their season-high four-game winning 
streak. They have not had a longer winning streak since 1988. . . . The 
Phillies have a league-high nine players who have at least 30 RBIs this season; 
the Padres have seven. . . . The Padres will complete their three-game series 
against the Phillies at 1:05 p.m. today when Dennis Rasmussen (8-11) is 
scheduled to face Pat Combs (6-8). The Padres then will finish their home stand 
with a three-game series beginning Monday against the New York Mets. The 
pitching match-ups: Bruce Hurst (7-8) vs. Sid Fernandez (8-9) on Monday; Ed 
Whitson (9-7) vs. Ron Darling (5-7) Tuesday, and Calvin Schiraldi (3-5) vs. 
Frank Viola (15-8) on Wednesday.

CONFLICTING IMAGES CATCH HENDERSON'S STYLE, SUBSTANCE

Getting a reading on the uneven, almost-schizophrenic personality Rickey 
Henderson wears publicly is a task comparable to trying to have a baseball at 
second base before the game's steals king-to-be arrives with his headfirst 
lunge of calculated fury. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson provides few hints to his true character, though every catcher in the 
American League knows he has supreme confidence in his abilities. During 
virtually every at-bat he offers clenched-teeth pledges that, he says, go 
something like: "I'm gonna get on and steal second and third, and make you look 
real bad. And there ain't nothing you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics' moody, multifaceted and often-misunderstood outfielder 
rarely is viewed in shades of gray. He has alternately worn the hats of villian 
and hero during his sometimes-glorious, sometimes-stormy 12 years in the major 
leagues. At 31, he is in the midst of his finest season and closing in on 
baseball's career stolen base record -- and perhaps the American League's most 
valuable player award as well. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the most accurate depiction of Rickey Henderson? 
</P>
<P>
a Is it the apparent malcontent who groused this season that he's underpaid at 
more than $3 million a year, of whose reputation A's officials were so wary 
that they consulted extensively with several of their club's veteran players 
before trading for him in June 1989? Is it the primping, preening prima donna 
who has been accused of failing to play through minor injuries, admits he 
doesn't think it's necessary to run out every ground ball full tilt and first 
unveiled his trademark "snatch catch" at the dubious moment of the final out of 
a no-hitter by Mike Warren in 1983? 
</P>
<P>
Or is it the fiercely loyal kid at heart who vehemently defends his former New 
York Yankees boss, George Steinbrenner, and can't talk about his most beloved 
manager, the late Billy Martin, without choking on the words, misty-eyed? 
</P>
<P>
With this version goes Oakland Manager Tony La Russa's favorite Henderson tale: 
La Russa brought Henderson into his office one day after the A's acquired him 
last year. The manager interrupted Henderson's patching-up speech about former 
conflicts between the two, telling Henderson he wanted to earn his respect. 
</P>
<P>
After Henderson concluded one of the most torrid postseasons in memory and the 
A's swept the San Francisco Giants in the World Series, Henderson made it a 
point to seek out La Russa during the postgame celebration and let him know 
respect had been earned. "It's mutual," La Russa said here this week. "You hear 
a lot of innuendo about Rickey Henderson, but the guy I know is a consummate 
professional and a good human being." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKING UP THE TALK 
</P>
<P>
La Russa likes to say Henderson would be elected mayor of the A's if such a 
post existed. And indeed, the Henderson portrait painted by his current 
teammates is flattering. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a perfect fit here," said third baseman Carney Lansford, one of two 
A's whose tenure with the team dates back to the first of Henderson's two 
stints here. "He plays hard every day. He's intense. He plays hurt. To me, he's 
a different guy than he was when he was here before. I think it's maturity. He 
was our spark plug from the moment he stepped into this clubhouse (last 
season)." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson insists he's indifferent about his image, but he can't resist 
launching into occasional tirades about expectations that increase 
disproportionately with each accomplishment. "What do people want from me?" he 
asked. "I give what I have, which usually is a lot, and the critics out there 
still aren't satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
He can be outlandish, as when he suggested the A's perhaps should have a 
Lamborghini awaiting him as a gift when he breaks Lou Brock's stolen base 
record. He can be surly, as is the case when he's asked to respond to charges 
he doesn't play hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But always, he's productive. He's batting an AL-best .330 with 21 home runs, 44 
RBI and the league's second-highest slugging percentage at .592. He has 49 
stolen bases in 55 attempts, leaving him one short of achieving the 50-steal 
mark for the 10th time. Only Brock, who swiped 50 or more 12 times in 18 
seasons, has done so more often. 
</P>
<P>
He's had five years of 16 or more homers -- including a high of 28 -- and six 
with 80 or more steals, topped by a record 130 in 1982. He has a major-league 
record 44 home runs leading off games, four of them this year. 
</P>
<P>
He's 19 stolen bases short of surpassing Brock for the top spot among 
baseball's all-time steals leaders, and he'll break the record in about 1,000 
fewer games. He has said he can reach 1,200 to 1,500 steals; Brock got 938. 
</P>
<P>
He is the most annoying, occupying, disruptive force in the game. A convincing 
case can be made that he's among the best leadoff hitters baseball has seen; 
certainly, he's the finest of his era. He also may be the best defensive left 
fielder today. 
</P>
<P>
And he is the leading mogul of style on the team that loves to swagger -- 
exuding charisma with everything from his neon batting glove to his stalling, 
mind-game rituals at the plate to his nonchalant patrolling of the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring from second base on a routine groundout is a once-per-season feat, and 
Baltimore Orioles Manager Frank Robinson promises he won't soon forget the time 
Henderson tagged up and raced home from third on a popout to shortstop Cal 
Ripken. "He's the ultimate pest," Robinson said as his team dropped two of 
three to the A's here this week, though Henderson missed the final two games 
because he strained his left hamstring running to first on a groundout Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The A's know they have grown so dependent upon Henderson that they can ill 
afford to lose him for an extended period. He adds the dimension La Russa calls 
"Rickey Runs"-the ability to score on a walk, two steals and a groundout or fly 
ball. The A's are resisting putting him on the 15-day disabled list now for 
fear he'll be ready to play a few days earlier and they'll miss out on his 
services unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
It is a stature he carries proudly. "It's nice to be appreciated," he said. "I 
feel like I'm respected for what I do here. That hasn't always been the case 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EMOTIONAL STRENGTH 
</P>
<P>
Riches and adulation did not come easily to Henderson. He was born in Chicago, 
the youngest of five sons and two daughters raised by his mother and 
grandmother. The family lived in Arkansas from when Rickey was 2 until he was 
7, then settled in a working-class neighborhood in Oakland. He grew up playing 
baseball with A's teammate Dave Stewart and Detroit Tigers outfielder Lloyd 
Moseby. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson never knew his father, who left his mother when he was 2. A lifelong 
curiosity culminated in 1979, when he hired private detectives to find his 
father, who was a truck driver. Shortly after the detectives located the elder 
Henderson, he died in a traffic accident. They reported that to Henderson's 
mother, Bobbie, who couldn't bring herself to tell Rickey until more than a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Henderson says he never lacked for support. His base-stealing proficiency 
was rooted in his mother's protective nature, for she never believed he had 
been playing baseball on the sandlots unless he came home dirty. So Henderson 
learned how to stain himself, lest he face the wrath of punishment for 
suspected carousing on the street. 
</P>
<P>
The knack was nurtured further by a kind-hearted high school counselor who 
offered a quarter for every base he stole -- a front for providing him with 
enough money to buy lunch every day, Henderson says. "I never lacked for strong 
people in my life," he said. "I was always looked after and provided for, with 
generosity and understanding instead of with money." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson was an all-city running back in football, with power and 4.3-second 
speed in the 40-yard dash that drew scholarship offers from major schools. He 
was set to go to Arizona State on a football scholarship when the A's drafted 
him and his mother persuaded him, despite his objections, to opt for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He skyrocketed through the minors with his imposing raw ability and the 
base-running tutorials of his rookie league manager, Tom Trebelhorn. Now the 
manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, Trebelhorn added technique to speed, and 
Henderson learned to become a student of base-stealing. He has since borrowed 
from the methods of Brock, Davey Lopes and others, and he now says physical 
skills are secondary to cunning. 
</P>
<P>
"I steal bases with my mind as much as with my legs," he said. "It's me against 
the pitcher out there. If I get the jump I want, the catcher doesn't have any 
chance. ... That's why I like to mess with (the catchers). ... I taunt them, 
tell them they couldn't throw me out if I walked over to second. But that's 
just for fun. Really, my rivalry is with the pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUDDING CAREER 
</P>
<P>
His most carefree seasons were his early years with the A's, days of "Billy 
Ball" under Martin that consisted of few restrictions on his running or 
behavior. When Martin was killed in a traffic accident on Henderson's birthday, 
Christmas Day, the former pupil said he was devastated. 
</P>
<P>
Martin had played the biggest part in bringing Henderson -- with pitcher Bert 
Bradley -- to the Yankees in a 1985 trade for Jay Howell, Jose Rijo, Eric 
Plunk, Tim Birtsas and Stan Javier. 
</P>
<P>
His Yankees years were mostly fruitful, as he became one of the game's most 
feared players. But he often felt unduly reined, he said, and the situation 
there began to sour in 1987 when he missed 67 games with a torn hamstring. 
Manager Lou Piniella and almost everyone else associated with the Yankees -- 
except for Martin -- didn't believe Henderson was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was traded back here last year for Luis Polonia, Greg Cadaret 
and (again) Plunk, New York officials were proclaiming him past his prime and 
uninterested in performing to his potential. Henderson vetoed a proposed deal 
with the Giants, and the Yankees conceded they probably didn't get equal value 
in dealing him to Oakland. The A's trepidations about him were alleviated 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting .247 the first 2 1/2 months of the season for New York, Henderson 
batted .294 for Oakland as the A's pulled away from the California Angels down 
the stretch. Then he made the postseason his personal showcase, subduing 
Toronto with a six-for-15, seven-walk, eight-steal performance and pestering 
San Francisco with a .474 average in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm healthy, I feel I'm unstoppable," said Henderson, who has played much 
of this year with a sore hip. "The problem is, people never know when you're 
not healthy. In New York, I always had managers telling me, 'Your 80 percent is 
better than other people's 100 percent.' So I gave the 80 I had in me. But then 
I'd be criticized because it wasn't 100 percent, when only a few people knew 
that I wasn't physically capable of that at the time." 
</P>
<P>
So, finally, which is the real Henderson? Even now, it depends upon whom you 
ask. There still are those players and scouts around the league who accuse him 
of being lazy, showy and more unnerving to his team than others. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, though, that is not the prevailing opinion on the Henderson of 1990. 
He says he'll probably seek to renegotiate his just-signed, four-year contract 
after the season, but any unhappiness about his salary hasn't showed in his 
play. And his antics are more for entertainment than anything else anyway, La 
Russa contends, adding that the substance underneath makes all of it 
worthwhile. "He breaks up the monotony," La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always have people tearing me down," Henderson said. "I don't let it 
bother me anymore. I just try to be myself. You can take it or leave it. I 
think the guys in this clubhouse will take me as I am."

VELODROME'S DENMAN HELPS CALL SHOTS ON SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sports is full of stories about top athletes who owe a lot to their dedicated 
parents (face it, schlepping a junior jock to practices and games is almost a 
full-time job). 
</P>
<P>
But this story is different -- it's about a top athlete who owes a lot to his 
parents for not getting involved. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents weren't the type to drive us anywhere," says Rick Denman, a 
down-to-earth, 32-year-old cyclist who finished seventh in his age group in the 
recent U. S. National Masters cycling championships in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At 13, Denman faced the logistic problem of getting from his east Detroit home 
to a Little League diamond eight miles away. The answer was inside his garage: 
a single-speed Stingray, an ancestor of the BMX bike. Once he began making 
those long bike trips, baseball was no longer his favorite sport. Soon, the 
Stingray was replaced by a five-speed Schwinn -- and Denman began competing in 
races for the Wolverine Sports Club. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't turn into Greg LeMond, Denman has managed to do something 
extremely rare in cycling: make it a profitable career. He earns a steady 
income as the program director of the Encino Velodrome, but his biggest paydays 
are the result of his camera work in cycling movies and TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the Miller Beer "Tour de Lite?" Actor Woody Harrelson wins the race by 
managing to get lost in the Manhattan sewer system, but it's Denman-hired 
cyclists who do all the spectacular road riding and Denman bike-mounted cameras 
that provide all the point-of-view action shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found my niche," says Denman, who calls his production company Bikes, 
Camera, Action. 
</P>
<P>
Denman's career evolved just as serendipitously as his introduction to cycling. 
In 1979, he was competing on high-banked indoor ovals in the Midwest when 
Universal Pictures put out a casting call for experienced cyclists to serve as 
extras in the remake of the 1934 Shirley Temple movie "Little Miss Marker." 
Denman was hired and went on location in Northern California. That's when he 
caught the bug -- not for acting but for camera work. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Matthau, starring in the movie, noticed Denman's fascination with the 
camera "and encouraged me to stay in California and become a cameraman," Denman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Denman moved to Los Angeles but couldn't crack the camera operators' union. In 
the early 1980s, he competed in Europe and worked as an assistant cycling coach 
under Ron Skarin and Cliff Halsey at Cal State Dominguez Hills. Skarin, a top 
cyclist, "was one of my heroes," Denman says. "He took me under his wing." 
</P>
<P>
But while Denman enjoyed the European experience, he also came to realize that 
racing was a dead end, a grind that produced a lot of aches but no security. 
"I'd been racing for about 10 years and started to think, 'I've done it all and 
this is the best I would do,' " Denman says. 
</P>
<P>
Then, one day in '82, Denman found inspiration. "This kid comes along" at 
Dominguez Hills, Denman says. The kid was David Brinton, a young BMX racer who 
wanted to learn Olympic-style cycling. Just as Skarin had been for him, Denman 
was Brinton's mentor. Within six months, Brinton had won national junior 
championships in road and track racing, and he later rode individual pursuit 
for the '88 U. S. Olympic team in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely gratifying," to see Brinton develop, Denman says. With 
renewed zest for cycling, Denman saw his role as a teacher more clearly. "When 
you start working with new people, their enthusiasm is contagious," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Denman's reputation as a teacher got around. In 1985, when the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation was looking for someone in cycling to help spend thousands of its 
Olympic-surplus dollars, Denman was chosen. "We made inquiries with the U. S. 
Cycling Federation and Southern California Olympians," says Keith Cruickshank, 
AAF program director, "and most of them pointed to Rick." 
</P>
<P>
Before he was hired to run the AAF program at the Encino Velodrome, Denman was 
asked to submit a step-by-step lesson plan for teaching youngsters to cycle on 
a banked oval. His 15-page instructional manual, covering everything from chain 
tension to bumping techniques, got him the job. The youth program at Encino, 
now in its fourth year, has taught hundreds of kids, including several junior 
national champions. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a downside to finding and developing talent, Denman says. "You get 
somebody good and all of a sudden the national-team coaches grab him, he 
disappears from the area and you don't get to work with him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-'80s, Denman was established as a teacher -- he was the cycling 
coach in the 1987 Olympic Festival -- and as the cycling expert to whom 
Hollywood turned. Aside from developing unique camera mounts that enabled him 
to ride in the pack and shoot the action, Denman tutored actors for cycling 
scenes in such major movie releases as "American Flyers" and "Quicksilver." 
</P>
<P>
"I never had much respect for the acting profession until I saw how much effort 
Kevin Bacon put into learning to ride a bike in 'Quicksilver,' " Denman says. 
</P>
<P>
Denman's Hollywood connection has been sporadic -- "I never know when I'll get 
my next job" -- but it has been lucrative. "Coaching is steady income," he 
says, but camera work "is gravy, my play money." His play money enabled him to 
buy a house in North Hollywood in 1986, just before the boom in real estate, 
and his equity quickly shot into six figures. 
</P>
<P>
Cycling certainly has been good to Denman -- where might he be today had he 
taken a bus to Little League practice? -- and it paid off once again in 1988. 
Denman was on a long ride in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains when he 
saw a "for sale" sign on a desolate stretch of Lopez Canyon Road in Sylmar. He 
wound up buying the house, which is on five rugged, hilly acres adjacent to the 
Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"I never would have known about that place if I hadn't been riding my bike," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
With no neighbors within shouting distance, the place is as lonely as all of 
L.A. used to be 100 years ago, but it fits Denman's life style. "I'm not into 
the Hollywood scene," he says. "I don't do clubs -- I don't like smoke and I'm 
not into crowds, as you can see." 
</P>
<P>
Denman has big plans for both his property -- he eventually wants to use it as 
a training center for young cyclists -- and the velodrome. At his home 
recently, he unfurled a detailed rendering of a multiuse velodrome that 
includes a roller-blade rink and track. The AAF will consider the $700,000 
renovation sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
That Denman has been able to make a solid career out of cycling doesn't 
surprise his former mentor, Skarin, who now works as a building inspector for 
the city of Los Angeles. "I'm jealous," Skarin says good-naturedly. "He makes 
as much as I do, and he has fun."

DESPITE FLU, CRAN FLIES TO SPORTSMAN WIN AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When 24 Sportsman division drivers try to race around a one-third-mile paved 
oval, weird things are likely to happen, as a crowd of 3,418 at Saugus Speedway 
discovered Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a massive pileup in Turn 1 of Lap 1 forced Gary Sigman of Carson 
from the race and sent Quartz Hill's Pat Mintey Jr., Tarzana's Will Harper and 
Torrance's Keith Spangler to the back of the pack. It also forced a restart. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Hooper of Palmdale, though driving with a severely damaged front end, 
eventually grabbed a what looked to be a convincing lead on Lap 12 and appeared 
headed to victory. 
</P>
<P>
But John Cran of Reseda, suffering from the flu to the extent that he had to 
"chug a bottle of Pepto" to stay racing, sneaked past Hooper on Turn 4 of Lap 
39 to steal a 40-lap main-event win. 
</P>
<P>
"I let Lance go because his car was working good and mine wasn't," Cran said 
after his fourth main-event win of the year. "But I just stayed behind him, got 
a little adrenaline, and said, 'Please, let something happen, let something 
happen.' When, all of a sudden, there you have it." 
</P>
<P>
What happened was that Hooper, in pursuit of his first main-event win of the 
year, slowed down to avoid a lapped car that was spinning. Cran, seeing 
daylight, zipped past him and raced the remaining lap to victory. Hooper took 
second and appeared none too social in the pits afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess Lance is feeling pretty small right now," Cran said. "But, hey, sorry, 
dude. I could use the bucks right now." 
</P>
<P>
Mintey took third and Larry Krieger of Reseda placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Street Stock oval points standings were especially congested before 
Saturday night's races, the 25-lap oval main event took on a higher degree of 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
After all, just 12 points separated leader Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley (152) 
from fourth-place driver and defending champion Steve Nikolai of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Rayburn submitted a bid for year-end supremacy with his fifth main-event 
win. Starting third in a 24-car field, Rayburn sneaked past Ed Horst of Reseda 
on Lap 6 and never relinquished the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Four times the Street Stock drivers were held up by yellow flags, giving 
runner-up Brian Kelley of Arleta extra chances to catch Rayburn. But each time 
the race retarted, Rayburn's No. 18 car distanced itself from the challenger's 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Renno of Canoga Park took third in the oval main.

PO'S TENNIS PREDICAMENT: TO TURN PRO OR NOT TO TURN PRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bright women like Kim Po usually don't have trouble making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But the choice facing Po these days isn't one of life's easier questions. 
</P>
<P>
Po is a former national scholar-athlete at Miraleste High. Heading into her 
sophomore year at UCLA, Po has been playing as an amateur on the women's pro 
tennis tour this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at her results, you could say she likes the tour so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to play as much as I can to keep my rankings up," Po said. 
</P>
<P>
This week during doubles competition at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles at 
the Manhattan Beach Country Club, Po has been teaming with an archrival from 
her junior high and high school days, Alysia May. 
</P>
<P>
Po, 18, and the May, 19, got a wild card into this week's doubles draw and 
pulled off a couple of upsets. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, they faced the veteran team of Camille Benjamin and Anne Minter. 
Po and May fell behind quickly, losing the first set, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
But May started hitting crisp ground strokes and Po played some aggressive 
serve-and-volley tennis and the team rallied to beat Benjamin and Minter, 4-6, 
6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really aggressive match," Po said. "We were moving around a lot on 
our serves and our service returns." 
</P>
<P>
Po and May beat another veteran team -- South Africa's Elna Reinach and 
Australian Nicole Provis -- on Thursday, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
They lost in Friday's quarterfinals, 5-7, 5-7, to Elise Burgin and Rosalyn 
Fairbank-Nideffer, but Po is looking at the defeat as another learning 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
The question facing Po is: To turn pro or not to turn pro? 
</P>
<P>
For years one of the nation's top junior players, Po has a lengthy tennis 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
She won the Junior U.S. Open twice, was a member of the 1987 Junior Wrightman 
Cup team and toured Australia the same year as part of the USA team in the 
McDonald's Challenge Cup. 
</P>
<P>
At Miraleste, Po was a four-year starter. Miraleste won national prep 
championships in 1987 and 1988 with Po as one of its top singles players: Po 
won the CIF 4-A Division singles title as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Po's singles record was an amazing 60-0. The previous year she had 
a mark of 65-1, with the only loss coming in a 6-0 defeat to May -- Los Angeles 
Westlake's ace player -- in the 4-A championships at the West End Tennis Club 
in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only time I've beaten Kim," May said. "She beat me every time we 
played each other in juniors." 
</P>
<P>
Po won her first collegiate tournament last year as a freshman at UCLA -- the 
Rolex Intercollegiate Tennis Championships at UC Irvine in October -- so she 
has some solid amateur credentials. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take the 5-foot-3 Po long to win her first pro title, either. 
</P>
<P>
She won the 1989 USTA Circuit event in Fayetteville, N.C., shortly after 
graduating from high school. She defeated Laura Glitz, Susan Leo, Sandra Cacic, 
Tami Whitlinger, and Rene Simpson to win the title and watched her singles 
ranking rise to No. 232 by September. 
</P>
<P>
But she had to turn over the Fayetteville winner's check to maintain her 
amateur status. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Po has won more than $11,000 on the pro circuit, none of which she 
could accept. 
</P>
<P>
But if you ask her when she's planning to accept some of those paychecks, Po 
shakes her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," she said. "I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Po is a very serious student. At Miraleste, she was a homecoming and prom court 
princess and won the Army Reserve national scholar-athlete award. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a strong family attachment to UCLA. Both of Po's parents -- 
Jonathan, a radiologist, and mother Harriet -- attended UCLA. Po's brother Greg 
was a ranked junior player and is a junior at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
So you can count on UCLA women's tennis Coach Bill Zaima having Po somewhere in 
his lineup this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably play No. 1, 2, or 3 singles," Po said. "Who knows? We usually 
don't have a set lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Po had a lot of success early last season for UCLA, but her season ended early 
after she developed tendinitis in an elbow. 
</P>
<P>
She recovered in time to play doubles with May at the Pilkington Glass Ladies' 
Championships in Eastbourne, England, and a week later at Wimbledon. Both 
times, Po and May lost in the qualifying rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Po and May have been good friends since they were 13 and they share a unique 
chemistry on the doubles court. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan on playing a lot of tournaments together," Po said. "We plan ahead on 
playing with each other if we know that we'll be at the same tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Po and the freckle-faced, ponytailed May -- who turned pro in April -- seem to 
genuinely enjoy playing together, often sharing laughs with each other between 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be able to play with somebody that you're really good friends 
with," May said. "Kim and I can be serious when we have to be, but we can also 
joke around." 
</P>
<P>
Their partnership has also taken them far from home -- to England this summer 
and to Mexico last summer, where they won a doubles tournament in Puerto 
Vallarta and were runners-up in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good blend," Po said. "We don't yell at each other if we miss points 
because we're friends. Everybody misses the ball sometimes, and if you yell at 
them for it, it makes tension. No one's perfect."

FRANCO DOING HIS PART TO DELIVER A HIT PERFORMANCE FOR PEORIA

<P>
Bing and Lou Russell shifted uncomfortably in their seats, growing ever more 
irate as the heckler, a few rows back, continued his relentless diatribe. The 
target was the first baseman for the visiting Peoria (Ill.) Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, number nine, hustle to your position," the man yelled in a thick Latino 
accent. "You're better than that, nine. Stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 happened to be Matt Franco, the Russells' grandson. Finally, they had 
heard enough. Lou turned to confront the loudmouth, then gasped in 
astonishment. It was her son, Kurt Russell, doing one of his better acting 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, best known for his roles in such films as "Silkwood," "Escape From New 
York" and "The Best of Times," had only the best of intentions, however. He 
wanted to fire up Franco without revealing his identity. No one knew Kurt was 
at the game in Rockford, Ill., not even his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard him for a while, and when the inning ended, I looked up and it was 
Kurt," Franco said. "He was dressed to conceal his identity. He's gotta go 
incognito." 
</P>
<P>
Franco, whose mother Jill is Kurt's sister, rapidly is establishing his own 
identity. A 6-foot-3 left-handed hitter from Westlake High, Franco is 
challenging for the Midwest League batting title. With 13 games to play, he is 
batting .290, 15 points behind league-leader Scott Cepicky of South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Franco has batted .382 the past month for the Chicago Cubs' Class-A affiliate 
after beginning the season in a horrendous slump. 
</P>
<P>
Like any 20-year-old from Southern California, Franco saw his spirits -- and 
batting average -- rise along with the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"The first few weeks were ridiculous. Some nights it was 18 degrees with the 
wind-chill factor," Franco said. "Who can hit when your hands are numb?" 
</P>
<P>
Bedeviled: They have used pitches rather than pitchforks, but two former 
Arizona State Sun Devils have helped toss former Camarillo High right-hander 
Travis Willis from Peoria's starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs assigned Lance Dickson, their 1990 No. 1 draft choice out of Arizona 
State, to Peoria on July 4. After four starts, Dickson was promoted. He is now 
with the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Dickson at Peoria was Troy Bradford, the team's third-round draft 
pick, also out of Arizona State. About the same time, Manager Greg Mahlberg 
decided to stick with a four-man rotation after using five starters much of the 
season. All of which left Willis in long relief. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Willis seemed an odd choice for banishment to the bullpen. The 
former Cal standout was 8-9 with an earned-run average of 3.18 in 20 starts for 
the Chiefs (49-77), who are last in the Midwest League. With five complete 
games he still ranks among league leaders and he has walked only 39 in 154 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My control worked against me," Willis said. "They told me I'm a guy they can 
count on to come in and throw strikes. I was a better candidate for the bullpen 
than somebody who can't find the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Willis has been hit hard in relief -- he is now 9-11 with a 3.49 ERA -- and 
Mahlberg might be having a change of heart. Willis got a start against Waterloo 
(Iowa) on Friday night and gave up one earned run, getting the win in the 
Chiefs' 5-2 victory.

Holy Toledo: How Scott Muckey made his professional coaching debut at age 37 is 
basically a travel story. Certainly, it's circuitous. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Toledo (Ohio) Mud Hens, John Wockenfuss, was afraid to fly, 
so he was told to hit the road. The lone coach, Aurelio Rodriguez, had family 
problems in Mexico, so he took off south of the border, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gamboa, the new Mud Hen manager, called Muckey, a longtime friend, July 18 
and asked if he had two months to spare. Muckey was on the next flight to 
Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me all of a few seconds to make the decision," said Muckey, who had 
planned to spend the summer in his usual manner -- coaching an American Legion 
team and helping out at baseball camps. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, the Crespi High coach, has been at the high school or junior college 
levels since his playing career ended at Pepperdine in 1974. All of a sudden, 
he found himself pitching batting practice and coaching first base for the 
Detroit Tigers' triple-A International League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
In Muckey's first game, Toledo played Oklahoma City, which coincidentally is 
managed by Steve Smith, a friend of Muckey's. "He was kind of surprised to see 
me," Muckey said. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie coach trotted out to the first-base coach's box. The first Toledo 
batter singled . . . and was promptly picked off. The next Toledo batter 
doubled . . . and was picked off. Two innings later, a Toledo batter singled . 
. . and was picked off. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Smitty's over there in the dugout laughing at me," Muckey recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey has earned respect with his understated manner and knowledge of the 
game. Yet he is a mere chick among the Mud Hens in terms of professional 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made all the rookie mistakes. Just trying to keep track of the time 
schedule is hard enough," he said, chuckling. "I was running out there with my 
uniform on when we were supposed to be in batting practice tops." 
</P>
<P>
Another day he forgot his cap. "If they were serious about fining me, they 
could have slapped me for $150 for not being in the right place at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The fans have been less forgiving. During a game in Richmond, Va., Muckey 
fielded a foul ball down the first-base line and tossed it to the ball boy. 
</P>
<P>
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd was all over me," he said. "I don't know why. But now when a ball 
comes near me, I watch it roll by." 
</P>
<P>
The season itself is flying by. Muckey is enjoying every minute, but after a 
month beating around the bush leagues, he paints a less-than-romantic picture: 
Sit around a hotel room until 3 or 4 p.m., head to the ballpark, try to wind 
down after midnight. The next day, ditto. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the pro life's for everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably a lot of kids looking to be pro players are in for a little bit of a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, not being much for night life, has used his time in the hotel room to 
prepare for his Crespi teaching duties -- school begins Sept. 3, one day after 
the Mud Hens' season ends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm studying up on physiology," he said without enthusiasm. "That's what they 
have me teaching this year."

MCCOLLUM ADDED TO NORTHRIDGE STAFF;

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FORMER CARPINTERIA HIGH COACH FILLS ONE OF TWO VACANT 
ASSISTANT'S POSITIONS.

<P>
Cal State Northridge didn't have to go far to find a full-time assistant coach 
for its men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Tom McCollum, the boys' basketball coach at Carpinteria High for the past three 
seasons, has agreed to fill the CSUN position vacated by Rusty Smith, who 
resigned in June to take a similar post at Eastern Washington of the Big Sky 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Smith held the CSUN job for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Although his Carpinteria teams compiled an unimpressive 24-46 record during his 
stint at the Tri-Valley League school, McCollum has several years of collegiate 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
From 1985-87, he was an assistant at Santa Barbara City College. He was an 
assistant coach for the UC Santa Barbara men's team during the 1983-84 season 
and for the women's team from 1984-85. Before that, he was an assistant at 
Chapman College from 1973-81 and a part-time assistant for Utah during the 
1982-83 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased to have Tom McCollum as a primary member of my staff," 
Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said in a release from the CSUN sports 
information office. "Tom has had extensive experience at various levels of 
basketball and is extremely dedicated. . . . He has been so dedicated to the 
game for so long; he has a lot of networking type of things that are essential 
to the recruiting process." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which will make its NCAA Division I debut on the road against 
Colorado on Nov. 23, is still expected to hire a part-time assistant to replace 
Dave Fehte. 
</P>
<P>
Fehte, a Northridge assistant for the previous six seasons, accepted a 
full-time assistant position at St. Mary's College three weeks ago.

Photo, Going Through the Motions: Cal State Northridge football Coach Bob Burt 
is candid when asked about the task his team faces this season. "We've got the 
toughest schedule of any team in the conference," he says. But Burt is also 
optimistic, adding: "And we've got the talent to win every game." Burt started 
reviewing that talent Wednesday when summer camp opened, and, Saturday, the 
Matadors donned pads for the first time. The offensive unit, top, huddles 
around a coach for instructions -- and a breather -- between drills. A back 
tries to keep his balance, above, while slipping through a hole in the 
defensive line. An offensive lineman, right, takes a bead on a charging 
defender during a pass-blocking drill. CSUN will open its season Sept. 1 at 
Northern Arizona. DAVID BUTOW / for The Times

HANSEN THE FASTEST ON A SLOW NIGHT;

MOTOR SPORTS: SIMI VALLEY DRIVER SHINES IN A MAIN EVENT AT VENTURA RACEWAY AS 
PROGRAM LAGS AN HOUR BEHIND SCHEDULE.

Scott Hansen of Simi Valley drove to his second consecutive U. S. Auto Club 
Western States Series three-quarter midget win before a crowd of 3,180 to 
highlight the first Ventura County Fair "West Coast Clash" on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Hendrix of Canoga Park finished second and Cory Kruseman of Ventura was 
third in the 20-lap main event at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
The program fell nearly an hour behind schedule because of numerous delays -- 
and the fact that more than 70 cars were scheduled to compete. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier race, George Ito of Oxnard was leading the three-quarter midget 
10-lap semi-main event when his engine quit on Lap 6, allowing Jay Drake of 
Valencia to take command. The victory sent Drake into the main event, where he 
picked up enough points to hold off challenger Gary Schroeder of Burbank in the 
season points standings. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Butcher of San Leandro won the midget 12-lap semi-main, taking the lead 
for good on Lap 2 when leader Gary Howard of Anaheim hit a deep rut and spun 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Howard came from the back of the pack after the spin-out to finish second and 
gain a berth in the main event, as did Dennis Welsh of Glendale and Brian Smart 
of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Winners in the 10-lap midget heat races were Bob Davison of Santa Ana, Robby 
Flock of the City of Industry, Sleepy Tripp of Costa Mesa and Kurt Steiner of 
Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarter midget eight-lap heat-race winners were Steve Kellick of Ventura, 
Kara Hendrick of Upland, Jason Jonkman of Fountain Valley and Tom Morley of 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Three-lap trophy dash winners were Frank Pedregon of Gardena (midget) and 
Hansen (three-quarter midget). 
</P>
<P>
The final action of the weekend begins tonight at 6 with the Ventura Raceway's 
Street Stock and Mini Stock program.

BABY BORN TO SHOOTING VICTIM RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL

Keniesha Pope Harden, born earlier this month just minutes before her mother 
died from gunshot wounds suffered in a drive-by shooting, has been released 
from a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's just fine," said Deirdre Pope, the baby's aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"We will all help" rear the infant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Keniesha's mother, Kentzie Pope, died on the operating table at St. Mary 
Medical Center early Aug. 2, just 20 minutes after giving birth to her. 
</P>
<P>
Pope, 30, was the victim of a drive-by shooting that occurred late Aug. 1 in 
front of her apartment building on Elm Avenue. Police said they think that she 
was accidentally shot by gang members aiming at someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Pope -- who was eight months' pregnant -- was kept alive by what a hospital 
administrator called "aggressive resuscitation" while an emergency Cesarean was 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, in critical condition because of the premature birth, was taken to 
the hospital's neonatal intensive-care unit. She remained there until Wednesday 
afternoon, when she was released in good condition to her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Cohen, a hospital spokeswoman, said Keniesha weighed 4 pounds, 6 ounces 
upon release. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just happy that we could get some good out of what was essentially a 
tragic situation," Cohen said. "We wish we could have saved both lives." 
</P>
<P>
Family members said the infant will live in the Elm Avenue apartment with her 
aunt, grandmother, two sisters, ages 5 and 10, and an 11-year-old cousin. 
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for our faith, we wouldn't be as strong as we are," Deirdre 
Pope said. "I've had lots of nieces and nephews, so this is nothing new. We're 
doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made in the shooting.

BUSINESS IS BOOMING AT RECYCLING CENTERS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: 'A MAJOR UPSWING' IN VOLUME IS REPORTED AT RECLAMATION SITES IN 
THE AREA. CHANGES IN STATE LAW, WITTY ADVERTISING AND EARTH DAY HAVE 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE SURGE IN INTEREST.

In his 14 years in the disposal business, Ronald Ektarian has seen just about 
every kind of person pass through his chain-link gates and unload aluminum 
cans, glass bottles, plastic, newspapers and anything else they figure might be 
worth recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"We get people in everything from Rolls-Royces to Cadillacs to people who walk 
off the street," said Ektarian, a third-generation disposal man who operates Hi 
Waste Disposal Co. in Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
But sometime during the last eight months, Ektarian began seeing something new: 
greater numbers of people carting more and more recyclables -- especially glass 
and plastic beverage containers -- to his disposal company. 
</P>
<P>
That trend was evident Tuesday. Though Ektarian called the day a slow one, cars 
filed in and out of Hi Waste's yard nonstop. Fifteen minutes before closing, a 
line of about eight cars stretched out onto Arkansas Street, drivers waiting 
impatiently for the driver ahead of them to get recyclables weighed, get paid 
and get moving. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout southeast Los Angeles County, most of Ektarian's colleagues and 
competitors in the rapidly expanding recycling industry said they have seen a 
similar boom in business -- a phenomenon underscored by newly released state 
Department of Conservation statistics. Statewide, the agency reports a 50% 
increase in the volume of glass, plastic and aluminum beverage containers 
recycled the first six months of this year, in contrast with the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have definitely seen a major upswing in volume," said Ron Schweitzer, the 
president of Mobile Recycling Co., which operates centers throughout Southern 
California, including 11 in southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
At his company's southeast centers, Schweitzer said, the volume of glass and 
plastic beverage containers has tripled since January, and the volume of 
aluminum cans being recycled has climbed steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer's company also accepts newspapers, tin cans, milk jugs and paper and 
plastic grocery bags. He reported that the volume of each of these items has 
also increased significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"Every month, we are doing more (business) than we've ever done before," added 
Richard Graff, assistant general manager of ENVIPCO California Inc., a 
corporation that owns about 40 vending machines that allow customers to deposit 
aluminum, plastic and glass beverage containers in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
He said that from January to July, the volume of aluminum being recycled at the 
reverse vending machines in the Southeast increased by 3 1/2 times, and the 
volume of plastic beverage containers soared fivefold. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Johnson, vice president for government affairs for the 20/20 Recycle 
Center, which owns seven Southeast centers, said his company has also noted a 
surge since the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer, Graff, Johnson and other industry experts attribute the recycling 
spurt to a confluence of factors: 
</P>
<P>
* A change in state law that in January raised the payoff on recycled beverage 
containers from 1 cent per container to two containers for a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
* Greater environmental awareness, stemming in large part from the extensive 
media attention given to Earth Day earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Witty TV ad campaigns paid for by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said the increase in state payments for beverage containers 
has brought out more people who recycle primarily for economic reasons. And it 
has made the practice more profitable for such people as Robert Tiscareno, who 
has been recycling for years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is money out there if you look for it," said Tiscareno, 69, a retired 
meat cutter who keeps a tattered record of his recycling transactions and 
estimates that he has made $5,000 in the last six years through recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I went out and found some water faucets, brought them back here and 
took home $28. I wasn't even out 10 minutes, and I came back and made money." 
the Norwalk resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson, 21, a Cerritos resident, said every day after he gets off work 
at a nearby Carl's Jr., he drives through neighborhoods and around parks, 
hunting for recyclable materials. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said he takes his finds to Ektarian just about every day, and on a good 
day he can take home $30. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little extra money," Simpson said. "It helps pay the bills." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the growing number of people who recycle for economic reasons, the 
focus on Earth Day this year -- together with all the negative publicity 
surrounding oil spills, air pollution, rapidly filling landfills and 
contaminated water -- has spurred more people to recycle for ecological 
reasons, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, Cal State Long Beach has operated a recycling center that does 
not pay its patrons. Those who want to recycle simply drive up a ramp and 
unload newspaper, glass, plastic, tin and cardboard into huge garbage bins. 
Staff members said every year business gets better, but during the last year 
things really picked up. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be open 24 hours a day, but we just couldn't deal with it," staff 
member Lauren Goskirk said. "We couldn't get the stuff out fast enough, it was 
piled on the ramp." 
</P>
<P>
Goskirk said the staff had to scale back hours, much to the ire of customers 
who now find that, particularly on Saturdays, they have to wait in line to drop 
off their materials. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the flow of cars was steady and, as people unloaded their trunks, 
many said that they were new to recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, to me it's a bother," said Lakewood resident Lloyd Hughes, who has 
been recycling for about a year. "But if it helps a little bit, why, I guess 
I'll keep on doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Kerasotes, 23, a Bellflower resident who lives with her mother, said they 
both started recycling after the April 22 Earth Day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"We both watched this special on TV on Earth Day, and it really affected us," 
she said. "It's really scary how we are running out of space in the landfills, 
and recycling is so easy to do. Just saving your newspapers or cans." 
</P>
<P>
20/20 vice president Johnson said that in addition to those who recycle for 
economic reasons and those who recycle for ecological reasons, another group of 
recyclers is growing fast: the typical consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken a while for the public to become aware of what this is all about, 
but the average household person is starting to become aware of recycling and 
redemption centers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said they expect even more people to begin recycling as cities 
throughout California begin complying with a tough new state law requiring that 
each municipality cut by half the amount of garbage going to landfills by the 
year 2000. Many area cities are expected to start curbside recycling programs 
along with campaigns to encourage residents to use less and recycle more. 
</P>
<P>
However, the recycling surge isn't making everyone happy. Scrap dealers, 
disposal company owners and city officials are grumbling that by passing the 
state law expected to lead to extensive curbside recycling, legislators have 
created a market for which there is no demand. 
</P>
<P>
Already, most recycling centers are awash in newspapers and are finding that 
the market for them is glutted. At one time, newspapers could not be recycled 
fast enough; now industry experts said they have a hard time finding someone 
who will buy them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more business, but because of the marketplace there is less profit to 
be made," rubbish man Ektarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Southeast cities, who recently banded together to share costs on a 
study that will help them meet the demands of the new law, said the Legislature 
has to encourage, perhaps even force, business to use recycled goods. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lamond, a Long Beach resident and member of the city's advisory committee 
on solid waste and recycling, said that although beverage containers are a 
relatively small part of the waste stream, the interest in recycling is 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start. . . . As long as we keep reminding people, keep this issue on 
the forefront, recycling is bound to increase," he said.

WRECKERS STIR UP AS MANY MEMORIES AS DUST AT FORD PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the Ford Motor Co., it was the world's most modern and efficient factory of 
1930, churning out one Model A every 93 minutes. To the city, it was a ticket 
to modern industrialization. And to some of the men who worked on its grinding 
assembly line, it was "a real sweatshop." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a quarter of a century, the old brick plant at the edge of the 
Port of Long Beach buzzed with the mechanical genius of Henry Ford and helped 
turn a virtuous beach resort into an industrial boom town. 
</P>
<P>
Now the plant is coming down. Although it has been nothing but an oversize 
warehouse since Ford moved out in 1959, the poking and prodding of workmen 
preparing it for demolition are stirring up as many memories -- good and bad -- 
as they are dust. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fascinating building, a building that represented the coming of age 
of Long Beach as a modern city," said Ruthann Lehrer, neighborhood and historic 
preservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
"By today's standards, it was a sweatshop," countered Don Thomas, who worked on 
the upholstery end of the line in 1945 and was glad to leave it one year later. 
"They would complain if someone went to the bathroom on company time. The Ford 
Motor Co. (plant) was not an easy place to work." 
</P>
<P>
Up to 2,000 men once worked under the hot lamps of the line, but today the huge 
factory stands hollow and vacant, except for a few homeless people who sleep 
there at night and an occasional pair of pigeons nesting in its rafters. 
</P>
<P>
The sheer history of the place has qualified it for the National Register of 
Historic Places. Ford handpicked the site to manufacture the classic Model A, 
the car that helped turn a rich man's luxury into a poor man's staple. 
</P>
<P>
But history has been bumped aside by progress. The Ford plant is an earthquake 
hazard, full of asbestos. And it's standing in the way of the expansion of a 
port that is one of the largest in the country and growing fast. 
</P>
<P>
When port administrators announced recently that they would knock the building 
down to use the valuable land along Cerritos Channel for container storage, 
scarcely a word of protest was heard, even from usually vocal Long Beach 
preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
There was some talk of turning it into a nautical museum or a restaurant for 
passing cruise ships, but the cost was considered prohibitive and the location 
-- on the fringe of a gray industrial section of town -- too remote. 
</P>
<P>
By December, demolition experts say, it will be rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fascinating building," Lehrer said, "one that means a great deal 
historically to the city. But from a practical standpoint, there's really no 
use for it anymore. I am always sorry to see a building of such overwhelming 
historical importance that has no future." 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for the demolition, port administrators say, they have spent 
close to $100,000 to make a detailed photographic and historical record for 
remembering the plant. 
</P>
<P>
A report already compiled by researchers -- who deemed the factory eligible for 
national landmark status -- tells the following story of a town and a factory 
that helped share a few years of industrial glory. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Motor Co. was young and booming in Michigan by the 1920s, and 2,000 
miles west, so was Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While Ford was pioneering an assembly line that spit out one Model T every 93 
minutes, Long Beach was striking oil. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Roaring '20s were over, there were 15 million Model Ts on the road 
-- more than half of all the automobiles sold in the world. At the same time, 
the Pacific Fleet had come to Long Beach, creating a strong and growing harbor 
and positioning the city to attract nationally known manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The first of them would be Henry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
It was Christmas of 1927 when Ford decided to replace the fabulously successful 
Model T with the Model A, a modern wonder with roll-down windows that started 
without a crank. It would be built, Ford decreed, in a customized factory, his 
36th in the country, at Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors were swirling in Long Beach over the arrival of Ford, by then a living 
American legend. "The key to Long Beach is yours," the mayor and several other 
city officials proclaimed in a full-page Press-Telegram newspaper ad. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market crashed in the fall of 1929, but who cared? Ford was promising 
to employ 1,200 men. He had nearly doubled the minimum wage of the day to $5 
and cut the workday from nine hours to eight. 
</P>
<P>
On April 21, 1930, Lt. Gov. H.S. Carnahan pressed a button at the Pacific Coast 
Club (another landmark that would not survive the century) and an assembly line 
1 1/2 football fields long began to roll at 106 inches a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's 29-year relationship with Long Beach would be as rocky as a torrid love 
affair, beset by labor problems, a world war, even an earthquake, then lifted 
to record heights by the prosperous postwar '50s. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million factory more than kept its promise, employing 2,000 men rather 
than 1,200. It produced 300 cars a day and supplied Model As to 200 Ford 
dealers on the Pacific Coast. Business Week magazine on April 16, 1930, lauded 
the new plant as "one more step in the amazing transformation of Southern 
California from a tourist's paradise into an important industrial community." 
</P>
<P>
The plant surged with initial success until the Depression took hold and cars 
stopped selling. The success of the Model A, which the Long Beach factory had 
been designed to produce, was "solid but not spectacular," mostly because Ford 
refused to offer such innovative features as a V-8 engine. 
</P>
<P>
"Ford's stubbornness cost him leadership in the industry as the Model A was 
outsold by General Motors' Chevrolet and Chrysler's Plymouth," researchers 
later concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The last Model A left the line in 1931. Shortly afterward, Ford cut the minimum 
wage to $4 a day, below prevailing industry pay levels. 
</P>
<P>
More trouble was to come at 5:56 p.m. on March 10, 1933, when a 6.3-intensity 
tremor struck with an epicenter in Huntington Beach. In 10 seconds, what is 
known to history as the Long Beach earthquake killed up to 52 people and left 
behind $45 million in property damage in Long Beach. Martial law was declared, 
and soldiers patrolled the harbor with bayonets. The damaged Ford plant shut 
down and did not reopen until December, 1934 -- with many new problems on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Labor unions were demanding decent working conditions and a livable wage. The 
Long Beach plant was plagued by strikes. And men like Thomas, the former 
assembly line worker, left in search of steadier work. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry Ford paid $5 way back when, but he also got the most out of people 
before he gave them that $5," said Thomas, who recently took city officials on 
a tour of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
When the speed of the line got comfortable, operators were told to crank it up, 
Thomas said. Most young GIs working on the line could not afford to buy one of 
the cars they helped produce, which sold then for about $550. (But any worker 
who could accumulate enough money for a car was given the day off to follow it 
through the line and make sure it was manufactured just right.) 
</P>
<P>
Then came World War II, and the federal government leased the plant to be used 
as an army supply depot. Two-door sedans gave way to jeeps. Ford moved its 
offices to Los Angeles, and its auto-making to Richmond in Contra Costa County. 
</P>
<P>
When the war ended on Aug. 15, 1945, Ford rose like a phoenix in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Within four years, the Long Beach plant was producing 50,000 cars a year and 
boasting of modernized spray-paint booths that, Ford said, were so well 
ventilated that workmen didn't need respirators. Production hit its peak in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, profits soared. But something else was sinking: Long Beach 
Harbor. Oil dredging was causing the bottom to collapse. The Edison plant at 
the center of the harbor had sunk 22 feet and was dropping two feet a year. The 
Ford plant was well below sea level. The Navy was threatening to leave. 
</P>
<P>
By 1958, the city was injecting water below the harbor's surface and the 
problem that had threatened to wipe out Long Beach's economy was solved. But by 
then, Ford had decided to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The plant shut down March 20, 1959, and Ford moved to Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
The factory that Henry Ford had called his pride and joy was relegated to a 
warehouse that slowly faded from the public memory. 
</P>
<P>
"This plant embodies much of what Henry Ford stood for and preserves for the 
community a sense of time associated with his genius," researchers wrote in a 
May report assessing the building's eligibility for national landmark status. 
</P>
<P>
But the factory that had helped change the city is the city's latest victim of 
change. The port once known for manufacturing now profits wildly from import 
and storage of products manufactured somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"The older structures are coming down. Unfortunately, that happens," said 
Stacey Crouch, environmental specialist at the port. "It would be nice to save 
them all, but they aren't all safe. And in order to be the least 
environmentally damaging, we have to develop on property that already exists. 
That's our problem." 
</P>
<P>
The port will make way for a cargo handling terminal. Ironically, there is some 
chance that

NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE;

<P>
DOCTORS GAVE NICOLE, 2, SIX MONTHS TO LIVE. NOW 4, SHE HAS DEFIED THE ODDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nicole Anguiano wasn't expected to last long -- what with the diabetes, a 
suspected stroke and, most of all, an inoperable, fast-growing brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
The unrelenting advance of her affliction seemed particularly out of place in a 
2-year-old with beautiful brown hair and sparkling, mischievous eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Her prognosis in 1988: six months to live, maybe a little more, maybe less. 
</P>
<P>
But she is still here, vital and seemingly normal. Nothing about her suggests 
decline and death. At her fourth birthday party Aug. 12 in Whittier's Central 
Park, she collected her Bart Simpson doll, Woody Woodpecker bag and Mickey 
Mouse backpack with every intention of enjoying the presents. 
</P>
<P>
Her neurologist, Dr. Warren Cohen, won't classify Nicole's survival a medical 
miracle. That would be premature. But her rebound was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very unusual," he said. "It's not that she's unique. There are 
other children like her. For some reason, the growth of the tumor plateaus off. 
For some reason, it doesn't grow any more." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rest of Nicole grows just fine, and the outlook appears far 
different from November, 1988, when more than a dozen doctors at Childrens 
Hospital Los Angeles clustered around the family and Nicole. The physicians 
conducted test after test and asked questions: Had she fallen? Had she hit her 
head? Had she had any kind of traumatic experience? 
</P>
<P>
The Anguianos had brought Nicole for treatment because her eyes turned to the 
right one morning and more or less stayed there. And she would start to gag 
when she saw other people eating. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of doctors' referrals, Nicole's grandparents, mother and uncle 
piled into their 1979 Buick Regal for the journey downtown. "We had thought 
that the worst thing possible was that she would need glasses," recalled 
Anna-Maria Anguiano, Nicole's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Nicole became one of less than 2,000 U.S. children younger than 15 who 
each year develop tumors in their nervous systems. In her case, the tumor was 
in the brain stem. Surgery was out of the question: Even if Nicole had left the 
operating table alive, a remote possibility, the brush of a surgical instrument 
against a nerve could disable her forever. 
</P>
<P>
"You would literally have to kill her to remove it," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Radiation and chemotherapy treatments were options, but doctors said they would 
prolong Nicole's life by a matter of months at best -- an extension accompanied 
by side effects such as hair loss, nausea, skin problems and nervous system and 
developmental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
"We all sat down and decided that whatever time God gives her, we want it to be 
quality time," her grandmother says. "The doctors did not try to persuade us to 
change our minds." 
</P>
<P>
So the Anguianos chose steroid therapy in a bid to reduce the tumor's swelling. 
And they waited. 
</P>
<P>
Events unfolded just as forecast. Nicole declined. She lost her ability to 
walk, returned to diapers, gained weight because of the medication and grew 
listless. 
</P>
<P>
In what promised to be a last wish come true in early February, 1989, Nicole -- 
now in a wheelchair -- was rolled into the dressing room of her hero, the 
wrestler Hulk Hogan, who gave her royal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Nicole slipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months had passed since the original diagnoses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mad," said Dolores Anguiano, Nicole's mother, remembering that doctors 
had predicted that Nicole would live longer. 
</P>
<P>
"They had said six months, and I wanted my six months with her," said Anguiano, 
24, who is enrolled in a nurse's training program. 
</P>
<P>
When doctors could offer no hope, the family was willing to disconnect life 
support but elected to wait until Nicole's Uncle Carlos could rush back from 
military service in Germany. He wanted to say goodby to Nicole, but the Army 
"didn't want to give me emergency leave at first because a niece isn't 
immediate family," Carlos Anguiano Jr. said. "They didn't realize. . . . We're 
all we got." 
</P>
<P>
Three generations of the tightly knit family live in a two-bedroom house on 
Hadley Street in Whittier. Nicole's Uncle David, now 17, stepped in to become 
almost a father to his niece when his sister's marriage plans fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
While the family waited for Carlos to cut through the Army's red tape, Nicole 
lingered in a coma on life support for five days. 
</P>
<P>
Around her hospital bed, the family read Nicole her favorite stories and 
touched her so she might know they were there. No response. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nicole twitched. The family called a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The nurse told them it was nothing, probably an involuntary movement. Later, 
the nurse saw another twitch and wasn't so sure any more what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Nicole began to emerge from the coma. Doctors warned the family that 
she might be mentally impaired, she might not know them, she might quickly 
relapse into a coma and not come out again. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know who's talking to you," her grandmother asked Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
The child mouthed, "Grandma." She couldn't speak the word because there was so 
much tubing in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos arrived home two days later and said hello rather than goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Although she had regained consciousness, the tumor continued to grow. At one 
point last year, it was 50% larger than when it was first spotted. It would 
have killed Nicole had it not mysteriously stopped swelling nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since emerging from her coma, Nicole has relearned how to crawl, then to walk. 
Finally, she started running and hasn't slowed down much since -- despite 
having to recover from a possible stroke she suffered while in the coma and 
despite having to take medication to treat a form of diabetes that may be tied 
to the tumor. 
</P>
<P>
She has also suffered two minor seizures, including one the morning of last 
weekend's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes were closing and they took me to the hospital," Nicole said while 
sitting on a park swing at her party. "But I got better, and they didn't have 
to give me a blood test." 
</P>
<P>
A pigeon-toed, devilishly charming cherub in denim shorts with a bright blue 
ribbon in her hair, Nicole glanced at the handful of listeners who had gathered 
around. She said in a tone more playful than the words would indicate: "Now, I 
want to swing on my swing, so just get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
"She's rewriting history," her grandmother said. "She'd gone into a coma, and 
the doctors said she wasn't going to come out, and if she did, she'd be a 
vegetable. But now she runs around and laughs and remembers everything." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Cohen stressed that the history Nicole is rewriting is strictly her own, 
and he worries that her case could give rise to false hope among parents of 
terminally ill children. He and the family also realize that the tumor has only 
gone to sleep, not gone away. 
</P>
<P>
As her grandmother noted, "She could outlive us all, or tomorrow could be a 
black day." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "I just want people to know you can be happy when life deals you 
something like this. Nicole's what keeps us going. We live as normal a life as 
we can."

Those in the mood for another kind of festival could head over to the Hsi Lai 
Temple in Hacienda Heights, which on Saturday is presenting its annual 
celebration of Sangha, a Buddhist holiday honoring monks and nuns. 
</P>
<P>
Temple members will cook a feast to honor the monastics. 
</P>
<P>
The meal brings good luck to the food preparers and onlookers, but only the 
monks and nuns get to eat. Sangha, one of the most important days of the year 
in the Buddhist faith, is considered auspicious because it falls on the 15th 
day of the seventh month, according to the lunar calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Hsi Lai Temple members and the public are encouraged to bring contributions of 
rice and vegetables and to help prepare the vegetarian meal. 
</P>
<P>
Participants must arrive by 10 a.m. A chanting ceremony will be held at 10:30 
a.m., with the meal served to monks and nuns at 11 a.m. During the feast, 
temple members will perform Buddhist and Chinese folk songs and dances. 
</P>
<P>
The free festival will take place at the temple, at 3456 S. Glenmark Drive in 
Hacienda Heights. For more information, call (818) 961-9697. MARY ANN SWISSLER

PEOPLE: FOR 2 NEW TEACHERS, IT'S LIKE COMING HOME AGAIN AS THEY TAKE INNER CITY

Recent college graduates Ray Owens and Ileetha Brooks will start their teaching 
careers in familiar surroundings when school opens next month and they welcome 
youngsters to elementary school classes in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
Owens and Brooks are among 500 participants in the Teach for America project, 
aimed at alleviating teacher shortages in cities and rural areas. The project, 
begun by a 1989 Princeton graduate, Wendy Kopp, is modeled after the Peace 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
For Owens and Brooks, it will be like going home again. "I was born in Compton 
but moved to Austin as an 8-year-old," said Owens, 29. "I used to swim in 
Lynwood." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks grew up in the Watts-Compton area. "I am simply going to the community I 
grew up in to teach the people there," Brooks said. "My mother is there. She 
will always be there." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, a graduate of UC Berkeley, is one of about 35 recruits expected to join 
the Compton Unified School District. Owens, a University of Texas graduate, is 
one of 39 recruits scheduled to teach in the Lynwood Unified School District. 
About 225 of the 500 participants will work in the Los Angeles, Compton, 
Lynwood, Inglewood and Pasadena school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Owens and Brooks completed eight weeks of intensive teacher training at USC and 
taught this summer in the Los Angeles district. They and other recruits are 
committed to teach at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who has a bachelor's degree in psychology, said she plans to get a 
doctorate in educational psychology, with an emphasis on the black family. Her 
goal is to become a professor and do research in educational psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Owens majored in economics and government and originally envisioned a business 
career. He left college to work as an enforcement officer in the state 
controller's office in Texas, but returned to school to get a bachelor's degree 
in English after deciding that he did not like the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized I always wanted to be a teacher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he might someday be interested in switching from teaching to writing 
curricula. 
</P>
<P>
Owens gave the commencement speech during graduation ceremonies for recruits 
Wednesday at USC. He urged his colleagues to be sensitive to the needs of 
students and to help them succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"I challenge you to care," he said. "There is a little girl in Baton Rouge who 
needs to know you care. There is a little boy in Compton that needs to know 
that you believe in him." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Harrison was addicted to drugs and alcohol when she decided to mend her 
life several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After undergoing treatment for her addiction, the mother of two teen-age 
children went to night school to get her high school diploma. She graduated 
from Dominguez High School along with her daughter, Meeka. They enrolled 
together at Compton College. Meeka Harrison took time off to care for her 
infant son; Debra Harrison graduated in June. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, 38, will continue to take early-childhood courses at the college and 
plans to open a day-care center in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Around the campus, Harrison is well known for her boosterism. She has organized 
pep rallies, raised funds for student events and been on the student council. 
Harrison, who rarely misses an athletic event, is commissioner of athletics on 
the student council. 
</P>
<P>
"She's everyone's mom," said Mark Haynes, student body president. "She loves to 
have someone to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes created a special award -- Associated Student Body President's Award -- 
for Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Flores has been appointed as the new program director of the Flossie 
Lewis Center, a Long Beach recovery home for women troubled by alcoholism and 
drug dependence. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, a recovering alcoholic, has helped start a couple of homes for 
recovering women, including establishing a sober-living housing project in San 
Pedro. The Flossie Lewis Center also includes a program for homeless women 
recovering from drug dependence.

PASADENA LOSES 10TH OFFICIAL;

ADMINISTRATORS: THE RESIGNATIONS HAVE COME IN A CLUSTER SINCE THE FORMER CITY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's director of public works and transportation is joining the parade of 
administrators who have departed from City Hall in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 3, Tom Wood becomes the 10th administrator to leave since former City 
Manager Donald McIntyre announced last year that he would retire July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, director of public works and transportation for the last two years, will 
become deputy city manager of Anaheim. He said his job change had nothing to do 
with McIntyre's departure or with the arrival of City Manager Philip Hawkey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unbelievable opportunity, a real challenge to work in the position 
I've been offered," said Wood, 38, a resident of Huntington Beach. "My 
objective is to become a city manager someday. This was a chance that I really 
couldn't turn down, as difficult as it is to leave a place like this." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had been recruited by Anaheim. "Unfortunately, there are not too 
many positions like that in Southern California," he said. "When they become 
available, you've got to go for them." 
</P>
<P>
Wood's annual salary will increase in Anaheim, from $85,800 to $98,000. 
</P>
<P>
While working for Pasadena, Wood helped to create, among other things, a 
recycling program, a citywide tree-planting project, and a program to encourage 
the use of car pools and mass transit by city employees. 
</P>
<P>
"He has made many significant contributions to the city, and we'll miss his 
talents," Hawkey said. 
</P>

CONVENTION PROMOTERS URGED TO HELP FILL OFFICE BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN DOHERTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The organization that uses city money to promote the convention center and 
hotels has been urged by the city auditor to take on an added job: luring 
permanent businesses to vacant downtown offices. 
</P>
<P>
Auditor Robert Fronke said the Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors Council 
receives enough public money "that they can take on another goal." 
</P>
<P>
Fronke said he recommended the added duties because the organization "has been 
so successful and aggressive with covering the convention business." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said money generated by tourists and convention delegates in Long 
Beach has jumped from $60 million in 1983, the group's first operating year, to 
more than $340 million in 1988. While most of the money goes to private hotel 
and restaurant operators, much of it ends up in city coffers as taxes and other 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
The organization this year has received more than $2.5 million from the city, a 
62% increase since 1987. The money is from the bed tax -- a levy placed on 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed expansion of duties was one of several recommendations in the 
audit, which was submitted last week to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But group and city officials criticized the proposed expansion of duties. 
"That's off the wall," said D. Christopher Davis, president of the convention 
and visitors council. 
</P>
<P>
The organization does not have the resources, he said, to take on the added 
assignment of trying to coax businesses to move downtown, where the office 
vacancy rate is 18.6%. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Evan Anderson Braude sided with Davis. "We're expanding the 
convention center, and we need all the help we can get in that area," said 
Braude, whose council district includes the center. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James Hankla told the City Council that other organizations -- 
such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Redevelopment Agency -- are already 
working on attracting business downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have too many cooks stirring the pot," Hankla warned. 
</P>
<P>
The audit also recommended that the organization's 24-member board of directors 
be expanded to include a broader mix of business representatives. The group's 
bylaws require that two-thirds of its 24 directors be from the hotel industry. 
A more diversified board would prevent the group from becoming too 
"self-serving," Fronke said. 
</P>
<P>
The audit suggested that local colleges, transportation and the defense 
industry could also have representatives on the board. "It's bound to add some 
dimension to their planning process," Fronke said. 
</P>
<P>
Organization officials said in response to the audit that they would consider 
expanding the board. 
</P>
<P>
Members concede that the transience of hotel officials can hamper such an 
organization. "It's always a problem the way hotel people move around," said 
Sam King, a member of the board who is the co-owner of several area 
restaurants, including the Pine Avenue Fish House. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors also recommended that the council tighten accounting policies and 
control of its cash. Fronke said he found no evidence that the council misused 
public money, but he said the "potential" is there if changes are not made. 
</P>
<P>
The audit criticized the practice of having one person receive payments and 
sign checks and said some expenses were being recorded in the wrong budget 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said the organization had paid $33,000 in bonuses without 
authorization of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The group is adding an employee to handle accounting, but officials questioned 
the comment about bonuses, saying there are clear criteria for awarding 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors council was formed in 1982, four years after a similar group, the 
Promotion and Services Corp., dissolved because of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
City officials praised the council's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has a whole new thriving industry as a result" of this council, said 
John Williams, deputy city manager, who oversees the city's contract with the 
visitors council. 
</P>
<P>
Williams wrote the organization's response to the audit.

CARD CLUB INITIATIVE TO BE PUT ON WEST HOLLYWOOD'S NOVEMBER BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Hollywood City Council has placed a gambling initiative on the 
November ballot, asking voters to decide whether the city should allow one 
legalized card club to operate within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which has been unanimous in its opposition to the measure, voted 3 
to 1 recently to hold the referendum anyway -- betting that the city's best 
chance to defeat the gambling initiative would come during the November general 
election, when more voters go to the polls than in other elections. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also predicted that the measure would have a hard time passing, 
saying it sets up a "special tax" and therefore requires a two-thirds vote for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the November referendum was welcome news to backers of the 
initiative, who had tried and failed to gather enough signatures in time to 
place an initiative on the November ballot. But they did collect more than 
enough to qualify a measure for the next municipal election in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted by the news, and we are ready to get started," proclaimed 
Philip Marks, a general partner of the Cavendish West Hollywood, a private 
bridge and rummy club that is sponsoring the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
City officials agreed to hold the election in November after proponents of the 
initiative said they did not want to wait until 1992 to hold a referendum and 
announced plans to launch another petition drive to get a measure on the ballot 
in April, 1991, when the community college election is expected to draw few 
voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be an election we could lose because most people don't show up," 
said Councilman Paul Koretz as he joined Abbe Land and Babette Lang in voting 
for the November initiative. Sal Guarriello cast the only vote against the 
measure. John Heilman was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The card club would be similar to clubs operating in the cities of Commerce and 
Bell Gardens, where legal card games such as draw poker are allowed but games 
of chance such as blackjack are prohibited. The clubs make their profit by 
renting table space to the players. Betting against the house is not permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the initiative claim that the city could get from $5 million to 
$10 million annually from the club, roughly 10% of its estimated gross 
revenues.

BEING ALIVE -- NICOLE'S MIRACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicole Anguiano of Whittier wasn't expected to last long -- what with the 
diabetes, a suspected stroke and, most of all, an inoperable, fast-growing 
brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
The unrelenting advance of her affliction seemed particularly out of place in a 
2-year-old with beautiful brown hair and sparkling, mischievous eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Her prognosis in 1988: six months to live, maybe a little more, maybe less. 
</P>
<P>
But she is still here, vital and seemingly normal. 
</P>
<P>
Her neurologist, Dr. Warren Cohen, won't classify Nicole's survival a medical 
miracle. That would be premature. But her rebound was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very unusual," he said. "It's not that she's unique. There are 
other children like her. For some reason, the growth of the tumor plateaus off. 
For some reason, it doesn't grow any more." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rest of Nicole grows just fine, and the outlook appears far 
different from November, 1988, when more than a dozen doctors at Childrens 
Hospital Los Angeles clustered around the family and Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
The Anguianos had brought Nicole for treatment because her eyes turned to the 
right one morning and more or less stayed there. And she would start to gag 
when she saw other people eating. 
</P>
<P>
"We had thought that the worst thing possible was that she would need glasses," 
recalled Anna-Maria Anguiano, Nicole's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole had a tumor on her brain stem. Surgery was out of the question: Even if 
Nicole had left the operating table alive, a remote possibility, the brush of a 
surgical instrument against a nerve could disable her forever. 
</P>
<P>
"You would literally have to kill her to remove it," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Radiation and chemotherapy treatments were options, but doctors said they would 
prolong Nicole's life by a matter of months at best. 
</P>
<P>
The Anguianos chose steroid therapy in a bid to reduce the tumor's swelling. 
And they waited. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole declined. She lost her ability to walk, returned to diapers, gained 
weight because of the medication and grew listless. 
</P>
<P>
In early February, Nicole slipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months had passed since the original diagnoses. 
</P>
<P>
When doctors could offer no hope, the family was willing to disconnect life 
support but chose to wait until Nicole's Uncle Carlos could rush back from 
Germany. He wanted to say goodby to Nicole, but the Army wouldn't give him 
emergency leave at first. 
</P>
<P>
While the family waited for Carlos, Nicole lingered in a coma on life support 
for five days. 
</P>
<P>
The family read Nicole her favorite stories and touched her so she might know 
they were there. No response. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nicole twitched. The family called a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The nurse told them it was nothing, probably an involuntary movement. Later, 
the nurse saw another twitch and wasn't so sure anymore what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Nicole began to emerge from the coma. Doctors warned the family that 
she might be mentally impaired, she might not know them, she might quickly 
relapse into a coma and not come out again. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know who's talking to you," her grandmother asked. 
</P>
<P>
The child mouthed, "Grandma." She couldn't speak the word because there was so 
much tubing in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Although she had regained consciousness, the tumor continued to grow. At one 
point last year, it was 50% larger than when it was first spotted. It would 
have killed Nicole had it not mysteriously stopped swelling nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since emerging from her coma, Nicole has relearned how to crawl, then to walk. 
Finally, she started running and hasn't slowed down much since -- despite 
having to recover from a possible stroke she suffered while in the coma and 
despite having to take medication to treat a form of diabetes that may be tied 
to the tumor. 
</P>
<P>
She has also suffered two minor seizures, including one the morning of her 
fourth birthday party last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"She's rewriting history," her grandmother said. "She'd gone into a coma, and 
the doctors said she wasn't going to come out, and if she did, she'd be a 
vegetable. But now she runs around and laughs and remembers everything." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen stresses that the history Nicole is rewriting is strictly her own, and 
worries that Nicole's case could give rise to false hope among parents of 
terminally ill children. He and the family also realize that the tumor has not 
gone away.

SAMPLING THE VINTAGE WINES OF NORTHERN ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FREES, Frees is a free-lance writer living in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>

<P>
ALBA, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One need not be a diehard wine drinker to have heard that the '8Os was a good 
decade for Italian winemakers. Their wines have brought home gold medals from 
international wine fairs, praise from wine writers and ever-higher revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the best Italian winemakers are known around the world, even in 
such countries as Japan, where wine is a fairly recent discovery. Today, many 
travelers come to Italy to taste the wines at the point of production, where 
all wines seem to show their best features. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Italy's wine tourism infrastructure is largely undeveloped. 
There is hardly anything on the level of France, California or even Australia. 
Italian wineries are usually too small. They lack tasting rooms for visitors. 
They lack the multilingual personnel for tours of their vineyards. Most 
crucial, they lack the volume of wine to pour a glass for everyone who comes 
by. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the peregrinating wine drinker shouldn't abandon the idea of an Italian 
wine degustazione in the mother country. It's just that dropping in on wineries 
isn't the best method of operation. It's much better to visit enotecas (wine 
shops with tasting bars) and restaurants with a special focus on wine. These 
places have done the ground work, traveled the country roads and collected the 
stars of Italy's evolving winemaking industry. 
</P>
<P>
Piedmont stakes a claim as Italy's premier red wine region. Only Tuscany can 
offer a credible challenge. Piedmont has two red powerhouses: Barolo and 
Barbaresco. Each can go glass-to-glass with any wine in the world. The wines 
are made in two neighboring zones that encircle the town of Alba, which is 
known for its tartufi bianchi (white truffles). 
</P>
<P>
Life around these parts is quiet, and the business of tourism is small in 
scope. In fact, during the October truffle fair, when foreigners come in 
volume, visitor accommodations are totally overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the crowds, this is the best time to visit, for not only are there 
truffles galore, but porcini mushrooms, wild game and the wine harvest. 
Unfortunately, all the commotion is an annoyance for the winemakers right in 
the middle of their most serious work of the year. 
</P>
<P>
This problem is solved beautifully by the country albergos (restaurant/inns). 
Amost every village in the region has such a place where a range of wines can 
be tasted and purchased. They are handy places to stay, literally in the 
vineyards, and are reliable purveyors of the massive and idiosyncratic 
Piedmontese cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
If La Contesa in Neive d'Alba is the place to sample Barbarescos, Barolo 
addicts make their pilgrimages to the Giardino da Felicin in Monforte d'Alba, 
about 18 miles southwest of Neive. 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio Rocca runs this restaurant/lodge with great humor. He can usually be 
found joking with guests in four languages, jumping from one language to 
another on alternating sentences. At any given time, he has 75 different 
Barolos in the cellar. His son Nino has taken over as cellar master and 
monitors the wines' development. 
</P>
<P>
He recommended a remarkable 1982 Barolo from Fontanafredda's Lazzarito vineyard 
on our last visit. During the truffle fair last fall, 300 people came one day 
asking for lunch. Only 40 could be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
In Alba, there is a restaurant that has a brilliant selection of wines from all 
over Italy -- the Osteria dell'Arco. They pour the rare Faccianelo and 
Sassicaia from Tuscany. A must-try is the Bricco de'Ucceone Barbera from 
Giacomo Bologna, whose winery is east of Asti and murderously hard to find on 
your own. It's one of Italy's finest red wines. The food, unfortunately, is not 
as grand as the wine. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to concentrate on the fascinations of Milan and can't make the more 
than two-hour drive to Piedmont, many of the wines can be tasted and purchased 
in the city. Try Enoteca Ronchi. It has a broad selection of Piedmontese wines, 
plus others from all over Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The owner was Italy's first woman sommelier. She has the rare Torcolato from 
Maculan and Recioto di Soave from Roberto Anselmi, two of Italy's best dessert 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Iseo is one of the least compromised of Italy's northern lakes. Near its 
southern shores is the Franciacorta wine zone. This zone has made its name with 
champagne, in Italian spumante (don't confuse with the syrupy Asti Spumante). 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorite wine bar/restaurants is in the town of Iseo. It's called Il 
Volto and it's run by a couple of self-proclaimed wine enthusiasts, Vittorio 
Fusari and Roberto Sgarbi. At the bar you can usually select from about 20 
wines by the glass. Go with the spumantes. Highly recommended are Ca del 
Bosco's cremant or Bellavista's gran cuvee. 
</P>
<P>
By the bottle, Italy's best is waiting. At Il Volto, our last stop in Iseo, we 
drank a Trebbiano from Edoardo Valentini that could rival a good white 
burgundy. The food is excellent, and the mood is relaxed and convivial. 
</P>
<P>
No, Tuscany will not concede Italian red wine superiority to Piedmont. The 
Tuscans are most famous for chianti, of course. But chianti is not their top 
hitter. That distinction goes to Brunello, followed by Carmignano and Vino 
Nobile di Montepuciano. There are also a growing number of blended Cabernet 
Sauvignons that are displaying excellent form. And there is even a nice Tuscan 
white wine, San Gimignano. 
</P>
<P>
In almost every cafe and trattoria, you can taste a half-dozen of the 
neighborhood wines by the glass. And there are several wineries geared toward 
wine tourism: Badia a Coltibuono in the Chianti zone and Fattoria Barbi in the 
Brunello zone. There are also several remarkable restaurants that focus on wine 
and the robust Tuscan cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
For those in search of the elusive and costly Brunello, a must-stop is La 
Cucina di Edgardo in the center of the Brunello zone at Montalcino. The owner, 
Edgardo Sandolini, attempts to have at least one bottle from each of the 
approximately hundred Brunello makers -- only from good vintages of course. 
</P>
<P>
He has a menu where each of the four courses is matched with a wine. His wild 
boar is great with Brunello. Brunellos not to miss are Costanti's and 
Cerbaiona's, both rarely seen outside of the area. Signor Sandolini has a 
sister restaurant in Milan, Il Montalcino, where you can eat and drink similar 
gems. 
</P>
<P>
Enoteca Pinchiorri opened in Florence as a wine bar/wine shop and has expanded 
into one of Italy's most celebrated restaurants. Giorgio Pinchiorri is the 
wizard of the wine, and his wife, Annie Feolde, is the wizard of the kitchen. 
Theirs is a magical marriage. All wineareas of Italy are represented, not just 
Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Signor Pinchiorri has an estimable selection of French wines as well. 
But who comes to Italy to drink French wine? Try a 1985 Coltassala from 
Castello Volpaia with the Filetto di vitella all perle di zucca e tartufo nero, 
filet of veal with pumpkin pearls and black truffles. 
</P>
<P>
For dishes and wines such as these, Michelin has awarded the Enoteca Pinchiorri 
two stars. It operates out of a 16th-Century mansion in the center of Florence. 
</P>
<P>
In northeast Italy, Friuli has established itself as Italy's prime white wine 
region (yes, they do make good white wine in this country). Tocai is the local 
wine of preference. The flinty Sauvignon Blanc is fine, and chardonnay is 
becoming more abundant as the winemakers look to international markets. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least another dozen white wine types made, plus some soft fruity 
reds. Actually, more red wine is made in Friuli than white, but the white is 
the reason one goes there. 
</P>
<P>
A century ago, Boschetti was a wayside inn where coaches paused on their 
journeys to Vienna from Venice and Rome. The restaurant/inn has a central 
European feel, particularly so in its wood-paneled dining room, laid out around 
an open Friulian fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
It's eight miles north of Udine in the village of Tricesimo. Boschetti's food 
is devastating and, like Enoteca Pinchiorri, it holds two Michelin stars. 
</P>
<P>
The wines . . . well, the usual 100 choices await. Unless one is up-to-date on 
Friulian wines, a suggestion from the owner, Giorgio Trentin, is valuable. He 
directed us to the sauvignons and chardonnays from Borgo Conventi, and for 
dessert to Giovanni Dri's Ramandolo. 
</P>
<P>
Save room for tasting a few of the grappas (wine spirits) from Nonino. They 
will be rolled to your table in a cart. After a glass or two, it is prudent to 
check into one of the 32 rooms for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours to the west, in the Dolomite Mountains, you can find the oldest wine 
bar in Italy -- Geri's Enoteca in Cortina. It's a tiny place that looks and 
feels like a compartment on the Orient Express. 
</P>
<P>
It can be extremely crowded before lunch and dinner, when people drop by for a 
sip or two before eating. They claim to have 500 different wines, which might 
be just a slight exaggeration. Nevertheless, you can come many times without 
drinking the same wine twice. 
</P>
<P>
Check out the mountain wines from the nearby Alto Adige region. The 
Gewurztraminers of Schloss Schwanburg and the Muller Thurgaus of Roberto Zeni 
or Pojer &amp; Sandri are as light and refreshing as a glacial stream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: TRUFFLE SEASON OR NOT, PIEDMONT'S COUNTRY-STYLE COOKS ARE 
NONPAREIL

CARTOSIO, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Piedmont (from pie di monte or foot of the mountains) is a wine region in 
northwest Italy best known for its Barbaresco and Barolo wines, and for the 
glorious white truffle found in the Langhe and Monterrato hills. 
</P>
<P>
In truffle season (roughly October to January), aficionados from Milan, Turin, 
Switzerland and Germany swoop down on the medieval hill towns and country 
restaurants to feast on truffles and game and fabulous old vintages. Every 
restaurant is fully booked; getting even a simple room takes planning. 
</P>
<P>
What some people forget, since so many are so focused on the heady scent of 
truffles, is that this region boasts wonderful country cooking all year. And 
for my money, the cooking of spring or summer and early fall is far more 
interesting. The pressure is off; this is the quiet season, and cooks can 
concentrate on really cooking. 
</P>
<P>
At Ristorante Cacciatori in Cartosio, a hamlet outside Aqui Terme, Maria Milano 
faces her daughter-in-law Carla across a battered cutting board. The curved 
blade of the mezzaluna (a crescent knife/cutter with two handles) rocks across 
the board, sending up a fragrance of rosemary and sage. 
</P>
<P>
First thing each morning, Milano lights the wood-fired oven that sits beside 
the sturdy gas stove. Light streams in the windows, and two cats watch her 
every move from outside. Her chickpea soup made with pork rind and bones goes 
on a back burner. 
</P>
<P>
She concentrates on the doughs and stuffings, while Carla prepares the meat 
dishes and vegetables. Son, Giancarlo, rolls out the pasta on a smooth pine 
board. 
</P>
<P>
As it gets closer to lunchtime, guests begin to arrive, and poke their heads in 
the kitchen to see what's on for today -- to admire hefty porcini mushrooms, 
the pheasant a hunter has dropped by, or the startling gold of polenta poured 
onto a wooden board. 
</P>
<P>
Giancarlo Milano has no use for show. He believes in the honest and true 
cooking of this region. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make polenta, it should be made the way it really was," Milano said. 
"Why should we serve it on a golden plate and try to elevate this already 
sublime and earthy dish?" 
</P>
<P>
Served with pollo alla cacciatori (hunter's style chicken), the dish has a 
remarkable depth of flavor. It's the farmhouse chicken. It's the mushrooms that 
come from the wooded hillsides nearby. It's the polenta, stirred with a wooden 
stick for a full hour. And it's the experienced hand of the cook. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother has her own natural measure after all these years," Milano said. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen turns out deceptively simple dishes, perfectly executed. 
</P>
<P>
To start, there's focaccia (a rather flat bread, brushed with garlic butter and 
sprinkled with herbs), cooked in a heavy iron skillet, slender stuffed zucchini 
or deep-fried ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta. 
</P>
<P>
Giancarlo then will always inquire what you might feel like eating next. 
</P>
<P>
A raw porcini salad? Transparent slices of exquisitely flavored veal carpaccio 
with a drizzle of Ligurian olive oil? If it's mushroom season, he might offer a 
few of the rare ovoli mushrooms cooked with potatoes in the oven. Or a plate of 
tagliolini, a type of pasta heaped with porcini. He never insists. 
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to eat light, Giancarlo might suggest a boned rabbit rolled with 
herbs and served sliced in its juices, pan-roasted chicken or a small portion 
of fritto misto, one of the classics of Piedmontese cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
It's a mixed fry of tiny veal cutlets, brain, marrow, sweet semolina balls, 
artichokes, sage leaves, apple slices and more. For dessert, try creme caramel 
cooked in the wood-fired oven or zabaglione made with a fragrant moscato d'Asti 
(a sweet wine) and served in a cup and saucer. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for Piedmontese wines from Angelo Gaja, Bruno Giacosa, Aldo Conterno, 
Ceretto, and Scarpa and Vietti are very low, based on what the Milanos paid 
when the wines were first released. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite with local winemakers is La Contea in Neive d'Alba, a 
diminutive medieval hill town next to Barbaresco's famous vineyards. The 
setting is a 17th-Century palazzo on a tiny piazza just below the church, which 
once belonged to the counts of Neive. 
</P>
<P>
On winter mornings, the restaurant is filled with the heady scent of truffles 
as truffle hunters gather in front of the marble fireplace, and townspeople 
troop in for an espresso at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
With soft candlelight reflected on frescoed ceilings and faded gilt wallpaper, 
the aristocratic rooms are a romantic setting for Claudia Verro's regional 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
In summer, the tall windows are flung open on the cherry tree outside, 
old-fashioned roses fill the vases, and Verro concentrates on lighter, summer 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
One of Italy's top chefs, she enjoys researching old recipes and has written a 
seasonal cookbook. Her kitchen garden provides her with masses of fresh herbs 
and organically grown vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
A summer meal here might begin with fresh salmon carpaccio crostini topped with 
the artichoke hearts, green tomatoes, sweet peppers or eggplant she puts up in 
olive oil every summer. 
</P>
<P>
There may be slices of peppery homemade salami, hazelnut bread and grissini, 
the crunchy breadsticks that accompany every meal in Piedmonte. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty egg yolks go into every kilo of flour to make her silken pasta. Among 
the best pasta dishes: her maltagliate ("badly cut" scraps of pasta dough) with 
herbs and robiola cheese, and her carbonara monferrato sauced with raw egg, 
Parmesan and pancetta (Italian bacon), and showered with fresh fava beans, 
asparagus and zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
Next might come salmon or trout in a gritty hazelnut sauce, tender little lamb 
chops with thyme or pigeon alla diavola, cooked rare. One very old Piedmontese 
dish is finanziera, a rich innards stew with cockscombs, an essential 
ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
Her version transforms it with spring peas, asparagus, fresh fava beans, bits 
of zucchini and the requisite marrow, and cockscombs (yes, the real thing -- 
crunchy little zigzags) in a sauce with lots of herbs. 
</P>
<P>
Or she might make Tonino Verro's grandmother's recipe for braised duck, serving 
it with a bundle of slender asparagus, tiny pan-roasted potatoes and peas with 
pancetta on a bed of creamy polenta. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, there's lemon or grape sorbetto, moist hazelnut torta with honey, 
or bonet, a loaf-shaped coffee or chocolate custard, cut in slices. 
</P>
<P>
Tonino Verro is the ebullient host and maitre d', and he seems to be everywhere 
at once -- on the phone, making appointments for clients and guests to visit 
winemakers, rushing off to Imperia on the Ligurian coast to pick up a special 
olive oil, or up the precipitous drive to Castelmagno to buy cheese made in 
mountain villages there. 
</P>
<P>
He's also got an excellent, broad-ranging cellar of Piedmontese wines, and a 
good selection of grappas at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Lidia Alciati at the more formal Guido, a Michelin two-star restaurant in 
Costigliole d'Asti, cooks only in the evenings and then only by reservation and 
never for more than 36 people. 
</P>
<P>
That's because, unlike a French two-star restaurant, she has no brigade of 
junior cooks slaving away cutting vegetables, skimming stock and saucing 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
The middle son, Ugo, now bakes bread and exquisitely light pastries under his 
mother's tutelage, but other than that, Alciati is entirely alone in the 
kitchen and insists on cooking every dish herself. That may be why the food is 
so consistently good. 
</P>
<P>
Alciati is a traditionalist who's most at home cooking the classics of 
Piedmontese cuisine, yet her presentations are austerely elegant: a dome of 
duck liver mousse is crowned with shaved white truffles, a cold rabbit 
galantine garnished with strawberry-scented aspic. 
</P>
<P>
But it's taste that's most important to her -- the rich shock of her wild 
mushroom soup enriched with egg yolks and Parmesan, or her ethereal handmade 
agnolotti (a variety of raviolo) with a subtle stuffing of chopped veal and 
pork roasts, cheese and greens. 
</P>
<P>
She might have venison or succulent capretto (roasted kid) fed on sweet spring 
grasses, or a stracotto (a veal or beef stew) cooked in the same '78 Barolo her 
husband Guido pours to accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
Guido Alciati knows every inch of the Langhe hills, every plot of vines, every 
cellar. He logs almost 100,000 miles on his car every year in search of the 
best local ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
He visits the farmer who raises capretto (kid) or baby goat for him, stops by 
another for the zucchini flowers and fresh herbs. He has special sources for 
tender robiola di Roccaverrano made from half goat's milk, half pecora or 
sheep's milk. 
</P>
<P>
And his truly extraordinary cellar is filled with thousands of bottles of 
Barbarescos and Barolos laid down years ago, and served only when he deems them 
ready to drink. He buys only in the good years and in quantity. Prices for 
these top wines are still astonishingly low. 
</P>

NGADISARI, Indonesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My young guide's boyish thinness hid a remarkable, wiry energy. When he smiled 
up at me, his teeth were yellowed from filterless cigarettes and sugar 
cane-chewing. 
</P>
<P>
No more than 16 years old and apparently immune to exhaustion, he walked my 
sturdy mountain pony the entire seven miles from the mountain village of 
Ngadisari to Mt. Bromo, one of Java's still-active volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by craggy peaks and a vast sea of sand, Bromo has an eerie, 
end-of-the-world feeling, especially at sunrise. On horseback with a local 
guide, it's an all-night trip across a lunar landscape, exhausting and utterly 
unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
With no shoes on his feet to cushion them from the cracked earth, the boy 
commanded my horse to keep to the path with clucks of his tongue and 
alien-sounding words. 
</P>
<P>
As the inky night surrounded us, I could hear 10 other bleary-eyed adventurers 
clip-clopping behind us, tourists from at least three other continents. We were 
all strangers to this road, lost in the stars that hovered like UFOs, just 
beyond our grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, most of the province of East Java is flatter than the rest of 
the country, with long plains of rice fields and lowland deltas. But Mt. Bromo 
rises from the Tengger Massif, with the highest mountains in Java. It's an 
altogether raw, undisturbed region, rich with Indonesia's melding of ancient 
religion and superstition. 
</P>
<P>
As we moved deeper into the forest, I began to wonder if my guide knew where we 
were headed, so blinding was the darkness. What if he became as disoriented in 
this mountain world as I felt? But he'd assured me he'd made the trip at least 
200 times before, so it was merely a question of trust. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted this new experience, leaving behind my dusty, day-to-day regime to 
climb an ancient crater and look upon the sun at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
But for all my expectations, I never realized we'd be passing through a magic 
Twilight Zone time warp that I may never see again. No traveler to this part of 
the globe should overlook a chance at this expedition. It's a long walk into 
the very heart of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing higher into the hills, the clouds moved in a slow procession beneath 
the moon, hanging like a sliver of white melon on a dark canvas. A whisper of 
damp mist clung to my cheeks and hair. At any time of the year, it's cold in 
these mountains, and a wild wind can whip down the slopes with no warning. 
</P>
<P>
The wet chill began to seep into the blankets my guide had wrapped around me 
back at the village, when he'd seen I'd worn only a sweatshirt for the trek. 
</P>
<P>
A minibus had picked me up in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, where 
the air is hot and heavy, but by the time we'd reached the high village of 
Ngadisari, the sharp contrast in temperature was all too apparent. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal time of year to visit Bromo at dawn is the dry season, from April 
through November, when the sky is clearest at sunrise, and you can be 
guaranteed a colorful sight. 
</P>
<P>
After signing the visitor's book in the local police station, (a pink shack 
with rusty metal table and two worn leather armchairs), visitors pay the stable 
man 5,000 rupiah (about $5 U.S.) for a pony and guide. 
</P>
<P>
Though the journey begins at three in the morning, tiny oil lamps burn in huts 
along the slanting cobblestoned road, leading travelers out of the village. 
Ascending into the hills, the steady rhythm of hooves echoing through the 
trees, all else is darkness. Dense and shadowy, they seemed to change into a 
haunted wood, long branches twisting and stretching towards the sky like 
solidified wind. 
</P>
<P>
There is a very real belief in ghosts and various benevolent and malevolent 
spirits in Java, reflecting the Javanese ability to absorb and practice 
different beliefs. Nominally Muslim, their religion is a mix of Hinduism and 
Islam, stirred with their age-old mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
Graveyards are generally thought to be haunted. Magical powers are said to be 
concentrated in amulets and heirlooms, like the Javanese dagger called the 
kris. The dukun, the traditional medicine man, is still consulted over modern 
doctors when sickness strikes. 
</P>
<P>
This is the highest region of East Java, where Mt. Bromo is edged in lush 
sloping farmland composed of rich volcanic soil where almost anything can grow. 
</P>
<P>
The center for the Tenggerese farmers, they cultivate market vegetables on the 
slanting hills, eking out an income in centuries-old traditions. No television 
static cracks the stillness of their nights. No streetlights break their 
curtain of dreams -- only the moon brightens their midnights, lighting the 
rooftops of their hillside shacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sticking stubbornly to their beliefs, the Tenggerese worship as their ancestors 
once did on Mount Bromo's crater. Climbing the volcano each January, a colorful 
procession of farmers and their families throw offerings into the crater at 
dawn, begging the bubbling god of the volcano for peace and good crops. 
</P>
<P>
Local legend has it that the great Tengger crater was dug out with just half a 
coconut shell by an ogre, smitten with love for a beautiful princess. When the 
king of the land saw that the ogre might fulfill the task of digging he'd set 
for the hand of his daughter (which had to be completed in a single night), he 
cruelly ordered his servants to pound rice, as they did each morning. 
</P>
<P>
The cocks began to crow, thinking it was sunrise. The poor ogre, believing he 
had failed, flung away the coconut, which locals say became Mt. Batok, another 
nearby volcano. The trench he dug became the Sand Sea, which we were now about 
to cross. Alas, the poor giant died of exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Our ponies halted at the crest of a rise, and the path curved downhill like a 
serpent. Beneath lay a valley, shrouded in foamy fog. My guide began to move 
forward, leading me into this acid whiteness, where the clouds of heaven seemed 
to touch earth. The voices of my companions were lost in the cool night as we 
separated, the blanket of mist drawing us into the valley's wet heart. 
</P>
<P>
Bromo is actually a crater within a crater, one of four mountains that have 
emerged within the Tengger volcano. This flat Sand Sea between the craters is a 
Martian landscape, and the heavy fog masks all landmarks in the dead of night. 
</P>
<P>
As we crossed this desert, I remembered reading that in this region, they once 
sacrificed young virgins to the spirits by throwing them into the glowing 
craters. This void of blind night suddenly seemed eternal. My guide flashed a 
penlight on and off to trace our path, marked in white on rocks, carefully 
placed along the ground like tears of dried lava. 
</P>
<P>
Light was breaking dimly in a distant corner of the valley, drawing aside the 
curtain of mist. The violet veil of dawn lifted, and a new day was beginning. 
The first rays shot over the primeval landscape, turning spooky night to 
comforting morning. Just ahead, we could see the puffing craters of Bromo and 
his brothers -- they'd been directly in front of us the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded so suddenly by these majestic, red-earthed giants in the dawn light, 
I felt a very small being indeed. The brochure from the tourist office that had 
first drawn me to Bromo now seemed very apt. In a delightful use of English, it 
had read: 
</P>
<P>
"Only at Bromo, 2,383 meters above sea level, can one see how lustrous the 
aurora of the sun, in mixing colors of white, pale yellow, yellowish red 
turning red appears from behind the hills in front, to brighten the atmosphere 
to daylight, does one feel oneself to be like one grain of small green pea amid 
a vessel of sand." 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't have put it better myself. It was as if we'd stumbled through a 
doorway into "The Land That Time Forgot." A pterodactyl, winging its way across 
the valley, was all the scene lacked. But we were alone, for nothing lives 
here. The only sounds come from the belching volcanoes, lustily vocalizing 
their powers over the province. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of Mt. Bromo, the acrid smell of sulphur hit us as we dismounted 
and stretched our legs. A rickety staircase of timber pointed like a crooked 
finger to the rim of the crater, 246 steps, straight up. We were just in time 
to greet the sun as it rose over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
One energetic couple in their 60s passed me on the way up. At the top of this 
ancestral altar, everyone stood in silence. I felt tiny and insignificant, 
watching the ghosts of the night vanish in a blaze of golden warmth. 
</P>
<P>
I focused my camera on one of the distant giants, and one perfect white cloud 
spewed out, like a prehistoric smoke ring. Staring deep into Bromo's crater, we 
noticed one courageous scoundrel had carved his initials in the white ash rock 
a hundred feet below near a gurgling pool of lava, tattooing the august 
sentinel with his ant-like scribblings. 
</P>
<P>
With the sun came the first heat of the day, and I pulled the rough blankets 
from my shoulders. Ahead of me, people walking at the edge of the crater looked 
like shadows thrown on a screen, the blinding sun turning them to silhouettes.

Indonesia offers 13,000 islands and some of the most astounding sights and 
musical sounds in Asia. Mythical dragons still live here on the island of 
Komodo, butterflies grow bigger than your fist, and Javanese puppetmasters spin 
stories of centuries gone by. And the sun rises over Mt. Bromo like no other 
sunrise you've seen. 
</P>
<P>
As I stood at its edge, I knew that somewhere the 20th Century was progressing 
into another era, but it was somewhere else, far away from this mystical 
wedding between the world that we knew, and a world we'd never seen.

FOOTLOOSE: GREEKS CALL RHODES 'ISLAND OF ROSES' 
</P>

RHODES, Greece 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of visitors arrive here every year. The attraction is a 
large, lush and fertile island, blessed with year-round sunshine and beautiful 
beaches, although midwinter temperatures hardly allow for lazy days on the 
sands. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes is known throughout Greece as the "Island of Roses." There are also 
brilliant red and purple hibiscus, great waterfalls of bougainvillea and 
countless other flowers that lend color and bouquet to the island. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the bronze, 106-foot Colossus of Rhodes actually stood astride the 
entrance to Rhodes' Mandraki Harbor in the 4th Century BC still is a matter of 
conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
Legend holds that the Colossus sank slowly into the sea after an earthquake. 
Some locals claim that one more high-rise hotel could seal a similar fate for 
the entire island. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly TWA, Pan Am or KLM to Athens, all with stops. Olympic Airways 
will fly you nonstop from New York, and also Athens to Rhodes. The 
advance-purchase, round-trip fare between Los Angeles and Athens is between 
$1,010 and $1,110, depending on month and day of week flown. Olympic's 
Athens-Rhodes leg takes 50 minutes and costs $84. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give the town of Rhodes a couple of days and allow another 
two for forays about the island and for beach time. Athens was recently named 
the least expensive of major European cities, and this value spills over into 
other parts of Greece, so hotels are moderate in cost. The food is great and 
the wine is inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Greek drachmas recently sold at 161 to the dollar, making 
them worth about .006 cents each. The best time to visit the Greek Isles is 
from early spring to late fall. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: In general, the high season runs from July 1 until the end 
of October, with medium season from mid-May until July. Many hotels require 
half-pension during high season. 
</P>
<P>
Plaza Hotel (mid-town; $51 B&amp;B double, medium season; $76 half-pension, 
high season), a large and modern place, is within easy walking distance of the 
walled Old Town, shops, the harbor and beach. It has the usual pool, sauna, 
fitness room, bar, restaurant and other such resort necessities. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrooms are contemporary in style, most with balconies facing the sea, city or 
pool and terrace gardens. The Plaza is very convenient for those wishing to 
stay afoot during their visit. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanis (Ixia Beach; $71 B&amp;B double, high season; $90 half-pension) is 
three miles from town and has recently undergone a major renovation. It, too, 
is very contemporary, having all of the amenities of the Plaza, including a 
pool-side bar serving snacks and drinks throughout the day and evening. 
</P>
<P>
Most bedrooms have balconies facing the beach and sea just across the road. 
</P>
<P>
Rodos Bay Hotel (Ixia Beach; $89 double, half-pension, high season; $45 B&amp;B 
double, medium season) gets our nod as Rhodes' best value, a large but warm 
hotel that in two decades has established a steady clientele of loyal Europeans 
and Americans. 
</P>
<P>
There's a huge outdoor pool, plus another enclosed on the 11th floor. All 
bedrooms have spacious balconies for sunning. The 10th-floor main dining room 
overlooks the Bay of Rhodes, and an open-air taverna in the garden has 
marvelous Greek food and evening music for dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Greek meals always begin with mezes, a surprising 
array of appetizers usually taken with a splash of ouzo (an anise-flavored 
liquor). Your waiter will surely bring you a plate of tzatziki, a heavenly dip 
of cucumber, garlic and yogurt. Taramosalata, another spread made with red carp 
roe, bread, garlic and lemon juice, is another favorite. Heartiest of the lot 
is skorda lia, yet another dip made of almost pure garlic, potatoes and olive 
oil. This one makes a marvelous topping for fried fish. 
</P>
<P>
Staple main courses include every seafood imaginable, souvlakia (lamb, beef, 
veal or fish grilled on a skewer) and the world-acclaimed moussaka, a casserole 
of ground meat and eggplant topped with a bechamel sauce. From these few 
basics, branch out into the happy adventure of other Greek dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Greece's retsina wine (flavored with resin) is an acquired taste. It's the 
perfect white wine for most Greek food, but numerous aretsina (without the 
resin) and red wines are available everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Good local dining: Alexis (26 Socrates St.) must certainly be the town's best 
restaurant. Dine inside or beneath a 110-year-old plane tree in the patio, on 
tender swordfish souvlaki grilled to perfection, Lindos Bay lobster, baked 
fangri (sea bass) or a variety of wondrous meat souvlakia. 
</P>
<P>
Inside decor at Taverna Fotis (8 Menekleous St.) would do little credit to a 
bicycle repair shop, but outside beneath another gigantic tree you'll find 
tables to enjoy some of the island's best seafood. Once the almost exclusive 
venue of locals, Fotis has caught on with visitors for its fine food and 
moderate prices. 
</P>
<P>
Try the calamari, fangri or perhaps the tastiest of all, barbounia, a red 
mullet with zillions of small bones but glorious flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Taverna Hippocrates (10 Evripidou St.) seems to be the town meeting place, and 
waiters serving terrace tables on Hippocrates Square can become a bit manic at 
times. But the garden is open May to October, and you'll find a lengthy menu of 
seafood and other Greek specialties. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: When the religious-military order of the Knights of St. John were 
driven from Jerusalem by the Turks in the late 13th Century, they went first to 
Cyprus and then to Rhodes, where they remained until the Turkish invasion of 
1522. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the walled Old Town and its buildings bear the architectural stamp of 
the Knights' seven "tongues," or nations, particularly the Provencal Gothic 
style. Be sure to visit the 14th-Century Palace of the Grand Masters, its 
interior given rather fanciful theatrical interiors by 20th-Century Italian 
occupiers, and the 15th-Century Knights Hospital, which now houses a fine 
archeological museum containing relics and statuary dating from the 6th Century 
BC. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the village of Lindos (28 miles south) is a must for its lovely 
beach, hilltop acropolis and massive fortress. Lindos dates from prehistoric 
times, and it was a major stronghold of the Knights of St. John in defending 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Rhodes, stop at a cafe under the arcades fronting Mandraki Harbor for 
an afternoon or evening drink. The scene can become as animated as Venice's St. 
Marks Square at midsummer, so plan on a table wait. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Greek National Tourist Office at (213) 626-6696, 
or write (611 West 6th St., Suite 2198, Los Angeles 90017) for a brochure on 
Rhodes with city map and hotel listing, another on Athens, a map of Greece and 
general brochure on travel within the country. Ask for the Rhodes package.

HOW TO MAKE YOUR MT. BROMO TREK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lisa Marlowe 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting there: Garuda Indonesia Airlines flies from Los Angeles to Surabaya, 
Java. Round-trip air fare is $1,155. Garuda offers three flights daily to 
Surabaya from Bali. The 30-minute flight costs $39.50 each way. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Bromo tour: Orient Express Tours and Travel Service, headquartered in 
Surabaya, can arrange a trip to Mt. Bromo from anywhere in Indonesia. The 
standard tour includes one night in a first-class hotel in Surabaya, 
transportation to and from the airport and Ngadisari, a pony and guide, plus 
breakfast in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tour group's English-speaking hosts will accompany you up the 
volcano. Price: $100 per person. Contact: Jalan Majen, Sungkong No. 202, 
Surabaya. The company also has an office at the Hyatt Bumi Hotel in Surabaya. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations: In Surabaya, the tourist-class Garden Hotel is centrally 
located and has three restaurants, including one on the rooftop overlooking the 
city, plus a swimming pool and sauna. All rooms are air-conditioned and include 
bath. Rates: $35 per day single, $45 double. Address: Garden Hotel, Jalan 
Pemuda 21. 
</P>
<P>
Just behind the Garden Hotel stands the newer Garden Palace Hotel with 250 
rooms, three restaurants, a pub and a rooftop pool. Rates: $55 single, $65 
double. Address: Jalan Yos Sudarso 11. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a first-class Hyatt hotel in Surabaya, the Hyatt Bumi. Rates are 
$90 double. Rooms can be booked by calling (800) 228-9000 inCalifornia. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Hotels have a 21% service charge. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to stay in the mountains in Ngadisari, there are plenty of 
villagers who will offer you a room for the night, though the quality varies. A 
basic room costs about $5. Right on the rim of the Tengger Crater, Hotel Bromo 
Permai is a good place to stay for the views of Mt. Bromo. It's friendly and 
offers good value, with dorm beds for $4 or small rooms for $10. Very basic. 
Also has a small restaurant and bar. 
</P>
<P>
Dining: Restaurants in Surabaya are good but can be slightly more expensive 
than those in Bali or other parts of Indonesia. The Chez Rose on Jalan Sudirman 
is a great place to splurge if you want a continental break from Indonesian 
food. Hotel restaurants are usually excellent, with Western and Indonesian 
menus. Also of note is the Zangrandi Ice Cream Palace, where the wealthy 
Surabayans pull up in their Mercedes for treats. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping: Surabaya has no particular crafts of its own, but is a good hunting 
ground for antiques. A number of small shops at the junction of Jalan Basuki 
Rakhmat and Urip Sumoharjo have low prices and interesting odds and ends. 
Tunjungan Shopping Centre is the stop for low-priced music cassettes and small 
gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation: Surabaya has a good bus system, plenty of taxis, becaks 
(three-wheeled cycle rickshaws where the driver sits behind you) and bemos 
(pickup trucks with benches for passengers). All forms of transport are very 
inexpensive. A taxi to or from the airport is about $5.

MISSED ON MULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In our estimation, Bill Gale ("Best Thing to Mull Over in Scotland is Nothing," 
July 29) missed a fine opportunity during his visit to Mull, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
On a headland directly across from Oban stands the ancient but fully 
operational and lived-in-to-this-day Duart Castle. 
</P>
<P>
It's the ancient home of the McLeans of Mull, not to be confused with the 
McLains, who are a mainland clan. The McLean, chief of the clan, is in 
residence today, or was a few years ago when we had an audience with him on a 
visit to Mull. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the Scottish side of Dexter's family were Rankins who were 
pipers for the McLeans, and my McLean blood comes down from a former Supreme 
Court Justice of the same name. Gale, of course, may have Campbell or Argyll 
antecedents that could account for his laxity or oversight. Believe me, it 
would be worth another trip to Mull for him just to fill that apparent void in 
his education.

ABOUT OLD HAWAII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Hulse's story July 15, "Hawaii, My Old Friend," was great for a lot of 
reasons, not the least of which was his listing of the inexpensive lodgings in 
out-of-the-way places. I'm a little tired of publications assuming we can all 
spend, or even want to spend, $250 a night on a room.

YOUTH BEAT: HOSTELS OFFER INEXPENSIVE LODGINGS AROUND THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick: What do a battleship in Massachusetts, a castle in the English 
countryside, a prison in Ottawa, a clipper ship in Stockholm and a couple of 
treehouses in Georgia have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Each provides budget accommodations and is affiliated with the 
International Youth Hostel Federation (IYHF). 
</P>
<P>
Youth hostels provide clean, safe, inexpensive accommodations, often in small, 
dormitory-type rooms. Most guests are 18 to 24 years of age, but few hostels 
impose age restrictions. There are more than 5,200 IYHF hostels worldwide, 
providing more than 370,000 beds in 59 countries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to financial savings, hostels also offer an excellent atmosphere 
for solo travelers. Communal kitchens and lounges are ideal settings in which 
to meet other travelers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the IYHF's 1989 annual report, the countries in which American 
travelers spent the most nights were West Germany, England, Wales, Switzerland, 
Israel, Italy, Austria, France, Australia, the Netherlands and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers are encouraged to purchase an IYHF membership, which costs $25 per 
year, from their own national hostel association before leaving home. Although 
guest passes are sold abroad, if you buy before you go, some of the money will 
be used to support the local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the membership fee also is earmarked for hostel development in 
underdeveloped countries, plus other special projects. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Kenya's association this year was able to open a simple hostel in 
Samburu bush country. In addition to the dormitory rooms, it contains some 
facilities for couples. It also has camping, often with zebra grazing around 
the sites. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the recent changes in Eastern Europe, IYHF funding was used to 
produce a free map, in six languages, with information to assist young people 
from Eastern Europe who want to visit Western European countries. A special 
IYHF membership card also is available to young people from this area, at a 
cost of $2. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main focuses of IYHF in the past several years has been the 
development and upgrading of youth hostels in key gateway cities. For example, 
in the past two years, New York City got its first IYHF hostel (500 beds). 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Le D'Artagnan was renovated and reopened (400 beds); in Auckland, New 
Zealand, a new hostel opened with 140 beds (maximum four per room); a facility 
was opened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (14 air-conditioned rooms), and 
construction has begun on a new one in the Banglumpoo area of Bangkok, 
Thailand, with the opening expected in October. 
</P>
<P>
A new hostel has opened in Dublin, and, for the first time, the youth hostels 
in Northern and Southern Ireland are covered in a joint handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Many national hosteling associations have travel services, and the trend is to 
market each other's "do-it-yourself" touring packages. In some cases you'll 
have to contact the foreign association directly to find out if it has anything 
suitable. 
</P>
<P>
Finland, for example, offers packages combining bus, rail and bicycle transport 
with hostel accommodations. Belgium's association has its own bike-touring club 
and invites foreign members to join. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on the IYHF network, or hosteling at home, contact 
American Youth Hostels, Los Angeles Council, 335 West 7th St., San Pedro 90731, 
(213) 831-8846.

DODGERS' TRAIL GETS A LITTLE SHORTER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: JAVIER KNOCKS IN THE GAME-WINNER TO BEAT EXPOS, 3-2. REDS' LEAD CUT 
TO 6 1/2 GAMES, THE SMALLEST SINCE MAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Six and a half weeks. Six and a half games. 
</P>
<P>
As the season grows shorter, so does the gap. And the Dodgers seem to loom ever 
larger as a threat to the Cincinnati Reds, season-long leaders in the National 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
Time may be the Reds' biggest ally as the Dodgers continue to play the best 
ball in their division. 
</P>
<P>
They beat the Montreal Expos Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, 3-2, before a 
sellout crowd of 45,687 to move as close to the top as they have been since May 
9. 
</P>
<P>
With the San Francisco Giants losing, the Dodgers also moved into sole 
possession of second place for the first time since late May and moved five 
games above .500 (62-57) for the first time all season. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference," said coach Joe Ferguson, "is that on May 9, we were going 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
Stan Javier drove in the winning run with a seventh-inning single off reliever 
Mel Rojas, scoring Alfredo Griffin, who had walked and moved to second on a 
sacrifice by Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Rojas from the Dominican," Javier said. "I never got any hits off him 
there, but it's a different story up here. I like to be in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela (10-10) went seven innings to get the victory. Jim Gott got the 
save, his third. All three have come within the last eight days after he went a 
year and a half without one because of an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you explain it?" Gott said. "I realize it's just the benefit of hard 
work. I can't thank the Dodgers enough for their patience. There have been 
times when I haven't been a major league pitcher for them." 
</P>
<P>
The loss went to Rojas (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
It took the Dodgers 3 1/3 innings to get a hit off Expo starter Chris Nabholz, 
but when they finally broke through, they made the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson broke up the no-hitter with a hard liner that flew under the glove 
of second baseman Delino DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had a shot at the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray smacked it halfway into the left-field pavilion for his 19th home 
run of the season to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead. It was Murray's first home 
run in 53 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal used the home-run ball to tie the game after two were out in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Nixon walked and stole second. Tim Raines followed with a fly ball to deep 
left. Gibson chased it to the wall at the 370-foot sign and leaped high into 
the air. But all he could do was grab the top of the wall and cling to it like 
a basketball player hanging on the rim as the ball cleared his glove, tying the 
game at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was Raines' sixth homer. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Dodgers' fifth in a row at home against Montreal. All five 
have been one-run games, four of the five by the score of 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to worry about the standings," Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia 
said. "Let's just keep coming together and we'll read the paper at the end of 
the season and see where we come out." 
</P>
<P>
But is there enough time left in the rapidly shrinking season to catch 
Cincinnati? 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm thinking about is tomorrow," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "That's all I 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Relievers Ray Searage and Don Aase have again switched places. Saturday, the 
Dodgers placed Searage, suffering from an inflammation of the left elbow, on 
the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to August 15. Aase, on the DL since July 
2 because of tendinitis in his right shoulder, has been activated. Searage was 
1-0 with a 2.97 earned-run average in 27 games. He had previously been on the 
DL with inflammation problems from May 11 to July 2, the day Aase went on the 
disabled list. Aase was 2-1 with a 2.62 ERA and three saves in 23 games before 
getting hurt. Before his return, Aase went down to Bakersfield to get some game 
action. In six appearances there, he compiled a 1.00 ERA. . . . Tim Belcher, 
placed on the disabled list Friday because of tendinitis in his pitching 
shoulder, doesn't plan on being gone long. "Hopefully, it won't be longer than 
the 15 days," he said. "It just got to the point where I wasn't getting any 
better. Dr. (Frank) Jobe suggested that I take some time off. I wasn't helping 
the team a great deal anyway. I won't throw now for 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, perhaps hoping to inspire shortstop Jose Offerman, gave him No. 30 
after recalling him from Albuquerque Friday. Offerman stole 60 bases in 116 
games for the Dukes. No. 30 used to belong to another Dodger shortstop with 
some base-stealing talent: Maury Wills. . . . Pitcher Jim Neidlinger's wife, 
Ann, gave birth to the couple's first child Saturday, a girl as yet unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hollywood Stars game that preceded the Dodgers and Expos, the big hits 
were an inside-the-park home run by Jason Bateman and a triple by Corbin 
Bernsen. . . . The series concludes at 1 p.m. today with a Martinez matchup, 
the Dodgers' Ramon (15-5) against Montreal's Dennis (9-8).

JIM MURRAY: HE MAKES THE ROYALS BULLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the year everything was to be up-to-date in Kansas City. The Royals 
were going to go about as far as they could go. Like, the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? They had two Cy Young pitchers. Bret Saberhagen was already there, and 
they acquired Mark Davis at about the cost of Rhode Island. They had Mr. 
Everything, Bo Jackson, stopping off in Kansas City on his way to take over the 
world. They had the Right Honorable George Brett, probably the best pure 
striker of the baseball in the game. There was Mark Gubicza, who had won 35 
games in two years. Willie Wilson was still beating out infield hits, and even 
at 39, Frank White was playing second base as if he invented it. 
</P>
<P>
You had to say this team was ready. Nothing left but the reception at City Hall 
and the parade. You almost felt sorry for the rest of the league. This was a 
juggernaut. When they picked up Storm Davis, a 19-game winner with Oakland the 
year before, you wondered why the commissioner didn't step in. Or even the 
Humane Society. I mean, you're talking the 1927 Yankees here. The Lombardi 
Packers. Vegas liked them. The league liked them. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lovely team. The on-paper all-everything. Not a hole in them. 
Cooperstown, here we come! 
</P>
<P>
Well, it didn't turn out quite the way it looked on paper. It seldom does. It 
turned out this team was like the old Austro-Hungarian cavalry. They looked 
great in parades or the Emperor's Waltz but weren't so good when the shooting 
started. They kept coming back with their gold epaulets shot off and their fur 
hats in the dust. The music stopped too soon. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, the Royals' Cy Youngs looked more like Sayonara. Mark Davis 
couldn't save bottle tops. George Brett, who once batted .390, struggled all 
year to get to .300. Bo Jackson was Bo Jackson -- a great soloist, but the team 
was on its own. Bo did his thing. The team was just the chorus. After all, who 
ever asked Caruso how the opera went? 
</P>
<P>
No one could really figure out what the Royals lacked. And then, all of a 
sudden, it became clear: What they lacked was Danny Tartabull. 
</P>
<P>
Who? you may ask. How can a team that boasts Bret Saberhagen, George Brett, 
Mark Davis, Willie Wilson and company lack a . . . er, what kind of a bull did 
you say this was? 
</P>
<P>
Well, consider the Royals spent most of the summer in the cellar -- and Danny 
Tartabull spent most of it on the bench, or in the trainer's room, and you 
begin to get a clue. 
</P>
<P>
Because when Tartabull got healthy again in late July and hit the lineup in 
August, it was a great day for Royalty. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals aren't exactly printing World Series tickets, but they're out of the 
cellar. They're still 18 1/2 games behind Oakland, but since Tartabull played 
himself back into the lineup, the team is 16-4. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull drove in runs in 14 games of that mini-spurt. He hit three homers in 
10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The renaissance illustrates a basic point of baseball: It isn't always the 
superstars who mean the most to the success of the team. Ted Williams never 
really was able to pull the Red Sox along with him. Not even Henry Aaron could 
help the Atlanta Braves, nor Ernie Banks the poor old Cubs. Babe Ruth was the 
exception, but with the cast he headed -- Gehrig, Dickey and Lazzeri hitting 
behind him -- no pitcher could pitch around him. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, a championship team comes up one bat short of a title. That extra 
menace in the middle of a lineup can add up to a dozen games or more in a 
season, often the difference between first and third place -- or first and 
last. It can mean the opposing pitcher sweats a little more on the mound and 
has less room for mistakes. It can result in better pitches for the cleanup 
crew. It can take the pressure off your own pitchers, who can pitch more boldly 
with four- or five-run leads. 
</P>
<P>
It was the role the Royals had in mind for Danny Tartabull when they traded for 
him three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tartabull was probably as natural a right-handed hitter as came along in 1985, 
when he was runner-up in rookie-of-the-year balloting to no less than Jose 
Canseco and Wally Joyner. But he was miscast as an infielder. It was a little 
like Goldie Hawn playing Lady Macbeth. He belonged in an outfield. 
</P>
<P>
He was a second-generation ballplayer. Papa Jose had quit only a decade before, 
after a career with the Athletics and Red Sox; so recent that some thought 
Danny was his own father essaying a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Danny was tacking on numbers his father never achieved. He hit 43 home runs for 
Calgary in his last full minor league season and, when he got to the majors 
with Seattle, he promptly hit 25 homers and drove in 96 runs in his rookie 
year. 
</P>
<P>
He was almost a cult hero with the Mariners, but the team needed pitching and 
Danny was traded to Kansas City for two pitchers and a reserve outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City got what they needed. In his first year, Danny hit .309 with 34 
homers and 101 runs batted in. The next year, he hit .274 with 26 homers and 
102 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
And that's when the Royal flush got busted. "I was shagging flies in the 
outfield one day when suddenly I heard this 'pop!' in my leg," Tartabull says. 
"At first, I thought somebody had thrown a ball at me." 
</P>
<P>
What had happened was, he had torn calf muscles. Tartabull became what baseball 
calls a "day-to-day" player. He could never seem to find a perfectly healthy 
stance even when he came off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals have always had that unsung but indispensable player in the middle 
of the lineup. For years, it was Amos Otis. Then it was Hal McRae. But this one 
was limping to the plate, and the ballclub was limping to the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm healthy, I'm going to hit 25-30 home runs, bat in 90-100 runs and score 
80-90," Tartabull says. He has averaged 25.8 homers a year, .283 at the plate, 
and has 415 RBIs for a little more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
He becomes a free agent later this year. He doesn't play football in the fall. 
He's not the kind of player where the ads will read: "Danny Tartabull and the 
Kansas City Royals Will Be In for the Weekend." But he may be the kind of 
player who makes the difference between playoff and buzz-off.

STARLING'S FIGHT MAY BE HIS LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRICE, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The circle is nearly complete for Marlon Starling. 
</P>
<P>
As an amateur, the question he was asked most was: When are you going to turn 
pro? 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years and 51 professional fights later, the leading question is: When 
are you going to retire? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, boy," Starling said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Just, "Oh, boy." No definitive answer, not even a vague one. Just, "Oh, boy," 
because he wants to say "tomorrow" and he wants to say "never." 
</P>
<P>
Like most professional athletes who have enjoyed long careers, the thought of 
retirement both gladdens and saddens him. Starling has raised the prospect 
regularly the past couple of years, even while in the midst of his greatest 
triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it all could end Sunday when Starling defends his World Boxing Council 
welterweight title against Maurice Blocker. 
</P>
<P>
If Starling wins the fight -- he is a 2-1 favorite to retain the title -- it 
would be surprising, even shocking, to see Starling announce that he is walking 
away from the sport. But it is not completely out of the realm of possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of going out on top is one that surely appeals to Starling, who revels 
in the knowledge that he accomplished much more than most thought he would. He 
could leave without being dethroned and remain forever The Champ. 
</P>
<P>
And there have been subtle signs that could be interpreted as precursors of a 
retirement decision. At a news conference Thursday, Starling was almost overly 
humble, saying that he has been "fortunate" and "lucky to have been fighting 
for as long as I have." 
</P>
<P>
Were they words of thanks now that the end is at hand? Maybe. Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
But Starling has also said he has something "big" to unveil after this fight. 
What? He ruled out marriage, for now. When asked directly if it were 
retirement, he answered, "big fight." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, retirement is a possibility. There are any number of big fights out there 
for Starling. Simon Brown. Meldrick Taylor. Aaron Davis. Buddy McGirt. Even 
Vinnie Pazienza. But promoter Cedric Kushner doesn't have anything lined up as 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
Kushner and Starling met for nearly two hours this week to discuss what the 
future might bring -- Kushner's contract with Starling expires after this fight 
-- and Starling raised the possibility of retirement with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'What would you think if I retired,"' Kushner said. "I told him I 
thought it would be a bad business decision, that he has hit his stride as far 
as making money is concerned. But he's made some bad business decisions in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
Kushner remains confident that Starling will continue fighting at least as long 
as he keeps winning. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take it to the bank, it (retirement) won't happen," Kushner said. "I'm 
sure because he struggled and strained, with difficulty, and had his peaks and 
valleys that the thought of retirement must cross his mind. But I don't believe 
he is genuinely ready to bow out. He loves the adulation and he has to believe, 
correctly, his time is here." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have followed Starling's career closely, people such as Mort Sharnik, 
believe that Starling could keep fighting for at least two more years. But they 
aren't the ones who have to kill themselves to make weight, do the running, the 
sparring and the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired," Starling said. "I'm going to quit. I'm not going to retire. You 
come back when you retire. I'm going to quit. It's coming." 
</P>
<P>
He also is at an age when his skills could go at any moment. He will be 32 Aug. 
29. He has taken care of his body and he has been fortunate to avoid the type 
of punishment that takes a physical or mental toll. That is another reason he 
might like to get out. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, he could hang up his gloves without looking back. 
</P>
<P>
He is a two-time champion. He has made $2.4 million in his past six fights. He 
has bought two homes, one for himself, one for his mother, and made other 
investments. He owns three cars, including a yellow Mercedes-Benz. He has a son 
he cherishes and good friends and a loving family. 
</P>
<P>
The champ has done all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've been a world-known athlete for about a decade or eight years," 
Starling said. "It's not just being a champion. That's just a title. I'm a pro 
in and out of the ring. I think I'm respected by my peers."

RAIDERS' WIN OVER DALLAS IS UGLY, BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the credo of Raider owner Al Davis is "Just Win, Baby," Coach Art 
Shell wasn't satisfied with a 16-14 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in an 
exhibition Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a win, but that's not the way you win in the National Football League," 
Shell said. "We did not play well at all, and I'm disappointed in the way that 
we played." 
</P>
<P>
After beating the two-time defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers 
last weekend, the Raiders struggled against the Cowboys, who have had the NFL's 
worst record for the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in three exhibitions, the Raider offense failed to produce 
a touchdown, settling for Jeff Jaeger's field goals of 31, 47 and 33 yards and 
a 59-yard interception return by defensive tackle Arthur Walker. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we were physical, but when we had opportunities on offense we just 
didn't get the (ball) in the end zone," Shell said. "You've got to make the 
plays and we didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jay Schroeder completed only four of 12 passes for 53 yards in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
After completing 46.9% last year, Schroeder has been unimpressive in the 
exhibition season, completing only 39% in three games. He has completed 16 of 
41 passes for 185 yards with one touchdown and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about percentages," Schroeder said. "That's for you guys to 
write about. You guys are going to make a big deal out of percentage, but I 
don't make a big deal out of percentage. I make a big deal about making the 
plays when you've got to make the plays. And today we didn't do that, and I'll 
take the blame for that." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are continuing to try to sign last year's season-ending starter, 
Steve Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Vince Evans was inconsistent in relief of Schroeder, completing six 
of 18 passes for 66 yards. Evans was the Raiders' most productive rusher, 
gaining 73 yards in eight carries, including a 25-yard scramble. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas quarterback Steve Walsh stood out after Troy Aikman was knocked out of 
the game with a concussion suffered when he was hit by defensive tackle Bill 
Pickel on the fourth play. In his best performance as a pro, Walsh completed 16 
of 25 passes for 191 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Raider offense put some in the crowd of 28,273 to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over at the Dallas 28 after Lionel Washington's 14-yard interception 
return, the Raiders had to settle for a 31-yard field goal by Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
After running back Terrence Flagler returned the following kickoff 69 yards to 
the Raider 22 before he was run out of bounds by Ron Brown, the Cowboys took a 
7-3 lead when Walsh eluded the rush and hit tight end Jay Novacek with a 
one-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Raider emphasis on special teams play paid off when they scored their only 
touchdown on a botched field goal attempt by the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
After a bad snap, Cowboy kicker Ken Willis threw a harried pass into the hands 
of Walker, who ran 59 yards for a touchdown to give the Raiders a 10-7 lead 
with 13:29 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I was going to tackle (Willis), but when I saw the ball in the air I 
reached out and grabbed it," said Walker, who hadn't scored a touchdown since 
he recovered a fumble in the end zone while playing at Booker T. Washington 
High in Houston. "All I saw was open field." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder drove the Raiders to the Dallas 29 on their first series of the 
second quarter, but they settled for a field goal of 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' 13-7 lead didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh directed a 79-yard, 11-play touchdown drive, completing five of nine 
passes for 64 yards, including a five-yard touchdown to fullback Tommie Agee. 
</P>
<P>
After replacing Schroeder in the second half, Evans directed the Raiders to 
what turned out to be Jaeger's game-winning field goal of 33 yards in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman said he probably could have played in the second 
half after being knocked out of the game with a concussion, but the Cowboys 
held him out as a precaution. "I just got knocked a little silly," Aikman said. 
"But I'll be back at practice Tuesday." . . . Raider offensive tackle Doug 
Wilkerson left the game with a sprained left knee in the second quarter, and 
defensive end Emanuel King sustained a sprained right knee in the first 
quarter.

REDS GET GRIFFEY, 40, TO RETIRE TO MAKE ROOM ON THEIR ROSTER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Griffey, a prominent member of Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine" in the 1970s, 
retired Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey, 40, was partially dressed in his uniform when Manager Lou Piniella 
called him into his office before Saturday's game against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella said Griffey, used primarily as a pinch-hitter this season, agreed to 
retire to help the club through a roster problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's accurate," Piniella said. "I talked to Ken. There were a couple 
of options involved and this is the one he chose. I explained the reason to 
Ken, and it was the roster spot." 
</P>
<P>
Griffey spoke to the team briefly, then left the clubhouse. He declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds needed a roster spot for Chris Hammond, who was called up from 
Nashville on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey started five games at first base and four in left field this season. He 
also pinch-hit 31 times. Overall, he batted .206 with one home run and eight 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
His son, Ken Jr. of the Seattle Mariners, made the All-Star team this year. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey spent 13 seasons in the Reds' organization. He was first called up in 
1973 and played his first full major league season in 1975, when the Reds won 
the first of two consecutive world titles. Griffey hit .305 in 1975 and .336 
the next year.

GILT-EDGED BONDS LETS PIRATES GIVE GOOD ACCOUNTING AGAINST REDS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Bonds refuses to talk about his sensational season. But he is easily the 
main reason the Pittsburgh Pirates have a two-game lead in the National League 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds hit a home run and drove in two runs Saturday at Cincinnati to lead the 
Pirates to a 3-1 victory over the Reds and give Zane Smith his second victory 
in two starts for his new team. 
</P>
<P>
With five weeks remaining in the season, there is nobody in the league with 
better credentials for the Most Valuable Player award than the 26-year-old 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds is batting .319 (fourth in the league), has 24 home runs (fifth), 93 runs 
(first), 90 runs batted in (third), 40 stolen bases (third) and 68 walks 
(fourth.). And he is batting .429 with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Smith (8-7) was traded to the Pirates by the Montreal Expos on Aug. 8. He has 
quickly become a believer in Bonds and the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry exemplifies the spirit here," Smith said. "This team wants to win. I 
think it shows in every game we play." 
</P>
<P>
Bonds doubled in a run in the first inning and homered in the fourth to give 
Smith all the support he needed to beat the Reds for the first time in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a left-hander who specializes in getting out left-handed batters with 
off-speed pitches, spent most of his career with Atlanta, for whom he won 15 
games in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He was having a poor season in 1989 when the Expos, in the battle for the East 
title, made a deal for him. The Expos used him in relief and in 31 games he was 
0-1 to finish with a 1-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
In this game he gave up six hits in 7 2/3 innings. The Reds had only one 
left-handed hitter in the lineup, Hal Morris, and he had one of the hits off 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates have won four in a row; the Reds now have lost three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Said Red Manager Lou Piniella: "I've been very patient with a lot of people. 
And, I'll tell you, I'm starting to lose my patience a little bit. I don't know 
what to say. You have to score runs to win, for certain." 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, San Francisco 2 -- David Cone struck out 13 and pitched the Mets to 
their first victory at Candlestick Park in more than a year. Cone had not 
beaten the Giants since 1987 and the Mets had lost seven in a row in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Cone (9-6) has won eight of his past 10 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson (8-5) had only himself to blame. With two out in the third, he 
walked Cone, who has nine hits this season, on four pitches. The left-hander 
never got another out. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Carreon doubled and Dave Magadan singled to left for two runs. Howard 
Johnson also had a two-run single in the five-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
Cone also had two singles and a sacrifice bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 17, Chicago 6 -- It isn't unusual for a lot of runs to be scored at 
Wrigley Field, but it is surprising that there were 35 hits and not one home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lemke had five of the Braves' 24 hits, scored a run and drove in two. 
Rookie Lance Dickson (0-3) was chased in a five-run third inning. 
</P>
<P>
It was a breeze for Charlie Leibrandt (5-7), who ended a four-game losing 
streak. He went six innings, giving up two runs and six hits and getting a 15-2 
lead.

Houston 3, St. Louis 2 -- The Cardinals will be glad when Franklin Stubbs gets 
out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night he broke up Bob Tewksbury's perfect game, and in this game he took 
some luster off rookie Omar Olivares' debut. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares gave up three hits in eight innings and led, 2-1. But Stubbs hit his 
18th home run, off Lee Smith in the ninth, to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs led off the 11th with a single, his fourth hit, and eventually scored 
the winning run on a single by Mark Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, Philadelphia 2 -- Jack Clark's three-run homer with two outs in 
the sixth inning carriedthe Padres to a win at home. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes (9-8) improved his career record against Philadelphia to 5-0, giving 
up seven hits in six innings for the victory. Craig Lefferts pitched the final 
inning for his 19th save. DAN HAFNER

DENVER IS A LOGICAL SITE FOR NL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With the National League scheduled to add two expansion teams in 1993, Denver 
enthusiasts were a mile high, literally and figuratively, after voters in a 
six-county tax district Tuesday approved a 0.1% sales tax that will help fund a 
$140-million, open-air stadium seating about 40,000 and patterned, to an 
extent, on the intimacy of Boston's Fenway Park and Chicago's Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
The tax kicks in only if Denver gets a team, but the 55%-45% approval is seen 
as eliminating the expansion hopes of stadium-less Phoenix and assuring Denver 
of one of the two '93 franchises, providing the NL, as many believe, is seeking 
untapped markets and intending to expand on an East-West basis. 
</P>
<P>
The Rocky Mountain corridor, with a regional population base of about 12 
million to 15 million, would provide the NL with a bridge between St. Louis and 
the West Coast, and a geographical complement to either Orlando or Tampa-St 
Petersburg, Fla., one of which is expected to receive the other franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The new stadium will not be ready until 1995, meaning a Denver team would have 
to share Mile High Stadium with the NFL's Broncos, as Denver's American Assn. 
team does. But the NL's expansion committee has said it can live with a minor 
league arrangement, providing an alternative is on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
The next step for Denver is finding an owner or group of owners willing to pay 
the National League franchise fee of $95 million and another $50 million in 
estimated start-up expenses. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting of interested parties in Denver Friday led to the belief that a 
syndicate including members of Denver's cable television industry (the area is 
known as the Cable Capital), the Coors Brewing Co. and the Scripps-Howard 
newspaper chain (which owns the Rocky Mountain News) is likely. 
</P>
<P>
Interested groups from the various cities must make a presentation to the 
expansion committee by the end of September, though Denver will be given leeway 
because of the late stadium vote. 
</P>
<P>
The NL has also said it will be flexible on the $95-million franchise fee, 
willing to offer a payment plan and friendly terms. 
</P>
<P>
There is no formal or ongoing investigation, but the inquiry into Dave 
Winfield's relationship with Howard Spira and the $15,000 check Winfield gave 
to Spira in 1981 is not entirely closed, according to deputy commissioner Steve 
Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's office, Greenberg said, has an open mind regarding any and 
all material or testimony it receives on (a) the Winfield-Spira relationship 
and (b) allegations that Winfield has gambled. But it has received nothing to 
indicate that further action is warranted or that Commissioner Fay Vincent 
erred in clearing Winfield during the investigation of the New York Yankees' 
George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said Vincent would like to talk with Spira in an effort to establish 
if Winfield knew Spira was a gambler when he gave him the $15,000 check, but 
Spira will not talk to the commissioner until the extortion case, generated 
mainly on the basis of Steinbrenner's charges against Spira, is over. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Klein, Winfield's attorney, was reached at his New York office and 
reiterated that Spira never worked for the Winfield Foundation, as he has 
claimed, and that Winfield was unaware of Spira's gambling or the possibility 
that Spira needed $15,000 to cover gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
According to Klein, Spira at that time worked for a company being formed by the 
late Al Frohman, Winfield's agent. Frohman asked Winfield to lend Spira the 
money, Klein said, and Winfield did it because he owed Frohman money on his 
agent's fee and believed Frohman would pursue Spira if a question of repayment 
ever developed. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the commissioner's office said it is generally believed that 
Frohman knew Spira gambled, but it has not been established that Winfield knew. 
</P>
<P>
Of Vincent's ongoing interest, Klein said: "I'm not aware of it and I've heard 
nothing to indicate Dave should have any ongoing concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Let's see if we have this right: 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Yankees' limited partners have filed a suit seeking to overturn 
Vincent's decision regarding Steinbrenner, who insists that he opposes the 
suit. So do almost all of the limited partners, including Robert Nederlander, 
who, 24 hours before the suit was filed, was selected unanimously by the 
partners to replace Steinbrenner as managing general partner. 
</P>
<P>
Contradictory and confusing? There's more. 
</P>
<P>
Since the federal courts consistently support the commissioner's authority and 
have previously ruled that due process does not necessarily apply to private 
organizations (i.e., the NCAA vs. Jerry Tarkanian), legal experts give the suit 
little chance of succeeding, but that does not foreclose the possibility that a 
preliminary injunction may be issued at Monday's hearing in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
What would that do? Well, under Vincent's ruling, which he has agreed to, 
Steinbrenner must officially resign by Monday. An injunction would allow him to 
remain in power. Otherwise, Jack Lawn, former administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, has been named by Steinbrenner to run the Yankees 
on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Nederlander? According to Greenberg, baseball's ownership 
committee has decided that Nederlander cannot serve on an acting basis. He must 
be investigated by the committee and approved by American and National League 
owners before serving in any capacity other than that of limited partner. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, between the time Steinbrenner steps down (providing an injunction does 
not buy him time) and Nederlander is voted on (which may be mid-September), 
there is a feeling that the Yankee operation will become even more disorganized 
and paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, co-general managers Pete Pederson and George Bradley remain in place, but 
also in limbo, since it always came down to Steinbrenner calling the shots. 
Steinbrenner liked to talk about his "baseball people," but he really was 
talking about himself. 
</P>
<P>
So, what you have is a circus devoid of a ringmaster, with the partners split 
and embarrassed by the suit and the attorney for the plaintiffs accusing 
Vincent of polling and threatening those partners who would not oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Send in the clowns. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where booing Eric Show and Roseanne Barr has been the highlight 
of a disappointing summer for Padre fans, Manager Greg Riddoch won admirers 
with his response to (a) Show's request to be traded and (b) Show's accusations 
that he was undermined and back-stabbed by pitching coach Pat Dobson. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to sit in the corner and cry," Riddoch said of Show, "he can cry 
there alone." 
</P>
<P>
The winningest pitcher of the 1980s, Jack Morris, is 10-15 with a 5.08 
earned-run average and admittedly embarrassed -- by himself and the 
disintegration of his Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I stink, but how do you know around here?" Morris said, accusing the 
Tigers of complacency, an absence of pride and "no light at the end of the 
tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, Morris said, need to clean house. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't take just one move," he said, "it'll take 10." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of moves, the Pittsburgh Pirates made 10 transactions involving 18 
players in a 25-day span through Thursday and may not be through. Neal Heaton, 
1-7 in his last 10 starts after going 9-1 in his first 12, has been nursing a 
sore shoulder and finally may be replaced in the Pirate rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jim Leyland continues to operate by committee. He has received 
victories from 18 pitchers, and eight pitchers have at least one save. 
</P>
<P>
Mike York, a rookie summoned to face the Cincinnati Reds in one game of a 
Friday night doubleheader, became the 12th Pittsburgh starter. He returned to 
Buffalo on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The move that best illustrated the win-now Pittsburgh philosophy came the other 
day when the Pirates sent a package of pitcher Scott Ruskin, a highly regarded 
27-year-old left-hander; outfielder Moises Alou, their No. 1 choice in the June 
1986 draft; and shortstop Willie Greene, their No. 1 pick last year, to the 
Montreal Expos for left-hander Zane Smith and his 45-66 career record. 
</P>
<P>
Of the steep price, Leyland said: "You don't get that many chances to win. The 
people out there care about 1990, not 1994." 
</P>
<P>
Injury of the week: Gary Sheffield of the Milwaukee Brewers left Wednesday 
night's game against the Tigers because of numbness in his feet. The cause: 
Shoelaces on his high-top cleats were tied too tightly. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are bidding to become the first team since introduction of the 
162-game schedule in 1961 to lead every day of the season. The 1970 Reds came 
close, leading every day but one in early April. 
</P>
<P>
Said Manager Lou Piniella: "I've thought all along that the only team the 
Cincinnati Reds had to beat was the Cincinnati Reds."

Punch Line: If Matt Williams -- who batted .200, hit only one home run and 
struck out 11 times when the San Francisco Giants went 2-8 on a trip that ended 
Wednesday -- follows teammates Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell in winning the 
National League's runs batted in title, it will mark only the second time that 
a team has produced three consecutive titlists. The New York Yankees did it 
with Bob Meusel, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1925, '26 and '27. 
</P>
<P>
Add Williams: His main hurdle may not be Joe Carter of the San Diego Padres, 
but the injury wave that has forced the Giants to use the disabled list 14 
times, equaling last year's club record. The Giants have used 45 players, 
including a club-record 23 pitchers, four fewer than the major league 
single-season record shared by the 1915 Philadelphia Athletics, the 1955 Kansas 
City A's and the 1967 New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Whitewash: The New York Yankees have never won fewer than two games of a season 
series from any opponent in their history. They were 2-11 against the Baltimore 
Orioles in 1982, 2-10 against the Minnesota Twins in 1969 and 2-19 against the 
Boston Red Sox in 1912. But with three games remaining against the Oakland 
Athletics, they are 0-9, having been outscored, 43-6. Intimidated? "We sure 
haven't done anything to dispute that," Manager Stump Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
Homerdome: The Metrodome is still that for opponents, but not the Minnesota 
Twins, who have been out-homered there, 58-35. Kent Hrbek has hit only five of 
his 18 home runs at home, and Gary Gaetti has hit only five of 13 there. Adding 
to the power outage, Kirby Puckett has only five extra-base hits in 115 at-bats 
since his last home run on July 15. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's Roll: Bobby Witt of the Texas Rangers is 9-0 with a 1.77 earned-run 
average in his last 11 starts. He set a club single-season record with his 
ninth consecutive victory Wednesday night, a 2-1 win over the Kansas City 
Royals. Of Witt, Royal Manager John Wathan said: "Everybody always knew about 
the arm he had. Now it looks like he finally has it together. We haven't seen 
better stuff from anybody -- I mean, anybody." ROSS NEWHAN

In his autobiography "Bootlegger's Boy," Barry Switzer says that he resigned as 
Oklahoma football coach after a meeting at which he was accused of being around 
drugs and gambling on college football, including the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer writes that he stepped down six days after meeting with former interim 
president David Swank and other school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from the book were printed in The Daily Oklahoman. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said that at the meeting in June 1989, Swank told him he had 
information that Switzer had been in a Las Vegas hotel room in 1983 where 
cocaine was used, that he had bet on games and had manipulated the drug testing 
of Sooner players. Some of the information came from the U.S. attorney's office 
in Oklahoma City, Swank told Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
The former coach writes that none of the allegations were true, but he realized 
after the meeting that his career at Oklahoma was over.

GOLF ROUNDUP;

NORMAN, NICKLAUS FAIL TO SURVIVE FINAL CUT

<P>
There were either two or 24 co-leaders Saturday after the third round of the 
International golf tournament at Castle Rock, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
None of them, however, were named Greg Norman or Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the scoreboard at the Castle Pines Golf Club showed Eduardo Romero of 
Argentina and Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain tied for the top spot, each with 26 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Under the format for the event, however, they were -- in effect -- tied with 22 
others, some of whom were 10 points behind them. 
</P>
<P>
The top 24 point-makers from the first three days' play qualified for today's 
final round. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, all scores revert to zero, so the 54-hole lead was meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring in the event is a modified Stableford system in which points are 
awarded for the players' performance on each hole: 5 for eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 
for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or higher. 
</P>
<P>
It took a score of 16 points or better for three rounds to make it to the final 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, the defending champion, made a pair of double-bogeys -- he picked up on 
one of them, but a double-bogey is the highest score possible under this format 
-- and finished with a minus-1 score for the day and a total of two points. 
Nicklaus gained only two points in a round that required 73 strokes and 
finished with a total of five. 
</P>
<P>
Olazabal, 24, one of the brightest young stars on the European tour with a pair 
of victories this year, advanced to a share of the lead with a four-iron second 
shot that set up a 12-foot eagle putt on the 17th. He had a medal score of 69. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, 35, also plays most of his golf on the European circuit. He had the 
lead alone until he missed the green and bogeyed the final hole, finishing with 
a medal score of 70. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King had six birdies on the back nine to shoot a course-record 63 at the 
JAL Big Apple Classic at New Rochelle, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
King, who before the round said "maybe I can bring this course to its knees," 
moved to a three-round total of 11-under 205 at the Wykagyl Country Club and 
took a three-shot lead over Beth Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time U.S. Open champion, King bettered the mark of 65 set by Nancy Lopez 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
King the LPGA's player of the year in 1989, tied her single-round best, 
established two years ago at the Rail Charity Classic in Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Tammie Green, atop the leader board for the first two rounds, shot a 75 for 
212, and is tied for fourth with Dawn Coe. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel, after two consecutive 70s, had a 68 and moved into second at 208. 
Rosie Jones was third with a 71 for 209. 
</P>
<P>
Don Bies shot his second consecutive 66 at Jeremy Ranch Golf Course for a 
36-hole total of 12-under-par 132 and a two-stroke lead in the Senior Showdown 
Classic at Park City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hill, with a 68, moved into a tie for second with Rives McBee, who had a 
70. They are each at 134. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino and George Archer each shot 68 and share fourth place at 135.

If Jack Nicklaus seemed distracted during the International tournament, he had 
good reason. 
</P>
<P>
His son Gary is hospitalized at Swedish Medical Center in suburban Denver for 
treatment of a virus of the heart that left him in a semi-coma Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Nicklaus, 21, was in good condition Saturday night, according to a nursing 
supervisor. He was expected to be released as soon as tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus failed to qualify for today's final round of the International. 
He acknowledged that after his third round on Saturday, leaving the tournament 
was not uppermost in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more concerned about my son," Nicklaus said. "At first they thought he had 
suffered a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Nicklaus was stricken Wednesday and was confined briefly to the hospital's 
intensive care unit. His mother, Barbara, has been with him. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Nicklaus had been expected to compete in the U.S. Amateur, which 
begins Tuesday at nearby Cherry Hills Country Club.

THE KOMPANII THEY KEPT; 
</P>
<P>
THE THAW GENERATION COMING OF AGE IN THE POST-STALIN ERA BY LUDMILLA ALEXEYEVA 
AND PAUL GOLDBERG (LITTLE, BROWN: $18.95; 344 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-316-03146-1) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jane A. Taubman, Taubman, professor of Russian at Amherst College, is the 
author of A Life Through Poetry: Marina Tsvetaeva's Lyric Diary (Slavica) and 
co-author of Moscow Spring (Summit). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now, almost everything they fought for has been granted by the reformist 
hands of Gorbachev &amp; Co. In their own country, their names and feats of 
self-sacrifice are nearly unknown to a whole new generation. Meanwhile, the 
Soviet dissidents whose story is told in this book have faded into oblivion in 
the West, where many now live in emigration. But Ludmilla Alexeyeva, one of the 
founders of the Soviet human-rights movement, is philosophical: "We take no 
offense at Gorbachev and his associates for not citing us as sources. We are 
happy that our ideas have acquired a new life." 
</P>
<P>
Alexeyeva has previously written a detailed history of the Soviet dissident 
movement ("Soviet Dissent: Contemporary Movements for National, Religious and 
Human Rights," Wesleyan University Press, 1985), but in this engaging book, she 
has joined with journalist Paul Goldberg to produce a more personal account of 
her generation's political awakening and gradual move to dissidence. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1927, Alexeyeva was nearly 30, a graduate of Moscow University and the 
mother of two sons when Khrushchev made his secret speech unmasking Stalin in 
1956. Like many others in what was to become the human-rights movement, she 
came from a relatively privileged Soviet background. Her father, a devoted 
Komsomol (Communist youth league) member, rose from poverty to become a 
bureaucrat, and in the peak purge year of 1937, the family moved into a 
comfortable apartment house that was rapidly being vacated by the purges. The 
father himself barely escaped arrest, only to be killed in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Alexeyeva remembers her childhood as relatively happy, and, full of 
optimism, she entered the history department of Moscow University in its first 
postwar class. Initially, nearly all of her classmates were female, but they 
were soon joined by frontoviki, war veterans with little previous schooling but 
lots of patriotism, who were admitted outside the entrance competition. 
Unprepared for even the minimal intellectual demands of the purge-ridden 
university, they soon learned that a career could be built of loyalty and 
slogan-mongering. Alexeyeva and her friends faced two choices: opt out of 
political activity entirely, leaving the careerists in control, or join the 
party and try to reform it from within. At first, Alexeyeva chose the latter 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Alexeyeva's crowd got their real education in kompanii, informal evening talk 
fests cum historical consciousness-raising sessions that suddenly emerged in 
the mid-'50s, when the fear of informers subsided. In the kompanii, "old 
politizeki (political prisoners) would be shouting something at young 
philologists, middle-aged physicists would be locked in hot debates with young 
poets, and some people I had never met would be doing unrecognizable dance 
steps to someone's scratched Glenn Miller record." 
</P>
<P>
One of the more eccentric characters who frequented the kompanii was Aleksandr 
Esenin-Volpin, son of the poet, Sergei Esenin, who had a crazy idea: What would 
happen if Soviet citizens acted on the assumption that they had rights? And 
what if trials, in accordance with the Soviet constitution, were held openly, 
under conditions of glasnost -- a word that had been around long before even 
Esenin-Volpin? 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Alexeyeva's friend, Yuli Daniel, and his friend, Andrei Sinyavsky, 
were arrested and charged with publishing stories abroad under pseudonyms. 
Their trial was the watershed event for the thaw generation. It was the signal 
from the new Brezhnev regime that the heady, if inconsistent, era of limited 
intellectual freedom under Khrushchev had come to an end, and it became the 
test case for Esenin-Volpin's theories. 
</P>
<P>
By now established professionals in their 40s or older, the kompanii 
intellectuals supported Sinyavsky and Daniel by trying to gain access to the 
courtroom, or by signing letters of protest. The defendants themselves broke 
tradition by denying their guilt. And in the crowds outside the courtroom, the 
intellectuals began to forge their first contacts with Western journalists. 
With a smuggled tape recorder, they compiled a transcript of the Kafkaesque 
trial and published it abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In the camps, Sinyavsky and Daniel met other "politicals," particularly from 
national minority movements, whose names and struggles had been unknown to the 
Muscovites. Political links grew out of a support network of prisoners' wives, 
and the samizdat Chronicle of Current Events began to appear, publicizing 
political repressions all across the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The regime took its revenge. One by one, those who had dared to sign protest 
petitions, the so-called podpisanty, were forced to make decisions: recant, 
desist, and keep their jobs, or move to open dissidence. The majority took the 
first route; among them are many of perestroika's most active supporters, 
looking for one last chance to redeem themselves. By the time Czechoslovakia 
was invaded in August of 1968, only nine brave souls, including Larissa Bogoraz 
and Pavel Litvinov, dared to protest on Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
What is new in the book are not the familiar stories of heroism but rather the 
texture of the lives behind them, the personal stories those in the movement 
were not willing -- or able -- to tell while they were still political actors 
and martyrs. The changes in the Soviet Union have given the Western reader a 
wave of inside accounts never before have imagined, from the autobiographies of 
Boris Yeltsin and Andrei Sakharov to Sergei Khrushchev's memoir of his father. 
</P>
<P>
All these books remind us that the Russian tradition of "frankness" falls far 
short of the sensational personal revelations that American readers of 
autobiography have come to expect; and Goldberg has gotten Alexeyeva to let her 
hair down only a little. While she is reasonably straightforward in recounting 
the breakup of her own first marriage, Bogoraz's divorce from Daniel and 
marriage to Anatoly Marchenko, to take one example, are treated only in 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
Without being intentionally feminist, Alexeyeva gives us new insight into the 
important role women played in the democratic movement, a movement that grew up 
in kitchens and around dining tables. Women may have suffered fewer prison 
terms, but they were the ones who retyped samizdat and the Chronicle, extending 
the social networks that produced the kompanii in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Alexeyeva often compares her generation to the Decembrists, that small band of 
aristocratic Russian officers who returned from Paris after the defeat of 
Napoleon, bringing Western democratic ideas. In 1825, they staged a brave but 
hopeless attempt at a coup on the Senate square in Saint Petersburg. 
Alexeyeva's crowd, too, was an elite band of idealists trying to infect what 
they regarded as the inert Russian mass with liberal ideas. 
</P>
<P>
They saw their underground journals as the equivalent of Alexander Herzen's 
emigre magazine, the Bell. But the very same regime that celebrated Herzen and 
the Decembrists as its revolutionary forbears in the struggle against czarist 
tyranny was even harsher than the czar in repressing those forbears' true 
descendants. 
</P>
<P>
Though the dissident movement was all but destroyed by the early '80s, 
Alexeyeva convincingly argues its importance in making today's reforms 
possible: "Westernizers, nonexistent at the time of my birth, have now become a 
formidable political force. Now, like the Decembrists a century before us, we 
have been given the reward of knowing that the country has responded to our cry 
for the rule of law."

OF CHILES, CACTI, AND FIGHTING COCKS NOTES ON THE AMERICAN WEST BY FREDERICK 
TURNER (BERKLEY/NORTH POINT PRESS: $19.95; 211 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Jordan-Smith, Jordan-Smith is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were several good reasons for reading this book, one of which, to anyone 
with a love of the spice of life, is paramount: a first-rate recipe for "Basic 
Texas Red" chili. As Frederick Turner points out in his chapter, "A Lot Like It 
Hot," one must be careful to distinguish between chile, which is the pepper, 
and chili, which is the dish you make from chiles; that, however, is the least 
of the informative tidbits about chiles and chili that can be found here. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, whose book "Spirit of Place," published earlier this year, touched but 
briefly on the American West, here turns his attention completely to the spirit 
and place of that expanse whose peculiarities, stark drama and absence of 
visible boundaries altered the consciousness of so many of its immigrants. 
Mustangs, saguaros, the lives of cowboys and Indians (at least as seen by white 
eyes), the Gargantuan proportions of the Czech beseda in Deming, the Horatio 
Alger rise of the Basque sheepherders, cockfighting, Billy the Kid: One cannot 
say: "It's all here," because the legends are endless, but this is as good a 
place as you are likely to find from which to begin a revisitation of the 
American West. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are changes from "the olden days." Government management (or 
mismanagement, which amounts to the same thing) has wrought ecological 
endangerment everywhere one cares to look. Nor has the situation been markedly 
improved by the well-meaning intervention of environmental groups, equally 
devoted to management though on terms somewhat different than those of the 
local ranchers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be too easy to devote an entire book to the disasters of a overly 
managed land; it would be too easy to ignore such things altogether also, and 
Turner does not skirt the issue in his essay on the plight of the mustangs. It 
is not an easy issue: The Bureau of Land Management was pretty clearly rendered 
absurd by the Reagan Administration, but the claims -- and worse, the methods 
-- of the environmentalist groups are equally open to criticism. The vast herds 
of wild horses that once roamed the West are severely diminished -- but were 
their huge numbers such a good thing for them? 
</P>
<P>
Government and special-interest groups are not the only instigators of change. 
Boosterism has sufficiently obscured enough of history to leave the story of 
Billy the Kid eternally ambiguous, and the American consciousness itself has 
suffered changes in the passage of time. The festival celebrating the Czech 
community in Deming, N.M. -- that has taken place for nearly 60 years -- may be 
seeing its last days as new generations lose interest in producing klobase, the 
Bohemian sausage of pork and beef that is the staple of the beseda. But the 
tourism that it inspires may be sufficient to keep the custom alive, though the 
intimacy of the earlier gatherings has long been forsaken. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Czechs, the Basques have witnessed change: The way of these remarkable 
sheepherders, who steadily extracted pasturage from the most unlikely places 
(such as the Great Basin of eastern Oregon), has eroded, but without much 
regret. That way was too lonely, too cut off from the mainstream to long 
survive. Yet there are some regrets: The decline of one way of life is seldom, 
if ever, isolated from the culture from which it sprang. When a generation 
begins to think in the language of its surrounding culture, the mind set of the 
mother tongue is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
Turner is at his best when writing about people, and his chapter, "Buying the 
West -- and Selling It: Two Versions," is clearly the best piece in the book. 
There he describes the quintessentially wild Western lives of two gifted 
adventurers: James Willard Schultz, who lived among the Blackfeet, marrying a 
Pikuni woman, and wrote "My Life as an Indian"; and the French-Canadian artist 
and writer Joseph-Ernest-Nephtali Dufault, who lived as a cowboy and was better 
known to us all as Will James, the author of "Smoky" and "Lone Cowboy." 
Schultz's and James' stories are as Western as sagebrush, and Turner serves 
them well with intimacy, simplicity and affection. Will James appears little 
known to younger generations, but to my own and that of my parents, his books 
and paintings made the Old West live. It is good to see him remembered so 
fondly. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's American vision is alive: We see through his words. He has found his 
voice, but it is still a question whether he has discovered what he needs to 
say with it. The West is a strongly delineated place in outward form, and this 
can sometimes produce a deceptive impression of depth in those who write about 
it. "Spirit of Place" was a fine book, and this is a good one too, but they are 
not the best that we could receive from Turner, given his abilities. A broad 
vision is not enough; it needs to go deeper. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, try the chili.

RICHARD EDER: MINIMALIST AT MID-LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
NATURAL SELECTION BY FREDERICK BARTHELME (VIKING: $18.95; 208 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our minimalist fiction writers, chroniclers of the young urban and suburban 
middle classes, use deflection to write of their fears and passions. Often 
ingeniously -- some of our best writers are minimalists -- they suggest the 
emotions by muting them: heat by coolness; outcry by silence. It is the silence 
of Sherlock Holmes' celebrated dog that does not bark. 
</P>
<P>
What would a minimalist dog sound like if it did bark? Frederick Barthelme, 
whose collection of short stories, "Moon Deluxe," was a nearly perfect 
minimalist work, has made a fascinating and often moving attempt to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"Natural Selection" is rich in the oblique ironies and the broken-field talking 
and thinking that we have come to expect of Barthelme, Ann Beattie, Mary 
Robison, the late Raymond Carver and so many others, but there is a rupture 
right down the middle. The skin of control is broken. Awkwardly -- Barthelme 
himself can be awkward attempting it -- his characters are turned to stare 
their anguish in the face instead of in smoked and angled mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen years ago, Peter and Lily were singles. They lived outside Houston in 
rented poolside apartments with shag rugs and flimsy plasterboard ceilings. 
They drove to malls and fern bars and went at 11 p.m. for waffles or beer. Now 
they are married, have good jobs, an 11-year-old son, Charles -- as knowing and 
rueful-witty as his parents -- and a suburban house. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tract house, with barbecue, garden shed and wood deck. But as Peter, 
the narrator, tells us: "The yard has worn patches you recognize. . . . And the 
deck looks as old as you are, you don't mind sitting on it." 
</P>
<P>
It is, right at the start, one of those seeded sentences that hint at the 
transition the book is set in, and the transformations that lie ahead. 
Minimalist couple glimpse middle-age, and beyond that, growing old and dying. 
</P>
<P>
There are no minimalist deaths; they are all the same size. The recognition and 
acceptance of time passing requires a wrenching alteration of the language we 
use for our lives. "Natural Selection" is about Peter's painful struggle to 
learn that alteration. 
</P>
<P>
The book takes place in Peter's early mid-life crisis, with excursions into the 
past when life and love were easily taken on, and disposed of. Peter is 
restless, bored, rebellious. Lily and Charles are too precious to be disposed 
of; realizing this, he realizes he cannot dispose of himself; he feels 
imprisoned and desperate. 
</P>
<P>
The desperation sways in a balance of acute detail and comedy that sometimes 
recalls Updike in his suburban period, and sometimes, when Peter's comic 
soliloquy goes wild, Peter De Vries. The narrator jokes blackly with Lily and 
Charles and they gamely joke back, but something serious is going on. 
</P>
<P>
The husband and father keeps up a litany of gallows-humor rant about the state 
of the world and the foolishnesses and conformities of American living. When a 
man does that, at some point his wife and child will get a different message: 
Are you angry at us? Fed up? Leaving? 
</P>
<P>
Peter, in fact, is on the borderline of a breakdown, signaled when his 
intellectual rough-and-tumble with Charles edges past joking into a moment or 
two of real cruelty. He is not a cruel man; he is a decent man riding on the 
edge of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He moves tentatively out of the house, returning every day. To have taken that 
bit of action clarifies things for him; he is freer to own attachment to his 
life and to his family. He moves back, not quite as tentatively as he moved 
out; he may be OK. And then life, perhaps fed up with being learned so tardily 
and for such low, easy tuition, takes a tragic swipe at him. 
</P>
<P>
It is tempting to spell out the tragedy. It would allow me to give an idea of 
the distance Barthelme is covering in his own evolution. I will only say that 
the last 20 pages of this brief but spacious book contain a tautly building 
horror, followed by a cry of despair and regret as powerful as it is 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
I have stressed theme and form at the expense of detail; if Barthelme is 
breaking his own new ground with the first two, he is on beautifully cultivated 
home ground with the last. 
</P>
<P>
Peter's and Lily's first date, in flashback, is a comical minimalist tour de 
force. Each pokes a tentative turtle head out of a protective shell; each says 
zingy things and apologizes for them. He suggests a movie: "I probably can't be 
boring in a movie." She hates people who say they're boring, she tells him, and 
soon she is floundering too. "I do this. I need a verbal skill. Just one. 
Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow they get to his apartment; she has cleverly arranged for each to take a 
car so it will work out. Somehow they not only have sex but, without quite 
admitting it, they make love. The moment of truth comes in the morning when she 
has carefully arranged breakfast and is self-conscious about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was delicious," he says. Turtle head retracts: Has he sounded patronizing? 
"I mean, I meant it was delicious but I didn't mean the other part -- you know 
what I'm talking about?" "The repellent part?" she asks. He knows they must 
grow old together. 
</P>
<P>
That is no ending, of course, but a beginning; and it is the battle to grow old 
that Peter is fighting with himself 10 years later. Barthelme's comedy of 
detail rarely wavers, but it goes deep until, without apparent transition, we 
are touched. 
</P>
<P>
He manages to suggest, subtly but without deflections, the pain that Peter's 
life-crisis is causing. His portrait of the 10-year-old Charles gamely trying 
to play along with his father's moods while keeping his own independence are 
funny and moving. Even more remarkable is what he does with Lily. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderfully well-voiced, she is fighting not altogether consciously to bring 
Peter into life. She will try anything: irony, sympathy, argument. She will 
even become him; at one point, she takes up his angry commentary on the state 
of the world and out-despairs him. 
</P>
<P>
She will even dream for him; it is one of the best fictional dreams in a long 
time. It is a gathering of philosophers who argue by changing their pants. One 
dons a green pair; another studies it, reflects, and counters by putting on 
plaid. It is a rejoinder to Peter's despairing vision of entropy. Lily's 
vision: "The possibility of good fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Not quite everything works. The last 20 pages are breathtaking, but it is not 
quite the same breath we have been breathing up to then. Thematically, the 
shift is justified, but fictionally, though not unprepared, it makes the gears 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
The main difficulty occurs, now and then, with Peter. His reflections about the 
state of the world and his own state represent, of course, the minimalist's 
breakthrough. He is confronting, not evading. But these soliloquies are 
exceedingly rounded and complete. They can suggest Layman's Sunday in church. 
The sermon, worked on so hard, is more brilliant than the minister's own 
average effort, but it fights the occasion a little. 
</P>
<P>
Barthelme's battle with his own literary occasion has these roughnesses. No 
battle is ever tidy. Some, such as this one, are supremely worthwhile.

THE DREAMS OF DAEDALUS; 
</P>
<P>
THE FULLNESS OF WINGS THE MAKING OF A NEW DAEDALUS BY GARY DORSEY (VIKING: 
$19.95; 342 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-607-82444-5) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bart Everett, Everett is an assistant Times systems editor and a commercial 
pilot. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 24, 1988, a Greek athlete pedaled a super-lightweight airplane 70 
miles across the Aegean Sea from Crete to Santorini in the longest 
human-powered flight in history. The fragile craft disintegrated at its 
destination and, similarly, the crew that launched it scattered like broken 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Dorsey reconstructs both for us in a narrative remarkable for its insights 
as well as its omissions. 
</P>
<P>
The builders of the Daedalus airplane produced a legacy of science and 
technology, of art and craftsmanship, of human physiology and endurance. 
Inevitably, someone else will do even more with even less, will fly farther or 
faster or higher. But that is not the focus here. This is not a book about 
flying or science or athletics. 
</P>
<P>
This is about discovery and motivation, human stuff: how a group of students 
and engineers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology were gradually and 
inexorably drawn into a project that would assume proportions greater than the 
sum of its participants. 
</P>
<P>
John Langford, the project leader, is in his senior year at MIT when he 
overhears a telephone conversation about an airplane that nobody wants. It was 
designed for human-powered flight but would not fly. While "John thought the 
notion of human-powered flight was particularly insipid," Dorsey writes, he 
wanted the plane for his rocket club to fly as a model. Langford and his 
buddies would use real engines to power it. 
</P>
<P>
And so they did, but still the stubborn BURD (Biplane Ultralight Research 
Device) would not fly. What a waste of time! The BURD had been built as a 
laboratory project at MIT, and the rocket club found it terribly flawed. It was 
all science and no engineering, a kludge, they called it. 
</P>
<P>
This was nature's gauntlet thrown down, a challenge that led Langford and his 
friends headlong into the human-powered flight business. But it was more than a 
challenge of physics; it was a competition with authority. Scholars had 
designed this failure, but pure engineering could triumph over scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, another ultra-light-aircraft pioneer, Paul MacCready, had yet to 
capture the Kremer Prize for crossing the English Channel with his Gossamer 
Albatross. Langford propositioned MIT for $2,500 to build "the first in a 
series of crafts," which might attempt the channel crossing and win the prize. 
</P>
<P>
Langford and his friends, while not planning for an immediate channel crossing, 
nevertheless built a successful airplane and proved their engineering point. 
But that was only the beginning for the MIT group. Although MacCready crossed 
the channel first, MIT later beat out MacCready in another Kremer competition. 
The inference drawn from Dorsey's account, however, is that prizes were 
secondary. There was something more basic at work here. 
</P>
<P>
After their initial success, Langford and his friends took legitimate jobs in 
the aerospace industry. After all, they'd finished at a prestigious school and 
were expected to pursue prestigious careers at prestigious companies. But they 
could not; they were drawn back to earlier dreams, a more creative environment. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is but prologue to the Daedalus project, whose aim was to re-create 
-- or rewrite -- the myth of Daedalus and his son Icarus fleeing a labyrinth 
prison, borne on fragile wings over the Aegean. 
</P>
<P>
As the Daedalus team works toward its goal, Dorsey's report becomes laden with 
conflict. There were doubts, worries, petty jealousies, nervous encounters with 
the press, failures, crashes. The story bogs down here but gains credibility. 
This does not have the scent of an "authorized" report. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to Crete, the anxious wait for perfect weather and the conflicts that 
mount as time runs short -- these amount to an epilogue of endeavor rooted in 
children's fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey's work is valuable for its insight into the personalities involved. 
There is a good deal of biography here -- what these adult engineers and 
scientists did as children and college students, what excited them, what 
inspired them. Dorsey is a journalist, and this is good reporting. We see how 
the players are drawn into the project; we see pride at work, ingenuity, 
determination, skill, teamwork, patience, love, strife. 
</P>
<P>
Langford is portrayed at first as an eager understudy of his slightly elder 
peers and later as a relentless taskmaster who alienated his best friends. But 
most of all, he and his colleagues are seen as dreamers. 
</P>
<P>
In an afterword, Langford writes, "it was a disappointment to come of age in a 
time when Jimmy Carter specifically offered 'no new dreams' in his inaugural, 
and when the inspiration offered by Ronald Reagan was to 'just say no.' The 
development of the Daedalus project probably drew at least part of its energy 
from this disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Part of its energy, maybe. Dorsey calls the Daedalus crew "renegades" and 
"radicals" attached to a nucleus of MIT rocket buffs and model builders, also 
renegades and radicals. Clearly these are terms of admiration, but Dorsey falls 
short of revealing the difference between the dreams of children and of adult 
"renegades." 
</P>
<P>
The only ones capable of a true understanding of this kind of dreaming may be 
the dreamers themselves. But there are hints here, and therein lies the charm 
of this tale. 
</P>
<P>
One can't help but wish, though, that MacCready had been given equal -- or at 
least better -- billing. His was a different kind of team in a different 
setting. But he was a winner in the same game and no doubt a powerful dreamer 
of the same, mysterious ilk.

STORYTELLERS: NEW IN SEPTEMBER

By GEORGIA JONES-DAVIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Bond aside, the British take their spies very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations concerning Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony 
Blunt did more than dominate London headlines in the 1950s and 1960s. The 
defections to Moscow of these double agents who rose out of the privileged 
classes rocked the British imagination. John le Carre based some of "Tinker 
Tailor Soldier Spy" on the story of Kim Philby. The film, "Another Country," 
examined how it was that staunchly English institutions such as the public 
school (and Cambridge) could nurture future double agents for the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Spy fiction coming out of the United Kingdom has a grim, urgent edge to it that 
reflects the British sense of having been at the front lines in the Cold War. 
Brits have always seen themselves as a step ahead of the noisy, Commie-bashing 
Americans in the age-old war with the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, glasnost and the collapse of the Communist regimes in East Germany 
and Eastern Europe have actually dated most recent spy fiction, whether 
American or British. 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to Len Deighton, then, to come in right under the wire. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Le Carre (or alongside, if you will), Deighton has been a master of 
British spy fiction since he published "Funeral in Berlin" and "The Ipcress 
File." 
</P>
<P>
His newest novel, Spy Sinker (Harper &amp; Row: $19.95; 352 pp., 250,000-copy 
first printing), is the final volume in a trilogy, preceded by "Spy Hook" and 
"Spy Line." Deighton promises that each of these three novels concerning the 
Bernard Samson story may be read in any order and that each functions 
independently of the other. 
</P>
<P>
In "Spy Sinker" Deighton tells the story of how British Intelligence, back in 
the late '70s, wants to plant a double agent in East Germany whose mission will 
be to start the machinery for the dismantling of the Wall in 1988. Fiona 
Samson, a career spy and wife of intelligence officer Bernard Samson, is picked 
for the job. She is to defect and her husband is not to know that her defection 
is entirely staged. It will appear that this glamorous lady has simply left 
behind husband, children (and hairdresser), a nice London flat, maybe a Jag, 
and moved by choice to dreary, dull East Berlin out of pure desire to serve the 
Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
I was completedly fascinated by the idea that it was the British behind the 
recent changes in Germany -- infiltrating religious groups, undermining the 
economy, generating the unrest that lead to the recent demonstrations by the 
rosy-cheeked Junge Ostberliner, all leading to the bringing down of the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
We learn just a little about Bernard and Fiona's less-than-cozy marriage. We 
wait anxiously, along with Fiona, for the orders to go East. We want to see her 
get out of the assignment. But her superior, Bret Rensselaer, refuses to take 
her personal needs into account. He browbeats her into accepting the next to 
impossible task of defecting for her country. 
</P>
<P>
The novel quietly builds to the point where the British must spring Fiona out 
of the East. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Fiona's sister Tessa in Berlin at the crucial time? Who is the guy in 
the gorilla suit? Why does Deighton introduce the subplot about Rensselaer's 
wife leaving him? What went on during that meeting between Fiona and Bernard 
that London Central didn't know about? 
</P>
<P>
I missed that crucial scene in "Spy Sinker" -- when the long separated husband 
and wife finally meet face to face. Will I find it in "Spy Hook" or "Spy Line"? 
Fiona's story takes center stage here, thus putting Bernard's into the 
background. His version of events is picked up in other Deighton novels. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands on its own, "Spy Sinker" is a cold, spare tale of a woman we never 
get close to. Fiona and Bernard remain particularly bureaucratic and faceless. 
Their bosses, in contrast -- American Anglophile Bret Rensselaer, and the 
agency director Sir Henry Clevemore -- come across as lively and utterly 
ruthless, no less so than any KGB operative. 
</P>
<P>
Deighton hooks you, though. I'm curious to read more about Bernard and Fiona in 
his other books to round their story. I also want to find out more about their 
boss Bret, why he's given up spying for living the easy life in Ventura, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tryon's new novel, The Wings of Morning (Alfred A. Knopf: $22.95; 568 
pp.) is about as removed in time and spirit from Southern California as you can 
imagine. We're back in small-town 19th-Century New England. And I thought East 
Berlin was dull. 
</P>
<P>
Tryon, the author of such best-sellers as "The Other" and "Harvest Home," has 
written an oddly archaic book. Tryon has carefully constructed an outsized 
Victorian- style story complete with level-headed heroine and uplifting moral 
message. Even the titles in the Contents sound as if they should be inscribed 
on parchment: "The Stag at Morn"; "The Miller Makes Ado"; "When Lilies Bloomed 
in the Snow." 
</P>
<P>
Georgie Ross is the daughter of a poor miller in an agrarian New England 
village. Two local, affluent families, the Grimeses and the Talcotts, carry on 
a multigenerational feud. Georgie is buddies with the young scion, "Sinjin" 
Grimes, while at the same time she works as a domestic for the Talcotts and 
their numerous daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The plot opens like a New England version of "Romeo and Juliet": Sinjin meets 
the beautiful but empty-headed Aurora Talcott the day the town is preparing to 
welcome President John Quincy Adams. Georgie plays the role of go-between, 
which leads to no good. She loses her job, Aurora ups and marries an English 
aristocrat and Sinjin sails off to China on the ship that his grandmother gives 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Georgie is the most plucky, rational (read boring) heroine to come down the 
pike since Agnes in "David Copperfield." Endurance is this girl's middle name. 
She says to her father, a villain and creep if there ever was one: "Life's not 
sad, at least it oughtn't to be. It should be happy and joyous." 
</P>
<P>
This from a girl whom nobody ever comes round to court. (She may be no beauty, 
but you get the idea she's a comely lass.) She briefly entertains romantic 
notions about Sinjin, an immature 19-year-old with a Byron complex, but quickly 
sees the silliness in it. She's hired as local teacher but then soon is fired 
for teaching "far too much Byron." She is reduced to working as a serving girl 
in a public house, but turns that grinding job into a cheerful and honorable 
existence. She's offered a chance to travel to Italy but turns it down, 
preferring to remain in this backwater community. Does she have any idea what 
she's doing to the reader? 
</P>
<P>
Georgie carries on, always rational, always seeing everything in its proper 
perspective. So much so that it starts to drive you crazy. You want her to fall 
madly in love, have a temper tantrum, anything. 
</P>
<P>
Georgie's dog is killed in a dog fight and a violent tragedy strikes her family 
(it is a horrible thing that happens, yet the only riveting event in this 
entire novel). Only then does she humanly respond to the grimness around her: 
"And all was kept within her, the pain and horror she took into herself and 
kept close, as though to make friends of them." 
</P>
<P>
Tryon has built a terribly thin story on a massive scale. The real problem here 
isn't Tryon's ability to tell a tale, but his choice of characters. Sinjin, 
Aurora and Georgie are too immature to be interesting and to have anything to 
talk about. They're just teen-agers, not exactly the most evolved species on 
the planet. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes Tryon is hilarious without intending to be: " 'Having shuffled 
off this mortal coil, old Percy's in a far better way than I am.' As he always 
did when alluding to the romantic Shelley, Sinjin spoke feelingly of the poet's 
tragic death." 
</P>
<P>
If you go for pages of party preparations and discussions about hat design, 
lots of empty chitchat and bad poetry quoted at length, this book is for you. 
</P>
<P>
Tryon's choice of information to share borders on the sexist. He gives us 
details about the Grimes' bad taste in home decorating: "A pineapple motif . . 
. badly faded." At the same time he throws in some intriguing tidbits about the 
political rivalry of John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. He even gives his 
feuding characters political opinions. But he never elaborates on any of these 
references. Could he believe that the distaff side of things simply precludes 
an interest in history and politics? 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, both politics and interior decorating take a definite back 
seat in the new Sidney Sheldon novel, Memories of Midnight (William Morrow: 
$21.95; 399 pp.). Financial wheeling and dealing and hired killers are the 
stuff of this somewhat bland sequel to "The Other Side of Midnight," the highly 
likable story of the doomed beautiful gamine Noelle Paige and her evil Greek 
lover, Constantin Demiris. 
</P>
<P>
Guys don't come much worse than Demiris. He has to have more money than anybody 
else. He has to have any woman he fancies. He hires people to kill whoever gets 
in his way or makes him look like a jerk. He lives for revenge the way I live 
for a vacation in the south of France. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of "The Other Side of Midnight," Demiris had his mistress Noelle and 
her American lover Larry executed, even though they were actually innocent of 
killing Larry's wife Catherine. It is a year later in "Memories" when we meet 
Catherine, just emerging from amnesia. Demiris has counted on the American 
woman never regaining her memory, since he's made sure the world (or most of 
it) thinks she is dead. 
</P>
<P>
So Demiris decides Catherine must die, but first, like a cat, he'll have his 
fun with her. 
</P>
<P>
A major weakness in Sheldon's story is that we are expected to believe that 
Catherine has no distant relative, no friend, besides her ex-boss, that she'd 
want to contact to tell she's alive. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is uninspired, even cartoony, and somewhat predictable. I knew there 
had to be a point in mentioning a boiler in the basement of Catherine's London 
office, and a reason for Wim, the idiot savant, to be present. There are no 
accidents, no wasted references in Sheldon's world. Still, he does manage a 
couple of neat surprises. 
</P>
<P>
And as for sex, Sheldon gets right to it on the third page when Demiris visits 
The Blue House in Hong Kong, a "cornucopia of forbidden pleasures," where he 
orders twins. Sheldon certainly had me curious, for the rest of the novel, 
about what exactly is the "tenth century art of Ishinpo"? 
</P>
<P>
Anyone have an idea? I'd hate for a creep like Demiris to be able to take a 
secret like that to his grave.

CLOAKED IN HER OWN SECRECY; 
</P>
<P>
CHANEL A WOMAN OF HER OWN BY AXEL MADSEN (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 364 PP.; 
0-8050-0961-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rose-Marie Turk, Turk is a fashion writer for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few fashion designers have left a legacy as permanent, as rich or as imitated 
as that of Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel. Her creations -- exquisite little black 
dresses, collarless jackets trimmed with gold buttons and braid, black-tipped 
spectator pumps, quilted handbags, the understated floral notes of Chanel No. 5 
-- remain benchmarks of superb, elegant taste. 
</P>
<P>
Dark, thin, pretty Gabrielle Chanel rose from nowhere to become the reigning 
priestess of streamlined high-fashion for almost 60 years. 329) But for all her 
fame and fortune, her string of impressive lovers and her powerful influence on 
style, she died a lonely woman -- determined to take to the grave as much of 
her story as she could. 
</P>
<P>
"She made up things," Axel Madsen says immediately. "She reinvented her 
childhood. . . . After she became rich, she paid off her brothers to pretend 
they didn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, she was ashamed of her initial poverty and the fact that her 
parents, itinerant market peddlers, were unmarried when she was born. During 
her life she would claim she was raised by old-maid aunts. But in reality, 
after her mother died and her father disappeared, 12-year-old Chanel and her 
two sisters were placed in an orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
When she was 21, working as a seamstress and residing in the military town of 
Moulins, Chanel met Etienne Balsan, a rich bachelor with a passion for 
racehorses. She spent six years as mistress of his estate, Royallieu, where she 
learned to ride, to mix with society and to set herself apart. Instead of 
wearing ready-made millinery, she bought straw boaters, intended for 
schoolboys, and trimmed them with ribbons and lace. Soon she was making hats 
for other women in her circle. 
</P>
<P>
At Royallieu, she was introduced to Arthur (Boy) Capel, a wealthy Englishman 
who became the love of her life. After they ran off to Paris together, Chanel 
opened the millinery shop of her dreams -- thanks to Balsan (a truly good 
sport), who lent her an apartment for the venture, and to Capel, who helped 
finance it. 
</P>
<P>
Next came a boutique on Rue Cambon, the street where Chanel Inc. can be found 
today, followed by another in Deauville. There, Madsen says, "she invented 
sports clothes" and became the first designer to turn wool jersey -- considered 
too lifeless for anything but underwear -- into chic sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Step by step, her professional life soared. But long-lasting love eluded her. 
(She would always maintain she had never wanted to marry and lose her 
independence.) Boy Capel wed an English aristocrat and died in an automobile 
accident while in France and planning to see Chanel one more time. The Duke of 
Westminster, her lover for 10 years, also left her for an English aristocrat -- 
one who could bear him a child, which Chanel could not. Her friends gossiped 
that she would marry Paul Iribe, but the artist and set designer collapsed and 
died on her tennis court in the middle of a game. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel's whole life was a tough game of chance in which she won more often than 
she lost. For years, the deal she struck with Pierre and Paul Wertheimer for 
Chanel No. 5 was the bane of her existence, but it eventually proved a godsend: 
The Wertheimers bankrolled her return to fashion in 1954 after a 15-year 
absence. The French spurned the collection, calling it passe, but when it 
received rave reviews in America, Chanel's career was reborn. Even her alleged 
collaboration with the Nazis during World War II was swept under the carpet 
because she supposedly knew too many British secrets to go on trial. Her 
suspected collaboration was tied to a wartime romance with German diplomat Hans 
Gunther von Dincklage ("Spatz" to his friends) and her insistance on living at 
the Ritz Hotel along with the occupying Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Her escapades and her pals -- such as Colette, Cocteau, Diaghilev and 
Stravinsky -- were never short on glamour and intrigue. Yet Madsen paints a 
dull, confusing picture. On page after page, the reader finds little more than 
a jumbled band of colorless stick figures, borrowed heavily from previous 
biographers, such as Paul Morand. 
</P>
<P>
If, as Madsen often repeats, Chanel was determined to remain a mystery; if she 
sent away in abject confusion even those to whom she chose to tell some of her 
story, why does he try his hand nearly 20 years after her death? With nothing 
fresh to contribute, he has woven an awkward, ill-fitting tale of a woman who 
devoted her life to magnificently constructed garments -- and to secrecy.

"Coco, the Novel" is a good argument against dying. 
</P>
<P>
With death -- in this case, fashion icon Coco Chanel's -- a private life enters 
the public domain, free to become the stuff that novels are made of. And not 
necessarily great novels -- novels that take the events of a lifetime, compress 
them, reshape them and serve them anew with a few interpretive social 
flavorings. 
</P>
<P>
Who was Coco Chanel? As portrayed "Coco: The Novel" she was a veritable 
superwoman: a workaholic, a natural horsewoman, a crack shot and a raven-haired 
beauty with boundless ambition and the determination never to be possessed by a 
man. She had a designing eye for the simple, yet her life was far from 
uncomplicated. She was lucky at gaming tables but, for the most part, unlucky 
at love. The perfect stuff of novels. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia B. Soliman presents her fictional portrait of Coco, from age 17 to her 
death, through narration in Coco's voice and the voices of her confidants and 
lovers. Alas, one failing of the book is that the voices have little to 
distinguish them. Each new voice introduces itself with a little personal 
history, then launches into a "the first time I saw Coco" reverie. It makes for 
slow going in the early chapters. 
</P>
<P>
The book jacket explains that Soliman, an editor for two decades, now has 
switched literary hats. She knows the tricks of the literary craft. It's all 
technically correct, but it lacks inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
After failing in her ambition to become a star of the stage, our little 
dark-haired Gabrielle evolves into Coco and eases into dressmaking, millinery 
and a love affair with a rich man. That affair is followed by another love 
affair with another rich man. Unfortunately, due to the compression of events, 
all this and World War I go by in the blink of an eye. Somewhere in the midst 
of all this, chere petite Coco opens her couture business in Paris (with a 
little help from her the second rich lover, Boy Capel), expands to Deauville, 
liberates women from corsets and raises hemlines to ankle-baring heights. Mon 
dieu! 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, the novel manages to suggest passion. A few of the scenes summon 
up the romantic intensity of an earnest bodice-ripper. One imaginative scene 
creates a metaphor between lovemaking and Coco's penchant for pearls (and 
that's all I can say in a family newspaper). 
</P>
<P>
The later chapters have more vitality. Perhaps by then Soliman had a greater 
familiarity with her characters; perhaps the terrain felt less foreign. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Coco is running with the rich and the famous and the notorious 
and the artsy. The name-dropping gets serious: Picasso, Cocteau, Diaghilev, 
Stravinsky, Winston Churchill. After pages of events and openings and balls and 
what-nots, we find ourselves with a mature Coco of 37. Suddenly, in middle life 
after years of liaisons, Coco is concerned with her fertility. Is that the old 
ticktock of the biological clock we hear? 
</P>
<P>
Still, her life seems a little too effortless. (Yeah, I know Coco was lonely 
and suffered from insomnia, but she also had a seemingly endless string of 
lovers and lots of money.) Soliman's idea, no doubt, is that Coco was an 
original -- that she just was. But if I'm going to buy a hardcover and spend 
the time it takes to read nearly 400 pages, I want to have an understanding or 
at least a good guess -- as to who or what the woman was. 
</P>
<P>
What we get instead is a woman allegedly fiercely driven to independence but 
who just couldn't stop attracting men (and a few women) who wanted to possess 
her. For all her independence, our Coco was a prisoner of love. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Soliman chose a Chanel quote to set the book's tone: "Great loves, 
too, must be endured." The same could be said for portions of this novel. 
</P>
<P>
So, chers amis, if you are curious about Coco Chanel the person, pick up a 
biography. If, however, you're interested in the more romanticized version, 
this is the book for you. It's suitable for pool-side or airplane reading. 
Only, wait for the paperback.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: AMERICAN JOURNALS BY ALBERT CAMUS TRANSLATED BY HUGH LEVICK

<P>
The notebooks that Albert Camus kept on his lecture tours of the United States 
in 1946 and South America in 1949 contain some fascinating impressions from one 
of the most significant novelists of the postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
Camus saw America as a country where "everything is done to prove that life 
isn't tragic," where people are generous and hospitable "without affection" and 
where "everyone looks like they've stepped out of a B-film." His descriptions 
of the miasmal heat and the juxtaposition of luxury and squalor in Brazil would 
be integrated into his later works, especially "The Plague." Hugh Levick's 
translations capture the author's spare, incisive style.

AGNES DE MILLE EN POINTE; 
</P>
<P>
PORTRAIT GALLERY BY AGNES DE MILLE (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 305 PP.; 
0-395-52809-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donna Perlmutter, Perlmutter is the author of the first biography of 
choreographer Antony Tudor, to be published by Viking-Penguin next spring. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At PBS they titled her recent TV documentary "Agnes, the Indomitable de Mille" 
-- a supreme case of truth in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The feisty iconoclast who elbowed her way into the rarefied, male-dominated 
society of ballet choreographers four decades ago helped revolutionize the 
Broadway musical by integrating story into dance, and held forth in her art 
form as social commentator nonpareil, even beat back the adversity of a stroke 
suffered in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Any ordinary mortal might have lacked the courage or determination to relearn 
speech and movement, as she did, but the niece of Cecil B. De Mille was always 
a fighter, an outspoken and irreverent one at that. Happily, little has changed 
for the octogenarian in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
A pioneer in American dance, she went on to chronicle her recovery in a book 
("Reprieve") and followed one amazing feat with another. From a wheelchair, De 
Mille created "The Informer," a major new work for the 1988 season of American 
Ballet Theatre -- the company she had endowed early on with such national 
classics as "Rodeo" and "Fall River Legend." 
</P>
<P>
Now, crippled with arthritis and nearly bedfast, the indomitable one still has 
something more to herald: this, her 12th book. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait Gallery," a collection of monographs, is about celebrated figures De 
Mille has known, as well as noted family members. With the keenest appreciation 
of Isadora Duncan, for instance, and a palpable dislike for Sol Hurok, her most 
incisive profile of the lot, the writer offers lively, literate glimpses into 
the world of dance and show business. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly she dotes on her own encounters with these subjects, using the same 
autobiographical style as before. Otherwise, she lends the occasional 
perspective from afar, capturing the particular dancer's poetic essence, but 
more often, and sometimes unfairly, puncturing any myth of benevolence that 
person may have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
There were three figures, she admits, who positively astonished her: Antony 
Tudor, Sybil Shearer and Carmelita Maracci. Only the first (about whom she has 
written in previous books and thus omits here) is widely known among dance 
audiences; for whatever reason, she doesn't deliver an entry on the second. But 
her account of the late Maracci, easily the most extraordinary dancer to 
languish in oblivion, is fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
She relies on her diary of half a century ago for the exquisitely detailed 
descriptions of this phenomenal concert dancer-turned-teacher-turned-recluse, 
but perhaps because of their love-hate relationship and De Mille's likely envy 
of Maracci's gifts, she fails to put her in historical view. 
</P>
<P>
The two became friends in Los Angeles during the late 1930s when De Mille 
attended Maracci's ballet classes, which were that rare thing: a true art form, 
as opposed to a regimental skill. Her vignette of Carmelita in the studio -- 
winking at the regulars while a flabbergasted visitor, Anton Dolin, watched 
Maracci knock off a smart series of entrechats six interspersed with entrechats 
huit -- is choice. It also provokes frustration in the reader who never saw 
such marvels firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
However, her explanations of this complex person fall short. She notes that 
"Carmie" destroyed what promised to be a monumental career (the New York Times' 
John Martin proclaimed her "a genius" in six-column notices), owing to "a fugue 
of neuroses." She even intimates that a terror of failure paralyzed the dancer 
who canceled more performances than she gave. 
</P>
<P>
But when De Mille tells how she marched into Maracci's dressing room, 
cavalierly denouncing her friend's Ballet Theatre debut the way one scolds an 
errant cheerleader, the chronicler shows an insensitivity that borders on 
cruel: Maracci was so devastated by the verdict that she had to be carried from 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
In Maracci's brilliant letters, which De Mille quotes, the fugitive from the 
stage tried to explain to her friend why some people cannot be practical-minded 
enough to work within the system: "I was a rotten soldier, Agnes, and it is you 
who want people to be good ones." 
</P>
<P>
But De Mille denies ever making such appeals to her troubled friend, even while 
offering contradictory evidence right in the text: "I am more of an anarchist 
than ever," wrote Maracci. "I could never have danced as I did had I been an 
obedient servant." 
</P>
<P>
The above picture is a comparatively tempered one, perhaps owing to De Mille's 
compassion or sense of superiority over Maracci, at least in the way of worldly 
success. Overpowering the competition has a way of engendering charity. 
</P>
<P>
In the author's swipes at showman Billy Rose and her one-sided view of a 
weepingly puerile Alicia Markova, one can only be reminded that, at 81, De 
Mille may be looking to settle a few personal scores. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Sol Hurok, however, the author's pity for the subject somewhat 
neutralizes her animus. Perhaps because she knew that he was not universally 
liked or because she got to see his loneliness up close (as the wife of Hurok's 
aide-de-camp, Walter Prude, De Mille was on intimate terms with the definitive 
impresario), she rails against him less bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
So much for peer review. But when De Mille reminisces on her girlhood, a wholly 
different voice materializes: that of the dutiful daughter, even now still 
idealizing her parents. In quaint Victorian prose she refers to "Mother" and 
uses such phraseology as "Oh, pshaw" and "Father sired an illegitimate child." 
</P>
<P>
Unwittingly, Agnes de Mille reveals much about herself, and the picture is not 
always flattering. But she offers a provocative point of view for the reader 
equipped to discount her blind prejudices and episodes of defamation. 
</P>
<P>
When she is good, she is very, very good, and when she is bad she is just 
mean-spirited.

DEBATING 'A DEED OF DEATH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sidney Kirkpatrick's review of my book, "A Deed of Death," (Book Review, July 
22) mistakenly states that I was "unaware of the explosive new information" 
concerning "Mary's and her mother's frantic last trip to (William Desmond) 
Taylor's bungalow on the night of the murder, a trip never even alluded to in 
Giroux's book." Kirkpatrick commits three blunders in one sentence -- mistaking 
the date of the murder, confusing Minter's mother with her grandmother, and 
overlooking my detailed account of the visit. No competent reviewer would have 
skipped Pages 149-51 of my book, which reveal what happened, as recorded by 
Detective Lt. Edward C. King of the Los Angeles Police Department. This is not 
new, except to Kirkpatrick. It surfaced in 1930, as my bibliography shows. 
Kirkpatrick did not cover it in his 1986 book, "A Cast of Killers," since he 
knew nothing of it, and he has misread and misreported what he thinks he found 
in Minter's posthumous papers. 
</P>
<P>
Minter's visit to Taylor occurred not "on the night of the murder" (Wednesday, 
Feb. 1, 1922) but two nights before (Monday, Jan. 30). She was accompanied not 
by her hated mother, Charlotte Shelby, but by her devoted grandmother, Julia 
Miles ("I always call grandma 'mama' "). Since Minter went home carrying 
Taylor's goodby letter on the night of Jan. 30, Mother Shelby's motive for 
killing Taylor -- his "amorous advances" to her daughter, as Kirkpatrick puts 
it -- no longer existed. Yet Kirkpatrick would have us believe the mother shot 
him during this "frantic last trip to Taylor's bungalow," two nights before he 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Let me confirm that I certainly did depend on the "archival newspaper accounts" 
that Kirkpatrick sneers at, as well as on police records. I am indebted to The 
Times for Mary Miles Minter's long account ("the first I have ever given under 
my own name"), which she gave to The Times because it was "the only newspaper 
which has not hounded me day and night with questions, questions, questions 
about Mr. Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Kirkpatrick's statement that my book does not "begin to explain what 
the cover-up was all about" is hogwash. He ignores (or never read) Pages 31-49, 
which spell out the triple crisis -- the Fatty Arbuckle rape scandal, Wallace 
Reid's death from drugs, and Taylor's murder -- which, coming together in 1922, 
frightened Hollywood out of its wits for fear of federal censorship. "The movie 
bosses were anxious to suppress the whole thing," as my old friend King Vidor 
said. "They'd rather sacrifice Taylor than sacrifice the whole industry." 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT GIROUX 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Kirkpatrick replies: 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Giroux, in his spirited letter as in his book, makes no mention of 
Detective Lt. Leroy Sanderson's final, 10-page, confidential report to City 
Hall on June 13, 1941. That report, one among many that Mr. Giroux has 
overlooked, reads in part as follows: 
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable to assume that Mary visited Taylor on the night of Feb. 1, 
1922. Miss J. M. Berger (Minter's accountant) stated to Officers that Mrs. 
Shelby called her at 7 p.m., Feb. 1, 1922, and asked if she knew where Mary 
was. When informed by Miss Berger that she did not know Mary's whereabouts, 
Mrs. Shelby hung up the receiver. This would indicate that Mrs. Shelby was 
searching for Mary 45 minutes before Taylor was killed. Carl Stockdale 
testified . . . that he was with Mrs. Shelby from 7 to 9 p.m., Feb. 1, 1922. 
Mrs. Faith MacLean (Taylor's neighbor), when shown a picture of Stockdale, 
partially identified him as a suspect seen leaving Taylor's apartment, after 
the murder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Shelby made statements, in the presence of several persons, that she 
feared she would be indicted for the Taylor murder. By some means she evaded an 
official questioning concerning the Taylor murder, until April 9, 1926, and in 
that statement, she obviously misrepresented the truth concerning many facts. . 
. . She has never told the truth as to her whereabouts and actions on the night 
of Feb. 1, 1922. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary Miles Minter has stated that her mother said she had killed Taylor. Mrs. 
Shelby informed Miss Berger and Chauncey Eaton (Minter's chauffeur) before 7:30 
a.m. that Taylor was murdered. His body was not found until 7:30 a.m. The body 
was examined and it was believed he died from natural causes. It was not 
determined that he was murdered until 8 a.m. . . ."

SUNDAY IN THE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since Kirkpatrick's review of Giroux's "A Deed of Death" in large measure 
emphasizes the latter's "inadequacies," it seems in order to question the 
reviewer's opening sentence/paragraph: 
</P>
<P>
When did streetcars "rattle through Westlake Park"? 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s and much later, streetcars ran past the swank shops on Seventh 
Street -- the park's southern boundary. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps past the then quality apartments and hotels on Sixth Street, along 
the northern edge of the park. I can't pinpoint them at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
But to my knowledge, in modern times the only street through the park was and 
is trackless Wilshire Boulevard; the famed motorized thoroughfare extended east 
through the park many years after the nearby 1922 William Desmond Taylor murder 
on Alvarado, the park's eastern boundary. 
</P>
<P>
How young is the captious Mr. Kirkpatrick -- or when did he arrive from 
elsewhere? I was attending junior high school a little more than a mile south 
east of Westlake Park in 1922. Even those "nearby orange groves" he included in 
the opening sentence were something you saw only on a Sunday drive in the 
country.

JAMES FLANIGAN: BANK INDUSTRY LOSES AS CONSUMERS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's really going on with the banks? The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last 
week moved to raise the premiums banks must pay for government insurance on 
savings deposits. 
</P>
<P>
As well it should, you may say, considering that FDIC Chairman L. William 
Seidman told Congress only two weeks ago that the federal insurance fund would 
lose $2 billion this year as 200 banks fail -- the third straight year of 200 
or more banks going under. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Seidman told Congress, is that banks have made commercial real 
estate lending a bigger part of their business in recent years as they have 
lost other customers. And now they're encountering problem loans in "the 
weakest real estate markets in many years." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman however foresaw no sequel to the savings and loan debacle. The FDIC was 
raising premiums prudently to beef up the insurance fund, and might take other 
steps to restrict the loans banks could make with insured deposits. But "we're 
making a reasoned judgment; I see no panic here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And there's no need for panic. The banking system's finances are not nearly as 
precarious as were those of the S&amp;L industry, and its troubles stem from a 
lack of business competitiveness rather than fraud or foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
The real story in banking is the decline of its influence in our lives and in 
American business. One statistic speaks volumes: At the end of World War II, 
banks held 60% of the financial deposits in the United States. Today they hold 
less than 30%. The business of finance has grown much faster in the capital 
markets, where all sorts of companies and institutional investors borrow and 
lend money these days. 
</P>
<P>
It's a massive development in the financial system -- and yet one that 
practically everybody understands. Anybody who has bought a television set at a 
discount electronics store -- or financed a car through a dealer or invested in 
a money market mutual fund -- has participated in the capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
The TV dealer's inventory typically is financed by a company such as GE 
Capital, the $58-billion (assets) subsidiary of General Electric that is larger 
than most banks. Such finance companies raise money through commercial paper -- 
debt notes that are traded in the capital markets. There is now $550 billion in 
commercial paper outstanding, compared to $2.2 trillion in bank loans. But loan 
totals are growing slowly while commercial paper is growing more than 15% a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The largest auto lender in America is General Motors Acceptance Corp., which, 
at $100 billion in assets, is larger than almost all banks and long ago 
expanded into more than car loans. 
</P>
<P>
Money market mutual funds now hold $380 billion in deposits. That's still a 
long way from $2.2 trillion in total bank deposits -- but money funds are only 
part of the more than $1 trillion total investments in all mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Capital markets now finance home mortgages and student loans with the 
government's blessing and guarantees. And they finance consumer credit -- in 
the form of credit card receivables. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that banks, despite their government insurance, consistently have 
lost customers to capital markets. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously because banks are more expensive and less efficient than the markets 
in serving depositors and borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, bank expenses -- for branches and staffing -- are still 
geared to the days when they paid a regulated limit on savings accounts and 
nothing on checking and had little competition making loans at a good margin. 
</P>
<P>
But when all that changed more than a decade ago, banks had trouble being 
cost-competitive with money funds -- which serve depositors through telephone 
800 numbers and the mails. And on the loan side, the banks' higher expenses 
have prevented them from lending at competitive rates to big corporations, or 
even to the TV retailer or tractor dealer. 
</P>
<P>
So the banks have been relegated to less credit-worthy borrowers, such as real 
estate developers. And now they're in a downward spiral because reserves 
against real estate loan losses will only make their rates less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the outlook is for banks to make fewer loans, because the government 
wants it that way. Seidman suggested to Congress that banks should only use 
insured deposits for "conservative and safe" investments such as home 
mortgages. Banking expert Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution has 
testified to Congress that banks might also be allowed to invest insured 
deposits in government or high-grade corporate bonds, but not much more. "Why 
should they take risks with insured deposits," asks Litan rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
For any other business, including proposed diversification into securities and 
insurance, banks would operate through separate subsidiaries, and finance 
through the capital markets -- not insured deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is that banks will merge to cut staff and spread expenses, on 
computer systems and such, and today's 12,600 U.S. banks could be reduced by 
half. It will be a drastic weeding out of uncompetitive businesses, not a 
takeover bonanza, cautions analyst George Salem of Prudential-Bache Securities. 
Most banks will suffer, he says. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some regrets as banking shrinks. "Keep in mind that banks are the 
lenders to small business," says Julius Loeser, senior vice president of First 
Interstate Bancorp. Small businesses will now be forced to put up more 
collateral for loans. 
</P>
<P>
But the ability of consumers to shop for the highest interest will be 
undiminished. "The trend favors the consumer," says Michael Morrow, a partner 
in Sheshunoff &amp; Co., a bank consultancy firm. Banks, needing your deposits 
to stay in business, will offer market rates and services at various prices. 
And if a bank can't offer what you want, some other institution will. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling today is if our money is working hard, earning the most it can, 
that's the right way," says Morrow. Deposit insurance is important, but 
secondary for most consumers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a sophisticated, intensely competitive financial system. It's a 
system that American consumers voted for with their pocketbooks. And what we're 
seeing today is that a lot of banks didn't read the election returns.

FORCED TO UNLOAD JUNK BONDS, FARWEST NEEDS BELZBERGS' HELP TO SURVIVE; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: FEARED AS RAIDERS, THE CANNY CANADIANS FACE A DILEMMA. INVEST MORE IN 
FARWEST? OR LET IT COLLAPSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
FarWest Savings had long been a good investment for the Belzberg brothers of 
Canada -- Samuel, Hyman and William. 
</P>
<P>
Acquiring FarWest in 1974 gave the Belzbergs a foothold in the United States. 
Then, using the Newport Beach thrift and First City Financial Corp. Ltd. in 
Vancouver, Canada, they became among the most feared corporate raiders and 
takeover strategists on the U.S. scene during the 1980s. Often acting as 
greenmailers, their hostile bids made them millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But today, their U.S. flagship is in danger of sinking. On Thursday, federal 
regulators imposed operating restrictions on FarWest, prohibiting the purchase 
and sale of assets and the making of any loans without regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
The action is a blow to the Belzbergs -- and puts greater pressure on them to 
bail out the faltering institution. Without a fresh infusion of capital, 
FarWest is likely to join the government's portfolio of failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrift's survival is largely predicated on what their principal owners 
want to do," said Gerry Findley, a Brea banking and thrift consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Like some other high-flying S&amp;Ls, Newport Beach-based FarWest's problem 
stems not so much from bad loans -- the savings and loan has been profitable on 
an operating basis -- but from huge investments in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest officials say it is being brought down by the federal law designed to 
save the S&amp;L industry -- the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and 
Enforcement Act of 1989. The new law banned junk bonds -- high-yield, high-risk 
debt securities -- from thrift portfolios by July, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift has been staking its revival on a plan that called for trimming 
assets, selling junk bonds and bolstering capital with a new stock offering to 
shareholders of its parent firm, FarWest Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest officials have admitted that a failure to get the plan approved could 
be fatal. "The company's ability to continue as a going concern depends upon 
receiving approval of a plan," the company said in a recent filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But regulators in the San Francisco office of the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
which oversees thrifts, last week rejected the plan. FarWest has appealed the 
matter to thrift regulators in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Green, chief executive of FarWest, said the regulators, in part, 
objected to how the thrift wants to treat a subsidiary holding junk bonds and 
equity real estate investments. The thrift wants to liquidate the unit and fold 
it into the thrift as a direct holding. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan's rejection is upheld, FarWest would have to write off about $60 
million in capital, rendering it insolvent with a negative net worth of $23.6 
million to $75 million depending on accounting and tax considerations, the 
thrift says. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculate that another major problem may be an unwillingness by the 
Belzbergs, who control 57% of FarWest Financial, to commit themselves to 
putting more of their own money into the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"Other investors would want the assurance that the Belzbergs are coming in," 
said Kenneth H. Thomas of Miami, an industry consultant. "If the Belzbergs 
don't come in, investors would wonder why they should step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Neither William Belzberg, chairman of FarWest Financial and FarWest Savings, 
nor Samuel Belzberg, chairman of First City, responded to several requests for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest is among a handful of large thrifts that together acquired billions of 
dollars of junk bonds through Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
Earlier this year, Drexel filed for bankruptcy and Milken pleaded guilty to 
criminal charges stemming from his junk bond activities. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those that loaded up on junk bonds make up a rogues gallery of troubled 
thrifts now under regulatory control: Lincoln Savings in Irvine, Imperial 
Savings in San Diego, Gibraltar Savings in Simi Valley, CenTrust Bank in Miami 
and Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan in Denver. Columbia Savings in 
Beverly Hills was the biggest junk bond buyer among thrifts but has not been 
seized. 
</P>
<P>
Although some industry analysts and consultants feel that FarWest once stood a 
better chance than its beleaguered brethren of surviving, they now say the 
regulatory restrictions could be a prelude to a federal takeover. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1989, FarWest Savings had $667 million in junk bonds, about 14% of 
its $4.8 billion in assets. The company has written down its junk bond holdings 
since. Its portfolio was valued at $395 million as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L lost $46.1 million last year, $25.8 million in the first quarter of 
1990 and $3.7 million more in the second quarter. Most of the red ink is 
attributed to the writedown of its junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
While solvent, FarWest does not meet the tougher capital standards imposed by 
the new federal thrift law. As of June 30, its $37.7 million in tangible 
capital, one measure of stability under federal law, was $23.6 million short of 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
It also faces several troubling lawsuits. FarWest was slapped earlier this year 
with a $24-million judgment by a Denver jury. The civil case, which FarWest has 
appealed, alleges that the thrift reneged on a $5-million loan and ruined the 
plaintiff's business. In another case, four shareholders allege that FarWest 
wasted assets through its junk bond activities. 
</P>
<P>
Although it continues to make a profit on operations, the thrift has been hurt 
by loans it made in Colorado, Utah and Texas in the mid-1980s. FarWest stopped 
lending in those states three years ago when the loans soured with the energy 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, FarWest executives say they are confident about the 
thrift's future if they can overcome regulatory hurdles. They say they have 
already taken several steps to turn FarWest around. 
</P>
<P>
* Last year, the holding company contributed $12.5 million of its cash in hand 
to the S&amp;L's capital base. 
</P>
<P>
* To help meet capital standards, FarWest is reducing its assets. Thrift 
officials said that, in the second quarter, assets were cut to $3.7 billion, 
partly by selling a mortgage banking unit to managers who started it six years 
ago. The S&amp;L plans to shrink to as low as $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* FarWest has cut staff and overhead expenses. 
</P>
<P>
* Under a regulatory mandate, the thrift is reducing costs by eliminating 
brokered deposits, the large-denomination funds that seek the highest interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
* Lending has been nearly halted. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the key to FarWest's survival is more capital, the thrift's final 
cushion against losses. But it is unclear whether the Belzbergs are willing to 
risk any more of their own cash. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to whether it is in their interest to preserve this and salvage 
their investment," said Finley. "Or they may be at the point of saying, 'Oh 
well, let that thing go. We've got better things to put our money in.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs would not be the first to walk away from a thrift investment. 
</P>
<P>
On August 3, M. Lee Pearce quit as chairman of AmeriFirst Bank in Miami, saying 
he would not risk any more funds without more cooperation from regulators. 
Pearce had invested $8.5 million in ailing AmeriFirst 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the Belzbergs read about people like Pearce, and they may say, 
'Sometimes you run up against a team you just can't beat,' and they may leave 
the industry," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs certainly have a keen eye for what makes economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
Sons of a Polish immigrant, the characteristically close-mouthed brothers built 
an empire from their base in Calgary, where their father, Abraham, operated a 
furniture store. Hyman, 63, runs that store, Cristy's Arcade, today. 
</P>
<P>
Sam, now 62 and the only brother with a college degree, led his brothers first 
into real estate and oil and gas leases in Alberta. In 1962, needing financing, 
he started City Savings &amp; Trust Co. in Calgary, the predecessor to First 
City Financial's banking unit, First City Trust Co. It grew to become one of 
the largest financial institutions in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs gained widespread attention in their native land in 1973 when 
they sold their majority interest -- 62% -- in a real estate firm for $48 
million, without requiring the buyers to offer the same terms to minority 
shareholders. The following year, in a friendly transaction, they won 
controlling interest in FarWest Financial. 
</P>
<P>
William Belzberg, 57, moved to Los Angeles in 1976 to oversee the family's 
first major investment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The combined assets of FarWest, First City Financial and First City Properties 
-- estimated at about $7 billion by 1980 -- allowed the Belzbergs to raise 
capital for more serious empire building. Their corporate entities often 
provided financing for corporate takeovers or joined in as investor partners. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, FarWest backed a Belzberg-led effort to acquire Bekins Co. in 
Glendale. The company, however, abandoned this effort to join Texas oilman T. 
Boone Pickens' investment group in a raid on Gulf Oil Corp. The hostile bid for 
Gulf put the giant oil firm in play and sent its stock soaring. Chevron 
eventually bought Gulf, and FarWest walked away with a profit of $8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs did not stop with Gulf. They took runs at many companies, 
including Blue Bell, H. H. Robertson, U.S. Industries, Masonite and Ashland 
Oil. But they gained a reputation as raiders and greenmailers, mostly looking 
to be paid to go away. 
</P>
<P>
So feared were the Belzbergs that in 1986 when they took a small position in 
Southland Corp., the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, the 
controlling Thompson family scrambled to keep the company. The Thompsons took 
Southland private in a $5.3-billion leveraged buyout. But the huge debt load 
forced Southland into bankruptcy this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs have taken control of some companies. Analysts thought the 
brothers had overpaid for Scovill Inc., a Connecticut company that made Yale 
locks and Hamilton Beach household appliances. They soon sold off all but one 
division for $176 million, more than they paid for the entire company in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, FarWest grew steadily on the fuel from the profits of attempted 
takeovers as well as from traditional thrift operations and junk bond 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
It built a mortgage banking operation in six years to a $1.5-billion portfolio 
at the end of last year. The S&amp;L moved more aggressively into construction 
lending for single-family homes and apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But it was junk bonds and brokered deposits that gave the S&amp;L its biggest 
boost, helping it grow from $1.1 billion in assets at the end of 1982, when 
deregulation opened the doors to a wide array of new investments, to nearly $5 
billion last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite regulators' concerns about junk bonds, the S&amp;L continues to 
emphasize that it is making money on an operating basis. However, it increased 
reserves for loan and investment losses by $16.9 million in the second quarter. 
And the company noted that its regular annual examination under way could 
result in additional reserves being set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the junk bond problem, FarWest is "doing quite well and, given time, 
will sort itself out," said industry consultant David L. Smith, managing 
associate of Kaplan, Smith &amp; Associates in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest's junk bond portfolio has several securities that were in default this 
year, including those of Braniff, Eastern Airlines and Southmark Corp., all of 
which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But the thrift maintains that its junk 
bond portfolio overall, including investments in McCaw Cellular, National 
Intergroup, RJR Nabisco and Pacific Lumber, is performing well and providing 
needed income. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts, however, don't buy the virtues of junk bonds, at least for 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, an expert on junk holdings by thrifts, charges that thrifts simply 
never had any business putting federally insured deposits at such a high risk 
by investing them in junk bonds. From the start, he said, the bonds were 
grossly overpriced by Milken and Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
"With or without (the new federal law), major junk bond defaults were bound to 
occur," he said.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: BUILD A RAINY DAY FUND TO CUSHION ADVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do you have a big enough financial cushion to withstand the recession that many 
economists say is coming or is already here? If you lost your job or suffered 
other financial setbacks, could you make it through the transition? 
</P>
<P>
If the answer is no, or you aren't sure, start now to build up your financial 
reserves. You don't want to be caught without adequate rainy day funds or with 
retirement savings that you could lose if your employer goes bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Building a financial cushion "will put you well on your way to financial 
security," says Jonathan D. Pond, president of Financial Planning Information, 
a Watertown, Mass., publisher of financial planning information. "People who 
are well prepared for a recession have been doing this all along." 
</P>
<P>
Financial advisers say you should have accessible savings equaling three months 
of your gross income. That includes any assets that are readily converted into 
cash, such as money in savings accounts and mutual funds or widely traded 
stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have this three-month cushion, get serious about building up 
savings. Set a goal of saving at least 10% of your income. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inexcusable not to save 10% of your gross income, and most people should 
aspire to 15% or 20%," Pond says. 
</P>
<P>
There are several ways to save automatically. Enroll in a payroll savings plan 
at work that will put your money in U.S. savings bonds or in a credit union 
savings account. Get your bank to pull money automatically from your checking 
account into your savings account. 
</P>
<P>
Get a mutual fund that will automatically draw a certain amount each month from 
your checking account. Change your withholding to reduce the refund you receive 
later so you can get more take-home pay now -- and funnel the extra into 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
Cut your spending. Make a list of what you spend every day, and look for a few 
things to drop, such as those gourmet cookies. "Take your lunch to work, don't 
buy it," Pond suggests. "That could save you $1,000 a year, $4 a day." 
</P>
<P>
Cut out your expensive vacation, or take a cheaper one. Give thoughtful 
handmade gifts instead of fancy crystal. Make a budget and stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure your rainy day funds are in safe investments that are quickly turned 
into cash. Such investments include federally insured savings accounts (but be 
careful about certificates of deposit, because of early withdrawal penalties). 
They also include Treasury bills, which mature in one year or less, and most 
money market mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Be wary if a lot of your wealth is tied up in assets not easily convertible 
into cash. In a recession, it may be hard to sell certain hard assets, such as 
investment real estate or limited partnership shares. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, if the tax impact is manageable, consider selling some of those 
assets now to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, make your debt manageable and reduce it if necessary. High debt can 
be a burden -- even a disaster -- in a recession. 
</P>
<P>
As a rule of thumb, your debt payments should not be more than 35% of your 
gross income if you have a mortgage, and not more than 10% if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
If you exceed these levels, absolutely DON'T add to your debt. Dump one or more 
of your credit cards. Postpone buying that new car. And don't borrow for 
anything "perishable," such as a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Start paying down your debt only if you have saved enough to amass three 
months' worth of income in your rainy day fund. 
</P>
<P>
If your borrowing problems are serious, you might want to contact a local 
office of Consumer Credit Counselors, a nonprofit organization that can help 
you manage your debts and work with creditors to develop a repayment program. 
The National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver Spring, Md., at (800) 
388-2227, can provide a referral to the nearest office. 
</P>
<P>
But be careful to avoid so-called credit doctors or credit-repair clinics that 
offer to fix your credit for a fee. Those fees can be hefty, and they usually 
don't do what they say they'll do. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, make your retirement savings less vulnerable. A recession increases 
the chances that your employer could go bankrupt of suffer other dire 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if you are in a 401(k) company savings plan, be sure that your funds are 
not all tied up in your firm's stock or bonds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EXPENSES TO ANTICIPATE 
</P>
<P>
Do you often fail to anticipate large, less-than-monthly expenses, and find 
yourself unable to pay them? To avoid that, author Jonathan D. Pond suggests 
setting up a separate savings account to cover less-frequent expenses. Take the 
following list of expenses and calculate what you'll need for each category:

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: WAYS TO SMOOTH OUT MARKET'S UPS AND DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the going gets tough, investors are supposed to hang tough. But instead, 
when the stock market stumbles, investors tend to head for cover in droves. 
Just look at all the nervous selling over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
For skittish types, it can make sense to follow a "dollar cost averaging" 
approach to mutual fund investing. That's a highfalutin term for a fairly 
simple process. 
</P>
<P>
It means investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, perhaps every month or 
every quarter, so you wind up buying shares at various prices -- fewer shares 
when prices are high and more when they're low. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage is that it "removes the guesswork and difficulty of trying to 
time the market," said Anne Patenaude, vice president of marketing with the 
Pioneer Funds group in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
You can rest assured that you won't be putting all your marbles into play at a 
market peak. "Dollar cost averaging gives you time diversification," said John 
Markese, director of research for the American Assn. of Individual Investors in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
You can follow a dollar cost averaging strategy to purchase many types of 
assets, from gold coins to stocks. But the process works especially well with 
mutual funds, which routinely accept small periodic investments and will credit 
you with a fractional purchase of shares. Averaging is more common with equity 
funds rather than bond funds because of the greater volatility of the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Most mutual fund companies require initial investments ranging from $250 to 
$3,000 or so, with subsequent purchases of at least $50 to $250. However, Janus 
Funds of Denver and Twentieth Century Investors of Kansas City -- two families 
with good track records -- will accept contributions of any size for initial 
purchases or subsequent investments. 
</P>
<P>
You can automatically buy shares in a mutual fund by taking money from your 
paycheck or bank account at regular intervals. There's usually no charge for 
this service, other than the normal front-end sales fee if you invest in a load 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is to transfer cash gradually into a stock or bond fund from a 
money market portfolio within the same family. If you get a large chunk of cash 
all of a sudden -- from a pension withdrawal or inheritance, for example -- 
this can be a good way to ease into the market, says Paul Merriman, head of the 
Merriman Funds group in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to set up an automatic dollar cost averaging program. You may 
simply write a check each time you want to invest. However, there's a danger in 
relying on your own impulses. 
</P>
<P>
"When the market takes a big hit, that's when people tend to throw in the 
towel," Merriman said. To succeed with an averaging strategy, you need to keep 
investing through at least one full market cycle. Nobody likes to invest during 
bearish phases, yet that's the time when prices are lowest. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there's substantial evidence that a dollar cost averaging strategy can 
work nicely with a well-managed, well-diversified mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
American Funds Group of Los Angeles offers a worst-case illustration of dollar 
cost averaging. Suppose you placed $5,000 into the company's American Mutual 
Fund each year from 1970 through 1989. Further imagine that you had the unlucky 
knack of making your investments exclusively on the worst possible day in each 
calendar year -- such as Aug. 25, 1987, the high point before the market 
crashed two months later. Would you show a big loss? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, your total investment of $100,000 would have grown to nearly 
$538,000 at the end of 1989, representing a 14.3% compounded annual gain. The 
moral of the story: It's more important to keep adding to your stake in a good 
fund than to worry about the best times to buy along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, dollar cost averaging assumes that equity funds will rise over the 
long term. That's a pretty solid bet, considering that the stock market has 
declined in just 19 of the 64 years back to 1926. At any rate, it's certainly 
wiser to keep plowing money into a well-diversified fund than a single stock, 
because you never know if a company is going down for good. 
</P>
<P>
One criticism of dollar cost averaging is that it addresses just half of the 
investment equation -- it tells you how and when to buy shares but provides no 
guidelines for selling. Michael E. Edleson, assistant professor of business 
administration at the Harvard School of Business, believes that he has found an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the American Assn. of Individual Investors Journal, Edleson 
recommends an approach that he describes as "value averaging." Rather than 
invest, say, $100 each month, you would instead follow a strategy of making 
your fund grow by $100 a month. In other words, you would first figure out how 
much your portfolio went up or down during the month, then add -- or even 
subtract -- money to make sure the overall increase amounted to $100. 
</P>
<P>
For example, suppose you had $4,000 in a fund on Aug. 31 and wanted to see it 
grow by $100 a month, to $4,100 as of Sept. 30. Here's how you would respond to 
three different scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
* If a falling market during September pulled down your investment in the fund 
to, say, $3,900, you would add $200 to reach the $4,100 level. 
</P>
<P>
* If a slowly rising market increased your stake to $4,030, you would add $70 
for the month. 
</P>
<P>
* If a strong rally carried you up to $4,270 during September, you would sell 
$170 worth of shares. 
</P>
<P>
Edleson claims that his system is more profitable than regular dollar cost 
averaging. "It forces you to buy even more than usual when the share price goes 
exceptionally low," he said. In addition, it prompts you to sell shares during 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
He tested the two averaging methods using his own money during a 25-month 
period from 1986 to 1988. Edleson wound up investing at an average cost of 
$4.07 a share using his system, compared to $4.85 for traditional dollar cost 
averaging. 
</P>
<P>
Edleson admits that his approach isn't perfect. It's more complicated than 
regular dollar cost averaging, and it can force you to regularly incur capital 
gains taxes on shares you sell at a profit. Also, you might be subject to 
minimum investment or redemption restrictions, depending on the fund company. 
</P>
<P>
The key point is that an averaging strategy of some type can help you come to 
terms with volatility. As a result, you can stay invested for the long haul, 
with less emotional wear and tear along the way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW AN INVESTOR WOULD FARE WITH DOLLAR COST AVERAGING 
</P>
<P>
The following shows how an investor would have fared with a dollar cost 
averaging approach to investing in stocks. It assumes that the investor placed 
$100 a month every month from January, 1978, through December, 1989, into the 
T. Rowe Price New Era Fund. It also assumes that all dividends and capital 
gains were reinvested. The investor's outlay during the 12-year period would 
have been $14,400. Below are three representative years.

RECYCLING EFFORT TAKES HOLD ON THE WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
From the beaches to the barrios, recycling is taking hold. 
</P>
<P>
In an often-repeated scene, young and old, affluent and poor, homeowners and 
homeless arrive at Westside supermarkets and recycling centers with bags, 
boxes, and an occasional shopping cart filled with cans and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The lure for many is the higher redemption value for some beverage containers. 
Since January, the price paid for aluminum cans and regular beer bottles has 
soared from a penny to 2 1/2 cents per container. Large plastic and glass 
bottles are now worth a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
The money is enough of an incentive for some to start recycling. But a growing 
awareness of environmental problems -- a byproduct of Earth Day -- has also 
helped. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a little extra cash prompted Santa Monica High School student 
Omar Ezzeldine to haul three months' worth of soft drink cans and plastic 
bottles to a Lucky supermarket on Lincoln Boulevard one day last week. 
</P>
<P>
A first-time recycler, Ezzeldine and his mother, Ena, fed the cans and bottles 
into a reverse vending machine that pays customers for their beverage 
containers. After crushing the cans and shredding the plastic, the machine, in 
a sound vaguely reminiscent of a Las Vegas one-armed bandit, dispenses nickels. 
</P>
<P>
The total jackpot for this load of aluminum and plastic approached $2.50. "Not 
bad for trash," Ena Ezzeldine said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, a grandmother en route to the supermarket brought a bag of cans 
to recycle. "I really just started," she said. "I just started reading about 
it. We should do our bit and recycle." 
</P>
<P>
She said the money goes into a bank for her grandson. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who lives near the beach in Santa Monica pulled a trash bag filled with 
beer and soft drink cans to the machine. "I don't do it for the money. I'm just 
concerned about the environment," she said. "It's not good to waste natural 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
She said the higher price paid for recycling beverage containers "doesn't make 
too much difference to me." 
</P>
<P>
But for others, "canning," as they call it, has become a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Cris Santana is homeless. She sleeps in her car. During the day, she and other 
homeless people spend hours combing the back alleys of the Westside looking for 
cans and bottles that have been thrown away. "This is how it is when you're 
down and out," Santana said. 
</P>
<P>
There's one place Santana avoids: the beach. "Early canners go through all the 
trash cans at the beach," gathering all the recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
Santana prefers the area around Marina del Rey. "The Marina is rich" with 
beverage containers and champagne bottles. She tries to get to the recycling 
center every day. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get paid a whole lot," she said. "I'm trying to make a living, but 
you can't." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott Bailiff, a homeless man who lives in his van, also collects cans and 
bottles. "I know a lot of people who go canning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bailiff complains that many recycling centers refuse to accept wine and liquor 
bottles that do not have a redemption value. "If they are really serious about 
recycling, they should take all of these things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another man who said his name was Tom told of working the alleys of Venice and 
Santa Monica. He said he can earn $20 to $22 for six hours' work collecting 
cans and bottles. "I've got to do a little bit of dumpster-diving, but I ain't 
shy about what I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
These scavengers are what Gary Petersen, who started Ecolo-Haul, one of the 
Westside's first recycling businesses, calls "professional collectors." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen, now a vice president of Waste Management Inc., said there is a very 
big underground business composed of people who collect cans and bottles to 
make their living. 
</P>
<P>
Like others in the industry, Petersen has seen a "tremendous increase" in 
recycling. "My centers are busier than hell," he said. The upsurge reflects a 
simple fact that the higher the value, the more recycling occurs. 
</P>
<P>
But Petersen also believes that a new environmental ethic and awareness has 
contributed to the increase in recycling of material that lacks a redemption 
value. For example, he notes a sharp increase in newspapers dropped off along 
with the empty beer and Bordeaux bottles at a recycling center in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Graff, assistant general manager of ENVIPCO, the company that created 
and now operates the reverse-vending machines found at many supermarkets, said 
the volume of aluminum cans being recycled at the company's machines has 
tripled since January. "It's mostly the raise in the redemption value," he 
said. "When it was a penny, things were very, very flat and redemption was 
low." 
</P>
<P>
Graff said the amount of plastic being recycled has increased fivefold. The 
company operates about 1,500 machines at 500 locations, including Von's, Lucky, 
and some Alpha Beta and Boys markets. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Johnson, vice president of 20/20 Recycle Centers, said public awareness of 
environmental issues stemming from Earth Day last April is a factor in the 
sharp increase in recycling. "We've seen a surge that, in our opinion, goes 
beyond the increase in the value." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Schweitzer, president of Mobile Recycling, which operates 130 staffed 
recycling centers at Ralphs and Alpha Beta stores, agreed that "Earth Day 
seemed to be a watershed date." 
</P>
<P>
Mobile Recycling's operations coordinator, Samuel Totor, said environmental 
concern is a "very big part" of the boost in recycling. "Not everybody is going 
to recycle for the money. But if they have another reason to they will," Totor 
said. "The upper strata basically don't need to recycle for the money, but they 
are concerned about the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Such concern may have been responsible for a sharp rise in the amount of glass, 
aluminum and plastic collected curbside by the city of Los Angeles. According 
to city Bureau of Sanitation figures, 209,950 pounds of recyclable material was 
picked up in the Westside collection area in June, more than 30,000 pounds more 
than in January. Pilot curbside collection programs are operated in parts of 
Pacific Palisades, Cheviot Hills, Beverlywood and Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
The boost in recycling is gratifying to Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los 
Angeles), who authored the law that established California's system of 
redemption values for beverage containers. 
</P>
<P>
"Return rates are moving up rather dramatically," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that about 75% of all the aluminum cans, 50% of the 
glass containers and 15% of the plastic bottles sold in the state are being 
recycled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Margolin said the battle to encourage recycling is far from over. His bill 
to impose a five-cent deposit on liquor and wine bottles was killed last week 
in a state Senate committee.

BEST BET

Jazz is on tap, and the rap is its super. In fact, the Jazz Tap Ensemble, 
appearing this week at the Westwood Playhouse, got one Noo Yawk Times reviewer 
to tap out a riff of compliments: "With hard-working nonchalance, the 
innovative troupe burst open with a virtuosic brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers work in complete integration with the musicians in the Ensemble. As 
a result, the music becomes as important as the dancing." People say the 
writer's feet moved as fast as his hands when he was typing it. Jazz Tap 
Ensemble gets you that way. In July, they played Harlem's Apollo Theatre, with 
Gregory Hines. After this gig, they're off to France for the Biennale de la 
Danse, the world's largest dance festival. We've seen 'em several times, and 
each time for a week afterward, worn out twice the usual pair of shoes. But 
hey, always ready to sacrifice a little sole for a little soul, we'll go again. 
Besides, this time in Westwood, Eddie Brown is the guest artist. He's been 
dancing for more than 50 years. With Billie Holiday. With Joe Turner. With 
Dizzy Gillespie. With verve and wisdom. Brown's famous for his improvisational 
passages, so he'll fit right in at JTE, where artistic director Lynn Dally is 
famous for hiring the best, and letting the spirit flow. Three dancers 
(including Dally herself) and four musicians make up the troupe. The show will 
be at 8 p.m. Aug. 23, 24 and 25, at 10886 Le Conte Ave., Westwood Village. 
Tickets are $18, $14, and $10 for students and seniors who shuffle off and 
appear a half-hour before curtain time. Box office number is (213) 208-5454.

BIGGEST SPENDER LOST IN MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: PAUL SHOOP SPENT $33,700 OF HIS MONEY AND FINISHED 10TH. LARRY WAN 
SPENT $32,674 AND WAS ELECTED, THE SECOND-HIGHEST VOTE GETTER. 
</P>

<P>
A land-use attorney who spent $33,700 of his own money topped the list of 
campaign spenders in a losing bid to gain a seat on Malibu's future City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Shoop, who declined to accept campaign contributions en route to a 
10th-place finish among 30 candidates in the June election, spent nearly three 
times as much as top vote-getter Walt Keller, according to records filed with 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, the former co-chairman of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, spent 
$11,400 in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The group's other former co-chairwoman, Carolyn Van Horn, who finished fourth 
to claim a seat on the five-member council, spent only $6,703, the least of any 
of the winners. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures, required by law, showed that many of the candidates dipped 
heavily into their own pockets in a bid to win a seat on the council at the 
same time voters overwhelmingly approved Malibu becoming a city. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Shoop, only two other candidates spent more than $20,000 on the 
campaign, and about half the candidates spent $1,000 or less, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wan, the former head of the Malibu Township Council who finished second, 
was the second-highest spender, with $32,674, including $24,000 from his own 
pocket. Real estate broker Richard Idler was the other big spender, with 
$28,399. He finished 12th. 
</P>
<P>
The other winners, third-place finisher Mike Caggiano, and Missy Zeitsoff, who 
was fifth, followed Idler on the spending list, with $18,824 and $13,679, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as of last week, the only organized group to oppose incorporation 
had not filed campaign disclosure forms that were due July 31, county election 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Concerned Citizens for the Protection of Malibu's Future called 
the matter an oversight and said that the group intended to submit its records 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been out of town for about a month and, as a result, we haven't filed, 
but we fully intend to do so soon," said Margaret Richards, the group's 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the group, which organized about three weeks before the June 5 
election, "probably spent something on the order of $2,100. It wasn't much 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters had accused the group of engaging in a last-minute campaign 
of deception and said it was a front for real estate developers concerned that 
cityhood would restrict growth. 
</P>
<P>
Its cause was not helped by disclosures that neither Richards nor Glenn Heller, 
the group's chairman, were eligible to vote in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Heller, a caterer, moved to Malibu three months before the election and said he 
was registered to vote in Los Angeles. Richards, a Malibu resident for 15 
years, is a citizen of Canada. She owns a Santa Monica advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although opponents of cityhood had little success attracting money or votes, 
the Malibu Committee for Incorporation had little trouble with either in 
sailing toward cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The group reported having spent $99,715 on behalf of incorporation. In the 
election, 84% of the voters supported cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Among those donating money to the group were celebrities Herb Alpert, Mel 
Brooks, Olivia Newton-John, Henry Mancini, Bob Newhart, Carroll O'Connor, 
George C. Scott, James Whitmore and Burgess Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
Despite spending enough money to give them high name recognition, Shoop and 
Idler were targets of negative newspaper ads by cityhood supporters, which 
portrayed them as having something to gain by Malibu's remaining an 
unincorporated part of the county.

LIBRARIES LURE CHILDREN WITH ARTS, SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
LITERACY: THERE'S NOTHING HUSH-HUSH ABOUT WESTSIDE SUMMER READING PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DENNE, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children who visit Westside libraries this summer will not find the traditional 
hush-hush reading environment. Librarians are using arts and crafts, puppet 
shows, wildlife on wheels, and boisterous storytelling hours to lure children 
into the library. 
</P>
<P>
County and city libraries offer summer reading programs that encourage children 
to keep up their literary skills during the summer months and have fun at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
The annual programs are theme oriented and attempt to motivate children to read 
by offering prizes and incentives such as stickers, buttons, bookmarks, book 
bags and a party at the end of the summer. The children earnestly record each 
book they read in a folder as they collect their prizes. 
</P>
<P>
The number of children who participate in the county and city programs ranges 
from 50 to more than 300 at each branch. 
</P>
<P>
"We do this every summer," said Karen Seybold, a Westchester resident who 
admits being confused trying to keep track of books from the three libraries 
where her son is participating in reading programs. "It's a nice summertime 
activity, a nice interlude between going to the pool and going to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
City libraries have a Western theme, tagged the Reading Roundup, although each 
branch has creative freedom to develop the program. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Strelioff, children's librarian at the Palms-Rancho branch, created a 
pioneer game played out on the window of the children's section. Each child has 
a pioneer woman or cowboy taped to the window, where the children stake out 
homesteads. "As they read books, they can purchase things for their homestead, 
like pigs, cows, pitchforks or wheelbarrows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Loyola Village branch library, construction paper prairie dogs with 
bandannas and cowboy hats decorate the windows of the children's section. Each 
child participating has a dog taped to the window, and for every five books 
read, a star is added to its hat. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Morelli, 7, looked through the shelves at Loyola Village for more books 
while his mother recorded his previous week's reading. Toting a plastic 
pull-string book bag, a prize for reading two books, Morelli proudly displayed 
his own library card. 
</P>
<P>
Eric's mother, Liz Morelli, said she is pleased with her son's participation. 
"He walks around with a book in front of his face," she said, adding that the 
summer reading program keeps children's minds active. "It gives them community 
support for something that should be encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
Children who participate in the program at the Westchester branch city library 
set a goal for the number of books they want to read, and if they reach that 
goal, they receive a free paperback book donated by the Friends of the Library. 
</P>
<P>
"They set themselves high goals," said children's librarian Margaret Darmody. 
"Even the beginning readers will set a goal of five to 10." Some children read 
more than 60 books during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
At the county libraries, children must tell a librarian about each book they 
read, write a summary or draw a picture before they can write the title in 
their folders. 
</P>
<P>
"The children like to have someone to come in and talk to about the books," 
said Sandy Nagy, children's library assistant at the Culver City county 
library. 
</P>
<P>
Merrick Hamer has performed dramatic storytelling at county libraries for the 
past 10 summers. "Anything that's dramatic and silly will evoke a response," he 
said, adding that acting out the stories appeals to young children who do not 
read yet. The summer program, he said, "gives children an environment of books 
for the summer. It keeps them in touch with books. That is our great 
objective." 
</P>
<P>
Darmody, who has been a children's librarian for 30 years, said the summer 
reading program has changed since it began in the city libraries in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally there was more competition involved," she said. "They're stressing 
non-competition now. It's supposed to be recreational reading. The only thing I 
tell the children is it has to be a real book. It has to have a beginning, a 
middle and an end." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Babka, children's librarian for the Marina del Rey branch, said that 
during the three summer months when school is out, many young children lose 
their reading skills. The library programs encourage them to continue reading. 
</P>
<P>
"Libraries try to teach that (reading) is a joy and a lifelong interest," Babka 
said. "If we lose the child now, we're not going to have anyone to service in 
20 years."

LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS: FROM YOUNG GUN TO YOUNG WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRK HONEYCUTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the side of a tenement building near MacArthur Park that serves as a key 
location for Lou Diamond Phillips' new film, "Mind Game," is a billboard 
promoting the just-released "Young Guns II," in which he stars with Emilio 
Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland and Christian Slater. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year Phillips has appeared in the supernatural horror film "The 
First Power" and the political thriller "Show of Force." Since his film career 
was launched three years ago with "La Bamba," in which he played the late 
rocker Ritchie Valens, Phillips has made 10 films. 
</P>
<P>
Too much exposure? Too many roles? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any regrets yet," says the 28-year-old actor, during a break on 
the "Mind Game" set recently. "A lot of films have come along that appealed to 
me for a variety of reasons. Yet I still turn down many more than I accept." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, one reason for the flood of offers is the actor's "crossover" status: 
in the eyes of Hollywood dealmakers, Phillips is one of the few ethnic actors 
who can carry a film. And his ethnicity is sufficiently vague -- Scots-Irish 
and Cherokee Indian on his father's side and Filipino with strains of Chinese 
and Spanish on his mother's -- that Phillips jokes, "I can play what's in me 
the rest of my life and never do the same role twice." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he's made a good stab at exactly that, playing Mexican-American in "La 
Bamba" and "Stand and Deliver," Lakota Sioux in "Renegades," Navaho-Mexican in 
"Young Guns I and II," Irish in "The First Power," Puerto Rican in "Show of 
Force," plus non-ethnic roles in the feature film "Disorganized Crime" and the 
made-for-TV movie "The Three Kings." 
</P>
<P>
In "Mind Game," a psychological thriller that Phillips wrote, he deliberately 
created his character as a Filipino. "I figured this was probably my only 
chance to play what is a large portion of my (ethnic) makeup." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips plays a struggling novelist discouraged by numerous publishers' 
rejections. Looking for an instant best-seller, he strikes up a friendship with 
a mass murderer (Clancy Brown) newly released from prison. As their 
relationship evolves into something darker, the film hopes to raise questions 
about ambition and what people will do to gain success. 
</P>
<P>
These questions were certainly on Phillips' mind the night four years ago when 
he conceived the story. This occurred, he says, while waiting for a traffic 
light to change at an intersection in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
" 'La Bamba' had been finished but it wasn't going to come out for a year," he 
says. "I made little on 'La Bamba' and was worried about money running out. 
Casting agents liked me but I had no jobs. They wanted to wait and see how 'La 
Bamba' did. At the same time people were whispering in my ear, 'This movie is 
going to do it. "La Bamba" is your big break.' 
</P>
<P>
"So waiting at that light, I started thinking about what I was going to do when 
this movie finally did open on a Friday night and the next day I'm a known 
entity. How is this kid from Texas going to deal with that? Those themes went 
into the character of this writer, who wanted success and was willing to 
compromise to achieve it." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips says he had been writing plays and film scripts long before he came to 
Los Angeles. He makes a point to explain that not all his scripts have roles 
for himself and none of them are typical mainstream Hollywood films. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up in the Texas independent film industry, where you don't write in car 
chases because you can't afford them." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was always committed to a career as an actor, Phillips says he 
wrote and produced plays throughout his high school and college days in Texas 
and after his graduation from the University of Texas at Arlington's drama 
department, he spent three years in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area writing and 
performing with a comedy troupe called "The Zero Hour." 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty much an uncensored 'Saturday Night Live.' We did some rude 
things, not all of which went over. We started in a punk club in 1980 -- an 
hour show at midnight -- then later made the rounds at other night clubs. This 
was my introduction into professional theater." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips began studying film technique with the man he describes as his mentor, 
Adam Roarke, an actor who has appeared in such films as "The Stunt Man" and 
"Play It as It Lays." Soon, Philips worked as an assistant director and 
instructor at Roarke's Film Actor's Lab. During this period, Phillips received 
his first screenwriting credit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on an independent film I'm not going to name because it's in video 
stores. A group had made a film in Texas that they hadn't been able to sell for 
two year. So they came to Adam and me. We had a reputation in Dallas as people 
who knew film -- and we were cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at this film and Adam asked if I could fix it. I spent a month 
studying the film, the script and outtakes. I rewrote 40 pages of dialogue and 
rerouted the plot. Then we reshot for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it a good film? No. But I'm proud that (the new footage) doesn't look like 
it was tacked on two years later. The plot works better and it was a wonderful 
lesson in screenplay structure for me. Also I achieved what I set out to do as 
a writer: We made a cohesive movie that the producers sold and got their money 
back." 
</P>
<P>
"La Bamba," of course, did make the kid from Texas a known entity. 
Writer-director Luis Valdez used the life story of the Chicano rock star to 
create one of the few positive images of Latinos in American films. Valdez and 
Phillips portrayed Valens as the boy next door who achieved success through 
spunk and ambition. Some critics found the film overly sentimental. But 
audiences responded and the film became a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, resulted in the flood of movie offers. "I pretty much 
approach acting as I do my writing." says Phillips. "I try not to do the same 
thing twice." 
</P>
<P>
Re-creating the role of Chavez Y Chavez for the "Young Guns" sequel was, in 
Phillips' mind, less of a repeat than a chance "to fix things I didn't like 
about the first film." In these two Brat Pack Westerns, Phillips found himself 
in the company of other young actors who face the pressures of early success. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in that fish bowl at a fairly early age carries certain baggage, either 
in the press's or the public's eye. I mean, whoever deserves to be as lucky as 
this? You can become extremely bitter about trying to prove something to 
somebody. So you do the best work you're capable of and hope that it speaks for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about choices and tenure. I don't think any of us have tenure yet. 
Certain guys establish themselves at the box office or establish themselves as 
artists beyond what the box office dictates. None of us are at that point. 
We're all working like maniacs but, personally speaking, I don't feel like I'm 
there yet. And maybe I never will be." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the sequel's enticements was a chance to recreate a role that 
Phillips says he likes more and more. "A lot of that has to do with my 
involvement with the Native American community. I'm Cherokee by blood but I've 
just been adopted by the Sioux tribe. On Labor Day, I'm going to the Pine Ridge 
Reservation in South Dakota for my naming ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
Philips, whose Sioux name is Star Keeper, is also organizing a benefit concert 
in Santa Fe this October, called "The Winds of Life," which he plans to emcee. 
The concert will benefit Native American causes. 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason for the Texas native's involvement in "Young Guns" was the 
simple fact that they were Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the most fun I will ever have on a film set," he says. "I was 
thrilled to death to be in a Western." 
</P>
<P>
During the shooting of a lynching scene for "Young Guns II," Phillips got more 
thrill than he bargained for. The scene called for Phillips' character to be 
saved from a lynching when Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) shot the rope in half 
just as he was about to be hanged. But when Estevez fired his gun, the horse 
beneath Phillips -- whose hands were bound behind him -- bolted. 
</P>
<P>
The rope around Phillips' neck snapped before it could do any damage, but the 
actor's foot got caught in the stirrups of the saddle and as he was being 
dragged alongside the spooked horse, his right forearm was shattered in four 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips holds the arm out at a right angle to his body. "It's not entirely 
straight," he says. "In softball the other day I hit one over the fence. But I 
can't throw yet. One nice thing about 'Mind Game' -- I don't have to break a 
sweat, I'm not beat up and I do no stunts. I'm playing a writer." 
</P>
<P>
"Mind Game" producer Richard E. Johnson admits that normally he would have 
"great trepidation" about producing a film whose star also functioned as the 
writer. "You might wind up with a vanity piece. But Lou is extremely 
level-headed and professional. He can really separate the functions. On the 
set, he responds like an actor, not a writer." 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most complex character he has done on screen," adds 
director Scott D. Goldstein. "Lou's using aspects of characters he's played 
before in films and molding them together into a new form." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips himself notes: "Usually, you do research to assume somebody else's 
personality. But I created this guy for me. I know what my motivations are." 
</P>
<P>
A smile crosses his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before this film began, I received a batch of rejection letters for a 
novel I've written. We got clearances to use the (publishers') letterheads for 
a scene where the character throws his rejection letters into a fire. Just 
before filming, I read over one letter and said, 'Guys, there's no question 
about my motivation for this scene. I know what it's about.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once "Mind Game" wraps, Phillips gets even busier. First on his schedule is 
"The Dark Wind" for executive producer Robert Redford and director Errol 
Morris. Phillips is negotiating to play mystery writer Tony Hillerman's 
American Indian detective, Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police. He then 
heads to Canada for "Agaguk," a film directed by Jacques Dorfman, which finds 
Phillips cast as -- yes, an Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got the script, I had to laugh. For years I've been saying, 'Hey, maybe 
one day I'll play an Eskimo.' Then here it is. But then I stopped and thought, 
Well, gee, who else are they going to send this to?"

BOB GELDOF

</HEADLINE>

<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twice nominated for a Nobel Prize and knighted by Queen Elizabeth for his work 
on behalf of African famine relief, Bob Geldof is the man who made charity work 
one of the pop trends of the '80s. Organizer of Band Aid (the first of rock's 
recent spate of large charity projects), Live Aid and Sport Aid, the 
38-year-old Irishman continues to work as chairman of the Live Aid 
organization, however, he's currently focusing his energies on launching his 
second solo album, "Vegetarians of Love." Featuring backing by the classical 
avant-garde outfit the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, the record marks a return to 
basics for Geldof -- it's a raucous collection of spontaneous first takes, 
acoustic instruments and folk idioms. (See review on Page 72.) Speaking by 
phone from the London home he shares with his wife and their two children, 
Geldof reflected on his charity work and the impact it's had on his career in 
music. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: Do you worry that your music is forever doomed to be evaluated within 
the context of your work as a social activist? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: It's probably true that even if I have 20 No. 1 hits, on the day I die 
they'll say, "He was a musician who did this thing called Live Aid." That's 
fine by me because politics have always played a role in my music and Band Aid 
was a perfect synthesis of the two things that have always interested me -- 
politics and music. Ultimately, however, I consider myself a musician, not a 
social activist, and people buy records simply on the basis of whether or not 
they like them. It doesn't really matter if critics pour their 
less-than-fabulous pearls of wisdom over my music on the basis of what I did 
with Band Aid. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Having traveled through famine-stricken areas of Africa and seen the things 
you've seen, did it feel frivolous to go into a studio and make a pop record? 
</P>
<P>
A: No -- and I realize some people find that odd. But for me, pop music is not 
trite or foolish and it's critical for me to do it. I got no sense of 
achievement or personal satisfaction whatsoever out of Band Aid, but I do feel 
a sense of achievement when I've written a decent song. In fact, that's the 
only way I experience that feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is pop music the appropriate context for social activism? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not necessarily, but then is sports, journalism or anything appropriate? Pop 
music can't change anything; however, it can focus attention on the problem. If 
you're talking about the big charity concerts, I do think they should stop 
doing that because it's a completely devalued currency at this point. For 
starters, there are only about 30 bands that can command world attention and 
I'm bored stupid seeing the same people all the time. It's also become a bit of 
a scam. When we did Band Aid it moved very fast and nobody had time to figure 
out how to exploit it. That's changed, and now everybody's figured out how to 
twist their bit of gold out of it. Everyone wants to be paid now -- the 
stadium, the lighting crew, etc. -- and that wasn't the case when we first did 
it. So many people get a slice of the pie now that a small amount of the profit 
actually goes to the organization ostensibly being benefited. So, if people 
want to help an organization, why don't they send a check directly to them? If 
they're so concerned, why do they have to get something back? 
</P>
<P>
Q: How seriously do people take messages and information that they get through 
pop music? 
</P>
<P>
A: I hope they don't take them seriously at all. In the words of Bob Dylan, who 
put it in perspective better than anybody before or since, don't follow 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is social activism just another image-enhancing mask pop performers are 
donning these days? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't think so. Most of the current English bands came out of punk, which 
was a politically conscious movement. Now . . . they can talk about things that 
have always concerned them, and though it initially appears ludicrous to see 
famous, wealthy people talk about these things, you must remember they were 
talking about this stuff when they were poor and unknown. Also, most of the pop 
stars involved with social activism are in their 30s and at that point in most 
people's lives, their view expands. They've established their careers and have 
families or settled relationships, so they're not quite so absorbed in getting 
their own lives sorted out. Perhaps for the first time, they're considering the 
world around them without seeing themselves as the center of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Many people consider you a heroic figure; who are your heroes? 
</P>
<P>
A: Samuel Pepys, who was a diarist who lived during the Reformation in England, 
which was a fantastic time to be alive. Sir Christopher Wren was building these 
wonderful buildings in Britain, Newton had just discovered gravity, the great 
fire of London and the bubonic plague happened, Shakespeare and John Donne were 
writing -- it was an incredible period, and Pepys wrote about it with great 
compassion and curiosity. Pepys lived at a fantastic time, but it's probably 
better to be alive now than at any point in history. The idea that every human 
has the right to pursue happiness is incredibly revolutionary, and in our part 
of the world it's more possible than ever to pursue that idea. Of course, 
two-thirds of the world are unable to pursue that dream, and that's the great 
problem now -- to find out how they can. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How did your work on behalf of famine relief affect your view of humanity? 
Do you find that people are basically good and will behave compassionately when 
given the opportunity, or must they be goaded into doing the right thing? 
</P>
<P>
A: Basically I've held the same view of people since I was very young and Live 
Aid didn't change it. I think people are basically good and I'm quite 
optimistic about the world -- which is why I would even attempt something like 
Live Aid. However, being Irish, I do have a highly developed sense of the 
ridiculous and I tend to see the absurdities of life -- and moral absurdities 
like starvation make me very angry. Anger and boredom are the primary 
motivations behind everything I do. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Throughout your career you've been highly critical of the British 
government; feeling as you do, what did it mean to you to be knighted? 
</P>
<P>
A: That was a symbolic gesture representing the fact that millions of people 
agreed with me on this one single issue. I never felt it was being given to Bob 
Geldof the person, and as the chairman of Live Aid, I accepted it politely. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the most widely held misconception about you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably the "Saint Bob" thing. When people approach me, the first thing 
they think is "Gee, he looks much taller than he does on telly." After that, I 
always see the disappointment clouding their eyes. I inevitably fail to live up 
to whatever they expect of me because expectations can never be lived up to. 
I've had no trouble reconciling myself to that because I've never been bothered 
about what people think. That's been the greatest asset and the greatest 
problem of my life. It allows me to do things I wouldn't do if I cared about 
people's opinions, but it also allows me to insult people -- which has never 
been my intention. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the most valuable thing you learned through your experience with Band 
Aid? 
</P>
<P>
A: That the individual is not powerless.

$25 GUIDE: A SONIC BOOM: GROUPS, DUOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Followers of the $25 Guide will notice that for the first time the Guide 
consists solely of groups or duos. So what's Emmylou Harris doing here? Her new 
album is a collection of duets. The Guide is a blueprint to keeping up with 
what's exciting in pop music on a budget of $25 a month (or $40 for compact 
disc buyers). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
July 
</P>
<P>
Sonic Youth's "Goo" (DGC Records) -- Have these artsy, guitar-worshipping, 
post-punk underground heroes sold their musical soul by moving up to the giant 
Geffen Records complex? A record as good-natured yet as relentlessly 
independent as "Goo" answers the question with a strong no. 
</P>
<P>
The Sundays' "Reading, Writing and Arithmetic" (DGC) -- This quartet was so 
highly touted in the British press after its 1988 debut single (included on the 
album) that it's a wonder it was able to maintain its innocent, understated, 
Cocteau Twins-influenced style and make an album as level-headed and as 
engaging as this. 
</P>
<P>
Tony! Toni! Tone's! "The Revival" (Wing) -- Tony! Toni! Tone! is part of an 
Oakland scene (along with the more rap-oriented Digital Underground) that is 
combining funk, rap and pop with a sense of celebration and imagination that 
recalls Bay Area pioneer Sly Stone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
August 
</P>
<P>
Emmylou Harris' "Duets" (Reprise) -- Most of these tracks have appeared on 
sound-track albums or on albums by other artists, but they are gathered 
together for the first time, and serve as testimony to the artistry and range 
of arguably the most satisfying female singer ever in country music. Among the 
memorable pairings: Gram Parsons, Roy Orbison, Neil Young and George Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Jones' "Liquidizer" (SBK) -- Among the marvelously eclectic influences 
cited in the album's liner notes -- if not always heard in the post-punk, 
psychedelic sound of this British band: the Byrds, Public Enemy, Sonny Boy 
Williamson, the Jungle Brothers and Faith No More. 
</P>
<P>
Was (Not Was)'s "Are You Okay?" (Chrysalis) -- In this album-of-the-year 
contender, David and Don Was also mix and match styles (rap, funk, rock and 
more) in a sometimes wild and wacky, sometimes purposeful look at American 
heroes, institutions and foibles.

FEMALE RAPPERS DISS AND TELL; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN, SPEARHEADED BY QUEEN LATIFAH, M.C. LYTE AND YO-YO, ARE DEMANDING TO JOIN 
THE MEN'S CLUB 
</P>

<P>
Yo-Yo doesn't strike one on first glance as a young woman who would swap 
insults with hard-core rapper Ice Cube on his volatile "AmeriKKKa's Most 
Wanted" album. 
</P>
<P>
The former Los Angeles school bus driver seems more like a cheerful, easygoing 
teen-age member of, say, the Whitney Houston fan club than an associate of one 
of America's most controversial pop figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget how I seem now," the 19-year-old said when she stopped by her manager's 
Crenshaw District office on a recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nice now, but I can be tough -- real tough when I have to be, when I have 
my rap face on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing her point, Yo-Yo -- whose real name is Yolanda Whitaker -- slowly 
replaced the smile on her face with an icy glare. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I wanted to be nice and smiling and soft I couldn't do that and be a 
rapper," said Yo-Yo, an East Los Angeles native. "I'd seem weak, and you can't 
look weak and survive -- not in rap. It's a jungle -- full of males. If you 
come across as weak, you get cut to ribbons." 
</P>
<P>
But even a tough demeanor would not have gained Yo-Yo, or any other woman, 
acceptance during the early years of the decade-old rap revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Rap was and in most ways remains a man's world. Nearly all of the field's 
creative personnel -- the rappers, producers, writers and musicians -- are men, 
making music geared mostly to black males in their teens and early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
This domination has resulted in rap's being a veritable men's locker room, a 
fraternity in which the initiation rites include "dissing" (putting down) 
women, often referring to them in foul, cruel gutter language. In rap songs, 
women are portrayed either as sex objects or gold diggers. There seems to be no 
in-between. 
</P>
<P>
But Yo-Yo is part of the new wave of female rappers -- including Queen Latifah 
and M. C. Lyte -- who have demanded the right to join the club. In some ways, 
their effort is a repeat of what female rockers went through in the '60s and 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
According to one rap artist's manager, the music's commercial success has 
finally led record companies, eagerly searching for new talent, to consider 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the record companies were just signing men," said Pat Charbonnet, 
executive vice president and co-owner of Street Knowledge Productions, which 
manages Ice Cube and Yo-Yo. "That's who they could make money on. Women didn't 
have much of a chance to get beyond the neighborhood rap scene then." 
</P>
<P>
But that's changing, she said. "As rap got bigger and started branching out in 
different directions, record companies saw they could make money off women 
rappers too. They see a market for them, so now they're signing them. If they 
had seen the market a few years ago, they would have started signing female 
rappers back then." 
</P>
<P>
Yo-Yo, however, believes the women's economic role in rap is secondary. More 
important, she said, is the healthy new perspective they bring to the music. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing men can't do is rap about things from a female point of view," she 
said. "What's happening now is that rap is growing to the point where more 
females are turning on to it. So there's an interest in the women's point of 
view." 
</P>
<P>
Any discussion of female rappers invariably begins with a question: How can 
women work in a field in which they are consistently attacked -- in which words 
such as bitch and 'ho (whore) are commonplace? It might be deemed degrading, 
tantamount to consorting with an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the female rappers interviewed, however, said they are not offended by 
the men's put-downs, which, they contend, are not as sexist as they seem on 
records. Those women simply chalk up the put-downs to male bluster. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just guys spouting off," said M. C. Lyte, who, along with Queen 
Latifah, is considered the best of the female rappers. "Some people call it 
sexist, and by some standards it is. But in the black community that's the way 
guys talk and, for the most part, that's what it is -- just a lot of talk." 
</P>
<P>
Queen Latifah agreed. "I'd be upset if I thought they were talking about all 
women or even about me," she said. "But a lot of what male rappers say is just 
their egos running wild. You can't take it all that seriously. But I'm sure 
most women would rather not hear that stuff at all. They'd rather hear nice 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Some female rappers don't take the dissing so lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"Some raps really dog (downgrade) women in a horrible way," Yo-Yo said, 
declining to name culprits. "Those guys can really make you mad. If they're 
just exaggerating and telling funny stories, that's OK. But some go way 
overboard." 
</P>
<P>
Tairrie B, a white Los Angeles rapper whose debut album, "The Power of a 
Woman," was just released by MCA, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys can be so childish and mean," she said angrily. "They don't have to talk 
about women like we were tramps who were only good for sex. What if women 
talked about men like they were dogs, would the males like it? Hell no!" 
</P>
<P>
Though the outspoken Tairrie B, 25, takes some swats at men in her album, most 
female rappers avoid such attacks, fearing commercial backlash, Charbonnet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Would the rap audience accept it?" she asked rhetorically. "Probably not. If 
the woman rapper had great beats and great delivery, there's an outside chance 
the rap audience might accept it. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's very risky putting too much of something like that on record. Also, 
the male producers and writers who dominate the business aren't going to write 
a whole lot of that kind of stuff for women rappers." 
</P>
<P>
Like men, young women often turn on to rap because it permeates their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Yo-Yo, for instance, built a solid reputation as a rapper in South- Central Los 
Angeles before being discovered by Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
"In the black neighborhood, rapping is like breathing," she said. "I started 
rapping when I was 12. I got to be pretty good -- better than the guys. Even 
Ice Cube saw that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Yo-Yo made such an impression on Ice Cube, who was with N.W.A. before 
embarking on a solo career late last year, that he co-wrote and co-produced her 
debut album, which is scheduled for an October release. He also asked her to 
rap on his "It's a Man World," the cut that introduced her to the national rap 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Ice Cube met Yo-Yo, who'd been rapping in the South-Central area, at a swap 
meet last summer. Through a friend, he'd heard about her rapping skills. He 
immediately invited Yo-Yo to his studio to do some demos, which he liked. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked her attitude," he said. "She had this I-don't-give-a-damn attitude. 
She wasn't acting like a groupie, saying, 'Oh Ice Cube this' or 'Oh Ice Cube 
that.' If she had acted like that I wouldn't have nothing to do with her. 
</P>
<P>
"In the studio, I liked her delivery, which is the most important thing in rap. 
Plus she wrote her own raps -- good raps. That impressed me too. I'd never 
dealt with a girl rapper before. But she was good enough to make me decide to 
give it a try working with a girl rapper." 
</P>
<P>
D. J. Spinderella, a member of Salt 'n' Pepa, one of the first commercially 
accepted female rap groups, said that the music plays a vital role in the lives 
of black youth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the sound of the black community," Spinderella said in a recent 
interview. "You can't escape it. Love it or hate it, it's there. Females in 
black neighborhoods rap too -- because everybody else does it." 
</P>
<P>
That neighborhood influence prompted Queen Latifah, 20, of Newark, N.J., to 
venture into rap. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something to do that was fun," she recalled. "I got more serious about 
it when people started telling me I was good at it. I started writing my own 
rhymes. I started playing talent shows and parties. Then some people at Tommy 
Boy Records heard my demo, and I got a record deal." 
</P>
<P>
Latifah's trademark is her regal African attire and majestic presence. She 
forgoes cussing and dissing, but does her share of boasting. 
</P>
<P>
A rapper for six years, 19-year-old M. C. Lyte, a poised, confident young woman 
from Brooklyn, has been a professional for only three years. "Getting into rap 
was easy for me," she said. "There weren't many women in rap. I started writing 
rhymes in high school. They were good enough to inspire me to follow through 
with rap." 
</P>
<P>
These are all black rappers. What's it like for white female rappers? 
</P>
<P>
"My story is simple," said Tairrie B, who's from San Fernando. "I got into rap 
about three years ago because I liked it and I thought I could do it. People 
said, 'You don't sound black enough.' But I didn't let that stop me. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding a style was real hard. First I copied people, but that was all wrong. 
I was afraid to be myself, to sound white. But finally I had to be myself or 
the raps would sound fake. I get across that I'm strong and independent -- and 
not weak." 
</P>
<P>
Roxanne Shante was an early influence on many of today's female rappers. Known 
for her aggressive boasting and raunchy raps, she rumbled out of the New York 
underground in early 1985. 
</P>
<P>
At 14, the Long Island native became a minor sensation in rap for her searing 
"Roxanne's Revenge," the best and most acidic answer record that year to UTFO's 
sexist "Roxanne, Roxanne." Her biggest asset is not her delivery or beats, but 
her lewd sense of humor, reflecting the strong influence of R&amp;B 
comedian/singer Millie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a real trailblazer in women's rap," said Charbonnet, of Street 
Knowledge Productions. "Rappers like J. J. Fad and Salt 'n' Pepa were doing 
raps that were commercial, that could be played on radio. Roxanne was 
underground, she had the respect of the rap community -- probably the first 
woman rapper who did." 
</P>
<P>
There are now more than a dozen female rappers who have contracts with major 
labels, including reggae rapper Shelly Thunder, Oaktown 3-5-7 and Ms. Melodie. 
</P>
<P>
The trend is toward tougher and more aggressive raps than those of early female 
rap successes J. J. Fad and Salt 'n' Pepa. The usual boasting and put-downs are 
handled with considerably more authority and variety by today's female rappers, 
and now there's a stronger feminist sense. 
</P>
<P>
An excerpt from Queen Latifah's single "Ladies First" reflects the tougher tone 
of female raps: 
</P>
<P>
 Strong stepping strutting moving on 
</P>
<P>
Rhyming cutting but not forgetting 
</P>
<P>
We are the ones to give birth 
</P>
<P>
To the new generation of prophets 
</P>
<P>
Cause it's ladies first 
</P>
<P>
I break into lyrical freestyle 
</P>
<P>
Grab the mike, look at the crowd and see the smiles 
</P>
<P>
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the women tend to be more tame than the men, whose raps are often 
searing, fanciful tales depicting the rappers as playboys and adventurers -- 
the heroes of the black ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do all that the men rappers can do, " said M. C. Lyte, who does her 
share of boasting and dissing on her two albums, "Lyte as a Rock" and "Eyes on 
This." "Some of it wouldn't come across right. We can boast, but we can't 
overdo it because we're women, and the audience won't accept some things from 
women that they'll accept from men." 
</P>
<P>
Lyte's raps most closely resemble those of the male rappers. "I Cram to 
Understand U" is the hard-hitting tale of a woman in love with a crack addict. 
Her current "Eyes on This" album includes "Cappuccino" and "Not Wit' a Dealer," 
somber tales about the evils of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte also swears more than the other women. "I think that's why the rap 
audience likes me," Lyte said. "I don't try to copy men. But I do have this 
tough attitude. I won't take anything from anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Salt 'n' Pepa's D. J. Spinderella has a softer approach. "Think of the image 
men have of women," she said. "They like them to be nice and a bit sexy -- but 
nothing extreme. They don't want some foul-mouthed women cussing at them. Can 
women rappers do a lot of swearing and be accepted? They can't really -- not 
now anyway. Most women just don't like to do heavy swearing. Not too many women 
swear like the males do." 
</P>
<P>
Of the recent records by female rappers, Yo-Yo's upcoming album may be most 
likely to create a stir. Co-produced and co-written by Ice Cube, it offers 
uncompromising put-downs of men and some X-rated language. 
</P>
<P>
But Yo-Yo insisted that she's not a foul-mouthed, female version of 2 Live 
Crew. "I can say a curse word to express myself up to a point," she said. "I 
can do some swearing, but on a low level. I wouldn't use some of the words the 
male rappers use. I don't want to get too nasty." 
</P>
<P>
She concluded: "What I want my record to do is push women rappers up the ladder 
even closer to men. We've got some catching up to do, some more barriers to 
break down, some more minds to change. And we're doing it -- fast."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WHAT AM I DOING HERE BY BRUCE CHATWIN (PENGUIN: $9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last book by the author of "In Patagonia" and "The Songlines" is a 
collection of miscellaneous short pieces. Bruce Chatwin's profiles have a 
vitality that conveys the personality of the subjects, particularly the 
interview with the aged Madeleine Vionnet. 
</P>
<P>
But the essays on the visual arts lack the spontaneous ease of his other 
writing; Chatwin seems unsure of himself and nervously documents every 
assertion he makes. The sections on travel showcase the writer at his best, 
capturing the essence of a family dinner in Yunan or life in a small village in 
Tibet (where he investigates the rumors of Yeti) in a few well-chosen words. A 
trip down the Volga with a group of German veterans culminates at Stalingrad, 
with the lugubrious spectacle of former enemies mourning their dead. Chatwin 
died in 1989 at age 47, of a rare disease he contracted in Asia, and the art of 
travel writing is the poorer for his passing.

<P>
The road to Avalon, on the edge of sprawling Soweto, ends at a haunting field, 
an incongruous and lonely break from the surrounding slum. At dusk, the vast 
expanse appears to be a no-man's land of wild waist-high grass and weeds. While 
the rest of the black township outside Johannesburg bustles noisily with 
numbers it can no longer contain, the only sound across the unkempt Avalon 
field is the echo of dogs barking in the distance. It is an anonymous monument 
to recent South African history. 
</P>
<P>
I had come to Avalon to look for Hector Peterson, the black youth who 
symbolized the turbulent years I had spent in South Africa as a journalist 
covering the first nationwide black uprising in the 1970s. Dubbed the 
"children's crusade," the violence had lasted 16 months, ending only after at 
least 570 had died, 3,900 had been injured and 5,900 had been detained. 
Returning to South Africa this year, exactly a decade after I'd left, I made a 
pilgrimage to find Peterson, just as I had done on every anniversary of the 
uprising while I lived there. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon is a blacks-only cemetery. And Hector Peterson's grave is its most noted 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson died on June 16, 1976. Like thousands of other students, he had left 
class to join a peaceful march against the imposition of Afrikaans, the 
language of early Dutch settlers, on black schools. The protest quickly turned 
into a confrontation with South African police as students hurled rocks and 
police responded with rifles. Peterson, age 13, was the first to die. He was 
shot in the back. At the time, his death captivated the world. A photograph of 
his limp, bloody body being carried away by another young black, Peterson's 
screaming sister Antoinette running alongside, made the front pages of papers 
around the world -- and eventually the walls of the United Nations. A single 
picture symbolized the frustration and rage spawned by repression -- and the 
price children had to pay to stand up against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't seen Hector Peterson die, but I had been in Soweto that day and 
throughout the uprising. What none of us knew back then was that his death 
would mark a cataclysmic turning point for the last bastion of white minority 
rule in Africa. A new generation of young blacks assumed the mantle of 
leadership and escalated opposition from pockets of sporadic resistance to a 
mass movement constantly challenging, and eroding, white rule. The uprising 
would eventually lead, on an uneven course, to the sweeping changes pledged by 
the government this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing the three people in that picture became the first leg of a personal 
journey into the past I had witnessed. I needed to understand what had happened 
in the volatile interim in order to understand what lies ahead. Armed with an 
anxious curiosity and a passion for a bountifully lush country, I wasn't sure 
what to expect. After living and working there for five years, I had left South 
Africa angry, not only at the inequality among races, but also at the 
indignities one set of men could heap on another simply because of the color of 
their skin. Ten years later, I didn't think I could stand to be disappointed 
again. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, it was a joyous trip. Some things had changed more than I had 
anticipated they would in my lifetime. A minority of blacks and whites have 
begun to cross the long bridge that has separated them from the moment of birth 
in segregated clinics to burial in segregated cemeteries. In other ways it was 
gut-wrenching. Dismantling apartheid, I discovered, is going to be a 
tumultuous, painful exercise in healing the scars and fears of the past. The 
majority of whites, who have paid psychologically for their financial and 
political dominance, live in a state of anxious aprehension about the price 
they may have to pay for four decades of apartheid. And the majority of blacks, 
including another generation of children, have suffered in squalor -- walking 
miles daily to get water from public taps, waiting for places in overcrowded 
schools and even turning to crime to ease their poverty -- as the nation groped 
slowly for a formula to share power. Despite the crumbling of legal barriers, 
most blacks and whites are still a color apart. 
</P>
<P>
The entrance to Avalon today looks almost respectable. The rough old track has 
been widened and paved. Beyond a new brick archway, the road is lined with 
yellow daisies stretching high toward the blazing South African sun. But 
inside, little has changed, except the size. Once the equivalent of a couple of 
football fields, the massive blocks of untended plots had grown so big that I 
had to ask a black gravedigger to locate Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"No, you'd never find it now," he said dourly. He got into my car and we drove 
over the weather-gutted lanes of red clay, then walked through the underbrush 
to the 1976 sector. Then he stopped. "There," he pointed to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Since I had left, the small cross that marked Peterson's grave had been 
replaced by a proper headstone. But late last year, the large slab of marble 
had been smashed. No one was sure who had vandalized the site. But local 
consensus blamed a group of whites spotted near the sector that day; not many 
whites visit Avalon. The pieces, at least, were still in order, and I could see 
the inscription chiseled into the black marble. "Time is on the side of the 
oppressed," it read. "Truth is on the side of the oppressed." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's epitaph was an angrier version of another warning issued 30 years 
earlier. On February 3, 1960, British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan had stood 
before the South African Parliament in Cape Town to herald "the wind of change 
blowing through the continent" -- and to give notice that Britain could no 
longer support white domination. It was a watershed speech that signaled the 
impending end of Africa's colonial era. Since then, 40 African nations have 
gained independence from colonial masters, foreign mandates and other forms of 
white minority rule. South Africa, however, chose to ignore the message. 
</P>
<P>
The delay has been costly. Vast numbers of a generation -- the most politicized 
in the nation's history -- have been lost, dispersed or silenced. 
</P>
<P>
Mbuyisa Makhubu, the 18-year-old in denim overalls who scooped up Peterson, the 
young stranger crumpled at his feet, was among the dispersed. Eyewitnesses said 
that Makhubu had been visiting friends when he heard the initial outburst and 
went to see what was happening. Although he didn't know Peterson, Makhubu raced 
the boy to a clinic where he was pronounced dead. Police searched for Makhubu 
after the world-famous photograph was published; they told his family that he 
had posed for the picture. From then on, Makhubu moved constantly for almost 
three months until he fled, first to Botswana and then Nigeria. Exile was 
preferable to detention. Makhubu's family has not heard of him for more than a 
decade. An international organization tried for two years to track him down, 
but failed. Several accounts suggest that he has died. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, at least 10,000 South Africans have also slipped into exile. Many 
trained as guerrillas. Others studied. Some just drifted. Another 58,000 of all 
races have been silenced in open-ended detention, according to the Human Rights 
Commission. Most have been black. 
</P>
<P>
And even detention could be dangerous: 52 blacks died in police custody. One 
detainee died after allegedly slipping on a bar of soap, another after 
allegedly falling off an upper-level floor ledge, though it was later noted 
that the floor had no ledge, and a third after supposedly hitting his head 
repeatedly against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
South African security forces had managed to quell the initial uprising through 
intimidation and force. But by the mid-1980s, the country was again ready to 
explode. When the government introduced a new tri-cameral parliament in 1984 
that brought in Indians and Coloreds but excluded blacks, it did. Black rent 
increases and protests over inferior black education further fueled the second 
round of nationwide riots and strikes. By 1985, unrest was so widespread that 
the government even banned outdoor funerals of "people who died of unnatural 
causes" -- a euphemism for victims of the violence. Mourning the dead, the last 
remaining public forum for dissent, became illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, black bitterness has welled up and hardened. 
</P>
<P>
The only member of the trio left in South Africa is Hector Peterson's sister 
Antoinette, known as Toto to her friends. She was a cherubic and chubby 16 when 
her brother died. Now 30, she is a matronly plump mother of two boys. With the 
help of a black journalist, I found her living in relative obscurity in Soweto. 
Since the uprising and the photograph and the two weeks of police 
interrogations that followed, she has stayed away from politics. But she hasn't 
forgotten. Her elder son, now 8, is named Hector. 
</P>
<P>
Toto represents the future -- and the pivotal question facing South African 
blacks: Can hope and change overcome the scars? 
</P>
<P>
"I relive a bit of that day every day," Toto told me in a whisper-soft voice. 
Without prompting, she went on: "We were at different schools, so it was God's 
miracle that we met on the street. I had him by the hand and we were hiding. 
The police had released dogs and they were beating students with batons. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Stay with me, it looks dangerous.' But he saw the students marching 
and wanted to go with them. A few minutes later I saw a group of boys crowding 
around something and Hector's shoe was on the ground." Then she paused. "I 
thought he was still beside me. 
</P>
<P>
"He was my only brother, and I miss him." 
</P>
<P>
She later reflected, "Can I forgive? I don't know. I can't say yes because when 
I think back, all the hatred also comes back. But I may be less bitter about my 
brother's death now because of the changes here." 
</P>
<P>
"Modified concentration camps" was the way a visiting U.S. assistant secretary 
for Housing and Urban Development described Soweto and other black townships 
before the 1976 riots. The 26 suburbs of the South West Townships -- a name 
shortened into Soweto -- were then an eyesore of gloomy brick matchbox homes, 
each few blocks identical, lined up on treeless roads or dirt paths. Blacks had 
no choice about where they lived; the government assigned rental homes in 
designated townships. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, I used to photograph life in Soweto. The images are still stark in 
my mind: women "shopping" at scraggly traffic islands, where used clothing was 
laid out on sheets on the ground. Men nearby sitting on cans to have their hair 
cut by outdoor barbers. Little girls doing wash in large tin tubs in back yards 
or near communal water outlets. A gaggle of boys pushing toy cars, ingeniously 
fashioned from coat-hanger wire, in mock derbies down worn roads. A man 
wrestling to hold on to two live chickens he bought from a street vendor. 
</P>
<P>
Soweto then had only one phone for every 27,000 and a single hospital for a 
million-plus inhabitants. About one-third of its homes had electricity, and 
even fewer had indoor plumbing. The township had only two banks, two movie 
houses -- limited to showing movies cleared by censors -- and no supermarket. 
Most people spent evenings by candlelight or oil lamps; the coal stoves they 
used for heat and cooking left the rippling hills covered with an odorous smog. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Soweto, back then, was considered South Africa's "showcase" black township. 
The government even offered tours to show how well blacks lived. Most other 
areas were far worse. The uprising, however, produced unprecedented new 
pressure -- and gradual changes. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Toto lives with her second husband, Meshack Sithole, in the Dobsonville 
"extension," one of the new subdivisions added to Soweto since the uprising. 
Miles of pastel bungalows with sweet little gardens now surround old 
Dobsonville and the ugly core of Soweto. It's as if a little bit of heaven has 
been built on the outskirts of hell. 
</P>
<P>
Toto's home is pale-pink stucco with a rose-tiled roof. She has a telephone, 
electricity, running water -- "cold and hot," she likes to point out -- and 
toilets. She doesn't have a washing machine, but she does have a bathtub to 
clean the family's clothes indoors. The Sitholes took out a mortgage on the 
house on Ramatlotlo Road for $13,200 in 1987; they also have a 99-year 
leasehold on the land, a change introduced in 1983. A series of government 
moves between 1986 and 1988 now allows blacks to buy land outright, although 
few can afford the high prices. 
</P>
<P>
Both Toto and Meshack hold jobs that, in 1976, were restricted to whites under 
various "job reservation" acts, laws that were repealed in phases between 1979 
and 1987. Toto is now a clerk for an encyclopedia publisher. Meshack is a 
warehouse manager for an automotive parts company; he is the first black to 
hold the position. 
</P>
<P>
The new opportunities for blacks were created by a confluence of factors: Black 
boycotts and sporadic violence that occasionally spilled over into white areas 
forced both local and foreign corporations to recognize that they could not 
survive if black living and working conditions did not improve. Local and 
international political pressure, along with the high black birth rate that 
made whites an even smaller minority, forced the government to accept gradual 
change for a population it could no longer control -- even with brute force. 
And black consciousness blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some aspects of Soweto life have improved. Blacks no longer have 
to buy live chickens from street vendors. Big Daddy's Famous Speedchicken 
rivals a chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets. And shopping is no longer 
limited to traffic circles or small shops. Maponya's giant Discount Store has 
made its owner a millionaire and breeder of racehorses. Barbers still have 
open-air stands, but hair salons also now coif the hair of men and women. 
Little boys still play with their wire cars, but Sowetans prefer to boast of 
the two real Rolls-Royces owned by blacks in the wealthier township 
subdivisions, such as the one called Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Toto credits the movement symbolized by her brother's death for the changes in 
her life and others'. "His death helped make life better for me," she said, 
nodding. "Whites, at least some whites, began to notice our situation. And the 
government began doing things, some small things, about the way we lived." 
</P>
<P>
But, like Avalon, only parts of Soweto have a respectable veneer. 
</P>
<P>
When the government restricted the press from Soweto in 1976, I used to do 
on-camera commentaries in front of the township's one quasi-luxury: an 
overgrown three-hole golf course on the border. Today, the golf course is home 
to 50,000 people, one of five Soweto squatter camps of shanties fashioned from 
old cardboard, corrugated tin and weathered plastics. The shacks are crammed 
together so tightly it's hard to tell where one ends and the next begins. 
Nationwide, 2.5 million are squatters or homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Soweto, with a population that has at least doubled and perhaps quadrupled 
since 1976, is bursting at the seams, often forcing several generations to live 
together. In Soweto's Jabulani district, the Dhlamini family has 32 children 
living in one of the old four-room matchbox houses. Ranging in age from 8 
months to 18 years, they sleep on the floor, in the kitchen, on any scrap of 
furniture, all woven together like worms. The standard of misery for countless 
blacks is even worse than when I was last in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The government had tried to control the numbers in the "townships" -- the name 
whites give all-black suburbs -- with "influx control" restrictions stipulating 
that only blacks with jobs in white cities or farms could live outside the 10 
tribal homelands. When the laws were repealed in 1986, tens of thousands 
flocked to townships like Soweto in search of better-paying jobs -- or, in 
fact, any job. Black unemployment has become chronic, up to an estimated 60% in 
the worst areas. And even for those with jobs the black per-capita income has 
been more than halved, from $1,460 in 1976 to only $548. The plummeting value 
of the Rand, the South African currency, and the black-population surge mean 
that dwindling wealth has to be divided among even more people. 
</P>
<P>
Education, the issue that ignited the uprising, is also straining under the 
migration and population pressures. In 1976, Soweto had 42 high schools; today 
it has 67, but 150,000 children are still without schools, according to black 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Soweto remains the "showcase" township. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more critical to the future than the political and economic disparities 
is the deep cleavage between the races. It extends well beyond the first 
generation that went to prison for championing black rights and the second 
generation that fought street battles to achieve them. 
</P>
<P>
As I got up to leave Toto's house I stuck out my arm to shake hands with her 
sons. Hector, a slim, long-legged child who favors Mickey Mouse T-shirts, shyly 
gave me his hand. But his 2-year-old brother Sylvester pulled away and started 
to squeal. Toto smiled. "It's nothing personal," she said. "It's just that the 
only whites he has ever seen are doctors, and he associates them with pain.' 
</P>
<P>
The child's response was eerily familiar. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, I had visited a black school in Mamelodi, a Pretoria 
township, with Jacquie Myburgh, an angel-faced Afrikaner child with a long 
brown braid, and her mother. As we pulled up to the school's front door, the 
students, who had watched us approach from the window, stampeded outside. We 
instinctively rolled up the windows and locked the doors. For several minutes, 
dozens of children, age 7 to 12, pressed their faces and fingers hard against 
the windows, trapping us in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a black teacher waded through the crowd and tapped on the window. "Not 
to worry," she said with a knowing smile. "They don't want to hurt you. It's 
just that they've never seen a white child before." The desperate fascination 
of those children had remained locked in my memory because it so succinctly 
defined the absurdity and perversity of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
It was, of course, only one of dozens of examples. When I lived in South 
Africa, local newspaper accounts often bordered on the bizarre: There were 
regular reports of twins classified as different races and forced to live apart 
because of varying skin hues. One of the craziest stories involved a skull that 
had washed up on the southern shore. When forensic tests couldn't determine its 
race, a local magistrate rented a refrigerator to store it; the government 
didn't want it buried in the wrong racial cemetery. One of the most sensational 
scandals involved a white dominie, pastor of the Afrikaners' Dutch Reformed 
Church, who fathered a Colored child by a black mistress he couldn't legally 
marry. The scandal, in the eyes of his strict Calvinist faith, was 
miscegenation; the real tragedy was that, by law, all three had to live in 
separate areas. 
</P>
<P>
I had to track down Jacquie Myburgh and her family to find out more about what 
had happened to racial interaction. 
</P>
<P>
Like Toto, Jacquie had grown up with the crisis dating back to the uprising. 
And, as a descendant of the first white settlers, she represents the pivotal 
question for South African whites: Can hope and change overcome the fears? 
</P>
<P>
Jacquie has grown into a stunning 22-year-old with big brown eyes. While her 
mother remembered the incident in Mamelodi, Jacquie didn't. Her only memory was 
of making thick peanut-butter sandwiches to take to black children in the 
townships. But the fact that she couldn't remember may reflect the difference 
between generations and the context of their lives. Jacquie now coexists with 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Today she is an environmental reporter for the Johannesburg Star. She sits next 
to a black reporter. One of her editors is black. She was recently approached 
by a famed local black saxophone player, who asked her to translate his 
autobiography into Afrikaans -- the language that sparked the uprising -- so it 
would be available to whites. She has also begun socializing with a multiracial 
group of young professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of a person's color anymore," she said with just a trace of the 
accent that distinguishes Afrikaners from English-speaking whites. "The whole 
idea is ridiculous when you think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really quite excited about bringing up children here. I'm not scared of 
the future at all. I think it's going to be marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Afrikaners have been more conservative than English-speaking 
whites. They tended to hold the lower-class and rural jobs; they had also 
settled in South Africa two centuries before most English arrived and fought 
blacks to gain control of the land. Their fears were evident when the 
Afrikaner-dominated National Party won power in 1948 and later introduced the 
concept of apartheid. In the past, most scenarios of the country's future 
portrayed Afrikaners as the last hold-outs, rebuilding the lagers, the circling 
of the wagons of early settlers, to prevent sharing power with blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's true anymore," Jacquie said with a chuckle. "I think we 
will adapt better. We have a longer attachment to this country. Our past is 
here and so is our future." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the framework for the future is already here. Jacquie works on 
Sauer Street in downtown Johannesburg, just around the corner from my old 
office and only three miles from where I used to live. In 1975, I had an 
apartment in Hillbrow, Johannesburg's equivalent of Greenwich Village, a place 
that buzzed with eclectic shops and cafes. It was legally -- and distinctly -- 
white. Most blacks who worked downtown were cleaners, gofers or laborers who 
took trains back to Soweto at night. 
</P>
<P>
But, now, most of the tenants in my old block are black. So are the majority of 
shoppers and the sales personnel in the stores. In the decade since I left, 
downtown Johannesburg has effectively changed color, opening up to all races 
because there was, simply, no alternative. By the mid-1980s, the growth of the 
black population -- conservatively estimated at about 3%, almost twice the 
white birth rate -- created an unprecedented housing shortage. And the 
expanding black middle class began to have the means to pay more. The lifting 
in 1986 of the "pass" laws, which had required blacks to have special papers to 
get out of the townships, allowed freer movement. And the repeal of 
restrictions on whites-only parks, restaurants, cinemas and other public 
facilities changed the climate. 
</P>
<P>
Like many aspects of life in South Africa on the eve of transition, the line 
between legalities and realities is still sometimes fuzzy. Blacks who have 
moved into Hillbrow high-rises are breaking the law. But apartheid is now too 
costly to enforce, so the government has chosen to ignore hundreds of 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The metamorphosis was vividly evident when I went to check out the Diplomat 
Hotel on Plein Street. In the 1970s, the Diplomat had a legendary bar, a 
males-only hangout frequented by white mercenaries and assorted cohorts in 
between jobs. During the wars in Angola, Rhodesia and Zaire's Shaba, I often 
tried to get in to find out about the mercenaries' misadventures and future 
plans. But I always ended up having to summon the bartender outside to have him 
relay messages or to convince one of the men to come out and talk. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Diplomat's sidewalk billboard boasts: "Exotic Dancers -- Best Girls 
in Town." The bar throbs in the afternoons with disco or rock as strobe lights 
flash against the dark walls and showgirls fulfill their billing. At tables 
around the dance floor, female "escorts," mostly black, are snuggled 
elbow-to-elbow with "clients," usually white. This time, someone shouted for me 
to come on in. 
</P>
<P>
Interracial socializing, relationships and even prostitution are now tolerated, 
albeit reluctantly, by the government. And the law proscribing mixed marriages 
was repealed in 1985. But, again, there is a fuzziness that shows how very far 
South Africa still has to go. Among the once-dizzying set of laws still on the 
books and erratically enforced is the Group Areas Act, which segregates the 
races into their own living areas. So blacks and whites and Coloreds and Asians 
can now have intercourse and intermarry, but they still can't legally live 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Jacquie Myburgh's optimism that the fuzziness will all eventually be sorted out 
is not universally shared. The white flight, which began after the 1976 
uprising, is once again a subject of intense speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"From the readers' letters we get, you can see that 90% (of whites) are nervous 
about change," commented Tertius Myburgh, Jacquie's father and the editor of 
The Sunday Times, one of the largest English-language weeklies. "A great 
majority of the South African population is walking around in bewilderment." 
</P>
<P>
The black move into the city was in part triggered by the exodus of thousands 
of whites to starched-white enclaves in northern Johannesburg. Although many 
still work downtown, they don't want to live there -- because of the black 
encroachment, the feared loss of real estate values or the growing crime. "I 
have a contest with my driver on the way home every night to see who spots the 
first white," Myburgh joked. "It's usually in Bramfontein," the dividing line 
between downtown and the white suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
More telling, perhaps, is that more than 165,000 whites have left the country 
since the uprising. The trend first became noticeable in 1977, when white 
emigrants outnumbered immigrants for the first time in almost two decades. A 
poll of white students that year revealed that 65% planned to leave. Talk at 
cocktail parties reflected the tension. I heard endless conversations among 
women about what kinds of jewelry and antiques would beat restrictions on cash 
taken out of the country; among men, it was new or antique cars. Discussions 
often ended with ratings of kennels, and which was the best for pets to be left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Party talk hasn't changed much. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most common questions at parties these days is 'Where are your 
children?' " Tertius Myburgh lamented. "One of the great tragedies is that so 
many of the next generation of whites are in California or Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"People are often surprised when we tell them that all three of our kids are 
here, that all three are aggressive about staying." 
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, the British Embassy is reportedly now issuing 2,000 passports each 
month for South Africans of English heritage. The British Foreign Office has 
disclosed that as many as a million whites qualify for citizenship. The U.S., 
Australian, Canadian and other embassies have been flooded with queries about 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
But many Afrikaners fearful of the future are either ineligible for citizenship 
elsewhere or can't afford to leave. Some have chosen to join the growing 
hard-line opposition, ranging from the Conservative Party to assorted neo-Nazi 
groups, to resist change. Others are just drifting. For both groups, the sense 
of betrayal -- that a fellow Afrikaner, President F. W. de Klerk, is giving 
away what generations fought to establish -- is deep. 
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, I ran into one of the disillusioned. As I searched for a parking 
slot, I saw a bearded, unkempt white man motioning madly. He was standing in 
front of an open space. Like two blacks also working the same block, he sought 
tips for pointing out space in metered zones. When I left South Africa, no race 
was allowed to work the streets, and white panhandling was unheard of -- 
especially in the ultraconservative capital. 
</P>
<P>
As I got out, he offered to wash my spanking-clean rental car. Kirk, a 
39-year-old Afrikaner, turned out to be a former railway shunter laid off last 
year. He had to give up his apartment and move in with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"The way things are going, there aren't many jobs for me anymore," he 
complained. "Whites no longer have guarantees, and it's cheaper to hire blacks. 
Everyone wants to hire blacks now." 
</P>
<P>
When I asked what he thought of the promised reforms, he looked at me as if I 
were crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"What future do I have now?" he said with an angry scowl. "Whites are finished 
here. And what country is going to let me in? My family has been here for 300 
years." His despondency about the future was as intense as Jacquie Myburgh's 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In the decade since I'd left, whites had also been thoroughly politicized and 
their lives radically changed. There were, as I discovered, no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
During my last four years in South Africa, Roland Hunter, his parents and his 
three little sisters were my neighbors in Forest Town, a sleepy Johannesburg 
suburb of white-washed homes and cottages. The Hunters were the ordinary, nice 
family next door. Roland's father, Peter, who finished his doctorate in 
education at UCLA, was a respected university administrator. Lucienne, his 
mother, had an uproarious giggle that broke the tension of any crisis. The 
girls were sweet and spirited. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I saw Roland, he was a 22-year-old economics student, a 
wholesomely good-looking kid just growing out of lanky adolescence. It was 
March, 1980, and I had gone next door to ask if I could use the Hunters' tennis 
court. "Sure," Roland had smiled. He didn't make much use of the tennis court 
back then. 
</P>
<P>
I had no intention of including the Hunters in this story, but I couldn't leave 
South Africa without checking on them. I knew the odds that they would still be 
there were small, but, when I dropped by unannounced, I saw Lucienne through 
the window. 
</P>
<P>
After a big bear hug, she wanted to hear about my wanderings and my writing. I 
then asked about news of the family, suspecting that their quiet lives would be 
the one constant in the overwhelming change around me. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we have a bit of news, too," she said in what turned out to be the 
understatement of my missing decade. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Roland had finished a five-year sentence at Pretoria Central 
Prison. "Technically," Lucienne explained. "He should have gotten 25 years to 
life. That's the mandatory term for high treason." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most damaging espionage cases in the country's history, Hunter 
had stolen what the press later called a "trunk load" of South African military 
secrets. The documents revealed the country's deepest covert operation: plans 
to destabilize or help overthrow the governments in four neighboring black 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter had never before been politically active, and the most telling aspect of 
his saga of intrigue and espionage was that it was not premeditated. "It was an 
amateur operation really," Roland said with a chuckle when I caught up with him 
later. "I didn't really know what I was doing. I wanted to be a lecturer, not a 
spy." 
</P>
<P>
The turning point was in 1982, when he was drafted. Assigned to the Directorate 
of Special Tasks, he quickly learned he was in the midst of the army's "dirty 
tricks" unit, which ran operations against Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe and 
Lesotho. His job included handling all the paper work for Operation Mila, a 
campaign to overthrow the Mozambique government. Hunter was only supposed to 
file the secret folders. Instead, he copied the documents. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a moral decision or dilemma. There was no anguish," he said. Once he 
read the documents, "what I had to do suddenly became clear, clear, clear." The 
operation finally gave Hunter a reason to use the tennis court, where, after 
carefully wrapping the papers in double plastic bags to avoid water damage, he 
buried them. Every month for almost a year, he handed over a new set of files 
to a white couple who provided a link to the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Despite several close calls, Hunter almost got away with it. Then, eight days 
before he finished his army stint, he was arrested for treason and held 
incommunicado for several months. The government was eventually forced to 
reduce the charges against him to avoid a public trial and exposure of other 
secret documents whose numbers Hunter had memorized. At an in-camera trial, 
which even his family couldn't attend, he was sentenced to five years. In 1984, 
Roland Hunter went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
What had happened to the Hunters, a normal middle-class family, in the 
intervening decade to change them so dramatically? 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it didn't begin with Roland. Catherine was the first one to be 
detained," Lucienne replied. In 1983, Catherine, an authoritative, gentle young 
woman, was picked up under provisions of South Africa's Internal Security Act 
-- which meant no lawyer, no family visits and indefinite detention without 
being charged. Her offense turned out to be having the wrong friends. Then a 
23-year-old education student, she was seen by security police walking with a 
white student who was about to go on trial for being an ANC supporter. Unless 
she testified against him in court, she was told, she would go to jail for five 
to six years. She held out for nine weeks, then the student confessed. Her 
testimony no longer needed, she was released. 
</P>
<P>
Five weeks later, Roland was arrested. With the family preoccupied with 
Catherine, he had not bothered to mention that he was spying for the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of having two of four children detained seemed a bit unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"Three, actually," Lucienne chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary, the Hunter's third child, was detained in 1988 under South Africa's 
emergency regulations, imposed on the uprising's 10th anniversary. Rosemary was 
then student council president at the University of Witwatersrand, and had ties 
with active black student unions. She was never interrogated, and, after a 
week, she was released -- still uncertain why she was detained. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, one way or another, it's been an interesting 10 years," Lucienne said. On 
a single night in 1984, Roland's car was vandalized, seven bricks were thrown 
into Rosemary's apartment, and the neighbor's murdered cat, still warm, left on 
her doorstep. The phone rang with a death threat. Another time, Catherine's 
apartment was the target of three petrol bombs thrown through the windows. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the family car was doused with gasoline and then set on fire. Lucienne 
ran out with a fire extinguisher -- which she didn't know how to operate. 
"There it was burning, looking like brandy over a Christmas pudding, and I 
couldn't do anything about it." By the light of the fire, she read the 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
When I kept pressing the Hunters about what had motivated such defiance, the 
implicit answer was one word: apartheid. Like the black children who took to 
the streets in 1976, it was simply a matter of anger and conscience coming 
together with experience at the right moment to express it. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunters have no bitterness, nor do they think of themselves as particularly 
noble or special. "So many have suffered so much more and so much longer than I 
have," Roland said. "I am white, and that counted even in prison." Although he 
had spied for the ANC, Hunter was confined to a whites-only jail. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had it to live over, we wouldn't change any of it," added Lucienne. "We 
have all grown enormously. Maybe we played a small part in what's happened. 
And, of course, we intend to see it through." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the de facto changes over the past decade and the dramatic pledges this 
year of reform to end the apartheid era, "seeing it through" is not going to be 
easy. Changing laws is only one step; integration and equality for the nation's 
four races in day-to-day life are the bigger tests for coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
Some South Africans, such as Roland Hunter, are trying to lay the groundwork. 
Although he finished a graduate economics degree by correspondence while in 
prison, Roland decided not to be a lecturer after all. After his release, he 
plunged into a program called the "One City Campaign" designed to eventually 
bring black townships and white cities, like Soweto and Johannesburg, together. 
But it is a process that, by almost everyone's admission, will take years, even 
decades to complete. Black scars and white fears are deep and lingering, and 
somehow, if it is to build a lasting nonracial society, South Africa must find 
a way to heal both.

PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MILLIONAIRE; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN HE SOLD A $1.75-MILLION SCREENPLAY, SHANE BLACK BECAME A HOLLYWOOD ROLE 
MODEL, WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GREENBERG, James Greenberg is a Los Angeles-based writer who is not 
currently working on a screenplay. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT'S AN ORDINARY NIGHT AT THE Pad O' Guys, the West Los Angeles bungalow where 
screenwriter Shane Black and a dozen or so buddies from his UCLA days hang out 
discussing the weighty topics of the day, such as how long it's been since any 
of them had sex. A picket sign from the Writers Guild strike two years ago 
decorates the wall and a promotional display from the movie "Flipper" and an 
assortment of toys and movie hype collect dust on the mantle. No Good 
Housekeeping seal of approval here. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings. "It's a girl," someone yells in excitement and disbelief. A 
basketball game is on TV but it's just background noise; this is not a 
household of jocks. Neighbors think they're vampires. Amid the commotion, Black 
sits in the corner of the cluttered living room, with a Dominos pepperoni pizza 
on his lap. For dessert, he wolfs down a couple of Haagen-Dazs ice cream bars. 
</P>
<P>
Considering their frat-house lifestyle, it's hard to believe that these people 
are successful screenwriters, actors, production designers and animators. It is 
almost a badge of honor to downplay accomplishments, and anyone displaying the 
least bit of pretension is instantly deflated. Black half seriously thinks of 
himself and his friends as "10 guys in a sinking boat." But to many 
screenwriters of his generation, Black is a role model of how to flourish in an 
industry famous for using and abusing writers. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Black has lived out every screenwriter's dream. In 1986, he 
sold his tough-guy buddy script, "Lethal Weapon," to Warner Bros for $250,000. 
Then last April he upped the ante for spec scripts when he auctioned another 
macho adventure tale, "The Last Boy Scout," to the David Geffen Co. for a 
staggering $1.75 million. He is one of an increasing number of writers reaping 
the benefits of Hollywood's new hunger for completed scripts submitted on 
speculation -- written without a contract from a studio or producer. In a town 
that historically has undervalued screenplays, Black's script was a milestone 
-- for a few months he was the country's highest paid screenwriter. But the 
spending spree quickly escalated and soon his record was surpassed by Joe 
Eszterhas' script for "Basic Instinct," which Carolco Pictures bought for $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that writers deserve at least as big a share as any aspect of the 
creative team," Black says. "The writer is as important as, well, the 
director." With big payoffs for scripts such as "The Last Boy Scout" and 
others, writers are finally asserting the power of the screenplay in the 
movie-making equation, attempting to secure creative control along with the big 
money. 
</P>
<P>
But Black is neither a crusader for writers' rights nor a 
celebrity-in-training. His no-style style -- T-shirt, ripped jeans and 4-day 
stubble -- is a comment on what he considers important. "I don't need the 
beautiful girl on my arm and the fancy car and the best restaurant," he says 
over coffee at Norm's in West Los Angeles, his favorite restaurant. "You could 
make a lifetime out of just trying to maintain your status as a cool guy. What 
I care about is the work." 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't changed much for Black since the big deal. A few nights after 
becoming Hollywood's latest millionaire, he was in a bar with his older brother 
Terry, his longtime mentor and a successful screenwriter himself ("Dead Heat"). 
"After ordering a beer, Shane pulled out his wallet and turns to me and says, 
'Terry, I'm a little low on cash. Could you loan me $10?' I looked at him and 
said, 'Shane, get a job. This writing isn't going to pan out.' He cracked up. 
Shane just doesn't understand what it means to be wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
He still drives a beat-up Mustang convertible and lives in a rented house on 
the Westside with four roommates. "I don't have any immediate plans for the 
money," Black says. "I know this sounds dumb, but every two weeks or so I go on 
a big spree at the Mysterious bookstore on Beverly, and if I see a series of 
books that's going to run me $50, I'm not going to say that's too much. But 
that's really the only difference. And on people's birthdays I buy slightly 
nicer gifts." 
</P>
<P>
If Black isn't particularly interested in his money, a lot of other people are. 
On the same day that accounts of his windfall appeared on the front pages of 
The Times and Variety, he received a call from a Westside real estate agent who 
wanted to help him find a new house. So many people want a piece of Black that 
he has started to become protective of his time and privacy; the message on his 
answering machine apologizes if he's been neglecting you. 
</P>
<P>
One call that he wishes he didn't take came in the middle of the night from a 
female acquaintance, who berated him for his success. "She woke me up at 2 a.m. 
saying she just wanted to let me know that she thought I was sick for writing 
this stuff and making so much money," he remembers. "I should be ashamed of 
myself because there are real writers out there struggling and I write this 
trash." 
</P>
<P>
Like any other successful writer, he's received his share of criticism. Women 
frequently attack his work for being too violent and totally male oriented. "I 
don't hate women," Black says. "If a feminist thinks I'm evil because I dip 
heavily into male icons, then I will have trouble getting along with that 
person. I write about male heroes because I write adventure fiction. So sue 
me." 
</P>
<P>
BLACK'S SOFT, almost weary delivery seems to keep a lid over his emotions -- 
rage, frustration, and even happiness only occasionally dart out from under the 
cover. He tends to be overly critical of his social skills and says he didn't 
go on a date until he was in college. He thinks of writers as the guys who 
stand in the corner at a party gawking at the girls. Looking at his six-foot 
frame and solid build, it is hard to imagine him as the 98-pound weakling he 
claims he was in high school and in some ways still imagines himself to be. 
He's surprised that his shyness is sometimes perceived as arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
For fun, Black is content to shoot pool in his garage, read a good mystery and 
hang out with his friends. The center of his social life is the Pad O' Guys. 
Conversation at the Pad, a cross between an L.A. Algonquin round-table and a 
bull session by a couple white guys hanging around a mini-mall, ranges from 
banter about great-looking babes to semi-serious discussions of favorite 
movies. "We're not totally geeks, but we used to be," he says by way of 
explaining the bond that keeps a core group of 10 or 15 guys and a couple of 
girls together seven years after finishing college. 
</P>
<P>
Any visit to the PAD includes, at no extra cost, a tour of the premises, 
including a stop at the "Shane Shrine," a framed copy of a story from People 
magazine hanging in the place of honor in the dining room. It is unlikely, 
however, that much actual dining goes on there. In the kitchen, a 7-Up coffee 
shop placard features the PAD O' GUYS MENU, offering such items as praise, a 
rare commodity, for 50 cents, or sarcasm, clearly in greater supply, for only a 
cent. To describe their housekeeping skills, the Guys tell a story about how 
after their annual PAD O' PARTY last August they started to smell what they 
thought was a dead rat under the floor. It wasn't until two months later that 
someone opened the oven and discovered the remains of a piece of raw chicken 
left over from the party. 
</P>
<P>
When they first met at college, most of the Guys were just beginning to figure 
out what they wanted to do when they grew up. In those days, Black was a 
theater major. An actor and a stand-up comic, he was known as the Wild Man for 
throwing things around the stage and his general erratic behavior. He wrote a 
string of one-act plays and continued on stage throughout college but scrapped 
acting after he graduated because he was too intimidated by auditions. "It was 
very frightening to think I could just go on not having a career and end up 
living at home," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Home was in Pittsburgh until high school when his father moved his printing 
business to to Fullerton. His father, an ex-college football player, passed his 
affection for hard-boiled heroes on to his son. Shane devoured the Mickey 
Spillane books and the Matt Helm adventures his father left lying around the 
house and then sneaked down to Sun Drugs to spend his lunch money on more pulp 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
He started writing at an early age -- comic strips, short stories, journalism 
-- but never thought of it as a way to make a living until his last year in 
college. His friend Fred Dekker, who was working on a screenplay assignment, 
showed him his sci-fi script and suggested that he try it too. "It just popped 
like a bubble in my head that writing was not impossible and that, in fact, I 
would probably be good at it." 
</P>
<P>
After college, Black worked as a typist for a temp agency, a data entry clerk 
for the 1984 Olympics and, for a short time, an usher in a Westwood movie 
theater. Finally, he made the big move and asked his parents to support him for 
six months while he wrote a screenplay. The result was "The Shadow Company," a 
supernatural thriller set in Vietnam that he describes as a cross between 
"Platoon" and "The Exorcist." With Dekker's help, the script landed him an 
agent and a lot of posh lunch meetings with mid-level studio executives. Black 
enjoyed the attention for a couple of months until he realized that he was 
wasting his time. Instead of buying "The Shadow Company," they wanted to give 
him an assignment. Even then Black knew that that was not for him. "I was 
terrified of being hired. I didn't want to have to work on a deadline. So I 
stopped taking meetings and sat down and wrote a script in about six weeks. And 
that was 'Lethal Weapon.' " 
</P>
<P>
Before starting work on a rewrite on "Lethal Weapon," Black asked the film's 
producer, Joel Silver, if he could have a minor acting role the movie Silver 
was then shooting. He was cast as a soldier in "Predator," an action picture 
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger that was filmed in Puerto Vallarta. For Black, 
it was like a paid vacation, "reading a lot of books, hanging out in the 
jungle, dancing at Mexican discos." Around the same time, he sold another 
screenplay, "The Monster Squad," which he co-wrote with Dekker, who then 
directed it. 
</P>
<P>
"Lethal Weapon" opened in 1986 and there he was, a 24-year-old kid with 
$250,000 in the bank and a hit movie on his hands. Was he happy? Not really. It 
was all a little too much too soon and when Black stopped moving, he lost his 
balance. "By keeping busy from the time I started writing 'Lethal Weapon' until 
basically the movie had come out, I hadn't really faced the fact that I had 
been making all this money and surviving all this pressure," he says. "And 
finally I reached a point where it caught up to me. I guess I didn't really 
deal with success very well for a while. I didn't feel I deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the money and the expectations became a burden. In his car one day, 
Black turned to his friend Jim Birge and suggested that they drive to Las Vegas 
and bet all his profits on red. Whether he was serious or not, Birge talked him 
out of it, but realized that Black was near the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Black wrote the first draft for "Lethal Weapon 2" with novelist Warren Miller 
in which, perhaps reflecting his dark mood, Black killed off Mel Gibson's 
character. Close friends, who had always seen that half-crazed heroic character 
as Black's alter ego, feared that this was a symbolic suicide. Whatever Black's 
motivation, Warner Bros, who was financing the film, had no intention of 
pulling the plug on a money-making series. And when it became clear that it 
wanted a more comedic approach to the material, Black dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
It was a relief; things were beginning to crash in and Black lost his desire to 
write. A family illness threatened to destroy the one constant source of 
stability in his life. Then a longterm relationship fell apart, leaving Shane's 
already shaky confidence at a low point. This is a period the usually 
accommodating Black is reluctant to talk about in detail. For the next two 
years he would do no writing, spending much of his time hanging out at the Pad. 
"I was afraid to do the next project, afraid of failing, afraid of being a 
fluke." 
</P>
<P>
He finally managed to pull himself together, forget about the money and the 
expectations and sit down long enough to tell a story, this time a gritty 
detective tale about gambling and corruption in professional football. When he 
took "The Last Boy Scout" five months later to a local copy shop, he was still 
wondering if he had wasted his time. 
</P>
<P>
BLACK AND A HOST of other writers, some selling their first screenplays, 
discovered that Hollywood, 1989, was the quintessential right place at the 
right time. For the past two decades, the protocol of the screenplay sale 
dictated that a writer go to a studio to pitch an idea; some describe it as 
groveling. If it were well received, he or she would then be paid to execute 
several closely supervised rewrites until the film got made or, more likely, 
the studio grew tired of it. Countless screenplays and years of work regularly 
disappeared down the black hole known as development. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past couple of years, things started to change. Start-up operations 
at the Sony-owned Columbia Pictures and the JVC-financed Largo Entertainment, 
along with acquisition-eager independents such as Morgan Creek, Carolco and 
Island Pictures, created a demand for big budget action scripts, potential 
blockbusters. The easiest way for a new company to get going is to acquire a 
few high-priced, high-profile scripts. Agents, never shy, have taken advantage 
of the demand and whipped it into a frenzy, orchestrating heated bidding wars, 
like military campaigns. Strict time limits, often 24 hours, give the 
proceedings an added air of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
Black's agent, Bill Block, head of the InterTalent Agency, called a handful of 
studio heads and powerful producers and told them that they could pick up a 
copy of Shane Black's new script at his reception desk. It would be sold before 
the end of the day, he assured each one, and it would be sold for more than $1 
million. By the end of the day, it had sold for nearly double that price. 
</P>
<P>
Black scowls at the thought that he encouraged the spec revolution in 
Hollywood. "My attitude is I did this, it's my sale. I may never do it again. 
I'm not concerned that all these writers seem to say I made this big 
difference. Well, I refuse to take responsibility for either brightening or 
dimming the prospects of other writers. I get what I get." 
</P>
<P>
But in the next breath Black will defend a writer's contribution to a movie and 
his right to be paid well for his work. "My feeling is if a movie earns $150 
million for the studio, it is certainly worth paying $2 million to the writer. 
I think the writer's cut is worth 2% of the film's gross box office at least." 
</P>
<P>
No one agrees more than agents who represent the writers. Marty Bauer, partner 
in the Bauer-Benedict Agency, argues that with budgets for films doubling and 
tripling, scripts are simply catching up to the escalating salaries paid to the 
other talent. "Studio executives are screaming. They're motivated by profit. 
But when writers do the same thing, they're appalled." 
</P>
<P>
With Joe Eszterhas' $3 million sale as a benchmark, there is no doubt that the 
spec market is driving up the price of screenplays. But most executives argue 
that chasing spec scripts -- bidding in the morning and buying in the afternoon 
-- is not the ideal way to do business; for one thing, it barely leaves time to 
read the actual script. "It forces you to take an abstract leap of faith based 
on hype," says producer Brian Grazier, whose Imagine Entertainment has been 
active on the spec market during the past year. "It's like being pushed off a 
cliff." 
</P>
<P>
"It's too expensive a game to play," says David Hoberman, president of Disney's 
Touchstone Pictures division. "We tend to shy away from the auction situation." 
</P>
<P>
Disney's formula has been to develop ideas internally and have writers under 
contract execute them. Other studios are now beginning to do the same thing. 
This year, in a return to the traditions of the old studio system of 
filmmaking, Fox Chairman Joe Roth began hiring staff writers with longterm 
contracts. "We will try to get involved with talented and prolific writers who 
in the course of a couple of years can deliver a number of screenplays. That 
way we won't be in such a pressured environment and can actually read material 
and make thoughtful, measured decisions," Roth says. "I have nothing against 
writers getting a lot of money. It's the methodology of buying on spec that's 
bothersome." 
</P>
<P>
A writer signed by Fox, Dale Launer ("Ruthless People"), made his deal about 
nine months ago, before the boom market for spec scripts. He admits that he has 
some regrets and might not have made the same deal today. "It's interesting how 
writers react to Shane's deal. A lot of them react with jealousy and envy 
because they're not getting that kind of money and they feel they're as good. 
Whatever script sold for $1,750,000 will be up for very close inspection and 
there's no way any script can live up to that," Launer says. 
</P>
<P>
As with all things in the film business, the success of "The Last Boy Scout" 
and other spec projects at the box office will determine the fate of spec 
scripts. Whatever the outcome, Launer considers these high-powered deals 
enormously positive steps for writers. "Writers will get more respect because 
this is a town that respects money. Now maybe more movies will be made the way 
they should be, with writers having more control," Launer says. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe now "young writers will be encouraged to go with whatever they have a 
passion for instead of any old idea the studio has, like a car that turns into 
a guy, or whatever," Black says. But ultimately spec writing for him is more a 
matter of personal temperament than Hollywood activism. "It's a gamble. But 
it's a gamble I'm willing to take because if I wrote a script on assignment and 
no one makes the movie, then I'd rather I had never written it. I don't want to 
write a script that no one likes or no one makes." 
</P>
<P>
THERE IS ALMOST no way "The Last Boy Scout" won't be made. After the Geffen Co. 
payed almost $3 million for just the screenplay and the producer, Warner Bros, 
the film's distributor may as well start putting trailers in the theaters now. 
Bruce Willis has been signed to star in the film and Warner Bros President Mark 
Canton is shooting for a January, 1991, start and a Christmas release. For 
Black, the pressure to succeed is intense. "I figure if they're going to pay me 
this much money, then I'd better be the best, I'd better make this great," he 
says with a swagger of confidence and a flash of fear all at once. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the script was sold, Black was in a rewrite meeting getting 
advice from 14 people on how to improve the script he'd obsessed about for five 
months. Currently, he's locked up in his cabin at Bear Mountain hammering out 
yet another draft, trying to maintain the spirit of the original and satisfy 
the not-always-compatible requirements of the studio and the star. He grumbles 
a lot but he's been around long enough to realize that after the first draft, 
you're writing for the studio and that means making changes right and left. 
Black's cooperative but he's no pushover. How does he handle himself in 
meetings? "Quite like he does on the page, but without the guns," Canton says. 
</P>
<P>
Like everything Black has written, "The Last Boy Scout" is basically a modern 
western, but in his morally ambiguous world the characters become more than 
good guys and bad guys. "I really love Chandler and Ross McDonald," Black says. 
"They wrote about personal integrity, morality, conflict, dealing with 
insanity, dealing with pain and death. All those things are extremely important 
to me beyond just writing a thrilling movie." 
</P>
<P>
For "The Last Boy Scout," Black thought that the seamy side of professional 
football would make an ideal milieu for a Chandleresque private eye story. 
"Football is the perfect medium because it combines the spirit of the American 
hero with the spirit of American greed." When a burnt out, hard-as-nails 
detective reluctantly joins forces with a washed up ex-quarterback to expose a 
sports gambling ring that extends to the U.S. Senate, action-packed mayhem 
ensues. 
</P>
<P>
Black gets really annoyed when his movies are labeled action pictures. 
"Commando," where a man just fires a gun for the final thirty minutes, that's 
an action picture, he says. What the character is thinking about as he is 
firing is of more interest to Black. Character, he argues, must be the impetus 
for all action. 
</P>
<P>
According to Black, the film industry has only two categories for movies: 
"serious films and money-makers. It's either about apartheid or starving 
people, or it's Ninja turtles." But to Black, who sees life in terms of heroic 
gestures in a world that can disintegrate at a moment's notice, horror movies 
such as "The Exorcist" or thrillers such as "48 HRS." are more reflective of 
reality than the serious stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But he chokes on the pretentiousness of calling himself a serious writer."I 
would rather be thought of as a storyteller than an author, " he says. "Authors 
write about Russian winters. Storytellers write about guys who have adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, I'll do my revelatory sort of work. Stuff about love, once I've 
found out what it means, stuff about the nature of things. Until then, I'm 
proud to be writing mysteries," he says, fuming. 
</P>
<P>
Black says his script is not a calculated money-maker. "I thought it was too 
rough for most people. It's not a commercial formula; it's a very raunchy, down 
and dirty detective film. I didn't even think it would sell because it was 
weird and out there in terms of sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Weird and out there is where Black likes to live, at least on the page. "He's a 
Mack truck going down a hill with no brakes," says "Lethal Weapon" director 
Richard Donner. Black admits that he's hopelessly attracted to dark subject 
matter. On a visit to the Louvre last summer, a friend says, he spent hours 
gazing at a painting depicting the black plague. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he takes it too far. "A lot of people think he's depressing," says 
friend Jim Birge. "At times he's defeated and has problems with girls. 
Sometimes he's not fun to be around. He's always thinking so much." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Black pours a lot of himself into his characters. "A lot of my heroes 
are very anachronistic in that they're grouchy, gruff, very misanthropic men. 
And maybe that's because I've always felt like something of a misfit myself, if 
you wanted to get psychological. And in the end, all the men who are such 
misfits in my stories always end up validating themselves and being a hero. 
Well, I think that's rather obvious what's going on there." 
</P>
<P>
Friends say Black's mood has lightened considerably in the past year, since 
he's gotten back to work, as if writing was a way of keeping the demons on the 
page and out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, is fortunate enough to find work that is both theraputic 
and enormously lucrative, a fact that doesn't escape Black's notice. 
</P>
<P>
"If you act strange and stand outside of 7-Eleven in a baggy coat, people think 
you're psychotic," Black says. "If you act strange and take those weird 
thoughts and sell them for $1 million, people think you're eccentric. There are 
probably people who think just like me and weren't quite as lucky, and they're 
probably in an institution somewhere. So I'm lucky enough to have a marketable 
obsession, a marketable lunacy as it were."

There are 3 million stories in the naked city, and most of them are 
screenplays. Since the explosion of the spec script market during the past 
year, everyone, it seems, has an idea for the next high-concept blockbuster. 
Working without a studio contract, veterans and newcomers alike are free to 
tell their story their way. Some of them are even lucky enough to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale of Joe Eszterhas' "Basic Instinct" for $3 million, the Hollywood 
buzz virtually broke the sound barrier. Eszterhas, 46, a former reporter for 
"Rolling Stone," had written 14 original screenplays, five of them on spec. He 
sold them all, but never for anything approaching this record payoff. 
</P>
<P>
"Basic Instinct," like Eszterhas' "Jagged Edge," is the kind of sexy thriller 
with two starring roles (Michael Douglas has been cast and rumor has it 
Michelle Pfeiffer will sign) that makes producers see dollar signs. The result 
was an intense bidding war between two ex-partners, neither of whom were at all 
put off by the mediocre box office returns for Eszterhas' previous two scripts 
-- "Betrayed" and "Music Box." 
</P>
<P>
Relative unknowns also have taken advantage of the industry's spec script 
fever. Peter Filardi, 28, sold his screenplay for "Flatliners" early last year 
for $400,000. Not as high as some, but considering that he previously had sold 
only a script for an episode of the television series "MacGyver," it was not a 
bad deal. 
</P>
<P>
Filardi moved to Los Angeles in 1986, after studying English literature and 
film at Boston University, to peddle two scripts he had written for 
television's "Miami Vice." While waiting for his big break, he wrote, produced 
and directed commercials for Security Shutters, a product hawked on late-night 
TV. Without a track record, Filardi thought he had no choice but to write on 
spec. Now he wants to keep it that way. "Flatliners," a dramatic thriller about 
a group of medical students who experiment with near-death experiences, is the 
first of the current barrage of spec scripts to reach the screen, and its box 
office performance will be closely watched by industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Helgeland and Manny Coto already knew how the spec game worked when they 
hit paydirt this year. Helgeland had written the screenplay for "976-Evil" and 
the fourth installment of "Nightmare on Elm Street." Coto is a graduate of the 
American Film Institute and had directed two independent features. They were 
both 29 and tired of working in obscurity. Talking on the phone one night, they 
decided not to hang up until they had come up with an idea for a million dollar 
screenplay. What if a nuclear weapon became sentient? asked Coto. They were 
sure they had a can't-miss concept; and so was their agent. 
</P>
<P>
A week before the script was ready to circulate, the agency sent out ticking 
clocks to industry executives. "The Ticking Man" generated a bidding war and 
was sold for $1 million. (Bruce Willis has been cast, and a spring start is 
anticipated.) "With a spec script you can leap-frog up," Helgeland says. 
"People know who you are and that's what the game is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Not all spec scripts move as fast as "The Ticking Man." Laurence Dworet, 40, 
and Robert Roy Poole, 36, wrote "Ultimatum" in 1980 when, in the shadow of the 
Iran hostage crisis, the climate was not right for the tale of a presidential 
adviser battling terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Poole and Dworet had met at UCLA film school and wrote two more scripts 
together on assignment but neither was produced. In the meantime, Dworet kept 
his job as an emergency room doctor, and Poole adapted a few novels for the 
screen. "Ultimatum" was resurrected last year when Poole met a producer at a 
poker game who asked if he had any scripts in the closet. Playing off the 
interest stirred by "The Hunt for Red October," their agent sent the script out 
and sold it for $500,000. Steven Spielberg reportedly is interested in 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gorman, 29, and Michael Beckner, 26, knew they'd have a hard time pitching 
"Texas Lead and Gold" but they wanted to write a western so badly that they 
went ahead and did it anyway. Beckner, a fiction writing student at USC, did 
most of the writing while Gorman, a graduate of USC's Peter Stark producing 
program, became the film's producer. "Texas Lead and Gold," an adventure story 
reminiscent of "Treasure of the Sierra Madre," went for $1 million to the first 
bidder. "I don't enjoy the spec ride," Beckner says. "I'd rather be writing 
than waiting for the phone to ring. We were flattered we got as much as we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
David Mickey Evans may have gotten more than he bargained for when he used his 
"Radio Flyer" screenplay to leverage an assignment from Columbia Pictures to 
direct the film. He was to be paid $600,000 for the script and $500,000 for 
directing, but no one was surprised when the 27-year-old virtual unknown was 
fired two weeks into the shoot. (Richard Donner has been asked to take over the 
directorial reins.) 
</P>
<P>
"Radio Flyer," the story of two young brothers who escape into a fantasy world, 
was the first original script Evans had taken to the majors, but he has written 
21 screenplays, supporting himself through college and graduate school at 
Loyola Marymount University by writing low-budget horror pictures for the

THE HENSON SHOWS HIS HAND; 
</P>
<P>
JIM HENSON IS GONE BUT SOME OF HIS PUPPETS LIVE ON WITH 'MOTHER GOOSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Before Muppet master Jim Henson died on May 16, he saw footage of "Jim Henson's 
Mother Goose Stories," which premieres Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on the Disney 
Channel. The 13-part series, produced by Henson's production company, marks the 
directorial debut of Henson's 26-year-old son, Brian. 
</P>
<P>
"He got to see most of them," Henson said softly. "He loved them. They're real 
sweet. I think they are wonderful for the preschool audience for whom they are 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in a household populated by Kermit and the other Muppets, Henson 
said, "I thought puppetry was a much bigger thing that everybody knew about." 
His father's forte was glove puppets but Brian Henson was drawn to marionettes. 
"I loved the work of Bill Baird's Marionettes," he said. "We used to go to see 
his shows in New York City." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Henson was only peripherally involved with "Jim Henson's Mother Goose 
Stories," even though it bares his name (the series features Jim Henson 
Productions' puppets). 
</P>
<P>
The series is based on "Mother Goose in Prose," written by "The Wizard of Oz" 
creator L. Frank Baum. It's a fanciful look at the stories behind the beloved 
rhymes, with Mother Goose introducing the tales to her three goslings. The 
puppets, which interact with human performers, are designed after Maxfield 
Parrish's illustrations in the Baum book. 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour episodes consist of three stories featuring such characters as 
Peter Pumpkin Eater, Queen of Hearts, Miss Muffet, Humpty Dumpty and Bo Peep. 
Miss Muffet, for example, is a city girl who wants to go to the country, so she 
runs away. "While out in the country," Henson said, "she meets a farmer and he 
gives her curds and whey. She ends up on the tuffet and then the spider comes 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Each story was produced in one day. "We were shooting quite quickly," Henson 
said. "We were trying to get through three sets for every show. The show is a 
mixture of illustrations and real sets." 
</P>
<P>
Henson first began working with his father on the film "The Great Muppet 
Caper." His marionette expertise is on view in the scene where Kermit and Miss 
Piggy bike around a London park. 
</P>
<P>
"That was quite a complicated marionette effect," he said. "It was a marionette 
from a crane. We had a rig hanging from a crane and the crane was rolling along 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Henson did the marionette work in "The Muppets Take 
Manhattan" in the scene where rats cook food in a diner. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I started being the puppeteer who worked out complicated effects, which 
brought me to more complicated characters," Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
He performed the puppetry for the role of Jack Pumpkinhead in "The Return to 
Oz" and for the reindeer Donner in "Santa Claus: The Movie." 
</P>
<P>
Henson was one of 30 people who animated the plant Audrey II in "The Little 
Shop of Horrors." Four four months, he and his fellow puppeteers rehearsed 
every scene in the musical. 
</P>
<P>
"We would work on a scene for three weeks," he said. "When you have all of 
those people and a really dexterous puppet like Audrey, it's great fun. The 
character can do so much." 
</P>
<P>
In charge of the performance department at the Henson Creature Shop in London, 
Henson has worked with designers to create puppets that require fewer 
puppeteers. "Now we use a lot of computers with a control device so a puppeteer 
can control a lot more," he said. The dog in Jim Henson's short-lived NBC 
series "The Storyteller" was the prototype. "The dog is a hand puppet, but on 
my left hand is a complicated hand control," said Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Before "Mother Goose," Henson had done second-unit directing on several 
projects including "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." "It takes a lot of 
preproduction (directing) puppets," he said. "You have to work out the blocking 
and where the characters are going to be. The idea is to imagine the best 
action you would want, how you would want it to play, and then you design the 
sets." 
</P>
<P>
Henson has put his puppet and directing duties on the back burner since his 
father's death. "I have been very involved in the company a long time," he said 
somberly. "I am taking on an executive position; my job has changed. But it's 
too difficult to define it right now."

THE LEADERS OF THE BANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joe Saltzman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When popular bandleaders became the new American heroes, Hollywood jumped on 
the bandwagon. True to American motion-picture tradition, these musical heroes 
were white, mostly pleasant young men looking for a special sound and finding 
it with an amiable, supportive woman. 
</P>
<P>
None was more popular than The Glenn Miller Story (1954, 116 minutes) now 
available on MCA videotape and laser video disc with a newly restored 
stereophonic-surround sound track and a sharp, color-perfect picture 
(especially impressive on disc). 
</P>
<P>
The film was popular because Miller was one of the best known bandleaders of 
the Swing Era, and the audience came in humming his familiar songs: "Moonlight 
Serenade," "String of Pearls," "Pennsylvania 6-5000," "Tuxedo Junction," "In 
the Mood," "Chattanooga Choo Choo" and "Little Brown Jug." Also, Jimmy Stewart 
played Miller and June Allyson was his perky wife. The fun is in seeing how the 
songs fit into the romanticized biography roughly based on his life. 
</P>
<P>
In The Fabulous Dorseys (1947, 88 minutes, Republic tape and disc), Tommy and 
Jimmy played themselves-two bickering brothers-with Janet Blair as the girl 
caught between them. A contrived jam session featuring Ziggy Elman, Ray Bauduc, 
Charlie Barnet and Art Tatum is the film's highlight along with such familiar 
hits as "Marie" and "Green Eyes." 
</P>
<P>
After the Dorseys, Hollywood decided that actors would take over the parts. The 
Benny Goodman Story (1955, 116 minutes, MCA tape and disc) starred Steve Allen 
as Goodman and Donna Reed as his best girl. Goodman himself dubbed Allen's 
playing, and the supporting cast of musicians (including Harry James and Lionel 
Hampton and Teddy Wilson) were admirable. 
</P>
<P>
Another sentimental biography to be released on home video is The Five Pennies 
(1959, 117 minutes) with Danny Kaye as trumpeter Red Nichols and Barbara Bel 
Geddes as his patient wife. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Armstrong and a batch of fine jazz musicians play cameo roles, and when 
they are on the screen the music is first-rate. Sal Mineo gives a dynamic 
performance in The Gene Krupa Story (1959, 101 minutes, "CA/Columbia tape) that 
at least didn't ignore his drug addiction. The most dramatic and best-acted 
music biography was only "inspired" by the life of Bix Beiderbecke and featured 
Kirk Douglas (with Harry James playing) as the Young Man With a Horn (1950, 112 
minutes, Warner tape and disc). Doris Day was the wholesome girl and Lauren 
Bacall acted the bad girl in this work of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until later that the lives of black jazz artists came to the screen, 
but these films also were blatantly dishonest in their music and biographical 
facts. Most failed to capture the struggle of blacks trying to overcome white 
control of the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
Lady Sings the Blues (1972, 144 minutes, Paramount tape and disc) with Diana 
Ross as Billie Holiday was pure soap opera with one cliche after another. Even 
Richard Pryor's Piano Man didn't help much. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best musical biography yet produced came out in 1988 and told the 
story of Charlie "Bird" Parker, the brilliant jazz saxophonist who, like so 
many other African-American musicians, steadily disintegrated under the 
pressure of a white-dominated society and drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Bird (161 minutes, Warner tape and disc) has a bravura performance by Forest 
Whitaker and one of the best sound tracks ever put together-it features 
Parker's own solos recorded three and four decades ago cleverly mixed into 
newly recorded settings. 
</P>
<P>
Director Clint Eastwood captures the man and his music better than any other 
jazz film biography, and does a commendable job in showing the pervasive racism 
that forced a superb musician such as Parker to hire a white trumpeter to front 
the otherwise all-black group. Even so, most of the cliches of the musical film 
biography remain intact even up to the faithful woman, Chan, played by Diane 
Venora, the mother of Parker's two children and the key dramatic figure in the 
film. 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, COLOR, Hollywood's earliest fascination with popular musicians centered 
on white bandleaders, most notably "The Glenn Miller Story" starring Jimmy 
Stewart. But perhaps the finest-made film biography of a music man was Clint 
Eastwood's 1988 "Bird," above, starring Forrest Whitaker as jazz saxophonist 
Charlie Parker.

HOT PROPERTY: FROM SHARED BATH TO PALISADES MANSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Union-born comic YAKOV SMIRNOFF, who just got back to Los Angeles after 
performing in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, has purchased a home in Pacific 
Palisades for $2.4 million and listed his house near the Sunset Strip at 
$1,795,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving because of the neighborhood," he said with a chuckle. "We want a 
better place for Linda to push the baby cart." 
</P>
<P>
The comedian and his wife, Linda, are expecting their first child in the fall, 
about the same time that a cable TV special in which he stars will be aired on 
Showtime Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"She is my first wife, and this was my first house," he said by the swimming 
pool and aviary of the home that he put on the market. "It's been nice living 
here, but it's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Their new residence is in a more family-oriented neighborhood, on the 18th hole 
of the Riviera Country Club, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among his new neighbors are actress Goldie Hawn and actor Tom Hanks, with whom 
Smirnoff appeared in the movie "The Money Pit." Smirnoff was also in "Moscow on 
the Hudson," with Robin Williams; "Brewster's Millions," with Richard Pryor, 
and "Heartburn," with Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnoff bought a ranch-style house with three bedrooms and maid's quarters in 
3,500 square feet. "The people who owned it are moving to Connecticut," said 
Joey Coons of Prudential Rodeo Realty, who represented the comedian. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to do some things to our new home, which was built in the 
mid-'50s," Smirnoff said, "but it's clean and sturdy, something like a Mr. and 
Mrs. Cleaver house. And it's one story, which will be better for our child." 
</P>
<P>
His Sunset Strip-area house, built in the '20s but rehabbed since he bought it 
six years ago, has three stories and about 5,000 square feet, with three 
bedrooms, maid's quarters, a downstairs office and 4 1/2 baths. 
</P>
<P>
"When I lived in Russia, we shared one bath with five other families, and here 
I've had almost five baths. It's mind-boggling," he said. "You want to say, 
'What a country.' " 
</P>
<P>
He and his parents lived for 26 years in one room of a communal apartment 
building until they immigrated to the United States in 1977. He became a U.S. 
citizen in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
His enthusiasm for this country is reflected in the doorbell of his Sunset 
Strip-area house, which plays "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
The home is listed with Cheryl Crane and Jana Jones at Alvarez, Hyland &amp; 
Young, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
PETER MAX, one of America's most famous contemporary artists, has bought a home 
in Bel-Air for $2,725,000. 
</P>
<P>
Max lives primarily in a Manhattan penthouse, but he also has a house in The 
Hamptons and a country home in Connecticut. He plans to live in his Bel-Air 
home when he visits Los Angeles a few times a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean-style home has five bedrooms and five baths in about 5,000 
square feet. It also has a courtyard entry and a large, rock waterfall that 
flows into a 60-foot-long swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Built in the '20s, the home was recently restored. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Rappaport and Chris Furie of Prudential Rodeo Realty handled both sides of 
the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist IRIS RAINER DART ("Beaches," "The Boys in the Mailroom," " 'Til the 
Real Thing Comes Along") and her husband, businessman Stephen Dart, have put 
their Sherman Oaks home on the market and are moving to Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
They've been remodeling a house there that they bought last spring for about 
the same price as their Sherman Oaks house, a source said. Their Sherman Oaks 
house is listed at $1,495,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in this house for 20 years -- raised my son (Greg Wolf) and did a lot 
of my writing here, so it would be real tough to leave if we weren't moving 
with our little one (5-year-old daughter) to where we have family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband's mother, Jane, lives in Pebble Beach. She's the widow of Justin 
Dart, Stephen's father and an adviser to President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it will be the same job, different location," Iris Rainer Dart said, 
"and my husband is very involved in Republican politics; that won't change. 
He's also in the international pay-TV business and flies all over the world, so 
I might as well be where I can look out and see the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Their Pebble Beach home is on the ocean and has a view from every room. "It's 
1926 vintage, so it had a lot of internal stuff that had to be done, such as 
remodeling the bathrooms," she said, describing the house as "a Mediterranean 
white stucco with a red tile roof." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, when she bought the Sherman Oaks home, she saw it described as "a 
Connecticut farmhouse on a secluded wooded knoll." "And I thought, that's for 
me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-bedroom, 4 1/2-bath house with a writer's studio or library and a pool 
is listed with Annette Mott at Jon Douglas Co.'s Upper Bel-Air office.

WATER WISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right now, halfway through the fourth year of drought, people are being forced 
to think about water and how they use it in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to save water now, just in case the rains don't return in the 
fall and we face an unprecedented fifth year of drought. But even should it 
pour, there are some very good reasons for us to learn some new ways with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 1 is cost. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it rains for weeks, even if more water is diverted to urban areas 
(which at present only get 16% of the state's water, with 4% going to landscape 
irrigation), even 
</P>
<P>
if new dams and aqueducts are built (highly unlikely) -- water will cost more 
in the near future. It's getting the water to Southern California that's 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
And water-saving plants, systems and techniques do save money. 
</P>
<P>
In a test conducted by John Olaf Nelson of the North Marin Water District in 
Northern California, comparing small, traditional, lawn-dominated gardens to 
small, water-conserving gardens, the water-wise gardens netted a savings of 54% 
on the water bill. 
</P>
<P>
They also turned up some hidden savings: a 24% savings on labor, 61% on 
fertilizer costs and 22% on herbicide use. Because these were small condominium 
gardens, the total 
</P>
<P>
saved each year averaged only about $75, but the dollar amount would be much 
greater in grander gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 2 might be the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists think that the weather will be more erratic for the foreseeable 
future, and droughts as well as wet years, more likely. They point out that the 
weather most of us grew up with, in the 1940s, '50s and '60s, was unusually 
mild and consistent, so forget the good old days, water could be scarce at any 
time and the wise will be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 3 is the government. 
</P>
<P>
Gardeners who are unprepared might find themselves forced to learn a few new 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
As some have discovered this summer, government is not sitting idly by, but is 
busy proposing or implementing ordinances that regulate how water is used in 
the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Pending state legislation (Assembly Bill 325) will mandate that communities 
come up 
</P>
<P>
with water-saving landscape ordinances. Most of the water-saving plans now in 
effect were developed by water districts, after legislation six years ago 
required them to come up with plans. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, most ordinances in California cities are quite reasonable, 
limiting when you can water or -- at the most -- how much you can water, but in 
the wings are proposals that tell you what kind of irrigation equipment you can 
use, and even what plants you can grow. 
</P>
<P>
Plant lists are the greatest threat. They would tell gardeners and nurseries 
what they can or cannot grow. Says landscape architect Lisa Iwata, one of the 
organizers of the annual Xeriscape Conference in Southern California, which 
promotes water-conserving gardens, "Plant lists are scary." 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 4 is changing aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
This may turn out to be a fad or fashion, but at the moment, the bright-green 
garden -- based on and around a large expanse of lawn -- is out. 
</P>
<P>
There is a new aesthetic in California gardens and it is a leaner, sunnier 
look. Lawns do not dominate this look and are often absent. Instead, there are 
paths and patios, ground-covering mulches, and lots of shrubs and perennials 
that are not bright green, but olive green or gray green. 
</P>
<P>
It is not entirely clear if these gardens are factually more frugal with water, 
but people do water them less, and typically with something other than 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
In the North Marin study, there was a definite water-savings of 54% in 
water-conserving gardens, but most of this was attributed to the lack of a lawn 
and the grasses grown in this part of Northern California tend to be the 
thirsty kinds -- bluegrass, rye and fescue -- not the more drought-tolerant 
warm-season grasses prevalent in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Reason No. 5 is just for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us might resist the new ways and new technologies. Gardening is, after 
all, a pleasant repast from the techno-world we live in -- just you and the 
soil, working together to make things grow -- hands in the dirt, thumb clamped 
over the hose. 
</P>
<P>
But these new ways and new technologies can be fun, so much so that they can 
become a hobby of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Now when it gets too dark to be out in the garden, you can pour over brochures, 
leaflets and catalogues -- studying and learning. Neighbors and friends will 
seek you out for your new-found wisdom and new ways. You'll know what ET 
(evapotranspiration) is, and that a "tortuous path" is not the Pacific Coast 
Highway on a good beach day. (A tortuous path is a new way of preventing drip 
systems from clogging). You'll be able to speak of "precipitation rates" and 
polymers. You may even be able to converse about computers in the garden, 
because they are coming. 
</P>
<P>
Avid gardeners can give you a few more reasons to find some new ways with 
water: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flowers that fall over from the weight of water droplets on their leaves or 
blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Diseases on roses and other plants, and even some common pests. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Plants that are too tall and need staking; young trees that blow down 
during Santa Ana winds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Plants that die soon after planting, or several years later from root rots. 
</P>
<P>
These common garden problems can be solved, or at least mitigated, if you adopt 
some of these new ways with water. 
</P>
<P>
Are gardens and gardening practices about to change dramatically? Probably not. 
Or at least not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Lawns are sure to shrink in size, and already are -- Santa Barbara nurseryman 
Ray Sodomka calls them the "new, little lawns" -- as people discover the 
pleasures of growing other things in their place. But there will always be a 
place for flowers and vegetables and other favorite plants. They will just have 
to be managed more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Even lawns can be better managed. Forest Lawn, with its extensive turf areas, 
has managed to save about 20% of its water through improved management using 
low-flow sprinkler heads and new data called ET, according to chief engineer 
Clint Granath. That's a lot of water saved -- roughly 100 acre feet, which 
would have cost about $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
So where does one begin with these new ways? With simple waste. 
</P>
<P>
In a naturally summer-dry state there should be no excuse for waste. Water that 
runs down gutters and out to the sea is simple waste, helping nothing and no 
one. Water lost to the atmosphere through evaporation raises the humidity while 
contributing nothing to the environment and is similarly wasteful. A 
considerable amount is lost this way because of the way we water with 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
Water used to hose down driveways or sidewalks may be wasted, although some now 
question if using deafening leaf blowers to redistribute dirt and pollutants 
(they simply settle somewhere else) is a wise water-saving tactic. Here, 
however, government has already acted and banned the hosing down of sidewalks 
and driveways. 
</P>
<P>
But, water that goes to plants is definitely not wasted -- it is a renewable 
resource after all -- and watering the garden is not an evil act, though some 
make it out to be. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps watering during the middle of the day when the wind blows much of the 
water toward Tucson is a matter for the "drought police," but sensible 
irrigation should not be. There is strong evidence that it actually helps the 
urban environment, by keeping plants growing even during the hot, smoggy 
season, cooling and cleansing the air. 
</P>
<P>
The trick, then, is using that water wisely, with little waste. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architect Ken Smith of Thousand Oaks, who wrote the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power's "40 Ways to Save Water in Your Yard and 
Garden," says that simply checking to see if something needs water and 
remembering to turn the water off afterwards, can save the 10% asked for by the 
city this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Over the coming weeks, we will look at many of the new, wiser ways on these 
pages.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
* If you water your lawn well and still have brown spots, lawn moths may be to 
blame. Consult a nurseryman for the proper treatment. 
</P>
<P>
* If your tuberous begonias are dropping buds, they may need more air 
circulation or more sun. 
</P>
<P>
* Give yellowing azaleas, citrus, rhododendrons or camellias an iron supplement 
along with normal fertilization programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Harvest vegetables from your garden in the morning when they are crisp and 
cool.

Twenty answers home buyers must learn to recognize: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Why, before you know it, all those messy overhead wires will disappear 
underground." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "See, the overall plan calls for this particular street to end in a nice 
quiet cul-de-sac when it's all finished." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Sure you can work out your share of the new fence with him -- he's a sweet 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The city maintains the grass and trees from the curb up to, oh, about here 
-- no problem, really." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Cable's due next month." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "All I know is there's this big property fight at the traffic light -- the 
supermarket can't wait to get close to this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It's a cinch, they are permanently rerouting the buses two blocks away." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Don't sweat it -- the owner's having all the old trash hauled away this 
weekend and come Monday, the place will sparkle, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Oh, the red curb there in front -- that's a mistake the city will fix." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The street light's not broken, just turned off so as not to shine in the 
master bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Well, you share the water meter with four others, but splitting the bill 
every month is a breeze." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Oh, it's only a rumor that the SWAT team raided the Middle School down the 
block last month." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "So, your dog runs away a lot -- on this street everybody just loves pets." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "That greenish coloring on the roof, that's just for old-style effect." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Reception's always real good, so you could move the two dish antennas off 
the patio without any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "They're awfully good out here about renegotiating your property taxes -- 
all you do is ask." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Those potholes will go -- they resurface in this district every six months 
like clockwork." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Boats, campers, RVs -- park them anywhere -- driveway, front yard, on the 
street as long as you want." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "And you know what's real nice -- the trash people come right up to your 
back door and no noise." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Those look little but they're really dwarf fruit trees and they're 
supposed to turn brown right now."

SPEAKING OUT: 4 STEPS TO ALLEVIATE SOUTHLAND'S WATER SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID D. PAGANO, Pagano is principal of d.d. Pagano, Irrigation Consultants, 
Santa Ana, an affiliate of Sasaki Associates Inc., the nation's largest land 
planning and landscape architecture firm with offices through the country. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All of California, and metropolitan Los Angeles in particular, is suffering 
from the four-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, statewide precipitation fell to 60% of the normal amount, and 
water from snow runoff was 40% normal. Some of the state's reservoirs are 
perilously low and a few are completely empty. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the City Council rejected Mayor Tom Bradley's mandatory water 
rationing program citing successful voluntary reductions in water consumption 
by city residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although normal winter rains and snowfall will eventually resume, water 
shortages are now a permanent fact of life for greater Los Angeles because of 
the widening statewide gap between supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
Dams and aqueducts that carry water from the northern part of the state to the 
arid south are increasingly difficult to build because of environmental, legal 
and financial obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, moreover, can no longer rely on the Colorado River to make 
up the shortfall in supply because of a 1964 Supreme Court decision that allows 
Arizona to increase its consumption of Colorado River water in droughts. Next 
year, Southern California's share of that supply will drop from 1.2 million 
acre feet to 900,000 acre feet. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, demand for water is rising. Greater Los Angeles' population 
is about 13 million -- a figure projected to reach 16.4 million in 2000 and 
18.3 million in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the increasing demand for water must be slowed, or even reduced, to 
preserve our quality of life and assure continued economic competitiveness and 
growth. What can homeowners and residential real estate developers do? How can 
we plan new homes and communities -- and adapt existing ones -- to the 
water-scarce future? 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: To save water, Southern Californians need not endure forced 
water rationing. Nor do they have to install gravel lawns or plant their 
gardens with cacti instead of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is a combination of four strategies: water-conserving landscaping, 
water-conserving technology, better water management through education and more 
realistic pricing of water to the residential customer. 
</P>
<P>
Xeriscaping, the increasingly popular term used to describe water-conserving 
landscaping, blends drought-tolerant plants with those that may require more 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Xeriscaping reduces large turf areas in favor of a wide variety of plants and 
shrubs that flower and provide a source of ground cover normally associated 
with areas of turf. Dozens of attractive "unthirsty" plants and shrubs are 
found in Southern California and offer year-round color. 
</P>
<P>
When sensitively planned, xeriscaping creates an aesthetically pleasing 
landscape around the house or multifamily complex. The lawn appears more 
healthy, because xeriscaping eliminates turf from hard-to-water areas such as 
slopes, sidewalk strips, and areas next to the home. Further, the introduction 
of the unthirsty plants in place of the turf creates a richer palette of colors 
within the yard that can be enjoyed year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, xeriscaping's advantages extend far beyond decreased water usage. 
Its reduced turf areas also result in decreased use of herbicides, decreased 
amounts of fertilizer, decreased fuel consumption for lawn mowing and clipping 
removal and decreased labor costs for gardening. 
</P>
<P>
Xeriscaping is an idea whose time has come. Before the current drought, several 
Southern California cities, including Los Angeles and Santa Monica, required 
that landscape plans for major developments be reviewed for water usage before 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, moreover, requires new housing developments to xeriscape the 
yard of at least one model home. 
</P>
<P>
The second strategy for reducing residential water consumption is better use of 
technology. Many Southern Californians are already familiar with low-flow 
shower heads and toilets in their homes. However, they remain largely 
uninformed of the new-generation technologies that are capable of reducing 
water usage at the communitywide level. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,800-home Northbridge community in Valencia utilizes much of this new 
technology. There, soil sensors in the ground relay data on a daily basis to an 
automatic irrigation monitor, which then adjusts watering times. Separate flow 
meters constantly check the irrigation system for damage in the lines, 
automatically shutting down parts of the system in the event of trouble. A 
laptop computer connects directly into the irrigation monitor, allowing 
Northbridge's developer to accurately monitor water usage at any time. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Spectrum, a massive 2,200-acre office/industrial project in Orange 
County, also recognizes the advantages of using technology for water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to water conservation in landscaping, the future is now, " said 
Mike Padian, director of development for the Irvine Industrial Co. "You either 
do it now or pay later; it's just foolish not to." 
</P>
<P>
As part of its water management program, the Irvine Co. has no only selected 
drought-tolerant plants for the medians and parkways, but also has 
strategically placed soil sensors to collect data. The data is related to a 
computer that automatically adjusts irrigation schedules to compensate for 
fluctuations in rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the new technologies for communitywide water conservation are this 
high-tech. Some of the surprisingly simple technologies include pop-up 
sprinklers, which reduce costs from vandalism; drip irrigation and 
low-precipitation sprinkler heads that help eliminate water runoff, and the use 
of reclaimed water to irrigate large areas such as parkways and median 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
Although xeriscaping and water-conserving technology promise to decrease water 
use, their widespread implementation in new developments could take years. 
Retrofitting existing communities could take even longer, at significant cost 
to taxpayers and property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Southern Californians greatest opportunity to reduce water 
consumption in the coming months -- without forced water rationing -- is more 
efficient and comprehensive water management through education. Many 
homeowners, for instance, overwater their lawn two or three times more than 
needed, thereby wasting precious water and often drowning the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Several communities have realized the practicality of implementing 
water-management education programs in hopes of initially reducing water 
consumption by 20% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, for instance, has xeriscaped the land in front of some municipal 
offices. Besides providing water savings to the city, the land serves as an 
exhibit garden for area residents. Individuals interested in xeriscaping are 
provided with free written materials through the water conservation program 
operated by the city's Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
Other educational programs can reduce water consumption by teaching Southern 
Californians to water at night to decrease water evaporation, to reduce 
overpressurization in the home, and to avoid overwatering lawns and plants. By 
implementing these programs in elementary schools, we can instill water 
conservation pride in the next generation of potential guzzlers. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth and final strategy is a more realistic pricing of water. In the 
past, many municipalities determined the cost of water by the cost of 
distribution rather than its replacement. The resulting price structure was 
inverted, water wasters were not penalized for their profligacy. 
</P>
<P>
With more realistic pricing structures, water charges are graduated: The more 
water the homeowners use, the more they pay for the gallons above a certain 
point. 
</P>
<P>
This won't be the first time that Southern Californians have needed to use 
water prudently. Look back to our region at the turn of the century, before 
aqueducts provided a steady supply of cheap water. In that water-scarce era, 
Southern California was a garden spot and its life style was the envy of all 
America.

APARTMENT LIFE: WHEN BABY COMES, LANDLORD CAN EVICT FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age magazine, a 
publication of The Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' 
service group.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My wife and I have been living in our two-bedroom apartment in 
Redondo Beach for over two years. When we moved in, we signed a rental 
agreement that said, among other things, "occupancy will be no more than two 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
Guess what. Next month we're expecting a child. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the catch. The original owner said he would have no problem with 
children if they came along. Unfortunately, he died. His son now runs the 
building. He's not given us any indication that a problem may be brewing, but I 
can't help wondering if he has any grounds to evict us for having the child. 
</P>
<P>
Can he evict us for having a child? If the worst comes, how much notice would 
be required? Would this be considered discrimination? I appreciate any 
information you can provide. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The owner of your building could probably evict you for having an extra 
person in your apartment in violation of your rental agreement. It doesn't 
necessarily matter that the additional person is a minor child. 
</P>
<P>
If the owner allowed other tenants with a similar size unit and rental 
agreement as you to have an extra adult in their apartment, and didn't allow 
you to have the child, there may be grounds for a discrimination action. 
Otherwise, probably not. 
</P>
<P>
If the "worst" happens, your owner will be required to give you a 30-day notice 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference Between Tenant and 'Lodger' 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a public-interest attorney from La Jolla, and I was astounded at your 
June 24 Apartment Life column. In it, you indicated that a "Renter Can Take 
Steps to Evict Roommate," then, proceeded to treat a housemate in the same 
manner as one would treat a tenant living in a residence separate and apart 
from the owner/landlord. 
</P>
<P>
When one shares his private home with someone, that someone is really a 
licensee, with a license to share the home and with certain financial 
considerations being exchanged. It is not an "assignment or sublease." 
</P>
<P>
I have rented my extra bedroom in my "owned" condo for years, and I have a 
written agreement that provides that either party can terminate on 10-days 
notice, or a week's notice. The law does not force me to continue for months to 
share the privacy of my kitchen, bathroom and home with an adverse party who I 
want out. 
</P>
<P>
If one were to take your column at face value, one would be stuck with the 
obnoxious housemate and intolerable personal living conditions for months! I 
have been on both ends of this for years and your column really upset me. Do 
you still believe this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. That column dealt with a tenant who rented out a portion of her rented 
apartment to another person, not her "owned" home or condo. 
</P>
<P>
You, probably, are referring to Civil Code Section 1964.5. It talks about, "The 
hiring of a room by a lodger on a periodic basic (like weekly or every 10 days) 
within a dwelling unit occupied by the owner. . . ." It clearly says, "This 
section applies only to owner-occupied dwellings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The code also talks about removing such "lodgers" from one's home. It says, 
"The lodger's removal from the premises may thereafter be effected pursuant to 
the provisions of Section 602.5 of the Penal Code. . . ." (If the lodger does 
not leave after the expiration of a notice at least as long as the rental 
period not exceeding one month, the police may be called to arrest the 
person.") 
</P>
<P>
In the question previously answered by us, our conclusion is the same. The 
person we described appeared to fit the description of a subtenant, whose 
tenancy must be terminated thorough an eviction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deposit Must Be Settled by Co-Tenants 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter and a friend signed a month-to-month rental agreement for an 
apartment that they shared in Los Angeles. After several months, my daughter 
decided to move out. She gave the landlord a 30-day notice to vacate. 
</P>
<P>
Her roommate planned to stay and pay all the rent. The landlord said my 
daughter's 30-day notice did not relieve her of her responsibility for the 
security deposit agreement. He said that both tenants would have to vacate to 
terminate the agreement. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes and no. Because your daughter signed a month-to-month rental agreement, 
instead of a lease, her "liability" for the agreement, including rent, ceases 
at the end of the 30-day notice period. So the owner is wrong about your 
daughter. She has an independent obligation to perform under the agreement, and 
an independent right to terminate her responsibilities under it. 
</P>
<P>
However, that does not mean that the owner of the apartment will refund your 
daughter her portion of any security deposit that he is holding on the 
apartment. She'll have to work that out with her roommate. The security deposit 
is only refunded when the "tenancy" ends, after the apartment is completely 
vacated.

SOUTHLAND SOILS NEED GARDENER'S SPECIAL CARE; 
</P>
<P>
IMPROVEMENTS: AT THE ROOT OF MANY A PLANT'S WOES ARE THE SOIL IT IS GROWING IN. 
ONE EXPERT HAS SOLUTIONS IN SPADES.

<P>
Although the climate in Southern California is ideal for growing plants, there 
is a common belief that most of the soil is poor. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Jim Barry, a Southland soil and tree expert. According to Barry, 
much misinformation exists concerning Southern California soils. 
</P>
<P>
Barry cites three commonly held myths about Southland soils: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Most are composed of hard clay and are almost impossible to work with. 
"Wrong," said Barry, "in fact, City Hall in Los Angeles sits on some of the 
best possible soil." 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Adding sand to clay soils will improve them. "Don't do it," said Barry, 
"although it sounds like a good practice, you end up with an unmanageable, 
concrete-like mess." 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Southern California soils lack nutrients and require heavy applications of 
fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
"Not true," said Barry. "Most Southland soils are fairly rich in nutrients and 
don't require much except for nitrogen and iron." 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who has spent 16 years working with and testing Southern California 
soils, heads Mobile Soil Labs and Barry Tree Service. He is a certified 
arborist and also a horticulture instructor at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barry, most Southland soils area generally either alluvial or 
marine. Alluvial soils are ideal for optimal plant growth. They are generally 
found in the low foothills, in basin areas such as the Los Angeles Basin, and 
near the dry river areas of the Los Angeles, San Gabriel and Santa Ana rivers. 
These soils are generally sandy loam-type soils. 
</P>
<P>
Marine soils are not necessarily found near the ocean -- they are located 
throughout Southern California, because millions of years ago much of the 
Southland lay under oceans. They are difficult soils and tend to be alkaline, 
saline -- or both. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit in these soils is a buildup of calcium carbonate. This type of soil 
tends to bind up nutrients so that they are not readily absorbable by plant 
roots. Most clay soils are marine soils. Incidentally, Barry said clay isn't 
all bad; some clay is important in soils because it holds in nutrients. The 
ideal sandy loam soils contain about 10% clay. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said that another soil problem occurs because most of the water delivered 
to Southern California has a relatively high salt content, which can damage 
plants. The water doesn't necessarily start out salty, but when it travels in 
canals through hot deserts or inland valleys, a significant amount evaporates, 
leaving a fairly high salt content. 
</P>
<P>
This high-saline water is acceptable for use on plants if the soil is porous 
enough to allow it to be flushed out periodically with deep irrigation. 
However, if water penetration is inadequate, it is possible that plant damage 
will occur. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in an area that has marine-type soils that are clay-like, alkaline, 
saline, or all of the above, Barry offers suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Clay soils, which are also usually alkaline can be improved by the addition of 
organic materials and gypsum. These two materials loosen the soil structure and 
allow for better penetration of water. With proper water penetration, soils can 
be flushed of accumulated salts. 
</P>
<P>
Which organic materials should be used? Barry recommends homemade compost or 
commercial products containing humus materials. Barry suggested avoiding cow or 
horse manures as they are typically high in salts. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barry, you should use 1 cubic yard of organic materials per 1,000 
square feet of soil surface. Work the materials deeply into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
If your soil is also alkaline (it can be tested with inexpensive kits available 
at most nurseries), add sulfur to it. Over a period of time, sulfur will 
acidify the soil and lower the alkalinity. This will allow for better 
absorption of soil nutrients by plants. 
</P>
<P>
If your plants turn yellow with iron chlorosis (iron isn't properly absorbed by 
the roots), Barry suggests adding iron sulfate to the soil. It both acidifies 
the soil and adds iron to it, getting quicker results than soil sulfur. Follow 
label directions for application rates. 
</P>
<P>
As for fertilizers, Barry said that most Southern California soils have good 
nutrient content. Of the three basic nutrients -- nitrogen, phosphorous and 
potassium -- only nitrogen usually needs to be added on a regular basis. 
Indeed, many commercial growers use only nitrogen fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
Of the secondary and trace elements, usually only iron needs to be added to the 
soil. And this isn't because iron is lacking in the soil, it's because the 
soil's high alkalinity prevents it from being absorbed by plant roots. 
</P>
<P>
How often should plants be irrigated? According to Barry, it depends upon your 
soil type. Heavy clay soils retain water and don't need to be irrigated as 
often as light sandy soils. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said that probably 80% of plants are watered either too often or 
incorrectly. The key when irrigating is to water deeply; as deep as the plant 
roots extend. This practice leeches the salts from the soil. By watering 
deeply, and not so often, the soil is allowed to dry out somewhat so plant 
roots can get sufficient air. 
</P>
<P>
In his role as an arborist, Barry has seen many trees that have died because of 
constantly soggy roots.

Kathy and Wendell Coates are saving for a down payment on their first home, but 
the amount of money they can set aside by next spring may not be enough. Their 
problem is shared by thousands of other black families who find it difficult, 
if not impossible, to make the leap from renting to owning a home. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies reported recently that 
3.5% of black renters in the United States are able to buy homes now, compared 
to 16.9% of whites. Lower incomes than whites and racial discrimination in 
buying and borrowing are the major barriers to black home ownership, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of blacks locked out of the housing market has changed little in 
30 years, said William C. Apgar Jr., acting director of Harvard's Joint Center 
for Housing Studies, which issued the report. 
</P>
<P>
A major cause is blacks' lack of money or property to pass on to their 
children, a problem that perpetuates itself, he said. Home ownership is "a 
wealth-accumulation vehicle," an important source of funds and savings for most 
white families. 
</P>
<P>
Many white purchasers, especially those buying their first homes, get help from 
their families through gifts, loans or inheritances. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard report said 13.6% of the total 29 million renters of all races in 
the United States could qualify for a mortgage to buy "the typical starter home 
in 1986," the latest year for which figures were available. 
</P>
<P>
The 3.5% of black renters who can buy assumes that they can make a down payment 
of 10% of the mortgage. If they had to make a 20% down payment, the amount most 
banks require, only 1.5% could purchase a house, according to the Harvard 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Renters, particularly those in high-cost areas, generally have a hard time 
saving money, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"With rent as high as it is now, it's taking all (of black renters') money, and 
they can't save for the down payment and closing costs. The odds are really 
against you," said Alyce Payne, a real estate agent who is black. 
</P>
<P>
The median income of black families nationally is $19,329 -- half the $33,915 
figure for whites as of March, 1989, the Census Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent report of family net worth -- its savings and major assets 
minus debts -- shows a much bigger gap between whites and blacks. The net worth 
of white families was nearly 12 times that of blacks when the report was issued 
in 1984 -- $39,135 for whites and $3,397 for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult, if not almost impossible, for blacks to make that 
transition" from renting to owning, agreed Leroy Hubbard, a housing activist 
and president of the Metropolitan Washington Housing Assn., a policy and 
research organization. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases they must "go out and borrow money, and work two or three jobs 
just to qualify for a loan. It's very hard for them to become a part of the 
American dream and, believe me, they want to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 45% of black households owned homes in 1986, compared to 70% for whites, 
and the value of blacks' homes lagged behind those of whites, the Harvard study 
said.

$400,000 ranked by dollar volume for the second quarter of 1990.

HOME IMPROVEMENT: HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN 'MANTA RAY' MITER JIG; 
</P>
<P>
CUTTING: WHEN USED WITH A TABLE SAW, IT IS DEAD ACCURATE AND WILL CUT STOCK 
WIDER THAN OTHER SYSTEMS CAN HANDLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.J. HAND, 1990, Los Angeles Times Syndicate 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you have a table saw, here's a simple jig you can make for it that will turn 
out perfect 45-degree miter cuts time after time. Sure, I have all kinds of 
factory-made miter tools, including a motorized miter box, but I made this jig 
for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- It will cut stock wider than any of my other systems can handle. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- It is dead accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Its only drawback is that you have to own a table saw to use it. If you don't 
have a table saw, perhaps you should think about getting one. Next to an 
electric drill, I think it's the most important and versatile tool you can own. 
And small bench-top models sell for under $150. 
</P>
<P>
OK, back to the jig. You can make the whole thing from scraps of plywood you 
may have lying around the garage. I like to use half-inch plywood for the base, 
and three-quarter-inch plywood for the triangular section on top. 
</P>
<P>
For the two guide rails that run beneath the base, a dense hardwood like maple 
is best, but you can get by with pine in a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
The dimensions shown in the sketch are for a rather large version I made to fit 
my big 10-inch table saw. If you have a small saw, you might want to scale 
things down a bit. None of the dimensions are really critical. 
</P>
<P>
Start by cutting the two rails that run under the jig. Cut these on your table 
saw, sizing them to fit perfectly in the saw's miter gauge slots. You don't 
want them so snug that they won't slide smoothly in the slots, but you don't 
want them too loose or they will allow the finished jig to wobble and produce 
sloppy cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Next, cut out the half-inch plywood base. When it's ready, lower the blade on 
the table saw. Place the two rails in the miter gauge slots, run a thin bead of 
glue down the top of each and carefully set the base in position over them. 
</P>
<P>
If you set your saw's rip fence 13 inches from the blade (for a base 26 inches 
wide) you can use it as a guide to position the base. Put a few heavy objects 
on top of the base to weight it down, and let the glue dry for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
When the glue is dry, check to see that the jig will slide smoothly in the 
table saw slots. You may have to sand the rails very lightly to loosen things 
up. I like to coat the rails and the bottom of the jib with paste wax to help 
assure smooth operation. 
</P>
<P>
Set aside the base and cut out the plywood triangle that will sit on top of it. 
This is the only critical step in the whole process. You must make sure that 
the triangle has a perfect 90-degree angle as shown in the sketch. Check this 
with a square, and if it's not perfect, trim it slightly and check it again. 
</P>
<P>
Happy with the 90-degree angle? Drill a pair of 1 1/2-inch holes through the 
triangle as shown in the sketch. The position of these isn't critical. Just put 
them about an inch from the edges of the triangle, and out of the line of cut. 
</P>
<P>
You'll stitch your thumbs in these holes when you use the jig, so you certainly 
don't want them positioned in your lane of cut. 
</P>
<P>
OK, raise the blade on your saw back up, place the jig in the slots on the saw, 
turn on the saw and cut a kerf to roughly the center of the jig. Then stop and 
turn off the saw. 
</P>
<P>
Your next step is to fasten the triangle in position on top of the base. You 
can do this with glue, or you can use screws. I prefer screws because they let 
me replace the triangle when it gets worn out with use. 
</P>
<P>
Position the triangle with its point aligned directly with the kerf you have 
just cut in the base. The saw kerf should bisect the 90-degree angle. Check 
this with a protractor. 
</P>
<P>
There should be 135 degrees from the saw kerf around to both faces of the 
triangle. Screw the triangle down with two or three 1 1/4-inch flat head screws 
and the jig is ready to use. 
</P>
<P>
To use, place a piece of stock against one face of the triangle. Place your 
thumb in the hole on that side, and use your fingers to hold the stock firmly 
in place. Turn on the saw and slide the jig into the blade until the cut is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Make a couple of test cuts -- both on the same side of the triangle. Place them 
together and check to see how they fit with a square. If you are off by more 
than a bit, you may want to realign the triangle, but for a slight inaccuracy, 
this isn't necessary. Why? Because the jig is designed to be self-compensating. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever you use it, you should cut mating parts on opposite faces of the 
triangle. Cut the right side of the joint on the right side of the triangle, 
and the left side of your joint on the left side of the triangle. Then if the 
triangle is slightly out of line, any inaccuracy will cancel out. One miter may 
be 46 degrees, but the other will be 44 and the assembled joint will come out 
to 90. Tips for use: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always use a good, sharp blade, preferably a quality carbide-tipped 
crosscut blade. If you don't want to spend the money for one of these, try a 
steel hollow-ground planner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always use the same blade and keep the kerfs in the base and triangle 
clean. If they fit the blade snugly, they'll help prevent chipping, and you can 
use them as visual guides to help align your cut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If your stock tends to slip against the triangle as you make a cut, face 
the edges of the triangle with strips of 80-grit sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, you may be wondering why I call this a manta ray miter jig. 
Simple. The triangle, with its two eye-like holes, reminds me of a manta ray.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: NEW AIR CONDITIONERS MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I must replace my old central air conditioner soon. I want one that 
is super-high-efficiency, reliable and quiet. What types of units are available 
to meet my needs? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There have been many recent significant improvements in 
residential-sized central air conditioners. Some of the new 
super-high-efficiency central units have efficiencies (called SEER) as high as 
17. Installing one of these can cut your cooling bills by more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The most energy-efficient central air conditioner uses a totally variable speed 
compressor and fan. This allows the unit to operate at maximum efficiency for 
varying cooling needs and weather conditions. On very hot days, it operates at 
a higher speed than on cooler days. An electronic microprocessor determines the 
most efficient operating speed. 
</P>
<P>
Since it doesn't cycle on and off as often, the more steady-state operation 
improves the efficiency and your comfort. The cooling output and air 
circulation are more constant throughout your home. It also operates more 
quietly at the lower speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Central air conditioners with two-speed compressors are also available with 
SEERs up to 15. (Your old single-speed air conditioner probably has a SEER of 
only 6 to 7). Another unit has a single-speed compressor, but a two-speed 
condenser fan to boost efficiency to more than 12. 
</P>
<P>
The scroll compressor design is now used in many of the super-high-efficiency 
air conditioners. Its advantages are its quiet operation, high efficiency and 
simplicity. The noise levels from a scroll compressor can be 10% to 20% lower 
than from a standard reciprocating compressor. 
</P>
<P>
With only a few moving parts, a scroll compressor is less prone to mechanical 
and lubrication breakdown. This makes it very reliable, and it actually becomes 
more efficient the older it gets as it wears in. 
</P>
<P>
When you select a central air conditioner, it is important to have it properly 
sized. Your contractor should do a detailed heat gain analysis of your house 
and economic pay-back analysis for units of various efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
An oversized unit not only operates inefficiently by cycling on and off too 
often, but it decreases the comfort level. In all but the very hottest weather, 
it won't run long enough to adequately dehumidify the air. This is where the 
variable- and multiple-compressors help. 
</P>
<P>
You can write for Utility Bills Update No. 394 showing a buyer's guide for 21 
manufacturers of super-high-efficiency central air conditioners, listing 
models, cooling capacities, rated efficiencies, sound levels, types of 
compressors and numbers of speeds. Please include $1.25 and a business-size 
return envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 
6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

Should Damper in Fireplace Be Closed? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a wood-burning fireplace with a brick chimney on the west side of the 
house. When I air condition in the summer, should I close the chimney damper or 
leave it open for natural ventilation? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are operating a central air conditioner, you should keep the chimney 
damper closed. The brick chimney holds the sun's heat well into the evening. 
This creates an upward draft and draws out cooled air. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't air condition, leave the chimney damper open. The natural draft 
from the warm chimney draws cool outdoor air in the windows at night. It is 
actually a form of free solar energy replacing an electric fan.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT: AUDIO SYSTEM: IS IT WORTH $12,000? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY SOMERFIELD, Somerfield is a syndicated home entertainment columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most-talked about subject in the press room at June's Consumer Electronics 
Show (CES) in Chicago was the Home THX Audio System. THX is the designation 
given to enhancements to the Dolby Stereo (surround) system used in motion 
picture houses around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The THX enhancements were masterminded by a team headed by Tomlinson Holman of 
Lucasfilms (as in George Lucas of "StarWars" fame). The Lucasfilm people found 
that their films sounded different in different theaters. They wanted their 
wonderful movies to sound the way the directors and other production people 
originally intended them to sound, no matter in which theater they were 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
So, they set out to discover how to make one theater sound just right. Once 
they had made one theater sound right, they drew up a set of specifications 
that would allow all theaters to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
The letters THX, depending upon who you ask, are either a tribute to Mr. Lucas' 
film, "THX 1138," or stand for Tom Holman, with an X for "experiment" thrown 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The THX theater system is made up of a variety of elements: acoustical 
treatments, amplifier specifications and loudspeaker designs. The end result is 
that if you're lucky enough to have a THX-spec theater near you, the films you 
see (and hear) there will sound exactly as the Lucasfilm people intended. And 
it will sound that way in every other THX theater in the world as well. 
</P>
<P>
Now, what about at home? When you play your copy of "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade," does it sound the way it does in a THX theater? No? Well, that is 
what the Home THX Audio System is supposed to deliver. Lucasfilm's THX division 
is licensing its technology for use in audio components designed for home 
entertainment systems. The first of these products made their debut at this 
summer's CES. 
</P>
<P>
I heard two demonstrations of THX systems at CES. The first was by Technics. 
The THX-licensed products exhibited by Technics included speaker systems, 
amplifiers and a surround-sound decoder/control unit. The second demonstration 
was a cooperative arrangement between two manufacturers: Lexicon 
(surround-sound decoder) and Snell Acoustics (speaker systems).

Lexicon showed their THX-equipped surround-sound decoder and a prototype 
multi-channel amplifier. Snell exhibited their THX-licensed speaker systems. 
I'm sorry to say that neither demo knocked my socks off, but of the two, the 
Technics was more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, neither demo was glitch-free. All the components on hand from 
the three manufacturers were prototypes, and they were displayed in typical, 
temporary "convention" spaces. The special laser disc used to demonstrate the 
equipment offered exciting, high-volume glimpses of various Lucasfilm 
productions, but lacked the "sparkle" I expected. All in all, neither demo was 
an exemplary example of a "Home THX Audio System." 
</P>
<P>
A short time after I arrived back home in San Francisco, I was offered the 
opportunity to hear another demonstration of the THX home system, this time at 
Lucasfilm headquarters on the Skywalker Ranch. I excitedly made the 20-minute 
drive, but unfortunately, have little to report. The same Lucasfilm demo disc 
was used again in this presentation, as well as some audio (CD) program 
material with which I was not familiar. The Lucasfilm laser disc seems to have 
a problem with the audio mix or equalization (it lacks high frequencies). Plus, 
the positioning of the speakers and arrangement of the room's furniture was 
less than ideal. I've been promised a rain check, and will eventually get the 
opportunity to hear a full demo with no excuses. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, I've been listening to my own surround-sound system very 
critically, and you know what? I really like it. I wonder about spending 
$12,000 (the price quoted for the Technics THX set up) for a system that isn't 
dramatically better than what I already own -- and my surround-sound system 
cost substantially less than $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Granted there are a few THX-type characteristics that I would like my system to 
have. I like the side-firing (dipole) surround speakers that the THX systems 
employ; they don't "speak" directly into your ears in a small room. 
</P>
<P>
I also like the way the THX system deals with the timbre of sounds that move 
from front to rear, or rear to front. In my system, because of the differences 
in front and rear speakers, when sounds move from front to rear (or the 
opposite direction) there is a noticeable change in sound characteristics 
(timbre). This is controlled well in a THX system. 
</P>
<P>
Until I can hear a THX system in a home-like environment, with hardware and 
software that are compromise-free, I can't really give it my thumbs-up or 
thumbs-down. While I feel that a Home THX Audio System can play back a film 
soundtrack with theater-like results, I also want to hear how well one of these 
systems reproduces music that I am familiar with. After all, few people can 
afford to have two sound systems -- one for music and another just for movies. 
</P>
<P>
What I can report, for now, is that these first, THX-approved products are 
quite expensive. The Lexicon THX-equipped surround-sound decoder is priced at 
$2,500, more than double the price of their best non-THX decoder. The Technics 
system is $12,000. Included in that price are three front speakers, two 
surround speakers, two sub-woofers, the amplifiers to drive all those speakers 
and a THX/surround-sound decoder/controller. Without the amplifiers the cost is 
$7,000. If you choose the seven speakers from Snell Acoustics, their price is 
$4,993.

SHOWDOWN NEARS ON HOUSING LEGISLATION; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: BILLS IN SENATE AND HOUSE WOULD HELP BUYERS AND RENTERS. BUT MORE 
COSTLY HOUSE MEASURE FACES BUSH VETO.

<P>
A showdown is set on the most far-reaching housing bill proposed in a decade 
when Congress returns from its summer recess next month. 
</P>
<P>
The House set the stage when it approved a $28-billion bill that would start a 
variety of programs to help first-time buyers, make it easier for 
government-subsidized renters to purchase their apartments and encourage 
production of new rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill -- approved by a 378-43 vote before members adjourned earlier 
this month -- would also make the loan program run by the Federal Housing 
Administration available to more borrowers while, at the same time, attempt to 
shore up the agency's shaky finances. 
</P>
<P>
But the House bill is far different and much more expensive than a 
$17.8-billion package that the Senate has approved and which the Bush 
Administration supports. 
</P>
<P>
A joint House-Senate conference committee will try to reach a compromise when 
Congress returns after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
If a compromise can't be reached, there's a chance that lawmakers will have to 
start all over again next year -- ending a three-year effort to pass the 
far-reaching legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the committee is successful in reaching a deal that's palatable to both 
sides, Bush says he'll veto the compromise if it contains key elements 
currently in the House bill -- including more spending for the construction of 
low-income housing and controversial changes to the popular FHA loan program. 
</P>
<P>
Such a veto would be difficult to override, once again forcing lawmakers to 
start from scratch when an all-new Congress convenes after the November 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that sparks will fly, but I'd say that the conference session 
will be long and arduous," said John Blount, a top lobbyist for the National 
Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors -- along with the National Assn. of Home Builders, several lenders 
trade groups and a handful of consumer groups -- back the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush and Jack Kemp, chief of the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Development, favor the less-costly legislation that has been approved by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill, dubbed "the National Affordable Housing Act," was authored by 
U.S. Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.). The companion 
bill is sponsored by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the powerful House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
There are two main differences between the proposal that has been passed by the 
Senate and the bill that has been approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
First, the House bill would have the federal government spend billions of 
dollars to encourage new construction and renovation of low-income rental 
units. The Senate proposal wouldn't spend nearly as much on low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most important difference between the two bills concern changes 
to the Federal Housing Administration's popular loan program, which is overseen 
by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate proposal, backed by Bush and Kemp, would require borrowers who use 
the FHA loan program to continue paying a mortgage-insurance premium equal to 
3.8% of their total loan amount. 
</P>
<P>
However, borrowers who make less than a 10% down payment would also have to pay 
an additional one-half of 1% "risk premium" on top of the 3.8% currently 
required. 
</P>
<P>
The surcharge would add about $40 to the monthly payment on a $100,000 loan at 
10%, according to the realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Kemp-backed Senate proposal would also require that borrowers pay 
two-thirds of their closing costs in cash, raising the amount of up-front money 
needed to get a $100,000 loan by about $1,266. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are needed, Kemp said, to make the FHA "actuarially sound." 
</P>
<P>
Although the primary FHA fund had a net worth of $2.6 billion at the end of the 
latest fiscal year, Kemp has said it will have "a negative net worth unless 
something is done" to stem its growing number of foreclosure losses. 
</P>
<P>
HUD analysts estimate that 35,000 Americans will immediately be knocked out of 
the housing market if the Kemp plan is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors, builders and others who oppose the plan say that number would be much 
higher -- perhaps as high as 250,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal supported by the Administration would turn the FHA program on its 
head," said Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), who played a key role in drafting 
the House plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are debating not only the future of the FHA program but of many young 
families who would like to purchase a home." 
</P>
<P>
Although the House plan is more complex, Vento and his supporters say it will 
give the FHA the financial boost it needs while, at the same time, be much 
easier on the nation's would-be home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The House proposal would essentially phase out over five years the 3.8% 
up-front insurance premium that borrowers must pay and instead require that a 
payment equal to 1.35% of the loan amount be paid when the loan closes. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers would also pay an annual "renewal fee" equal to .6% of the original 
loan amount. 
</P>
<P>
"In short, the House plan would keep the FHA program open to people who have 
only small down payments and transform it into a true 'pay-as-you-go' system," 
said Michelle Meier, an executive and lobbyist with the nonprofit Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Meier's organization, which has successfully lobbied in the past for regulatory 
changes that have benefited borrowers, has joined realtors and builders in 
support of the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
Realtor officials plan to meet with Kemp on Tuesday in an effort to persuade 
him that the House proposal would "ensure the FHA's future viability but also 
keep it open to the people who need it most," lobbyist Blount said. 
</P>
<P>
"The President listens to Mr. Kemp," Blount said. "If we can convince Mr. Kemp 
that the House's proposal is better, we hope to avoid a veto." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how Kemp responds to the realtors' arguments will play a key role in 
what happens to the two bills next. 
</P>
<P>
If Kemp and Bush drop their opposition to the House's plans for the FHA, the 
House-Senate conference committee will likely have an easier time passing a 
compromise measure that Bush can sign into law. 
</P>
<P>
But if Kemp and Bush can't be swayed, conferees from the Senate and House are 
probably in for some contentious debates. 
</P>
<P>
If a compromise is reached but Bush vetoes it, the veto could be hard to 
override. The President has killed 13 measures during his tenure and hasn't had 
a single one overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, Congress is set to adjourn for the year Oct. 5. Even 
if lawmakers can hammer out a compromise before then, they might not have time 
to attempt a veto override. 
</P>
<P>
Bush could also utilize a "pocket veto" by simply refusing to sign a compromise 
measure. If he does, Congress would be denied the chance of even attempting to 
override the President. 
</P>
<P>
The current Congress has struggled for nearly three years to formulate the two 
bills that the conference committee will take up next month. But all 435 
members of the House are up for reelection this year, and so is one-third of 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
If a compromise isn't passed and signed into law by Bush, a new Congress will 
have to start from scratch when it convenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years of blood, sweat and tears are riding on Congress and the 
Administration," lobbyist Blount said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't predict how it'll all turn out, but I'll tell you this: The next month 
or two will be crucial to the future of America's housing market." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOUSING BILL HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
Both the House and the Senate agree that first-time buyers and low-income 
renters need help to beat the fast-rising cost of housing. Here are some of the 
highlights of the two housing bills that are scheduled to go to a joint 
conference committee next month: 
</P>
<P>
* Establishment of a "national housing trust fund." The new fund would help 
first-time buyers by subsidizing their down payment and closing costs. Mortgage 
rates will also be subsidized: Borrowers would pay no more than 6%. Subsidies 
would be repaid when the home is sold. 
</P>
<P>
* Rental housing production. Authorize low-interest repayable advances to 
nonprofit groups, private developers and public housing agencies for up to 50% 
of the cost to build, buy or renovate "affordable" rental housing. A portion of 
the units would have to be set aside for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
* Community housing partnership. Grants and loans would be made to states, 
municipalities and nonprofit groups to maintain, rehab, buy or build homes. The 
homes would then be rented or sold to low- and moderate-income people. Project 
sponsors would put up $1 for every $3 provided by the program. 
</P>
<P>
* Public and Indian home ownership. HUD would hold national competitions to 
help public housing tenants buy their homes. Grants would be made to develop 
resident management corporations and home ownership plans. 
</P>
<P>
* Multifamily and single-family home ownership. Would enable groups to buy and 
fix up property currently owned and operated by federal, state and local 
governments. Properties would then be sold to low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
* Vacant public housing. HUD would provide grants to public housing authorities 
to rehab or raze vacant public housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
* Family self-sufficiency. A new program would be established to coordinate 
various public-housing programs and subsidies to help families get off public 
assistance.

Favorite Rose Blooms Produce Two 'Noses' 
</P>
<P>
Q: Double Delight is my favorite rose in the garden, but the blooms sometimes 
turn into two "noses." Is this common, or am I doing something wrong? 
</P>
<P>
A: Double Delight -- which, by the way, is the most popular rose in the country 
-- does occasionally produce double-nosed blooms. Some experts think this 
condition is caused by overfeeding, so if you're fertilizing heavily, try 
cutting back. 
</P>

Unsterilized Soil to Blame for Gnats 
</P>
<P>
Q: Hordes of little black gnats seem to hover above the soil in my houseplants. 
What are they, and how can I get rid of them? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fungus gnats hatch from eggs deposited in unsterilized potting soil. They 
become active when plants are kept damp. To get rid of them, try a new diazinon 
product called Whitmire Ultra Guard; or you can use Schultz houseplant spray, a 
pyrethrum-based low-toxicity insecticide. To avoid these gnats in the future, 
use only sterilized potting soil. Mary Ellen Guffey

Canker Likely Cause of Cypress Tree Problem 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: What is killing my cypress trees, and what can I do about it? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Very likely your trees are succumbing to cypress canker, a disease that 
is devastating cypress trees in the Southland. According to Bill Nelson, a tree 
expert at Pacific Tree Farms, the disease is usually limited to Monterey or 
Leyland cypress trees. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are some expensive treatments that will prolong the tree's 
agony, once the disease is established, the tree's days are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson suggests that you replace them with Tecate, Arizona or Italian 
cultivars, all of which have demonstrated resistance to cypress canker. Nelson 
also notes that regular watering and proper fertilizing will help prevent 
cypress canker on susceptible varieties.

Which Chili Pepper Wins as the Hottest? 
</P>
<P>
Q: My friend and I have a bet on over which is the world's hottest chili 
pepper. He says it is the Tabasco; I say it is the serrano. Who wins? 
</P>
<P>
A: Neither of you. The habanero is the world's hottest pepper. This torrid 
delight is many times hotter than either the Tabasco or serrano. If you want to 
see for yourself, some supermarkets are now carrying the powdered form of this 
incendiary pepper.

New Yorker Erred in Adding Lime to Soil 
</P>
<P>
Q: We moved here last year from Upstate New York where we had always had 
marvelous vegetable gardens. The garden we planted here last spring produced 
poor results although we cultivated, fertilized and limed the soil and watered 
regularly. What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
A: You made a common mistake that gardeners from other areas of the country 
often make when they move to Southern California -- you limed the soil. 
Although this is standard practice in many areas of the country where the soil 
is too acid, in most of the Southland the soil is too alkaline. Instead of an 
application of lime, most of our soils require an addition of peat moss or soil 
sulfur to raise the acidity. Bill Sidnam

Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. -- 
Leviticus 18:22 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't uncommon for Ray Halm, the president of Christ College Irvine, to get 
to his office by 6:30 a.m., but it was unusual to have a student waiting for 
him when he got there. So when Perry Miller greeted Halm outside the 
administration building in the early morning chill of Jan. 27, 1989, Halm knew 
it wasn't for idle chatter. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, Miller told Halm he had been grappling with a moral dilemma for a 
month: Over the holidays, he and his family had been watching a daylong TV 
broadcast of Christmas music from the Los Angeles Music Center, featuring a 
succession of choral groups. As the camera panned an all-male group, Miller's 
sister recognized Bud Bisbee, CCI's highly regarded choir director and an 
associate professor of music. She called in other family members, but their 
enthusiasm for Bisbee's role soon turned to shock when the group was identified 
as the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Miller believed that the Scriptures were emphatic in the condemnation of 
homosexuality. To the conservative Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church, the 
arm that supported Christ College, homosexuality is a sin, an aberration of 
God's perfect plan. And so Miller pondered: as a student at Christ College, as 
a Christian, where did his duty lie? If a faculty member were homosexual, 
didn't he have a responsibility to tell someone? 
</P>
<P>
On that January morning in Halm's office, Miller unburdened himself. Halm 
thanked him and said he would handle it. They prayed together. The meeting 
lasted 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Not even seven in the morning and already Halm knew it was going to be one of 
those days. In seminary, he had been told that the toughest balancing act he 
would ever perform was that between biblical law and Gospel; in other words, 
balancing God's condemnation of sin and his forgiveness of it. And unless Perry 
Miller and his entire family had been hallucinating on Christmas Eve, Halm had 
a major headache on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Bisbee wasn't just another faculty member. Since starting full time in 
1980, three years after CCI opened, he had virtually built its music program. 
Music has always been an integral part of the Lutheran Church -- dating to 
Martin Luther himself and with a lineage that includes Johann Sebastian Bach. 
In that tradition, Bisbee's choral groups had become a centerpiece of the small 
school's out-of-state recruiting and public relations effort. Outside of Halm 
and perhaps one or two others, Bisbee might well be CCI's most visible faculty 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, everyone at CCI knew Bisbee, the mile-a-minute perfectionist who never 
seemed to have time for anything but his music. And if no one at the school 
knew much about Bisbee's personal life, the prevailing opinion was that the 
slight, bespectacled, middle-aged man couldn't possibly have one, so consumed 
was he by his music. 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, Bisbee did have a private life -- a life that seemed to the 
people at CCI to be energized by music, but which was in reality a dull, lonely 
existence where solace was found at the piano. 
</P>
<P>
On that January morning in his office, Halm was about to learn about the 
private side of Bud Bisbee for the first time. Three hours after Perry Miller 
handed off his bombshell, Halm summoned Bisbee to his office and asked if he 
were gay. Bisbee said he was and always had been. It was the way God made him, 
Bisbee said, and although only a fool would have proclaimed it to anyone at the 
college, he wasn't ashamed of it, either. In fact, Bisbee said, joining the Gay 
Men's Chorus was the best thing he had ever done. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't what Halm wanted to hear from the mild-mannered Music Man. 
</P>
<P>
From that moment, the clock began ticking for the end of Bisbee's career at 
CCI. His disclosure about being gay and his eventual dismissal for refusing to 
quit the chorus would affect a host of personal and professional friendships 
and leave him today, at 55, without a full-time job in a field already glutted 
with applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Bisbee learned a swift lesson that morning -- a lesson that gay rights 
activists say gays have long experienced: that disclosure about homosexuality 
can be tantamount to exile. If there is no voluminous record of case histories, 
those activists say, it is because many gays won't risk the ridicule or 
harassment that comes with publicizing their plight. 
</P>
<P>
One might logically have assumed that Bisbee would also quietly slip away. He 
had developed confrontation-avoidance and artful dodging about unpleasant 
topics to a high level of art. Characteristically, at first he didn't even seem 
angered by his dismissal. Once, while a teary-eyed friend explained to Bisbee 
that he was trying to enlist support for him, Bisbee said, "Why are you taking 
this so hard?" 
</P>
<P>
Slipping into denial was as easy as dressing in the morning. Once in the gay 
chorus, however, Bisbee found he wasn't alone. "It's amazing how many of these 
guys in this gay men's chorus have been married and have a family. There's 
denial every place you look," he says. "The fag jokes all over the place, 
you're a piece of dirt -- and that's all you heard in the church, every place 
you look, that's all you hear -- you can't help but internalize that. I knew I 
was gay, but it never occurred to me that anyone could like me. I recognized 
that I could like people, but it never occurred to me that someone would be 
interested in me. Just me as an individual." 
</P>
<P>
Today, with encouragement from friends and his own sense of justice, Bisbee is 
taking on the church. It is as though by coming out of the closet, Bisbee is 
wearing a whole new suit of clothes. "If this kind of thing had come up several 
years ago, I would have been destroyed," he says. "I still don't know quite 
where I am in life, but I have no doubt that I'm gay, and I have no guilt about 
that. But it has not made life any easier, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Bisbee was fired with a year left on his contract. He has enlisted the aid of a 
gay-rights attorney to challenge the termination and to be paid for the third 
year of his contract. In addition, he is pursuing appeals through the college 
and the Missouri Synod, forcing the church to publicly defend its actions and 
review its policies. 
</P>
<P>
That is the stuff for lawyers. The human drama goes beyond a year's salary and 
contract language. 
</P>
<P>
In a larger sense, by publicizing his homosexuality, Bisbee is asking who 
rightfully decides who will sit at God's table? After his 30 years of service 
to the church, during which his musical ministry has reached thousands, who is 
entitled to cast the first stone at him? 
</P>
<P>
What if, just what if, Bisbee asks, the Bible isn't as clear as it seems on 
homosexuality? 
</P>
<P>
To see Bud Bisbee scurrying around the pastoral CCI campus was to think that he 
was always behind schedule. So much music, so little time. It was a 
longstanding Bisbee trademark: Students of his from Lutheran High School in Los 
Angeles in the early 1960s talk of him walking "90 m.p.h." and getting 
everything done at the last minute; an associate from the late 1970s says 
Bisbee "put in unduly long hours to get everything prepared. He expected 
excellence; in order to get it absolutely perfect, he ran a pretty tough 
choir." In the 1980s, Halm saw in Bisbee a "perfectionist to the nth degree. . 
. . Even though I might want or need him to perform earlier (than scheduled), 
he would not have that choir perform until he was ready." 
</P>
<P>
His meticulousness wasn't just reserved for students -- Bisbee would do the 
same with adult volunteers in the community choir he also conducted at CCI. 
Stopping in front of some poor soul at rehearsal, Bisbee might well ask, "What 
are you singing the wrong notes for?" 
</P>
<P>
But on balance, Bisbee had the golden touch. "I've been at this (church work) 
since 1963," Halm says, "and I never met a choir director for whom I had 
greater respect. One thing Bud could do better than anyone in our church was 
create programs. He has a very creative side to him. He might have a piece done 
by hand bells, which would be highly sophisticated, extremely complex music 
which would almost spellbind the audience with how rapidly the performers had 
to move. He might follow that by having a student reach under a table and pull 
out a Mickey Mouse hat and do something like 'It's a Small World.' No one was 
ever bored by a Bud Bisbee program." 
</P>
<P>
Bud Bisbee's main critic was Bud Bisbee. His intellectual side told him he was 
good at what he did, but his psychological side resisted. "I had been extremely 
successful at both high schools before I came to Christ College," he says. 
"It's difficult for me to say that because I had such, well -- and I still 
haven't gotten over it -- such low self-confidence and low self-image that it's 
very difficult for me to say I was good at something." 
</P>
<P>
Without intimate friends to bolster his confidence, Bisbee lived a life on 
emotional automatic pilot. "After all this stuff happened, I went to a 
therapist and he asked me who I talked to when I was growing up. It sort of hit 
me that I didn't have anybody. I just assumed that was the way it was. It 
didn't really bother me one way or the other. I just grew up alone. . . . We 
would have discussions in the chorus on how when you're growing up, coming to 
terms with yourself, you have no role models. Growing up is always hell except 
for a lucky few. Everything you hear is negative, negative." 
</P>
<P>
We are talking in the comfort of Bisbee's Irvine townhouse. His living room is 
dominated by a Steinway grand piano. There is no television downstairs -- the 
fulfillment of a pledge Bisbee made years ago not to foul the air where a piano 
stood. We are talking three months after a CCI appeals committee turned down an 
appeal of his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
He recounted a story about how he heard a junior high classmate play a 
Paderewski minuet at a recital and thought it was the most beautiful thing he 
had ever heard. He goes over to the piano and plays a couple bars of the piece. 
"I knew then I had to play the piano; it was one of the strongest things that 
ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Abandoned by his father and raised by his mother and stepfather, neither of 
whom he is close to, Bisbee left his small Wisconsin hometown for college and 
essentially left his home life behind. He set out on what has become a lifetime 
course of traversing two worlds that couldn't be further apart: being gay in a 
strict church school environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have gay friends as I entered middle age. I had a small circle of 
straight friends, mostly from those I taught in high school. I always had 
trouble with relationships, even friend relationships. I was really quite 
unhappy, and I guess on some level it got to be where the job wasn't enough 
anymore," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If you were that unhappy for so many years, I ask, how could you put so much 
verve and enthusiasm into such a joyous art as choral music? "Well," he says, 
with a half-hearted laugh, "I'm a pretty good actor. I can put on a good show 
and no one would ever know anything was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For your entire adult life? "I did," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years as a bachelor teacher in a conservative church setting and your 
sexuality was never brought up? "I got very skillful at turning the 
conversation the other way," Bisbee says. "If people said, 'When are you going 
to get married?' -- I got those all the time -- I learned how to deflect it. My 
answer was that no one had asked me yet, and then I'd move on to something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Over the winter of 1987-88, he took a friend's suggestion that he join a 
self-help group. "At that time, I didn't think I would ever feel anything 
again. I thought I was absolutely dead inside. I just didn't think I had any 
feelings at all in any way. I'd been squelched for so long. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But the workshops helped. "When you finish the workshops, you're supposed to 
invite your friends to the ceremonies. That was one of the first times that I 
could even express to my very closest friends that they were important to me. 
It always sort of puzzled me. I liked them, but it always sort of puzzled me 
why they liked me." 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, he went to a concert of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los 
Angeles. He had never belonged to a gay group, marched in a gay demonstration 
or had a sexual relationship. Aside from the company of his own thoughts, his 
only real contact with the gay world came from reading gay novels. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, fighting himself all the way, Bisbee went alone to one of the 
group's rehearsals at the Hollywood Methodist Church in Los Angeles. "He was 
super-shy that night," remembers Jon Bailey, the chorus director and a music 
professor at Pomona College in Claremont. Bailey also realized what Bisbee was 
risking. "I was really excited to find someone who was also a college 
professor. We didn't talk a lot that night, but I have some acquaintance with 
the Missouri Synod, and I think I said something like, 'Oh, my word.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't go back the second time," Bisbee says. "I always felt uneasy 
in social situations, and of course I didn't know a soul. I didn't feel 
comfortable at all." 
</P>
<P>
But he did go back. The initial unease was soothed by the bonding with other 
gays. "I didn't have any clear-cut agenda. I just knew this was a place where I 
could go and be among other gay people in an environment where it was OK." 
</P>
<P>
The more time he spent, the more the duality of his life weighed on him. One 
gay friend in the chorus couldn't believe that Bisbee didn't openly discuss his 
gayness with others. Bisbee tried to explain that he lived in two different 
worlds and that they were "absolutely separate." 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore the duality, he got a variation on the same theme from 
Christ College after he disclosed his homosexuality. "They had such a terrible 
time understanding why I had to join a gay chorus," Bisbee says. "Why couldn't 
I just go join a choir. They couldn't understand that. It wasn't just the 
chorus; it was more. It was that belonging. Being in the chorus means a great 
deal to me, and I know that feeling is widespread in the chorus. It's 
incredible how much pain there is in that group." 
</P>
<P>
Chorus members are bonded by their common plight of being gay in a society 
colored with homophobia, but also, of course, by the AIDS specter. "There is an 
incredible warmth of caring between members," Bailey says. "We've lost almost 
35 members. There are people singing who are sick and every week report on 
who's in the hospital and who died. And we sing for lots of funerals." 
</P>
<P>
Those feelings tapped long-dead nerves in Bisbee. That semester, he believes, 
he was a better teacher than he had ever been. 
</P>
<P>
With Christmas, 1988, approaching, the chorus was invited to sing at the 
televised Christmas pageant at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, faced with the risk of being discovered, Bisbee had a fundamental 
decision to make: Should he sing in front of the cameras? 
</P>
<P>
"First, I had decided not to do it. Then the closer it got, I just decided, no, 
I was part of the group, I should do it. It was the first year the group had 
been invited; it was a huge victory, because they'd been trying for years to 
get invited." 
</P>
<P>
There was a pivotal moment, he believes, when his course became clear. During 
rehearsals, he was on an airplane and passing the time by studying the music 
the chorus planned to sing at Christmas. One song, "Family," was from the 
musical "Dreamgirls." 
</P>
<P>
 We are a family, like a giant tree branchin' out toward the sky/ 
</P>
<P>
 We are a family, we are so much more than just you and I. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a family, like a giant tree/ 
</P>
<P>
 Growin' stronger, growin' wiser, and we are growin' free. 
</P>
<P>
As Bisbee studied the lyrics, he says, he realized tears were rolling down his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his best friends, Larry and Sue Gerling of Whittier -- high school 
students of Bisbee's 25 years ago -- were apprehensive. Larry Gerling's parents 
had "adopted" Bisbee years ago when he first came out to California from the 
Midwest, inasmuch as he lived alone and was a strong influence in tapping their 
son's musical interests. If there was a big Gerling family affair, chances are 
Bisbee would be there. By the end of his high school career, Larry, now 42, 
knew Bisbee was gay, but never told his parents, knowing what their reactions 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
Larry and Sue knew Bisbee had joined the chorus. As lifelong Lutherans, both of 
whom still work in a Lutheran church in Whittier, they knew the stakes. "I 
wanted real bad to call him up right before and say, 'Bud, don't do it,' Sue 
Gerling said, "just don't do it, OK?' But my thinking was that he was a big boy 
and if this is what he needs to do. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"It was what he needed to do," Larry interjected. 
</P>
<P>
At the Chandler Pavilion, Bisbee was a jumble of emotions. "I must say when we 
walked out on the stage, with all those lights, and I saw another member of the 
chorus in the audience, an elementary school teacher, I thought, 'Oh, my gosh.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Bud Bisbee was anxious as he left Ray Halm's office on that January morning. "I 
think I was slipping into my denial mode. I just sort of denied that the 
incident was as serious as they saw it, and I probably refused to look at the 
possibility I would lose my job immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Halm was in no such mode. He knew full well the magnitude of the problem, 
replaying it in his mind. Bud said he'd been celibate all his life. The church 
position was that the propensity for homosexuality wasn't a sin, but that 
homosexual behavior was. Maybe the situation was salvageable. But then there 
was the problem of his joining the gay chorus. How could Bud be so cavalier as 
to do that without considering the consequences? No, staying with the gay 
chorus was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few days, Halm met or spoke by telephone with a number of CCI 
faculty members and administrators and synodical officials. Halm's own notes 
from those first conversations show that, from the start, Bisbee and the 
college were walking parallel lines that probably could never intersect. 
</P>
<P>
Halm wanted Bisbee to resign, but things were put on hold until after a CCI 
Board of Regents meeting scheduled for Feb. 9. The board, however, decided not 
to fire Bisbee outright and instead offered terms that could save Bisbee's job. 
The terms stipulated that he: 
</P>
<P>
* Drop out of the gay chorus. 
</P>
<P>
* Remain celibate. 
</P>
<P>
* Acknowledge that homosexuality is a sin and encourage others with a similar 
propensity to practice abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
* Seek pastoral counseling. 
</P>
<P>
If Bisbee agreed, the board suggested, the synod would review its entire 
position on homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Bisbee agreed to the terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated myself when I was writing up the letter (agreeing to the conditions), 
and I hated myself the next day," Bisbee says. "In some ways, I sold out. I 
wasn't true to what I felt was right." He was motivated largely, he says, by 
Halm's promise that the church would re-examine the homosexual issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bisbee remained on the faculty for the duration of the 1988-89 term. A 
long-planned sabbatical for the 1989-90 term took him out of the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
But in the fall of 1989, Bisbee rejoined the chorus, thus violating the terms 
of his agreement. "While I was out of the chorus, I began to realize I'd made 
the wrong decision. I felt myself drying up again. I had been deprived of my 
support group. I could call them up on the phone, but it wasn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
The college found out he had rejoined the chorus, and on Oct. 13, 1989 -- a 
Friday the 13th -- the regents began dismissal proceedings. On Dec. 12, Halm 
sent Bisbee his termination letter, saying the dismissal stemmed from his 
reneging on his agreement with the board, for conduct "unbecoming a Christian" 
and for failing to uphold the doctrinal position of the synod. It also said, in 
part: "Bud, the work of the church moves forward but slowly. Yet it is my hope 
that in the years to come we will see the people of God be more articulate in 
our expression regarding homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
On April 18 of this year, Bisbee lost his appeal through a committee named by 
the college. In upholding the firing, the appeals committee added: "We regret 
that Christ College has lost a talented, dedicated musician and teacher and 
that there was and is no place within the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod where 
individuals who struggle with their homosexuality can go for counsel and 
support." 
</P>
<P>
While Bisbee took his medicine, his best friends, the Gerlings, were becoming 
increasingly upset. Larry, raised in a strongly Lutheran household, had first 
grappled with various biblical interpretations as a collegian. Sue, while a 
little more philosophical about the workings of the church, was equally 
disturbed by the firing. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what it is," Sue Gerling said in their living room one evening, "when 
you really care about somebody and you see them being crucified for no good 
reason -- there's nothing to describe how terrible that feels, and then when 
you feel totally helpless to do anything about it. . . . The other thing is 
partly shame, because here we have been a part of this church, we work in the 
church, we've been raised this way. Now our church is treating someone we love 
very much with such disdain." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel betrayed," Larry says. "The church that I grew up with and loved and 
espoused all this wonderful doctrine of God's love and then the church does 
this. What's incredible is that if Bud were to quit the chorus, he could have 
kept his job, which means that the church is saying it's OK to call yourself 
gay, just don't act on it and don't associate with sinners. That's what Jesus 
did all the time. If Jesus criticized anybody, it was church leaders for saying 
you guys are playing the hypocrite." 
</P>
<P>
Although some biblical scholars question the interpretation that the Bible 
condemns homosexuality, Gerling concedes the point. 
</P>
<P>
So you just don't believe those verses, I ask him. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought much about homosexuality until Bud's situation came up," Larry 
says. "When I had to discuss it with him or Sue or other friends, I hadn't 
thought much about it, so I couldn't even make my own decision about whether 
it's right or wrong or a sin or not a sin. And, of course, to call 
homosexuality not a sin when the Bible clearly says it is, to contradict the 
Bible, I'm trained not to do that. But it was interesting and very freeing for 
me to come out and say, 'I don't think it's a sin.' Even if he were to develop 
a relationship with another person and have a sexual relationship, as horrible 
as society says that it is, I don't see it as horrible. I think it's a 
wonderful thing because I know my relationship with Sue is a wonderful thing 
and if he can have anything like we have, everybody deserves something like 
that, whether they're the same sex or not. I just don't believe that passage. 
That's what it comes down to." 
</P>
<P>
Although the church sees a distinction between homosexual propensity and 
behavior, Bisbee thinks it's a distinction without a difference. "It's a phony 
separation, totally illogical. It's incredibly offensive that they think they 
have the right to deny to any human being the possibility of relating and 
having a loving relationship with another human being, regardless of what sex 
they are. What does that have to do with love between two people? It has 
nothing to do with it. And besides, of your whole life, how much time do you 
spend in bed?" 
</P>
<P>
Ray Halm didn't want to fire Bud Bisbee, but neither does he have any 
misgivings about the correctness of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not uncomfortable with the teaching of the church that homophile behavior 
is sinful in God's sight," he says, speaking in measured tones. "That's not at 
issue for me. What is at issue is the place of the individual who has homophile 
propensity but who copes by the grace of God with that condition. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
After the Bisbee case surfaced, Halm says, he began reading on the subject of 
whether homosexuality was "reversible." He says he wasn't able to reach any 
conclusions, but he didn't consider that the issue, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to find a counselor who said the condition of homosexuality is an 
effect of the fall into sin," Halm says. "It is a woefully unfortunate 
situation, and the individual must be helped to cope with that propensity to 
sin, even as other people must be helped to cope with other propensities to 
sin." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, I asked Halm, you're asking any gay member of the church to 
remain celibate for life. "Or," Halm says, "even if the individual did not 
remain celibate, even if there were moments of falling, that the individual 
would have those moments of relapse not from absolute defiance of the law of 
God, but from his own weakness -- and having done that, would return to God 
asking for forgiveness. The fact that one has committed adultery doesn't mean 
one is forever castigated from heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Given that view, Halm and Bisbee grew ever further apart. "Bud began to express 
his belief that a homosexual relationship entered into with sincerity and 
conducted with fidelity would be as pleasing in the eyes of God as a 
heterosexual relationship entered into with such sincerity and fidelity," Halm 
says. "Both of those views are diametrically opposed to the Bible and our 
church." 
</P>
<P>
And, I asked, there's no middle ground? "There is no middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
The Bud Bisbee matter hasn't existed in a vacuum in the Lutheran Church. In 
July, two San Francisco congregations were disciplined by another Lutheran 
Synod (considered less conservative than the Missouri Synod) for ordaining 
three gay ministers who refused to take celibacy vows. On July 20, members of 
Lutherans Concerned -- a national group that addresses the gay issue within the 
church -- marched on the Chicago headquarters of that branch of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Hooper, pastoral counsel to Lutherans Concerned in Los Angeles, said that 
although many biblical scholars don't accept the literal interpretation of the 
Bible's apparent condemnation of homosexuality, Bud Bisbee's ouster from the 
church isn't atypical. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear stories constantly, but most are covered up because most people are 
not willing to let them become public. They're ashamed of the loss of a job, 
they may not be real confident in the fact they're gay, and so they're 
completely deflated when they're suddenly attacked for who they are. They don't 
have the will to stand up and say they haven't done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper thinks the church eventually will modify its stance. "We're moving in 
the direction of acceptance, not just tolerance. More and more individuals are 
telling stories, coming out to parents, spouses, coming out to their children, 
coming out to family and friends, and they're finding that on a one-to-one 
basis, people's minds change." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Bisbee is looking for full-time work, having accepted a 
part-time job for the coming year at Pomona College in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
And the players in the 20-month-old issue hold fast to their positions.

Ray Halm: "It is not uncommon for us to want to find a way to soften God's 
language, to want to find a way to soften his attitude toward things, to want 
to make him more tolerant. But when He speaks, He generally speaks so as to be 
understood." 
</P>

Sue Gerling: "I'm mad at my family, my friends. I'm just very angry about it, 
and I'm afraid I'll flare if someone says the wrong thing. I'm mad at my 
mother, who's mad at Larry for always being mad at the church. . . . But I 
strip it down to its bare meaning, which makes it real simple for me. What am I 
here for? I'm here to love and care about people, no matter who they are or 
where they are. Of course, I fail at that all the time, but that was Jesus' 
goal. He associated with all the sinners . . . and to bring the message that 
they were loved. Gay people need to hear that they are loved. Boy, do they. And 
if the church isn't telling them that, there's something wrong. But I'm going 
to stay in the stupid church, because I'm going to be one in the church who 
tells them they're loved." 
</P>

Bud Bisbee: "I remember one of the meetings we had, with President Halm, and 
academic dean (Shang Ik) Moon was there, and he was trying to say, 'Nothing's 
really changed, and we don't feel any different about you.' I usually don't say 
anything, but I said, 'How can you say that? Everything is changed. I'm being 
fired, I'm being told I'm not good enough to be in a synodical classroom over 
something over which I have no control, as if I had a certain hair color. And 
you sit there and say everything is the same, nothing's changed, it's all OK. 
Well, no, it isn't OK, and nothing is the same.' "

<P>
Fifteen aides to county supervisors got tickets to the ballet. Two planning 
commissioners played complimentary golf. And veteran Supervisor Thomas F. Riley 
was presented with a $150 cowboy belt buckle. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Mission Viejo Co. and its affiliates have given those and 
other gifts to elected and appointed officials throughout Orange County and 
beyond. They have also been significant campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, some of that generosity has stirred controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner C. Douglas Leavenworth, who accepted $1,200 worth of golf 
games, theater tickets and other gifts over the past five years, may have 
violated conflict-of-interest law by subsequently voting on matters affecting 
the development firm, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Leavenworth says that he did nothing wrong and that the gifts he received from 
the company didn't influence his votes. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not the first time that the Mission Viejo Co. has found its 
political activity under a spotlight. During the past several years, records 
and interviews show, the firm has blended contributions, gifts and scorching 
retaliatory campaigns against its opponents in a mix that has earned it a 
reputation as the most politically pugnacious developer in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and other political players traditionally use a combination of 
carrot and stick to wield their influence, and in that the Mission Viejo Co. is 
no different. But the company, a wholly owned subsidiary of New York-based 
Philip Morris Cos. Inc., has shown a particular fondness for playing rough. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the company has been successful, and other times it has failed 
miserably. It has nearly always been controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"They are so antagonistic and so out of the mainstream," said Gregory A. Hile, 
an attorney who has tangled with the company and who has represented both 
developers and slow-growth advocates. "They're bullies, and they're very, very 
nasty to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
That view is widely echoed by environmentalists, by some county officials and 
even by other developers. Indeed, the company's relationship with the county's 
development community is at times tenuous: In 1986, the Mission Viejo Co. 
resigned from the local Building Industry Assn. because its leaders criticized 
county planning operations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite vocal criticism in many quarters, the company does have its defenders. 
Supervisors Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez, for instance, have each praised the 
firm for its contributions to Orange County sports and arts. 
</P>
<P>
And even while observers often savage the company's political practices, rarely 
does anyone criticize its homes or its planned communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally think the company is regarded pretty well," said Ben Meharg, a 
Mission Viejo planning commissioner. "They've done a decent job with this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Company Vice President David A. Celestin declined a request to be interviewed 
for this article, and Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the company, said 
officials with the firm do not discuss contributions to political causes except 
in general terms. 
</P>
<P>
"We support candidates who believe in free enterprise, good planning and good 
government," Wetzel said. "That's our response to all questions dealing with 
political contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Although not a major contributor on the scale of the Irvine Co. -- which has 
given $2.2 million to political causes and candidates since the beginning of 
1987 -- the Mission Viejo Co. has donated $636,517 to various political causes 
during the same period, according to county records filed by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Every member of the Board of Supervisors has received modest campaign 
contributions -- ranging from $250 to $1,000 -- from the Mission Viejo Co., and 
the company is also the largest single gift-giver to supervisorial staffs. It 
gave away more than $2,000 in meals, tickets and other gifts to the 
supervisors' aides last year. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions go to state and local officials at all levels -- from 
South County school board representatives to a Los Angeles County supervisor to 
the lieutenant governor's campaign of state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the donations go to candidates who are in a position to make 
transportation or cityhood decisions that could affect development of south 
Orange County, and in a few instances, the donations come at timely moments. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven months after she received $5,000 from the company for her state Assembly 
campaign, for example, Local Agency Formation Commission member Evelyn R. Hart 
voted against an annexation proposal that the Mission Viejo Co. strongly 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
And three months after she cast that vote, the company added another $1,000 to 
her Assembly campaign coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel said the contributions were unrelated to Hart's position with LAFCO. 
Hart said she believes the company contributed heavily to her campaign because 
of its longstanding displeasure with incumbent Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while the company rewards politicians it likes, its more significant 
financial efforts have been directed at punishing officials it opposes. 
</P>
<P>
The company spent $282,042 in an unsuccessful attempt to recall Mission Viejo 
Councilman Robert A. Curtis earlier this year, a staggering sum that raised 
eyebrows across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who retained his seat and has since met with company officials to 
discuss their development plans for the community, said the company's 
willingness to strike out at its opponents is what distinguishes it from other 
county political donors. 
</P>
<P>
"They spend money to support some candidates," Curtis said, "but they are 
clearly the most aggressive of the large landowners in the county in terms of 
their willingness to frontally assault those with whom they disagree." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with a challenge to its South County development agreements in 1988, 
the company also came out swinging. 
</P>
<P>
When the city of Irvine joined with Laguna Beach and slow-growth proponents to 
challenge a development agreement governing construction of Aliso Viejo, the 
Mission Viejo Co. helped finance a blistering legal response, suing then-Mayor 
Larry Agran and two other council members and tying up the city in intense and 
costly maneuverings. 
</P>
<P>
"They bled the city's resources," Agran said. "They moved in their own Xerox 
machine and had it operating full time while they copied 80,000 pages of city 
documents. . . . They turned City Hall upside down." 
</P>
<P>
Copying and depositions dragged on for months as council members and other city 
officials were questioned again and again. The city's suit against the Mission 
Viejo Co. and the company-financed suit against the city wound up costing 
Irvine $465,000, City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said, making the pair of 
related cases the most expensive ever fought by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's case against the Mission Viejo Co. eventually was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Munsell, a former county planning director who filed the suit against 
the city, said his side's legal fees ran to about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co., he said, paid more than half that bill -- as legal fees 
and not political contributions, the exact figures do not appear on public 
disclosure statements that are filed with the government. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very public about that at the time," Wetzel said. "(Munsell) came to 
us and asked us if we would support his legal effort, and we said we would." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council was also sued, but efforts there went a step 
further. After that council tried to block the Aliso Viejo project, three 
council members -- Dan Kenney, Robert F. Gentry and Lida Lenney -- found 
themselves the subjects of a recall campaign backed by the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
That campaign, sponsored by local businesses irritated that the council would 
not permit certain forms of outdoor advertising, drew $3,600 in contributions 
from the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basis there was private property rights," Wetzel said. "The city of Laguna 
Beach had filed suit against our Aliso Viejo development. There were people who 
opposed that suit and defended property rights, and we supported those people." 
</P>
<P>
But the company's willingness to strike back, either through recalls or in 
court, has subjected it to intense criticism, more so even than the larger and 
more powerful Irvine Co., according to many observers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can spend the money. The difference is if you spend it crassly, people 
will get upset," Mark P. Petracca, a UC Irvine political science professor, 
said of the company's involvement in the Curtis recall campaign. "People do 
have a sense of fundamental fairness, and what the Mission Viejo Co. did was 
essentially unfair." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, even some of the company's supporters say that its political 
adventures probably have been ill-advised and may have damaged its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard people say that (the Mission Viejo Co. is) a little politically 
naive, though I'm not sure I agree with that," said Planning Commissioner 
Meharg. "It may be true, though. That may be why they get bashed a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE POLITICAL PUNCH OF THE MISSION VIEJO CO. 
</P>
<P>
While praised for the quaility of its housing developments, the Mission Viejo 
Co. has been criticized for its contributions and gifts to some politicians, 
and its agressive campaigns against others. The company has donated $636,517 to 
a range of political causes since 1987. "We support candidates who believe in 
free enterprise, good planning and good government," company spokeswoman Wendy 
Wetzel said. "That's our response to all questions dealing with political 
contributions."

O.C. GAS MASK SALES LEAP AMID 'PARANOID REACTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Military surplus stores throughout Orange County are reporting increased sales 
of gas masks to customers apparently frightened by reports of potential 
chemical warfare by Iraqi forces in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
And although store employees warn that the type of mask available at surplus 
outlets does nothing to protect its wearer from the kind of poison gas that 
would be used in combat, it hasn't stopped the demand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a paranoid reaction," said Gil Wiggins, an employee of South Coast Army 
&amp; Navy in Newport Beach. "Some people are just not that intelligent. They 
hear about chemical warfare in Iraq, and they think we're next. It's the same 
thing that happened in the 1950s with the Cold War, when everybody was building 
shelters to protect themselves from the atomic bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins walked over to a shelf, pointing out a box of gas masks selling from $5 
to $10 each. The Israeli-made masks have a rubber strap that hooks around the 
back of the head and contain a carbon filter that goes over the mouth and nose. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to buy these, that's fine," Wiggins said. "But you're not going 
to find our (U.S.) troops wearing them. The only reason we carry these is 
because people who work as sandblasters or house painters can use them as a 
cheap, disposable filter for contaminating fumes." 
</P>
<P>
Military personnel in the Middle East are equipped with a special, hooded mask 
known as the M-17, which is not legally available at surplus stores. The masks 
have a chemical-resistant covering and should be worn with a special combat 
suit, said Jeff Walton, assistant manager of Army-Navy Surplus in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Walton said the demand for gas masks has been so high that he took them off an 
obscure shelf and created a display near the front counter. Pre-Mideast crisis 
sales of two or three masks a week have jumped to an average of three or more a 
day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've sold out twice on them already since about a week ago," Walton said. "I 
sold 10 one day, and a lot of people are buying them for their entire family. 
It's almost a paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
Calls have also come in from Middle Eastern people in the area inquiring about 
ordering large quantities of the special, chemical-proof masks to ship them 
overseas to family and friends, Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Surplus in Westminster, an older version of a chemical-proof gas 
mask known as the M-16 is available at prices ranging from $60 to $100, and 
chemical combat suits sell for about $40 each, employee Marvin Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a sign advertising the suits that said, 'The time is now to buy your 
chemical suit,' but (the management) wouldn't let me put it up because they 
thought it might start a panic," Ferguson said. "It was just meant as a joke, 
but I guess some people think (Iraqi troops) are really coming over here." 
</P>
<P>
Store operators said that enlisted Marines and reserve troops also are stocking 
up on extra clothing and equipment that is reportedly in short supply on area 
military bases. Popular items include canteens, T-shirts, socks, salt tablets, 
hats and desert camouflage clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't sell desert camouflage at all up until a week ago," said Michael 
Sherman, who owns surplus stores in Newport Beach and Santa Ana. "Now I can't 
keep it in stock."

ARSON SUSPECTED IN BOWLING ALLEY BLAZE

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected arson fire, the second one in two weeks at Maple Lanes bowling 
alley, destroyed the structure early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. Cameron Phillips said the blaze, which was reported about 2:30 a.m., 
raged through the interior of Maple Lanes at 10192 Garden Grove Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
It took 40 firefighters almost one hour to bring the blaze under control. The 
loss was put at about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is under investigation. But police said the incident 
appears to be the second arson fire at the bowling alley this month. The first 
blaze started in almost the same place behind the building, police said.

<P>
Jim Wade came to the second annual Vietnam veterans reunion in La Habra on 
Saturday to look for a fellow soldier. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know his name, but I'll never forget his face," said Wade, 44, of Long 
Beach, who remembers unloading the wounded soldier from a helicopter that had 
been hit. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a corpsman. He had lost half his leg. From the top of his right 
(buttocks) cheek right down to his heel, it was missing," Wade recalled. "He 
had been given a shot of morphine. I could tell because the 'm' was written on 
his forehead in blood. I know he'll never forget me because he looked at me and 
said, 'Am I going to keep it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Wade didn't find the man, but he found camaraderie among more than 2,000 other 
veterans who gathered at El Centro Park with friends, families and other 
supporters to listen to poems, prayers, speeches and music. They ate hot dogs, 
browsed through booths selling T-shirts, pins, patches and books, threw darts 
at a photocopied picture of "Hanoi Jane" and offered each other hugs and pats 
on the back. 
</P>
<P>
To the strains of "Behind Bamboo Tears" and "Good Night, Saigon," they laid 
hundreds of carnations in front of a bamboo cage containing an MIA/POW flag, 
silently saluting their missing comrades. Ceremonies also honored those killed 
in the war and those who made it home alive. A special ceremony honored Tommy 
De La Rosa, a Vietnam veteran and Fullerton undercover narcotics officer killed 
earlier this year in a drug bust gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion was organized by Brothers of Vietnam, a self-help support group for 
Vietnam veterans. The La Habra-based group has more than 300 members from 
around the country in all branches of the armed forces. Its motto is "Lest We 
Forget," and the reunion puts it into practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We told stories the other night, and it was surprising the things we could 
remember," said Bruce Sartwell, 42, who flew from New Hampshire for the reunion 
and a chance to see two other members of his five-man Army Ranger team for the 
first time in more than 20 years. "As bad as some of the situations were over 
there, I think it's important not to forget. . . . A philosopher once said that 
people who forget history are doomed to repeat it." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the memories were good -- beautiful countryside, sunsets, a different 
culture and partying with fellow soldiers. But more were painful. 
</P>
<P>
Chet Ronzello, 42, of Placentia recalled that when he was sent to Vietnam in 
the 1st Marine Division, he tried to find his longtime best friend, Tony 
Spirito, who had gone over a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Having no luck, he eventually asked his commanding officer to help and was sent 
to a building near an airstrip in Da Nang. When he entered and asked for his 
friend, a sergeant directed him down the hall and through the double doors. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through the double doors and asked the corporal where to find Tony, and 
then I realized where I was. I was in the morgue. He went over and opened a 
door and there were all these plastic bags stacked there. He walked over and 
there were tags and he found one and he asked 'Is this your buddy?' That was 
hard," he said, his eyes filling with tears as he remembered. 
</P>
<P>
The first time he killed someone in combat, he thought of the man's family, and 
it was painful, Ronzello said. "Two days later, it happened over again and when 
it keeps on happening, you start to build up a lot of walls. When I found Tony, 
all hell broke loose and all I could do was hate. I volunteered for every 
patrol there was after that, and all I wanted to do was hurt people." 
</P>
<P>
When he got home, it wasn't much easier, facing the rampant anti-war sentiment. 
Back at El Toro, when the men were finally allowed to leave the base, they were 
told not to wear their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us, 'You've seen nothing, you've heard nothing, you've done 
nothing.' Finally you figure it out. You're supposed to hide." 
</P>
<P>
And when he finally made it back to Connecticut, his mother whispered in his 
ear that she was sorry there was no poster saying "Welcome home, son," but the 
airport officials advised her against it. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came home, a lot of bad stuff happened," said Larry Hughes, commander 
of Brothers of Vietnam. "We were treated really bad. No one wanted to talk to 
us. No one wanted to associate with us. . . . That's why I started this club. I 
belong to other clubs, and they didn't want to recognize Vietnam veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Most veterans there said they suppressed memories of the war for 20 years. Now 
they are beginning to feel like they're being welcomed home. 
</P>
<P>
"Never again am I going to let someone put down my brothers for what we did in 
Vietnam. That won't happen again," Hughes said.

RESIDENTS PROTEST DEVELOPER'S SALES TACTICS AS DISHONEST, PRESSURING

<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 residents of a Tustin Ranch development picketed at the project's 
sales office and on nearby corners Saturday to protest what they say are 
dishonest and high-pressure tactics used by the developer's sales 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
According to the group, which calls itself Block Real Estate Nonsense, sales 
representatives told prospective home buyers that they should buy immediately 
because prices in subsequent phases would go up and special deals on carpeting, 
tile and drapes would soon be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents said that, in trying to buy immediately, they lost money on 
other deals and made other sacrifices. Most of the residents bought their homes 
during late 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, home prices have gone down and incentives on extras have gone up. 
</P>
<P>
Cary Bren, president of Baycrest Development Co. and son of Irvine Co. Chairman 
Donald L. Bren, said in a statement that it has never been the company's policy 
to guarantee future prices or other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the majority of new residential projects in central and south Orange 
County, we are currently offering an incentive package to new home buyers which 
has gradually increased over the recent months, and it has been our intent to 
remain competitive," he said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Nellie Hennington, a sales agent at Maricopa, said that agents there know not 
to make such statements because the market could change. At the bottom of the 
price list -- which ranges from $329,990 to $378,990 -- is a statement that 
prices are subject to change without notice, she pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that real estate goes up and down and we're in one of the down 
cycles," said Mike Altman, one of the resident group's leaders. "Our primary 
complaint is that they misled the hell out of us." 
</P>
<P>
As the real estate market has softened, Altman, one of the group's leaders, saw 
the price on the 2,400-square-foot home he bought in April, 1989, drop from 
$386,000 to $358,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picketers gave flyers to prospective buyers telling them that they like the 
community and are protesting only the sales tactics. They said they plan to 
picket on weekends at the Maricopa development and other Bren developments. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope they'll resolve the issue with some kind of rebate," said Dan Jackson, 
one of the picketers.

PROTEST AGAINST COMEDIAN IS LOUD BUT ORDERLY

<TEXT>
<P>
Demonstrators from Orange County gay and feminist groups protesting 
controversial comedian Andrew Dice Clay's performance traded remarks with 
concert-goers Saturday night, but the demonstration was otherwise peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 protesters held signs and shouted slogans outside the Pacific 
Amphitheatre to decry what they called Clay's hostile humor against gays, women 
and minorities. The loud but orderly protest was staged by members of the 
county chapter of ACT UP (AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power) and the South Coast 
and Bayside chapters of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was the first one ever at the concert venue. Costa Mesa 
police said they beefed up security with 12 additional officers, but the 
demonstration proved calm, and there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Barton, 30, one of the protest organizers and a member of ACT UP, said the 
issue of Clay's humor goes beyond "gay bashing." 
</P>
<P>
"His act promotes violence against women and minorities," Barton said. "I don't 
believe in censorship, but I believe we have to alert the people to what he is 
saying." 
</P>
<P>
As demonstrators held signs reading "Jokes Kill" and "Words Kill," profane 
insults were hurled at them by passing motorists and people arriving for the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make me feel too good to see the hatred of the people who are going 
to this event," said Georgia Reed of the South Coast chapter of NOW. "But we 
have to make a stand and show everyone that not everybody from Orange County 
supports hate and violence against women." 
</P>
<P>
Clay's style of humor has earned the scorn of gay and women's groups, who 
contend that the comedian denigrates people. Clay, however, has said that he 
has dropped his material about gays and that he sees nothing wrong with his 
current act. 
</P>
<P>
Although the protesters managed to turn a few heads, the majority of the 
concert-goers seemed nonchalant about the demonstration and concerned only 
about getting to their seats for the sold-out performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this whole thing is overblown," said concert-goer Richard Pirics, 35, 
of Huntington Beach, who has seen Clay once before. "He's just a comic. And I 
really don't know what these people have against him." 
</P>
<P>
Ritchie Black, 32, of Torrance was seeing Clay for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems these people are far too sensitive," Black said. "I know lots of 
Catholics who roar at a good Catholic joke. It's just comedy."

12 INDICTED IN COCAINE SHIPPING SCHEME 
</P>

<P>
Twelve suspected drug runners, including two from Orange County, have been 
indicted on charges alleging that they tried to ship more than 1 1/2 tons of 
cocaine across the country in tractor-trailers. 
</P>
<P>
The federal indictment returned Friday culminates almost a year of 
investigation by Anaheim police, which has broken up several cocaine smuggling 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine were Alejandro Sanchez, 41, of 
Yorba Linda and Paul Velez-Torres, 28, of Huntington Beach. The others indicted 
were Cubans and Colombians from Florida, New York, New Jersey, Rialto, 
Temecula, and Covina. 
</P>
<P>
All are scheduled to be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Aug. 
27. The defendants, who were arrested last week, face penalties of 10 years to 
life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that the operation used trucks and trailers with secret 
compartments to ship thousands of kilograms of cocaine from a central warehouse 
in Rancho Cucamonga, which was the hub of a network of smaller storage areas. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. attorney's office, narcotics agents intercepted five 
shipments of cocaine -- 1,527 kilograms, worth an estimated $25 million -- from 
the alleged operation from September to November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, the state 
Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, Fullerton and Brea police and the San 
Bernardino County Sheriff's Department participated in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police, in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, have been 
investigating suspicious trucking operations for almost a year that involve 
Cubans and Colombians from New Jersey, New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, officers arrested seven people and confiscated 5,000 pounds of 
cocaine bound for the East Coast from a trucking operation with storage sites 
in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. Law enforcement authorities 
described it as the second largest seizure of the drug in the state.

EX-TITAN ABBOTT LOSES KICKING JOB TO NELSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Cal State Fullerton kicker Vince Abbott's hopes of returning to the NFL 
were dashed when the San Francisco 49ers signed former Ram Chuck Nelson to 
handle kickoffs in Monday's exhibition game against the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott and Nelson had tryouts last week at the 49ers training camp in Rocklin, 
Calif. The 49ers had been seeking a kicker since Mike Cofer missed last 
Saturday's exhibition against the Raiders because of a pulled left hip muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 30, was the Rams' fourth-round draft choice in 1983. He kicked for the 
Bills in 1984 and the Vikings from 1986-1988. STEVEN HERBERT

TITANS LAND 330-POUND FORMER ARIZONA STATE PLAYER

<P>
Mike Simmons, a 6-foot-7, 330-pound offensive tackle who played the 1987 season 
at Arizona State, has enrolled at Cal State Fullerton and will begin practicing 
with the Titans this week, Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons played high school football in Oklahoma and redshirted his first season 
at Arizona State in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
According to Murphy, Simmons started several games for the Sun Devils in 1987 
but fractured a vertebra in his neck during spring practice in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said Simmons was cleared by his personal physician to continue playing 
but was not permitted to play by an Arizona State physician. He was checked on 
Saturday by a Fullerton physician, who gave Simmons clearance to play. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy doubts that Simmons, who has one season of eligibility remaining, will 
move into a starting role by the Sept. 1 season opener against Sonoma State, 
but Simmons will be the Titans' largest player and is expected to contribute 
eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"He was looking for a place to finish school and where he could give football a 
shot," Murphy said. "Before the season is over, he could really help us. He 
gives us depth at the position and might allow us to redshirt some other 
people." MIKE DiGIOVANNA

BATTLE ON TO SALVAGE FARWEST; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: A LARGE JUNK BOND PORTFOLIO HAS HOBBLED THE HIGH-FLYING BELZBERG 
BROTHERS, AND MOST AGREE THAT ONLY A CASH INFUSION CAN SAVE THEIR S&amp;L. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FarWest Savings had long been a good investment for the Belzberg brothers of 
Canada -- Samuel, Hyman and William. 
</P>
<P>
Acquiring FarWest in 1974 gave the Belzbergs a foothold in the United States. 
Then, using the thrift and and First City Financial Corp. Ltd. in Vancouver, 
Canada, they became among the most feared corporate raiders and takeover 
strategists on the U.S. scene during the 1980s. Often acting as so-called 
greenmailers, their hostile bids made them millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But today, their U.S. flagship is in danger of sinking. On Thursday, federal 
regulators imposed operating restrictions on FarWest, prohibiting the purchase 
and sale of assets and the making of any loans without regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
The action is a blow to the Belzbergs -- and puts greater pressure on them to 
bail out the faltering institution. Without a fresh infusion of capital, 
FarWest is likely to join the government's portfolio of failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrift's survival is largely predicated on what their principal owners 
want to do," said Gerry Findley, a Brea banking and thrift consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Like some other high-flying S&amp;Ls, Newport Beach-based FarWest's problem 
stems not so much from bad loans -- the savings and loan has been profitable on 
an operating basis -- but from huge investments in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest officials say it is being brought down by the federal law designed to 
save the S&amp;L industry -- the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and 
Enforcement Act of 1989. The new law banned junk bonds -- high-yield, high-risk 
debt securities -- from thrift portfolios by July, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift has been staking its revival on a plan that called for trimming 
assets, selling junk bonds and bolstering capital with a new stock offering to 
shareholders of its parent firm, FarWest Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest officials have admitted that a failure to get the plan approved could 
be fatal. "The company's ability to continue as a going concern depends upon 
receiving approval of a plan," the company said in a recent filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But regulators in San Francisco at the Office of Thrift Supervision, which 
oversees thrifts, last week rejected the plan. FarWest has appealed to thrift 
regulators in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Green, chief executive of FarWest, said the regulators, in part, 
objected to how the thrift wants to treat a subsidiary holding junk bonds and 
equity real estate investments. The S&amp;L wants to liquidate the unit and 
fold it into the thrift as a direct holding. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan's rejection is upheld, FarWest would have to write off about $60 
million in capital, rendering it insolvent with a negative net worth of $23.6 
million to $75 million, depending on accounting and tax considerations, the 
thrift says. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculate that another major problem may be an unwillingness by the 
Belzbergs, who control 57% of FarWest Financial, to commit themselves to 
putting more of their own money into the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
"Other investors would want the assurance that the Belzbergs are coming in," 
said Kenneth H. Thomas of Miami, an industry consultant. "If the Belzbergs 
don't come in, investors would wonder why they should step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Neither William Belzberg, chairman of FarWest Financial and FarWest Savings, 
nor Samuel Belzberg, chairman of First City, responded to several requests for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest is among a handful of large thrifts that together acquired billions of 
dollars of junk bonds through Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
Earlier this year, Drexel filed for bankruptcy and Milken pleaded guilty to 
criminal charges stemming from his junk bond activities. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who loaded up on junk bonds make up a rogues gallery of troubled 
thrifts now under regulatory control: Lincoln Savings in Irvine, Imperial 
Savings in San Diego, Gibraltar Savings in Simi Valley, CenTrust Bank in Miami 
and Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan in Denver. Columbia Savings of 
Beverly Hills was the biggest junk bond buyer among thrifts but has not been 
seized. 
</P>
<P>
While some industry analysts and consultants feel that FarWest once stood a 
better chance than its beleaguered brethren of surviving, they now say that 
regulatory restrictions could be a prelude to a federal takeover. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1989, FarWest Savings had $667 million in junk bonds, about 14% of 
its $4.8 billion in assets. The company has written down its junk bond holdings 
since. Its portfolio was valued at $395 million as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L lost $46.1 million last year, $25.8 million in the first quarter of 
1990 and $3.7 million more in the second quarter. Most of the red ink is 
attributed to the writedown of its junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
While solvent, FarWest does not meet the tougher capital standards imposed by 
the new federal thrift law. As of June 30, its $37.7 million in tangible 
capital, one measure of stability under federal law, was $23.6 million short of 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
It also faces several troubling lawsuits. Farwest was hit earlier this year 
with a $24-million judgment by a Denver jury. The civil case, which Farwest has 
appealed, alleges that the thrift reneged on a $5-million loan and ruined the 
plaintiff's business. In another case, four shareholders allege that FarWest 
wasted assets through its junk bond activities. 
</P>
<P>
While it continues to make a profit on operations, the thrift has been hurt by 
loans it made in Colorado, Utah and Texas in the mid-1980s. FarWest stopped 
lending in those states three years ago when the loans soured with the energy 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, FarWest executives say they are confident about the 
thrift's future if they can overcome regulatory hurdles. They say they have 
already taken several steps to turn FarWest around. 
</P>
<P>
* Last year, the holding company contributed $12.5 million of its cash in hand 
to the S&amp;L's capital base. 
</P>
<P>
* To help meet capital standards, FarWest is reducing its assets. Thrift 
officials said that in the second quarter, assets were cut to $3.7 billion, 
partly by selling a mortgage-banking unit to managers who started it six years 
ago. The S&amp;L plans to shrink to as low as $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* FarWest has cut staff and overhead expenses. 
</P>
<P>
* Under a regulatory mandate, the thrift is reducing costs by eliminating 
brokered deposits, the large-denomination funds that seek the highest interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
* Lending has been nearly halted. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the key to FarWest's survival is more capital, the thrift's final 
cushion against losses. But it is unclear whether the Belzbergs are willing to 
risk any more of their own cash. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to whether it is in their interest to preserve this and salvage 
their investment," Findley, the Brea consultant, said. "Or they may be at the 
point of saying, 'Oh well, let that thing go. We've got better things to put 
our money in.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs would not be the first to walk away from a thrift investment. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Huntington Beach developer Frank Mola decided that he wasn't going to 
add to the $12 million he already had put into Charter Savings Bank in Newport 
Beach and allowed regulators to seize it. The law's new standards for 
determining capital had wiped out the solid base that Charter thought it had. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 3, M. Lee Pearce quit as chairman of AmeriFirst Bank in Miami, saying 
that he would not risk any more funds without more cooperation from regulators. 
Pearce, who picked up $65 million in his failed takeover bid of American 
Medical International Inc. in Beverly Hills last fall, had invested $8.5 
million in ailing AmeriFirst 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the Belzbergs read about people like Pearce, and they may say, 
'Sometimes, you run up against a team you just can't beat,' and they may leave 
the industry," Thomas suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs, most observers agree, have a keen eye for what makes economic 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
Sons of a Polish immigrant, the characteristically close-mouthed brothers built 
an empire from their base in Calgary, where their father, Abraham, operated a 
furniture store. Hyman, 63, runs that store, Cristy's Arcade, today. 
</P>
<P>
Sam, now 62 and the only brother with a college degree, led his brothers first 
into real estate and oil and gas leases in Alberta. In 1962, needing financing, 
he started City Savings &amp; Trust Co. in Calgary, the predecessor to First 
City Financial's banking unit, First City Trust Co. It grew to become one of 
the largest financial institutions in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs gained widespread attention in their native land in 1973 when 
they sold their majority interest -- 62% -- in a real estate firm for $48 
million, without requiring the buyers to offer the same terms to minority 
shareholders. The following year, in a friendly transaction, they won 
controlling interest in FarWest Financial. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest Financial owned State Mutual Savings &amp; Loan, a thrift that opened 
in Los Angeles in 1889 and held $450 million in assets in 1974. The Belzbergs 
moved the S&amp;L to Newport Beach and later changed its name to FarWest 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
William Belzberg, 57, moved to Los Angeles in 1976 to oversee the family's 
first major investment in the United States. He also oversees First City 
Properties Inc., a real estate development firm in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The combined assets of FarWest, First City Financial and First City Properties 
-- estimated at about $7 billion in 1980 -- allowed the Belzbergs to raise 
capital for more serious empire building. Their corporate entities often 
provided financing for corporate takeovers or joined in as investor partners. 
</P>
<P>
Over two years, for instance, the Belzbergs used First City to buy 22.6% of 
Bache &amp; Co., a major New York brokerage. But Bache found a white knight in 
1981 and sold out to Prudential Insurance Co. of America. First City booked a 
$48.7-million gain on the sale of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, FarWest backed a Belzberg-led effort to acquire Bekins Co. in 
Glendale. The company, however, abandoned this effort to join Texas oilman T. 
Boone Pickens' investment group in a raid on Gulf Oil Corp. The hostile bid for 
Gulf put the giant oil firm in play and sent its stock soaring. Chevron 
eventually bought Gulf, and FarWest walked away with a profit of $8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs did not stop with Gulf. They took runs at many companies, 
including Blue Bell, H. H. Robertson, U.S. Industries, Masonite and Ashland 
Oil. But they gained a reputation as raiders and greenmailers, mostly looking 
to be paid to go away. 
</P>
<P>
They picked up $14 million from Ashland in 1986 when the Kentucky refiner and 
marketer paid the Belzbergs nearly $6 a share more than it cost them to acquire 
about 9% of the company. Ashland also extracted a promise from the Belzbergs to 
leave it alone for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
So feared were the Belzbergs that in 1986, when they took a small position in 
Southland Corp., the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, the 
controlling Thompson family scrambled to keep the company. The Thompsons took 
Southland private in a $5.3-billion, leveraged buyout. But the huge debt load 
forced Southland into bankruptcy this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Belzbergs have taken control of some companies. Analysts thought the 
brothers had overpaid for Scovill Inc., a Connecticut company that made Yale 
locks and Hamilton Beach household appliances. They soon sold off all but one 
division for $176 million, more than they paid for the entire company in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, FarWest grew steadily, fueled by the profits of attempted 
takeovers, and from traditional thrift operations and junk bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
It built a mortgage banking operation in six years to a $1.5-billion portfolio 
at the end of last year. The S&amp;L moved more aggressively into construction 
lending for single-family homes and apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But it was junk bonds and brokered deposits that gave the S&amp;L its biggest 
boost, helping it grow from $1.1 billion in assets at the end of 1982, when 
deregulation opened the doors to a wide array of new investments, to nearly $5 
billion last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite regulators' concerns about junk bonds, the S&amp;L continues to 
emphasize that it is making money on an operating basis. However, it increased 
reserves for loan and investment losses by $16.9 million in the second quarter. 
And the company noted that its regular annual examination now under way could 
result in additional reserves being set aside. 
</P>
<P>
"They're profitable on a core basis, but it's hard to divorce the effects of 
the junk bonds," said James M. Marks, an analyst at SNL Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the junk bond problem, FarWest is "doing quite well and, given time, 
will sort itself out," said industry consultant David L. Smith, managing 
associate of Kaplan, Smith &amp; Associates in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Smith is concerned, FarWest's losses from junk bond holdings are 
"absolutely a case where Congress is killing an institution" by the passage of 
the industry-restructuring law. The ban on junk bonds, he said, was aimed at 
specific thrift executives disliked by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest's junk bond portfolio has several securities that were in default this 
year, including those of Braniff, Eastern Airlines and Southmark Corp., all of 
which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But the thrift maintains that its junk 
bond portfolio overall, including investments in McCaw Cellular, National 
Intergroup, RJR Nabisco and Pacific Lumber, is performing well and providing 
needed income. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts, however, don't buy the virtues of junk bonds, at least for 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, an expert on junk holdings by thrifts, charges that thrifts simply 
never had any business putting federally insured deposits at such a high risk 
by investing them in junk bonds. From the start, he said, the bonds were 
grossly overpriced by Milken and Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
"With or without (the new federal law), major junk bond defaults were bound to 
occur," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., consultant, believes that five years is long 
enough to get rid of portfolios in an orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important not to shed too many tears for the FarWests of the world," Ely 
said. "They were enticed by the high yields and really thought that those 
issuing junk bonds were giving away a lot of money. I suspect that over time, 
junk bonds won't outperform Treasury bonds."

Why doesn't someone point out to the television directors what a disservice

TELL TV TIMES: HOW DO YOU RATE DAYTIME'S TALK SHOWS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daytime talkshows survive when they generate loyalty among viewers. So we want 
to know which shows strike your fancy, day after day. From Oprah to Geraldo 
(below), Phil to Sally, Joan to Regis, what talk-show hosts do you tune in and 
which ones turn you off -- and why? 
</P>
<P>
Here are the responses to the July 29 question: What films would you like to 
see on television? 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see "Hold Back the Dawn." It was a 3-star picture made in 1941 
starring Olivia de Havilland, Charles Boyer and Paulette Goddard. 
</P>
<P>
It's a love story that was shown often on TV during the late U50s and early 
'60s. It is one of my all-time favorite movies. 
</P>
<P>
I'd also like to see uncut versions of "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment." 
Mary Woldum, Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
Hold Back the Dawn" occasionally is shown in late-late time slots on KTLA 
Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
Older is better. 
</P>
<P>
The films I'd like to see, in order, are: "The Three Faces of Eve" (Joanne 
Woodward); "Imitation of Life" (Claudette Colbert); "Green Dolphin Street" 
(Lana Turner); "Lillian Russell" (Alice Faye); "Devotion" (Olivia de 
Havilland); "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" (Daniel Day Lewis); "In This 
House of Brede" (Diana Rigg), and "The Winter's Tale" (Laurence Harvey). 
</P>
<P>
Dick Vaughn, San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
Mark your calendar. KCAL has scheduled "The Three Faces of Eve" on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Innumerable times, old movies with a World War II theme have been shown with 
William Holden, but the romantic themes seem to be ignored on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Kwan's interpretation of the sad little Hong Kong prostitute who 
fantasized that she came from a different world was very touching in "The World 
of Suzie Wong" with Holden. 
</P>
<P>
I would love to see it again and so would friends and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
Irys Strange, Morro Bay 
</P>
<P>
Here are some movies I can't get on video and would love to see: "Othello" 
(Laurence Olivier); "Interlude" (Oskar Werner); "Three Sisters" (Olivier); "The 
Hunchback of Notre Dame" (Anthony Hopkins), and "The Secret Garden" (Gennie 
James). 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bonfield, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
What films would I like to see on television? Old science-fiction, anything 
made before 1950. I live in Newport Beach and while we have a couple of 
shopping channels, we don't get (Rcan't" get, the cable company assures me) 
American Movie Classics or The Movie Channel, which invariably have the best 
old science-fiction movies. 
</P>
<P>
Last Halloween there were 14 movies I was aching to see and the cable networks 
available to me carried one of them. I was not pleased!

James Garner (pictured with Sally Field) won a much-deserved Academy Award

TAKEOVER IS DOGGED BY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1985 takeover of Pacific Lumber by Maxxam has generated an unusual amount 
of litigation and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
A series of lawsuits has alleged that Maxxam chief Charles E. Hurwitz and the 
logging company's chief executive, Gene G. Elam, cut an unholy deal that failed 
to give shareholders the best price for their stock. 
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits tend to come with the territory in corporate takeovers, and Hurwitz 
has had his share. But so far, these suits have failed. 
</P>
<P>
In one 1986 decision, for instance, U.S. District Court Judge William W. 
Schwarzer held: "It is abundantly clear that (the board members) did not rush 
into Maxxam's embrace. . . . They concluded, in the words of Winston Churchill, 
that facts were better than dreams." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a congressional subcommittee looking at the Pacific Lumber deal issued 
a report contending that Los Angeles investment dealer Boyd L. Jefferies may 
have parked -- that is, secretly held -- Pacific Lumber stock for the benefit 
of Hurwitz. The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Labor were 
asked to investigate, but neither has alleged any improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Securities and Exchange Commission saw Hurwitz in another light: 
as a victim. The SEC brought civil suit against Drexel Burnham Lambert and its 
junk-bond chief Michael Milken on charges that they defrauded Drexel clients, 
illegally hid the ownership of securities and participated in insider trading, 
citing the Pacific Lumber deal among many others. The SEC charged that Drexel, 
as Hurwitz's biggest financier in the takeover, secretly bought Pacific Lumber 
stock, improperly driving up the final cost to Hurwitz -- and therefore 
Drexel's fees. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel and Milken settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
A current round of shareholder suits, in state and federal court, sees the 
Drexel arrangement differently. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to break up the takeover itself, they say that Hurwitz, far from being 
a victim, worked in concert with Drexel and others to gain secret control of 
more than 5% of the company's stock. Had shareholders known this, the suits 
contend, they could have invoked an anti-takeover measure of the company's 
articles of incorporation. The measure makes a merger bid by anyone effectively 
controlling 5% or more of the stock subject to a tough 80% vote of approval by 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Hurwitz, who launched his takeover with less than 5% of the shares, was able to 
win the much-easier approval of 50% of the voting shares. 
</P>
<P>
Trials in these suits are years away at best. MICHAEL PARRISH

CARTOONIST STILL DRAWN TO 'FAMILY CIRCUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first cartoon appeared in 19 newspapers on Feb. 29, 1960. It was a drawing 
of a census taker filling out a form and asking the woman of the house: 
</P>
<P>
"Any children?" 
</P>
<P>
The woman looks puzzled. Two dirty handprints of a child ring the doorknob. 
Assorted toys, a tricycle, volleyball, baseball and bat litter the floor and 
sofa. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades later, cartoonist Bil Keane, 67, continues to chronicle the 
lighter moments of American family life. But today, many more families share 
those moments. "Family Circus" now appears in 1,434 newspapers throughout the 
nation and the world. 
</P>
<P>
For years, "Family Circus" -- the cartoon that appears inside a circle -- has 
been the most widely circulated syndicated comic panel in existence. Every day, 
it is read by more than 100 million people; readership polls consistently rank 
it among the top three comics in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Keane's cartoon characters are household names and remain the same age year in 
and year out: PJ, 18 months; Jeffy, 3; Dolly, 5; Billy, 7; and the ageless 
Mommy and Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't just try to be funny," said Keane. "Many of my cartoons are not a 
belly laugh. I go for nostalgia, the lump in the throat, the tear in the eye, 
the tug in the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Keane was interviewed recently in his studio in the ranch-style desert home 
where he and his wife, Thel, moved when they left Pennsylvania in 1959. Avid 
tennis players and swimmers, they have a pool and tennis court in their 
spacious back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Family life has taken some dramatic swerves in America since Keane began 
drawing "Family Circus." Yet, the cartoonist hasn't altered his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"The pendulum has swung pretty far out. Some may look on my work as being corny 
or old hat and wonder if my observations on the typical family are passe, what 
with the single-parent family and mixed family units," mused Keane as he put 
finishing touches on his latest panel. 
</P>
<P>
But "Family Circus," a single-comic panel drawn inside an unconventional circle 
instead of the usual rectangle, appears to be in tune with America, adding new 
newspapers all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, 48 books of selections from Keane's daily panels and Sunday 
comic strip of "Family Circus" have been published. More than 14 million copies 
of the books have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Keane and his neighbor, Erma Bombeck, collaborated on one of the 
books, "Just Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own." In a forward to another 
of Keane's books, Bombeck wrote: "Mostly I admire and respect Bil's gentleness, 
his warmth, his respect for that battered, floundering, much-maligned 
institution -- the American family." 
</P>
<P>
In his book "Family Circus Treasury," Keane observed: "A reader once wrote she 
would be shattered if she learned that Bil Keane was a bachelor and not the 
father of a brood of small children. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me an opportunity to set the record straight. I would like to state 
I am indeed an eligible bachelor, quite handsome, and I hate kids. I would like 
to state that but my wife is proofreading this copy and I'll never get away 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is I have been happily married to Thel (Carne), my Australian bride, 
since 1948. We have five children whom I love dearly and have exploited 
mercilessly for my cartoons." 
</P>
<P>
Characters in Keane's comic panel are based on members of his family. Keane 
himself is the bespectacled and often befuddled Daddy, Thel is Mommy, and PJ, 
Billy, Jeffy and Dolly are composites of their four sons and one daughter, and 
now, four grandchildren. Other real-life relatives, including Keane's mother, 
Florence, the comic's gray-haired grandmother, also pop up from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we live in the desert, I show the family living in a typical 
mid-U.S., split-level house," said Keane. "Rather than pinpointing any 
particular part of the country as a place where the family lives, I would 
prefer to have readers think we live just down the street from their own home." 
</P>
<P>
Keane was born in Philadelphia and grew up in suburban Crescentville, Pa. He 
graduated from Northeast Catholic High School in 1940. "I did cartoons for four 
high school publications and then and there decided I wanted to spend my life 
at the drawing board," he recalled. He had hoped to go to art school but his 
parents could not afford to send him. 
</P>
<P>
Working as a messenger at the Philadelphia Bulletin after high school, Keane 
"got to sit down at the edge of drawing boards of artists." As a soldier in 
World War II, he sold cartoons to a national magazine and worked as a 
cartoonist for Stars and Stripes. He met Thel in Brisbane. 
</P>
<P>
Keane returned to the Philadelphia Bulletin from 1945-59, but continued to 
free-lance cartoons to magazines, producing a local comic strip for the 
Bulletin called "Silly Philly" and a syndicated comic strip, "Channel 
Chuckles," that lampooned television. The latter ran in 200 papers at its peak 
and had lasted 21 years when Keane retired it in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9 1/2, 145-pound cartoonist moved to Paradise Valley 31 years ago 
"because we were sitting in a pollen pocket in Bucks County, Pa., where I was 
bothered by allergies and constantly sneezing. In Arizona, I seldom sneeze." 
</P>
<P>
There have been three TV specials based on Keane's comic characters. And, for 
the past three years, the cartoonist has been producing twice-monthly 
inspirational posters that hang in more than 4,000 elementary schools across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Thel and Bil's daughter, Gayle, 40, runs a Sacramento floral shop called 
Bloomingayle's. Son Neil, 38, is a computer design engineer in Los Angeles; 
Glen, 35, is a animator for Disney Studios; Chris, 33, is a feature writer for 
the Santa Cruz Sentinel; and Jeff, 32, lives in Laguna Nigel and helps his 
father with the panel and Sunday comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff pencils some of the drawings, roughs the art, finishes it. If I retire, 
get too ill to do it or die, Jeff will continue the feature," said Keane, who, 
at 67, entertains no thought of retiring. "Why should I quit when I enjoy what 
I'm doing? I plan to continue to draw as long as they're able to prop me up at 
a drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
Keane keeps a drawer in his desk filled with hundreds of ideas for future 
panels written on 3-by-5 cards. "Any time I get an idea, I jot it down. Often, 
I wake up in the middle of the night with a brainstorm and write that down. Not 
one of the more than 10,950 panels I have done in the last 30 years are alike. 
I have enough material here to keep Jeff going for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, who handles the business side of the Keane comic, is the model for 
the comic strip's Mommy as well as his tennis partner. "Thel looks at 
everything before I send it to the syndicate. Thel is the inspiration for a lot 
of things, a lot of the philosophy behind 'Family Circus' comes from her," said 
Keane. 
</P>
<P>
Keane considers life as a successful comic cartoonist "a dream job . . . King 
Features Syndicate splits the revenue 50-50 with me. Some papers pay as little 
as $5 a week, others in excess of $200 a week for the comic, depending on 
circulation," he explained. "I'm my own boss, make my own hours. (But) I put in 
long hours every day. It's a tedious and exacting craft. 
</P>
<P>
"Cartoonists are like film producers. I am in full control of all my 
characters. I decide who I want to say the lines. I'm the script writer. I do 
the costumes. I direct the scenes. I edit it. The whole thing is produced by 
me. I try to keep it as contemporary looking as possible, as up-to-date as 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that I have made my career so many years doing what a lot of 
people would like to do as a hobby, drawing cartoons and getting paid well to 
do it."

BOUTON STILL HAVING A BALL

LITTLE FERRY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Bouton, perennial pariah of Major League Baseball, arrives at semipro 
Bassanio Field wearing a bemused grin above his orange tank top, baseball 
pants, socks and spikes. In his right hand is a plastic box containing a newly 
passed kidney stone -- his career 20th. His teammates on the Little Ferry 
Giants crowd around him to mock and gawk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a macho thing to them," says Bouton, 51, who will pitch tonight. "They 
think I'm real tough." 
</P>
<P>
In the cinder-block dugout, Bouton files his fingernails to get a better grip 
when he tosses his trademark knuckle ball, a hard-to-control pitch that 
flutters, dives and wiggles its way to home plate. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, sports literature devotees, this is the former New York Yankee and Seattle 
Pilot, who gave the baseball establishment the heebie-jeebies 20 years ago with 
his book, "Ball Four," a diary that dared to say players drank, took pep pills 
and philandered. 
</P>
<P>
Newly reissued in a 20th anniversary edition, "Ball Four" is about as old as 
Bouton's semipro teammates, most of whom haven't even read it. "It's an 
American classic that we're introducing to a new generation," Macmillan senior 
editor Rick Wolff, says of the book, which sold almost five million copies in 
hardcover and paperback. 
</P>
<P>
Bouton, blond hair flecked with gray and leaner than in his major-league 
playing days, pitches in the New Jersey Metropolitan League for fun and no 
money, enjoying the pitcher-batter confrontation and the camaraderie of 
teammates 25 to 30 years his junior. Several say they hope to play as well when 
they approach the state of Bouton's codgerhood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the closest I've ever been to being one of the boys, even though I'm 
older than all of them and we go our separate ways when we leave the field," 
says Bouton, a lifelong outsider who rarely felt he fit in with his childhood 
friends and Major League Baseball teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Ball Four" -- for which he scribbled notes by day and tape recorded by night 
-- forever stamped him an outcast and secured his two-sided reputation. To some 
he was an irreverent pitcher-turned-rabble-rousing author. But to baseball's 
reigning powers, Bouton's sharp-eyed diary of his 1969 season with the Houston 
Astros and a short-lived and dreadful expansion team called the Seattle Pilots 
-- established him as a flake-turned-traitor. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought I was writing a regular sports book," says Bouton. "They 
didn't realize I was writing about things like an argument between catcher 
Merritt Ranew and pitcher Fred Talbot in the bullpen about which part of the 
South was dumber." The memory still tickles Bouton into compulsive laughter. 
"Nobody had better material to write than I did." 
</P>
<P>
The scandalous bits -- about night forays to hotel roofs to spy on women as 
they undressed, Mickey Mantle hitting a home run while hung over, and absurdist 
contract talks with miserly team officials over tiny sums -- seem tame now and 
are only small parts of the book. But in 1970, they gave the conservative 
baseball establishment severe agita. 
</P>
<P>
After the first excerpt from "Ball Four" appeared in Look magazine in June, 
1970, then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn reprimanded Bouton, demanded that he 
renounce his book and asked him to sign a pledge that he would never write 
about baseball as long as he remained a player. Bouton refused. 
</P>
<P>
"What a dweeb," Bouton says, recounting the meeting with Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
Former Yankee pitcher Whitey Ford, Bouton's teammate for six seasons, angers at 
the mention of "Ball Four," which said Ford made baseballs dance eccentrically 
by nicking them with his wedding ring or having his catcher rub them with mud. 
The catcher, Elston Howard, later said angrily that he performed the same 
service for Bouton. 
</P>
<P>
"Is 'Ball Four' what you want to talk about?" Ford asks. "Well, I didn't read 
the book. I don't like the man who wrote it. That's all I have to say." 
</P>
<P>
The years after "Ball Four" saw an explosion of tell-all star memoirs, many of 
them revealing far more about players' off-the-field exploits than anything 
Bouton revealed. But none of the descendants, including best-selling 
eyebrow-raisers like ex-Yankee Sparky Lyle's "The Bronx Zoo," quarterback Jim 
McMahon's "McMahon!" and former Seattle Seahawk linebacker Brian Bosworth's 
"The Boz" -- have had "Ball Four's" bemused vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
David Halberstam, an early fan of "Ball Four" and the author of the 
best-selling baseball book "The Summer of '49," says it was a "breakthrough in 
iconoclasm. Here was an unconventional guy who had the chutzpah to point out 
that the gods had the gall to do ungodlike things." 
</P>
<P>
Bouton left baseball soon after the book's publication. The Astros had sent him 
to their minor league team in Oklahoma City, effectively ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, Bouton left the minors and became a broadcaster in New York City 
with the local ABC and CBS affiliates, but the pariah found his true niche in 
oddball baseball-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Big League Chew, strips of gum packaged like chewing tobacco, has been his 
biggest hit. It was devised by Rob Nelson, his free-spirited teammate on the 
minor-league Portland, Ore., Mavericks in 1978, when Bouton launched a comeback 
that landed him briefly on the Atlanta Braves. Bouton and Nelson licensed Big 
League Chew to William Wrigley Co. in a deal that nets the two an annual 
six-figure royalty income. 
</P>
<P>
Bouton extended Big League into ice cream in April when Good Humor created Big 
League Ice Cream -- a chocolate-covered vanilla pop on sticks shaped like 
baseball bats with 26 different players' autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Bouton also gives motivational talks, urging businessmen to enjoy their jobs. 
"Forget the money, the bottom line, the sales figures," he preaches. "When you 
concentrate on the fun, you reach the goals more often." 
</P>
<P>
But this is not a night of rapturous fun on the mound for Bouton. Another 
kidney stone is apparently coursing through his system, and muscle spasms are 
making his knuckle ball do things even a knuckler shouldn't do. Manager Joe 
Stauffer Jr. yanks him in the fifth inning. "Sorry, Joe, I just didn't have it 
tonight," Bouton says. 
</P>
<P>
Most nights he still does have it, almost as much of it as he had in two glory 
years as a Yankee. Despite a total of 39 wins in 1963 and 1964 and two World 
Series victories, he has never been invited to the annual Old Timers Day 
celebrations at Yankee Stadium, or, for that matter, any official baseball 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bouton's attempt to gain favor with Kuhn's successor, Peter Ueberroth, 
went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ueberroth became commissioner," he says, "I sent him an autographed copy 
of 'Ball Four' with a note saying, 'Here's a book the previous commissioner 
didn't enjoy, but you might get a kick out of it.' He never sent me a thank-you 
note. No secretary called. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried." the outsider laughs. "I really tried."

LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS: FROM YOUNG GUN TO YOUNG WRITER 
</P>

At the side of a tenement building near MacArthur Park that serves as a key 
location for Lou Diamond Phillips' new film, "Mind Game," is a billboard 
promoting the just-released "Young Guns II," in which he stars with Emilio 
Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland and Christian Slater. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year Phillips has appeared in the supernatural horror film "The 
First Power" and the political thriller "Show of Force." Since his film career 
was launched three years ago with "La Bamba," in which he played the late 
rocker Ritchie Valens, Phillips has made 10 films. 
</P>
<P>
Too much exposure? Too many roles? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had any regrets yet," says the 28-year-old actor, during a break on 
the "Mind Game" set recently. "A lot of films have come along that appealed to 
me for a variety of reasons. Yet I still turn down many more than I accept." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, one reason for the flood of offers is the actor's "crossover" status: 
in the eyes of Hollywood dealmakers, Phillips is one of the few ethnic actors 
who can carry a film. And his ethnicity is sufficiently vague -- Scots-Irish 
and Cherokee Indian on his father's side and Filipino with strains of Chinese 
and Spanish on his mother's -- that Phillips jokes, "I can play what's in me 
the rest of my life and never do the same role twice." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he's made a good stab at exactly that, playing Mexican-American in "La 
Bamba" and "Stand and Deliver," Lakota Sioux in "Renegades," Navaho-Mexican in 
"Young Guns I and II," Irish in "The First Power," Puerto Rican in "Show of 
Force," plus non-ethnic roles in the feature film "Disorganized Crime" and the 
made-for-TV movie "The Three Kings." 
</P>
<P>
In "Mind Game," a psychological thriller that Phillips wrote, he deliberately 
created his character as a Filipino. "I figured this was probably my only 
chance to play what is a large portion of my (ethnic) makeup." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips plays a struggling novelist discouraged by numerous publishers' 
rejections. Looking for an instant best-seller, he strikes up a friendship with 
a mass murderer (Clancy Brown) newly released from prison. As their 
relationship evolves into something darker, the film hopes to raise questions 
about ambition and what people will do to gain success. 
</P>
<P>
These questions were certainly on Phillips' mind the night four years ago when 
he conceived the story. This occurred, he says, while waiting for a traffic 
light to change at an intersection in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
" 'La Bamba' had been finished but it wasn't going to come out for a year," he 
says. "I made little on 'La Bamba' and was worried about money running out. 
Casting agents liked me but I had no jobs. They wanted to wait and see how 'La 
Bamba' did. At the same time people were whispering in my ear, 'This movie is 
going to do it. "La Bamba" is your big break.' 
</P>
<P>
"So waiting at that light, I started thinking about what I was going to do when 
this movie finally did open on a Friday night and the next day I'm a known 
entity. How is this kid from Texas going to deal with that? Those themes went 
into the character of this writer, who wanted success and was willing to 
compromise to achieve it." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips says he had been writing plays and film scripts long before he came to 
Los Angeles. He makes a point to explain that not all his scripts have roles 
for himself and none of them are typical mainstream Hollywood films. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up in the Texas independent film industry, where you don't write in car 
chases because you can't afford them." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was always committed to a career as an actor, Phillips says he 
wrote and produced plays throughout his high school and college days in Texas 
and after his graduation from the University of Texas at Arlington's drama 
department, he spent three years in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area writing and 
performing with a comedy troupe called "The Zero Hour." 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty much an uncensored 'Saturday Night Live.' We did some rude 
things, not all of which went over. We started in a punk club in 1980 -- an 
hour show at midnight -- then later made the rounds at other night clubs. This 
was my introduction into professional theater." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips began studying film technique with the man he describes as his mentor, 
Adam Roarke, an actor who has appeared in such films as "The Stunt Man" and 
"Play It as It Lays." Soon, Philips worked as an assistant director and 
instructor at Roarke's Film Actor's Lab. During this period, Phillips received 
his first screenwriting credit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on an independent film I'm not going to name because it's in video 
stores. A group had made a film in Texas that they hadn't been able to sell for 
two year. So they came to Adam and me. We had a reputation in Dallas as people 
who knew film -- and we were cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at this film and Adam asked if I could fix it. I spent a month 
studying the film, the script and outtakes. I rewrote 40 pages of dialogue and 
rerouted the plot. Then we reshot for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it a good film? No. But I'm proud that (the new footage) doesn't look like 
it was tacked on two years later. The plot works better and it was a wonderful 
lesson in screenplay structure for me. Also I achieved what I set out to do as 
a writer: We made a cohesive movie that the producers sold and got their money 
back." 
</P>
<P>
"La Bamba," of course, did make the kid from Texas a known entity. 
Writer-director Luis Valdez used the life story of the Chicano rock star to 
create one of the few positive images of Latinos in American films. Valdez and 
Phillips portrayed Valens as the boy next door who achieved success through 
spunk and ambition. Some critics found the film overly sentimental. But 
audiences responded and the film became a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, resulted in the flood of movie offers. "I pretty much 
approach acting as I do my writing." says Phillips. "I try not to do the same 
thing twice." 
</P>
<P>
Re-creating the role of Chavez Y Chavez for the "Young Guns" sequel was, in 
Phillips' mind, less of a repeat than a chance "to fix things I didn't like 
about the first film." In these two Brat Pack Westerns, Phillips found himself 
in the company of other young actors who face the pressures of early success. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in that fish bowl at a fairly early age carries certain baggage, either 
in the press's or the public's eye. I mean, whoever deserves to be as lucky as 
this? You can become extremely bitter about trying to prove something to 
somebody. So you do the best work you're capable of and hope that it speaks for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about choices and tenure. I don't think any of us have tenure yet. 
Certain guys establish themselves at the box office or establish themselves as 
artists beyond what the box office dictates. None of us are at that point. 
We're all working like maniacs but, personally speaking, I don't feel like I'm 
there yet. And maybe I never will be." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the sequel's enticements was a chance to recreate a role that 
Phillips says he likes more and more. "A lot of that has to do with my 
involvement with the Native American community. I'm Cherokee by blood but I've 
just been adopted by the Sioux tribe. On Labor Day, I'm going to the Pine Ridge 
Reservation in South Dakota for my naming ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
Philips, whose Sioux name is Star Keeper, is also organizing a benefit concert 
in Santa Fe this October, called "The Winds of Life," which he plans to emcee. 
The concert will benefit Native American causes. 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason for the Texas native's involvement in "Young Guns" was the 
simple fact that they were Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the most fun I will ever have on a film set," he says. "I was 
thrilled to death to be in a Western." 
</P>
<P>
During the shooting of a lynching scene for "Young Guns II," Phillips got more 
thrill than he bargained for. The scene called for Phillips' character to be 
saved from a lynching when Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) shot the rope in half 
just as he was about to be hanged. But when Estevez fired his gun, the horse 
beneath Phillips -- whose hands were bound behind him -- bolted. 
</P>
<P>
The rope around Phillips' neck snapped before it could do any damage, but the 
actor's foot got caught in the stirrups of the saddle and as he was being 
dragged alongside the spooked horse, his right forearm was shattered in four 
places. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips holds the arm out at a right angle to his body. "It's not entirely 
straight," he says. "In softball the other day I hit one over the fence. But I 
can't throw yet. One nice thing about 'Mind Game' -- I don't have to break a 
sweat, I'm not beat up and I do no stunts. I'm playing a writer." 
</P>
<P>
"Mind Game" producer Richard E. Johnson admits that normally he would have 
"great trepidation" about producing a film whose star also functioned as the 
writer. "You might wind up with a vanity piece. But Lou is extremely 
level-headed and professional. He can really separate the functions. On the 
set, he responds like an actor, not a writer." 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most complex character he has done on screen," adds 
director Scott D. Goldstein. "Lou's using aspects of characters he's played 
before in films and molding them together into a new form." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips himself notes: "Usually, you do research to assume somebody else's 
personality. But I created this guy for me. I know what my motivations are." 
</P>
<P>
A smile crosses his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before this film began, I received a batch of rejection letters for a 
novel I've written. We got clearances to use the (publishers') letterheads for 
a scene where the character throws his rejection letters into a fire. Just 
before filming, I read over one letter and said, 'Guys, there's no question 
about my motivation for this scene. I know what it's about.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once "Mind Game" wraps, Phillips gets even busier. First on his schedule is 
"The Dark Wind" for executive producer Robert Redford and director Errol 
Morris. Phillips is negotiating to play mystery writer Tony Hillerman's 
American Indian detective, Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police. He then 
heads to Canada for "Agaguk," a film directed by Jacques Dorfman, which finds 
Phillips cast as -- yes, an Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got the script, I had to laugh. For years I've been saying, 'Hey, maybe 
one day I'll play an Eskimo.' Then here it is. But then I stopped and thought, 
Well, gee, who else are they going to send this to?"

AFTER A ROCKY YEAR, CHRISTIAN SLATER REGAINS HIS FOOTING WITH THE NEW TEEN 
ANGST TALE, "PUMP UP THE VOLUME" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"I'm going do-o-o-o-o-wn in a blaze of glory!" Christian Slater was wobbly 
crooning at the top of his lungs, "Take me n-o-o-o-o-w, but know the truth. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a Westwood cappuccino cafe, sipping black coffee and chain-smoking 
Marlboros, the likable young actor couldn't resist singing along to the Jon Bon 
Jovi hit from "Young Guns II," which was blaring over the cafe sound system. 
After all, Slater is one of the stars of the current brat-pack Western. 
</P>
<P>
But what really has Slater revved up is his other new film, "Pump Up the 
Volume," a bold celebration of adolescent Angst which casts Slater as the 
fiendish wizard behind a rabble-rousing pirate radio station. Following in the 
footsteps of such teen-anarchy classics as "Rebel Without a Cause," "Over the 
Edge" and last year's "Heathers," (which also starred Slater) "Pump" is one of 
those rare Hollywood films which captures kids' wildly jumbled emotions without 
dismissing them as sex-crazed maniacs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I loved about the script -- the writing was so real," says Slater, 
an affable 20-year-old with a handsome, open face and a self-deprecating sense 
of humor. "It was a fascinating character to play, because I was really acting 
like Superman. I was meek and mild on the outside, but a hero on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder Slater had a soft spot for a heroic role. In real life, he's 
been singing the blues so much he'd easily swap all his rock-star dreams for a 
session with Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
"I really love his song, 'That's Life,' " says Slater, firing up a fresh 
cigarette. "If I had a theme song, that would be it. It's perfect -- at least 
it's the perfect song for me." 
</P>
<P>
Remember the lyrics? The guy who's sky-high in April, shot down in May? Each 
time he finds himself flat on his face, he picks himself up and gets back in 
the race? 
</P>
<P>
If you want to talk about falling flat, just ask Christian Slater. By the time 
he turned 20, he had won praise acting opposite Sean Connery in "The Name of 
the Rose," Jeff Bridges in "Tucker" and Winona Ryder in "Heathers." 
</P>
<P>
But away from the set, his life was spiraling out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Last December he was arrested after leading sheriff's deputies on a wee-hours 
chase that ended with Slater's car crashing into two telephone poles. Slater 
was sentenced to 10 days in jail and placed on five years probation after 
pleading no contest to his second drunken driving charge in two years. 
</P>
<P>
People who worked with Slater doing publicity for "Heathers" say he was 
constantly chaperoned because "we never knew what he would do next." Allan 
Moyle, who directed Slater in "Pump Up the Volume," added: "Christian drank a 
lot every night, but hey -- he was 19 years old. He never drank on the set -- 
he was not a problem for us at all." 
</P>
<P>
Still, by the time he landed in jail on his second drunken driving offense, 
Slater knew he was in trouble. "It was a horrible experience," he says quietly, 
staring at his coffee. "You look at yourself and say, 'Why am I being so 
self-destructive?' My values had really gotten a little messed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was cruel to my friends. I did all sorts of unproductive things. Who knows 
-- I could've gone down that road even further, to real self-destruction. I 
could've wound up dead." 
</P>
<P>
Slater says he sought treatment for alcohol abuse and now wryly announces: "I'm 
retired from drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked at the people I'd hurt or neglected and all that stuff piles up 
until you finally say, 'Whoa!' Drinking is a disease. It's a degrading way of 
life -- and it took me to hit emotional bottom to overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
Slater knows he has a rocky road ahead. But he's relishing the praise he's 
receiving for "Pump Up the Volume," a daring film about a shy teen outsider who 
uses a pirate radio station to inspire his schoolmates and overwhelm an 
oppressive high-school principal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been nice to hear good things about the movie," he said, regaining his 
good cheer. "And it's good to be able to enjoy it. I could have everything in 
the world and it wouldn't mean anything if I wasn't able to be happy. Now that 
I care about myself, I can care a lot for other people too. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say I'm working on my self-esteem and my courage and on how 
to learn from situations." He smiled wanly. "And that can keep you pretty 
</P>
<P>
busy." 
</P>
<P>
Allan Moyle's phone rings constantly and a string of messengers keep knocking 
at his door. Moyle keeps busy these days too. Wandering around his house, he's 
still a little punchy after flying back from Atlanta, where he pulled an 
all-nighter doing script revisions on "Love Crimes," a Sean Young and Patrick 
Bergin film being directed by his old friend, Lizzie Borden. 
</P>
<P>
But the amiable 42-year-old filmmaker is happy to talk about "Pump Up the 
Volume," a movie clearly close to his heart -- and a picture that could revive 
his career. A Canadian writer-director who got his start acting in Off-Broadway 
plays and low-budget films, Moyle arrived in New York just as the cultural 
turbulence of the late-'60s was reaching its peak. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from a very small town in Canada and suddenly being in New York was 
like being in Rio at carnival time," he said, savoring the memory. "It was very 
intense." For a time, Moyle worked in a psychiatric hospital "where I blended 
right in with the general population." After moving back to Canada, he began 
making docudramas and low-budget features, influenced by maverick filmmakers 
like John Cassavetes and Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Moyle got his big shot -- and flopped. He was hired to direct the 
much-ballyhooed "Times Square," a bungled, implausible portrayal of teen 
runaways on the lam in New York, adorned with a noisy, uninspired rock sound 
track. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a rotten time," he acknowledged. "And I just figured I wasn't combative 
enough to be a director." In fact, after he'd finished writing "Pump," Moyle 
needed some persuading to climb back into the director's chair. "I just needed 
to feel comfortable and happily my producers were eager to help. Best of all, 
we reached an agreement -- a pretty radical one -- that if we couldn't find a 
dynamite kid, we wouldn't make the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Because "Pump Up the Volume's" pivotal scenes feature its hero, alone in his 
darkened basement, preaching to the teen faithful on his pirate radio station, 
Moyle knew he needed a genuine actor -- someone blessed with both stamina and 
charisma. "I was really worried about spending nine weeks with some kid I 
couldn't stand," Moyle said. "I won't name names. But pick a lousy teen comedy 
actor and imagine what could've happened." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Christian Slater. "I had lunch with him and he was so witty and sexy and 
mysterious that I knew right away we could stop looking," said Moyle. "He's a 
natural. He's not into all that deep method-acting stuff. He brought a lot of 
humor and freshness to the part." 
</P>
<P>
The character Slater plays is a tongue-tied loner who finds solace -- and 
ultimately finds himself -- in the cloistral world of his pirate radio 
broadcasts. His raffish monologues, which mock authority, offer spiritual 
advice and eloquently ponder the mysteries of sex, were inspired by a pair of 
Moyle's early heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a marriage between two of my favorite outsiders -- Lenny Bruce and 
Holden Caulfield," Moyle explained. "I learned more from one Lenny Bruce album 
than any course I ever had at university. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make a movie that had an edge to it. I like all those John Hughes 
movies, but I always thought they were a little too -- well -- pink. They 
could've been tougher. When we were doing 'Pump,' I kept pleading with my 
producer, 'Please, can't we just offend 10 or 15% of the audience?' " 
</P>
<P>
Moyle chuckled impishly: "I have to admit I'd be secretly gratified if some 
people get upset and say, 'I'm not gonna let my kid see that movie!' " 
</P>
<P>
It's refreshing to see that for all his hard-earned maturity, Christian Slater 
can still act like a kid. Roaming around Westwood, he spied the "Young Guns II" 
theater marquee and immediately dragged his visitor in the opposite direction, 
convinced it would be hopelessly square to be seen near the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that afternoon, while being interviewed, his mouth suddenly dropped 
open. "Whoa!" he said, fumbling with a fresh cigarette. It quickly became clear 
what had happened -- he'd spotted a pretty girl walking down the street. 
</P>
<P>
Slater's reputation as a budding ladies man was cemented by no less an 
authority than his mother, who told Rolling Stone last year: "I think girls are 
Christian's major hobby." 
</P>
<P>
If you believe what you read in his publicity files, Slater's been romantically 
involved with Winona Ryder (his co-star in "Heathers"), Kim Walker (a star of 
TV's "The Outsiders") and Samantha Mathis, his co-star in "Pump Up the Volume." 
</P>
<P>
Slater insists his amorous activities have been exaggerated. "I'm a pretty 
faithful guy," he insisted. "If I have a girlfriend, as I do now, I stay away 
from other girls. That doesn't mean I'm not going to observe the beauty around 
me -- I mean, I wouldn't be human. But I'm just not capable of cheating." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps worried that this pronouncement sounded wildly old-fashioned, Slater 
hurriedly added: "Now if I don't have a girlfriend, then things are different. 
Anything goes!" 
</P>
<P>
Despite reports that Slater and Mathis were inseparable during the making of 
"Pump," Slater downplayed talk of romance. "What we really did was go back to 
her trailer and read together. It was new for me, 'cause I've never been much 
of a reader. But it was really fun. We'd sit around and read books like Ann 
Rice's 'Interview With a Vampire' together." 
</P>
<P>
Slater also laughed off reports that visitors to the "Pump" set were instructed 
not to speak to him -- or look him in the eye for fear of ruining his 
concentration. "Nah," he says. "That's a lot of malarkey. I don't go crazy 
doing these parts. I'm not gonna rape some 13-year-old girl 'cause that's what 
my character does in some script. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten to the point where I know it's only a movie, so I try to keep 
things in perspective. I don't beat myself up. In fact, I have the most fun 
when the camera starts rolling, 'cause I just try myself and enjoy doing my 
job. I figure I'm lucky being able to do something that I love." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he admits he was intimidated having to work -- at age 15 -- opposite the 
incomparable Sean Connery in "The Name of the Rose." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, geez, it was the worst," he says, gulping down some coffee. "I love that 
movie, but it was just hell making it. All I remember is that I was freezing, 
feeling incredibly scared and insecure, and standing next to Sean Connery 
thinking, 'How in the world did I get here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Slater wagged his head. "The first night I met Sean I was trying to act so 
relaxed and I immediately knocked this huge glass of red wine right into the 
man's lap." 
</P>
<P>
Slater rolled his eyes. "I think from that moment on my body just went into 
shock for the rest of the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Slater has starred in a few clinkers along the way, like "Gleaming 
the Cube," his sweet disposition has won him a loyal fan club. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a doll," says Denise DiNovi, who produced "Heathers" and now heads 
director Tim Burton's production company. "He doesn't have that arrogance that 
a lot of teen actors get. He's very humble, incredibly professional and very 
sensitive to other people. A lot of actors have charisma or great looks, but 
Christian has an incredible intensity level that separates him from everybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
He even has a sturdy sense of humor. When reminded of how critics poked fun at 
his Jack Nicholson-impression in "Heathers," Slater took the ribbing in stride. 
"You'd think after all the press I got that I would've at least heard from the 
guy," he said with a laugh. "But no-o-o-o-o. Not even a friggin' phone call. 
What's he -- too busy to call?" 
</P>
<P>
If there's one aspect of moviemaking Slater hasn't learned to handle, it's the 
geeky outfits his characters -- especially the kid in "Pump" -- have to wear. 
"Geez, my clothes were just awful," he groaned. "My tank top was so loose it 
was hanging below my nipples half the time. And those bowling shirts -- ughhh! 
Were they ugly!" 
</P>
<P>
So wouldn't you know it that Slater's next film, "Prince of Thieves," casts him 
as Will Scarlett, one of Robin Hood's band of merry men. Slater is excited 
about the part. There's just one tiny deal breaker -- those 12th-Century 
Sherwood Forest duds. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely want to stress that. I am not wearing any tights! Make sure you 
put it in the story so I get the message across. You read it here -- no 
tights!" 
</P>
<P>
Slater flashed a lopsided grin. "No kidding. If you see anyone wearing tights 
in that film, it ain't me!"

PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MILLIONAIRE; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN HE SOLD A $1.75-MILLION SCREENPLAY, SHANE BLACK BECAME A HOLLYWOOD ROLE 
MODEL, WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GREENBERG, James Greenberg is a Los Angeles-based writer who is not 
currently working on a screenplay. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT'S AN ORDINARY NIGHT AT THE Pad O' Guys, the West Los Angeles bungalow where 
screenwriter Shane Black and a dozen or so buddies from his UCLA days hang out 
discussing the weighty topics of the day, such as how long it's been since any 
of them had sex. A picket sign from the Writers Guild strike two years ago 
decorates the wall and a promotional display from the movie "Flipper" and an 
assortment of toys and movie hype collect dust on the mantle. No Good 
Housekeeping seal of approval here. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings. "It's a girl," someone yells in excitement and disbelief. A 
basketball game is on TV but it's just background noise; this is not a 
household of jocks. Neighbors think they're vampires. Amid the commotion, Black 
sits in the corner of the cluttered living room, with a Dominos pepperoni pizza 
on his lap. For dessert, he wolfs down a couple of Haagen-Dazs ice cream bars. 
</P>
<P>
Considering their frat-house lifestyle, it's hard to believe that these people 
are successful screenwriters, actors, production designers and animators. It is 
almost a badge of honor to downplay accomplishments, and anyone displaying the 
least bit of pretension is instantly deflated. Black half seriously thinks of 
himself and his friends as "10 guys in a sinking boat." But to many 
screenwriters of his generation, Black is a role model of how to flourish in an 
industry famous for using and abusing writers. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Black has lived out every screenwriter's dream. In 1986, he 
sold his tough-guy buddy script, "Lethal Weapon," to Warner Bros for $250,000. 
Then last April he upped the ante for spec scripts when he auctioned another 
macho adventure tale, "The Last Boy Scout," to the David Geffen Co. for a 
staggering $1.75 million. He is one of an increasing number of writers reaping 
the benefits of Hollywood's new hunger for completed scripts submitted on 
speculation -- written without a contract from a studio or producer. In a town 
that historically has undervalued screenplays, Black's script was a milestone 
-- for a few months he was the country's highest paid screenwriter. But the 
spending spree quickly escalated and soon his record was surpassed by Joe 
Eszterhas' script for "Basic Instinct," which Carolco Pictures bought for $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that writers deserve at least as big a share as any aspect of the 
creative team," Black says. "The writer is as important as, well, the 
director." With big payoffs for scripts such as "The Last Boy Scout" and 
others, writers are finally asserting the power of the screenplay in the 
movie-making equation, attempting to secure creative control along with the big 
money. 
</P>
<P>
But Black is neither a crusader for writers' rights nor a 
celebrity-in-training. His no-style style -- T-shirt, ripped jeans and 4-day 
stubble -- is a comment on what he considers important. "I don't need the 
beautiful girl on my arm and the fancy car and the best restaurant," he says 
over coffee at Norm's in West Los Angeles, his favorite restaurant. "You could 
make a lifetime out of just trying to maintain your status as a cool guy. What 
I care about is the work." 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't changed much for Black since the big deal. A few nights after 
becoming Hollywood's latest millionaire, he was in a bar with his older brother 
Terry, his longtime mentor and a successful screenwriter himself ("Dead Heat"). 
"After ordering a beer, Shane pulled out his wallet and turns to me and says, 
'Terry, I'm a little low on cash. Could you loan me $10?' I looked at him and 
said, 'Shane, get a job. This writing isn't going to pan out.' He cracked up. 
Shane just doesn't understand what it means to be wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
He still drives a beat-up Mustang convertible and lives in a rented house on 
the Westside with four roommates. "I don't have any immediate plans for the 
money," Black says. "I know this sounds dumb, but every two weeks or so I go on 
a big spree at the Mysterious bookstore on Beverly, and if I see a series of 
books that's going to run me $50, I'm not going to say that's too much. But 
that's really the only difference. And on people's birthdays I buy slightly 
nicer gifts." 
</P>
<P>
If Black isn't particularly interested in his money, a lot of other people are. 
On the same day that accounts of his windfall appeared on the front pages of 
The Times and Variety, he received a call from a Westside real estate agent who 
wanted to help him find a new house. So many people want a piece of Black that 
he has started to become protective of his time and privacy; the message on his 
answering machine apologizes if he's been neglecting you. 
</P>
<P>
One call that he wishes he didn't take came in the middle of the night from a 
female acquaintance, who berated him for his success. "She woke me up at 2 a.m. 
saying she just wanted to let me know that she thought I was sick for writing 
this stuff and making so much money," he remembers. "I should be ashamed of 
myself because there are real writers out there struggling and I write this 
trash." 
</P>
<P>
Like any other successful writer, he's received his share of criticism. Women 
frequently attack his work for being too violent and totally male oriented. "I 
don't hate women," Black says. "If a feminist thinks I'm evil because I dip 
heavily into male icons, then I will have trouble getting along with that 
person. I write about male heroes because I write adventure fiction. So sue 
me." 
</P>
<P>
BLACK'S SOFT, almost weary delivery seems to keep a lid over his emotions -- 
rage, frustration, and even happiness only occasionally dart out from under the 
cover. He tends to be overly critical of his social skills and says he didn't 
go on a date until he was in college. He thinks of writers as the guys who 
stand in the corner at a party gawking at the girls. Looking at his six-foot 
frame and solid build, it is hard to imagine him as the 98-pound weakling he 
claims he was in high school and in some ways still imagines himself to be. 
He's surprised that his shyness is sometimes perceived as arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
For fun, Black is content to shoot pool in his garage, read a good mystery and 
hang out with his friends. The center of his social life is the Pad O' Guys. 
Conversation at the Pad, a cross between an L.A. Algonquin round-table and a 
bull session by a couple white guys hanging around a mini-mall, ranges from 
banter about great-looking babes to semi-serious discussions of favorite 
movies. "We're not totally geeks, but we used to be," he says by way of 
explaining the bond that keeps a core group of 10 or 15 guys and a couple of 
girls together seven years after finishing college. 
</P>
<P>
Any visit to the PAD includes, at no extra cost, a tour of the premises, 
including a stop at the "Shane Shrine," a framed copy of a story from People 
magazine hanging in the place of honor in the dining room. It is unlikely, 
however, that much actual dining goes on there. In the kitchen, a 7-Up coffee 
shop placard features the PAD O' GUYS MENU, offering such items as praise, a 
rare commodity, for 50 cents, or sarcasm, clearly in greater supply, for only a 
cent. To describe their housekeeping skills, the Guys tell a story about how 
after their annual PAD O' PARTY last August they started to smell what they 
thought was a dead rat under the floor. It wasn't until two months later that 
someone opened the oven and discovered the remains of a piece of raw chicken 
left over from the party. 
</P>
<P>
When they first met at college, most of the Guys were just beginning to figure 
out what they wanted to do when they grew up. In those days, Black was a 
theater major. An actor and a stand-up comic, he was known as the Wild Man for 
throwing things around the stage and his general erratic behavior. He wrote a 
string of one-act plays and continued on stage throughout college but scrapped 
acting after he graduated because he was too intimidated by auditions. "It was 
very frightening to think I could just go on not having a career and end up 
living at home," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Home was in Pittsburgh until high school when his father moved his printing 
business to to Fullerton. His father, an ex-college football player, passed his 
affection for hard-boiled heroes on to his son. Shane devoured the Mickey 
Spillane books and the Matt Helm adventures his father left lying around the 
house and then sneaked down to Sun Drugs to spend his lunch money on more pulp 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
He started writing at an early age -- comic strips, short stories, journalism 
-- but never thought of it as a way to make a living until his last year in 
college. His friend Fred Dekker, who was working on a screenplay assignment, 
showed him his sci-fi script and suggested that he try it too. "It just popped 
like a bubble in my head that writing was not impossible and that, in fact, I 
would probably be good at it." 
</P>
<P>
After college, Black worked as a typist for a temp agency, a data entry clerk 
for the 1984 Olympics and, for a short time, an usher in a Westwood movie 
theater. Finally, he made the big move and asked his parents to support him for 
six months while he wrote a screenplay. The result was "The Shadow Company," a 
supernatural thriller set in Vietnam that he describes as a cross between 
"Platoon" and "The Exorcist." With Dekker's help, the script landed him an 
agent and a lot of posh lunch meetings with mid-level studio executives. Black 
enjoyed the attention for a couple of months until he realized that he was 
wasting his time. Instead of buying "The Shadow Company," they wanted to give 
him an assignment. Even then Black knew that that was not for him. "I was 
terrified of being hired. I didn't want to have to work on a deadline. So I 
stopped taking meetings and sat down and wrote a script in about six weeks. And 
that was 'Lethal Weapon.' " 
</P>
<P>
Before starting work on a rewrite on "Lethal Weapon," Black asked the film's 
producer, Joel Silver, if he could have a minor acting role the movie Silver 
was then shooting. He was cast as a soldier in "Predator," an action picture 
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger that was filmed in Puerto Vallarta. For Black, 
it was like a paid vacation, "reading a lot of books, hanging out in the 
jungle, dancing at Mexican discos." Around the same time, he sold another 
screenplay, "The Monster Squad," which he co-wrote with Dekker, who then 
directed it. 
</P>
<P>
"Lethal Weapon" opened in 1986 and there he was, a 24-year-old kid with 
$250,000 in the bank and a hit movie on his hands. Was he happy? Not really. It 
was all a little too much too soon and when Black stopped moving, he lost his 
balance. "By keeping busy from the time I started writing 'Lethal Weapon' until 
basically the movie had come out, I hadn't really faced the fact that I had 
been making all this money and surviving all this pressure," he says. "And 
finally I reached a point where it caught up to me. I guess I didn't really 
deal with success very well for a while. I didn't feel I deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the money and the expectations became a burden. In his car one day, 
Black turned to his friend Jim Birge and suggested that they drive to Las Vegas 
and bet all his profits on red. Whether he was serious or not, Birge talked him 
out of it, but realized that Black was near the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Black wrote the first draft for "Lethal Weapon 2" with novelist Warren Miller 
in which, perhaps reflecting his dark mood, Black killed off Mel Gibson's 
character. Close friends, who had always seen that half-crazed heroic character 
as Black's alter ego, feared that this was a symbolic suicide. Whatever Black's 
motivation, Warner Bros, who was financing the film, had no intention of 
pulling the plug on a money-making series. And when it became clear that it 
wanted a more comedic approach to the material, Black dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
It was a relief; things were beginning to crash in and Black lost his desire to 
write. A family illness threatened to destroy the one constant source of 
stability in his life. Then a longterm relationship fell apart, leaving Shane's 
already shaky confidence at a low point. This is a period the usually 
accommodating Black is reluctant to talk about in detail. For the next two 
years he would do no writing, spending much of his time hanging out at the Pad. 
"I was afraid to do the next project, afraid of failing, afraid of being a 
fluke." 
</P>
<P>
He finally managed to pull himself together, forget about the money and the 
expectations and sit down long enough to tell a story, this time a gritty 
detective tale about gambling and corruption in professional football. When he 
took "The Last Boy Scout" five months later to a local copy shop, he was still 
wondering if he had wasted his time. 
</P>
<P>
BLACK AND A HOST of other writers, some selling their first screenplays, 
discovered that Hollywood, 1989, was the quintessential right place at the 
right time. For the past two decades, the protocol of the screenplay sale 
dictated that a writer go to a studio to pitch an idea; some describe it as 
groveling. If it were well received, he or she would then be paid to execute 
several closely supervised rewrites until the film got made or, more likely, 
the studio grew tired of it. Countless screenplays and years of work regularly 
disappeared down the black hole known as development. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past couple of years, things started to change. Start-up operations 
at the Sony-owned Columbia Pictures and the JVC-financed Largo Entertainment, 
along with acquisition-eager independents such as Morgan Creek, Carolco and 
Island Pictures, created a demand for big budget action scripts, potential 
blockbusters. The easiest way for a new company to get going is to acquire a 
few high-priced, high-profile scripts. Agents, never shy, have taken advantage 
of the demand and whipped it into a frenzy, orchestrating heated bidding wars, 
like military campaigns. Strict time limits, often 24 hours, give the 
proceedings an added air of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
Black's agent, Bill Block, head of the InterTalent Agency, called a handful of 
studio heads and powerful producers and told them that they could pick up a 
copy of Shane Black's new script at his reception desk. It would be sold before 
the end of the day, he assured each one, and it would be sold for more than $1 
million. By the end of the day, it had sold for nearly double that price. 
</P>
<P>
Black scowls at the thought that he encouraged the spec revolution in 
Hollywood. "My attitude is I did this, it's my sale. I may never do it again. 
I'm not concerned that all these writers seem to say I made this big 
difference. Well, I refuse to take responsibility for either brightening or 
dimming the prospects of other writers. I get what I get." 
</P>
<P>
But in the next breath Black will defend a writer's contribution to a movie and 
his right to be paid well for his work. "My feeling is if a movie earns $150 
million for the studio, it is certainly worth paying $2 million to the writer. 
I think the writer's cut is worth 2% of the film's gross box office at least." 
</P>
<P>
No one agrees more than agents who represent the writers. Marty Bauer, partner 
in the Bauer-Benedict Agency, argues that with budgets for films doubling and 
tripling, scripts are simply catching up to the escalating salaries paid to the 
other talent. "Studio executives are screaming. They're motivated by profit. 
But when writers do the same thing, they're appalled." 
</P>
<P>
With Joe Eszterhas' $3 million sale as a benchmark, there is no doubt that the 
spec market is driving up the price of screenplays. But most executives argue 
that chasing spec scripts -- bidding in the morning and buying in the afternoon 
-- is not the ideal way to do business; for one thing, it barely leaves time to 
read the actual script. "It forces you to take an abstract leap of faith based 
on hype," says producer Brian Grazier, whose Imagine Entertainment has been 
active on the spec market during the past year. "It's like being pushed off a 
cliff." 
</P>
<P>
"It's too expensive a game to play," says David Hoberman, president of Disney's 
Touchstone Pictures division. "We tend to shy away from the auction situation." 
</P>
<P>
Disney's formula has been to develop ideas internally and have writers under 
contract execute them. Other studios are now beginning to do the same thing. 
This year, in a return to the traditions of the old studio system of 
filmmaking, Fox Chairman Joe Roth began hiring staff writers with longterm 
contracts. "We will try to get involved with talented and prolific writers who 
in the course of a couple of years can deliver a number of screenplays. That 
way we won't be in such a pressured environment and can actually read material 
and make thoughtful, measured decisions," Roth says. "I have nothing against 
writers getting a lot of money. It's the methodology of buying on spec that's 
bothersome." 
</P>
<P>
A writer signed by Fox, Dale Launer ("Ruthless People"), made his deal about 
nine months ago, before the boom market for spec scripts. He admits that he has 
some regrets and might not have made the same deal today. "It's interesting how 
writers react to Shane's deal. A lot of them react with jealousy and envy 
because they're not getting that kind of money and they feel they're as good. 
Whatever script sold for $1,750,000 will be up for very close inspection and 
there's no way any script can live up to that," Launer says. 
</P>
<P>
As with all things in the film business, the success of "The Last Boy Scout" 
and other spec projects at the box office will determine the fate of spec 
scripts. Whatever the outcome, Launer considers these high-powered deals 
enormously positive steps for writers. "Writers will get more respect because 
this is a town that respects money. Now maybe more movies will be made the way 
they should be, with writers having more control," Launer says. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe now "young writers will be encouraged to go with whatever they have a 
passion for instead of any old idea the studio has, like a car that turns into 
a guy, or whatever," Black says. But ultimately spec writing for him is more a 
matter of personal temperament than Hollywood activism. "It's a gamble. But 
it's a gamble I'm willing to take because if I wrote a script on assignment and 
no one makes the movie, then I'd rather I had never written it. I don't want to 
write a script that no one likes or no one makes." 
</P>
<P>
THERE IS ALMOST no way "The Last Boy Scout" won't be made. After the Geffen Co. 
payed almost $3 million for just the screenplay and the producer, Warner Bros, 
the film's distributor may as well start putting trailers in the theaters now. 
Bruce Willis has been signed to star in the film and Warner Bros President Mark 
Canton is shooting for a January, 1991, start and a Christmas release. For 
Black, the pressure to succeed is intense. "I figure if they're going to pay me 
this much money, then I'd better be the best, I'd better make this great," he 
says with a swagger of confidence and a flash of fear all at once. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the script was sold, Black was in a rewrite meeting getting 
advice from 14 people on how to improve the script he'd obsessed about for five 
months. Currently, he's locked up in his cabin at Bear Mountain hammering out 
yet another draft, trying to maintain the spirit of the original and satisfy 
the not-always-compatible requirements of the studio and the star. He grumbles 
a lot but he's been around long enough to realize that after the first draft, 
you're writing for the studio and that means making changes right and left. 
Black's cooperative but he's no pushover. How does he handle himself in 
meetings? "Quite like he does on the page, but without the guns," Canton says. 
</P>
<P>
Like everything Black has written, "The Last Boy Scout" is basically a modern 
western, but in his morally ambiguous world the characters become more than 
good guys and bad guys. "I really love Chandler and Ross McDonald," Black says. 
"They wrote about personal integrity, morality, conflict, dealing with 
insanity, dealing with pain and death. All those things are extremely important 
to me beyond just writing a thrilling movie." 
</P>
<P>
For "The Last Boy Scout," Black thought that the seamy side of professional 
football would make an ideal milieu for a Chandleresque private eye story. 
"Football is the perfect medium because it combines the spirit of the American 
hero with the spirit of American greed." When a burnt out, hard-as-nails 
detective reluctantly joins forces with a washed up ex-quarterback to expose a 
sports gambling ring that extends to the U.S. Senate, action-packed mayhem 
ensues. 
</P>
<P>
Black gets really annoyed when his movies are labeled action pictures. 
"Commando," where a man just fires a gun for the final thirty minutes, that's 
an action picture, he says. What the character is thinking about as he is 
firing is of more interest to Black. Character, he argues, must be the impetus 
for all action. 
</P>
<P>
According to Black, the film industry has only two categories for movies: 
"serious films and money-makers. It's either about apartheid or starving 
people, or it's Ninja turtles." But to Black, who sees life in terms of heroic 
gestures in a world that can disintegrate at a moment's notice, horror movies 
such as "The Exorcist" or thrillers such as "48 HRS." are more reflective of 
reality than the serious stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But he chokes on the pretentiousness of calling himself a serious writer."I 
would rather be thought of as a storyteller than an author, " he says. "Authors 
write about Russian winters. Storytellers write about guys who have adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, I'll do my revelatory sort of work. Stuff about love, once I've 
found out what it means, stuff about the nature of things. Until then, I'm 
proud to be writing mysteries," he says, fuming. 
</P>
<P>
Black says his script is not a calculated money-maker. "I thought it was too 
rough for most people. It's not a commercial formula; it's a very raunchy, down 
and dirty detective film. I didn't even think it would sell because it was 
weird and out there in terms of sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Weird and out there is where Black likes to live, at least on the page. "He's a 
Mack truck going down a hill with no brakes," says "Lethal Weapon" director 
Richard Donner. Black admits that he's hopelessly attracted to dark subject 
matter. On a visit to the Louvre last summer, a friend says, he spent hours 
gazing at a painting depicting the black plague. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he takes it too far. "A lot of people think he's depressing," says 
friend Jim Birge. "At times he's defeated and has problems with girls. 
Sometimes he's not fun to be around. He's always thinking so much." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Black pours a lot of himself into his characters. "A lot of my heroes 
are very anachronistic in that they're grouchy, gruff, very misanthropic men. 
And maybe that's because I've always felt like something of a misfit myself, if 
you wanted to get psychological. And in the end, all the men who are such 
misfits in my stories always end up validating themselves and being a hero. 
Well, I think that's rather obvious what's going on there." 
</P>
<P>
Friends say Black's mood has lightened considerably in the past year, since 
he's gotten back to work, as if writing was a way of keeping the demons on the 
page and out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, is fortunate enough to find work that is both theraputic 
and enormously lucrative, a fact that doesn't escape Black's notice. 
</P>
<P>
"If you act strange and stand outside of 7-Eleven in a baggy coat, people think 
you're psychotic," Black says. "If you act strange and take those weird 
thoughts and sell them for $1 million, people think you're eccentric. There are 
probably people who think just like me and weren't quite as lucky, and they're 
probably in an institution somewhere. So I'm lucky enough to have a marketable 
obsession, a marketable lunacy as it were."

THE NEXT MUPPETMEISTER?;

<P>
WITH JIM HENSON'S DEATH, HIS CREATIVE EMPIRE WAS THROWN INTO DISARRAY; NOW HIS 
ELDER SON IS TRYING TO LEAD THE COMPANY BACK

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The workshop floor and benches are strewn with turtle masks, body parts and 
green latex suits in various stages of preparation. A furry creature's head 
sits on a desk, its features contorted into a perpetual snarl. In the corner 
two mice, each a foot high, look on unblinkingly, their mouths slightly open in 
expressions of wonder. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Creature Shop, one of two creative engine rooms in the late Jim 
Henson's puppet empire. Today is a Saturday, but a fair number of employees are 
at work -- painting, trimming, fiddling with electronic circuits and bringing 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle puppets to something resembling life. 
</P>
<P>
The mice, Luke and Bruno, are from an earlier exercise in animatronics -- the 
art of making remote controlled puppets move and change expressions. They star 
in a British-made film "The Witches," adapted from Roald Dahl's best-selling 
children's book. Anjelica Huston leads the human faction in the cast. 
Distributed by Warner Bros., it opens across the country on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The brisk work generates a businesslike atmosphere that almost makes one forget 
that this is a company only just recovering from a deep shock. 
</P>
<P>
Henson died suddenly of pneumonia in May at age 53. His death came as a 
sorrowful blow to his colleagues and to his company. 
</P>
<P>
He had, after all, given the world Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie and the other 
Muppets, along with "Sesame Street" and Muppet Babies -- not to mention lesser 
achievements like "The Storyteller" and "Fraggle Rock" which others in Jim 
Henson's line of work would be proud to call their masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
Now his elder son Brian surveys from a balcony the work being done on this day 
at the Creature Shop. Brian Henson, like the mice in the corner, does not 
blink. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a drop in morale when my father died," he says quietly. "A large 
percentage of the company was crying about it two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was in emotional turmoil. But that period also hardened their drive, 
and their feelings for what he wanted. Now they're probably more motivated to 
keep the dream alive than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Henson reminds one inevitably of his father. The same shy, lopsided grin 
is in evidence, as is a slightly diffident manner and a soft Canadian burr. 
Though Brian is clean-shaven, he too has a long face with an aquiline profile, 
framed by masses of hair. 
</P>
<P>
He is being spoken of as the keeper of the flame, the man who, at 26, will 
carry Jim Henson's vision into the 21st Century. But will it happen? 
</P>
<P>
Brian Henson pauses a long time. "It's too early to say," he says finally. "I'd 
been working with my father for eight or nine years -- in production, direction 
and here at the shop as performance head. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the same kind of background that he had by this age, but to a lesser 
degree. I've developed an interest in performance, in directing and in (puppet) 
characters. And I'll also get involved in the company, because . . ." and he 
pauses again for a long time, "I have been his apprentice." 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't all that constitute assuming his father's mantle? "To a degree, yes," 
says Henson. "Which is a slightly scary prospect. But it's exciting at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, that mantle is not quite as big as people think. People know of my 
father's creative work, but what they don't know is the way he chose people to 
work with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted the company to run itself so he could still be a performer and a 
director. It meant he could be a father figure and not a boss. 
</P>
<P>
"So he chose creative, self-motivated people. He tended to pick people who were 
still young, a lot of them under 20, and they'd stick with him. That's how 
we're managing to carry on right now, because everyone's so motivated. Here, 
we're currently going through our heaviest amount of production ever." 
</P>
<P>
Henson sold many of his Muppet characters and the New York-based Henson 
Associates Inc. to Walt Disney Co. last year for an estimated $150-200 million. 
But Jim Henson Productions, which runs the Creature Shops here and in New York, 
has stayed within the family and functions like an independent production 
company, pitching its expertise to would-be collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the London shop's work is being taken up by the sequel to "Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles." The huge success of the first movie, also done at the 
shop, prompted a decision to mine the same ore quickly, and Creature Shop 
craftsmen are working against tight deadlines to ready their creations for the 
second movie. 
</P>
<P>
The Henson contingent admit to reservations about the first Turtles film, 
feeling it veered uneasily between harmless cartoon-style entertainment for 
children and a hard-edged assault on the senses with violent overtones. 
</P>
<P>
"The Witches," says Brian Henson, was a far more challenging and complex task. 
Dahl's story is of a boy who uncovers a plot by witches to rid England of small 
children by turning them into mice with a specially concocted magic potion. 
</P>
<P>
"Real witches," as Dahl tells it, "dress in ordinary clothes and look very much 
like ordinary women . . . that is why they are so hard to catch." 
</P>
<P>
But when the boy hero of the story (played by young Chicago actor Jasen Fisher) 
stumbles on a witches' convention at a seaside hotel led by the Grand High 
Witch (Huston), he and a boy he befriends are turned into mice before they can 
combat their evil plans. 
</P>
<P>
The film is directed by Nicolas Roeg, the maverick Briton whose movies such as 
"Bad Timing," "Castaway" and "Track 29" combine a dazzling visual sense, adult 
themes and a freewheeling directing style. 
</P>
<P>
A collaboration between Roeg and Jim Henson seemed improbable, to put it 
mildly. "One thing everyone knew before hand," says Brian Henson, who was 
coordinating puppeteer on "The Witches," working closely with Roeg, "was that 
they had no idea what the movie would look like." 
</P>
<P>
Roeg, a father of six, insists he has made a film for children: "It speaks to a 
group, the 6 to 12 year olds, who I think have been overlooked," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are flashes of vintage Roeg brilliance, notably in a highly filmic 
sequence (not in Dahl's book) where the two mice are chased by witches under 
chairs and tables in the hotel's convention hall, then through air vents below 
ground. "One hopes that if it has some kind of truthfulness, all the people 
will enjoy it too," concedes Roeg. 
</P>
<P>
Technical problems in make-up and animatronics were immense. Each witch had to 
spend an hour each day being transformed from ordinary women. Anjelica Huston, 
whose metamorphosis involved latex prostheses including an enormous hooked 
nose, chin whiskers and skin so wrinkled it looks scarred, spent two hours 
daily being made up. 
</P>
<P>
The Creature Shop had to make electronically controlled mice in three sizes, 
said John Stephenson, its creative supervisor. Lifesize mice were created for 
long shots; two mice ten or 12 inches high were used in medium shots in which 
they had to blink or move their jaws or ears and large hand puppets were 
employed for close-ups and emphasizing facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that the script called for a huge amount of mouse movement," 
added Stephenson. "The whole film was difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Though "The Witches" opened in London in May to good business, strong word of 
mouth and generally excellent reviews, it has also been marked by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Roeg's film has infuriated Roald Dahl, who has in general not liked film 
adaptations of his work. In the past, he has criticized the movies of "Charlie 
and the Chocolate Factory" (released in this country as "Willy Wonka and the 
Chocolate Factory") and last year's "Danny, The Champion of the World," which 
was shown in the U.S. on the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
As happened with "Danny," the ending of "The Witches" has been changed on film, 
and has become more upbeat. Also, the unnamed English boy who narrates the 
book's story has been given a name -- Luke -- and has become American. 
</P>
<P>
The film, the 73-year-old Dahl has said, is "utterly appalling." He tried, in 
vain, to have his name removed from the credits. He feels that it is aimed at 
an audience of adults rather than children, and told an interviewer earlier 
this year: "I want it known that I wouldn't allow a child to see it, let alone 
encourage one to do so." 
</P>
<P>
(According to a spokeswoman at Puffin Books, Dahl's publishers, he is currently 
undergoing hospital tests and was unavailable for further comment.) 
</P>
<P>
Dahl's public comments about the film adaptation of "The Witches" brought an 
angry response from its screenwriter, Allan Scott, who in an article written 
for the Guardian newspaper called him "curmudgeonly." The film, said Scott, 
"is, with the exceptions that apparently offend (Dahl), faithful to the book 
and its spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect, impact and nature of a film is utterly different to that of a 
novel, and most novelists recognize this difference with good grace or at least 
well-remunerated silence." 
</P>
<P>
Scott has written three other films adapted from books and directed by Roeg -- 
"Castaway," the forthcoming "Cold Heaven" and (with Chris Bryant) the highly 
regarded "Don't Look Now." 
</P>
<P>
"All have been faithful to the original material in the sense that they were 
serious attempts to recreate in a wholly different medium from which they were 
derived," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Scott advised novelists contemplating the sale of a work to the film industry 
"to remember that word 'industry' and bid the book goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not willing to take the risk, refuse the blandishments, the (huge) 
sums of money and the fame -- and stick to your own lathe. Even children know 
that having your cake and eating it is not a maxim to be tampered with." 
</P>
<P>
Others involved in the film have closed ranks against Dahl's criticisms. "I 
like our ending," says Brian Henson. "It helps the film's structure, and it 
makes for a more rounded story. Roald Dahl is fabulously talented, but I think 
he thinks if anyone else works with his work, it's going to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Roeg also applauds Dahl's talent, but adds: "This happens when you translate 
from one medium to another. (Books) are a medium of total imagination, and 
everyone can imagine a character differently. But when you have to show the 
Grand High Witch, how can it look like what someone else thinks it should look 
like? You have to make that leap." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a success in America for "The Witches" would be a strong psychological 
boost for the Henson Organization in the wake of its founder's death. 
</P>
<P>
This is why Brian Henson now swivels nervously in his chair on the Creature 
Shop balcony, enumerating his worries. Will everything depend on the first 
weekend for what is essentially a word-of-mouth movie? Is 16 cities a wide 
enough release? Would it have been better to open it last Halloween? 
</P>
<P>
Henson, of course, feels the weight of family expectations on his shoulders. 
His four siblings show signs of making the Hensons an all-entertainment 
industry family. His eldest sister Lisa is senior vice president of production 
at Warner Bros.; Cheryl Henson is a puppeteer and designer, younger brother 
John is also a puppeteer and has directed student films, and youngest child 
Heather is at Rhode Island School of Design. 
</P>
<P>
"When I say my father was a father figure, it was really true," says Brian. "We 
kids would come into the Creature Shops at weekends growing up, and everyone 
treated us like they were our aunts and uncles." 
</P>
<P>
John Stephenson is more detached and relaxed about the family firm's future. 
"Jim was a subliminal presence, a gentle hand on the tiller," he observes. "He 
was quality control -- extremely fussy about what got in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're very busy, there are 10 or 15 projects on the books in the States. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim has left us an awful lot to be going on with."
