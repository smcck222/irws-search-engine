Ah, summer: Picnics, trips to the beach, back-yard barbecues -- and dogs 
chasing mailmen. 
</P>
<P>
"The summer is the worst time of the year for us," said Postal Service 
spokesman Dave Mazer. "At a lot of houses, the kids are home and the weather's 
warm so the front door is unlocked. The dog only has to put its paws on the 
screen door and he's out of there." 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize the need to keep Rover under control, some 200 uniformed carriers 
and their families marched from El Sereno Park to the El Sereno station in 
Northeast Los Angeles, carrying signs that said things like, "Put the Bite on 
Dog Attacks." 
</P>
<P>
Postal nips in the city number 56 this year -- an increase of 12% over last 
year -- and more than a third of the incidents have occurred in the Northeast 
section for reasons that no one can explain. 
</P>
<P>
"The dogs seem bigger and more aggressive nowadays," Mazer said. "I guess it's 
the age we're living in. They're trained to protect. And some times they get 
carried away." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, at least in Southern California, the enemy is visible. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard of a case in Florida," said Mazer, "where a letter carrier was bitten 
by a snake." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of fangs . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, television shows about local cops, such as "Dragnet" and 
"Badge 714," received the official endorsement of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, "Nick Knight," a two-hour pilot about a Los Angeles police detective 
that was broadcast on CBS Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the LAPD stamp of approval was missing because Detective Knight has a 
personal problem: He's a vampire. 
</P>
<P>
Works in the canine unit, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Television game shows have their own special lingo. And it's ironic that one of 
our oldest and most conservative cities would give its name to a type of 
prospective contestant who's deemed too bizarre or boring to be selected. But 
that's the case, according to Newsweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The name evolved from the expression, "Pass on this one." When producers want 
to reject a contestant, they explain: "He's a Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
Motorists nearing Los Angeles could be excused for feeling as though they're 
being pulled in opposite directions philosophically as well as geographically 
by back-to-back billboards on the San Bernardino Freeway, as the accompanying 
photo suggests. 
</P>

MARINA DEL REY, FOREIGN LEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just read the article ("Secret Foreign Group gets 49.9% Stake in Prime Marina 
Leases" Part II, Aug. 9) about the L.A. County Board of Supervisors unanimously 
approving a deal giving a group of anonymous foreign investors a large share of 
the long-term leases in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The article also indicates that Abraham Lurie gave four of the five county 
supervisors more than $27,000 over the past three years. I note that it is 
Lurie who proposed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie is the largest lease-holder in the Marina and apparently he needs a quick 
transfusionof foreign cash to continue the "over-development" of the Marina. 
</P>
<P>
One thing I'm not quite clear on, though. The county supervisors just gave a 
large percentage of the Marina's leases to foreign investors whose identities 
are unknown. So how come I, an American citizen, have to provide my entire 
financial, employment and in general, life history if I want to rent so much as 
a one-room apartment or a boat slip in the Marina?

'A NEW AGE' OF ENERGY SAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Energy: A New Age," Aug. 10) regarding the need for action in 
the area of energy conservation calls for some comment. 
</P>
<P>
Your proposals to force builders to incorporate energy conservation gimmicks in 
their new construction sounds like yet another well-intentioned attempt to 
provide for the common good. To your credit, you do recognize the disruptions 
to be expected but your proposed solutions sound awful. 
</P>
<P>
You propose tax incentives to cushion the builder from the economic adversity 
brought upon him by your laws, and low-interest loans for the home buyer so 
that he may be able to afford to buy. Both of these proposals will exacerbate 
the most pressing economic problems that we face today. 
</P>
<P>
The tax benefits will reduce tax revenues collected from the builders and the 
low-interest loans will undermine the solvency of the financial sector. The net 
effect on the deficit and the need for a government bailout of the savings and 
loan industry should make us pause for thought. 
</P>
<P>
We should ask ourselves if the mechanism of the market is truly inadequate to 
guide the home builders and home buyers in their economic decisions. Are we 
sure that they are doing such a poor job of planning? Our free markets have 
done quite well in the past as they diverted us from the perils of running out 
of leather, wood, whale oil, and rubber. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps our Public Utilities Commission planners and your editors will be 
surprised at how well industry will provide for our energy needs and how well 
the public will respond to change.

'A NEW AGE' OF ENERGY SAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Energy: A New Age," does well to point out the need for 
California to practice energy conservation. However, you state that "at the 
moment, there is no such thing as an environmentally benign electric power 
plant." Such power plants do exist today and Luz utility-scale solar power 
plants have received national attention in The Times, the Washington Post and 
other prestigious publications. It is important for your readers to know that 
viable solutions to the problems posed in your editorial do exist. 
</P>
<P>
Luz International Ltd. has brought solar power to utility scale and currently 
produces more than 90% of the world's solar electricity. With seven solar 
energy plants operating in the Mojave Desert outside of Los Angeles, Luz is 
supplying the Southern California Edison utility grid with nearly 200 megawatts 
of electricity, enough for the residential needs of 270,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
We are now constructing the first of five planned 80-megawatt solar plants 
which will be competitive with oil and coal peaking plants at less than 8 cents 
per kilowatt hour. With completion of the five 80-megawatt plants in 1994, 
Luz's production of solar electricity will total almost 600 megawatts, enough 
electricity to serve the residential needs of over 800,000 Californians.

'A NEW AGE' OF ENERGY SAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial is a timely review of the benefits of energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
However, California developers, contrary to public belief, are intimately 
familiar with the most stringent energy regulations in this country. After all, 
they could not get building permits if they did not meet the tough state energy 
code. 
</P>
<P>
Building industry associations throughout the state are attempting to simplify 
the approval process to broaden use of new energy-conserving materials and 
equipment. In 1983, the building industry developed a way to calculate energy 
conservation which is now considered an ideal model for future regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The real issue is how to educate the public on the benefits of energy 
conservation. According to a leading research laboratory, 50% of residential 
energy consumption is a function of life style, regardless of the energy-saving 
devices installed by builders. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the energy waste comes from houses built before 1978. No significant 
energy reduction campaign has been directed to this segment, only token 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
How can we stop the current trend toward more electrical appliances, wasteful 
packaging and larger, gas-guzzling cars? 
</P>
<P>
Politicians will not do it for fear of voter rebellion. Manufacturers will not 
do it because of enormous targeting costs. 
</P>
<P>
Educating the public is a task The Times could initiate. Please put your pen 
and energy to work and start the process.

MAKING PEACE IS POLITICAL; 
</P>
<P>
REJECTING WAR, NICARAGUA NOW RELIES ON DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTURO J. CRUZ, Arturo J. Cruz, a 1984 candidate for the Nicaraguan 
presidency, is senior research associate of the Institute of Inter-American 
Studies at the University of Miami. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Central American presidents move their itinerant summit from one meeting 
place to another, they seem to get closer to their goal of peace in the region. 
At the Honduran port of Tela on Aug. 7, they finally established a timetable 
and means to implement their peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the presidents not only continue to make strides in conflict 
resolution in Nicaragua, but also have started to place more emphasis on the 
other focus of civil war -- El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
This progress is the result of a combination of changes in the terms of the 
original equation in the quest for peace. The first was the replacement of the 
Contadora Group as peace broker by the Central American governments themselves. 
The second, and by far the most determinant, was a bipartisan consensus in the 
United States to sever ties with the Contras. The third has been the entente 
cordiale of Washington and Moscow, incipient that it may be. In addition, there 
are a number of other factors that constitute stimuli to compromise, such as 
the lack of clear winners in the protracted guerrilla war, the insurmountable 
economic disaster of Nicaragua and its refugee problem, which is seriously 
affecting Honduras, Costa Rica and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is not a uniform opinion. Persons who regard the Arias peace 
plan as a panacea for a beleaguered Central America assert that we are 
witnessing the gradual unfolding of a peacemaking process activated by the 
natural impulse in man to use reason when force has failed. Others rebuff this 
proposition as naive. Drawing conclusions from the duplicity evidenced by the 
Central American radical left during an entire decade, they dismiss both the 
ruling Sandinistas of Nicaragua and the Salvadoran guerrillas as miscreants who 
will never accept democracy. 
</P>
<P>
There is a third, more pragmatic, school of thought. Its adherents, including 
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, are as distrustful of the professed 
sincerity of the Sandinistas and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
as any pro-war hard-liner. However, they rely on the diplomatic summit accords 
to halt a futile and devastating conflict. Aware that we all need a respite, 
they have attempted a truce as a stepping stone to effective peace. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some indignant anti-Sandinistas decry the Tela accords, labeling the 
demobilization of the Nicaraguan Resistance forces as a "sellout." These 
critics fail to realize that this action was necessary in order to deprive the 
Sandinistas of excuses. Furthermore, it is an explicit request made by the 
opposition political parties in a public agreement with the Sandinista 
government signed at Managua on Aug. 4. The Nicaraguan Resistance now lacks a 
legal reason to continue waging war. Similarly, the United States government 
cannot ignore the wishes of the Nicaraguan democratic opposition. In fact, the 
latter's leadership has asked "the foreign governments with interests in the 
Central American region to abstain from carrying out any concealed activities 
in the Nicaraguan electoral process." Interested in peace, the Bush 
Administration supports the Central American initiative. But in order to 
appease its most conservative constituency, it still speaks to the Sandinistas 
with a harsh rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, though, has a legitimate concern to see the Sandinistas 
fulfill their pledge guaranteeing the safe return of the rebels and their 
families to Nicaragua from Honduras. Many of them are small farmers and other 
campesinos who raised arms against Sandinista injustice. President Bush could 
go a long way toward restoring peace in Nicaragua, and U.S.-Nicaraguan 
relations, if he proposed to use his influence and support -- together with 
other heads of state, the World Bank and various other international agencies 
-- to help launch a resettlement program, in Nicaragua, of both the Contras and 
other refugees. With a multilateral guarantee for the pursuit of life with 
work, social services and the enjoyment of freedoms, those Nicaraguans who have 
sought asylum abroad would be enticed to return home. However, such a project 
to restore our dignity as Nicaraguans can be possible only if the Sandinista 
regime takes a sincere decision to adopt democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the way things stand today in Nicaragua, everything hinges on 
the forthcoming elections. In spite of their bravado, the Sandinistas must fear 
the elections since they are fully aware of the tremendous erosion of their 
popular support base. They also know that there will be so many international 
observers that it would be rather difficult for them to conceal fraud. In 
typical fashion, some of their spokesmen have declared that if they lose the 
elections, they are disposed to surrender the government but not power. More 
recently, they have gone further, hinting that they might consider giving up 
power, as well. That is senseless talk. In either scenario, the Sandinistas, 
once deprived of the national budget, would see their capacity to reward and 
punish (the foundation to authoritarian power) greatly diminished. It is hard 
to imagine the Ortega brothers, Tomas Borge and the rest of the comandantes 
stepping down from power to watch passively as the Sandinistas become an 
insignificant political party. 
</P>
<P>
It is more realistic for the international community to foster pluralism and 
common goals in Nicaragua. By the same token, the Central American presidents 
must demand that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega immediately meet his 
obligations under the Tela accords and display genuine efforts to persuade the 
Salvadoran guerrillas to make peace with President Alfredo Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will soon be sending a peacekeeping force to Nicaragua. That 
is a positive step. God willing, the Central American presidents will meet 
again some time later in the year at Managua. One important step that should 
come out of that meeting would be a request for a U.N. peacekeeping force in El 
Salvador, too. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States should contemplate a policy of continuing and 
vigorous support to the Central American presidents' peace initiatives. When 
the presidents succeed in their task, the nightmare of civil wars and refugees 
will fade away.

A WARM-MILK TOAST TO MACHO PERENNIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman is a syndicated columnist in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, in preparation for Aug. 26, the anniversary of the passage of 
women's suffrage, I gather together a list of those people who have done the 
most in the past 12 months to slow the progress of women. In deference to our 
foremothers, I then with great fanfare dispense the Equal Rites Award. 
</P>
<P>
This year, even without such perennial winners as Ronald Reagan and Ed Meese. 
</P>
<P>
The competition was every bit as keen as ever. And so without further ado, the 
envelopes, please. 
</P>
<P>
We begin with the ever-popular Raging Hormonal Imbalance Award. This 
testosterone special goes to none other than Mike Tyson for his many acts in 
and out of the ring and most especially for his boy-talk relayed by 
buddy-author Jose Torres: "I like to hurt women when I make love to them. I 
like to hear them scream with pain . . . It gives me pleasure." Mike's denial? 
"I don't have any problems dating anybody. Thank God." To Mike, we send a glass 
of warm milk, an estrogen tablet and a lonely Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
As for high-flyers, The Male-Adjusted Mogul Prize goes with deep regrets to Al 
Neuharth, the retired founder of USA Today. After years sheltered in a 
corporate jet, Al is back to reality complaining that flight attendants are no 
longer young, single and nubile, but are "aging women who are tired of their 
jobs or flighty young men . . . ." His solution? "Bring back the skygirls." Our 
prize? A second career for Neuharth: "I'm Al. Fly me." 
</P>
<P>
While we are talking images, the hotly contested Ms-Guided Madison Avenue Award 
must go to the folks who penned the Camel campaign. They offered a set of 
instructions for Camel men out to pick up women: "Run into the water, grab 
someone and drag her back to the shore. . . . The more she kicks and screams, 
the better." We send them a plaque: Warning: This ad may be dangerous for your 
product's health. 
</P>
<P>
A special Entrepreneur With an Attitude Award goes to Harry E. Figgie Jr, 
chairman of Figgie International, who told Fortune magazine, "You don't build a 
company like this with lace on your underwear." To him we ship a special 
catalogue full of Victoria's Secrets for Success. Try it. 
</P>
<P>
Now for the Blind Justice Award. This year there were so many contestants the 
award is being shared by two of the jurists who labored mightily for 
recognition. One goes to the New York judge who, in a flight of sensitivity, 
gave Don Lu Chen five years probation after he killed his wife with a hammer. 
The man was Chinese, the wife was unfaithful, the judge explained: "He was a 
product of his culture." To him we send a misfortune cookie. 
</P>
<P>
The other goes to an equally understanding judge in Michigan who lightened the 
sentence of a convicted rapist to three years' probation and $200 compensation. 
The judge explained that he didn't want to prevent the rapist from achieving 
his goal: becoming a police officer. We give this judge a new phone number: 
911. 
</P>
<P>
Lest you think it's just the American legal system that has gone awry, a 
special mention goes winging its way to Korea where a woman was convicted and 
sentenced to six months in jail for biting off the tongue of a rapist. We send 
the judge a booklet titled "The Korean Art of Self-Defense." The pages are 
blank. 
</P>
<P>
On now to the Dubious Equality Award for the woman who fought the hardest for 
the most questionable achievement. This year it goes to Roseanne Barr for her 
effort to prove women, too, can dump on men: "You may marry the man of your 
dreams, ladies, but 15 years later you are married to a reclining chair that 
burps." We send her a liberated laugh-track. Silent. 
</P>
<P>
The G-String for Gratuitous Sex was pulled out of the closet this year and will 
be sent post-haste to Life magazine for its June cover story: "Hurrah for the 
Bra." This titillating anniversary issue offered 100 years of pulchritude 
disguised as history. To them, we send a shirt and a story idea: Hurrah for the 
Jock Strap. 
</P>
<P>
Now on to the International Backlash Award, which has gone in previous years to 
assorted ayatollahs. This year it goes to Japan's prime minister, Sousuke Uno, 
the guy with the geisha, and to his agricultural minister, Hisao Horinouchi, 
who said, "It is wrong for women to come to the forefront of politics." We send 
them no prize because they already got what they deserved: defeat at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Success at the cash register has brought the winner of the Sexism in Song Prize 
to our notice. This prize has shifted from various hard-rockers to the rap 
group N.W.A., which in lyrics too rank to repeat here has advocated a use 'em 
and throw 'em away approach to women. We give them a one-way ticket to the 
women's museum at Seneca Falls. This includes a trip over the falls in a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a prize is surely due to that marketing genius who has found a novel 
product to keep the male ego inflated. So the Macho in Merchandizing Award goes 
to David Mayer of Mayers Lab for creating Maxx (sic), a condom that is 25% 
larger than the others. To Mr. Mayer we send the perfect accompaniment to Maxx: 
helium.

RAMS RECOVER JUST IN TIME TO WIN, 23-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams, who limped and sputtered through two exhibition games with makeshift 
lineups and few memories to speak of, had a coming out of sorts Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Cardinals appeared ready to win until rookie Jeff Carlson's pass to 
Flipper Anderson went 45 yards for a touchdown with 20 seconds to play, giving 
the Rams a 23-20 victory. The Cardinals had previously taken a 20-17 lead on a 
37-yard field goal by Al Del Greco with 14:50 left in front of 39,666 fans at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rally, the Rams' first team, as it turns out, will not go the 
entire season without scoring a touchdown, ending a developing drama late in 
the first quarter on a one-yard run by Robert Delpino. 
</P>
<P>
At times both offense and defense sizzled. Sometimes both burned. But there was 
finally signs of life, most notably from a set of aging wheels belonging to 
LeRoy Irvin, a 31-year-old cornerback in search of a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, who didn't have his best season in 1988 and is talking about retirement 
after this one, was suddenly young again. He finished a short night's work with 
two first-half interceptions. With 8:54 left in the first quarter, he stepped 
in front of a Gary Hogeboom pass and returned it five yards to the Phoenix 
26-yard line, setting up Delpino's scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin picked off another Hogeboom pass late in the half and returned it nine 
yards. Other first-half stories included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Delpino. The fifth-round pick of a year ago got his first real shot 
at the tailback spot with starter Greg Bell out of camp and Gaston Green 
hurting. Delpino, not the hometown bonus baby, figures he's going to have to 
turn some heads to win the job outright, and did his best to do just that. 
Delpino worked the first half and gained 44 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Everett. His numbers weren't the greatest, six completions in 16 
attempts, but he threw for 112 yards and a touchdown in his half of work. 
Everett started fast, connecting with Anderson for 46 yards on his first pass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Stams. The rookie linebacker from Notre Dame made his first big 
impression, blocking a first-half punt that led to a Rams' touchdown 
</P>
<P>
The news wasn't all good, though. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams got a big scare with 10:07 left in the third quarter when backup 
quarterback Mark Herrmann was blindsided on a safety blitz by Phoenix safety 
Tim McDonald. The hit jarred the ball from Herrmann, and it bounded to former 
UCLA standout Jim Wahler, who raced 40 yards to the 10 before being dragged 
down by Richard Calvin. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann remained on his back for several minutes after the play but left the 
field under his own power. He was taken by cart to the locker room, where it 
was determined Herrmann had a fractured rib on his left side. He's expected to 
be sidelined three to four weeks, which puts some heat on Carlson, who worked 
the rest of the game in relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, that's a big blow for us," Ram Coach John Robinson said about 
Herrmann's injury. "That's part of this game. You're never to the point where 
you have enough depth. He's had a good preseason, but his preseason's over 
now." 
</P>
<P>
But it's just beginning for the rookie Carlson, who threw the game-winning pass 
to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a prospect," Robinson said. "He kind of goes out there and wings it. But 
there's prospect and NFL quarterback, and there's a lot of distance between the 
two." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals wasted little time taking advantage of the hit on Herrmann, 
scoring on the first down after the big play, when Lydell Carr ran 10 yards to 
tie the game, at 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams scored first with 5:42 left in the first quarter on a one-yard run by 
Delpino, capping a 26-yard drive after Irvin's first interception. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals drove from their 35-yard line to the Rams' four on their next 
possession after key passes of 22 and 14 yards from Hogeboom to the veteran Roy 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
But the drive was abruptly stopped by linebacker Kevin Greene, who sacked 
Hogeboom for an eight-yard loss on third and four at the Rams' four. The 
Cardinals settled for Del Greco's 29-yard field goal to cut the lead to 7-3 
with 13:50 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, led by Delpino and Everett, charged back. On first down, Everett's 
pass to Ellard worked for 26 yards to the Phoenix 39. Everett later completed a 
pass to Thomas Henley for 12 yards, but the drive stalled at the 22 and the 
Rams settled for a 39-yard Mike Lansford field goal to make it 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the special teams stepped in. Rookie Stams, the second-round pick from 
Notre Dame, broke through the line and blocked Rich Camarillo's punt at the 20, 
the ball rolling toward the end zone. Rams Clifford Hicks and George Bethune 
fought for control, with Bethune finally falling on the ball and rolling into 
the end zone for a touchdown with 9:43 left. That put the Rams ahead, 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals cut the lead to 17-10 with 1:12 left in the half on a one-yard 
run by Tony Jordan, capping a 65-yard drive that took only five plays, thanks 
to a 46-yard pass from Hogeboom to Robert Awalt on first down from the Phoenix 
35. 
</P>
<P>
Hogeboom, who signed with Phoenix as a Plan B free agent in the off-season, 
rebounded strongly after a weak performance in the Cardinals' exhibition opener 
against Seattle last week. In that game, Hogeboom threw three interceptions in 
the first half. Monday night, he completed nine of 14 passes for 150 yards in 
the first half, although he did give up the two interceptions to Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The agent for Ram holdouts Greg Bell, Robert Cox and Duval Love last spoke to 
Rams' management on Saturday and reported no progress in negotiations. "The 
Rams indicated to me that with my players out, they've had time to look at 
other players and were very pleased," Steve Feldman said Monday. Feldman added 
that it was never his intention to take advantage of his holdouts and the new 
80-player roster limit, which has made training camp even more difficult for 
the Rams. "The last thing any of the players wants to do is distract training 
camp in any manner." 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Mike Lansford, who signed a temporary one-year contract to get to camp 
on time, has been closely monitoring the negotiations of other kickers in the 
league. Detroit's Eddie Murray recently signed a three-year deal for $1.1 
million. New Orleans kicker Morten Andersen, who figures to set the standard 
for kickers, signed a four-year deal Monday. Though terms were not revealed, 
Andersen's deal reportedly could average about $500,000 per year with signing 
bonus and incentives. Lansford earned $195,000 last season. . . . Navy 
Tuiasasopo started at left guard for the Rams. He replaced eighth-round pick 
Warren Wheat (injured neck), who was filling in for starter Tom Newberry 
(hamstring). . . . Rookie Vernon Kirk, the team's ninth-round pick, started at 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams play host to the Minnesota Vikings next Saturday night in the 44th 
annual Times/Rams Charity game at Anaheim Stadium. . . . Linebacker Mel Owens 
pinched a nerve in his neck in the first quarter but later returned. . . . 
Tailback Gaston Green, who is recovering from a bruised left thigh, was not in 
uniform Monday night. . . . Phoenix tight end Robert Awalt had injured ribs 
after taking a vicious hit from safety Jerry Gray after a 46-yard reception 
late in the first half. X-rays were negative, but Awalt did not return for the 
second half.

PROFIT TAKERS CUT STOCK RALLY OFF; DOW SLIDES 40.97

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market's two-month-long rally was dealt a serious blow Monday after 
profit taking and a late wave of computer-based program trading pounded blue 
chips to a sharply lower finish. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 40.97 to 2,647.00, for its biggest 
one-day loss since it dropped 46.47 on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of July, the 30-share Dow index had gained more than 11%. 
Only two weeks ago, stocks closed above the 2,700 level for the first time in 
two years and appeared poised to break through an all-time closing high of 
2,722.42 set Aug. 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, the market's price gains have been muted, and trading had been 
confined to a fairly narrow range on low volume. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said a pullback had been expected, noting that blue chips have risen 
for the past seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The inability of blue chips to decisively cross their all-time closing high may 
have also bothered some investors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"What worries me is that the pattern for market behavior is beginning to 
closely reflect 1987," said Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal 
&amp; Co., noting that blue chips also rose to new highs in August, 1987, two 
months before the stock market crashed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barbanel said many other factors are different from two years ago, 
including a moderate interest rate environment and more reasonable 
price/earnings ratios among big companies. 
</P>
<P>
Not all observers of Monday's market decline were discouraged. Ken Ducey, a 
senior vice president at S. G. Warburg, said the selloff occurred on relatively 
mild volume. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices started lower Monday and stayed depressed despite early strength 
in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates fell in early trading in the credit markets but then reversed 
course and headed higher as the day progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric dropped 1 1/2 to 56 1/2, 
International Business Machines fell 2 1/8 to 113, Exxon dipped 1/2 to 43 1/4, 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph retreated 1 1/4 to 38 1/4 and USX fell 5/8 
to 33 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
An exception to the downtrend was Dow Chemical, which gained 1/4 to 100 and 
traded as high as 101 5/8. The company said it had no news to report that would 
account for the advance. 
</P>
<P>
Lyphomed jumped 7 3/4 to 30 1/4 as the most active issue in the 
over-the-counter market. The company said Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, which owns 
about 30% of its stock, proposed to acquire the rest for $31 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Among individual issues, Squibb added 3/8 to 112 7/8. The company attributed 
the gain to the higher share price of its merger partner, Bristol-Myers Corp., 
which rose 3/8 to 48 3/4 and was the most actively traded stock on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
Deltona, also traded on the NYSE, climbed 1 3/8 to 5 3/4. The company, which 
had earlier rejected a takeover proposal from Sycamore Acquisitions Corp., said 
Sycamore made a new offer valued at about $7.01 a share. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Corp. rose 2 3/4 to 273 3/4 as investors continued to bet that the airline 
company would be the subject of a bidding war. British Airways and Texas 
investor Robert M. Bass are said to be interested in acquiring the company. Los 
Angeles investor Marvin Davis has offered $6.19 billion for UAL. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks rose to a record close as program trading lifted the market 
despite lackluster sentiment. The key Nikkei 225-share index rose 77.69 to 
close at 35,140.83 after easing 26.97 Friday. The previous record close of 
35,090.11 was set on August 17. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, share prices fell slightly, as conflicting 
factors affecting the market canceled each other out. The Financial Times 
100-share index closed 0.4 lower at 2,374.7. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices also fell in light, erratic trading after an early rally dissolved 
in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 11/16 point at one point in the 
day, but finished the session with a decline of 3/16 point, or $1.88, for every 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
The bond's yield rose to 8.17% from 8.15% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
There was no obvious reason for the market's downward turn aside from 
changeable sentiment. Several factors were cited by analysts, including the 
reported sale of nearly $900 million in mortgage-backed securities by Gibraltar 
Savings, a Los Angeles-based thrift that is under federal control. Gibraltar 
did not immediately confirm the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Also weighing on the market was concern about investors' appetite for more than 
$26 billion in one-, two- and five-year securities being auctioned by the 
Treasury this week. 
</P>
<P>
A decision by the Federal Reserve Board to allow Japanese firms to remain as 
primary dealers in the U.S. government bond market helped prices in early 
trading, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the light volume tended to exaggerate price movements. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just technical trading today," said Rich Spurgin, director of 
fixed-income research at Technical Data Global Markets Group in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term issues were 
1/32 to 5/32 point lower, intermediate securities were down 3/16 to 9/32 point 
and long-term issues were down as much as 5/16 point, according to Telerate 
Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in a $1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 1.75 to 1,175.61. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate bond prices edged higher. Moody's investment grade corporate bond 
index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, was 328.61, up 0.36. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds fell 1/8 point. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.33% from 7.32% 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.875%, unchanged from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mixed against key foreign currencies in thin, lackluster 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose slightly. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion 
for current delivery closed 30 cents higher at $368.40 an ounce. Republic 
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $366.35, up 35 cents from 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said that in the absence of any new economic data, the dollar 
drifted in a narrow trading range dominated mostly by internal market forces. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar had risen sharply last Thursday after the release of a 
better-than-expected U.S. trade report for July but ended the week lower as 
dealers cashed in on the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was described as thin Monday, with many dealers out on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 0.17 Japanese yen to close at 143.35 yen. It was quoted at a lower rate of 
142.80 yen in London, and at 143.05 yen in New York, up from 142.60 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against the British pound in London and New York. It cost 
$1.5745 to buy one pound in London, up from $1.5655 late Friday. Sterling 
fetched $1.5720 in New York, up from $1.5659. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of cocoa futures plunged to life-of-contract lows after indications that 
two major producers would no longer back current price support levels. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, soybeans weathered early pressure and made a dramatic 
turnaround on heavy professional buying and copper finished higher. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa prices slipped as low as $69 before settling $46 to $57 lower on the New 
York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery at $1,108 
a metric ton. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-programmed selling greased the slide, but traders found no shortage of 
bad news Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The world's leading cocoa producer, Ivory Coast, suggested that the price 
support level set by the International Cocoa Organization may be nearly 10% too 
high. Malaysia, the fourth-leading producer and considered by many a crucial 
player in any ICCO pact, reiterated that it would not join the organization 
until it sorts out "domestic problems." 
</P>
<P>
"The market was very demoralized. It's clear there's much cocoa already out 
there, and the 1989-90 crop is in very good shape," said Arthur Stevenson, who 
tracks cocoa for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. "And matters could 
be further complicated if there is continued disagreement over what price can 
be defended." 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures mostly were lower, but soybean prices were sharply higher on the 
Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Traders credited heavy professional buying, led by Refco Inc. and 
Rosenthal-Collins in lots of 2 million bushels each, with sparking the 
turnaround in soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean prices drifted downward at the opening after weekend rain brightened 
prospects for the crop. But after prices held firmer than expected, buyers 
stepped in and began the upward move. 
</P>
<P>
"People who sold the market on the weekend rains might have been surprised," 
said Vic Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. "But 
we're headed back for more traditional August weather and the crops are going 
to need more than the rain in the forecast today and tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Wheat was 0.25 cent to 3.75 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in 
September at $3.9025 a bushel; corn was 0.50 cent lower to 0.25 cent higher, 
with September at $2.3475 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher, with 
September at $1.3875 a bushel; and soybeans were 4 to 12.25 cents higher, with 
August at $6.28 a bushel.

T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.99%, down from 8.01% last 
week. Another $7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 7.85%, up from 7.83% last week. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors -- 8.27% for three-month bills, with 
a $10,000 bill selling for $9,795.80 and 8.29% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,603.10. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

POWELL QUARTET INTRODUCED TO LA JOLLA AT SUMMERFEST '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Living composers and chamber music series do not usually seek each other out -- 
especially at the ultraconservative SummerFest series, this month in its fourth 
incarnation here. 
</P>
<P>
One active composer, CalArts professor and former jazz pianist Mel Powell, 
broke that tradition Sunday night at the third event of SummerFest '89. (The 
series continues through next Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
Powell attended a rousing, touching and apparently expert performance of his 
complex String Quartet (1982) by the Colorado Quartet, prefacing it with an 
amusing and provocative half-hour talk. 
</P>
<P>
This rambling introduction was fun, but not necessary. As Powell acknowledged 
during its length, "Music is autonomous -- it can speak for itself." 
</P>
<P>
And the 7-year-old work, being heard in San Diego County for the first time, 
does exactly that -- surprisingly, in the rigorous language of the Second 
Viennese School, the style of Schoenberg, Berg and Webern. It might have been 
written 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally charged, and moving from active contemplation, through heat and 
violence, toward a final, poignant reflectiveness, the 13-minute piece proceeds 
inexorably through a varied and vivid scenario. The ensemble -- violinists 
Julie Rosenfeld and Debra Redding, violist Francesca Martin and cellist Diane 
Chaplin -- achieved an admirable plateau of concentration in this performance. 
</P>
<P>
Similar plateaus materialized in the surrounding works, Brahms' early piano 
Quintet in F minor and Debussy's late Cello Sonata (1915). 
</P>
<P>
Substituting for Andre Previn -- reportedly still suffering a painful bout of 
tendinitis -- pianist Yefim Bronfman presided over a magisterial but 
spontaneous reading of the Brahms work in which his colleagues were violinists 
Andres Cardenes and Debra Redding, violist Heiichiro Ohyana (director of this 
festival since its beginning in 1986) and cellist Gary Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recalcitrance of a piano with the double and paradoxical 
disadvantage of an overbright sound and a pronounced lack of resonance, 
Bronfman and friends combined in this reading an easy authority with a 
passionate response to the Brahmsian drama. 
</P>
<P>
After a Classically balanced opening Allegro, the ensemble displayed a sense of 
discovery in each of the succeeding movements, which unfolded in felicitous and 
energetic contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
To begin this program, cellist Hoffman, with David Golub at the piano -- 
complementary and generous partners -- gave an exceptionally lucid, articulate 
and persuasively linear performance of the familiar Debussy Sonata, one which 
actually set up the emotional resonances to come in the Powell and Brahms 
Works.

A Wednesday press conference at Los Angeles City Hall hosted by Mayor Tom 
Bradley will kick off an unprecedented cultural exchange that will send Jewish 
musicians on a tour of the Soviet Union. Billed as a "folk-rock-Jewish-soul" 
tour, the five-city trek will feature Jewish folk music pioneer Shlomo 
Carlebach and the L.A.-based band Promised Land, with the first date set for 
Sept. 7 in Leningrad. The tour is the result of two years of planning and 
negotiations by music executive Stuart Wax who, according to a spokesman, 
"combines Orthodox Judaism with his love for rock music, especially the 
Grateful Dead." In exchange, the Soviet band Secrets plans to tour the United 
States next spring. Claudia Puig

DISNEY'S 'CHEETAH' GOES TO THE DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the great days of the Disney animal movies? Remember "Old Yeller" 
(hunting dogs)? "Perri" (squirrels)? "The Shaggy Dog" (anthropomorphic sheep 
dogs)? And all the others? 
</P>
<P>
Well, keep on remembering. And forget "Cheetah" (which opened Friday citywide): 
a new Disney Studio movie about California yuppies, transplanted to Kenya, and 
their adventures with an adopted cheetah cub and a nefarious gang of poachers 
and dog-racers. Shot on gorgeous African locations, stuffed to the brim with 
gazelles, lions, elephants, hippoes, rhinos and giraffes, the movie also 
features that less dignified species, human beings, here prone to hyperactive, 
pointless behavior, and annoying braying and yawping. 
</P>
<P>
Director Jeff Blyth, a travel movie specialist, gets some nice shots of animals 
in their habitat, though his humans mug, whine and philosophize incessantly. 
The three writers, however, deserve to be banished, in penance, to the nearest 
wildlife sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheetah" (MPAA rated G) is a gentle, dopey little movie, which tries to sneak 
by with good will and locations. But truly it must be said: Listening to bad 
dialogue is like chewing a brick. And cliches are like cheetahs. They break 
fast out of the gate, tire quickly and then drop back and go straight to the 
dogs. (A fine old Disney cartoon, "Mickey and the Seal" shows with "Cheetah" 
and upstages it completely.)

Rob Lowe, once facing possible charges for allegedly videotaping a 16-year-old 
girl performing a sex act last year, says he could be "the poster boy for bad 
judgment" but that his ethical code hasn't changed. "No, because there was 
never anything wrong with my ethics," said Lowe, interviewed in Los Angeles by 
correspondent Jim Brown for a segment to air Wednesday on NBC's "Today" show. 
It was one of the young actor's first interviews on the much-publicized taping 
incident in an Atlanta hotel during last summer's Democratic National 
Convention. He previously had declined to comment on the matter. In a 
settlement worked out last month with Atlanta authorities, Lowe, to avoid a 
possible criminal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor, agreed to work for 
20 hours with disadvantaged youths in Los Angeles. A transcript of the 
interview, made on the set of his new movie "Bad Influence," was made available 
Monday by NBC. In the segment, Lowe didn't directly refer to the taping 
incident, saying only that "I'm a man and I stand up to the mistakes I made. 
That's part of what being a man is. I made a mistake. "Thing is," he added, "I 
knew it immediately after making the mistake." He referred, although not 
specifically, to a civil suit still pending against him in Atlanta filed by the 
mother of the teen-ager in the alleged taping, claiming that Lowe seduced her 
daughter. The actor also was asked about stories claiming that after the 
Atlanta incident he destroyed a videotape library of what correspondent Brown 
called, without elaboration, "previous encounters." "That definitely is a 
falsehood," Lowe said. "I mean, I've read it all. I've read that I had raids on 
my house. I've truly heard it all and . . . I tell you something: It hurts me 
and it hurts my family, and these innuendoes are just no fun. No fun." Claudia

BOLIVIAN ENSEMBLE PRESENTS QUECHUAN MELODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the help of amplification and a few chord progressions and rhythms not 
necessarily indigenous to the Andes, a jazzed-up version of Quechuan music from 
Bolivia was handsomely displayed by the quintet Rumillajta (pronounced 
khoo-mi-YAH-ta) Sunday evening at the Wadsworth Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The native-Bolivian ensemble -- Adrian Villanueva, Juan Jorge Laura, Nester 
Tintayea, Juan Carlos Cordero and Miguel Angel Puna -- performed a lively, 
spirited set of eight original selections, all with short titles such as "The 
Condor." 
</P>
<P>
Several different sizes of antaras -- a Quechuan form of panpipe -- produced a 
wide range of different sounds from a breathy whisper in which pitch was almost 
indiscernible to loud reedy blasts executed with such force that wind blew the 
players' bangs into the air. Puna, Tintaya and Villanueva huffed and puffed on 
the antaras, along with other various recorders and flutes, deftly exchanging 
notes of a melody (much like a hocket) and punctuating with scattered 
vocalizing and beating on a drum called the bombo. 
</P>
<P>
Laura fluidly provided virtuosic pluckings on his charango, a 10-string 
mandolin-like instrument made from an armadillo shell. Cordero accompanied on 
guitar with appropriate strums and passages idiomatic to Latin folk music. 
</P>
<P>
The only glaring shortcoming of the evening was in programing. Rumillajta's 
tuneful, rhythmic music, indeed accessible to the ethno-pop world, was 
awkwardly paired with Brazilian pop crooner-guitarist Dori Caymmi. 
</P>
<P>
Caymmi's headlined part of the program, broadcast live over jazz radio station 
KKGO, contained little that matched the originality or virtuosity of 
Rumillajta. Backed up by a rock quartet, Caymmi hoarsely but sincerely sang a 
collection of original songs, all in an innocuous, middle-of-the-road pop 
style. GREGG WAGER

CAST CHANGES IN 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two young principals brought an exciting new sense of involvement to the Kirov 
Ballet production of "The Sleeping Beauty" Sunday afternoon at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
In physique, 22-year-old Zhanna Ayupova may be more womanly than girlish, but 
she danced Princess Aurora with great freshness, sweetness and a rapt wonder at 
every happy surprise in the fairy-tale plot. 
</P>
<P>
Free and spontaneous in phrasing, she faltered momentarily during the 
treacherous supported balances of the Rose Adagio but otherwise successfully 
met the technical challenges of the role. And she sustained an emotional 
rapport with her prince that helped camouflage many of the miscalculations in 
the staging. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite Ayupova, 25-year-old Farukh Ruzimatov danced with a disarming blend of 
bold, pristine classical technique and soulful Romantic intensity. Slender, 
dark-skinned, exotic -- a firebrand from Tashkent nicknamed "Razzmatazz" by his 
English-speaking fans -- Ruzimatov managed to make the Vision Scene seem a 
private revelation, "seeing" the corps dancers in his own mind before he ever 
turned to look in their direction. 
</P>
<P>
His distinctive melancholy complemented Ayupova's sunniness perfectly and they 
danced together in the last act with faultless surety -- his sharply etched 
jumps matching her perfectly placed turns. Incidentally, the Kirov program 
booklet says that Ruzimatov danced on the 1986 American tour, but don't believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
As the Lilac Fairy, veteran principal Galina Mezentseva (the opening-night 
Aurora in this engagement) offered brittle, small-scale dancing and exuded a 
kind of impassive graciousness. Nevertheless, her authority helped the 
character represent a plausible counterforce to Carabosse -- no easy task with 
all the cuts in storytelling pantomime that largely "abstract" the role. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the dainty, refined dancing of childlike Veronika Ivanova as 
Florine, and the appearance of Evgeny Neff (the opening- and second-night 
prince) as one of the suitors in the Rose Adagio, the rest of the Sunday 
matinee cast proved wholly familiar. Dzhemal Dalgat again conducted. LEWIS

POST-MODERNISM AT SECURITY PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Post-Modernism is to art as oat bran is to nutrition; the current wisdom is 
that it never hurts to toss a little in. Thus does "Configurations," a wildly 
divergent exhibition at Security Pacific Plaza, come to ask the question: When 
is a portrait a portrait, and when is it a Post-Modern metaphor? 
</P>
<P>
Illustrating a wide range of approaches to the human figure as seen in work by 
nine California artists (eight from Los Angeles), the show, which runs to Sept. 
16, raises a few vaguely substantiated points about the present state of the 
human form in art and makes a halfhearted attempt at aligning itself with the 
Post-Modern camp. It doesn't quite wash, however; much of this show, which was 
curated by Mark Johnstone, is simply too quirky, personal and sincere to pass 
itself off as P.M. 
</P>
<P>
A well-written catalogue essay by Ruth Weisberg makes a case (owing much to 
Roland Barthes) that these artists are Post-Modernists in that they favor "a 
disavowal of the direct experience of the figure," but that's not entirely 
true. While some of them do employ the figure as an anonymous archetype, others 
give it a highly specific and personal reading. 
</P>
<P>
Straddling both camps are Dan McCleary, Mark Stock and Leo Robinson, 
traditional painters whose work has the intellectual detachment of allegory and 
the peculiarity and intensity of real life. Stock is the most accessible of the 
three -- his luminous paintings invite us into a cool, tastefully wealthy 
milieu that's highly seductive. Painting men for the most part, Stock focuses 
on people whose station in life is at odds with their clothing. Orchestra 
musicians, butlers -- we see them in white tie and tails, looking as though 
they had just stepped out of "The Great Gatsby," yet they are powerless 
players. The sense of powerlessness and emotional repression that informs 
Stock's work is certainly Post-Modern. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McCleary paints in a flat, iconic style that mixes equal parts Alex Katz, 
Edward Hopper and David Hockney, and like work by Hockney, his portraits -- of 
a sleeping couple, a shirtless man being escorted into a police station, 
employees in fast-food restaurants -- are strangely drained and enervated. Leo 
Robinson shows impressionistic seascapes punctuated with human figures dwarfed 
by the vast settings that surround them. It's next to impossible to get the 
scent of kitsch off a seascape, and while Robinson pulls it off in two of five 
canvases here, the remaining three are a bit treacly and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Four artists use recorded history as a point of departure, with Rudy Mercado 
making the most of the approach. Reenacting the battle of Waterloo in eight 
stages, his "Episode From Waterloo" is a living diorama that changes every week 
as the battle progresses. The 1,100 figures and 500 horses that Mercado moves 
around his miniature set (he comes in every Friday night and repositions them) 
look like lead soldiers; in fact, they're made of soft clay that allows them to 
be reshaped. More and more of the figures strike the pose of corpses as the 
battle limps to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Somers bases his latex and resin paintings on frieze motifs lifted from 
the art of ancient Greece, while Antoinette Geldun takes the Last Supper as the 
inspiration for one of her three mixed-media installations. Combining a video 
montage of supper-table scenes from various movies, religious objects and a 
large color photograph of a family gathered around a kitchen table laden with a 
ghastly combination of foodstuffs, "Rituals: The Last Supper" takes shots at 
both Catholicism and the ritual of meal time. 
</P>
<P>
Geldun looks to her own personal history for "Rituals: Baptism," which deals 
both with the tragic deaths of several of her family members and the eternal 
life of the photographic image, while Carolyn Reynolds' shaped steel figures 
based on kachina dolls explore the Indian mythology of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Also including work by Chris Kidd and Laura Schatzkin, "Configurations" is 
ultimately an ambiguous potpourri open to any interpretation, Post-Modern or 
otherwise, that one cares to give it.

BAJA '88 SET PLEASES THE BRUNCH BUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following on the heels of the Tijuana Brass in 1964, the Baja Marimba Band 
enjoyed several years of pop success with its jazz-tinged Latin music, its soft 
and mellow sounds of two marimbas contrasted by a chorus of crisp-sounding 
brass instruments. Sunday morning, at the weekly jazz brunch at Windows on 
Hollywood atop the Holiday Inn Hollywood, Baja '88, minus the brass, made its 
debut courtesy of the Los Angeles Jazz Society. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for a couple of nights in San Francisco in January, we've been a garage 
band," said leader-marimbist Julius Wechter, adding that a schedule of 
rehearsals has been maintained for "fun." 
</P>
<P>
That spirit of fun was pervasive during a pair of short sets Baja '88, now a 
quintet, offered to the midday diners. Quality music matched the fun. 
</P>
<P>
The marimba, a once-popular mallet-percussion instrument whose stature was 
usurped by its metallic cousin, the vibraphone, was given its due by Wechter 
and cohort Julie Greenberg, introduced by Wechter as the world's "second-best 
marimba player." Fine players both, Wechter and Greenberg each soloed expertly, 
their similar styles blending to lushly sonorous effect in a series of 
delightful tunes. 
</P>
<P>
For melodic contrast was the handsome guitar sound of Jim Fox, his cleanly 
picked lines providing balance and interest. His solo rendition of "There Is No 
Greater Love" was a delight. Bassist Richard Maloof capably anchored the 
group's harmonic structure (he soloed neatly on "Free Fall") while the deft, 
tasteful drumming of Mike Stephans provided the compelling rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
Without programmatic intent, Baja '88 created perfect morning music. Though 
"Stale Air" was a highly energetic inclusion in the second set, most of the 
music was offered in a more mellow context. "Baja Noces" and "Free Fall," while 
both up-tempo, maintained that flavor with their gently wafting melodies 
presented by the dark-sounding marimbas. "Lazy Day," a beautiful ballad by 
Greenberg, had the group at its best. A. JAMES LISKA

DUFFY TOUCHES OFF A ROYAL DISPUTE BY BOYCOTTING VISTA JAIL CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A routine dedication ceremony for the newly expanded County Jail in Vista 
triggered a political spat Monday when Sheriff John Duffy, calling Supervisor 
Susan Golding "her royal highness," refused to participate or provide 
refreshments for an event he called "foolish, petty and a waste of taxpayer 
dollars and county time." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the county's chief administrative officer, Duffy noted that he 
already hosted an opening ceremony last month. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that Her Royal Highness is miffed at missing an additional photo 
opportunity or chance to drop a quotable quote for the media. Well, too bad, 
but we don't intend to waste our time and money," stated Duffy's letter, which 
also was sent to the local media. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth District Supervisor John MacDonald, in whose district the jail is 
situated, said of Duffy's letter, "I thought it was childish and 
unprofessional. . . . This really exemplifies the division between the Board of 
Supervisors and Sheriff Duffy. We should be working as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Asked Monday morning whether county officials intend to proceed without the 
sheriff's blessing, county spokesman Bob Lerner said, "I don't see why not. 
It's our jail." Lerner added that he considers Duffy's action "nothing short of 
bizarre" and said there would be no official county response to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
True to the sheriff's order, employees of jail and the adjacent sheriff's 
station boycotted Monday afternoon's brief ceremony in the jail's parking lot. 
Instead, they watched from behind the jail's tinted windows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details of Letter From Duffy 
</P>
<P>
Part of Duffy's objection to the ceremony was based on his belief that jail 
personnel had been asked to provide refreshments and tours, which Lerner 
denied. In the letter, Duffy stated: "You and the Board can do whatever you 
want outside, but there will be no public or press tours of the jail because I 
don't want our operations disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
The letter continued: "Of course, we can accommodate any supervisor who wants 
to tour any jail at any time. It would be helpful if they spent more time 
learning about jail conditions that adversely affect public safety, our 
employees and the inmates, instead of grandstanding for the media." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department Lt. Liz Foster said Duffy's reaction was prompted by a 
July 19 memo from Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey, in which Hickey 
told Duffy that all future dedication ceremonies at county facilities will be 
organized by the county administrative officer and cleared through the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy apparently took Hickey's memo personally, interpreting it to be a slap on 
the hand for organizing the initial jail-dedication ceremony on his own, Foster 
said, adding, "He's sure it's a result of certain board members not being 
present at the last dedication and missing out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Written at Golding's Behest? 
</P>
<P>
Foster also said unnamed sources indicated that Hickey wrote the memo at the 
direction of Susan Golding. "The memo was basically another attempt by the 
county supervisors to dictate the moves of an elected official," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Golding, before Monday's ceremony, said she had no knowledge of any such memo 
sent from Hickey's office to the sheriff and had not requested that it be 
written. Hickey was in the hospital Monday recovering from back surgery and was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said the dedication ceremony had been organized by the county 
administrator's office and was standard procedure for any county-funded 
project. "The members of this board have worked very hard to do whatever we 
could to build the jail facilities," she said. "It's really a shame (Duffy) 
could possibly ruin this." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Duffy's characterization of her as "Her Royal Highness," Golding 
shrugged and said, "It's better than some other names." 
</P>
<P>
Several of those present at the ceremony called for happier relations among the 
branches of local government, and some suggested that the jail project might 
have gone smoother with Duffy's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're All in This Together' 
</P>
<P>
"We're all in this together, and we need to work together to find an answer," 
said 1st District Supervisor Brian Bilbray. San Diego Superior Court Presiding 
Judge Michael Greer said the county board of supervisors, the county 
administrator's office and the court system had forged a "tremendous" team to 
get the jail completed, but added that "something's missing in the teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
Greer indicated that the empty jail looming behind him was not yet occupied by 
inmates only because lack of teamwork on the part of the Sheriff's Department 
had caused a shortage of trained personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. James Marmack disputed Greer's remarks, saying the entire jail opening 
had been delayed two months because of many small, unavoidable construction 
delays, not because of any lack of readiness on the part of the Sheriff's 
Department. "Even if I had additional staff here today, we couldn't be any 
further along," Marmack said.

MOTHER OF BABY SHAMU DIES AFTER COLLISION IN SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kandu, a killer whale who gave birth last year at Sea World, died Monday after 
a collision with another female whale during a show at the marine park. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials issued a terse statement saying the 14-year-old Kandu died 
after a "physical interaction" with "Corky" during the 4 p.m. killer whale 
show. Sea World officials refused to provide any other information about the 
circumstances of the killer whale's death. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting versions of when the collision occurred. Some witnesses 
said the whales collided in the performing area of the 5-million-gallon tank 
while moving at high speeds. Others said it must have happened when the whales 
were in a holding area behind the main pool or in a tunnel connecting the pen 
with the main pool. 
</P>
<P>
Kandu weighs about 6,000 pounds, Corky weighs about 8,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ignored Commands' 
</P>
<P>
Ed Maley and Ruth Jacobsen, who are vacationing from New Jersey and witnessed 
the incident, said that, during the second part of the whale show, the two 
females and the baby were in the main pool performing. Maley said the collision 
must have occurred under water, where it was not visible to the audience. The 
two females then began circling the pool at high speed "for no apparent reason" 
and ignored the trainers' commands. 
</P>
<P>
Maley said that, at one point, Kandu broke away and approached a male whale, 
who was locked in a separate holding pen, for a few seconds before she began 
circling the pool again. When she began circling the pool a second time, Maley 
noticed the blood. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just a little bit of blood. It was all over the place. It dirtied 
the whole pool. At one point, you just knew she was going to die," said Maley. 
</P>
<P>
The bleeding whale swam toward the enclosure where Baby Shamu is kept and 
disappeared from sight, Jacobsen said. Park officials said that Baby Shamu was 
not involved in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like there was nothing they could do," said Jacobsen. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand people saw the 
</P>
<P>
injuries and were escorted from the stadium after an abbreviated show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very obvious to you, as it is to us, that (Kandu) is bleeding," an 
announcer at Shamu Stadium said. "We're not really sure what happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blood Was Really Bad' 
</P>
<P>
According to an Associated Press report, Jim Barnes -- who brought his family 
from Stansbury Park, Utah, to visit Sea World while vacationing in San Diego -- 
said, "They enticed (Kandu) back to the holding pen and brought the other 
female adult into the show pen and completed part of the show. Then they got 
the mother whale into about 6 inches of water -- the baby was lying right there 
next to her -- and the blood was really bad." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Deeble, a Greenpeace whale expert from Seattle, said, "This is the first 
death of its kind involving killer whales that I know of. A (killer whale) in 
captivity is like keeping an eagle in a parakeet cage. In this case, they put 
two eagles in a parakeet cage." 
</P>
<P>
Deeble said that Greenpeace, an environmental group, was told that Corky and 
Kandu have been rivals for female dominance in the Sea World killer-whale 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
Corky, who was performing under the name of Shamu, is about 25 years old and 
was purchased from Marineland, near Los Angeles, about three years ago. Orky, a 
male killer whale, was purchased from Marineland at the same time and died last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Kandu gave birth to a whale calf during a performance. The baby 
was named "Baby Shamu" and was sired by Orky, who died three days after the 
baby whale was born. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials said they do not believe that Kandu's death will have a 
serious effect on Baby Shamu. According to officials, the baby is eating 40 to 
45 pounds of solid food each day and "is sufficiently independent at this 
time." Kandu and Baby Shamu were featured in television commercials that aired 
throughout Southern California promoting the park. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Sea World said that more information about the circumstances 
surrounding the whale's death will be released today.Plans are under way for 
Sea World veterinarians to perform a necropsy to determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Incident 
</P>
<P>
It was the second incident in two years in which killer whales at the park have 
fought with each other, according to two people who witnessed an earlier 
confrontation. John Fitzrandolph, a San Diego junior high school teacher, and 
Deborah York, a San Luis Obispo reporter, said that, in June, 1987, they 
witnessed a bloody confrontation between two whales in the same tank. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzrandolph said he saw a 2 1/2-foot gash on one whale's left underbelly, 
which was bleeding. On Monday, Sea World officials refused to comment on the 
purported 1987 incident. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World has been plagued with problems involving its killer whales over the 
past two years. In November, 1987, trainers were pulled from the water after a 
number of trainers were injured over an eight-month period while performing 
with the animals. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious incident involved trainer John Sillick, who was crushed when 
one whale landed on top of him while he was riding another. Sillick suffered a 
broken pelvis, femur and ribs.

BURGLARS FIND FODDER FOR FRAUD IN CARS AT BEACHES

It cost JoLynn Nyquist $8,000 to go jogging at Torrey Pines State Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down to Torrey Pines beach to go jogging after work," said Nyquist, a 
25-year-old nurse who moved to California from Montana seven months ago. "When 
I got back, I found they had smashed my back window, taken my purse from my 
trunk and emptied my glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
"Back home, we don't even lock our doors," she said. "I guess it's my welcome 
to California." 
</P>
<P>
Nyquist is one of dozens of victims of a summer burglary ring that has stolen 
women's purses out of cars at beaches from Del Mar to Mission Bay since July 4, 
according to authorities who have uncovered the operation and made eight 
arrests so far. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than 40 Cars 
</P>
<P>
The thieves, working in roving man-woman teams, broke into more than 40 cars 
parked in lots or along roads near such popular beaches as Fiesta Island, Sea 
World and Torrey Pines State Reserve, sheriff's deputies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves netted more than $100,000 in cash and stolen merchandise through 
the illegal use of checkbooks and credit cards, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Nyquist, who lost her credit cards and checkbook, has since heard from stores 
at which the thieves apparently spent her money. Detectives said as much as 
$8,000 was illegally charged to her credit and checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard from airline companies, grocery stores, a T.J. Maxx clothing store 
-- even a hair salon. I guess I should be glad they didn't take my car," 
Nyquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the woman in the burglary team, posing as a beach-goer, would 
walk through parking lots targeting cars, followed by the man, who was carrying 
a crowbar. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 98% of the victims were women who didn't give much thought as to how 
they hid their purse," sheriff's Detective Larry Van Wey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people lost pretty sizable of cash," he said. "But these 
</P>
<P>
people were primarily after checkbooks and credit cards they could use to go on 
major spending sprees around town. 
</P>
<P>
"So the losses in that regard could be more than $100,000 -- money spent in 
every conceivable kind of way, from plane tickets, car and hotel rentals, gas, 
stereos, VCRs and expensive jewelry -- even food binges at local grocery 
stores," Van Wey said. 
</P>
<P>
Several checks valued at between $500 and $1,000 each were cashed at stores in 
San Diego and East County, including at the Price Club and commercial 
check-cashing windows, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings Account Emptied 
</P>
<P>
In one case, deputies said, the thieves used a stolen credit card to withdraw 
all $5,000 from a 73-year-old woman's savings account, through the automatic 
teller machine at her bank. The woman had left her confidential identification 
number in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities suspect that more than a dozen people will eventually be implicated 
in the ring, which they said began operating shortly after the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people we've arrested or are looking at all have been on parole" 
in connection with other thefts, Van Wey said, adding that all are residents of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, San Diego police, who are handling the fraud elements of the case, 
arrested three men who had allegedly checked into the Radisson Hotel in Mission 
Valley using a stolen credit card pilfered weeks before from a car belonging to 
a North County beach-goer. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, authorities had arrested what they described as two man-woman teams at 
beaches in Del Mar. Timothy McIver and his wife, Carole, were arrested July 19 
on charges of second-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools. 
Undercover detectives arrested a second pair Aug. 9 in Del Mar. Richard Lee 
McDowell, 35, and Sheila Coleman, 22, were charged with several 
burglary-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gas Station Videos 
</P>
<P>
Several days earlier, 42-year-old Denny Nobles was arrested while driving a 
rental car that had been secured with a stolen credit card, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have also identified a pregnant woman believed to have been 
involved with the ring and are looking for several other people, identified 
from gas station video cameras that recorded their illegal credit card 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies uncovered the ring with the help of eyewitness descriptions of the 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
"They would switch partners every now and then," Van Wey said. "The male would 
drop the female off, and she would peer into parked cars as she walked past 
with a towel, looking like they were going to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Each pair committed two or three burglaries at a time before heading home to 
the North Park area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back Window Smashed 
</P>
<P>
Van Wey, who worked undercover with the Sheriff's Department beach patrol unit 
to make several of the arrests, said he was surprised at the carelessness of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the number of people who put their keys in the gas cap, 
or they hid them under the bumper or left them on top of the tire," he said. 
"And I'm not talking about junkers, I'm talking about Porsches and Ferraris. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just there for a couple of hours," he said, "and, if I was a car thief, 
I could have driven off five or 10 cars." 
</P>
<P>
His advice: "When you go to the beach, carry a small wallet or a rump sack with 
you, just to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't assume that just because you put something in your trunk that it's going 
to be there when you get back."

JAPANESE BEEF FEEDLOT IS TOLD TO STOP POLLUTING; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGER CALLS WATER BOARD ORDER UNREALISTIC, SAYS COWS NOT POTTY-TRAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Regional Water Quality Control Board on Monday ordered a Japanese feedlot 
to stop polluting the isolated San Diego County valley north of Warner Springs, 
but delayed imposing a possible $300,000 fine against American First Beef. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Winne, general manager of American First Beef, said the order is 
unrealistic because the 1,000 or so cattle in the Paradise Valley feedlot 
aren't potty-trained. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect me to go running around with a bucket," Winne said, asking 
the board members to amend the order prohibiting "any discharge of waste on 
land or water" from the American First Beef feedlot in the north-central part 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Are Not Harming Anyone' 
</P>
<P>
Winne insisted that no runoff or pollution is leaving the feedlot property, 
"and we are not harming anyone. We are asking you to modify these reports so 
that we can all live with them." 
</P>
<P>
The water board has found no evidence of actual pollution, but the panel ruled 
that manure from the feedlot could pollute Paradise Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Water board staff confirmed that the order, under state regulations, prohibits 
any discharge onto the feedlot grounds, including manure and urine, effectively 
forcing American First Beef to shut down its cattle-feeding operation or be in 
violation of the board's order. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is no small one. A 1,000-pound animal will produce 44 pounds of 
manure and 18 pounds of urine daily, according to a staff report. At that rate, 
a 1,150-head herd would discharge 71,300 pounds of waste daily. 
</P>
<P>
"This amount of waste discharged to land daily constitutes a potential threat 
to local ground and surface water," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Board chairman John Foley conceded that "I don't think cows can read waste 
discharge requirements." He recommended that "practical" regulations be 
established to allow the Japanese firm to conform under strict monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of going that route, board members persuaded Foley to drop his proposal 
and, in effect, allow the feedlot to operate in non-conformance by looking the 
other way, a condition that dozens of dairies, sewage plants and other 
polluters find themselves in. Foley labeled that "a state of non-grace." 
</P>
<P>
The board also refused to approve a $300,000 fine recommended by Ladin Delaney, 
executive officer of the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The proposed 
fine was for failure to obtain a waste-discharge permit, failure to complete an 
environmental impact report and failure to meet other requirements before 
starting up the feedlot last fall. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting in a closed-door session, the water board voted to delay imposing 
any fine against the Japanese firm, calling the action "premature." 
</P>
<P>
Under the California Water Code, the maximum civil penalty is $10,000 a day, or 
$570,000 for the 57-day period covered by the order. 
</P>
<P>
Water board staff member David Barber had proposed an amended fine of $50,000 
with the remaining $250,000 to be levied in $62,500 increments if American 
First Beef does not meet a schedule for improving its property and guaranteeing 
against pollution of ground or surface waters. 
</P>
<P>
But board members decided instead to warn American First Beef to speed its 
environmental studies and obtain a permit. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese investors purchased the Paradise Valley property and built an 
Escondido packing house in preparation for the relaxation of Japanese tariffs 
and quotas against beef imports, scheduled in 1991 under a U.S.-Japanese trade 
agreement. The firm plans to raise high-quality beef, butcher it and export it 
to Japan, where it now brings prices of more than $100 a pound.

BORDER PATROL VEHICLE KILLS BOY, 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy was killed early Sunday when he was run over by a U.S. Border 
Patrol vehicle along the Mexican border less than a mile west of the port of 
entry at San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Eduardo Hernandez Hernandez, a native of the Mexican state of Jalisco, 
died about 2:10 a.m. Sunday, according to Deputy Coroner Penne Hammerstead. 
</P>
<P>
Michael D. Gregg, a Border Patrol supervisor in San Diego, called the incident 
a "regrettable and unfortunate accident." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez, a San Diego-based rights activist and prominent critic of the 
Border Patrol's tactics, called it an example of the agency's "total disregard 
for human life." In the past four years, Martinez said, patrol vehicles have 
injured at least seven migrants in the California border area, several of whom 
have died. He said the agents drive in a reckless fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"This has to stop," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg dismissed those comments as ill-informed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, the agents simply cannot see these people," said Gregg, who added 
that San Diego police are investigating the latest accident. "It's very 
unfortunate, but things like this do happen." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to identify the agent who was driving the four-wheel-drive vehicle. 
The agent was experienced and accompanied by a partner, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in the early-morning darkness along the southern flank of 
the Tijuana River's southern levee, a flood-control structure that has become 
perhaps the most-frequented illicit crossing spot along the almost 
2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Almost nightly, hundreds of undocumented migrants line the porous border fence 
along the base of the elevated levee, waiting for a letup in the guard of 
agents posted in vans and assorted all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg and the coroner's office provided the following account of Sunday's 
incident: 
</P>
<P>
The boy was with a group of about 100 people, including his 15-year-old brother 
Angel, who were crossing into the United States about three-quarters of a mile 
west of the legal entry point at San Ysidro. The group had gathered atop the 
levee, which is perhaps 20 yards inside U.S. territory at that point. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 a.m, an agent descended from his post atop the levee and began to drive 
westward along the levee's base, with the intention of deterring the group's 
move into the United States. The vehicle, whose headlights were on, was 
traveling at 10 to 15 m.p.h. Gregg emphasized that the agent was not chasing 
anyone at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Spotting the vehicle, most of the group decided to head back to the tattered 
fence that signals the beginning of Mexican territory. The boy, however, 
arrived late and stumbled into the way at a spot just a few feet north of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
"He literally fell into the path of the Blazer," Gregg said. "The agent had no 
time to react." 
</P>
<P>
First aid was administered, he said, but the boy died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said the boy and his brother were being smuggled to the Los Angeles area, 
where their father was waiting for them.

The Los Angeles City Board of Public Works gave city planners the go-ahead 
Monday to review an application for expanding Lopez Canyon Landfill, which is 
strongly opposed by the dump's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
As the only city-operated dump, Lopez Canyon receives two-thirds of the 6,000 
tons of residential trash produced in the city daily. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-0 vote, the board directed the city Planning Department to proceed with 
its consideration of the city Bureau of Sanitation's application to nearly 
double the size and capacity of the northeast San Fernando Valley dump and keep 
it open through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
The board's action was only a small step in attempts to increase the dump's 
capacity. There was no public protest. But by the time the proposal reaches the 
city Planning Commission in mid-September it promises to be highly 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protests by Residents 
</P>
<P>
The mere mention of expansion plans a year ago touched off protests ranging 
from letter-writing campaigns to sit-ins by residents of the communities 
nearest the dump: Lake View Terrace, Kagel Canyon and Pacoima. They say the 
city should stick to its original plans to close the dump in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Councilmen Ernani Bernardi, Joel Wachs and Nate Holden have supported 
the residents in council discussions about the dump. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report on the proposal has drawn public criticism for 
being too vague and too long. Bernardi and Wachs plan to resurrect a proposal 
at today's council meeting that the public comment period for the environmental 
report be extended two more months to give opponents more time to study it. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion permit review will proceed simultaneously with an environmental 
review of the proposal and will include public hearings, said Gordon Clint, 
assistant secretary to the city board. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Sanitation is seeking permission to increase the amount of trash 
dumped from 4,000 to 7,200 tons a day, to allow the height of garbage mounds to 
rise from 1,760 to 1,800 feet and to continue use of seven acres of U.S. Forest 
Service land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
June Order 
</P>
<P>
An order by the state Waste Management Board issued in June calls for 
reductions in height and daily volume and a halt to dumping on the Forest 
Service parcel. The city is challenging that order in Los Angeles Superior 
Court.

OFFICIALS CITE MAJOR TIE-UP IN CALL FOR ROADS 
</P>

A single truck accident that paralyzed traffic in the Santa Clarita Valley for 
six hours last weekend is frustrating proof of the need to improve the valley's 
fragile and inefficient road network, said authorities reviewing the incident 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It points out we have a serious problem," said Santa Clarita City Manager 
George Caravalho, who heads Santa Clarita's disaster-preparedness committee. 
"It had major impact on just about all major streets." 
</P>
<P>
City officials also called for an explanation of the delays in cleaning up the 
accident, which closed the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Mayor Jan Heidt, the city will prepare a report explaining 
the delays, Caravalho said. The spill occurred about 7 a.m. Saturday but was 
not cleaned up until after 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation and law-enforcement officials said Monday that the delays were 
caused by an unexpected complication during cleanup and by plain old bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
The problem started when a tanker carrying nearly 8,000 gallons of liquefied 
propane gas overturned on the San Fernando Road off-ramp to the southbound 
freeway. Officials first closed only the off-ramp as they waited for Hurt's 
Transportation, owner of the truck, to bring in another vehicle to siphon off 
the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The situation grew hazardous at about 1 p.m., when work crews discovered that 
the tanker was leaking. Firefighters, fearing an explosion, closed the freeway 
in both directions, as well as Sierra Highway, the only major parallel artery. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Caltrans procedures, the agency began calling independent 
contractors qualified to handle the situation, said Patricia Reid, a 
spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
It took Caltrans a few hours to find a company available for the job, Reid 
said. The company was Environmental Waste Technology of Corona, 70 miles away. 
Bob Eickhoff, company president, said Caltrans did not reach his firm until 3 
p.m. His work crews reached the scene shortly after 4 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Caltrans was scrambling to find a cleanup firm, thousands of motorists 
were trapped in traffic. A 20-minute trip across town took more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Klajic said it took two hours to drive from The Old Road, just west of the 
Golden State Freeway, to Canyon Country. The roads were packed. "I couldn't 
even get into a parking lot," she said. As her car crept up Valencia Boulevard, 
Klajic thought she would stop at a nearby Bob's Big Boy to wait out the jam. 
Dozens of other motorists had the same idea and filled the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"We did excellent business," said waiter Keith Rostalski. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said a comparable accident would have had minimal 
impact in the San Fernando Valley, where a grid of streets provides motorists 
plenty of alternative routes. But in Santa Clarita, said CHP Officer Ralph 
Elvira, "there were no emergency access roads." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley isn't so much a valley as a collection of steep 
canyons. Transportation planners have likened the highway system to the 
outstretched fingers of a hand. To get from one finger to another, one must go 
through the palm. There are no direct routes linking one finger with another. 
</P>
<P>
With the Antelope Valley Freeway closed, motorists traveling east to Canyon 
Country had to drive northwest up the Golden State Freeway and then inch their 
way across town. Caltrans crews directed drivers away from the freeway only to 
discover that "there was no real good secondary route through the area," Reid 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Tony Welch said deputies directed traffic at 
most major intersections. A department helicopter was dispatched to spot the 
intersections needing the most assistance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, proponents of a road-tax initiative to raise up to $275 million to 
improve and build roads said they would use the traffic jam to aid their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this was a very visible demonstration of why we need these roads," 
said Lou Garasi, a member of a joint-powers authority involving the city and 
Los Angeles County that is sponsoring the initiative. While the roads to be 
funded by the initiative would not prevent a massive traffic jam, they would at 
least reduce the congestion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi said he fears that the valley's road system would hinder traffic during 
a major earthquake. "Can you imagine if we had a serious calamity?" he asked.

COUNCIL TIGHTENS LAW ON PAPER RACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando City Council voted unanimously Monday to strengthen an 
ordinance prohibiting owners of newspaper street racks from allowing the 
display of sexually explicit photographs and headlines. 
</P>
<P>
The council added to a previous ordinance a lengthy list of sexual activities 
to be banned from depiction in photos or headlines visible in news racks. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also restricts to eight the number of newspaper racks that can be 
placed within a 200-foot radius. Under the ordinance, vendors also will be 
responsible for keeping their racks free of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance provides that racks which violate the ordinance can be impounded 
and held until the owner pays a $100 fee.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN CHARGED WITH CRUELTY TO ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men who authorities said were operating an illegal rodeo in Saugus were 
charged Monday with felony cruelty to animals, the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Aranda, 33, who operated the rodeo on Sundays at a ranch in San 
Francisquito Canyon, and Aucencio Guerrero, 38, a caretaker at the ranch, were 
charged with one count of animal cruelty, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela 
Davis-Springer. 
</P>
<P>
The rodeo was closed by sheriff's deputies July 23 after they discovered it 
while investigating complaints about cars parked in the area, officials said. 
About 200 participants and spectators were dispersed by deputies. Neighbors 
said the Mexican-style rodeo had been taking place at the ranch on Sundays for 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
Aranda was cited for violating county codes by operating the rodeo without 
proper permits. County animal control officers also conducted an investigation 
after deputies noticed that several horses used in the rodeo had open wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The wounds were consistent with abuse," Davis-Springer said. She said the 
horses had untended wounds on their mouths, backs and sides. 
</P>
<P>
Aranda and Guerrero are scheduled to be arraigned today in Newhall Municipal 
Court. If convicted, each man could face up to three years in prison, 
Davis-Springer said.

SANTIAGO SAYS IT'S TIME FOR A TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
ANGRY CATCHER LEADS THE PADRES' 8-2 VICTORY OVER THE PHILLIES

<P>
Padre catcher Benito Santiago, asserting that his patience has been exhausted, 
said Monday night that he should be traded as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to leave San Diego, but the way it looks," Santiago said, "it'd 
be better for me, better for the manager (Jack McKeon), better for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick and tired of seeing my name in the papers being traded. Just do it, 
and get it over with, because I can't play like this. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's not good to keep talking, to run my mouth. But I've got to be 
honest. I've got to say how I feel. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't think they've been fair to me." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon had trade talks involving Santiago again Monday afternoon, meeting with 
Philadelphia Phillie General Manager Lee Thomas for about 20 minutes in 
McKeon's office at Veterans Stadium. They discussed several possibilities, 
including swapping Santiago for outfielder Von Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides left the meeting convinced that it's highly unlikely that a trade 
could be consummated before the end of the season, but sources say that both 
clubs will continue talks in hopes of completing a trade in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's going to get done now," McKeon said. "There won't be any trades 
until the season is over." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who hit a home run and had his 13th pickoff of the season in the 
Padres' 8-2 victory over the Phillies in front of 17,467 at Veterans Stadium, 
has long been coveted by Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies' catching corps consists of 27-year-old Darren Daulton (.191, 
eight homers and 36 RBIs) and 32-year-old Steve Lake (.255, two homers and 14 
RBIs), who are struggling as much defensively as offensively. Santiago, 
meanwhile, was voted as the 1989 All-Star catcher and earned a Gold Glove last 
season. He's hitting .240 with seven homers and 42 RBIs in 97 games, having 
thrown out 44% of those attempting to steal. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who are making Santiago expendable because of the play of triple-A 
catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. in Las Vegas, have been searching the past couple of 
months for a starting center fielder, and preferably one who could bat leadoff. 
They're convinced that Hayes would fit the billing. A left-handed hitter who 
can also play right field and first base, Hayes is hitting .253 for the 
Phillies this season with 18 home runs and 59 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"We never were going to trade him to start with," McKeon said, referring to a 
year ago, "and I told him that. If we had made a trade with one of our catchers 
before, it probably would have been Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's a question of, 'What's the most you can get.' 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't get something for them, why give them away? You still end up to 
be in better position a year for now. Who knows, maybe I'll bring them both to 
camp with me next year. It might make them mad, but that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
"And if it comes to that scenario, it's going to come down to whoever does the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Although Santiago is considered to have the best arm of any catcher in the big 
leagues, his defensive skills have concerned the Padres. He leads all catchers 
with 17 errors and 11 passed balls. There also has been a marked difference in 
performances of some pitchers when backup catcher Mark Parent has been behind 
the plate instead of Santiago, particularly with Bruce Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
When Parent is behind the plate, Hurst is 5-2 with a 1.91 ERA this season with 
two nine-inning no-decisions. Hurst is 7-7 with a 3.65 ERA when Santiago has 
started. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon shrugs it off as a coincidence, and to prove his point, said that he'll 
start Santiago tonight with Hurst on the mound. Santiago, who has not started 
since Aug. 2 when Hurst has pitched, said, "I'll believe it when I see that 
lineup card, but not until then. 
</P>
<P>
"They can do whatever they want. They have all year anyway. If they don't want 
to explain thing to me, that's fine. I never know if I'm playing or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just tired of all this. If I'm doing wrong, take me out of here. If I'm 
doing good, leave me in there." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, the 1987 rookie of the year, has started in 91 of the Padres' 125 
games this season. Parent has started 34. Although McKeon says that the extra 
time off will extend Santiago's career by two or three years, Santiago claims 
that the extra rest is ruining his season. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to keep playing," Santiago said. "I don't want to keep sitting out. The 
way it is now, it's two days on, two days off. Three days on, three days off. I 
can't play that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'd be playing a lot better, putting up some better numbers. One day 
(last Wednesday) I got two hits -- and I don't get two hits for a long time -- 
and they get me out of there the next day. Just when I'm going good, they take 
me out. What do you expect? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they're playing these games with me. I'm not a computer, man. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to trade me, trade me, let me know. You know, I've tried to 
put it out of my mind, but I can't. I can't play like this with everything 
going on. I've got all this pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to play one guy, if they're going to play Alomar, just do it. 
Get it over with. 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't keep doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who is earning $325,000 this season and is eligible for arbitration 
for the first time this off-season, also believes he's being penalized by 
batting eighth in the lineup. He has hit eighth 14 times this season, hitting 
.244 with four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to put up some good numbers, but how can I put any numbers batting 
there," he said. "Tell me anyone else batting eighth who's got numbers that I 
have. 
</P>
<P>
"They think they do me big favors? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen pitched his first complete game of the season, a six-hitter, 
raising his record to 6-9. "I guess everyone thinks it's a big surprise that I 
pitched a complete game," he said. "Or that I gave up just two runs? Hey, 
you're supposed to win games in which you get two hits." . . . The Padres got a 
season-high seven extra-base hits, including a double by Rasmussen. "He just 
showed everybody up the way he hit tonight," Padre left fielder Bip Roberts 
said. "It was like he said, 'This is the way you do it.' I just said, 'Wow.' . 
. . Roberts was impressive himself, hitting a two-run home run in the second 
inning. "Just call him, 'Babe Roberts,' " McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillie outfielder John Kruk, who was traded with Randy Ready, by the Padres 
for outfielder Chris James, is hitting .356 since the June 2 trade. "I'm not 
going to say anything bad about Jack (McKeon)," said Kruk, "but they were 
picked to win, and look at the job he's done. But it really worked out well for 
me. If I was still there, I'd be sitting on the bench, I'd be hitting .150, and 
I'd be miserable." . . . The Phillies committed three wild pitches Monday, 
tying a franchise-record of 69 in a season set in 1962.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average may not have reached an all-time high as yet, 
but some San Diego stocks are continuing to make new highs week after week, 
said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the record-setters were Mail Boxes Etc., which rose to $30.75, up 50% in 
a month from the $20.50 closing price on July 17. The company has shown 
excellent earnings gains, but at its current price is selling for more than 30 
times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
First National Corp., which recently declared a 10% stock dividend, was up 
again, recorded a new high of $18.50. The bank has shown excellent earnings 
gains this year and is seeking acquisition candidates to become San Diego's 
largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
Other new highs were recorded by GTI at $5 and International Totalizator at 
$4.31. Both Great American Bank and HomeFed Corp., which have been frequently 
mentioned as acquisition or merger candidates because of their extensive branch 
systems in San Diego, gave up some of the recent gains. Great American was down 
$1, and HomeFed dropped $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Corp. of America scraped bottom, hitting an all-time low of $4 before 
closing the week at $4.125. 
</P>
<P>
Biomagnetic Technologies continued to drift down as the stock closed at $7, 
down $2 from last month's public offering price of $9. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic Corp., which gained $2.50 last week on the strength of its excellent 
earnings report, gave back $1.50 of that gain this week to close at $16.

HIGH HOPES FOR A HARD DISK DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TANDON PINS ITS BID FOR A COMEBACK ON A DEVICE TO MAKE ITS PCS STAND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casey Hughes, vice president of personal computer manufacturer Tandon Corp., 
yanked a hard disk drive from his computer and tossed it on his desk. To 
further emphasize his point, he dropped the data-storage device on the floor 
and allowed it to clatter dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes looked satisfied. "You can throw it on the floor and it'll still boot," 
or restart, he said. "That was something previously you would never do." 
</P>
<P>
Here lie Tandon's hopes for a comeback from severe problems that have plagued 
the company in recent years. Tandon, based in Moorpark, once was a successful 
producer of disk drives -- the units that house information in computers. But 
by the mid-1980s it had fallen victim to Japanese competitors and slumping 
computer sales, and it lost nearly $200 million in the 1985-86 fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
Since then it has been trying to make it in the personal computer market and is 
hawking the removable, portable disk drive as the feature that distinguishes it 
from other PC makers. Meanwhile, Tandon sold its data-storage business to 
Western Digital last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Changes 
</P>
<P>
It has been a rocky transition. The firm lost $19.9 million last year on sales 
of $309 million, and lost $11.9 million in the first six months of 1989. Its 
stock, which hit a peak of $34.25 a share in 1983, traded recently at 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
And there are signs that Tandon's rebound won't be easy. Competition is intense 
in the U.S. personal computer market, and the recent strength of the dollar has 
hurt the firm in Europe by making its products more expensive. Also, it remains 
a big question as to whether Tandon's removable disk drive will spur enough 
demand for its computers. 
</P>
<P>
Sirjang Lal Tandon, chairman and chief executive who founded the company in 
1975, is apparently undaunted. The Indian-born Tandon, known as Jugi, was out 
of town and unavailable for an interview. But Hughes said Tandon "takes his 
impact on the PC market seriously." 
</P>
<P>
At the height of his success in 1983, Tandon was listed by Forbes magazine as 
one of the nation's 400 richest individuals, with his 11% stake in Tandon Corp. 
worth an estimated $150 million. A flamboyant entrepreneur with a passion for 
collecting cars, he was quoted at the time as saying, "I've made more money 
than the next four generations will need to spend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remains in Control 
</P>
<P>
But with the collapse of Tandon's stock, Jugi Tandon's 7.3% stake in the 
company is worth only about $2.5 million. Nonetheless, he remains firmly in 
control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in Tandon is Jugi," said Hughes, who heads Tandon's U.S. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Jugi Tandon's impact on the PC market has yet to be felt to any major 
degree, at least in the United States. Nearly 90% of Tandon's sales are in 
Europe, where the firm established a base under the guidance of Chuck Peddle, a 
former Commodore International computer whiz. 
</P>
<P>
Peddle joined Tandon in 1986 as part of an impressive team of computer industry 
veterans, including former International Business Machine Corp. executives Dan 
H. Wilkie and H.L. (Sparky) Sparks, who were hired to make the company a 
successful PC manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Peddle, Wilkie and Sparks have all since left Tandon, and along with the 
departing executives went Tandon's profits. After two years of losses, the firm 
reported net income of $23 million in 1987. But last year's loss indicated that 
the bad times weren't over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Unreliable 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the company earned a reputation for unreliability by announcing and 
taking orders for products long before it was able to deliver them. "We had a 
year where we waved the banner of technology and didn't deliver it," Hughes 
admitted. "I shot myself in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
Peddle said Tandon can still become profitable. "We showed Tandon could be a 
profitable company," he said. "The market hasn't changed that much since then." 
</P>
<P>
Peddle quit his post at Tandon last year and he's forming his own computer 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he left, Peddle replied, "You can only have so many managers at the 
top." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkie said he butted heads with Jugi Tandon over management issues. "At the 
time he wanted complete control of the company," he said, but added that they 
remain friends. He also said Tandon can survive the downturn. "I wouldn't count 
the man out at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkie and Sparks resigned from Tandon in 1986 and run Dynabook Technologies, a 
Pleasanton, Calif.-based computer company. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes tried to cast the management changes in a positive light, saying of 
Tandon, "He's now back firmly entrenched at the helm, which is where I believe 
he should have been all along." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Sales 
</P>
<P>
Hughes also insisted that the worst is behind Tandon. Sales are growing, he 
noted, and the company is leaner because of cost-cutting moves, including a 
decision to drastically scale back U.S. operations. Field offices across the 
country were closed this year and 240 employees, or 35% of its domestic work 
force, were laid off. 
</P>
<P>
But Hughes contended: "We're not pulling back from the U.S. market at all. We 
started downsizing ourselves as a cost-efficiency move. We're simply changing 
the way we do business," by centralizing dealer services at the company's 
headquarters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes believes that this strategy can result in U.S. sales of $300 million 
within three years -- roughly equal to the firm's total 1988 sales. And by 
continuing to ride roughshod over costs, Tandon can be profitable again, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Robert Charleton at Dataquest, a high-tech research firm in San Jose, 
predicted that total PC shipments in the United States this year will increase 
10% from 1988. But competition will remain fierce, he said, and price-slashing 
will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Not all PC manufacturers are hurting. Compaq Computer, for instance, has been 
logging impressive earnings gains. "Our company is market-driven rather than 
technology-driven," said Compaq spokesman John Sweney, meaning that it designs 
products based on what it thinks the marketplace needs or wants, rather than 
developing a new technology and trying to create a market for it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar Problems 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the strengthening dollar could continue to pose problems for Tandon, 
which also recently raised its prices in Europe by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
"The question that remains to be seen is if they can raise their prices in 
Europe without losing too much business," said Bob Katzive, vice president of 
Disk/Trend, a Mountain View consulting and research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron C. Goldberg, vice president of microcomputer services at the research 
firm International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., thinks Tandon would do best 
to continue focusing on Europe, where competition isn't as tough. "Why beat 
your head against the wall in the U.S.?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon's future also depends on the response to its removable hard disk, called 
the Data Pac, which Hughes said should appeal to companies and government 
agencies that require security and the ability to transport data. But reviews 
so far have been mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked it," said Michael McCarthy, product review editor for the trade 
publication InfoWorld. McCarthy said he mailed the disk drive to test its 
ruggedness. "It survived the post office, which has to mean something," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs More 
</P>
<P>
However, the Data Pac costs more than other drives, McCarthy said. It also 
faces competition from Quantum, which makes a similar product, and from new 
floppy disks that are capable of storing far more information than the old 
floppies. 
</P>
<P>
Katzive questioned whether the Data Pac is enough to turn Tandon around. "I 
don't think they could make a living if that's the only thing they have to 
offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Set Chau, president of Total Systems, a Simi Valley computer dealer, said 
Tandon's PCs are reliable and high-quality. Yet sales of those computers aren't 
living up to expectations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes conceded that the Data Pac feature may have limited appeal. "The thing 
we're realizing is the Data Pac technology is an absolutely brilliant 
breakthrough for those with a defined need. It wasn't a solution for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, he said, Tandon's mission is to be a reliable supplier. "I don't 
expect this year to make any massive changes," he said. "I expect to 
demonstrate stability." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

VALLEY ROUNDUP: SIERRACIN DIRECTORS OK BUYOUT BY INVESTOR GROUP

Sierracin Corp.'s directors accepted a $15-a-share buyout of the Sylmar company

Glass Co. Ltd. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The group, SCS Acquisition Corp., offered in June to buy the 52% of Sierracin's

$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sierracin, which makes cockpit windows, motors and other aerospace equipment,

VALLEY ROUNDUP: HOH WATER TECHNOLOGY'S TRADING SYMBOLS CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOH Water Technology in Newbury Park said its stock trading symbols were 
changed by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers to indicate that HOH is 
again in compliance with the NASD's minimum capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
HOH's securities trade on the over-the-counter market, which is governed by the 
NASD. HOH is developing a water-filtration system for the housing and 
industrial markets. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the NASD had added a "C" to the trading symbols of HOH's three 
securities, which are its common stock, units that consist of common shares and 
warrants, and the warrants alone. The "C" indicated that the NASD, although 
finding HOH's capital to be too low, believed that HOH would soon bolster its 
capital to meet minimum levels. 
</P>
<P>
Now HOH is again in compliance and the NASD dropped the "C" from HOH's 
securities. The common stock symbol is now HOHI, the unit is HOHIU and the 
warrant is HOHIW.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: 2 BROTHERS TO SEEK VOICE ON HCC INDUSTRIES' BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two sons of Michael Pelta, a principal of HCC Industries who died last month, 
said they plan to use their 16% stake in the Encino company to seek 
representation on HCC's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Pelta said in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that during HCC's annual meeting Sept. 6, he plans to nominate 
himself and/or another person for seats on the board. Pelta made the filing 
with his brother Murray. 
</P>
<P>
The two inherited their father's 16% stake in HCC, a maker of electronic 
connection devices for the aerospace industry. Michael Pelta was one of three 
founders of the company, vice chairman of its board and president of its 
Hermetic Seal Corp. unit. 
</P>
<P>
In June, investor Walter Neubauer announced that he had increased his stake in 
HCC to 12% and was considering seeking control of the company or proposing a 
merger.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dataproducts Corp., a Woodland Hills-based maker of computer printers, 
postponed its annual meeting from Thursday to Sept. 14 in order to consider 
options for "maximizing shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 3, a New York investor group with an 8% stake in Dataproducts offered 
$273 million for the rest of the company. The group, DPC Acquisition Partners,

VALLEY EARNINGS: AMERICAN PACIFIC MINT POSTS GAIN IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Pacific Mint, a Woodland Hills-based wholesaler and retailer of 
precious metals and jewelry, reported net income of $149,194 for the second 
quarter ended June 30, compared to a loss of $141,704 a year earlier. Revenue 
grew more than fourfold to $8.6 million from $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Zuber, American Pacific Mint's chief financial officer, credited the 
company's increasing diversification into the jewelry business for the improved 
results. The firm intends to keep selling gold and silver bullion, its original 
business, Zuber said. But it plans to further emphasize its jewelry lines to 
offset its vulnerability to swings in the bullion market. 
</P>
<P>
The company also cited its recent acquisition of a controlling interest in 
Alaska Precious Metals Ltd. as contributing to the improved results. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1989, American Pacific Mint earned $45,432, compared 
to a $338,421 loss in the first half of 1988. Six-month revenues more than 
doubled to $12.6 million from $5.5 million.

S.D. MODS RIDING HIGH FOR THE WHO

<TEXT>
<P>
The Who is coming to town, and local mods like Bartley Mendoza and Scott Harper 
are ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
They are, after all, philosophical descendants of the English mods of the '60s, 
who considered the Who their preeminent musical ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
The Who's "music said a lot at the time, and still says a lot today," said 
Mendoza, the 26-year-old leader of San Diego mod revival band Manual Scan. 
"They symbolized everything the first generation of mods stood for, and what we 
continue to stand for: freedom, rebellion, daring to be different. 
</P>
<P>
"They went out of their way to canonize the mod legend with their 
'Quadrophenia' album, plus they're one of the few original mod groups you can 
still see, that's still kicking." 
</P>
<P>
"The Who was one of the first mod bands, and they influenced every mod band 
that came later," added Harper, a 22-year-old journalism student at San Diego 
City College. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we look up to them as much as we do -- they're the fathers of our 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the estimated 400 other latter-day mods living in San Diego, Mendoza 
and Harper spent much of last weekend polishing their scooters, ironing their 
pegged pants and narrow-lapel shirts, and taking their parkas to the dry 
cleaners in preparation for tonight's Who concert at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Just after noon today, they'll start arriving in Balboa Park for a preconcert 
rally around the El Cid statue. Compact discs by the Who will be awarded to the 
mod with the nicest Vespa scooter, the mod with the nicest Lambretta, and the 
mod who traveled the farthest distance. Joining the local contingent will be 
mods from Los Angeles and as far away as Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got friends coming in from all over the western United States," Harper 
said. "It's going to be a real reunion. I expect to see a lot of faces I 
haven't seen since 1982, the last time the Who played San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m., the mods will caravan to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the Who is currently on its 25th anniversary reunion tour, a lot of 
people are saying that they're washed up, that they've had it," Harper said. 
"But how can you say that when they're reuniting mods from all over the 
country, kids whose only common bond with the original mods from England is the 
chance to see the Who in their own town?" 
</P>
<P>
The first generation of mods consisted of working-class youth from London 
rebelling against society. 
</P>
<P>
They wore fancy duds like Italian mohair suit jackets, pegged pants, dressy 
shirts with narrow lapels and pointy leather shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, that was real rebellious," Harper said, "because kids were not 
supposed to dress up for shows." 
</P>
<P>
They got around on scooters rather than cars, Mendoza added, "because scooters 
typified freedom: they didn't tie you down; you could drive, and park, wherever 
you wanted to, in places where cars couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
They donned parkas "to prevent their clothes from getting wet or disheveled by 
the wind," Mendoza said. And, instead of the cheery mop-top music of the 
Beatles and other purveyors of the so-called "Liverpool sound," they listened 
to black American rhythm-and-blues, as interpreted by such 
</P>
<P>
British bands as the Small Faces, the Action, Them, and the Who, who had burst 
out of London's blue-collar West End playing a wild mix of James Brown, Motown 
and blues covers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Who was the first band to go out into the neighborhoods, into the suburbs, 
and unite mod kids from all over Britain," Harper said. "In their songs, they 
talked to the kids in their own language -- they not only understood what the 
mods were all about, they were part of it." 
</P>
<P>
The English mod scene peaked in the middle 1960s, when the Who topped the 
charts with such anthems as "My Generation" and "The Kids Are All Right." 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, the whole mod movement got so big that, even in America, 
department stores like Sears had mod fashion sections . . .," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than just a movement; it was an attitude, a life style." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1960s, mod had become passe, and acid-rock and psychedelia 
were the latest rage. And yet in the middle '70s, the movement began a revival 
that has since seen hordes of second-generation mod kids listening to the same 
music, wearing the same clothes, and espousing the same attitude as their 
first-generation mod parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something we can identify with, this feeling of rebelliousness, of 
youth, that the original mods stood for," Mendoza said. "And the Who captured 
this feeling perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
After today's Who concert, Mendoza said, most of the local mods will go for a 
cappuccino at the Gelato Vero Caffe in Mission Hills or dancing at the 2581, a 
hip dance club in East San Diego. Both are regular mod hangouts.

MOLIERE'S 'MISANTHROPE' SET ON FAST FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fantastic set, fabulous costumes, super performances and I love the concept. 
Too bad they didn't go with it. 
</P>
<P>
Forgive the industry jargon, but we're talking about the La Jolla Playhouse's 
production of Moliere's "The Misanthrope," laid -- and here comes the concept 
-- in the new Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound off the wall, but stay with me. Moliere was writing about a 
circle of Paris fops who were always kissing up to the king, right? So why not 
change them into a bunch of Hollywood trendoids who would kill to take a 
meeting with Mr. X at the studio? 
</P>
<P>
Check it out: Moliere's hero, Alceste, who can't stand hypocrisy, becomes a 
screenwriter (David Darlow at La Jolla) who won't write down to the market. 
</P>
<P>
Celimene, his girlfriend, becomes a hot new star (Kim Cattrall) who keeps 
throwing parties at her great new high-tech house in the canyon (magnificently 
designed by George Tsypin). 
</P>
<P>
Philinte, Alceste's friend, becomes a no-problem guy who believes that the best 
way to get along in the industry is to go along (William Brown). 
</P>
<P>
Eliante, Celimene's cousin, becomes an intellectual type who looks awfully 
pretty even before she takes off her glasses (Christina Haag). 
</P>
<P>
When Philinte and Eliante do lunch, they don't just do lunch. They do dim sum. 
This show is now, I promise you. For instance, Celimene has this fabulous 
training room by her pool, with a Nautilus that looks like a guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
But in the middle of the floor, there's a precious little antique gilt chair 
with wings, so that we don't lose the Sun King touch. Because underneath, it's 
still Moliere's story. 
</P>
<P>
Actually -- and here comes the criticism -- it's too much Moliere's story. At 
least, it's too much his plot. 
</P>
<P>
From line one ("What's up doc?," a pun on Moliere's "Qu'est-ce donc?"), Neil 
Bartlett's translation plays all sorts of pranks on the original text. We get 
amusing references to valet parking, to scripts in turnaround, to aging suitors 
who think they look like Willie Nelson. (Del Close plays one.) 
</P>
<P>
A mock-Hollywood patter is created and kidded, without losing Moliere's starchy 
verse structure, which the La Jolla actors have no trouble observing. Verbally, 
this is quite elegant. But there is a problem. If we are in the New Hollywood, 
why is it such a scandal that Celimene writes a few innocent love letters to 
different people? Why are we talking about "suitors" rather than studs? Why do 
people pass around their latest sonnet for criticism, rather than their latest 
rock lyric? Why don't people do drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Under the glitz and the torn jeans (Susan Hilferty did the costumes), we are 
still in the gilded court of the Sun King, without the visual help that a 
traditional production would give us. The visual clues here point to scenes 
that we don't get because Moliere didn't write them and because Bartlett 
doesn't presume to. 
</P>
<P>
But we need these scenes. We would demand them in a regular play. If Celimene 
is throwing parties to further her contacts in the industry, we want to hear 
from her about that -- not about being too young to know her own mind. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, this production -- a co-production with the Goodman Theater of 
Chicago -- is a bit of a fraud. Not for the first time at La Jolla, a bright 
idea and astute design compensate for a lack of intellectual follow-through, 
something that is necessary when taking on a giant like Moliere. If you're 
going to make a new play of "The Misanthrope," which is not forbidden, do so -- 
don't just fool with the exterior trim. Otherwise the results will be neither 
here nor there, as in this production. 
</P>
<P>
But it has a saving grace. It's very well acted. Alceste is a great role that 
no actor ever totally solves. David Darlow doesn't either, but he gives us a 
well-spoken malcontent whom we can recognize and embrace, especially in his mad 
humiliating crush on the trivial Celimene. The agony of surrendering himself to 
a divine creature who hasn't got a scrap of his intellectual consistency, and 
hardly knows he's alive, is funny -- and then not funny at all. 
</P>
<P>
And Kim Cattrall's Celimene matches Darlow's pain for a moment, before 
returning to the stubborn inconclusiveness of a beautiful young woman who 
doesn't have to make up her mind about anything yet. This Celimene is too young 
to be damned, but what will she be like at 30? 
</P>
<P>
This touches the heart of the play, the pain that Moliere himself felt about 
his own young wife, and these actors plunge into the challenge with a will. No 
compromises there. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast is able and expert as well, very happily situated in that 
big glass house over the pool. (All but Peggy Roeder as Celimene's nasty friend 
Arsinoe: Director Robert Falls doesn't seem to have come up with a concept for 
her.) It's a fun evening, but rigorous, no. You can imagine what Alceste would 
have to say about it. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;

<P>
SUNDAY BELONGS TO THE KIDS AT LA JOLLA SUMMERFEST '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's SummerFest '89 continues to serve a 
high-protein menu of chamber music to its ample Sherwood Auditorium audiences, 
the organizers have saved the sole orchestral program for the kids. Sunday at 2 
p.m., festival artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama will conduct a 40-piece 
chamber orchestra in Prokofiev's classic "Peter and the Wolf" and Rossini's 
Introduction and Variations for Clarinet and Orchestra. Gail Eichenthal, host 
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's regular radio broadcasts, will narrate and 
host the young people's concert. 
</P>
<P>
"My earliest memories of classical music are those of my father taking me to 
children's concerts given by the Los Angeles Philharmonic," Eichenthal 
recounted. "I don't know what I took away from those concerts at age 2 or 3, 
but I remember looking forward to them because it meant I had a date with my 
dad. I also remember that in those days Henri Temianka conducted the concerts." 
</P>
<P>
Some musical influence was undeniably stirred, however. Eichenthal began her 
piano studies at age 6 and continued them through college. In 1978, she broke 
new ground when she went to work for the Los Angeles Philharmonic as the first 
female host of a nationally broadcast radio series of orchestra concerts. She 
has also accompanied the orchestra on four international tours as its official 
reporter and has hosted the Philharmonic-sponsored youth concerts conducted by 
Ohyama. 
</P>
<P>
Eichenthal views a young people's concert as a chance to educate without 
appearing to be too educational, and she is not above such theatrical tricks as 
changing her costume or wearing a disguise. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first part of a concert of this type, I offer some musical 
explanations, but I try to sneak the music theory in through the back door. 
Rather than teaching, I hope to stimulate the children to listen to the music." 
</P>
<P>
In public appearances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Eichenthal has been 
given several serious assignments, including delivering the narration to a 
concert performance of Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle." But she has also been a 
soloist in Leopold Mozart's "Toy" Symphony (along with the likes of L.A. County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman and former television actress June Lockhart) at a 
Hollywood Bowl performance, and she executed a critically acclaimed solo on a 
beer bottle for a Hollywood Bowl "Hoffnung" festival concert. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Eichenthal has expanded her professional horizons beyond the 
classical music arena and is reviewing motion pictures for CBS radio's Los 
Angeles affiliate, KNX-AM. Although she will continue to host the 
Philharmonic's radio broadcasts, she has ensured her long-term connection with 
the orchestra. In 1988, she married Philharmonic clarinetist David Howard, who, 
coincidentally, will play the solo in the Rossini "Introduction and Variations" 
on Sunday's young people's concert. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the generous underwriting of the La Jolla young people's concerts by 
Peter and Peggy Preuss of Del Mar, tickets for Sunday's program are a genuine 
bargain -- $3 for children and $5 for adults. 
</P>
<P>
Get the inside story. Although some of the SummerFest '89 concerts are expected 
to sell out, among the least noticed of the festival's offerings are the master 
classes held at, and co-sponsored by, UC San Diego. This year's clinicians are 
cellist Gary Hoffman and pianist Jeffrey Kahane. The two classes (which are 
held simultaneously at 7 p.m. Thursday in Mandeville Center) are free and open 
to the public. Each performer will work with four previously auditioned 
students, offering critical comments and demonstrating approaches and 
interpretations. These master classes offer a unique opportunity to learn how 
these world-class performers approach their repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Theme and Variations. The Thomas Luis de Victoria Choir of San Diego, the 
area's newest choral ensemble, will make its debut Sunday at a 2 p.m. concert 
in the Chapel of the Carmelite Monastery in North Park. Kenneth Nielsen will 
conduct this inaugural program devoted to the motets of Victoria and 
Palestrina, as well as a "Missa Brevis" by Palestrina. Nielsen, music director 
of Our Lady of Grace Church in El Cajon, studied conducting with Germany's 
noted Bach conductor Helmut Rilling; he is also a composer whose recent work, 
"Four Saints," will be premiered by the Oregon Repertory Singers this fall in 
Portland. . . . San Diego Opera General Director Ian Campbell will take to the 
airwaves (KFSD-FM) at 5 p.m. Sunday to give local opera fans their last chance 
to acquire a subscription to the 1989-90 five-opera season. Single tickets will 
go on sale Sept. 11. The usually shy Campbell will play music from the upcoming 
season and gently hawk subscriptions. . . . This week's SummerPops offering is 
a tribute to the wit and suave compositional style of Cole Porter. Guest 
conductor Skitch Henderson will take the San Diego Symphony though its paces 
Wednesday through Saturday evenings at Hospitality Point. . . . West Coast 
Lyric Opera will present soprano Debra Pearson in a lieder recital Sunday at 
the Words and Music Gallery in Hillcrest. Pearson, who won the 1987 regional 
Metropolitan Opera Auditions here, will be accompanied by pianist Chris Allen.

GONZALEZ GETS EXPOS ON RUN, 6-1 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Gonzalez, faster than everything but the sale of Dodger season tickets, is 
finally beginning to understand. 
</P>
<P>
You don't run with just your legs. You also run with your mind. 
</P>
<P>
After countless lectures from coaches about both the wonders and dangers of 
speed, Gonzalez passed a road test Monday. He brain-stormed into second base to 
set up one run, then thoughtfully slid fast into Montreal catcher Nelson 
Santovenia to score another, leading the Dodgers to a 6-1 win over the Expos 
and ace Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
In front of 24,440 at Olympic Stadium, Gonzalez once again gave the Dodgers 
hope that somewhere inside that ability lies a true center fielder. One who 
cannot just catch a ball and slap a hit, but one who can steal a win. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got great speed, but they won't let me use it," Gonzalez complained 
afterward, referring to his six stolen bases in 69 games. "I get on base with 
nobody out and I go nowhere. They won't give me the signs. I want to be able to 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Manager Tom Lasorda: "A guy who has speed is sometimes not a good 
base stealer. Let's just say, Jose is getting smarter." 
</P>
<P>
In that context, Monday night bordered on genius. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, with Jeff Hamilton on second base and Gonzalez on first 
after his one-out single, Mike Huff's grounder to shortstop appeared to ruin 
everything. Spike Owen cleanly fielded the ball and made a quick throw to 
second to force Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Except when Tom Foley caught the ball on the base, he looked down to find 
Gonzalez was already there. With a big lead and a good jump, Gonzalez simply 
outran a sure out. 
</P>
<P>
From there, with the bases loaded, a broken-bat single by Rick Dempsey was 
enough for two runs to give the Dodgers a lead they never lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a great lead and from there, I just hustle," Gonzalez said. "When you 
get that close to the base you figure, yeah, you got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Said Huff: "I knew he had a chance. But I've played with Jose in the minor 
leagues. I've seen him nearly get a triple on a bloop ball down the left-field 
line. The guy has always had great speed. Now he's using it better." 
</P>
<P>
Later that inning Alfredo Griffin singled off the wall to score two more runs, 
but Langston held the Dodgers to just one more hit until the ninth inning, when 
Gonzalez's speed cinched it. 
</P>
<P>
He led off the inning with a double, then Huff bunted him to third. With one 
out, pinch-hitter Mike Sharperson grounded a ball to shortstop Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez again had a good jump, and arrived at the plate just as Owen's throw 
was reaching catcher Nelson Santovenia's glove. Known for his slow, hesitant 
slides, Gonzalez got down quick and kicked through Santovenia's tag. 
</P>
<P>
Home plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck called Gonzalez out. But Santovenia dropped 
the ball, as noticed by first-base umpire Bob Davidson. Gonzalez was ruled safe 
on the error, and the Expos were headed for their 13th loss in their last 18 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I just slid hard and he dropped the ball," said Gonzalez, who started all of 
but one of the 10 games on this trip, going 11 for 37 (.297) to improve his 
average to .281. He ended the night with a twisted ankle after nearly being 
picked off second base, but his confidence was strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a better base runner now, I am sliding fine now," Gonzalez said. "I learn 
all these things in the minor league, but they never let me use them. I should 
have 20 stolen bases by now. I just wish to be able to run." 
</P>
<P>
Said third-base coach Joe Amalfitano: "He is improving. But he still has room 
for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
So do the Expos, who could have used a win from Langston, who has won 10 times 
in 18 Montreal starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I put us in a hole early and the way we've been playing, we just can't afford 
to do that," said Langston, who had one of his worst performances since joining 
the Expos from Seattle May 25. In 8 1/3 innings he allowed just seven hits, but 
five earned runs with more walks (five) than strikeouts (three). 
</P>
<P>
Langston is still the National League's earned-run average leader at 2.15. But 
the third-place Expos lost a good chance to gain ground on the losing Chicago 
Cubs, and remain three games behind the East leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dodger starter Tim Belcher rebounded from three straight losses to 
improve his record to 9-12. He pitched past the seventh inning for the first 
time in July 30, going eight innings while allowing one run on five hits. 
</P>
<P>
And he said that for the first time since July 30, he didn't worry himself to 
death before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself on the bench asking to be reminded how to pitch certain 
hitters," he said. "I would never say that before, because I would have gone 
over those hitters again and again two days before the game." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Gonzalez, he was helped by another unlikely hero, catcher Rick Dempsey. 
His two-run single in the second inning broke an zero-for-16 slump with runners 
in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tremendous blast -- right over the shortstop's head," he said of the 
bloop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers witnessed one of the strangest plays of the year in the ninth 
inning, after Montreal Manager Buck Rodgers had been ejected from the game for 
arguing that Jose Gonzalez had been tagged by catcher Nelson Santovenia. In the 
course of his argument, Rodger kicked his hat near the Dodger dugout. A fan 
jumped out of the stands, casually jogged to the hat and put it on his head, 
all with no security guards in sight. He then crossed home plate and ran into 
the Montreal dugout before he was finally accosted by guards. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall left the game in the sixth inning with a bruised left thigh 
caused when he broke up a double play with a hard slide into second baseman Tom 
Foley in the second inning. "It's really sore, I took his knee right through to 
my bone," Marshall said. His status is listed as day to day. Since coming off 
the disabled list July 1, Marshall has played in 43 of 47 games and has hit in 
16 of his last 19 games to improve his average to .267 with 10 homers and 32 
runs batted in. . . . In a celebrity softball game prior to Monday's game, 
hockey star Larry Robinson made his first public appearance since leaving the 
Montreal Canadians to sign with the Kings last month. When he came to the 
plate, he was greeted more whistles (French equivalent to boos) than cheers. 
Even King teammate Luc Robitaille was more warmly greeted. "I'm not here to see 
how the public would react," said Robinson, who was embraced and welcomed by 
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda. "I can't make a decision on how this move will 
affect me until training camp." 
</P>
<P>
John Wetteland learned a new pitch in his between-starts throwing session 
Monday -- a slow curve. "It's my new toy. I can't wait to use it in a game," 
said Wetteland, who learned it from pitching coach Ron Perranoski. Wetteland 
needed to try something new after allowing 11 runs in his last 20 innings. He 
has the best hard curve on the team, but needs something in case that doesn't 
work. "I needed to correct a lot of things, and today I got them corrected," 
Wetteland said. "I'm ready to pitch again right now." . . . Mickey Hatcher said 
he's more than ready to return to action today, when he comes off the 15-day 
disabled list. "I'm beyond crazy," said Hatcher, who was disabled Aug. 6 with a 
strained left hamstring. "If I don't come back, I'm going to tear the called 
out by home plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck. But locker room up." Hatcher's return 
will mean a one-day major league stay for rookie third baseman Dave Hansen, who 
arrived in Montreal at 1 a.m. Monday to replace Franklin Stubbs, who was hurt 
last weekend and will undergo knee surgery. "I was in my hotel room today and 
I'm thinking, I don't know what I'm doing here," said Hansen, who was on the 
28th floor. "This is a big skyscraper and I'm on top of it. It didn't all sink 
in until I came to the park and put on the uniform." Hansen was recalled from 
double-A San Antonio. Even after today he'll may still have a promotion, as he 
could be sent to triple-A Albuquerque to finish their season as a replacement 
for the AWOL Tracy Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin's sore right elbow was examined by Dr. Frank Jobe last weekend 
but according to Griffin, nothing extraordinary was found. Griffin continues to 
play in mild pain, particularly when he swings the bat. . . . The Expos' homer 
and RBI leader Andres Galarraga was rested Monday. He was one for eight against 
Dodger starter Tim Belcher this season and three for 17 against the Dodgers.

WITH FINLEY OUT, ANGELS LOSE FOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
STARTER'S TOE INJURY IN FIRST INNING OPENS DOOR FOR ROYALS, 4-2

<TEXT>
<P>
The longest trip of the Angels' season is one game old, but already, it's 
getting longer. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley, the winningest pitcher in the Angels' starting rotation, had to 
be removed in the first inning of Monday night's 4-2 loss to the Kansas City 
Royals after just 17 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The symptom: Stinging pain in the fourth toe of Finley's left foot. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis: Possible stress fracture, contingent on further X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
The consequence? 
</P>
<P>
If it's a stress fracture, the Angels don't even want to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too soon to start speculating," said Roger Williams, the Angels' physical 
therapist. "The (initial) X-rays were negative. There was not an obvious 
break." 
</P>
<P>
But, Williams added, "A stress fracture is not going to show up on an X-ray. A 
bone scan would have to be done. If there is a stress fracture, no, he wouldn't 
be able to pitch with it." 
</P>
<P>
Additional steps will be taken after the Angels' training staff consults today 
with team physician Lewis Yocum. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to determine if more tests are needed or not," Manager Doug Rader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And so begins the trip that could very well make or break the Angels in their 
chase of the Oakland Athletics in the American League West. Fifteen games in 15 
grueling days, with the Angels trudging through Kansas City, Texas, Boston and 
New York before coming up for air the day after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
And on the first day, the Angels fell a game behind Oakland when they: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost to Kansas City for the sixth consecutive time at Royals Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost right fielder Claudell Washington in the fourth inning because of an 
apparent case of the stomach flu. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost a chance to throw out Bo Jackson on a fourth-inning stolen base 
attempt when catcher Lance Parrish cocked his arm and caught home-plate umpire 
Dave Phillips in the mask, resulting in no play and an eventual Kansas City 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost a run in the fifth inning on a controversial call by Phillips, who 
ruled Royal catcher Mike Macfarlane had successfully tagged Jack Howell before 
losing his grip on the ball during a sprawling play at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Handed Kansas City two runs in the fifth after the Royals loaded the bases 
on an error by third baseman Bobby Rose, a ball that glanced off Rose's glove 
and a bunt that Parrish failed to field cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
"Crazy game," Parrish said. "You don't expect things like that to happen . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a half-smile, he added, "but, that's what makes this game so great." 
</P>
<P>
If ever an Angel trip got off on the wrong foot, this was it. And Finley's 
injury helped ruin an anticipated showdown against Kansas City's Bret 
Saberhagen -- both pitchers were trying for their 15th victory -- before the 
first inning was history. 
</P>
<P>
Finley first felt the pain warming up in the bullpen. It wasn't long before the 
sensation became obvious to every player and coach on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw where a couple of times he winced when he threw the ball," Parrish said. 
"It was the foot he uses to push off the rubber. You could tell it was causing 
him a lot of pain." 
</P>
<P>
Rader said he could tell as much by Finley's third pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the expression on his face and then I noticed how his delivery 
deteriorated because of it," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
With the count 3-1 to Kansas City's leadoff hitter, Kurt Stillwell, Rader sent 
Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann to the mound for closer observation. 
Finley threw a couple of warmup tosses and Lachemann gave him the OK to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Stillwell then hit a triple off the base of the center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
Finley got the next batter, Kevin Seitzer, to pop to first base, but yielded a 
run-scoring ground-out to George Brett. Then, he threw two balls to Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Lachemann returned to the mound and Finley was through. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Finley was on his way to nearby St. Luke's Hospital for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen (15-5) limited the Angels to six hits in eight innings, with Brian 
Downing driving in both runs with his 10th home run and a sacrifice fly. Rose 
might have driven in another, if not for Phillips' call on Howell in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
With Howell on third base, Rose lofted a fly ball to right field, prompting 
Howell to tag up and break for home. Pat Tabler made a strong throw to the 
plate and Macfarlane tried to make a sweeping tag on Howell, who dove 
head-first for the plate. 
</P>
<P>
As Macfarlane rolled over, Phillips waved Howell out -- just as the baseball 
was popping out of Macfarlane's glove. Rader and Angel third base coach Moose 
Stubing immediately rushed down the line to protest, claiming Macfarlane hadn't 
maintained possession. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips asked for a second opinion from third-base umpire Al Clark, who also 
determined Macfarlane's tag was good. 
</P>
<P>
Deprived of one scoring opportunity, the Angels quickly devised one for Kansas 
City in the fifth. First, Rose botched a leadoff grounder by Frank White. Then, 
he failed to make a leaping catch of a line drive by Macfarlane, having the 
ball tick off the top of his glove for a single. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Parrish bobbled a bunt by Stillwell . . . and the bases were loaded 
with no outs. 
</P>
<P>
Seitzer singled home one run, Brett drove in another with a sacrifice fly and 
the Angels were suddenly down, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Counting the top of the inning, that was a three-run swing," Rader lamented. 
"It came down to the way a few balls were handled -- and, consequently, that 
was the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel third-base coach Moose Stubing, on the Jack Howell-Mike Macfarlane play 
in the fifth inning: "The rule says there has to be possession. (Macfarlane) 
caught the ball, made the tag, rolled over and when he hit the ground, the ball 
bounces up in the air. Where's the possession there? The play was still one." 
Added Howell: "Usually on that kind of play, you have to show the ball -- you 
have to bring it out of the glove and show the umpire. You always see that kind 
of play, with the umpire winding up, winding up -- and then he sees the ball 
and makes the call. Did (Macfarlane) show the ball? If the rule says he has to 
show the the umpire, then I would think I'd have to be ruled safe." 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson was credited with his 24th stolen base of the season, soon to score 
his 66th run, when Angel catcher Lance Parrish had his throw attempt thwarted 
by home-plate umpire Dave Phillips. Instead of releasing the ball, Parrish's 
right hand hit Phillips in the face, knocking off the umpire's mask. Parrish 
never let go of the ball on the play, thus, according to the catcher, removing 
the possibility of an interference call. "If I would've thrown the ball, 
(Phillips) would've been able to do something about it," Parrish said. "But he 
told me that because I didn't throw the ball, there was nothing he could do." 
From second base, Jackson scored on a bloop double by Kansas City's next 
hitter, Jim Eisenreich.

NEWSWIRE: IAAF COULD TAKE JOHNSON'S WORLD RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's world 
governing body, will discuss possible action that could strip Canada's Ben 
Johnson of his world record in the 100-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's mark of 9.83 seconds was set at the 1987 World Championships in Rome. 
In 1988, at the Olympic Games in Seoul, he improved on the time by winning in 
9.79. 
</P>
<P>
At the Olympics, however, he tested positive for steroids, was stripped of his 
gold medal and his world record time was disallowed. He since has testified 
that he used steroids before the meet in Rome as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't discuss the Johnson case specifically, but we will organize a plan to 
fight doping in general," said Primo Nebiolo, president of the IAAF, pertaining 
to the body's meeting in Barcelona, Spain, Sept. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development in Toronto, athletes, coaches and track officials all 
share blame for Canada's humiliation over the Johnson scandal, said Rolf Lund, 
chairman of the Ontario Track and Field Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a federal inquiry into drug use in amateur sports, Lund said: 
"Any knowledgeable coach would have noticed the (physical) changes" in Johnson 
and other top Canadian athletes, who testified at the inquiry that they took 
banned substances for years.

The chancellor of North Carolina State resigned, the first official to step 
down since allegations were raised against the school's basketball program in 
the book, "Personal Fouls." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Poulton, who in the 1986-87 academic year intervened on behalf of three 
Wolfpack players -- Charles Shackleford, Teviin Binns and Kelsey Weems -- to 
keep them from failing, resigned after seven years as chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation comes before the release of a six-month investigation into 
Wolfpack athletics. University of North Carolina system president C.D. Spangler 
will present the report Friday to the 32-member UNC Board of Governors, who 
will decide whether to take action against basketball coach and athletic 
director Jim Valvano, the focus of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jones, chairman of the UNC Board of Governors, said it was his 
understanding that Spangler had not asked for Poulton's resignation, but 
confirmed that the charges raised in "Personal Fouls" have merit. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what's been written is factual," Jones told the Winston-Salem 
Journal. "They are more than allegations. There are a lot of things that have 
not yet been written."

Tennis isn't fun for Larisa Savchenko anymore and it shows. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Soviet lost, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, to unseeded American teen-ager 
Donna Faber Monday in the first round of the Player's Ltd. Challenge at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
She then announced that she would retire after next week's U.S. Open, saying 
she made the decision last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I will think about it again," Savchenko said. "But it's not possible to play 
tennis like (I am) now. It's not tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"I just am not enjoying the game and I don't think it's fun," said the 
16th-seeded Savchenko, who seemed to be going through the motions in the final 
two sets of her loss to Faber. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round action, Robin White defeated Leila Meskhi of the Soviet 
Union, 6-2, 6-1; Gigi Fernandez beat Louise Field of Australia, 6-3, 6-4; Anne 
Minter of Australia eliminated Rene Simpson of Canada, 6-0, 6-3, and Ann 
Grossman beat Maureen Drake of Canada, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The top four seeded players, Martina Navratilova, Gabriela Sabatini, Chris 
Evert and Arantxa Sanchez, each had first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Jose Luis Aparisi defeated eighth-seeded Thomas Haldin of Sweden, 7-5, 
6-2, in the opening round of a clay-court tournament in the tiny European 
independent republic of San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round action, Claudio Mezzadri of Switzerland defeated Pablo 
Arraya of Peru, 6-3, 6-0; Pablo Azar of Argentina eliminated Austrian Oliver 
Fuchs 7-5, 6-2; and another Austrian, Stefan Lochbihler, overcame Andres Vysand 
of the Soviet Union, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Jeff Sunday, a 33-year-old attorney, admits he does not have much chance of

<P>
But he and a host of other weekend golfers will tee off today in the six-day 
quest for a title won by such players as Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer and Jack 
Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, of Carlisle, Pa., expressed the feelings of many of the 312 in the 
field before a practice round Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, winning is unrealistic," he said. "It's just a thrill to be here. I'm 
going to have a great time. The tradition pumps me up." 
</P>
<P>
Tradition abounds at the Merion Golf Club. In 1930, Merion was the scene of one 
of the United States Golf Assn.'s most memorable moments -- Jones completing 
the Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, the Grand Slam consisted of the U.S. Open, U.S. Amateur, British 
Open and British Amateur. Jones was the only golfer to accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
The amateur championships have been replaced in the Grand Slam by the Masters 
and PGA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the fifth Amateur at Merion, the first since 1966. The club also 
has been the site of four U.S. Opens, the 1954 Curtis Cup and the 1960 World 
Amateur Team Championship. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why a lot of guys are here, because it's Merion," said David Eger of 
Ponte Verde, Fla., a U.S. Walker Cup team member and one of the more prominent 
members of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mickelson of Arizona State and San Diego, also a U.S. Walker Cup player, 
said: "This is a great course, has a lot of history. It gets you excited to 
come out and play." 
</P>
<P>
The two days of medal qualifying will be at two courses, with 156 players at 
the par-70 Merion layout and 156 at the nearby par-71 Waynesborough Country 
Club course. 
</P>
<P>
The players will switch courses Wednesday.

POLONIA CONVICTED ON SEX CHARGE, WILL BE SENTENCED AFTER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Yankee outfielder Luis Polonia was convicted in Milwaukee Monday of 
having sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl, but the judge postponed 
sentencing until after the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia, 24, pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge that he had sex with 
the girl at a downtown hotel last Wednesday. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge 
Thomas Doherty then found him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Doherty said in an interview after the hearing that he delayed sentencing until 
Oct. 2 to provide ample time for a presentence report to be completed. "The 
baseball season was not a factor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The regular baseball season ends Oct. 1. Polonia's bail was continued at $5,000 
and prosecutors said he will not have to return to Milwaukee until the next 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wisconsin law, an adult may not have intercourse with a child under age 
16 even if the child consents. The charge carries a maximum penalty of nine 
months in jail and $10,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia is a citizen of the Dominican Republic, but Ronald Swan, a U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service agent in Milwaukee, said the player 
could not be deported because of the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal complaint said the girl told authorities she and Polonia had 
intercourse twice, once before the girl's mother called the hotel and talked to 
the player and once after the phone call. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said the girl told authorities that, after Polonia answered the 
phone call, he asked her "if she was a minor and she indicated she was and she 
believes she may have told him that she was 16 years old." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said Polonia told authorities he was told earlier that the girl 
was 19. 
</P>
<P>
Tests on right-hander Dwight Gooden's shoulder muscle tear show improvement, 
but the injury is not completely healed, New York Mets' General Manager Frank 
Cashen said. 
</P>
<P>
Cashen said the pitcher will continue to throw on the sidelines and in the 
bullpen. Gooden will undergo additional testing in two to three weeks to 
determine if there has been any improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden (9-4) has been on the disabled list since July 3 after sustaining a torn 
subcapularis muscle in his right shoulder directly above his arm pit. 
</P>
<P>
A deal to sell the Seattle Mariners to a pair of Indianapolis businessmen "will 
work out sometime this week or it won't work out at all," owner George Argyros 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Argyros and the other two principals in the proposed sale -- Jeff Smulyan and 
Michael Browning -- all stayed in the same downtown Seattle hotel Sunday night, 
but didn't meet or see each other. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of changes that need to be made, points to be straightened 
out, and we spent our own time doing that tonight," Argyros said Sunday. "I 
won't say I'm happy with the deal or unhappy with it. It is complex." 
</P>
<P>
Argyros also confirmed he could receive "close" to $76.1 million, the 
reappraisal price of the Mariners figured in June. He paid $13.1 million for 
the franchise in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for Nolan Ryan to go into any wild celebration if he gets his 
5,000th strikeout victim tonight against the Oakland Athletics at Arlington, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do nothing," Ryan said. "My idea is we have a game to win and I don't 
want it to be a distraction. I'll just take the ball home and put it with the 
rest of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has kept all the baseballs from his five no-hitters and strikeouts in 
increments of 500. 
</P>
<P>
"I just give them to Ruth (his wife) and she marks on them what happened," Ryan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For fans, the memories will come at a higher price. Ticket agencies are getting 
up to $200 for a $10 ticket to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been crazy. They just want anything -- nosebleeds, field box," said 
Danielle Koot of First Row Tickets in Dallas. "At first, we estimated it would 
be big. But it's more than that. It's huge. Not many people are caring how much 
the price is." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 42, needs six strikeouts against the A's to reach 5,000.

REDSKINS' GIBBS SETS HIS SIGHTS ON DISCOVERING A BETTER PUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MINNEAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Gibbs has given his punters a blunt public message. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is an important week for us," the Washington Redskins coach said. 
"We've been fooling around here for a while, about four or five weeks. We need 
somebody to step up and show us he can do it, or we've got problems. Now is the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
As the Redskins begin a stretch of two games in five days -- Monday night 
against the Minnesota Vikings in the Metrodome and Friday night against the 
Miami Dolphins at RFK Stadium in Washington -- Gibbs' message applies to 
several other players besides punters Greg Horne and Richard Tuten. 
</P>
<P>
After the Redskins play these two games, they'll have to make the mandatory cut 
to 60 players Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
They'll then have only one exhibition game left -- in New Orleans against the 
Saints on Sept. 1 -- before they open the regular season Monday night, Sept. 
11, against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins are getting close to decision time. For players fighting for 
roster spots, there's not much time left. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Horne, a Plan B free agent signed from the Phoenix Cardinals, went 
into camp favored to beat out Tuten, who was cut by the San Diego Chargers, for 
the punting job. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Horne nor Tuten has distinguished himself, and the job is up for 
grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Horne said he's been punting well in practice, but he's been pressing in the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get over that in a hurry," Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Sevier, the special-teams coach, said if neither of the punters steps 
forward, "We'll make a decision and we'll live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Sevier hopes one of them will make it an easy decision. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd like to have somebody win it on the field instead of us having to make a 
sort of subjective decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The punters won't be the only players under the microscope. The battle for the 
fourth wide receiver-kick returner spot continues with Stephen Hobbs getting a 
look this week. Newcomer Joe Howard also figures to get a look as a returner. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, much of the attention will focus on the quarterback slot, where Stan 
Humphries will make his first start in a Redskins uniform, Bill Kenney will 
make his first appearance in a Redskins uniform and Mark Rypien will get a 
chance to finish up. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rypien is expected to start the season because Doug Williams is 
ailing, Rypien really is the only starter on offense who's not entrenched, 
except at wide receiver where three players -- Art Monk, Gary Clark and Ricky 
Sanders -- are sharing the two starting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
If Williams hadn't suffered a nerve root irritation in his back, he would have 
been the incumbent quarterback. But it now looks as if the Redskins will go 
into the season without both Williams and running back Kelvin Bryant. Both 
eventually may go on the physically-unable-to-perform list and miss the first 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant was ruled out of contact work Saturday for six more weeks after being 
examined by a Los Angeles physician. Trainer Bubba Tyer said, "This thing with 
Doug and Kelvin hangs over us like a cloud. We need answers, and camp is 
breaking within a week. Coach Gibbs has to know how to put this team together." 
</P>
<P>
On defense, there are battles for starting jobs at defensive end (Dexter Manley 
vs. Markus Koch), defensive tackle (Curtis Maxey vs. rookie Tracy Rocker), 
middle linebacker (Greg Manusky vs. Neal Olkewicz) and free safety (Todd Bowles 
vs. Barry Wilburn). 
</P>
<P>
The veteran facing the toughest fight is Olkewicz, because he knows the 
Redskins aren't going to keep a 32-year-old, 11-year veteran around as a 
backup. He has to win the starting job to keep a job. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Peccatiello, the linebackers coach, said he'll pull Olkewicz after the 
first two series again so he can get a long look at Manusky and Don Graham, a 
Plan B free agent. 
</P>
<P>
But Peccatiello said the long looks other players are getting doesn't mean 
Olkewicz is being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys (Manusky and Graham) he's competing with haven't exactly reached out 
and taken the job. We're not giving the job to anyone. Somebody's got to take 
it from Olkewicz, and that hasn't happened yet," Peccatiello said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Don't discount Neal. There's a lot to be said for trust and 
confidence and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Olkewicz considered retiring in the off-season, but said four factors persuaded 
him to return for one more season -- he had a what he called a "decent year" 
last season, he was free of injury, he didn't want to end his career with a 
losing season, and his wife became pregnant, giving him "another mouth to 
feed." His first son -- and second child -- was born during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Olkewicz isn't worrying about his fate. "I'm not going to mope around," he 
said. "I have no control over it." 
</P>
<P>
He also has no idea what the coaches are thinking. "I'll be the last to know," 
he said. "Team sources will tell the reporters. My goal is to find out who the 
team sources are before I leave." 
</P>
<P>
Peccatiello said: "The coaching staff won't be surprised if he's our starting 
middle linebacker Monday night (in the opener)." 
</P>
<P>
What happens this week may determine whether Olkewicz can survive his last 
challenge.

KENNEY GETS CHANCE TO PLAY THIRD FIDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CARLISLE, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Gibbs always has been known as an innovative coach, but he has outdone 
himself. He has divided an NFL game into thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Four quarters are not viable for a coach who has three quarterbacks he wants to 
test, as Gibbs will Monday night in the Washington Redskins' pre-season game at 
Minnesota. So Gibbs has broken the 60-minute game into thirds. Stan Humphries 
will play the first 20 minutes, Bill Kenney the middle 20 and Mark Rypien the 
final third. 
</P>
<P>
Humphries and Rypien are young, but they have been around enough to become 
familiar with the Redskins, and vice versa. But Kenney -- who knows him? 
</P>
<P>
There are mental images of him, and they are not particularly good ones. As a 
Kansas City Chief, he appeared in an occasional NFL highlight film, but usually 
it was the highlight film of the other team. There's a faint recollection of a 
Pro Bowl appearance in 1983. There are more than 17,000 passing yards and 
numerous team single-season records. There even is longevity that makes him, at 
age 34, the oldest Redskin, nearly seven months the senior of Doug Williams. 
</P>
<P>
But still, who knows who Bill Kenney really is? And why in the world, so close 
to the end of his career, is he here? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fans in Kansas City thought I was a nice guy, but not a great 
quarterback," he said. "I had some good years, but when you don't win. ... " 
</P>
<P>
Kenney came to the Redskins last month as an insurance policy when Williams's 
lower back began to ache. He eschewed an opportunity to be the No. 2 
quarterback in Atlanta so he could become the No. 5 man here. He had never been 
with a winner before, save for one AFC wildcard game in 1986. You can't 
overestimate the importance that holds for him. 
</P>
<P>
"My objective has been to play with a team that I feel, selfishly, can get me 
to where I want to go, which is the playoffs, but on the other hand, that I can 
help," he said. "I looked at the situation here and they offered the best of 
both those objectives." 
</P>
<P>
Kenney, who came out of Northern Colorado and joined the Chiefs as a free agent 
in 1979 after being cut by the Redskins, has a better sense of humor than one 
might expect of a quarterback on a hapless team. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the Hall of Fame the other day and the guys said: 'Hey Bill, come 
here. Come here.' Howie Long was the defensive lineman of the year in the 
Miller Lite display of, I think it was 1987. They have a bunch of pictures of 
me (being sacked by Long). I've also had comments from people on the Sports 
Illustrated Crunchman (advertisement) that I'm in there 50 percent of the 
time."

HOOKED AND PREGNANT: A TIME BOMB

<TEXT>
<P>
The crazy thing was, she'd buy more crack, then throw up as soon as she smoked 
it. What is this lousy stuff cooked with? she wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
She bit down on a piece to test it, and the drug numbed her tongue, just as it 
was supposed to. Everyone else was getting off OK. So how come I'm the only one 
getting sick? 
</P>
<P>
Girl, you're pregnant is all, people told her. They snickered and pointed. And 
maybe they were right. There was every reason to think so. How do I get rid of 
a baby? she asked them. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion was out. That costs money, and money was better spent for drugs. 
People suggested that she sit in scalding water or drink turpentine. But why 
suffer so much just to kill a child? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Addict's Logic 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Barbara Colbert smoked even more. If she used enough crack, she'd be 
high and the baby would be dead. To an addict of two years, that kind of 
happily-ever-after scheme made pretty good sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Give me a dime rock," she would tell the dealers, trading $10 for each hit, 
then smoking it all up and never chipping it into pieces, so that a big dose 
could get way down to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
But what happened next goes against formula because somehow the crack -- a 
smokable, maximum-strength form of cocaine -- did not totally consume Barbara 
with its usual gangrene of the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
One day she asked for help, something all too rare for an addict. And that same 
day she got it, which is all too rare for society. 
</P>
<P>
What if the whole besotted mass of them -- the hopheads and street pros and 
petty thieves -- swore off drugs and came in for treatment? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is disturbing, for the redemptive moment is easily lost. The resolve 
to quit crack, like the high itself, comes on so fast and is gone so soon, 
quick as a shiver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Programs Overwhelmed 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there is only about one treatment slot for every 26 people whose 
drug use "seriously impairs their health or ability to function," according to 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). 
</P>
<P>
A sweeping new national anti-drug strategy, drafted by William J. Bennett -- 
the Bush Administration's point man on drugs -- proposes, among other things, a 
50% increase in federal support for drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But there is such a long way to go. In Miami, where Barbara Colbert lives, the 
wait to get into a residential drug program is five months. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, the wait can be half a year; federal and state budget 
cuts have reduced public treatment slots by 25% since 1981, as the number of 
addicts has multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
"Cocaine abusers come to us in urgency, and there is anger when they can't get 
in," said Irma Strantz, the Los Angeles drug program administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Colbert understands how that goes. She asks: What would have happened 
if I hadn't fought with my mother in the street and my cousin hadn't come along 
and taken me right then to the detox center and the door hadn't swung open? 
</P>
<P>
"What would have happened to Cornelius, to my baby?" 
</P>
<P>
But that is to get ahead of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have rigged up cages so that laboratory rats can push a lever and 
get high. Some of the rodents get heroin, some cocaine. Researchers then 
compare the damage. Cocaine is worse. 
</P>
<P>
While the heroin rats quickly get hooked, they also settle into a stable 
pattern of use. They keep their body weights up, their fur clean. Few of them 
die. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine rats, in contrast, use the drug erratically, unrestrained one day and 
sparingly the next. They grow thin and motley and fitful. Most die. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, entire neighborhoods have become much like the rigged 
cages of the laboratories. Pellets of crack -- made from cocaine, baking soda 
and water -- -- are as cheap as $1, as easy to get as pushing a lever. 
</P>
<P>
Half a million Americans smoke crack, NIDA estimates. Their bloodstreams rush 
the drug from the lungs to the brain in about five seconds. "It knocked me 
right to my knees," Barbara said. "Cloud 50, way into outer space." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Town Setting 
</P>
<P>
Back in the spring of 1987, crack was just getting acquainted with Florida 
City, a small town south of Miami where urban blight disappears into vast 
tomato fields, a junction of migrant and ghetto life. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Colbert, then 24, lived there, usually with her mother, Joann, who was 
retired on a pension. Barbara, you ought to be making more of yourself, Joann 
would tell her. 
</P>
<P>
She couldn't understand what had happened to the daughter who had run track in 
high school and made the honor roll. Here she was, drinking so much beer and 
sniffing cocaine. That's all any of them do around here! 
</P>
<P>
Barbara had a little boy, Rubin, born of an abandoned romance. Caring for him 
always seemed to get left to Joann. Is that really fair? the grandmother 
demanded to know. You leave the boy lying around like an old doll. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara had her own standards, and she figured herself to be a better mom 
than most. She had a job over at Bojangles, the fast-food chicken place, and 
she brought home a paycheck. Why shouldn't she party whenever she wanted to? 
</P>
<P>
Two friends came over one night with something new. It's almost a blackout, 
it's so intense, they promised. They showed her how to smoke some stuff called 
crack out of a glass that had foil on top with holes punched around. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara inhaled. This first kiss was magic, though it lasted hardly a few 
minutes. Her lips jerked and her mouth drooled. Where can I get some more, she 
wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
She felt hooked right away, she recalls, and that's something many addicts say, 
though there are too many dabblers around for that to be true for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
In an hour she was off to buy an "eight ball," slang for a round, cookie-sized 
chunk of crack, enough for 20 dime pieces but costing only $120 or so. She 
shared, this time. 
</P>
<P>
Days later, she would binge alone. Barbara locked herself in her room and told 
Rubin to stay away. On a table she set out four Schlitz malt liquor cans, with 
holes punched in the sides to make them into pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Four cans were better than one because she wouldn't have to stop when a hole 
clogged up. A big $15 rock was enough for breathing in three good hits, and she 
put one piece on top of each can. 
</P>
<P>
She smoked methodically but without hurry. Then she relaxed on the bed, and her 
thoughts were serene and frightless. 
</P>
<P>
Those were great days, she says. But they didn't last. Soon after, whenever she 
climbed for a big high, she made it up fewer stairs all the time. 
</P>
<P>
She knew she needed to get ever bigger amounts -- either that or to cut back -- 
and the first choice was always the easier. Was she lost to crack by then? 
</P>
<P>
Yes and no, Barbara says. She was still able to work. She rarely missed a day. 
She would grind up some crack and lace it across a reefer she could smoke on 
the job when no one was looking. 
</P>
<P>
She remembers baking biscuits in the Bojangles kitchen. She had put the flour 
and lard and milk in a huge metal bowl and was ready to mix it. She puffed at 
the reefer, glancing around from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the boss was coming. She dropped the drugs into the batter and folded 
it in, nonchalant as she could be, with her heart thumping. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was nothing to do but slice the dough, grease the cookie sheet and 
put it all in the oven. And hope nobody tasted a thing. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are not sure exactly how cocaine works on people, though there seems 
to be a consensus that it makes the brain chemistry go tipsy. Dopamine is one 
of the chemicals in the brain that regulates feelings of pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
One theory has it that cocaine -- especially in big, quick doses of crack -- 
causes extra amounts of dopamine to surge into the brain's pleasure centers. 
</P>
<P>
With repeated use the dopamine supply is depleted, so much so that it would 
take months to catch up. Users only make it worse by smoking more. No matter 
what, they feel anxious and depressed. 
</P>
<P>
As time went by, Barbara came to understand this in her own way. 
</P>
<P>
Before, it was as if she were two compatible people, her off drugs and her on. 
It was all right either way. 
</P>
<P>
But now there was an unhappy separation. The more basic Barbara was the one who 
was high, and the other, waiting to get up, felt awful and incomplete. "After a 
while, you're just getting high to get normal," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She discarded her job, and when she found work again, the jobs discarded her. 
Her mother threw her out. Barbara took Rubin and moved in with her father in 
nearby Goulds. The granddad liked the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Goulds was much like Florida City. It seemed easier to find people on crack 
than off. Who'd even mess with you if you weren't on drugs? she says. 
</P>
<P>
On the streets, someone was always running up, shouting, What do you need? Then 
three more would make it a crowd: Mine is better than his! 
</P>
<P>
Soon, she knew all the dealers, the ones who sold the good stuff and the ones 
who peddled "dummies" with cocaine on the tips and wax inside. 
</P>
<P>
Days sped away amid the curling smoke in crack houses, where the entrance fee 
was a chip off what she had just bought. There was a "quick hit room" for those 
in a rush -- and sofas and beds for those with time. 
</P>
<P>
The water was usually turned off and the toilets stunk, but the lights worked. 
A TV was always playing, and people stared listlessly, comfortable in their 
common decline, limp in their chairs like wilted plants. 
</P>
<P>
When Barbara thought of it, she'd remember to bring a dollar to Rubin. The boy 
wanted a mother. He had a Parent's Day at school and she promised to go, but 
the hours eddied away from her and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
Money became a problem, and she was too scared to steal. Her body was the only 
thing she had to sell, and it seemed sensible to do so, this commodity easily 
traded away and yet never used up. 
</P>
<P>
The cars moved slowly along 220th Street. Barbara was cheap. Do whatever and 
just go, she told the men. Or maybe she said friendlier things -- and just felt 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
The profits went too often for crack and too seldom for rent. She quarreled 
with her father, and he and his lady friend kicked her out, too. 
</P>
<P>
She wandered at night into abandoned houses. She held a match in the air and 
searched for shapes in the darkness, her eyes shuttling from side to side. If 
the rooms were empty, she'd curl up on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pregnant and Sick 
</P>
<P>
Where did she get pregnant? She does not know -- maybe in Goulds or back in 
Florida City or a place in between. She hated the baby who was on the way and 
prayed it would die. She was sick most every day. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara was no longer a bargain on the streets. She smelled. Her clothes were 
dirty. Her hair was nappy and her face sunken. 
</P>
<P>
She begged her mother for help. The two argued. "She told me I wasn't her 
mother any more, and I said I didn't care," Joann recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara did get back into the house, off and on. She promised to reform. 
And, one weekend last November, Joann even left her pregnant daughter with $250 
rent money. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara spent $10, then more and more, until, finally, it was almost gone. 
Joann found her on a street corner, trying to catch a bus back to Goulds. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the money? she demanded. And the two wrestled against a car, until a 
cousin pried away the choke hold that had been closed around Barbara's neck. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, thousands of newborns -- estimates go as high as 375,000 -- suffer 
damage from their mothers' use of drugs. At Jackson Memorial, the public 
hospital in Miami, doctors project that cocaine affects about one in eight 
births. 
</P>
<P>
That is scary. The placenta acts more as a sponge than as a shield. Many of the 
"crack babies" will be born seizure-prone and irritable and hyperactive. Some 
will have deformed limbs and hearts and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Such children are overburdening the nation's child welfare systems. They 
require special care and education, and some school systems -- Los Angeles 
among them -- are setting aside classrooms just for such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the youngsters are being spoken of as a lost generation. They were 
lost in the womb, where crack, booze and other drugs left them a mile behind at 
the startling line. 
</P>
<P>
In the hospitals, the mothers arrive in labor. They are often malnourished, 
unkempt, lacking any prenatal care. Some have used crack to try to kill the 
fetus -- and some to hasten delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Crack has overwhelmed the maternal instinct. Or just about: "If they can get 
crack, it's the hell with the baby," Dr. Estelle Whitney said. "But most say: 
Keep me away from the drugs. If I'm around it, I'll use it. Help!" 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Colbert, three months pregnant, wanted help. Somehow, she began to 
think of the baby inside her. Maybe that baby could really become something. 
</P>
<P>
Timing is important. Any drug use threatens the fetus, but doctors have found 
that use after the first trimester is significantly worse. 
</P>
<P>
A Miami treatment program, the Family Health Center, is one of the few in the 
nation devoted to pregnant crack users and the babies they bear. It has only 15 
spaces, but there was an opening. Barbara got it. 
</P>
<P>
She was hesitant. The vibes were bad. They had lots of rules. Ask them why, and 
they always said it was to help you and not hurt you. Well, that kind of talk 
is for school kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of wanted to get help and I sort of didn't," Barbara says. "I wanted to 
be taken care of and I wanted to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, there are no magic regimens for treating crack addicts. No one 
has a drug to take its place, like methadone instead of heroin. And no one has 
a two, four or six-month plan to clean people up for good. 
</P>
<P>
The one command is abstinence, and programs usually combine that with a lot of 
structure. Keep the addicts busy. Convince them drugs are bad. Teach them how 
to cope with what they meet up with on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Crack has found a market among the rich and poor -- black and white. Experts 
say the toughest people to help are those with the least to lose, those with no 
job to go back to and no family to stand beside them. 
</P>
<P>
Some drug programs try to be job programs as well: teach the addicts basic 
skills, make them study for their high school diploma, find them work. After 
all, what chance do people have if they walk out the door jobless and homeless? 
</P>
<P>
Dropout and relapse rates vary, depending on the program, who is in it and how 
well those in charge keep track. It is not unusual to hear that crack wins out 
over treatment 70% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Colbert quickly found out it would not be easy. Crack was home to her, 
and treatment felt almost like jail. They were making her do up her bed 
military style, with the sheet so tight she could bounce a coin on it. 
</P>
<P>
And they wanted her attending one stupid meeting after another, where people 
confessed their troubles like at some kind of revival. 
</P>
<P>
Late at night, Barbara would sneak a cigarette, rocking in a chair and 
listening for what the dark had brought into the alley outside her window. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, she could hear people stumble by at 2 or 3 a.m. She guessed they 
were addicts, scouring the ground to see if anything useful had been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Who else could they be? she reasoned. And she envied them. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine withdrawal is a shock to the brain, but the first days without it are 
more a mental blow than a physical one. Crack addicts are usually overtired and 
hyper and depressed. But craving is not severe. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are trying various anti-depressant drugs and even acupuncture to 
help addicts get past the first week -- the "detox." Some say the results are 
promising -- and some say no. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the hardest part of treatment is not the initial days, but the long 
haul. Cravings come and go. Often, the addicts think they have put the worst 
behind them only to find it up ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Rawson of the Matrix Center in Beverly Hills says the roughest 
period of recovery is that time between six weeks and four months. He calls it 
"the wall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temptation Lurks 
</P>
<P>
Boredom and languor have set in. Concentration is weak. A single hit of crack, 
then, comes to seem both necessary and harmless. Give me a beer or a joint or 
anything for a jolt. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say that crack -- because of the speed and wallop of the high -- 
leaves an enduring stamp. Craving is triggered by the simplest of cues: money, 
a song, that certain smile on a drug-sated face. 
</P>
<P>
In a therapy session, Barbara squirms when she sees a crackhead in a public 
service ad on TV; a Just Say No poster is enough to get her anxious. And this 
may always be so. 
</P>
<P>
Still, something has changed. Six months ago, her focus shifted from herself 
alone to her and her baby together. Cornelius was born and he seems for now a 
healthy child, with no immediate effects from the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara dotes. Is the baby cold? Is he hungry? Does he want to be held? She 
goes to parenting classes and has learned to do things she never did for Rubin, 
to wash a baby's ears and powder his skin and change his bedding. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors at the program say she finally is making progress through the stages 
of recovery. Next month they will help her find work. Then later, she will move 
from the program's shelter into an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be out on my own with my baby and a job, and I'll get Rubin from my 
mother and it'll be OK . . . ," Barbara says. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, there will be temptation: "I know one day I'll see all my old get-high 
buddies, and they'll say, 'Hey, we thought you was dead. Here, you want a hit?' 
</P>
<P>
"And then I'll say no, I'm off it. And they'll say, 'Get away from me, you 
square. Get away!' 
</P>
<P>
"And that will hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Colbert knows that much. The street will test her. Has she beaten the 
drug for good? Her answer is honest enough. Even after nine months in 
treatment, she is not sure. 
</P>
<P>
One night some weeks back, she dreamed she won the lottery. There was plenty of 
money to buy a big house. It was beautiful. She walked through. 
</P>
<P>
One room was nicer than the rest. It was set up for smoking, and on a round 
table were pieces of crack in a huge pile. 
</P>
<P>
When Barbara awoke from this dream, she was shaking. And the taste of the drug 
-- real as ever -- was fixed in her mouth. 
</P>

Researcher Anna M. Virtue contributed to this story.

COUPLE'S BOAT SUNK BY WHALES; 
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC 'UNFRIENDLY,' MAN SAYS AFTER 66 DAYS ON RAFT

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sailboat was on automatic pilot, and the two Butlers were asleep down 
below. They were awakened by a thump, then another. William went topside, and 
that's when he first saw the whales in the moonlight. Dozens of them, he 
remembers. Maybe even hundreds. Whales as far as he could see. 
</P>
<P>
At first, only a few nudged the boat, the 38-foot Siboney. He and his wife, 
Simone, stared into the blackness of the equatorial Pacific. They could hear 
the whooshing noises, the great animals' blowing. Some looked as big as the 
hull. What are we in the midst of? the Butlers asked each other. 
</P>
<P>
Then, one of the whales hit the boat hard on the port side. There was a crunch, 
and it sounded awful. William could hear water gushing. He raced below. Find 
the leak! Fix it! 
</P>
<P>
He began turning things over, pulling up the floorboards. But, in just a few 
minutes, there was water up to his waist. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the rope and inflate the life raft, he shouted. As the ocean surged into 
the Siboney, he radioed three futile Maydays. He tossed what he could into the 
inflatable raft -- some canned goods, some bottled water, some fishing gear. 
For heaven's sake, he threw in the video recorder. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Butlers were adrift in the vastness, off on what would become a 
66-day odyssey in the warm seas west of Central America. They were found only 
last Saturday by a Costa Rican coast guard boat on a routine fisheries patrol 
13 miles from land. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Miami couple -- sun-baked and exhausted -- remained hospitalized in 
the coastal city of Golfito. Each had lost more than 50 pounds. Simone's legs 
still felt like "cotton." William's back was covered with sores. His right hand 
was torn open, where he had been jabbed by the fish he grabbed for food. 
</P>
<P>
They told their story. "Oh, that Pacific can be very unfriendly," William said 
by telephone. "I don't like the habitat especially. And the distances, they're 
just too long. From now on, I'll be staying in the Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
It had been his lifelong dream to sail around the world. Simone, 52, was his 
reluctant companion. "He had wanted this since he was a boy, but I wasn't so 
much for it," she said. "My heart wasn't in it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted to Circle Globe 
</P>
<P>
William Butler, 60, retired engineer, is a champion sailor. He had taken his 
sailboat from Miami to Maine, Miami to Bermuda, Miami to Venezuela. This time, 
he meant to circle the globe. 
</P>
<P>
He had rigged the Siboney with the finest of electronic gear. He and his wife 
of seven years set out on April 14, and they crossed through the Panama Canal 
on May 23. Their next stop was to be Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The sea was serene, 1,200 nautical miles west-southwest of Panama. Dawn was but 
a few hours away when the sailboat and the whales crossed a momentous path. "I 
couldn't tell if there were 200 or 500 or what," William said. "Some were 
bigger than others, and the bigger ones were breathing hard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huddled on Raft 
</P>
<P>
In about 15 minutes, the Siboney was under. The Butlers huddled in the small 
raft, which was only about 6 feet long, just a bit shorter than William. At 
least, it had a canopy. The sun would be on them soon like yellow oil. 
</P>
<P>
They took stock of what they had. It wasn't so bad. In the frenzy, they had 
managed to escape with nine cans of food, two cans of crackers, a half jar of 
peanut butter, two 5-gallon jugs of water, five bottles of Evian. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, they had a water desalinator to keep up the supply. They had a 
compass and a flashlight and three flares. They had a knife and some line and a 
hook for fishing. They had two blankets to fight the cold nights. 
</P>
<P>
They had a Sony Walkman, which picked up a few stations and gave them clues to 
where they were drifting. Sometimes they heard Los Angeles, sometimes Texas, 
then Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"If God had given us a list and said this is what to take, we couldn't have 
done better," Simone said, calm now, the memories getting comfortable. "We 
prayed a lot. We weren't very good Catholics before, but we're better now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Lasted 4 Weeks 
</P>
<P>
They rationed their food into the most meager portions, but it lasted only four 
weeks and two days. In the meantime, they saw dozens of ships in the distance. 
None signaled them back. The raft was just a dot in the immensity. 
</P>
<P>
Hunger set in. They had been dragging the fishing line, but nothing bit the 
hook. Then, one afternoon, William simply reached out and snagged a huge turtle 
with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
They ate some of the meat and saved the rest as bait. Mostly, William caught 
what he called triggerfish. He had ditched the video recorder but kept its 
plastic cover. He fileted on it. 
</P>
<P>
The fish nourished him. He ate maybe two pounds a day. Simone was not so 
appetitive. She hates fish. The flesh was too chewy. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband would say: Do you want to die? Do you want to ever see your 
children again?" she recalled. "Then he would cut small pieces and tell me to 
imagine they were chicken." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharks Closed In 
</P>
<P>
At night, sharks closed in on them. They kicked them away. The sharks always 
returned. Sometimes, they slipped under the raft and tore at the bags of 
ballast. 
</P>
<P>
Storms hit. A few lasted days at a time. The raft tossed and lurched. The 
Butlers took refuge under the raft's canopy in their shredded clothes. Simone 
grew dizzy. William made her eat. 
</P>
<P>
Always, they hoped to see a rescue plane. William felt sure that his daughter, 
Sally, would notify the U.S. Coast Guard. She had. But there was no search. 
They did not know where to look. 
</P>
<P>
The worst of the ordeal came during the last three weeks. One afternoon, the 
sharks arrived early. They were in a fury, going after small fish that took 
shelter under the raft. Soon, porpoises joined the feeding. It lasted well into 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
During the darkness, something -- shark or porpoise -- ripped a two-inch gash 
in the raft. The ocean slowly seeped in as the Butlers struggled to bail it 
out. Only in the morning did William find the hole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sun Opened Sores 
</P>
<P>
He sealed the puncture with a repair kit, but the raft was never quite right 
again. Keeping it afloat was a constant task. The seawater burned into 
William's back, where the sun had opened sores. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they lost the fish hook. William improvised. He used his left hand to 
stir the bait in the sea. The triggerfish would swim up slowly and bite down. 
He speared them with his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
It was a depressing routine, day after day. Last Friday brought the worst of so 
many disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
They sighted a merchant ship. William fired the last flare. The ship appeared 
to see them. It signaled back. Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they just deserted us," Simone said. "Who knows what they thought? Or 
why they wouldn't get involved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heard Loud Engine 
</P>
<P>
But, in the deep despair of the very next day, they heard a loud engine. The 
coast guard vessel trudged toward them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so overjoyed we started crying and hugging," Simone said. "We were so 
overcome by joy we couldn't get out of the raft. Our energy had dissolved." 
</P>
<P>
The Butlers now hope to return to Miami in a few days. By air. They cannot 
imagine how they could have endured even a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, their long, harrowing sea journey -- extraordinary as it is -- is no 
record. In 1973, a British couple, Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, drifted 117 days 
after their sloop sank in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whale Attacks Uncommon 
</P>
<P>
That time, a whale, ironically enough, also did the damage. Whale attacks are 
very uncommon, though not unheard of, said Dr. Tom Dohl, a research biologist 
at the Long Marine Lab at the University of California at Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Byrne of the Cousteau Society in Los Angeles speculated that the Butlers' 
sailboat found itself within a large pod of sperm whales. "They go about 60 
feet," he said. "And they've been known to attack a boat." 
</P>
<P>

ARCHITECT OF FEINSTEIN'S BID FOR GOVERNOR HEATEDLY QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein's race for governor was torn asunder Monday as her longtime 
campaign manager up and quit with a snarling broadside saying the former San 
Francisco mayor lacked the resolve and gumption needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
In this state where success in politics usually requires years, if not a 
lifetime, of single-minded devotion, campaign manager Clinton Reilly said 
Feinstein is simply not giving it 100% with the 1990 election creeping up. 
Reilly criticized Feinstein for being unwilling to devote herself to an 
adequate campaign schedule or a fund-raising budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We make a 100% commitment to our clients and our campaigns. We expect our 
clients to give 100% in return. Dianne Feinstein has been unwilling to make 
this commitment," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco who has been sidelined for nearly 
six weeks recovering from a hysterectomy, was reportedly startled by Reilly's 
decision and by the angry tone of his remarks. But she vowed to continue on. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the relationship with Clint simply didn't work out," Feinstein said 
by way of reply. "This in no way deters my determination to continue my 
campaign for governor." 
</P>
<P>
Then she added her own barb: "In fact, it redoubles my commitment." 
</P>
<P>
The falling out of the candidate and the campaign manager, even where the 
partnership goes back half a dozen years through two previous successful 
campaigns, is not itself unheard of or necessarily evidence of insurmountable 
political problems. 
</P>
<P>
But Reilly's departure is a special blow in Feinstein's case. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Feinstein has been saddled from the start with a reputation as 
lacking the "fire in the belly" required to triumph in an epic-length 
gubernatorial run. Until just this year, for instance, she has stayed in San 
Francisco, aloof from gritty grass-roots organizing and free from the grueling 
day-after-day campaign travel that other candidates take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
To have this reputation ratified by her own campaign chief is sure to cause 
damage in her two-way primary election contest with Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp. A third Democrat, state Controller Gray Davis, is still considering 
whether to make the race. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly's sudden departure also will push Feinstein back almost to the start in 
the basics of assembling a credible campaign operation. More than just a 
manager, Reilly oversaw a "full-service" consulting business with 
responsibility for strategy, research, advertising and polling. 
</P>
<P>
By midday Monday, Feinstein was reported to be shopping actively for a 
replacement. But while there is no shortage of potential campaign managers 
eager for work in a race as prestigious as a run for governor of California, no 
manager is likely to match Reilly's close-up understanding of Feinstein's 
political base, her strengths, weaknesses and her views on issues. All of this 
stems from Reilly's managing her 1983 landslide reelection as mayor of San 
Francisco and her triumph over a recall attempt that same year, and from 
Reilly's long association with San Francisco politics. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, few political handlers are likely to be as prickly and 
temperamental as Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether this is the end of her or the best thing that has ever 
happened for her," one important fence-sitting Democrat from Los Angeles 
shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly has been associated with a large number of election races in California 
over the years. He is best known as the man who ran the most expensive campaign 
ever undertaken in a single state -- the $62-million insurance industry ballot 
initiative fight of last November. Reilly lost the fight over insurance 
initiatives but gained status as undoubtedly the highest-paid consultant in 
California history, along with one of its most volatile. 
</P>
<P>
He and Feinstein have previously disclosed tension in their relationship. 
Sources on Monday said the differences between the two had grown more and more 
heated, and had become deeply personal as well. 
</P>
<P>
In his resignation statement, Reilly said he had "strong differences with Mrs. 
Feinstein on how much money must be raised in order to win this election and 
how a winning campaign must be organized." He called the former mayor "a 
candidate with immense potential" but said, "to this moment, Mrs. Feinstein has 
been unwilling to commit to a schedule and a budget capable of electing her 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers, who is remaining part of the campaign, 
described the disagreements somewhat differently. "It wasn't a question of 
whether things should be done but how," she said.

RARE VIOLENCE SHATTERS QUIET OF STREET IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Angela Scott had just finished brushing her teeth when she heard "a horrible, 
pathetic scream" late Sunday night. She looked out the second-story window of 
her Beverly Hills mansion and saw a teen-age boy hunched over, sobbing on the 
lawn across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Scott's neighbors, Jose E. Menendez, 45, and his wife, Mary Louise 
(Kitty) Menendez, 44, had been shot to death inside their Mediterranean-style 
home on North Elm Street, the first murders in Beverly Hills this year, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's sons -- one 18, the other 21 years old -- had come home shortly 
before midnight to find their parents dead on the living room couch from 
multiple gunshot wounds. Scott, an 18-year North Elm Drive resident, watched 
from her bedroom window as one of the Menendez boys "cowered in a ball 
screaming, crying." 
</P>
<P>
"I was so scared," Scott, 44, said. "I couldn't sleep all night." 
</P>
<P>
The police activity that followed was a rare event for many residents in this 
posh neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
Squad cars flanked the tree-lined street, and gun-toting officers hid behind 
cars, neighbors said. A helicopter buzzed overhead. Residents who ventured 
outside were sternly warned by police to stay behind closed doors. Most of 
these Beverly Hills residents, who are accustomed to privacy behind electric 
security gates, tall hedges and ornate wrought iron fences, obeyed the orders, 
peering at the action through darkened bedroom and living room windows. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, who requested anonymity because she was frightened, said police 
told her it was dangerous outside but did not tell her that her new friend, 
Kitty Menendez, had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
"She was from New Jersey and was lonely out here," the neighbor said. "We went 
out to lunch twice. She was very nice. That's all I know." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, while a team of police investigators scoured the house for evidence, 
most residents stayed inside again, shunning questions about the family and 
their neighborhood. Many neighbors, it seems, knew little about the Menendezes, 
who for less than a year had lived in a mansion once leased by singer Elton 
John. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw my neighbors. I never talked to them. I don't even know what they 
looked like," said a gray-haired man who walked out the front door of a white 
mansion next door to the Menendez home. 
</P>
<P>
He did not hear the gunshots that killed the couple either. "I guess I'm a 
sound sleeper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Zlotlow, who lives directly behind the Menendez house, said he heard some 
"popping sounds" coming from across the alley. But the noise did not disrupt 
his viewing of the James Bond movie "The Spy Who Loved Me." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think anything of it. I didn't even think it could be gunshots, 
especially around here," Zlotlow said. "It was just pops from quite a distance. 
These houses are quite solid you know, and it really didn't sound that 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police said they had no motive in the shootings. Menendez was 
chairman of the board of LIVE Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a successful firm 
that buys video rights to feature films. He had previously headed RCA/Ariola 
records and U.S. operations for the Hertz Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez house was described by Scott as the "rental house" on the block, 
the former temporary home to a rock star and a "Saudi Arabian prince," she 
said. Elton John's publicist, Sara McMullen, said the singer leased the home in 
1987. In 1988 the lead guitarist for the Irish rock group U2, known as "The 
Edge," leased the home. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow police tape was wrapped around the perimeter of the tree-shaded mansion 
Monday. A six-foot tall security gate was pulled open, and a gold Mercedes 
sedan was parked on the curved driveway.

PHONE WORKERS TRICKLING BACK AMID SOME GROUSING OVER PACT 
</P>

<P>
Pacific Bell's work force trickled back Monday in the wake of the settlement of 
a 15-day strike by the company's 41,800 California workers. 
</P>
<P>
The slow trek to normalcy -- with from 10% of workers returning at some offices 
to more than half at others -- was not surprising. Under terms of a tentative 
agreement reached Sunday between phone company negotiators and representatives 
of the Communications Workers of America, employees have until Wednesday to 
check in by phone with their supervisors and until Friday to go back to their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
While many workers expressed relief at being able to return, there was some 
initial sentiment against ratification, based primarily on the health benefits 
called for in the new three-year contract, which is aimed at reducing Pacific 
Bell's medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
To keep operations running smoothly as the striking workers returned, many of 
the 17,000 managers who were assigned to temporary 12-hour-a-day duty as 
operators and technical workers during the strike remained on the job. But 
customers calling directory assistance in some areas still experienced delays; 
a tape-recorded message informed them that "although our strike has ended, we 
are still arranging for the return of our operators." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Pacific Bell nor CWA was able to make a systemwide estimate of the 
number of workers who showed up Monday. But Vira Milirides, a CWA spokeswoman 
in San Francisco, said she believed the majority of workers would return 
quickly because "people need that paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
The CWA paid no strike benefits during the walkout. The union's San Fernando 
Valley local spent more than $20,000 for groceries for needy members' families 
during the strike, according to the local's president, Ellen Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
In some offices, the working environment during the next few days figures to be 
strained as strikers mix with fill-in managers and an estimated 3,000 Pacific 
Bell workers who crossed picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative contract must still be ratified by the CWA membership, with 
mailed ballots to be returned to union headquarters by Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Many details of the settlement remained unknown Monday. Presidents of CWA 
locals will be briefed by the union's negotiating team within a week and will 
then make recommendations to members of their local. 
</P>
<P>
The new health plan, which would take effect in 1991, would create a network of 
doctors whose fees would be paid primarily by Pacific Bell. Employees who used 
the network would pay no more than 5% to 10% of the cost of treatment and 
nothing at all in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who went outside the network, however, would have to pay the first 
$1,000 of medical expenses per year out of their own pocket, up from the 
current deductible of $150. Workers subsequently would be reimbursed for 70% of 
the cost of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The company's idea -- common among corporations -- is to persuade workers to 
restrict themselves to a network of physicians who offer the company a discount 
in exchange for a high volume of business. 
</P>
<P>
But the presidents of two CWA locals said Monday they are upset that 
deductibles had been raised and that even those employees who used the new 
network would have to pay a small share of the cost. Under the old contract, 
Pacific Bell paid 100% of the cost for workers who used an approved health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's premature to make a prediction about ratification," said Valley CWA 
leader Edwards, "but I feel like the bargaining committee let me down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Vote Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Alice Alvarez, president of a CWA local covering Pasadena and East Los Angeles, 
said there was not enough information yet to make a judgment on the contract, 
but predicted that the membership's vote on ratification "will be close, either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard an awful lot of grumbling this morning," said Al Anderson, a 
communications technician who returned Monday to his job at a phone company 
switching control center in Beverly Hills. "I rather doubt" that the new 
contract will be ratified. "A lot of people have been saying that (after the 
ratification vote) we may have to go out again." 
</P>
<P>
The new contract gives workers increases in wages, bonuses and other payments 
that will raise salaries overall by 11% over three years. Pay currently ranges 
from about $228 a week for some operators to $650 for some skilled technicians. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unhappiness over health benefits, some union members also 
were concerned that the new contract contains no "amnesty" clause prohibiting 
Pacific Bell from disciplining strikers accused of illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
There were 450 "serious acts of sabotage or vandalism" during the walkout, 
according to the company, which said Sunday that rewards of $10,000 to $25,000 
for information leading to an arrest and conviction remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez on Monday said that a member of her union, who was arrested during the 
strike for allegedly spraying a can of foul-smelling nontoxic liquid at a 
strikebreaker, had been suspended by phone company officials hours after she 
returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell was the fourth of seven "Baby Bells" -- the regional holding 
companies set up in 1984 to take over the local phone business of American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph in the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit -- to reach 
a new contract with employees. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes continued Monday at Washington-based Bell Atlantic; NYNEX, which serves 
the Northeast; and Chicago-based Ameritech. Those three companies employ 
147,000 workers and serve 35 million customers.

LONG-TERM DEFICIT PLANS FACE DELAY; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS' SLOWNESS ON CURRENT BUDGET CITED BY DARMAN 
</P>

Prospects that the White House will be able to hammer out a long-term 
deficit-reduction plan with Congress later this year have narrowed 
substantially, and the effort may be postponed until early 1990, a Bush 
Administration official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that 
the dimmed outlook reflects the fact that congressional committees are taking 
more time than expected on the current year's budget plan, not that any snags 
have developed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Darman said he doubts that the delay will diminish the ability of the 
two sides to work out a significant agreement affecting fiscal 1991 and beyond. 
He said he still is optimistic that an accord can be reached after the current 
year's appropriations process is completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Momentum From Summer 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had hoped to hammer out a long-term deficit reduction plan 
with Congress this year to take advantage of momentum from talks held last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Those discussions were limited to the budget for fiscal year 1990, which begins 
Oct. 1. But, Darman said that "the people who would negotiate on fiscal 1991 
are the same people who are working on fiscal 1990, and I don't think it would 
be productive . . . to sit down on 1991" without them. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, it is likely that the longer-term talks will not begin until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Darman suggested also that, once the longer-term talks have produced an 
agreement, the Administration may seek to overhaul the Gramm-Rudman 
deficit-reduction law to close several major loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
The budget chief said that the biggest gap in the law is that it allows 
Congress to add to the budget without limit once it has passed the 
early-October deadlines that trigger automatic spending cuts if the deficit 
exceeds certain targets. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible changes, he said, involve "silly little" procedural 
requirements, such as one forcing the OMB to adhere to one set of statistics 
for the pace of economic growth even if the nation's actual growth rate turns 
out to be different, as it generally does. 
</P>
<P>
But Darman warned again that the Administration almost certainly would want to 
wait until the long-term budget agreement with Congress has been completed 
before starting any push to "reform" the Gramm-Rudman procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't favor reforming Gramm-Rudman until you have a credible (long-term 
deficit reduction) plan in effect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Darman made his comments as the OMB issued an updated report showing that 
fiscal 1990 appropriations are about on track and that no automatic cuts will 
be required under the Gramm-Rudman law, provided Congress lives up to the 
budget agreement it worked out with the White House earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$116-Billion Deficit Level 
</P>
<P>
The estimates show that, if the budget were totaled up now, the deficit for 
fiscal 1990 would be $116.2 billion. That would be $16.2 billion over the 
target set under Gramm-Rudman and $6.2 billion over the level at which 
automatic spending cuts are triggered. 
</P>
<P>
But, Darman said, if Congress continues to follow its budget agreement with the 
Administration as it approves remaining appropriations bills between now and 
Oct. 1, then it probably would come in just low enough to avoid automatic 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"They will try to find a way to spend every last dime" up to the level at which 
automatic spending cuts would be triggered, Darman said. "We are cutting it 
very close." 
</P>
<P>
The OMB report estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal 1989, which ends 
Sept. 30, probably will be near $167.5 billion, roughly $2.5 billion below 
earlier expectations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for Capital Gains 
</P>
<P>
Darman predicted that the Administration would be able to persuade Congress to 
approve Bush's proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profits 
from the sale of stocks, real estate or other assets. Leaders of key tax panels 
have hinted as much. 
</P>
<P>
The OMB's deficit projections are somewhat more optimistic than estimates 
published by the Congressional Budget Office last week. That agency forecast 
that the fiscal 1990 deficit was heading toward $141.5 billion, about $25.3 
billion more than predicted by the OMB. 
</P>
<P>
But Darman reiterated that the gap reflects different estimates by the two 
agencies of how rapidly the economy would grow, how high interest rates would 
be and how quickly the Administration could act to bail out troubled savings 
and loan associations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Automatic Spending Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Under the Gramm-Rudman legislation, Congress and the Administration must set a 
target of reducing the deficit to $100 billion in fiscal 1990. If they exceed 
that target by $10 billion or more, spending is slashed automatically -- by 
4.3% for military spending and 5.3% elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Partly as a warning, Monday's report contained some illustrations of the 
possible impact of such cuts on defense and non-defense programs, ranging from 
reductions in grants to needy college students to cutbacks in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress still has several more appropriations bills to enact and also must go 
through the process of reconciling differences between the outlays it has 
approved and the budget targets it set last spring. The lawmakers are scheduled 
to finish their work in mid-autumn.

More than 3,000 East Germans have managed to cross into Austria from Hungary

GORBACHEV'S HANDS-OFF POLICY TESTED IN POLAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's vow to let each Communist country chart its 
own future -- his unspoken promise to make the so-called Brezhnev Doctrine a 
policy of the past -- has been put to its toughest test yet by the decision in 
Poland to appoint a Solidarity leader as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet news media, in carefully worded reports highlighting the 
change in Soviet foreign policy, have consistently mirrored the Gorbachev line 
of tolerance and non-interference over the last several days of upheaval in 
Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Two newspapers went so far as to call the end of more than 40 years of 
Communist rule in Poland "realistic" and "normal" because, as one acknowledged, 
the Polish Communist Party "has become associated with crises, collapses and 
lack of confidence in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The Brezhnev Doctrine stemmed from Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's 
declaration in 1968, in justifying military intervention in Czechoslovakia, 
that the Soviet Union had a "sacred duty" to prevent other states from slipping 
away from socialism. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, Warsaw Pact states were put on notice that they had limited 
sovereignty and that the Kremlin saw itself as having the right to prevent 
deviation from the correct Communist Party line. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is the first Soviet leader since Brezhnev to publicly reject such 
thinking. He has said repeatedly, in visits to Eastern European countries over 
the last two years, that there is no single true path to socialism and that 
each country must respond to its own particular circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
But his hands-off policy was just words until a Solidarity activist, Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, was nominated Saturday to be prime minister of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago, the Soviet media certainly would have responded far more 
harshly to events in Poland, and we probably would have been predicting some 
kind of military intervention," a Western political analyst said Monday in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widening the Boundaries 
</P>
<P>
"This time, in choosing to sit by quietly while a Solidarity-led coalition 
takes over the Polish government, the Soviet Union is widening the boundaries 
of what is acceptable. The big unanswered question now is, just where do the 
new boundaries lie? But for the moment it is clear that Gorbachev is so 
involved in difficulties at home that he doesn't want unnecessary problems 
abroad." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily Pravda blamed the harshness of economic life in 
Poland for a loss of public faith in the Polish Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"The country is on the threshold of hyper-inflation," Pravda said Monday. 
"Endless jumps in wages, in combination with price hikes, will not accomplish 
anything without a noticeable boost in either production or foreign trade." 
</P>
<P>
Poland's economic shortcomings, Pravda said, make "increasingly realistic" the 
idea of a new ruling coalition led by Solidarity, the free trade union 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Difficult Period' 
</P>
<P>
"The Polish Communist Party," Pravda said, "is living through a very difficult 
period, perhaps the most difficult in its history. The party needs, as never 
before, to consolidate its ranks. All forces interested in the reform of the 
party should rally around." 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass, Radio Moscow and "Vremya," the main television 
news program, all reported the change in the Polish government simply and in a 
low-key manner. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a sign that the Soviet Communist Party does not want to appear to be 
hiding this news from the people, but nor does it want to make a big political 
statement about it," the Western analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
The most extensive commentary was published in Sunday's government newspaper 
Izvestia, which noted, as did Pravda, that the Communist Party's name in Poland 
"has become associated with crises, collapses and lack of confidence in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to 'New Things' 
</P>
<P>
"The party has ceased to rule and, let us be honest, it has gone into a kind of 
opposition," the newspaper's Warsaw correspondent observed. 
</P>
<P>
In a long profile of Mazowiecki, the correspondent said: "It is hard to write 
about a man who has not had the typical career of a party bureaucrat or been 
part of the power structure which for so long seemed unshakable. But we have to 
get used to new things." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the appointment of an outsider in the present circumstances was 
"natural," and added that the Polish Communist Party "intends to restructure 
itself and work out a new program that can attract support from millions." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "as far as the future is concerned, it is difficult to avoid the 
classic expression, 'Wait and see.' "

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Club-wielding riot police charged thousands of protesters Monday in Prague, 
beating dozens of them when they chanted demands for freedom on the 21st 
anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Security forces broke up a crowd of more than 2,000 people who sang the 
national anthem and cheered a group of young activists from Hungary who told 
them that neighboring East Bloc states should not have taken part in the 
invasion, which crushed the "Prague Spring" reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
But after hundreds of helmeted officers cleared central Wenceslas Square, more 
than 1,000 demonstrators tried to march across the River Vltava to the prime 
minister's office. 
</P>
<P>
Police blocked the medieval Charles Bridge, and two hours later, 1,500 
protesters regrouped in the square to jeer police and chant demands for 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds were seized. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of police vans, lights flashing and sirens wailing, brought in 
reinforcements to attack those who ignored orders broadcast over loudspeakers 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Police attacked a crew from the Austrian television network ORF, felling the 
cameraman with a karate blow, smashing the camera and cutting their cables. An 
ABC News crew was harassed and other foreign photojournalists' film was 
confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department urged Czechoslovakia to join other East 
Bloc states in granting wider freedom to its citizens. In Moscow, the Soviet 
Foreign Ministry said the 1968 invasion should be seen in the political context 
of its time. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators had gathered in Wenceslas Square for what was planned as a 
silent march. They broke into loud applause and raised their hands in 
V-for-victory signs when a group of Hungarian activists unfurled a banner of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
The banner, proclaiming "The Bolsheviks Came With Tanks, We Come With Flowers," 
was immediately torn down by plainclothes police. Soviet-led armor and troops 
of all East Bloc states except Romania poured into Czechoslovakia on the night 
of Aug. 20-21, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Long Live Freedom' 
</P>
<P>
The crowd chanted "Long live freedom!" and "Long live Poland!" -- showing how 
reform in other East Bloc states is encouraging demands for liberalization in 
Czechoslovakia, where hard-line Communist politics have prevailed since the 
1968 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Police, backed by Communist Party militia in battle fatigues, warned the 
demonstrators to disperse about 30 minutes after protesters started gathering, 
and then moved in. 
</P>
<P>
Rows of police with raised night sticks stood across the big square while the 
crowd dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were responding to a call by the Charter 77 human rights 
group and eight other independent groups for the peaceful protest to mark the 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Many shouted their admiration for the country's leading dissident, Vaclav 
Havel, and ousted Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek. Dubcek, who 
spearheaded the "Prague Spring" reform movement, was later drummed out of 
office and the party. He now lives as a pensioner in Bratislava. 
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated film from several Western journalists and several tourists, 
including East Germans who photographed detentions. 
</P>
<P>
The Prague government has come in for severe international criticism following 
police brutality at previous demonstrations. The Communist leadership waged a 
campaign ahead of the anniversary vowing it would break up any demonstrations. 
It sticks firmly by its defense of the 1968 invasion as necessary to spare 
Czechoslovakia from counterrevolution. 
</P>
<P>
Prague Radio reported that "a group of hooligans met today in the center of 
Prague and used the pretext of the anniversary for demonstrations. Police 
appealed for them to disperse and then restored order." 
</P>
<P>
The authorities reacted angrily to last week's condemnation of the invasion by 
the Polish Parliament and the Hungarian Communist Party and government. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people were detained Sunday in Wenceslas Square when they sought 
to stage another silent march for political reform. More than 10,000 people 
stunned the authorities by marching through Prague during last year's 20th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Police placed Charter 77 spokespersons Dana Nemcova and Tomas Hradilek under 
house arrest. The whereabouts of most other leading dissidents were unknown. 
Many have left the capital during the anniversary after police warned them to 
do so, but others were believed to have been detained.

NAACP OFFICE HIT BY GAS BOMB; 8 HURT

<P>
A package containing what appeared to be a tear-gas bomb was mailed to the 
Southeastern regional headquarters of the NAACP and injured eight people when 
it spewed gas throughout an office building. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leaders denounced the attack as apparently racist, and federal 
officials said they will investigate to see if civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
A caustic gas, "similar to tear gas," spread from the NAACP office through 
air-conditioning ducts into nearby offices in the two-story building just 
southwest of downtown Atlanta, Assistant Fire Chief Walter Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Children Hurt 
</P>
<P>
The eight injured people, taken to two downtown hospitals, included two 
children, ages 4 months and 12 years. No one was seriously hurt, spokesmen at 
Grady Memorial Hospital and Georgia Baptist Medical Center said. At least five 
of the injured were able to go home within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Two staff members in the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
office when the bomb went off, Regional Executive Director Earl T. Shinhoster 
and secretary Murlene Murray, fled and suffered only burning sensations in 
their eyes and throats, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a terrible experience," she added. "We've never experienced 
anything like this before in the 20 years I've worked here." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very evil and dastardly act," Shinhoster said. "I don't know why 
anyone would want to try to hurt innocent people like this." 
</P>
<P>
The package, "no bigger than a hat box," arrived by Postal Service "priority 
mail," Shinhoster said. It was addressed to the NAACP and not to anyone in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
The return address listed a law office and a location, "but I'm sure it was 
fictitious," Murray said. She did not recall a specific name on the return 
address. 
</P>
<P>
Shinhoster said that he and Murray opened the package just after noon and 
immediately saw sparks. Two loud pops were then heard, and a cylinder in the 
package began emitting a white-yellow caustic smoke, Shinhoster said. The 
package remained largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Postal Service, the FBI, the city police and the city arson 
squad were investigating, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) was in the neighborhood speaking to a community group 
when he heard about the incident and went to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time something like this would come to the NAACP office, you have to 
believe it's racially motivated," Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights 
movement, said.

The bodies of Texas congressman Mickey Leland and eight other Americans killed 
Aug. 7 in a plane crash will arrive in the United States on Wednesday, U.S. and 
Ethiopian officials said Monday. 
</P>

Leland and 15 others died when the Twin Otter plane taking them to an Ethiopian 
refugee camp flew into a mountain in bad weather. It took searchers a week to 
find the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the remains of 
the victims are being flown from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa to 
Frankfurt, West Germany, then on to Andrews Air Force Base just outside 
Washington. 
</P>

Leland, a Democrat, had represented a Houston district since 1978 and was 
chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger.

Israel's Supreme Court barred a Jewish women's group Monday from chanting 
prayers or reading the Bible aloud at Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's 
holiest site. 
</P>
<P>
Ultra-Orthodox men and women have complained about the Women of the Wall group, 
which prays once a month at the Western Wall, a remnant of the Second Temple 
that is also known as the Wailing Wall. 
</P>
<P>
They say that, under Jewish law, women worshipers should not be heard in the 
presence of men. Female police officers dragged a dozen praying women from the 
wall earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The court order remains in effect until a final hearing in December on the 
right of women to hold collective prayers at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will consider also whether the women may don prayer shawls worn by 
men or read from the biblical Torah scroll.

MAINTENANCE AN ISSUE IN IOWA BLAST; 
</P>
<P>
PREVENTIVE CARE CALLED POOR; NAVY EMBARRASSMENT SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy investigation of the battleship Iowa explosion that killed 47 sailors 
has disclosed that the crew failed to follow maintenance procedures designed to 
prevent breakdowns in the gun turret that blew up, Pentagon sources said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The preventive maintenance just wasn't done," said one defense official 
familiar with what he called the "embarrassing" findings of the Navy 
investigators. "The Navy is going to have some explaining to do when this comes 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokesman Brent Baker Monday refused to confirm or deny the allegations, 
which were made by former Iowa crew members and Pentagon officials. "All those 
things will be gone into in the report," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Completed 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa report has been completed, but Pentagon officials said it will not be 
made public until after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney returns from his vacation 
this weekend to read it. The thick document may be released on Aug. 30, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
What is not known is whether faulty maintenance caused the explosion. There are 
scores of systems that help hoist the 16-inch projectiles and bundles of powder 
-- which have a combined weight of 3,355 pounds -- from the depths of the 
battleship to the gun. 
</P>
<P>
One Navy official said that the No. 2 turret's guns passed their pre-firing 
checks before the explosion, indicating that, if any maintenance jobs remained 
undone, they did not keep the systems from being operational. But he added that 
maintaining such complicated systems by the book is a constant struggle and 
there could have been gaps not discovered in pre-firing checks and earlier 
inspections, which the Iowa passed. 
</P>
<P>
Former Iowa crewmen said that the Navy issued cards covering gun maintenance, 
such as what kind of grease to use where and how to discover and fix hydraulic 
leaks. They said some of the sailors in the No. 2 turret were not fully 
qualified to do their assigned jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokesman Baker said the service would have no comment in advance of its 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the No. 2 turret blew up on April 19, Capt. Fred P. Moosally of the 
Iowa turned to a visiting admiral and said: "Hey, this is my best crew coming 
up here, Admiral. You've got to watch these guys fire." In the next moments, 
the battleship shuddered from three explosions below decks, and fire leaped 
from the turret. 
</P>
<P>
Moosally said at a press conference on April 23 that supervision in the turret 
was outstanding. Senior Chief Petty Officer Reginald Ziegler paid "meticulous 
attention to detail" in the turret, the skipper said. "If somebody screwed up 
training, he made them start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
In one track of the investigation, Navy experts under Rear Adm. Richard D. 
Milligan have tried to pinpoint the mechanical cause of the explosion, checking 
maintenance logs, crew training and powder from the same batch that apparently 
exploded prematurely. They have found that the powder apparently ignited when 
the gun's breech was still open, causing flames to shoot back into the turret, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Sabotage Probed 
</P>
<P>
In a second track, agents in the Naval Investigative Service under Rear Adm. 
Ted Gordon have been working with the FBI on possible non-mechanical causes, 
such as sabotage. As part of this investigation, they explored the possibility 
that Iowa sailor Clayton M. Hartwig was so despondent over his rejection by two 
shipmates that he blew up the turret to kill himself. Hartwig died in the 
fireball. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa Gunner's Mate Kendall L. Truitt, whom Hartwig once considered his closest 
friend, was the beneficiary on Hartwig's $100,000 life insurance policy. Truitt 
said Hartwig talked of committing suicide "but it wasn't very serious. I think 
we all talk about suicide at least once in our life."

RELIGIOUS TENETS NOT AN EXEMPTION FROM IMMIGRATION ACT, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Religious grounds cannot be used to protect employers who knowingly hire 
undocumented workers in violation of U.S. immigration laws, a federal judge in 
Los Angeles ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing a suit filed by the American Friends Service Committee, commonly 
known as the Quakers, U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman said he was not 
persuaded by an argument that the immigration laws prevent the religion from 
fulfilling its tenet to befriend and help all "strangers," whoever they may be. 
</P>
<P>
"The court is of the opinion that the government should prevail and will 
prevail and I'll issue a written opinion within a few days," said U.S. District 
Judge James M. Ideman. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 organizations and individuals -- ranging from the United Methodist 
Church and the Commission of Social Action of Reform Judaism to the Sisters of 
Mercy of Burlingame and the Southern California Ecumenical Council -- joined in 
filing friend-of-the court briefs supporting the Quakers. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys responded that if the Friends committee were 
granted the exemption, it would undermine the 1986 Immigration Reform and 
Control Act because Congress had determined the primary reason aliens came to 
this country was to seek work. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Holguin, an attorney from the National Center for Immigrants' Rights 
representing the Quakers, said the decision to dismiss the suit would be 
appealed to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"This was just the first step in a long process," Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1917 
</P>
<P>
The American Friends Service Committee is a social action group created in 1917 
by members of the Religious Society of Friends in Philadelphia, but is 
independent of the Quaker church itself. Headquartered in Philadelphia, it has 
local offices in Pasadena, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947 for 
its efforts to aid war refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has objected to the 1986 immigration law, which requires 
employers to determine whether job seekers are authorized to work in the United 
States. The law forbids employers to hire those who are unable or unwilling to 
produce such documentation. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service can seek criminal penalties against 
employers who hire illegal aliens and levy fines of up to $10,000 for each 
illegal worker on the employer's payroll. To date, more than 720 employers have 
been fined. 
</P>
<P>
When the Friends committee filed suit nine months ago, the group's national 
chairman, Stephen G. Cary, said the organization was not complying with the 
law. Thus far, no penalties have been imposed on the organization. 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Holguin said if the Friends committee obeyed the law, it would be 
participating in "driving undocumented immigrants and refugees out of the 
United States by depriving them of employment and, therefore, the ability to 
obtain the basic necessities of life." 
</P>
<P>
The committee sought a ruling that obeying the law would violate the Free 
Exercise Clause of the 1st Amendment to the Constitution. The group asserted 
that if the law were enforced, it would coerce them "to engage in acts 
violative and repugnant to their sincerely held, profound religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Wendtland, a Justice Department lawyer who argued the government's case, 
declined to comment on Ideman's decision to dismiss the suit. 
</P>
<P>
But in court, Wendtland argued that complying with the law would not have a 
severe impact on the Friends committee because there were other ways they could 
help undocumented immigrants, such as giving them free food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
She also asserted that even if the court determined there was a serious impact, 
there was "a compelling state interest justifying the burden imposed on the 
exercise of religious freedom." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intent of Congress 
</P>
<P>
Wendtland said Congress had made a determination that the prospect of 
employment was "the magnet" that drew immigrants here and that it would be 
inappropriate for Judge Ideman to scrutinize what Congress had done. 
</P>
<P>
Ideman apparently agreed with the government, for at one point he told Holguin: 
"Who is this court to second guess Congress? . . . They are far more able to 
conduct legislative fact-finding than this court." 
</P>
<P>
Holguin noted that Congress had provided for certain exemptions to the 1986 
law, such as those granted to some farm laborers and to "casual employees," 
including some domestic workers and persons with specialized skills who are 
allowed to work for brief periods in the U.S. film industry.

FBI JOINS PROBE OF VIET WRITER'S SHOOTING

<P>
Sheriff's investigators backed by the FBI Monday focused on a political motive 
for the shooting of internationally known Vietnamese writer Doan Van Toai, a 
man whose views have angered people of both ideological extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Toai, in serious but stable condition at a Fresno hospital, underwent 
additional surgery Monday for reconstruction of his jaw. He was shot three 
times -- once in the face and twice in the torso -- Saturday morning as he 
walked home from a shopping center. Two men, described by witnesses as Asians 
driving a brown Pontiac station wagon, are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
Associates of Toai blamed the shooting on far-right extremists from the 
Vietnamese refugee community who have accused Toai of supporting communism in 
his homeland. The accusations, which associates maintain are unfair and 
malicious, stem from Toai's recent writings and speeches in favor of renewed 
diplomatic relations with Vietnam as a way to encourage economic and political 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"We favor creating dialogue with the Vietnamese government as a way to push for 
more reform, but whoever has contact, they call communists," said Vinh Ngo, who 
works with Toai for the Institute for Democracy in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"We might go a different path from them, but it doesn't mean we are the puppets 
of communism." 
</P>
<P>
Ngo said he believes the gunmen bent on assassinating Toai were watching him 
and followed him to the busy residential street where he was gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI, which originally investigated threats against Toai five years ago, has 
joined the Fresno case to share intelligence on groups active in the Vietnamese 
community. 
</P>
<P>
George Vinson, agent in charge of the Fresno office, said investigators were 
searching for evidence that might link the shooting to other attacks on 
Vietnamese activists that have occurred in Orange County in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into whether a group in the Vietnamese community attempted to 
assassinate him for political reasons," Vinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, right-wing groups have claimed responsibility for arson fires, 
shootings and other attacks on refugees who favor diplomatic ties with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The Fresno County Sheriff's Department emphasized that it is continuing to 
investigate a range of possible motives, pointing to a surge in Asian gangs, 
drive-by shootings and armed robberies involving Asians in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Anger at Toai, even after the shooting, remained high-pitched among the 
staunchly anti-communist segments of Fresno's Vietnamese community, which 
numbers about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Several Vietnamese merchants who asked not to be identified said they believe 
Toai secretly supported the communist regime. They point to his anti-war 
protest activities as a student in the 1960s and '70s, saying he damaged the 
U.S. military effort. 
</P>
<P>
Toai was later imprisoned by the Vietnamese regime and his novels since have 
been widely regarded as anti-communist. 
</P>
<P>
Anh Tam, editor of a locally produced Vietnamese newspaper, said Toai's enemies 
became especially incensed after one of Toai's editorials was translated 
incorrectly into Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
In the editorial, Toai advocated resettling prisoners in Vietnamese 
re-education camps to the United States but said those who chose to stay in 
Vietnam should be paid a compensation. The incorrect translation, which was 
widely distributed in the Vietnamese refugee community, suggested that the 
United States should not allow the prisoners to be resettled in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Toai's associates suggest the incorrect translation was a deliberate effort to 
stir hatred against the author.

WOMAN TELLS OF HER SEXUAL AFFAIR WITH RAY BUCKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, Associated Press Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who says she had a sexual affair with Ray Buckey came forward in his 
child molestation trial Monday and testified that she saw "no possibility" that 
he could have molested children. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Dusky, 37, said she and Buckey had sexual relations after they met at a 
health and science fair in Reno in November, 1982. She said they shared an 
interest in so-called pyramid power and worked together at booths selling wire 
pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
The night after they met, Dusky said, she and Buckey drove to Lake Tahoe 
together and checked into a motel called the Fantasy Inn. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a heart-shaped bathtub and a round bed and it was all in red velour," 
she said. "It was a very beautiful room." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seemed Inexperienced 
</P>
<P>
She said she and Buckey took a bubble bath together, then went to bed. Although 
she said the then-23-year-old Buckey seemed inexperienced, their sexual 
activity was normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there anything unhealthy or bizarre about your relations with Raymond 
Buckey?" asked defense attorney Danny Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Dusky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there anything that indicated he would prefer to have sex with little 
children?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 
conspiracy and 64 counts of child molestation which are alleged to have 
occurred at the family-owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Dusky, of Butte, Mont., used her maiden name in testifying, She is married, has 
two children and grandchildren and said she wants to protect her family from 
publicity. She was divorced from her first husband when she met Buckey, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During her Nevada weekend with Buckey, Dusky said, they went to Pyramid Lake 
with a minister who baptized her as she stepped naked into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be baptized as I came into the world," she said of her nudity. " . 
. . I wanted to live my life according to Christ's will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stayed at Apartment 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after the Nevada encounter, she said, she visited Buckey in 
California and stayed at his apartment in his family's home where their sexual 
relationship continued. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she said Buckey took her to visit the McMartin Pre-School where 
she saw children run with outstretched arms to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was amazed at the love that was exchanged between them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see or hear anything that would make you think that Ray Buckey was a 
person capable of molesting children?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No possibility," Dusky said. 
</P>
<P>
During their affair, she said, she realized that Buckey didn't wear underwear 
-- a matter that has been stressed by the prosecution.

WATER FLOWING AGAIN AS CREWS FIX DAMAGED L.A. AQUEDUCT

Flash-flood damage to the aqueduct that supplies Los Angeles with 75% of its 
water was repaired ahead of schedule, and water has resumed flowing, officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Water began moving through the Los Angeles Aqueduct about 8 p.m. Saturday after 
extensive repair work, said Mindy Berman, a Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Crews laboring around the clock completed the repairs about three days ahead of 
schedule, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of water flowing through the damaged area will increase over several 
days to its previous rate of about 600 cubic feet per second, aqueduct engineer 
Dennis Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost of $800,000 
</P>
<P>
Repairs took 12 days and costs are expected to total about $800,000, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They replaced about 800 linear feet of concrete panels on the sides of the 
aqueduct. That's pretty fast work," said Jay Malinowski, a Metropolitan Water 
District spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
An Aug. 8 flash flood on Olancha Creek dumped tons of debris into a two-mile 
stretch of the aqueduct 180 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Another storm on Aug. 10 soaked the ground, causing parts of the concrete 
lining to buckle along an 800-foot stretch of the aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the water that would have flowed through the damaged section of the 
338-mile aqueduct was held in Crowley Lake north of Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
The new flow of water was scheduled to reach Bouquet Reservoir, the first of 
several local reservoirs, north of Los Angeles near California 14, late Monday 
or early today, Malinowski said.

DEBATE CONTINUES ON FUTURE OF BESIEGED TRAUMA SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Los Angeles County trauma system was set up in 1983, private hospitals 
battled hard and even sued to be included in the prestigious network, regarded 
as the crown jewel of the county's emergency services program. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the 10th trauma center of the original 23 permanently bowed out of 
the system. On busy nights, half a dozen of the remaining ones are full and 
temporarily closed. As a result, millions of people living in wide swaths of 
the county are served by no trauma center at all or by one that may well have 
no space when they need care. 
</P>
<P>
Like trauma systems in many other parts of the country, the one here -- what is 
left of it -- is fighting for its life. 
</P>
<P>
Several more hospitals may yet bail out. Temporary closures due to overload are 
way up over last year -- "more than 1,000%" at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, for 
example, according to statistics compiled by Alan Cowen, chief of paramedics 
for the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that now is the time to evaluate the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the local trauma network before allocating more money to 
revive it. Some favor redrawing the boundaries for hospital trauma service 
areas or setting new medical criteria for which patients are taken to the 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
But the chairman of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services 
Commission, Dr. Stephen L. Michel, warned that any tinkering "is fraught with 
danger and may gut the whole system." He and many others maintain that the 
trauma system's only salvation lies in increased public funding. The commission 
is expected to present its recommendations today to the county Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, growing numbers of trauma patients are not getting to a trauma 
center at all. Or they are making it just in the nick of time due to increased 
used of helicopters or because "paramedics are busting their little wheels to 
make it all the way across town to an open trauma center," said Virginia 
Price-Hastings, the county health official in charge of emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Children Hit by Car 
</P>
<P>
For example, when two children were mowed down by a drunk driver in 
South-Central Los Angeles one day last month, the trauma center less than 10 
minutes away was already full and closed to new patients. After waiting 15 
minutes for an ambulance, the children -- one with tire marks across his chest 
and plummeting blood pressure -- had to wait again for a helicopter to be 
summoned to fly them to a pediatric trauma center at Childrens Hospital in 
Hollywood, recounted Los Angeles city paramedic Becky Hegwar. 
</P>
<P>
"They probably made it within the hour, but barely," Hegwar said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brian Johnston, an emergency physician at White Memorial Medical Center in 
East Los Angeles, pointed to the case of a young motorcyclist who had crashed 
into an automobile at a speed upward of 100 m.p.h. It was a classic trauma 
case, he said, but for lack of a nearby trauma bed, the patient was brought to 
White's emergency room where, fortunately, a surgeon was on hand to quickly 
operate, saving the patient. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a trauma center, emergency rooms are not required to have a surgeon and 
anesthesiologist on the premises ready to operate, as well as a battery of 
other specialists like orthopedists and neurosurgeons available within 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
This special staffing requirement at trauma centers is designed to ensure quick 
surgical capability for those patients who are bleeding from injuries to their 
vital organs like the brain, lungs, heart and the accompanying vascular system. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, about 60% of the county's serious trauma injuries are caused by 
traffic accidents, health officials say. The rest stem from violent crimes such 
as stab or gunshot wounds or from work-related injuries such as falls from 
great heights on construction sites or entanglements with factory machinery. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, trauma patients bleed. They bleed into their heads, into their 
chests, into their abdomens," according to Paula Woo, former trauma coordinator 
for Presbyterian InterCommunity Hospital in Whittier which closed its trauma 
center Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency department can provide high-tech equipment, specialized 
emergency physicians, qualified nurses who can figure out what the problem 
probably is," she continued. But, "they can't fix it." Trauma centers are 
designed to do that. 
</P>
<P>
When the trauma system was established in Los Angeles County, it was designed 
so that no point in the county would be more than 20 minutes' distance from one 
of 23 trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
The system was very popular. As Price-Hastings from the county Health Service 
Department pointed out: "People that drive Jaguars bleed at the same rate as 
people that walk. So, it is a health care impact on every single one of us." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials leaped at what they thought would be a prime opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wanted to be a trauma center for the same reason everybody wants to 
do everything else -- money," Dr. Mike Vitullo, chief of emergency room 
physicians at Midway Hospital Medical Center, recently recalled during 
testimony before the county Emergency Medical Services Commission. "Everybody 
thought it was going to be a lot of money coming into the hospital. All these 
paid patients." 
</P>
<P>
But as it turned out, most trauma centers lost money at a time when hospitals 
were increasingly unwilling to absorb the losses because they were being 
squeezed by new government and insurance health care cost controls. Worse, many 
surgeons and other specialists who staffed the trauma centers revolted when 
they discovered that so many patients could not pay their doctor bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, nobody wants to be a trauma center," Vitullo concluded. 
</P>
<P>
With all the holes in the network, Los Angles County no longer has an 
integrated trauma system, Price-Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Served by Centers 
</P>
<P>
Most of the San Gabriel Valley, a large section of the East San Fernando Valley 
and the beach cities and inland area surrounding Los Angeles International 
Airport are no longer served by trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
At most times of the day, Price-Hastings said, there is no hope -- barring a 
helicopter -- that these people will be able to get one of the remaining trauma 
centers within the county-mandated 20-minute transport time. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, if it is 2 o'clock in the morning -- if you can plan your trauma -- 
you will be able to get there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that the system needs all 23 trauma centers to be effective, 
Price-Hastings added. In fact, she said it is generally agreed that Los Angeles 
County designated too many trauma centers in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen would be enough, she said, if they were properly distributed. But as 
it stands, she said, they are in the "wrong places." 
</P>
<P>
Cowen of the city Fire Department said the trauma system might actually be 
better off without the private hospitals, which, he said, continually hold the 
county "hostage" to their demands by threatening to pull out. He suggested 
relying upon the county's four public hospitals and UCLA Medical Center for all 
trauma care and using helicopters much more extensively for patient 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the United Paramedics of Los Angeles, Fred Hurtado, has urged 
that the county review its medical guidelines that dictate what symptoms 
require trauma treatment. He said the guidelines are so loose that they have 
allowed the public to use scarce ambulances as a "taxi service" in 
non-emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Morales, an emergency physician at County-USC Medical Center, has 
challenged the fundamental idea that trauma centers are more effective than 
well-equipped emergency rooms in saving lives. He has co-authored a report that 
studied automobile accident death rates statewide and concluded that trauma 
centers in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties do not appear to have 
reduced motor vehicle mortality, compared to the rest of the state where there 
are no trauma systems. 
</P>
<P>
"We had expected our death rates in these three counties would be lower, 
coincident with the trauma centers," he said. He questioned whether trauma 
centers are not built on a foundation of "fluff" and pointed out that Los 
Angeles County has done no outcome studies to assess the effectiveness of the 
local trauma system to date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Let's Get Some Data' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time to say, 'Whoa, let's get some data,' " Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
Price-Hastings acknowledged that there have been no trauma outcome studies done 
in Los Angeles so far but that attempts are under way. 
</P>
<P>
Orange and San Diego counties have conducted comprehensive outcome studies 
showing trauma centers there have substantially reduced deaths, according to a 
nationwide review of trauma centers in 1988 by the Dade County Trauma Task 
Force in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Howard Champion, a leading proponent of trauma care and chief of trauma 
services at Washington Center Hospital in the nation's capital, said that in 
San Diego and elsewhere across the country, good data has been collected 
documenting how trauma centers have dramatically reduced the number of patients 
who, before the advent of trauma centers, died as a result of delayed or 
inappropriate care. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite this "strong documentation" and the fact that trauma is the 
leading cause of death for people under the age of 38, Champion said "trauma 
systems are in trouble" across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Trauma tends to claim as its victims a young, (medically) uninsured 
population, and nobody is picking up the bill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One health care economist, Greg Bishop with the Trauma Resource Project in 
Irvine, has pointed out that in California a major part of the financial 
dilemma for trauma centers is that while automobile accidents are responsible 
for about two-thirds of all patients sent to trauma centers, less than 10% of 
trauma center costs are reimbursed by automobile insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other states, he said there is no requirement in California that a 
motorist carry medical insurance as part of his auto policy. New York requires 
motorists to carry a minimum $50,000 in medical insurance and Colorado requires 
$135,000, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Automobile Insurance Changes 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said he is hopeful that changes in automobile insurance under way in 
Sacramento will ultimately provide a greater source of funding to the state's 
trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
Public subsidies of the trauma network would probably provide the quickest 
salvation, but in California there is fierce competition among health care 
programs for money. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, Gov. George Deukmejian blue-penciled $100 million 
earmarked in the Legislature's budget for trauma and emergency services 
statewide. Health officials are hopeful that money raised through the recent 
passage of Proposition 99, which boosted taxes on tobacco products, will 
eventually be released to the counties. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, there are many other health care programs, including local mental 
health services, that can be expected to stake a claim to the money. David 
Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California, said 
he expects that there will be no subsidies for private trauma centers without a 
big battle. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the council of about 10 hospitals in 1987 showed the average loss 
per trauma patient was $4,386 among those classified as having no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

More than 1 million county residents live farther than 20 minutes from a trauma 
center, according to county health officials. The gray shaded area in the map

COVER-UP BY POLICE IN CRASH DEATH ALLEGED BY EX-OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Torrance police officer testified Monday that it was common knowledge 
within the Police Department that investigators covered up for an off-duty 
police sergeant, even though they believed that he was drunk and was to blame 
for a 1984 traffic accident that killed a San Pedro teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Former officer Timothy Pappas also told a Los Angeles Superior Court jury that 
supervisors in the county's third-largest police department condoned 
drunkenness and other abuses, including unjustified arrests of blacks who 
ventured into the mostly white city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrongful-Death Suit 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came near the end of the fourth week of trial of a wrongful-death 
lawsuit filed by John Rastello of San Pedro, whose son, Kelly, died in the 1984 
collision with Sgt. Rollo Green. The lawsuit claims that Green was drunk when 
he turned illegally in front of the 19-year-old and that fellow officers 
covered up Green's culpability as part of a pattern of concealing abuses by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance officials say they investigated the case impartially and found that 
Rastello caused the accident by speeding. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas' testimony could be critical because he is the first witness from within 
the department to corroborate the coverup allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In his brief appearance, Pappas pictured himself as a straight shooter who was 
ostracized by fellow officers and superiors for doing things by the book. But 
defense lawyers painted Pappas, 27, as a troubled cop with a motivation to get 
back at the Torrance Police Department: He had been punished five times for 
misconduct during his five-year career and was fired last December for 
allegedly covering up the facts of an incident in which he shot a man. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas was not at the scene of the fatal crash but he told the jury that there 
was talk around the department afterward of a coverup. 
</P>
<P>
"At the accident scene it was a known fact that Rollo Green was intoxicated," 
Pappas testified, "and that they wanted to get him out of there as soon as they 
could. And that they wanted a Deuce Team (anti-drunk-driving team) there to 
back them up to say that he had been checked. And that they didn't want a 
blood-alcohol test because they knew it would be over 0.10 (the legal standard 
for intoxication)." 
</P>
<P>
In earlier testimony, Officer Daniel Metzger, a drunk-driving specialist, 
testifed that he checked Green on the night of the accident and found that, 
although the sergeant had been drinking, he was not drunk. Green was driven 
home, not arrested, and no blood-alcohol test was ever performed, according to 
previous witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas testified that one of those at the crash scene, Officer Timothy 
Thornton, came to him and admitted that he lied in a sworn statement about the 
case taken by lawyers for John Rastello. Thornton told him that the 
drunk-driving team had been called to cover for Green and that Green, then an 
18-year police veteran, was driven home for his own protection, Pappas told the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton and his lawyer could not be reached for comment. Thornton is the key 
witness against Pappas in a pending criminal case in which Pappas is accused of 
obstructing justice and falsely accusing another of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas claimed that Torrance police officers knew they could stay out of 
trouble if they drank in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was known that if you were in the city of Torrance you would be safe," 
Pappas said. If officers were pulled over while driving, "it would be OK. At 
the most you would be driven home." 
</P>
<P>
Pappas also testified that training officers encouraged abuses, such as 
targeting blacks for arrest when they came to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiff's attorney, Browne Greene, tried to explore the issue of 
discrimination further, but Judge Abby Soven said it was beyond the scope of 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted later, Deputy Police Chief Jim Popp said, "We treat all people alike, 
depending on their actions, not their color." 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, lawyers for the city attacked Pappas' credibility, 
pointing out that he was fired last year for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Soven would not permit detailed questions about the incident, in which Pappas 
allegedly lied to justify his shooting in May, 1988, of an unarmed man, Patrick 
J. Coyle.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLAZE KILLS MAN IN BOARDED-UP HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man died of smoke inhalation and another was in intensive care Monday after 
a fire in the boarded-up house in Eagle Rock where they were sleeping, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that they might have set fire to one end of the house to keep warm 
and slept on the other side," said Detective John Munguia. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started on a porch on the opposite side. Because the windows were 
boarded, the smoke had no where to escape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were called to the house on Eagle Rock Boulevard about 5 a.m. but 
did not discover the men until several hours later, Munguia said. The two 
unidentified victims, between 25 and 30 years old, apparently were transients, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor was in the intensive care unit at Glendale Memorial Hospital.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRA TO SUE BISTRO OWNERS OVER LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has 
voted to take legal action for repayment of a controversial $250,000 loan to 
the owners of the downtown Stock Exchange nightclub, according to the CRA's 
chief deputy administrator, Judy Broverman. 
</P>
<P>
Broverman said Monday that the CRA board voted to sue two owners of the club 
who had pledged personal assets against the loan, which she said came due at 
the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the owners, Brian Potashnik, said that the CRA had reneged on its 
commitment to lend $1.5 million to renovate the historic Spring Street building 
where the club is located. 
</P>
<P>
Potashnik said the $250,000 represented an advance on the loan. After the CRA 
failed to lend the rest of the money, Potashnik said building owners stopped 
repayment of the $250,000 on the advice of their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA was harshly criticized by the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, 
downtown homeless advocacy groups and at least two members of the City Council, 
Zev Yaroslavsky and Ernani Bernardi, for lending public money to a fancy 
nightclub instead of using the money to house and feed poor people. 
</P>
<P>
CRA officials said the loan was part of an effort to rehabilitate the old 
Pacific Stock Exchange Building, which is included on the National Register of 
Historic Places. Broverman said the loan was to be used to help the building 
meet city fire code requirements.

POSTSCRIPT: 'WITH THE 16,000 VOLTS SHE TOOK, SHE SHOULD HAVE COME DOWN AS A 
CHARCOAL BRIQUETTE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last August, a rummaging raccoon scaled a steel-and-barbed-wire fence at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, stumbled into a 16,500-volt switch and shorted the 
circuit in a burst of sparking electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory in Pasadena was blacked out for 90 minutes as workers scrambled 
to get the space exploration facility on line. 
</P>
<P>
Workers found the raccoon on the ground at the lab's main electrical 
substation, charred, semiconscious and with much of its coat sheered off by its 
brief experience as an electrical component. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Year of Treatment 
</P>
<P>
"With the 16,000 volts she took, she should have come down as a charcoal 
briquette," Pasadena Humane Society Officer Endel Jurman said. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of medical treatment at an animal refuge in Little Tujunga Canyon, 
the raccoon has made a surprising recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our more gratifying successes," said Martine Colette, director of the 
Wildlife Waystation, a nonprofit agency dedicated to caring for injured or 
abandoned wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
The raccoon, nicknamed Voltage, has grown into a healthy 20-pound beast on a 
steady diet of dog food, mixed vegetables and an occasional rat. 
</P>
<P>
The skin on its paws is still healing, but Colette said the animal stands a 
good chance of being returned to the wild in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"Voltage has responded miraculously," she said. "She was really fried." 
</P>
<P>
The raccoon's run-in with the high-voltage switch occurred at 10:41 p.m. Aug. 
30, when few workers were on duty. Only JPL, which does contract work for NASA, 
was blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
Backup generators sustained most of the vital electronic equipment at the lab. 
Information from unmanned space probes was recovered from computer tapes at 
remote antennae sites. All in all, it was a relatively minor incident. 
</P>
<P>
But the damage to Voltage was a tad more substantial. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered first-degree burns to her nose and extremities. Colette figured it 
was a lost cause. But after weeks of treatment and a flow of antibiotics from 
an intravenous tube, Voltage regained her health. 
</P>
<P>
She spent six months in the way station's hospital and has since been put in an 
outdoor cage on the sprawling 160-acre facility. 
</P>
<P>
Voltage now spends most of the day hiding in a steel drum near the top of the 
closet-sized cage and comes out at night to eat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Win Freedom 
</P>
<P>
Her neighboring patients include a paralyzed hawk, a kangaroo with cataracts 
and three scruffy bears from Yosemite that Colette said would rip the doors off 
a Porsche for a doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
"Trash bears," she said, explaining that their taste for human garbage dooms 
them to captivity for life. 
</P>
<P>
Voltage, however, remains a good candidate for parole because she has retained 
a fear of humans. Colette said that if Voltage is released, she will be 
returned to the San Gabriel Mountains, though nowhere near JPL. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory is taking no chances though. It has electrified the fence 
surrounding the substation and insulated the high-voltage switches to prevent 
future close encounters of the raccoon kind. ASHLEY DUNN

COMPETING FOR THE HAWAIIAN SKIES; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES BATTLE WITH FARES AND GIMMICKS TO WIN BIGGER SHARES OF A GROWING 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
With the purchase of troubled Hawaiian Airlines, former baseball commissioner 
Peter V. Ueberroth and Newport Beach businessman J. Thomas Talbot are trying 
their luck in one of the nation's toughest airline markets. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Honolulu-based Hawaiian Airlines, U.S. airlines have often lowered fares 
to attract passengers at the risk of reduced profits. "It's a very competitive 
market," said Thomas Wogan, marketing manager for Delta Air Lines in Honolulu. 
"It's a real challenge to make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a group that includes Ueberroth and Talbot made a bid for the 
carrier, which has lost money for the last two years because of costly repairs 
to its aging fleet and destructive fare wars. At their $22-a-share price, it 
would cost the group nearly $22 million to gain 51% interest and nearly $43 
million to buy all of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inter-Island Travel Up 
</P>
<P>
Most major U.S. airlines fly to Hawaii. They are led by United, the largest 
U.S. carrier in the market with 14% of the passengers, according to airline 
industry analysts. Delta ranks second. In November, Phoenix-based America West 
is scheduled to begin daily flights to Honolulu, which will intensify the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for passengers isn't confined to trips from the mainland to Hawaii. 
Hawaiian Airlines and its island competitor, Aloha Airlines, have flown 
passengers between the five Hawaiian islands for years. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, United Airlines entered the inter-island market, flying 
passengers from Honolulu to Maui, Kona and Kauai. And in December, a new 
airline, Discovery Airways, is expected to start flying between the Hawaiian 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines are attracted to Hawaii by statistics that show the market is 
healthy and growing. According to the Hawaiian Department of Transportation, 9 
million people flew between the Hawaiian islands last year, up from 7 million 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department in Hawaii says 8 million people visited the state 
from overseas destinations last year, compared to 5 million in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Honeymoon Spot 
</P>
<P>
Spurred in part by increased advertising by the state and bad weather in 
Mexico, tourism in Hawaii swelled this year. According to the Hawaiian Visitors 
Bureau, travel from the mainland is up 10% this year. The bureau had 
anticipated just 3% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Besides vacationers, Hawaii has long been a popular honeymoon spot for West 
Coast newlyweds, and according to United Airlines spokeswoman Sara Dornacker, 
the state is one of the airline's most popular destinations for free trips 
under its frequent-flier program. 
</P>
<P>
But despite its popularity with travelers, Hawaii isn't an easy place for 
airlines to make money. Delta's Wogan says that, because of intense fare 
competition, Delta takes in between 5 and 7 cents a mile for each passenger it 
flies to and from Hawaii. On the mainland, Delta takes in 12.5 cents a mile for 
every passenger. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see what that implies for profits," said Wogan. 
</P>
<P>
To attract customers, most airlines, including Hawaiian Airlines, have tie-ins 
with big tour operators, an arrangement considered crucial to fill planes. 
Airlines have tried a number of gimmicks to reach passengers. 
</P>
<P>
United, for example, is serving passengers on its domestic flights Hawaiian 
meals, such as sesame chicken with chocolate covered macadamia nuts for dessert 
to create an interest in its Hawaiian service. A tiny orchid is placed on each 
meal tray. 
</P>
<P>
But the main area of competition is fares. 
</P>
<P>
Most tickets to Hawaii are deeply discounted. Currently, the airlines offer a 
$348 round-trip fare between Los Angeles and Honolulu that requires an advance 
purchase and can't be refunded. That compares to United's unrestricted coach 
fare of $1,032 round-trip. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Airlines, the discount leader, offers an even lower once-a-week fare 
from Los Angeles. That special fare is $298 round-trip. No airline has matched 
that fare, which is regarded as too low to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at their fares on a market-to-market basis," said Wogan. "Before you 
match them, you have to decide if it makes prudent business sense."

HILLMAN STUDYING $1-BILLION PROJECT ON SITE OF UNOCAL; 
</P>
<P>
COMPLEX ON L.A.'S 'WEST BANK' WOULD BE ONE OF CITY'S LARGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hillman Properties, which late last year acquired the Unocal headquarters 
high-rise in downtown Los Angeles, wants to demolish the building and replace 
it with a huge commercial complex valued at more than $1 billion, the company 
confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the city, the mammoth project would be one of the largest of its 
kind ever built in downtown Los Angeles. It would take 10 to 15 years to 
complete and include 5 million square feet for commercial offices, retail 
shops, parking and a 500-room hotel, according to Robert V. Neary, vice 
president for Hillman Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"It will bring a world-class, multi-use project to that part of downtown Los 
Angeles," Neary said, referring to the west side of the Harbor Freeway, also 
known as the West Bank of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman Properties, based in Newport Beach, is part of the empire built by 
Pittsburgh billionaire Henry L. Hillman. With investments in real estate, 
industry and high technology, the 69-year-old Hillman is one of the richest men 
in America, worth an estimated $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company paid $205 million for the land in a deal that included the 13-story 
Unocal building, where about 1,200 oil company employees now work, and 13 
surrounding acres of property. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman Properties wants to build the project in three phases. The complex 
would include the hotel, five office towers and an open air retail plaza, 
according to Neary. Although he declined to estimate the cost of the 
development, he said the project would have a value of more than $1 billion 
when completed. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase calls for twin 42-story office towers plus parking both above 
and below ground; phase two would add two more office buildings, one 10 stories 
and the other 65 stories, plus parking, and phase three would have a 25-story 
hotel, a 35-story office building, parking and a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts in Los Angeles said the Unocal headquarters, built in 1958, 
is an outmoded facility that needs expensive renovation work to rid the 
structure of its asbestos insulation and provide it with a sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
A law passed last year by the Los Angeles City Council in the wake of the 
disastrous fire in the First Interstate bank building requires certain older 
commercial office buildings in the city to install sprinkler systems within 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman Properties hopes to have the first phase of the project done in time 
for Unocal employees to leave their old office digs and move into the new ones, 
Neary said. But a spokesman for Unocal said the company had not decided what to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no concrete plans now," the spokesman said. "It's all under study 
now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potentially Controversial 
</P>
<P>
Hillman Properties is working on an environmental impact report, after which it 
will formally apply to the city for building approval, according to city 
planner Daniel O'Donnell. The company hopes to break ground on the development 
in the third quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The project may prove controversial because it promises to add more office 
space in downtown Los Angeles, where several other pending projects are 
eventually expected to lead to an oversupply of space. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ralph Jackson, a downtown real estate consultant, "there's going 
to be an awful glut soon," if all these buildings are approved. 
</P>
<P>
The Hillman Properties project also has yet to get the blessing of Councilwoman 
Gloria Molina. Most of the West Bank lies in Molina's district, although the 
Unocal headquarters is actually just across the border from her legislative 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Molina has pressed hard to ensure that West Bank developers provide affordable 
housing in the area in return for approvals to build. 
</P>
<P>
City planners are developing a building plan for the West Bank that is expected 
to be submitted to the City Council for approval within the next few months, 
O'Donnell said.

RULING TO STALL MERGER OF LUCKY AND ALPHA BETA; 
</P>
<P>
11TH-HOUR ACTION DOES NOT MEAN HIGH COURT WILL REVIEW ANTITRUST CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in an 11th-hour action, on 
Monday ordered that American Stores continue to be blocked from merging its 
Alpha Beta and Lucky food chains until the full court considers an appeal by 
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, it appears that American Stores will be forced to operate the two 
chains separately at least until early October, when the Supreme Court is 
expected to decide whether to review the antitrust case. The court reconvenes 
Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
A brief order by O'Connor, who fields emergency requests on rulings from the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, omitted mention of a $16.3-million bond that 
a federal judge earlier had ordered Van de Kamp to pay if he wanted to pursue 
the case with the high court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Withholds Comment 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding that the order . . . is a stay without bond," said 
Andrea Sheridan Ordin, chief assistant attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp had asked the high court to continue to block the merger without 
requiring a bond since his appeal was on behalf of California consumers. He 
said he would not pursue the case unless the bond were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Michael T. Miller, a senior vice president of American Stores, said the company 
would withhold comment on any options it might have until its attorneys 
scrutinize a written opinion that O'Connor is expected to issue in the next 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's order does not necessarily indicate that the court will choose to 
review the antitrust case, noted Kathy Arberg, a Supreme Court spokeswoman. 
About 5,000 petitions are filed with the court every term, she said, but only 
about 150 cases are granted a review. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
String of Disappointments 
</P>
<P>
Votes of four of the nine justices are required to approve a review. If they 
decide to consider the American Stores case, the ban against the merger will 
remain in place until the court makes a judgment, O'Connor's order said. 
</P>
<P>
The order was another in a string of disappointments for American Stores, which 
has been attempting for nearly a year to combine the two supermarket groups 
under the Lucky banner. The Salt Lake City company had hoped to win formal 
clearance for the merger this week from U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In an order last week, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court lifted its prohibition 
against the merger as of Monday and returned the case to the U.S. District 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
It was Kenyon who, last September, issued a preliminary injunction to halt the 
merger after he found a likelihood that it would reduce competition. In March, 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court said there was evidence to support that finding, but 
it overruled the injunction, saying Van de Kamp had waited too long to sue. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon later imposed the bond requirement to cover any losses incurred by 
American Stores as a result of the delay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition Cited 
</P>
<P>
American Stores paid a hefty $2.5 billion for Lucky Stores in June, 1988, with 
the intention of merging the chains to save on advertising, distribution and 
other costs. Miller said the delay is costing about $1.5 million a week, not 
including legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp belatedly challenged the Lucky-Alpha Beta merger last Sept. 1, 
contending that it would reduce competition and cost consumers millions of 
dollars a year in higher food bills. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores has countered that it would pass along cost savings of $50 
million to $60 million a year to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Alpha Beta operates 212 stores and Lucky has 335 throughout California. The two 
had combined sales of about $8 billion in 1988. Sales for all of American 
Stores, which has a total of 1,911 stores in 40 states, are expected to reach 
$20 billion this year.

SOCAL GAS ENDS OPPOSITION TO WY-CAL PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
SIGNS OPTION TO BUY SPACE ON PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wy-Cal Pipeline Co. -- the underdog in the race to build a natural gas pipeline 
into California -- got a boost Monday when Southern California Gas Co. agreed 
to drop its opposition to the project and signed an option to buy space on the 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Wy-Cal, which has proposed a 1,000-mile, $665-million pipeline from Wyoming to 
Kern County, said SoCal Gas had agreed to an option to buy space to move no 
less than 75 million cubic feet a day of gas on the pipeline, the maximum 
capacity of which is 650 million cubic feet a day, over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes a week after Wy-Cal announced that Pacific Gas &amp; 
Electric Co. had acted on its option to buy 50 million cubic feet a day on the 
same pipeline over 20 years. As a result, PG&amp;E got an option to buy up to 
25% of WyCal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Ongoing Contest' 
</P>
<P>
The announcements apparently rejuvenate the Wy-Cal project, which had fallen 
behind rival Kern River Gas Transmission Co. in its bid to build a pipeline 
from the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Wy-Cal also has a letter of intent from Southern California Edison to transport 
50 million cubic feet of gas a day for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still an ongoing contest . . . (but) it reaffirms that Wy-Cal is still a 
viable contestant in what has been called the gold rush to California," said 
Ellen Beswick, editor and publisher of the industry newsletter Natural Gas 
Intelligence in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The two projects and several others are competing for a share of the expected 
strong market for natural gas in California. 
</P>
<P>
Wy-Cal has an added advantage over Kern River: a certificate from the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission. Kern River's application with FERC is pending. 
</P>
<P>
If SoCal Gas exercises its option with Wy-Cal, it can buy a portion of the 
pipeline's California facility after 20 years. SoCal has a similar agreement 
with Kern River, said gas company spokesman Richard S. Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Agreement 
</P>
<P>
A Kern River spokesman said his project had customers interested in more than 
800 million cubic feet a day, including firm commitments for 180 million cubic 
feet a day. 
</P>
<P>
SoCal Gas previously agreed to move 150 million cubic feet a day on the Kern 
River pipeline and 200 million cubic feet a day on the Altamont pipeline from 
Canada that would connect with the Kern River system. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping its options open with both competing pipelines, SoCal Gas "is just 
hedging (its) bets now," Beswick said.

WATCHDOG GROUP REJECTS COMPLAINT ABOUT SEARS 
</P>

<P>
An industry watchdog group said Monday that it found no grounds for 
substantiating Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.'s contention that Sears, Roebuck and 
Co.'s "Everyday Low Pricing" ad campaign is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Ward complained to the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division 
(NAD) that the campaign was misleading and deceptive to consumers. Ward 
challenged Sears' statement that it had reduced prices on 50,000 items, 
complaining that Sears treated each size and color variation as a separate 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Different colors or designs of the same product were counted as separate if 
consumers commonly view them as different, for example, whitewall versus 
blackwall tires, white shirts versus stripes," the NAD report said. "The 50,000 
count was substantiated." 
</P>
<P>
Both retail giants are based in Chicago, and their chief executives are 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The Ward complaint, filed April 7, focused only on the first six weeks of the 
Sears ad campaign, which was launched March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Ward Chairman Bernard Brennan said the company is disappointed with the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings speak for themselves," a Sears spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price-Matching Policy 
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, Ward also said Sears was actually raising prices on several 
items marked as "lowered in price." 
</P>
<P>
NAD disputed that contention. 
</P>
<P>
Ward also said Sears' price-matching policy on "identical" items carried in 
other stores, particularly appliances and electronics, was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Ward also said that, in the first weeks of the new pricing format, Sears 
refused to match competitors' prices as advertised. Much of the merchandise 
carried Sears' own labels and salespeople claimed that items weren't directly 
comparable to those offered by competitors, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
The NAD upheld the ads on this issue as well, but requested that Sears' 
price-matching policy be examined further to clearly state which merchandise is 
identical to competitors' items.

People who habitually leave the headlights on and the jumper cables at home are 
target customers for a new battery from GNB Inc. that has a built-in spare. 
</P>
<P>
The Champion Switch combines a conventional 12-volt main battery and a reserve 
into a package that will fit about 70% of the cars on the road, GNB said. 
</P>
<P>
If the main battery dies because the lights were left on, the driver can flip a 
switch on the battery and start the car using the reserve power, which is good 
for 20 engine starts. 
</P>
<P>
The suggested retail price is $109.99, roughly twice the price of conventional 
batteries, although some retailer discounting is likely. 
</P>
<P>
The battery goes on sale in Southeastern states in October and elsewhere in in 
1990.

Struggling minicomputer maker Wang Laboratories Inc. said Monday that it has 
worked out an accord with its banks on a new debt package and will immediately 
make some payments. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. An Wang, chairman and CEO of Wang Laboratories Inc., announced that the 
company had reached agreement with its bank lenders and intends to make all 
required payments on its debt obligations today," Edward Grayson, senior vice 
president and general counsel, said. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell, Mass.-based Wang, which has been hit by slumping sales, owes about $962 
million. Last week it suspended certain principal and interest payments after 
rejecting a proposal from its creditor banks, led by the Bank of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement with the banks requires Wang to pay its debts in the order 
that they come due, using proceeds from asset sales. It would allow Wang to use 
the remaining proceeds to borrow more cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Loans 
</P>
<P>
The company is looking for a buyer for its InteCom unit, which produces private 
branch (PBX) telephone systems and which posted about $90 million in sales last 
year. It said it was exploring the sale of other businesses, including its Wang 
Credit Corp. leasing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Wang said amendments to existing agreements should provide it with $100 million 
in fresh loans, and it has pledged its assets, excluding inventory, to the 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the once-prosperous firm ran into serious problems after it failed 
to update its products and make them compatible with units made by 
International Business Machines Corp. and other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers have speculated that Wang may seek a partner to buy some 
assets or take it over. The company is shielded from a hostile bid, however, 
because control of the voting stock is held by the Wang family. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Wang announced the resignation of Frederick Wang, son of founder An 
Wang and president of the company. The younger Wang had a reputation as an 
ineffective executive. Industry analysts said his resignation signaled that An 
Wang, who is recovering from cancer surgery, was intent on assuring the 
company's survival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search Team 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the resignation, the company said it was exploring a variety of 
options and had retained Salomon Bros. and Lodestar Group as financial 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Wang said Monday that a three-person selection team was close to finding a new 
president. In the meantime, Vice Chairman Harry Chou is serving as acting 
president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the company's agreement with its banks and the search 
for a new president are prerequisites for Wang to proceed with its 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"These two issues are hiding the real issues," said Smith Barney analyst Shao 
Wang. "Clearly, you need the financing and an operating guy in charge, but you 
still have to face the real issues of how this company is going to turn 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Wang's financial fortunes have deteriorated since 1984, when it reported record 
annual profits of $210.2 million. In the next year, the company barely broke 
even, and last week it reported a net loss of $424.3 million for fiscal 1989.

Kraft Foods will buy an experimental fat substitute from NutraSweet Co. to use

Skokie, Ill.-based NutraSweet announced the development of the fat substitute 
Simplesse, which is made from egg whites and skim milk, last year but the 
substance has not yet received Food and Drug Administration approval.

Kraft has developed its own fat substitute -- Trailblazer -- but it plans to

RULING PROMPTS LIMIT ON TRADING OF 'STOCK BASKETS'

<P>
The Philadelphia and American stock exchanges on Monday limited trading in 
their new "stock basket" products because of legal uncertainty over which 
government agency should regulate them. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges, which began offering stock baskets to investors three months 
ago, also denounced a Chicago federal court ruling that suddenly has thrown the 
products' legitimacy into question. 
</P>
<P>
"The real loser in this controversy is the American investor," said Amex 
President Kenneth R. Leibler. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Exchange President Nicholas A. Giordano said Friday's decision by 
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was "a major step backward in the 
regulation and development of innovative new products." 
</P>
<P>
Stock baskets are financial innovations priced to reflect changes in broad 
market indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Investors 
receive quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any regular 
cash dividend declared on the stocks in the index. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges said trading in stock baskets would be largely restricted to 
liquidation, meaning that holders would be able to sell them for cash. Market 
makers at the exchanges are obligated to buy them if no other buyers emerge to 
ensure an orderly market and prevent panic selling. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty over stock baskets was raised Friday by the Chicago court, 
which ruled that such products resemble commodity futures, such as those for 
pork bellies and grain, and should be monitored by the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission, not the Securities and Exchange Commission.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: GROUP IS DETERMINED TO SPREAD THE NOTION THAT ADS 
SHOULD SELL IDEAS 
</P>

<P>
The actor who appears on the TV screen looks relatively normal. Except for one 
thing. Atop his shoulders, in the spot where his head would normally be, sits a 
TV set. 
</P>
<P>
"Tubehead" -- as he is called -- spends the entire 15-second commercial trying 
to yank the TV set off his head. At the very end of the commercial, this 
message flashes on the screen: Can you switch off? 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect to see this ad on American television any time soon. But one major 
Canadian network has agreed to run it. Behind this commercial -- which is 
scheduled to be filmed this week in Vancouver -- are two Canadian documentary 
film makers who are also environmental activists. They say they are fed up with 
the ads on commercial TV. And they have decided to take on not only North 
America's major TV networks -- but advertisers, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to redefine the advertising industry," said Kalle Lasn, co-founder 
of the Media Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Vancouver that says 
commercials on television should sell fewer products and more progressive 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the organization says, if huge paper companies can run ads 
about how many millions of trees they are growing, there should also be room 
for groups like theirs to purchase air time on network TV about the sensitive 
ecological environments that these same paper companies are destroying. 
</P>
<P>
"Our point is to break the trance that people get into when they are watching 
TV," said Lasn, 47, a documentary film maker who at one time worked as a 
researcher for an advertising agency in Japan, compiling research for such 
clients as Coca-Cola and General Foods. "We're all consuming like crazy people 
during a time of ecological crisis. We will offer anti-consumption messages in 
the middle of all those other messages that keep telling people to buy things." 
</P>
<P>
How to pay for the production and air time of these "alternative" TV ads? Well, 
last month the group printed its first issue of a quarterly magazine that it 
has appropriately named Adbusters. It hopes to get enough subscribers -- and 
contributors -- to fund a number of anti-consumption ads. In the meantime, 
Adbusters has received some financial backing from several environmental 
groups, including the Sierra Club and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw the film 'Ghostbusters,' " admitted Bill Schmalz, the co-publisher 
of Adbusters who thought up its name. "But I think the name is quite catchy." 
Schmalz, 49, has never worked for an ad agency, but has filmed several short 
movies that focus on the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of Adbusters, which was printed last month, includes articles 
on subliminal advertising, how advertisers attract the attention of children 
and even an article on how to make and air your own TV commercial for under 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The organization does have some support from American advertising experts. Two 
mid-level West Coast advertising executives -- who have asked not to be named 
-- are quietly acting as consultants. And George Gerbner, dean emeritus at 
Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, has also 
spoken out for Adbusters. 
</P>
<P>
"The networks discourage anything but mainstream advertising, and that is too 
limiting," said Gerbner. "There is a long history of the networks refusing to 
accept certain ads because they are afraid it could cost them their major 
advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nothing better symbolizes the types of advertising that Adbusters 
supports than a print ad that appears on the inside of the front cover of its 
first issue. The "ad" is a parody of a former Winston cigarette campaign. In 
it, an attractive woman is holding a pack of cigarettes while she stands in the 
sort of natural setting typical of tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
But the headline on the ad is a shocker: "If it wasn't for cigarettes, I 
wouldn't have cancer." The ad was included in a book of parody ads called "A 
Tale of Advertising in America," published in 1976 by Terry Shukle, an Ann 
Arbor, Mich.-based free-lance photographer. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is to create an ad that is humorous enough to attract attention but 
that doesn't offend the very people you're trying to reach," said Shukle. "But 
I wonder if people can handle ads like this. There seems to be so many 
restrictions these days, that if you stick your nose out, you're liable to get 
it whacked." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Adbusters has already had its nose whacked by the Canadian Broadcasting 
Network, which has rejected the "Tubehead" ad based on rough illustrations that 
it was sent. But Canada's second largest network, Canadian Television Network, 
has agreed to run it. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Adbusters will be trying to get the ad aired on the major TV stations in 
Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. But the prospects look dim. Executives at 
the three major networks say the ad sounds too controversial for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Showing that ad would be like shooting ourselves in the foot," said Harvey 
Dzodin, vice president of commercial clearance at ABC television in New York. 
"Make that, shooting ourselves in the tube." 
</P>
<P>
Dzodin said that ABC doesn't accept any "issue" ads. He said the network 
believes that such issues should only be covered in news programs or talk 
shows. "Maybe they should call Sam Donaldson and see if they can get on his 
show," said Dzodin. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you this," posed Rick Gitter, vice president of advertising 
standards at NBC, which wouldn't accept the ad. "Would the Los Angeles Times 
run an ad that suggested people use your newspaper for kindling?" 
</P>
<P>
Although an executive at CBS declined to specifically comment on the "Tubehead" 
ad, he said CBS does have a policy about those ads it won't accept. "We would 
not broadcast a commercial that denigrated television," said Matthew Margo, 
vice president of program practices at CBS. "We also don't broadcast 
commercials that take controversial positions on important topics. If we did, 
companies with the finances at hand could control the national agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the folks at Adbusters say that's a lot of bunk. 
</P>
<P>
"The networks have been using that argument for years," said Lasn. "The people 
with the money are controlling the national agenda right now. We think we can 
counteract them with this $5,000 ad."

Arco's New Product Fuels Big Ad Purchase 
</P>
<P>
While Arco may be helping to clear the air with a less polluting gasoline, it 
is also about to flood the air with plenty of ads promoting it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Arco has made one of the largest media buys in Southern California 
history. And during the month of September it will spend nearly $5 million to 
air four TV advertisements -- and another $2 million on various radio and print 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
These ads will promote Arco's new unleaded gasoline, called EC-1, which will 
replace leaded gasoline at its Southern California stations on Sept. 1. The new 
gasoline, for pre-1975 cars and pre-1980 trucks, would eliminate 20% of 
emissions if all vehicles without catalytic converters in the area switched 
from leaded gas, according to Arco. 
</P>
<P>
During the month of September, the average TV viewer in Southern California 
will see the Arco commercials "between 60 and 70 times," estimates Robert 
Kresser, chairman of the Los Angeles ad agency that created the commercials, 
Kresser/Craig. He said 99.9% of the Southland's TV viewers will see the ads, 
which all feature actor James Earl Jones as narrator. 
</P>
<P>
But will viewers be turned off by the flood of Arco ads? "I hope not," said 
Kresser. "That's why we made four of them." 
</P>

Clippers Give Up Seats for Perimeter Ad Space 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, the folks at Great Western Bank saw to it that the Los Angeles 
Lakers stopped playing basketball at the Forum and started playing at the newly 
named Great Western Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Clippers are about to cash in too. No, the Great Western Sports Arena 
is not in the offing. But the Clippers have given up an undetermined number of 
court-side seats for the sake of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Adtime, a company based in Spain that sells modular ad displays at stadiums 
throughout Europe, has struck a deal with the Clippers to sell ad space around 
the court's perimeter. The ads will appear on sheets of rotating plastic vinyl, 
and advertisers will pay only for the time that their ads are in the eye of the 
television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clean signage," insisted Andy Roeser, executive vice president of 
the Los Angeles Clippers. "It won't in any way reduce your ability to watch the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
An executive from the U.S. marketing arm of Adtime said the Lakers weren't 
interested in the signs. It apparently would have required the elimination of 
some court-side seats at the Forum. "They can sell those seats for $300 
apiece," said Tom Valdiserri, senior account executive at Chicago-based Frankel 
&amp; Co. "It wouldn't make sense. What are they going to do, relocate Jack 
Nicholson for an ad?"

Shoe Firm Gears Up for Large Campaign 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear has put its advertising budget in gear. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles footwear company says it plans to double its annual ad budget 
in 1990 to $50 million. What's more, L.A. Gear ads will appear on national 
network TV next year for the first time ever, said Sandy Saemann, the company's 
senior vice president. Although the ads are created in-house, Vitt Media, a 
large media buying company, has been hired to purchase the media time. 
</P>
<P>
But L.A. Gear may have been caught a bit off balance in the lucrative 
back-to-school season. The company has created just one new commercial for the 
period -- an ad promoting its "Brats" line of women's shoes. It will also 
continue to air an award-winning, year-old ad that features former Lakers 
center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar meeting a fan in the locker room.

The California Highway Patrol is marking the 17th year of its air-to-ground 
anti-speeder program, and the CHP reports its "air force" is alive and well 
around the state. "We do enough to keep the ground units busy," said CHP 
Officer Earl Clemente, one of about 30 pilots who fly single-engine aircraft 
over the freeways around the state. Courts have ruled that the program is not a 
speed trap. Clemente explained that in designated areas, the CHP has laid out 
white hash marks a mile apart on the shoulder of the highway. By timing a car 
from one mark to another, officers aloft can determine a motorist's speed.

DEUKMEJIAN BACKS AIR PLAN

Gov. George Deukmejian said he supports a sweeping, 20-year plan to reduce smog 
in the Los Angeles Basin if the business community is involved in implementing 
it. Developed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the plan was 
approved Aug. 15 by the state Air Resources Board. Although the state board's 
members are appointed by the governor, his attitude about the plan was brought 
into question when Jananne Sharpless, the board chairwoman, said she was not 
sure Deukmejian was "totally comfortable" with the program. Deukmejian, winding 
up a series of meetings in New York with bankers and financiers, told a 
reporter that "as long as the regulators will involve the business community as 
they go forward and implement the program, we don't have any problem with it." 
In approving the plan last week, the state board said local air quality 
officials had promised to involve business in the rule making.

The Organization of African Unity laid down tough conditions for talks with the 
South African government, adopting a nine-page strategy document that endorses 
the known negotiating position of the African National Congress, South Africa's 
main black nationalist group. The document, adopted by an OAU ad hoc committee 
meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, calls on Pretoria to lift the existing state of 
emergency, free political prisoners, end a ban on political organizations and 
restrictions on individuals, withdraw troops from black townships and end 
political trials and executions.

In a country that has enjoyed almost seven years of uninterrupted economic 
growth, there is a growing public concern about poverty, according to the 
latest Gallup Poll. Telephone interviews with a randomly selected national 
sample of 1,250 adults conducted earlier this month show that most people think 
poverty in America is increasing. Only a third of Americans (33%) approve of 
President Bush's handling of the problems of poverty and homelessness, while a 
majority (53%) disapprove. The harshness of this rating is underscored by the 
fact that as many as seven in 10 Americans (69%) approve of the overall job 
Bush is doing. The vast majority of adults polled (83%) believe that the 
percentage of Americans living below the poverty line is increasing from year 
to year. And 45% believe that living conditions for the poor have worsened.

Jackpot poker, a game now popular in some California card rooms, violates state 
law prohibiting unofficial lotteries, the state attorney general's office said 
in Sacramento. The initiative that created the California Lottery in 1984 
specifically prohibits the authorization of any other lottery in the state. 
Jackpot poker is a form of lowball poker, a game that is legal in card rooms 
where not prohibited by local ordinance.

Up to $3.4 billion is needed to clean up 10 of the Great Lakes' dirtiest areas, 
according to a study billed as a step toward putting a price tag on making the 
lakes safe for wildlife and people. Governments should explore creative means 
of financing the cleanup such as establishing a trust fund and suing polluters, 
said the study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, which does research for 
congressmen from 18 Northeastern and Midwestern states. The report emphasizes 
solving the problem, whereas earlier studies dealt primarily with what caused 
the pollution and which areas were worse off, said Michael J. Donahue, 
executive director of the Great Lakes Commission in Ann Arbor, Mich.

The U.S. Air Force announced it is buying at least 10,000 Macintosh computers 
for its worldwide military command and control system, Apple Computer's biggest 
federal sale to date. The sale puts Macs in military operations on a large 
scale for the first time, shattering the Cupertino-based company's longtime 
reputation for 1970s-style pacifism. "It is designed to send out the fighters, 
dispatch ships and tell the Marines to hit the beaches," said Bob Brewin, a 
senior writer at Federal Computer Week who has studied the system. "It doesn't 
sound like the old Apple." The sale to the Air Force is part of a major 
overhaul of the military's system for controlling operations at about 40 
military stations around the globe. The new computers will be hooked to larger 
systems and used for everything from word processing to electronic mail of 
battle plans.

Jim Bakker's federal trial opened in Charlotte, N.C., with the selection of a 
12-member jury and six alternates to hear charges that the television 
evangelist cheated followers out of $4 million so he could afford an expensive 
life style. "Our faith is in God," Bakker proclaimed as he strode into the U.S. 
District Courthouse. While jury selection was getting under way in the 
courtroom, Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, went on television to tearfully 
ask viewers of the "Jim and Tammy Show" to send money and pray for her husband. 
Bakker, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 
15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.

West Virginia Atty. Gen. Charlie Brown resigned as part of an agreement to halt 
the second criminal case against him since he took office, a prosecutor said. 
Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes said he agreed to drop a grand jury 
investigation into Brown's campaign finances and reports that he lied under 
oath during a child custody hearing. Brown, a Democrat, was elected in 1984 and 
reelected without opposition in 1988. In 1986, Brown, 39, was acquitted on 
charges that he shook down his staff for campaign contributions. He contended 
that because he had solicited the contributions after the 1984 election to help 
pay off campaign debts, the actions did not fall under a state law prohibiting 
state officials from soliciting campaign funds from their staffs.

PHONE WORKERS TRICKLING BACK AMID SOME GROUSING OVER PACT

Pacific Bell's work force trickled back Monday in the wake of the settlement of 
a 15-day strike by the company's 41,800 California workers. 
</P>
<P>
The slow trek to normalcy -- with from 10% of workers returning at some offices 
to more than half at others -- was not surprising. Under terms of a tentative 
agreement reached Sunday between phone company negotiators and representatives 
of the Communications Workers of America, employees have until Wednesday to 
check in by phone with their supervisors and until Friday to go back to their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
While many workers expressed relief at being able to return, there was some 
initial sentiment against ratification, based primarily on the health benefits 
called for in the new three-year contract, which is aimed at reducing Pacific 
Bell's medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
To keep operations running smoothly as the striking workers returned, many of 
the 17,000 managers who were assigned to temporary 12-hour-a-day duty as 
operators and technical workers during the strike remained on the job. But 
customers calling directory assistance in some areas still experienced delays; 
a tape-recorded message informed them that "although our strike has ended, we 
are still arranging for the return of our operators." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said delays in 
directory-assistance calls can be expected through this week as 353 operators 
return to work locally. 
</P>
<P>
"By Friday, service will be back on track," Bonniksen added. 
</P>
<P>
Operator service, however, should show immediate improvement, Bonniksen said. 
While there remains a backlog of about a week for new service orders, repairs 
should be completed right away. 
</P>
<P>
Del McBryde, president of CWA Local 9510 in Santa Ana, said 4,731 union members 
in Orange County are glad to be back. 
</P>
<P>
"They're happy the strike is over," McBryde said. "They are disappointed about 
some parts of the agreement, but the good points outweigh the bad." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Pacific Bell nor CWA was able to make a systemwide estimate of the 
number of workers who showed up Monday. But Vira Milirides, a CWA spokeswoman 
in San Francisco, said she believes that the majority of workers would return 
quickly because "people need that paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Bonniksen said nearly 65% of Pacific Bell's work force of 5,240 in its service 
area for Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties returned to work Monday, 
although exact figures were not available as workers continued to report in. 
She added: 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like a wall of people was trying to get in." 
</P>
<P>
The CWA paid no strike benefits during the walkout. The union's San Fernando 
Valley local spent more than $20,000 for groceries for needy members' families 
during the strike, according to the local's president, Ellen Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative contract must still be ratified by the CWA membership, with 
mailed ballots to be returned to union headquarters by Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The new health plan, which would take effect in 1991, would create a network of 
doctors whose fees would be paid primarily by Pacific Bell. Employees who used 
the network would pay no more than 5% to 10% of the cost of treatment and 
nothing at all in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who choose to go outside the network, however, would have to pay the 
first $1,000 of medical expenses per year out of their own pockets, up from the 
current deductible of $150. Workers subsequently would be reimbursed for 70% of 
the cost of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But the presidents of two CWA locals said Monday that they are upset that 
deductibles had been raised and that even those employees who used the new 
network would have to pay a small share of the cost. Under the old contract, 
Pacific Bell paid 100% of the cost for workers who used an approved health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's premature to make a prediction about ratification," said Valley CWA 
leader Edwards, "but I feel like the bargaining committee let me down." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Alvarez, president of a CWA local covering Pasadena and East Los Angeles, 
said that there was not enough information yet to make a judgment on the 
contract but predicted that the membership's vote on ratification "will be 
close, either way." 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard an awful lot of grumbling this morning," said Al Anderson, a 
communications technician who returned Monday to his job at a phone company 
switching-control center in Beverly Hills. "I rather doubt" that the new 
contract will be ratified. "A lot of people have been saying that (after the 
ratification vote), we may have to go out again." 
</P>
<P>
The new contract gives workers increases in wages, bonuses and other payments 
that will raise salaries overall by 11% over three years. Pay currently ranges 
from about $228 a week for some operators to $650 for some skilled technicians. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unhappiness over health benefits, some union members also 
were concerned that the new contract contains no "amnesty" clause prohibiting 
Pacific Bell from disciplining strikers accused of illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
There were 450 "serious acts of sabotage or vandalism" during the walkout, 
according to the company, which said Sunday that rewards of $10,000 to $25,000 
for information leading to an arrest and conviction remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez on Monday said that a member of her union, who was arrested during the 
strike for allegedly spraying a can of foul-smelling, nontoxic liquid at a 
strikebreaker, had been suspended by phone company officials hours after she 
returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes continued Monday at Washington-based Bell Atlantic; NYNEX, which serves 
the Northeast; and Chicago-based Ameritech. Those three companies employ 
147,000 workers and serve 35 million customers.

The three-year drought that has brought parts of southern Orange County close 
to water rationing this summer has also left the county's vast acreage of 
underbrush unusually vulnerable to fire, officials warned Monday. A heavy 
rainfall that occurred earlier in the year increased the growth of underbrush, 
they said, but when the rain stopped, the brush died, adding to an 
already-significant amount of flammable grasses in so-called wild lands. 
</P>
<P>
"With the rain came an increased amount of vegetation," said Capt. Joe Kerr of 
the Orange County Fire Department. "When the rain did not maintain itself, the 
dieback only added to the flammable shrubs already there, making a bad 
situation worse." 
</P>
<P>
Since the drought began, brush fires have increased at an alarming rate, 
according to figures maintained by Kerr's department, which serves a number of 
cities and the unincorporated areas in the county. In 1986, there were 92 
wild-land fires that destroyed more than 156 acres. In 1987, 186 fires burned 
more than 2,116 acres. And in 1988, 396 fires swept over 3,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr said that in addition to the increase in flammable shrubs, a recent survey 
of the fuel moisture in the county indicates a higher level of dryness than 
usually found at the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We found the dryness to be what it would have been after the arrival of strong 
Santa Ana winds at the end of the fall season," he said. "Those winds haven't 
arrived yet, and with the dryness at this point, it's definitely something we 
are monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firefighters Fear Worst 
</P>
<P>
Because temperatures have been relatively mild this summer and there have been 
few Santa Ana winds, fire officials have been able to contain the problem. But 
the worst may be yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen some mild signs of the Santa Ana winds, and they will probably come 
again even stronger," Kerr said. "They can frequently come towards the end of 
September or October, which is certainly another critical situation. But to 
counteract that, we also have a long-range forecast that predicts rainfall in 
those months." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has had just 8.51 inches rain this year, in contrast with an 
average of about 13. Last year's rainfall was 10.03, according to the 
WeatherData center in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to reduce the amount of brush and wild land destroyed by fire, county 
firefighters are offering several prevention programs aimed at increasing 
public awareness. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to instill into the public that fire safety isn't just for a 
month or a particular season," spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. "We've been very 
fortunate so far." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Zone Around Home 
</P>
<P>
Although the fire season usually begins in June, fire officials began taking 
precautions in May because of the unusually dry conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Weed abatement is one of our programs, where we encourage people to remove 
dead, dry weeds and hanging tree limbs and branches a certain distance from 
their homes," Cha said. "The slightest spark can set off a fire." 
</P>
<P>
She said residents who do not take fire precautions can have fines attached to 
property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, fire officials have posted warning signs in such areas as 
Rancho Santa Margarita and Trabuco Hills, where there is heavy underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
HOMEOWNERS APPEAL HALFWAY HOUSE PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As expected, a group of Wilson Park homeowners has appealed a vote by the city 
Planning Commission allowing developers to build a 24-bed halfway house for 
recovering alcoholics and drug addicts in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The matter now rests with the City Council, which is expected to decide during 
its Sept. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In its appeal, said Michael Migan, an attorney for the Wilson Park Homeowners 
Assn. and other nearby residents, argued that building the recovery facility 
would cause property values to drop, traffic to increase and crime rates to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal cites the fact that more than 650 area residents have signed 
petitions expressing their opposition to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The applicant has not shown why he cannot simply build his drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation facility in a more suitable area of Costa Mesa (or in another 
city, for that matter)," Migan wrote in his application for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission voted 3 to 2 on Aug. 14 to recommend that developers 
Don and Dee Ward be given a conditional-use permit to replace the six-bed 
facility at 380 W. Wilson St. with a building that would house 24 men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
The Wards, a father-son team who are themselves recovering alcoholics, said 
they would go ahead with the project if the City Council approves the Planning 
Commission decision.

<P>
DEBATE ON TRAUMA NETWORKS CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL and LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Los Angeles County trauma system was set up in 1983, private hospitals 
battled hard and even sued to be included in the prestigious network, regarded 
as the crown jewel of the county's emergency services program. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the 10th trauma center of the original 23 permanently bowed out of 
the system. On busy nights, half a dozen of the remaining ones are full and 
temporarily closed. 
</P>
<P>
Problems are less severe in neighboring Orange County, where four of the five 
hospitals that started in the system in 1980 are still members, although they 
too are increasingly finding themselves overloaded with patients and sometimes 
sending trauma patients to other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, Orange County's trauma system seems to be working, said Dr. 
John G. West, a surgeon at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange who is the author of 
national and local studies on trauma care. Still, he said, the network here 
maintains a "very precarious" balance. 
</P>
<P>
"What we don't realize is that our hospitals are barely making it" financially, 
West said. If one hospital's trauma center closes -- as Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center warned it might last year -- other trauma 
centers may be motivated to close too, West said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gregg Pane, an emergency physician at UCI Medical Center in Orange who is 
is chairman of the county Emergency Medical Care Committee, agreed that the 
pressure on trauma centers is intense. 
</P>
<P>
The census in the medical center's trauma unit has been at an "all-time high 
this month because other centers are overloaded and full," he said. "There have 
been a number of cases where patients don't (go) to the nearest trauma center." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether that affects the outcome for patients' injuries or illnesses, 
Pane replied: "I would think it probably does. We're talking minutes . . . . If 
present trends continue, we're at risk for potential closures. That affects all 
citizens, rich or poor alike, who may be in an auto accident, just as it does 
in (Los Angeles)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Further Closures Feared 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, several more hospitals may yet bail out. The number of 
temporary closures because of patient overload is way up over last year -- 
"more than 1,000%" at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, for example, 
according to statistics from the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that now is the time to evaluate the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the Los Angeles County trauma network, before allocating more 
money to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
But the chairman of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services 
Commission, Dr. Stephen L. Michel, warned that any tinkering "is fraught with 
danger and may gut the whole system." He believes that the system's only 
salvation lies in increased public funding. The commission is expected to 
present its recommendations today to the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, growing numbers of Los Angeles County trauma patients are not 
getting to a trauma center at all or making it only in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children 'Barely' Made It 
</P>
<P>
For example, when a drunk driver ran down two children in South-Central Los 
Angeles last month, the trauma center less than 10 minutes away was closed to 
new patients. After waiting 15 minutes for an ambulance, the children -- one 
with tire marks across his chest and a blood pressure that was falling -- had 
to wait further for a helicopter to be summoned to fly them to the trauma 
center at Childrens Hospital in Hollywood, Los Angeles city paramedic Becky 
Hegwar said. 
</P>
<P>
"They probably made it within the hour, but barely," Hegwar said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an emergency room, a trauma center is required to have a surgeon and 
anesthesiologist on the premises ready to operate and also a battery of other 
specialists such as orthopedists and neurosurgeons available within 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
This staffing requirement is designed to ensure that patients bleeding from 
injuries to vital organs such as the brain, lungs and heart can be operated on 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, about 60% of Los Angeles County's serious trauma injuries are caused 
by traffic accidents, health officials say. The rest are from violent crimes 
such as stabbings or shootings or from work-related injuries. The trauma system 
in Los Angeles County was originally designed so that no point in the county 
would be more than 20 minutes from one of 23 trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, trauma patients will get to one of the four existing centers 
-- UCI Medical Center, Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission 
Viejo, Fountain Valley Regional Hospital, and United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana -- within 20 minutes, said Betty O'Rourke, program director of 
the county's Emergency Medical Services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No North County Center 
</P>
<P>
Pane acknowledged, however, that a trauma center currently is "missing" in 
northern Orange County. That area has been not been served since 1983, when two 
hospitals there decided to close their trauma centers because they were losing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
At first, though, hospital officials were leaping at what they saw as a prime 
opportunity. As it turned out, though, most trauma centers lost money, and at a 
time when hospitals already were being squeezed by government and insurance 
cost controls. Worse, many surgeons and other specialists who staffed the 
trauma centers revolted when they discovered that many patients could not pay 
their bills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Neurosurgeon 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital has recently been struggling with that 
situation. The hospital had been trying for six months to recruit a 
neurosurgeon and regularly closing temporarily to neurological trauma patients 
because it had no specialist to treat them. 
</P>
<P>
In June, for instance, the hospital was closed to neurological trauma cases for 
497 hours, said Barbara Patton, the hospital's assistant administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in July, the hospital persuaded a neurosurgeon from the Midwest to 
relocate. But he quit after six weeks, complaining of "no reimbursement or poor 
reimbursement," Patton said. The hospital is now "back to square one," often 
being closed to neurological trauma cases and still seeking a neurosurgeon, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Orange County's four trauma centers were on closure status for 188 
hours in the second quarter of 1989, up from the 135 hours for the first 
quarter of the year, said Emergency Medical Services' O'Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
As Orange County's population and traffic continue to increase, so has the 
number of trauma victims, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo rarely goes on closure status, but the number 
of its trauma patients has soared, said Gary Fybel, senior vice president. The 
trauma center took care of 573 people in 1987 and 705 in 1988, he said. Through 
this June, it had treated 397, setting a record pace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurance Requirement 
</P>
<P>
One health care economist, Greg Bishop with the Trauma Resource Project in 
Irvine, has noted that a major part of the financial problem for trauma centers 
in the state is that although automobile accidents are responsible for about 
two-thirds of all patients sent to trauma centers, less than 10% of trauma 
center costs is reimbursed by automobile insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other states, he said, California has no requirement that a 
motorist carry medical insurance as part of his auto policy. 
</P>
<P>
Public subsidies of the trauma network would probably offer the quickest 
salvation. Earlier this summer, however, Gov. George Deukmejian blue-penciled 
$100 million earmarked in the Legislature's budget for emergency services 
statewide. Health officials hope that money raised through the recent passage 
of Proposition 99, which raised taxes on tobacco products, will eventually be 
released to the counties. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it can be expected that many health-care programs will stake a claim 
to the money. 
</P>
<P>
David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said he expects that there will be no subsidies for trauma centers without a 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 survey by the council of 10 hospitals showed that the average loss per 
trauma patient was $4,386 among those classified as having no insurance.

GOOD SAMARITAN WAS JUST TOO DARNED GOOD

Bobbie Lynn Beal's escape plan depended on finding a sympathetic and helpful 
motorist, according to Orange County sheriff's deputies. It went wrong Monday 
when the motorist turned out to be entirely too helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Beal, 21, a prisoner at the county honor farm in El Toro, was one of nine women 
on a work gang cleaning up El Toro Park at Jeronimo Road and Los Alisos 
Boulevard on Monday morning, authorities said. About 11:35 a.m. she bolted, 
running northwest on Jeronimo away from the park, Sheriff's Department Lt. Bob 
Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Once out of sight of the work gang, Beal took off her blouse and, dressed in 
jail jeans, tennis shoes and a bra, flagged down a passing motorist, Rivas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beal told the woman in the car that she had been attacked by a man and asked 
the woman for a ride home so she could change clothes and report the attack. 
The woman agreed to help out, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rivas, the woman took Beal into her car and began to drive off 
when she encountered what she thought was a stroke of good luck for Beal: a 
sheriff's patrol car driving by in response to the report of the escape. 
</P>
<P>
The woman leaped out of her car and flagged down the deputy, who recognized 
Beal's clothing as standard jail issue, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Beal, who was serving time for "a lot of minor violations" and was scheduled 
for release in November, was taken to Orange County Jail, where charges of 
attempted escape were to be added to the list, Rivas said.

ZACATECANS FEEL RIGHT AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
MEXICAN STATE HAS FOLLOWING IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since J. Jesus de la Riva arrived in Southern California for a visit nearly two 
weeks ago, the phone hasn't stopped ringing. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting schoolteacher from the Mexican state of Zacatecas has received a 
nonstop barrage of invitations to outings and to the homes of friends and 
relatives, all of them immigrants from his hometown of Luis Moya. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like I never left home," said De la Riva, 40, who is staying with a 
sister in Orange County. "It turns out I'm related to half of Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
Nine schoolchildren, escorted by De la Riva on the trip sponsored by a club of 
former Zacatecans in Los Angeles, have had a similar reception. Most are 
staying with relatives and friends in Los Angeles while being treated to such 
Southland attractions as Disneyland and Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
31 Clubs in County 
</P>
<P>
The sponsoring group is one of 31 Zacatecan clubs in Los Angeles County. Each 
represents a different municipality or county in Zacatecas, a largely 
agricultural and mining state in Central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Club members like to boast that half of their home state's population -- about 
600,000 former Zacatecans -- now reside in Southern California. Mexican 
Consulate officials in Los Angeles say that, while this may be an exaggeration, 
the number could be as high as 400,000. There are no precise counts. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican states such as Michoacan, Jalisco and Guanajuato may rival Zacatecas in 
the size of their expatriate communities in the Los Angeles area, but none 
match Zacatecans' level of community organization. 
</P>
<P>
"They display a high degree of mobilization and a greater consistency than the 
others," said Mexican Deputy Consul Mario Nunez Mariel. 
</P>
<P>
Club leaders meet regularly as part of the Federacion de Clubs Zacatecanos 
Unidos (Federation of United Zacatecan Clubs) and sponsor joint fund-raising 
events. Individual clubs, like Club San Pedro, which raised money for the 
all-expenses-paid trip of De la Riva and his students, also regularly hold 
dances, raffles and other fund-raisers for public improvements back home. 
</P>
<P>
In the municipality of Jalpa, for instance, the town's only public ambulance 
has lettering on its side that reads: "Donated by Club Jalpa of Los Angeles, 
Ca." Other clubs have contributed funds for road construction and have brought 
electricity and running water to isolated villages. Another has helped build a 
high school. Still others have landscaped plazas, restored churches, developed 
athletic fields, and provided medicine and meals for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The continuous flow of people and goods between the towns in Zacatecas and 
Zacatecan enclaves in Southern California goes back generations, in an exchange 
that distinguishes the Mexican immigrant experience from that of other 
immigrants farther from their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We help because we haven't forgotten the necessity we saw when we lived 
there," said Julian Estrada, president of the clubs' federation, who immigrated 
to the United States four decades ago but still regularly visits Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There Is Work' 
</P>
<P>
"Life is harder there," added Estrada, who lives in Long Beach and is a partner 
in a construction firm. "Here, life can be good and bad, but at least there is 
work." 
</P>
<P>
That is why, when Alfredo Menchaca received a letter asking for help from the 
municipal president of Morelos, Zacatecas, he did "what every Zacatecano would 
do," he said. Turning to his family, which includes six brothers living in Los 
Angeles, Menchaca took up a collection for their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't forget your roots just because you are far away," said Menchaca, 43, 
who left Zacatecas 12 years ago but returns about once a year to visit. 
Menchaca, a building maintenance manager who spends a lot of his time traveling 
the freeways responding to beeper calls, laughs when he thinks of the contrast 
to his previous life. Like many of his Zacatecas compatriots, Menchaca grew up 
on horseback and became expert in the care of animals and the operation of farm 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Also like most Mexican immigrants, Menchaca has regularly sent money to 
relatives in Mexico, and the idea of combining forces with others to help 
finance improvements back home made sense to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to organize ourselves, unite our people and nurture our 
culture," said Menchaca, president of Club Morelos, which he founded three 
years ago. Like most of the clubs, Club Morelos has a core group of fewer than 
100 active members who organize fund-raising events that draw from a few 
hundred to 1,000 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the clubs in the Zacatecan federation have been formed within the last 
three years, according to Estrada, the federation president, who gives 
</P>
<P>
much of the credit to Zacatecan Gov. Genaro Borrego Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
While governors from various Mexican states occasionally visit the Los Angeles 
area, Borrego has visited annually since his election three years ago. He plans 
to return again this year for the Nov. 26 celebration of "Zacatecan Day," 
officially designated by the city last year, Estrada said. More than a dozen 
municipal presidents from the state are also expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican governor has worked closely with the clubs, approving their 
projects, matching their contributions with state funds and encouraging 
municipal authorities to do the same, Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
"This governor has opened his arms to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of large communities of former compatriots in Los Angeles is not 
lost on Mexican state governors, according to Nunez of the Mexican Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
"They are keenly aware of the important role our workers play here" -- and of 
the dollars they send back to Mexico, he said. "Governors don't just come here 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
Ties with the home country are not only political. Next month, the clubs are 
expecting a big turnout to welcome the bishop of Zacatecas, who has promised to 
bring the Santo Nino de Atocha, a statue of the Christ Child, revered across 
Mexico and particularly in its home state of Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs also plan a celebration this year for Antonio Aguilar, Mexico's 
premier singing charro and a folk hero in his native Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the men at a recent meeting of the Zacatecan federation, the 
entertainer, who commands sell-out performances whenever he visits Southern 
California, remains a role model to his compatriots in Los Angeles. Almost to a 
man, the club members sport neatly trimmed mustaches and long sideburns, and 
some still wear the pointed cowboy boots of their Mexican rural roots. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the federation meeting, the discussion turned to the use of 
hats at federation events. President Estrada "respectfully" requested that, for 
the sake of appearances, the men doff their Western-style hats whenever they 
attend indoor events. 
</P>
<P>
But Roman Cabral, president of Club Valparaiso, garnered the loudest applause 
when he walked up to the podium and objected: "Most of us are rancheros 
(country folk). If you take away our hats, you take away our identity and then 
we're not Zacatecanos anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Hat or no hat, Southern California Zacatecans remain appreciated patrons of 
their compatriots back home. 
</P>
<P>
In De la Riva's hometown, the children look forward to club members' visits 
each Christmas when they distribute thousands of dollars in toys and candies, 
he said. And the three-week Los Angeles trips that Club San Pedro awards to the 
top students in the municipality have made his job easier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They all want to come, so they study harder," De la Riva added. 
</P>

LA HABRA'S MOORE SIGNS WITH CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortstop Tim Moore of La Habra High School said Monday that he has signed a 
contract with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who was a 12th-round selection in the June amateur draft, had planned to 
play at Fullerton College next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't feel I was ready for college," Moore said. "I kind of wanted to 
give this a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Moore hit .530 for La Habra last season. He was an All-County selection and a 
second-team All-Southern Section pick. 
</P>
<P>
He will begin playing in the Arizona Instructional League on Sept. 15.

SOCCER LEAGUE ORGANIZERS SEE SPORTS AS WAY TO FIGHT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of a new Orange County league are inviting players to get their 
kicks from soccer instead of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The United Latin Soccer League is looking for players 17 and older to play a 
four-month season of recreational soccer, league spokesman Gil Garcia announced 
at a press conference in Santa Ana Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The league plans to encourage young athletes to say no to drugs and register to 
vote, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what the crisis is right now -- drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Villanueva, who is organizing the league along with Gabriel Sanchez, 
was one of the founders of the successful Orange County Soccer League, which 
began in 1978 and now has 90 teams in five divisions in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We want strongly to focus on 'no drugs' because I think our kids need a lot of 
help," Villanueva said. He also wants to get more soccer leagues affiliated 
with the California State Soccer Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The league will be affiliated with the California State Soccer Assn. South and 
the United States Soccer Federation, which is a member of the Federation of 
International Futbol Assn., the international governing body of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
The league will stage a qualifying tournament at Santa Ana Stadium during the 
second week of October to divide teams into divisions based on skill. 
</P>
<P>
Competition will begin the second week in November at various locations in 
Orange County and Pomona. The 18-man teams will play a 30-game schedule. Games 
will be played on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Registration fees have not been set, but organizers hope to raise enough 
sponsorship money to make participation free, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who truly likes soccer and is going to go all out and give up their 
Sundays is welcome," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Players and teams can call Villanueva or Sanchez at 554-8778.

BLASTERS, WOLVERINES FIND SOME SOLACE IN DEFEATS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was some consolation for Laguna Hills Blasters Coach Robert Melendrez when 
the La Crescenta Condors defeated the Texas Illusions, 1-0, Monday for the 
title in the American Fastpitch Assn. fifth International Friendship Tournament 
at Maxwell Park in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The title game allowed the Blasters a measure of pride. The Blasters can say 
they lost to the eventual champions. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Wolverines, only other Orange County girls' softball team to 
advance to the quarterfinals, can make the same claim. The Wolverines also were 
eliminated by the Condors, losing, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
La Crescenta knocked the Blasters out of the tournament in the semifinal round 
with a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we just ran out of gas," Melendrez said. Laguna Hills played seven 
games in the four-day tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarterfinals, Laguna Hills defeated a 3-0 team, the Camarillo Breakers, 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We laid the bunts down and slapped (the ball) in that game," Melendrez said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Condors matched the Blasters' style of play in the semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tough for us to beat them because they are quick like us. Give me a big, 
slow team (to play) anytime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blasters won't win many games with power. They peck away, a run at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Said Blaster infielder Erika Frazier: "We just didn't have the same amount of 
intensity as we did in the first game today." 
</P>
<P>
They also were without Maureen Del Mazzio, a Canyon High player, who started 
the semifinal game but left because of pain from her impacted wisdom teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"One player in a critical position, like Mo (Maureen), can make so much of a 
difference in a game," Melendrez said. 
</P>
<P>
La Crescenta, defeating Texas in extra innings, scored the winning run in the 
bottom of the eighth when Tina Baca lined a single into right-center field, 
scoring Jeanne Mixon, who had tripled. 
</P>
<P>
"I had stranded several runners today," Baca said. "I wasn't intimidated (in 
that spot), but I knew I had to do something." 
</P>
<P>
The Condors' pitchers did their part too. 
</P>
<P>
In the victory over the Blasters, Jenny Berry pitched a two-hitter. Against the 
Illusions, Janell Campbell pitched a four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also gave La Crescenta a measure of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, which emerged from pool play without a loss, had defeated La Crescenta, 
2-1, Saturday on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the seventh.

EL TORO MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO CHEATING DEFENSE DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Toro businessman accused of bilking the U.S. Defense Department of 
$350,000 by doctoring government expense reports pleaded guilty Monday to two 
criminal counts arising from the scam. 
</P>
<P>
Roger L. Edmonds, 53, faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a 
$500,000 fine as a result of his plea in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to 
counts of mail fraud and making false claims to the government. 
</P>
<P>
As head of a small, now-closed machine shop called SME Prime Co. in Maywood, 
Edmonds over several years sent the government inflated bills for in-progress 
work that was never completed on three defense contracts -- in one case, simply 
adding a zero to an invoice, according to government prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, he wasn't doing the work, but he told the government he was, 
just to get paid," Assistant U.S. Atty. George B. Newhouse Jr. said after the 
trial. The contracts in question were for the production of aviation hose 
assemblies, tank gear assembly carriers and automotive work tables. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the Pentagon has been hit with charges of widespread abuses in 
its procurement methods, Newhouse said, the Edmonds case points up potential 
problems that the government itself faces in dealing with small contractors who 
are not subject to the same checks and balances as larger, more frequent 
Defense Department contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of these small contractors do not have large bases of capital, 
they often rely on what are called "progress payments" -- reimbursements for 
labor and materials as the contract progresses -- to keep them going. That may 
mean that the government is paying for a product it has not yet seen, Newhouse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a relatively common form of abuse that we run into in the defense 
procurement industry," Newhouse said. "Especially among these small 
contractors, we find a lot of expense padding." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kept Company Afloat 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds used the money from his inflated billings to keep his struggling 
company afloat and to pay such personal expenses as credit card and country 
club bills, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
The reporting fraud came to light after an Arizona company that did business 
with SME began receiving complaints from unpaid subcontractors and after 
Edmonds then abruptly closed the doors to his 10-employee workshop and dropped 
out of sight, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
An ensuing investigation led to discovery of the abuses and a 30-count 
indictment against Edmonds. The remaining counts were dropped under Monday's 
plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds, believed to be still living in El Toro, could not be reached for 
comment after entering the guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge William M. 
Byrne Jr. His attorney, Joel Levine of Los Angeles, said: "There was evidence 
that there had been some false billing -- not to the extent alleged in the 
indictment, but to the point that it was in (Edmonds') best interest to plead 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Levine, while maintaining that the government's losses to Edmonds in the 
expense scam were lower than the $350,000 cited by federal prosecutors, 
declined to provide an estimate of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer also asserted that Edmonds intended to complete the three government 
contracts on which he reneged but ran into financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive for doing this (fraudulent reporting) was not to buy a Mercedes and 
run to Brazil. The money that was extracted from the government was put right 
back into the business to try and stay alive," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentencing in October 
</P>
<P>
He said Edmonds lost his own savings in the company, losses that exceeded those 
of the government. But he added that Edmonds is now running another machine 
shop that does not do business with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds' sentencing is set for Oct. 23 in Los Angeles, but one former business 
associate said he has already made up his mind as to what he believes to be 
proper punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my opinion that the guy ought to do some time," said Del Sturman, who 
runs a machine shop in Tempe, Ariz., that contracted with Edmonds on one of the 
government contracts. "The guy was a fraud -- he put me into bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
Sturman said Monday in a telephone interview that he was forced to file for 
federal bankruptcy protection after the government demanded $130,000 in 
reimbursement for an order of automotive work tables that never was filled. 
Edmonds, a subcontractor in the project, had filed expenses with the government 
for work that was never done and then disappeared, Sturman said.

Burlington Air Express Inc., an international cargo-express company, reported 
an operating profit of $6.1 million for the second quarter, nearly three times 
the $2.1 million posted for the comparable quarter last year. Revenue rose 10%, 
to $211 million from $191.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strong second-quarter earnings reflect Burlington's service enhancement 
program, gains in our domestic and international market share and contributions 
from our air-cargo charter activities," said David L. Marshall, Burlington's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based company, a subsidiary of the Pittston Co., reported that more 
than half of its revenue for the quarter came from international transactions.

CHLOROFLUOROCARBON USERS ARE FEELING PRESSURE TO STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BURROWS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, workers at Johnson Electric in Hauppauge, N.Y., used a solvent 
called NF-1000 to clean the computer boards that control traffic lights in many 
Long Island towns. The stuff cleaned like magic, then quickly evaporated -- no 
drying necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But after the state of New York found out that the company was using the 
solvent, which contains Freon, Johnson President Donald Leslie said he was soon 
"bombarded with a mountain of paper work." 
</P>
<P>
Freon is a member of a class of chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or 
CFCs, widely thought to be responsible for the depletion of the Earth's 
protective ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson quickly switched to an alternative that did not contain CFCs but that 
costs twice as much. "Anything to get rid of that paper work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paper work is one of the many pressures urging metropolitan area businesses to 
think more about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has called for CFC use to be phased out by the year 2000, and 
prices for CFCs are skyrocketing because of the Montreal Protocol, a 38-nation 
treaty that limits production to 1986 levels and calls for it to be reduced 
further by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is expected next month to tack a 60-cent fee onto each pound of CFC 
produced. Most of these products now cost 50 cents to $1.60 a pound. The fee, 
which would be retroactive to July 1, would increase to $1 in January and to $2 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our smaller customers are not going to be able to compete," said 
Arthur Dhom, vice president of Pride Solvents of West Babylon, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, industry experts say, these factors spell the end for these 
"wonder" chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs, first introduced in Freon by E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. in the 
1930s, are now the force behind an estimated $135-billion worth of business. 
They fill the coils of refrigerators and car air conditioners and the bubbles 
in foam packaging. They are the solvents of choice for cleaning circuit boards, 
electronic components and metal parts of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs have had such a broad appeal because they are nontoxic, they do not 
corrode rubber or plastics, they do not leave a residue, and they evaporate 
quickly. "If I spilled a drum of Freon, the floor would be dry in 10 minutes," 
Dhom said. 
</P>
<P>
That is great for cleaning processes -- but potentially disastrous for life on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have pointed to CFCs -- as well as to other chemicals -- as the 
cause behind the hole, discovered in the late '70s, in the ozone layer over 
Antarctica. The ozone layer, which is in the stratosphere, protects Earth from 
much of the sun's ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts and 
other ailments. (Stratospheric ozone is different from low-level ozone, an 
industrial by-product and component of smog.) 
</P>
<P>
CFC manufacturers say that they have been searching for alternatives for years. 
Only recently have CFC users begun to find ways to reduce the amounts 
evaporating into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, General Motors and Nissan announced plans to stop using CFCs by 
the mid-1990s, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and General Electric 
unveiled plans to curtail their use of them. 
</P>
<P>
Although industries whose profits depend on CFCs will be hurt, "I don't think 
many consumers will notice," said Steve Anderson, branch chief of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency Global Change Division. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerator prices, for example, could rise $20 to $30 if CFC costs triple, 
said David Doniger, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Clark, a staff scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a New 
York-based environmental group, adds that suitable substitutes already exist 
for packaging and that solvent costs represent only 1% of the cost of a 
computer. "The price to consumers will be a manageable increase, and it's 
certainly worth the cost," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson confirms that the EPA intended to make CFCs expensive. Until recently, 
CFC costs were so low that they were reluctant to spend money to pursue 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have risen by 50% to 100% since the start of the year in anticipation of 
lower supplies, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we hear about great new alternatives every week," he said. "It seems a 
lot of companies are finding they would rather be part of the solution than 
part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that use CFCs already have begun to feel the pinch. By freezing CFC 
production at 1986 levels as of July 1, the Montreal Protocol caused a 20% 
cutback. Dhom of Pride Solvents said customers are already getting less than 
they request.

BUSINESS MAJORS GRAB FOR COURSES IN AMY VANDERBILT MEETS DONALD TRUMP

<P>
Even in the dog-eat-dog corporate world, you can't serve sloppy spaghetti at 
your dinner parties, business students at Stetson University are told. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Miami, aspiring moguls learn to put the butter plate on 
the left -- and never forget to RSVP. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. business still runs on bare-knuckle competition, a few institutions 
are recognizing that students need to learn their manners before entering the 
fray. 
</P>
<P>
It's Amy Vanderbilt meets Donald Trump, as courses in the social graces and 
communication skills begin to appear at some business schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We were totally unprepared for the response," said Stetson University 
professor Stephen Barnett, who incorporated several etiquette lectures into his 
sales-management class at DeLand College last semester. "The students had so 
many questions and took such an interest in the topic, we've decided to 
expand." 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Barnett is planning a weekly evening course in etiquette that also 
would address such related subjects as proper attire and cross-cultural 
business relationships. He plans to stress social skills during the annual 
three-week overseas trip for his students at the private college near Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to the whole thing is making the students prepared for all the 
different people and situations they'll face when they leave school," Barnett 
said. "Here, it's comfortable and they get along well. But they may not be 
equipped to, say, entertain properly or set a table. Some of this stuff is so 
basic it's scary in a way." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Lee, wife of Stetson President H. Douglas Lee, has become the 
unofficial mentor in Barnett's class by giving several lectures and drawing on 
her experience as a seasoned hostess. 
</P>
<P>
For the course, she offered tips on "power entertaining" and being a gracious 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she advised those holding a dinner party to plan scrupulously and 
avoid leaving the table once the meal is served. For guests, bringing a small 
gift or flowers is a nice touch, even at business-related dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that one does for a regular party shouldn't change because it's 
with business colleagues," Lee said. "Manners are manners." 
</P>
<P>
Many college-age students stumble socially and are perplexed by protocol 
because of the way they were raised, said Karen Aronoff, who began lecturing on 
business etiquette last year at the University of Miami School of Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids whose parents -- for the most part -- were part of the '60s 
counterculture. Their mottos were 'do your own thing' and 'forget tradition,' " 
she said. "It's not surprising their children are not familiar with the 
traditional social routines." 
</P>
<P>
Nelda Crowell, a spokeswoman at the American Graduate School of International 
Business in Glendale, Ariz., predicted that more campuses will begin etiquette 
courses in anticipation of European Economic Community trade reforms in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to teach American business people how to work over there 
and not look like a fool," she said.

The number of television shows that have been returned by popular demand can be 
counted on a couple of chewed fingernails. The number of much-beloved programs 
that popular demand has failed to bring back is, on the other hand, very large. 
But cable has now entered the equation in a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," which premiered on NBC in the summer of 
1987, survived the network numbers racket for only two seasons. Yet it was 
beloved by critics and by quite decent-sized audiences, who responded to Jay 
Tarses' series about a single, independent-minded woman riding the pleasures, 
pains and perplexities of Manhattan life. 
</P>
<P>
Those who appreciated the program's candor, charm and sensitivity included some 
executives at the Lifetime cable channel, to which "Molly Dodd" transferred 
last April. New shows for a second cable season will start shooting in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
This is relieving news for all the admirers of the series and its resilient 
star, Blair Brown. Actors profess, not wrongly, an ability to play anything. 
But the fact is that some roles are a good deal more becoming than others, and 
what actors pray for is a particular congruence in spirit and understanding 
between the player and the part. 
</P>
<P>
"Molly Dodd" was created for Brown by Tarses, a friend for years before the 
show was launched. "We used to talk about each other's lives a lot," Brown said 
one afternoon last week. 
</P>
<P>
While it is folly to presume too many one-to-one match-ups between player and 
part, it seems clear that Brown and Dodd are, equally, free spirits with a 
taste for unconventionality, and that both are alternately tough-minded and 
vulnerable, having pushed themselves to the edge of nervous collapse. As Brown 
has said, she has tried all the current nostrums, up to and including Rolfing. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm a very cynical person," Brown says, "but this last year has been 
so terrific I've had very little to complain about." 
</P>
<P>
Brown finds marriage to be the death of romance, she says, and she does not, 
thus far, believe in it. Her long relationship with actor-director Richard 
Jordan produced a son, now 7, a second-grader who lives with Brown in 
Manhattan. Although the relationship ended, she and Jordan remain close and 
cordial. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Brown is in rehearsal for "The Secret Rapture," a play by her 
close friend David Hare, which is a substantial hit at the National Theatre in 
London, already into its second cast. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which Hare is directing, opens for what amounts to a preview run at 
Joe Papp's Shakespeare Festival on Sept. 8 and then moves to Broadway and the 
Barrymore Theatre for an extended run starting Nov. 2. "It's easier than an 
out-of-town tryout," Brown says. She will have to leave the cast in February to 
resume her other life as Molly Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
She has also, during a hiatus from the series, made a feature film, 
"Strapless," similarly written and directed by Hare and shot in Britain. 
Co-starring Bridget Fonda and Bruno Ganz, it will be seen at the New York, 
Toronto and Telluride film festivals in search of an American distributor, 
which it does not have. Two firms that were interested in it, Atlantic and 
Island, have both, as Brown says, "gone bust in recent days." 
</P>
<P>
She and Fonda play sisters living in London, she a doctor who has gone to 
London to work for the national health system "because that's the way she wants 
to practice medicine." Ganz enters her life, changing it in all the ways 
romantic love can: positively, negatively, chaotically, unpredictably. "In the 
larger texts," Brown says, "it's about politics and medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Now that cable shows have become eligible for Emmys, Brown has received a 
nomination for her "Molly Dodd." "You're never supposed to admit that you care 
about awards. But that nomination meant so much to me, just because we're doing 
the show on cable now. It seemed to me it's so good for the business. It just 
confirms that there is an alternate network these days. And it's nice to know 
there's life after the Big Three." 
</P>
<P>
Moving to cable meant a lower production budget, but not for the first time 
necessity became the mother of creativity. "We couldn't have as many sets," 
Brown says, "which meant writing longer scenes. And they made the show much 
fuller." 
</P>
<P>
As the critics observed, a show that had been refreshing for its concern not 
with zowie exit lines but with nuances and the shadings of relationships and 
moments became even more admirable in its reversals of sitcom formulas. 
</P>
<P>
By the bizarre logic of network thinking, "Molly Dodd" during its two NBC 
seasons was shot in Hollywood, although Molly lives in New York, as in actual 
fact do Brown and most of the cast members and all but one of the regular 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was crazy," Brown says. "It meant I had to stay in a hotel and we had to 
shuttle to New York to pick up location shots." Now, for Lifetime, the show is 
shot at the Astoria Studios in Queens. One of the pleasures surrounding the 
family feeling of "Molly Dodd," with its permanent cadre of players and 
writers, is that opinions can be voiced. "I can say, 'That take is terrible, 
that scene is terrible, let's try something else.' My early experience in the 
movies was that whatever you said, it was, 'Yes, dear, and now will you shut up 
and get on with it?' 'Molly Dodd' is what you long as a theater actor, to work 
with people again and again in a really collaborative way." 
</P>
<P>
Her early television experience was unsettling: "I did 'Wheels,' an appalling 
miniseries with Rock Hudson. I loved working with him. He was such a nice man. 
And I shouldn't complain. I got more jobs off 'Wheels' than from any of the 
more artistic work I've done. But I felt as if I was on the Lusitania, and all 
my own sensors temporarily disengaged." 
</P>
<P>
At the Astoria Studios one day last season, "Molly Dodd" was sharing a sound 
stage with "The Cosby Show." The week's Dodd script had Molly surviving an 
attempted rape. Brandon Tartikoff, the NBC chieftain who had initially liked 
"Molly Dodd" but grew disenchanted with the show's candor as well as its 
ratings and killed it, came by the stage to look in on Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
He found himself on the "Molly Dodd" set as the attempted rape scene was in 
progress. Producer Tarses, says Brown, whirled around and said, "Funny as ever, 
eh, Brandon?"

WORD OF MOUTH WITH ERIC BURNS; 
</P>
<P>
A DIFFERENT HOLLYWOOD TALK SHOW 
</P>

<P>
They aren't exactly George Will, Sam Donaldson and David Brinkley, and their 
show is probably seen by only several people each week, not several million. 
But Eric Burns, Richard Schickel, Van Gordon Sauter and Merrill Markoe are out 
to stir up the world of entertainment. Or at least make their several viewers 
laugh once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Word of Mouth With Eric Burns," a half-hour panel-discussion show in the 
tradition of such political round-table programs as "This Week With David 
Brinkley" and "The McLaughlin Group," airs each weekend on Movietime, the 
basic-cable channel known primarily for its 'round-the-clock promos of 
Hollywood's latest films and interviews with the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Only this show, which purports to examine the social implications of news and 
events from the wide, wide world of entertainment, leaves politics to the big 
boys in Washington. Well, mostly. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent episode, the panel ruminated about the infamous Rob Lowe videotape, 
in which the actor allegedly had sex with a minor in Atlanta while attending 
last year's Democratic National Convention. After airing a segment from the 
tabloid magazine show "A Current Affair," which included excerpts from the 
video, complete with strategically placed black squares, Burns, the creator and 
moderator of the program, asked Schickel, Time magazine's film critic, to 
review the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this huge black square covering most of the movie," Schickel said. "I 
don't understand that. You wouldn't get more than an R rating for this." 
</P>
<P>
If this is all Lowe has learned about making movies after all his years as an 
actor, chimed in Markoe, formerly the producer of "Late Night With David 
Letterman" and a columnist for New York Woman magazine, he'll never make the 
transition from actor to director. "It's out of focus. He got no coverage, no 
reverse shots, no close-ups." 
</P>
<P>
"This is why the Democrats cannot elect a President," interrupted Sauter, 
formerly the president of CBS News and a proud Republican. "At these national 
conventions, the Republicans are so dreadfully stuffy, all they have to worry 
about is getting votes. On the other hand, the Democrats have all these 
marvelous convention diversions." 
</P>
<P>
"To slightly revise my critical judgment," Schickel said, "this video is 
marginally more interesting than a Republican convention. They might have put a 
black box over most of that too." 
</P>
<P>
"Word of Mouth" was born out of Burns' frustration that no one on television 
ever talks honestly about popular culture. A former NBC network correspondent 
and commentator at "Entertainment Tonight" and KTTV Channel 11, Burns has made 
several stabs at critiquing the entertainment business, only to find himself 
stymied by the conflicting realities of covering Hollywood seriously on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"My commentaries for 'Entertainment Tonight' lasted about two months until I 
did one that really annoyed them," Burns said. "It had to do with the coverage 
of the Sean Penn and Madonna wedding, in which my employer was one of the 
egregious participants. So I was suddenly switched to celebrity interviewer, 
and that just made me more determined to find an outlet to be irreverent -- or 
just to be honest." 
</P>
<P>
Burns produced a pilot of "Word of Mouth" last year for KTTV, where his 
commentaries on the station's nightly newscast were similarly phased out, but, 
he said, the business people at the Fox-owned station decided such a program 
would lose money. After leaving KTTV earlier this year, Burns shopped it around 
and last April found a home on Movietime, where he could produce it cheaply and 
control the content entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Movietime likes the show so much that the company just renewed it for another 
26 weeks. But now that HBO has taken over the management of Movietime and has 
plans to thoroughly revamp its programming (see accompanying story), the future 
of "Word of Mouth" is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Movietime has relied mostly on trailers and celebrity interviews to 
fill its 24-hour-a-day coverage of Hollywood. Launched two years ago, it claims 
to be available in 14 million homes. But not all of those homes can get the 
service all the time. Each installment of "Word of Mouth" airs five times each 
weekend (Saturdays at 10:30 a.m., 4 and 7 p.m., Sundays at 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 
p.m.), but Burns said that on his cable system he can only watch it once 
because the space on the dial is shared with the Jewish Network, preacher Gene 
Scott, Fred Sands Realty ads and Iranian programming. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Markoe, Schickel and Sauter all said that in recent weeks people have 
been stopping them at parties and on the street to say they caught a glimpse of 
the show. And Markoe has adopted the mystical "if you build it, he will come" 
sentiment from the film, "Field of Dreams," to explain who does and who doesn't 
watch the program. "If you are meant to see this show, by some act of God or 
fate or something, you will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The show is far from slick, and the cast makes jokes about the undisclosed, 
picayune stipend they receive from Movietime for appearing each week. But they 
put a million dollars worth of acumen, hot air and wit into every topic Burns 
throws their way. 
</P>
<P>
They pontificate seriously on the state of Hollywood journalism, concluding 
that all reporting on entertainment is just a sorry excuse for celebrity 
publicity. They complain about Ringo Starr's attempts to stop the release of an 
album he recorded while he was drunk on tequila. They argue the merits of TV 
newscasts being used in schools, tabloid television and Diane Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
And they offer some "brilliant" Hollywood ideas of their own. While decrying 
the film industry's use of catchy movie titles to mask dubious story lines, 
Markoe pitched this new movie: "Easter -- Who's Risen This Time?" And when 
asked to comment on TV newswoman Linda Ellerbee's hawking of Maxwell House 
coffee in commercials with Willard Scott, Markoe pulled out a bottle of juice 
from behind her chair and said: "I've given this a lot of thought and whenever 
I think seriously, I like to drink Mott's Clamato Juice, a deliciously seasoned 
blend of clams and tomatoes. It's the one to be drinking when you want to be 
thinking." The camera then cut to Schickel and Sauter holding their bellies as 
they laughed uproariously. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my Thursday night poker game," Sauter said later, explaining why he shows 
up every week. "You come down here. There are people here that I really like. 
And we sit around and we sort of belch and scratch and laugh for a couple of 
hours and go home. You don't lose a lot of money. You don't make a lot of 
money. And it's a good evening."

HBO PLANS TO GIVE MOVIETIME CHANNEL A NEW IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HBO, which last week took over the management of Movietime, intends to 
refashion the obscure basic-cable service that plugs and covers the movie 
industry into "a major-league channel" along the lines of CNN, TBS and MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's showbiz, it's going to be Movietime's biz," said Seth Abraham, HBO's 
senior vice president of programming operations and sports, who also serves as 
HBO's representative on the Movietime board of directors. "It'll be short-form 
pieces, headlines -- lots on the channel that will allow people to come and go 
as they please. It will really be a resource for people who are interested in 
the entertainment business, and that includes movies, television, music, 
sports, theater, books." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Movietime -- which was launched two years ago, has mostly been a 
publicity device for the film industry. With several young personalities 
serving as hosts, the cable service has aired movie trailers and celebrity 
interviews interspersed with coverage of gala Hollywood openings. The service 
claims to be available in 14 million homes nationwide, but on many of its 498 
cable systems, Movietime is only offered for a few hours a day. CNN, TBS and 
ESPN, by contrast, are available 24 hours a day in more than 50 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
Movietime is owned equally by eight cable operators and entertainment 
companies, including HBO. The channel previously was run by one of its 
co-founders, Larry Namer, who will remain a member of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham likened the planned HBO version of Movietime to Ted Turner's "Headline 
News" channel or an all-news radio station where the audience knows that at 10 
minutes after the hour they will get a business report, and at 30 minutes past 
they know they will get sports. On Movietime, Abraham said, there may be movie 
reviews at 15 minutes past every hour and a celebrity interview at 30 minutes 
past the hour. 
</P>
<P>
But Abraham cautioned that the new Movietime would not be aggressively out to 
break news stories. "We are not going to make it the CNN of the entertainment 
business," he said. Instead, HBO will spruce up the look of the channel and 
give it a whole new identity and dependability. 
</P>
<P>
HBO has dispatched four executives to Movietime for one to three months as an 
interim management team and will hire a permanent team of executives to oversee 
the changes in the next few months. Abraham said he could not comment 
conclusively on the fate of such regular Movietime programs as "Word of Mouth" 
and insisted that the changes at the channel would not happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at Movietime who did not want to be identified said they believe that 
HBO, which plans to launch another basic-cable channel of its own later this 
year featuring an all-comedy format, was interested in taking over Movietime 
because it wants in on the growing and lucrative world of basic cable. They 
said they expect HBO to try to buy a bigger share of Movietime soon. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham said only that HBO was originally interested in owning a part of 
Movietime and now in managing it because of the way today's TV viewer flips 
impatiently from one channel to the next. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't sit for an hour watching the same program anymore," Abraham said. 
"With remote controls and all the zapping, watching TV in the '90s is going to 
be like walking through the supermarket. Movietime will really cater to 
grazers. It's a perfect vehicle for that kind of television viewing."STEVE

THE LAST STUDIO DRIVE-IN PICTURE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RACHEL ALTMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty some years ago Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox scored big with "Rebel 
Without a Cause" and "The Seven Year Itch." If you were watching James Dean and 
superblonde Marilyn Monroe in those days, you may have been trying to score too 
-- at least, if you were in the back seat of a '49 Ford at one of the nation's 
4,000 drive-in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The drive-ins, introduced to postwar America's booming families as a way of 
getting out without having baby-sitting bills, became the teen-age haunt of the 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's where everyone went on the weekend," says 50-year-old Ronn Teitelbaum, a 
lifelong resident of Los Angeles and the president of Johnny Rockets restaurant 
chain. "It was definitely a hangout. It made little difference what the movie 
was, 'cause by the end of the school week we'd just say, 'Meet ya at the 
drive-in on Saturday night.' We'd go in groups of four or five cars and 
afterwards we'd go and get a soda." 
</P>
<P>
You didn't have to be there to appreciate it, though. Wednesday night, in the 
last of four events on the Los Angeles Conservancy's "Last Remaining Seats" 
series, the Studio Drive-In in Culver City is hosting "Nifty Fifties Night," 
complete with '50s music, a Hula-Hoop contest, a tailgating party and a 
screening of "The Girl Can't Help It," a 1956 musical comedy that featured rock 
'n' rollers Little Richard and Fats Domino and starred Jayne Mansfield and Tom 
Ewell. 
</P>
<P>
Ewell, who also co-starred with Marilyn Monroe in "The Seven Year Itch," will 
make an appearance at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bidding a fond farewell to the Studio Drive-In," says the Conservancy's 
associate director Gregg Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is scheduled for demolition within the next 18 months. This year, 
Southern California also will lose the Pickwick in Burbank and Westchester, and 
the Centinela Drive-In near the Fox Hills Mall on the Westside will be replaced 
by a housing development. 
</P>
<P>
"These 20-, 25-acre parcels of land are very strategically located (near 
interstates) and prove more worthy as real estate developments," says Milton 
Moritz of the Pacific Theater chain, which operates the Studio and 63 other 
drive-ins in Southern California and about 2,000 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The drive-in is far from being lowered into the coffin and frankly I think 
there will always be drive-ins. There are a lot of people who just don't want 
to go to a walk-in," says Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
With double features like "Batman"and "Lethal Weapon 2" playing at the 
drive-in, you just might tolerate the cramped quarters of a Hyundai to see Mel 
Gibson and Kim Basinger on a 50 x 100-foot screen. 
</P>
<P>
First-run movies are playing and succeeding at drive-ins for the first time in 
recent years. In fact, five out of the six top-grossing movies for the summer 
are playing simultaneously at the walk-ins and drive-ins: "Batman," 
"Ghostbusters II," "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Dead 
Poets Society." 
</P>
<P>
"The last two years have really been the two best years for drive-ins in a long 
time," says Moritz. "Years ago you had what were known as sub-runs," he adds. 
For instance, the first-runs being released in Hollywood at Mann's Chinese or 
Egyptian theaters weren't released at the drive-ins until a week or even a 
month later. 
</P>
<P>
Besides first-runs, there are other incentives for going to a drive-in today, 
not the least of which are cost and comfort. "People are rediscovering that 
this is an easy way to go to a movie," says Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, a family of four can attend for $9 -- $4.50 per adult, children 
under 12 free -- and save whatever they'd pay their baby-sitters. They can 
watch "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and talk it to death without disturbing anyone 
around them. They can smoke to their heart's content without getting thrown out 
by an usher. As Moritz puts it: "At the drive-in you're master of your own 
ship." 
</P>
<P>
Drive-ins have undergone a number of renovations in recent years. At 
multiscreen complexes such as the Winnetka in Chatsworth, which was patterned 
after the indoor theaters, Moritz says: "We have as many as six to eight box 
offices operating at once." Cars and trucks can line up at the ticket booths 
one hour before the show. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the sound system has been improved too. Gone are the days of the 
squawk box. Pacific theaters, among others, uses a system called Cine-Fi, which 
enables drive-in goers to listen to the movie through their car stereo. "If you 
have a great radio, you'll have great sound; and most cars today have great 
radios," says Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
Still, few would dispute the fact that a car stereo can't compete with 
Lucasfilm's THX or Dolby, the sound-enhanced stereo systems being used at most 
indoor theaters these days. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no denying that (THX and Dolby) are far more impressive and offer a 
better presentation of the sound effects," says Tim Warner, president of the 
National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) in California. 
</P>
<P>
What's most modern is not always better, though. The cars of yesteryear were 
bigger and more comfortable according to Teitelbaum, who watched a lot of B 
movies in his '49 Ford convertible at the Olympic Drive-In in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Teitelbaum says he doesn't go to drive-ins today, but said he might show up at 
the Studio on Wednesday for nostalgia's sake. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to watching TV at home, lying there comfortably in bed or on the 
couch," he says. "Besides, for Southern Californians who spend a large 
percentage of their time in cars anyway, (there is no incentive.)" 
</P>
<P>
Many people with short memories or with parents who are still sensitive to the 
issue after all these years say the drive-in's reputation as a passion pit is 
myth and legend. Teitelbaum has a clear memory of what they were. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely they were passion pits," he said, laughing. "At that time nobody 
would even consider living together or spending the night together. There was 
no way you could get into a motel, so the drive-in was really the only place to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Teitelbaum also remembers going with his parents when he was young: "We watched 
two movies, a short subject, a cartoon and the (Movie Tone news). It was the 
only picture we had of what was going on in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Tom Ewell, 80, said in a telephone interview that he never went to the 
drive-ins himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to believe that when you go to see a movie, you almost fall in with the 
people on the screen," he said, "(but) the drive-ins were too big and there 
were all those cars around and I never felt that I could lose myself if I was 
watching a movie there. I like more contact with the people performing." 
</P>
<P>
With Wednesday night's guest appearance at the Studio Drive-In, he'll be a man 
of his word.

'THE DANCER' PROMPTS BOARD MEMBER TO QUIT

A board member of the Garden Grove Symphony who is strongly opposed to abortion 
resigned last week after composer and performer James Lee Stanley said that a 
song he would perform with the orchestra over the weekend had been written out 
of "pro-choice" feelings, according to Dick Hain, the board president. 
</P>
<P>
The board member, Ray Romero, "resigned because of his deep convictions from a 
religious point of view," Hain said. "We are sad and will miss him." 
</P>
<P>
Romero, a former vice president of the symphony, said he resigned because he 
felt "the stage of symphony should not be used for that purpose." Stanley's 
position, he said, "goes against my faith." 
</P>
<P>
There were no incidents during the performance, part of a free concert Saturday 
evening that drew about 9,500 to Village Green Park, Hain said. 
</P>
<P>
The lyrics of the song, "The Dancer," which has been played on KTWV-FM, make no 
explicit reference to abortion. Stanley said in an interview last week, 
however, that he wrote the song out of his conviction that for a pregnant 
woman, abortion is "nobody's choice but yours." 
</P>
<P>
Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi, marketing director of the orchestra, said he received a 
number of phone calls before the concert, most of them in support of the 
group's invitation to have Stanley perform with them. MARK I. PINSKY

ODD CHARACTERS BUOY 'MUSICAL COMEDY MURDERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Whodunits, with their arch characters and exaggerated plot turns, are ready 
made for teasing. One of the best murder mystery spoofs is "The Musical Comedy 
Murders of 1940," now at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center's 
Theater-on-the-Green. 
</P>
<P>
The Resident Theatre Company of Fullerton, under Allison Liddi's direction, 
dives right into John Bishop's comedy, thickening the silly accents and gassing 
up the outlandish acting. The first act, which sets up the goofy elements 
surrounding the unmasking of the deadly "Stagedoor Slasher," is better than the 
production's whole -- the second act is a tad labored and confusing -- but this 
is still an engaging, often witty show. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is stubbornly chaotic, hanging loosely on a murderer lurking about as 
an eccentric group of show-biz types gather in an isolated mansion to rehearse. 
As with most whodunits, the odd characters are the ones that usually keep us 
interested, and there are several here, kiddingly played by this capable cast. 
</P>
<P>
We might as well start with the mysterious, goose-stepping maid, Helsa (Holly 
Cardone), who at one moment appears almost nude, hanging dead in a closet, and 
the next is serving a tray full of appetizers. Then there's foppish Roger 
Hopewell (Bruce Dent), a songwriter of dubious talent who collaborates with the 
boozing Bernice Roth (Elisabeth Graham). 
</P>
<P>
Bishop has thrown a comic into this bunch, the wise-guy Eddie McCuen (Mark 
Edward Hawkins) and his love interest, the mouthy chorine, Nikki Crandall (Kat 
Van Schaik). There are assorted other characters as well, all watched over by 
the seemingly amiable director, Ken De La Maize (Kevin Skousen). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any one of these folks could be the bad guy, and the usual clues are 
laid about to help the audience do its own detective work. But Bishop is more 
interested in generating gags -- some corny, some fresh -- at the mystery 
form's expense. You can enjoy this comedy even if you are completely baffled by 
what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
The staging at the Muckenthaler is atmospheric, owing much to Steven Pliska's 
well-crafted lighting. The comic scenes have an almost garish spotlighting; the 
more dangerous scenes, all in shadows, have the right eeriness. Mela 
Hoyt-Heydon's costumes complement the overall look. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Morales' set is fairly ambitious for this kind of theater, involving all 
sorts of revolving doors and hidden spaces. It also captures the appearance of 
a wealthy mansion, while adding the needed edge of colorful satire. 
</P>
<P>

A one-block stretch of Ventura Boulevard was closed and about two dozen people 
were evacuated from businesses in Sherman Oaks this morning after a 
construction crew accidentally broke a natural gas line, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The two-inch gas pipe was broken at 8:45 a.m. at a construction excavation site 
in the 14200 block of Ventura Boulevard, said department spokesman Jim 
Williamson. Ventura Boulevard between Katherine and Calhoun avenues was closed, 
and employees and customers of two businesses on either side of the 
construction site were evacuated as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
The gas line was capped at 9:40 a.m., Williamson said.

<P>
An Encino man who had just used an automated teller machine at a West Los 
Angeles bank was fatally shot this morning by one of two men who tried to rob 
him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Weber, 49, was shot at 12:05 a.m. while in his parked car with his wife 
at a Wells Fargo bank in the 3100 block of Sepulveda Boulevard, Detective Chuck 
Worthen said. 
</P>
<P>
Weber got into the car after completing a transaction at the bank's nearby 
automated teller machine when two men confronted him, Worthen said. One was 
armed with a handgun and shot Weber several times during an apparent robbery 
attempt, Worthen said. They then fled in a car. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if anything was taken from Weber, and Worthen declined to say 
whether he had resisted. 
</P>
<P>
Weber was taken by paramedics to UCLA Medical Center where he was pronounced 
dead. His wife, whose name was not released, was not injured.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl escaped a "possible catastrophe" today when a U.S. 
military jet he was on aborted takeoff in West Berlin after a bird flew into an 
engine, a source close to Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as Kohl was leaving West Berlin's Templehof Airport for 
Bonn aboard a small two-engine U.S. Air Force jet, the source said. As the 
plane was rolling down the runway for takeoff, there was a "tremendous blast" 
from an engine, said the source, and the American pilot quickly aborted 
takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
The source said Kohl was shaken by the incident, but the chancellor appeared 
calm and jovial at a news conference shortly after his return to Bonn.

GANG MEMBER GETS 27 YEARS TO LIFE

<P>
A Lake View Terrace gang member who shot a man to death at a Sylmar "sweet 16" 
party last year was sentenced today to 27 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen sentenced John Tanner, 23, 
after denying a defense motion for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner and Jeffrey Evans, 24, also of Lake View Terrace, were convicted last 
month of murdering John Shaw, 23, as Shaw stood on the front lawn of the house 
where the party was being held. A third defendant, Dennis Elliot, 24, of 
Pacoima, was acquitted of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said Tanner, Evans and Elliot 
approached Shaw as he stood with other guests in front of the home in the 14900 
block of Aztec Street. Evans asked party-goers if they were gang members. Shaw 
replied that he was not, and Tanner interpreted that as a slight and shot Shaw 
in the back, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Coen sentenced Evans to 31 years to life in prison for the 
Shaw murder and for his role in a drive-by shooting earlier that night.

A key witness refused to testify today in the Senate impeachment trial of 
federal Judge Alcee Hastings and was warned that he might be sent to jail for 
contempt of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
William Borders, a former Washington lawyer who was convicted in 1982 of 
conspiracy to bribe Hastings, refused to answer 10 questions about the case 
asked by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) at a hearing of a special Senate committee 
taking testimony in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Borders had previously refused to answer questions from the committee on July 
24 and July 27. He was appearing under a subpoena and was granted immunity from 
prosecution for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, a U.S. District Court judge in Florida, was acquitted of the bribery 
charges in a 1983 jury trial but was impeached by the House last year.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today challenged President Bush's commitment 
to human rights and said the PLO might rethink its peace drive if the United 
States and Israel fail to respond to it. 
</P>
<P>
He said he might convene the Palestinian parliament-in-exile to consider the 
results of its decision in November to pursue a moderate policy based on a 
Palestinian state coexisting with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Israel had intensified what he called oppression against the 
Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slain Palestinians 
</P>
<P>
He named six Palestinians he said had been killed by the Israelis in the 
occupied territories in fewer than 24 hours. Eighteen had been killed since 
Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat waved a magnetic identity card, introduced by Israel on Friday, that 
must be carried by more than 60,000 Gaza Palestinians who work in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"These six new martyrs are an example of Israel's iron fist policies. The 
magnetic cards are another example of Israeli discrimination against 
Palestinians," he said several times. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask Bush, who keeps defending human rights, what he thinks of 
these cards and of the killings," Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is the American position on human rights? Or does that . . . stop when 
it comes to talking about rights of the Palestinians?" 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the PLO raised Israel's measures against Palestinians at every 
meeting it had with the Americans. "The only reply we get from them is to focus 
on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's (election) plan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Patience has limits," Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, told a news conference. "At the end I am obliged to call for our 
PNC (Palestine National Council) . . . and they will decide what policy they 
are going to take." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civil Disobedience 
</P>
<P>
He said the PLO might call for full-scale civil disobedience to step up the 
20-month-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and was considering 
other tactics that he declined to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to deceive my people. They have the right to know the facts. . 
. . They have to understand the Israeli policy, Israeli crimes and the 
conspiracy they (Palestinians) are facing," Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
The PNC approved a peace strategy in November calling for an independent 
Palestinian state to coexist with Israel in its pre-1967 borders. 
</P>
<P>
In December Arafat met U.S. conditions for a dialogue with the PLO when he 
renounced terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO has complained that the talks with Washington have moved too slowly and 
have not addressed PLO ideas on peace.

The Postal Service said today it is eliminating 1,000 managerial and 
administrative positions at 39 facilities nationwide in a consolidation move. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the cuts will have no effect on mail service. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation, which will take effect Sept. 23, is expected to save $30 
million to $35 million a year, the Postal Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs will be eliminated through early retirements and other forms of attrition, 
postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees affected by the mergers will be reassigned within commuting distance 
of their present jobs when possible or they will be relocated, the Postal 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Loss of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
"No processing centers will be shut down, and no one will lose employment," 
Deputy Postmaster Michael S. Coughlin said. "The consolidation centralizes 
decision-making and saves money." 
</P>
<P>
The moves continue a reorganization that began in March, 1986. Since then the 
Postal Service has established 75 field divisions and eliminated 42 district 
offices and cut the number of management sectional centers from 212 to 131. 
</P>
<P>
After the newest round, there will be 73 field divisions and 94 sectional 
centers. Facilities that house the management centers and field divisions will 
continue their mail-handling operations, the service said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the consolidation, the Brooklyn field division in New York will become 
part of the Queens division, and the St. Paul division will become part of the 
Minneapolis division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Centers That Will Go 
</P>
<P>
The management sectional centers to be eliminated are: 
</P>
<P>
Western Region: Pasadena, Redding and Marysville, Calif.; Pocatello, Ida.; 
Salem, Ore.; Fairbanks, Alaska, and Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Central Region: Carbondale and Champaign, Ill.; Sioux City, Iowa; Lafayette and

Iran would restore ties with Britain at once if London showed respect for 
Islamic values, Tehran's deputy foreign minister for America and Europe was 
quoted today as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Relations with Britain can be restored even today," the Iranian news agency 
IRNA reported Mahmoud Vaezi as saying in an interview with the Tehran Times. 
</P>
<P>
Iran broke ties with Britain in March after then supreme leader Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini called for the killing of British author Salman Rushdie who 
he said had blasphemed against Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Vaezi's conditions for a renewal of ties appeared to be a softening of the 
Iranian position. It has previously said ties could be reconsidered only when 
Britain ended its support for Rushdie and his novel.

President Bush may go to Alaska next month to see efforts to clean up the Exxon 
oil spill, a White House official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The official said White House advance teams are exploring the possibility of 
making the trip in the middle of September, after stops in South Dakota and 
Montana to attend those states' centennial celebrations. 
</P>
<P>

Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was in fair condition today at St. David's 
Hospital, where she was undergoing treatment for a urinary infection, a 
spokeswoman said.

"She is improving," said Jan McCrory, assistant vice president for public 
relations at the hospital. Jordan probably will remain in the hospital for 
several days to a week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 53, has a form of multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair. Last year, 
she was hospitalized after she nearly drowned in her swimming pool.

Dorothy Bush, who has called the roll of the states at every Democratic 
National Convention since 1944, resigned today as the party's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, 72, is familiar to convention watchers as the person who, since the 1944 
convention that nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt, called on the state 
delegations to announce their votes. 
</P>
<P>
When she assumed the secretary's job at age 27, she was the youngest person to 
hold the post and the first female. She is no relation to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"What a great experience I have had -- serving with 17 chairmen and heaven 
knows how many wonderful members and friends -- and through the administrations 
of 10 presidents," Bush noted in a resignation letter to DNC Chairman Ron 
Brown.

EPA SUES 34 FIRMS CHARGING VIOLATIONS IN ASBESTOS REMOVAL

<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency began filing lawsuits today in nearly a 
dozen states against demolition companies that allegedly failed to take proper 
precautions while working on asbestos-ridden buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Civil lawsuits were filed by the Justice Department in eight cities and 
additional court papers were expected to be filed later in the day naming a 
total of 34 defendants in connection with violations of asbestos removal 
requirements, the EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a message to those who 
ignore the law," said Henry Habicht, EPA deputy administrator. "Asbestos is a 
known cause of cancer in humans, and it can be a killer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civil Penalties 
</P>
<P>
Habicht said the agency intends to enforce requirements for safety measures 
when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civil penalties from companies 
that do not comply with the safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA officials declined to name all the defendants until the court papers 
are filed. The eight lawsuits filed today involved work on school buildings in 
Missouri, Kansas and Washington state as well as various buildings from 
warehouses to restaurants in Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Papers were also being prepared for civil action involving work on at least 80 
school buildings in New York City, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestos from buildings 
so that its microscopic fibers are not spread through the air. Violators can be 
subject to up to a $25,000 fine per violation and face criminal prosecution in 
some cases. 
</P>
<P>
The inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer, asbestosis, a 
scarring of the lung, and mesothelioma, a cancer of the chest and abdomen. 
Asbestos was used in past years in insulation and other building materials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Particles Linger in Air 
</P>
<P>
Improper removal practices pose health risks to construction workers and people 
who return to the building or to other nearby buildings since asbestos 
particles often linger in the air for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA estimates that up to half of all asbestos-involved renovations may be 
done without the precautions required by the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA officials said that none of the new actions involves criminal charges 
but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Agency sources said papers were also to be filed later in the day as a result 
of violations in California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a contractor was being cited for transporting wine tanks by 
helicopter from a winery in San Jose without removing asbestos insulation pads, 
causing asbestos particles to scatter over miles of countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Other cases involved a Nevada casino; an apartment building in Philadelphia; a 
boiler room at the Marine Corps base at Quantico, Va.; the Seattle-Tacoma 
Airport, and two Seattle restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harvard Study 
</P>
<P>
The EPA crackdown comes only weeks after a Harvard University study indicated 
that in many cases the improper removal of asbestos from buildings may pose 
more of a health risk than leaving the material in the building. 
</P>
<P>
The study by Harvard's Energy and Environmental Policy Center suggested that if 
precautions are not taken, the "removal of asbestos may actually increase 
exposure to building occupants" as well as workers involved in the renovation.

NBC will be selling its new fall television lineup with the help of the 
nation's No. 1 retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., starting Labor Day weekend, 
the network said today. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity program, "America's Brightest Stars: NBC, Sears and You," will 
attempt to attract viewers and advertisers to NBC's five new television series 
through a combination of games, store displays, advertisements and direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said it will run "prommercials" on closed-circuit sets at Sear's 850 retail 
stores. Sears will also mail an eight-page brochure about NBC's shows to 20 
million customers with Sears charge cards and will take out newspaper 
supplemental ads. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the promotion are weekly sweepstakes beginning Sept. 3 that offer 
winners, among other things, a small part on one of the new prime-time NBC 
series. 
</P>
<P>
CBS and K mart Corp. announced a similar arrangement last spring, although 
details have not been disclosed.

JULY DROP IN ORDERS FOR 'BIG TICKET' DURABLE GOODS IS 4TH THIS YEAR

Orders for "big ticket" durable goods fell 1.9% in July, the fourth decline 
this year, the government said today in a report that showed manufacturing 
continuing to struggle despite recent interest rate declines. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items expected to last 
three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion last month, 
the lowest level since October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Military orders plunged 14.7% in July after a 17.4% rise in June. The other 
major decline came in non-electrical machinery, which plummeted 9.7% last month 
after a 4.8% rise in June. 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods, one of the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy 
because consumers often borrow to buy them, also had declined in January, 
February and May. 
</P>
<P>
The latest drop came despite moves by the Federal Reserve Board since early 
June to nudge interest rates lower. Earlier, the central bank had been raising 
rates to dampen economic vigor and inflationary pressure.

J. H. Whitney &amp; Co. officials announced today that they expect to complete 
within 10 days a $1.25-billion takeover of Prime Computer Inc., which has been 
battling a hostile buyout and showing losses for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney partner Russell E. Planitzer said James F. McDonald will be named 
Prime's new president after the tender offer for 79% of Prime's share is 
finalized at the annual board meeting and a Boston accounting firm has prorated 
the shares. A new board will also be installed when the deal is complete, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, a Natick-based minicomputer maker, had been seeking an ally against a 
$1.13-billion hostile bid from MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif., when 
Whitney, the nation's oldest venture capital firm, came forward in June.

Ricky Berry, the Sacramento Kings' star who shot himself to death following a 
quarrel with his wife, did not take drugs or alcohol in the hours before his 
death, the Sacramento County coroner's office reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Berry was "very clean, there was no evidence of drugs at all," said Chief 
Deputy Coroner Bob Bowers, who released the findings of an autopsy and 
toxicology report. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators said Berry, 24, shot himself in the head on Aug. 14 within 
an hour of quarreling with his wife, who left their suburban Sacramento home 
following their middle-of-the-night dispute and returned hours later to 
discover the body. Berry reportedly left a suicide note in which he described 
marital problems. He and his wife, Valerie, had recently moved to their 
$360,000 home.

The man in charge of making sure Canadian athletes were not taking steroids 
feared that he would be physically assaulted by certain top track officials if 
he carried out surprise drug testing, a federal inquiry was told today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my responsibility, but I was not about to get into a physical 
confrontation with guys who were bigger than I am," Tom MacWilliam told the 
inquiry into the use of drugs in amateur sport. 
</P>
<P>
MacWilliam, an anti-doping consultant for the federal government and the 
Canadian Track and Field Assn., was referring to a random drug test of the 
country's national sprint team scheduled in 1985. He said the test was strongly 
opposed by Coach Charlie Francis and Gerard Mach, both paid employees of the 
track association. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed with inquiry lawyer Robert Armstrong that coaches and athletes on 
Canada's national track team were opposed to surprise, out-of-competition drug 
testing, even though it was the stated policy of the association, track's 
national governing body.
