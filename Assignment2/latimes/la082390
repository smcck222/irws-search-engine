YOUR HOME MAY BE THEIR CASTLE, TOO;

<P>
COEXISTING WITH WILDLIFE JUST A MATTER OF TOLERANCE

Although the ubiquitous Southern California bulldozers chase many critters away 
forever, other wild animals stay on, somehow managing to survive, even thrive. 
In fact, most of the survivors, while retaining their wildness, also learn to 
take advantage of living close to man. 
</P>
<P>
Skunks often nest in basements, even between walls, and rattlesnakes rest under 
plants or on rocks in the back yard. Raccoons sneak in through cat doors and 
snack on feline food, while coyotes make meals of the felines themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Reactions of human co-habitants range from "Oh, how cute, let's feed it" to 
fright, horror -- even lethal action. The reactions depend not only on the 
sentiments of the people involved, but also the species of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Some creatures, such as rattlesnakes, almost always evoke a negative response, 
while others elicit mixed or sympathetic feelings. Many of the species regarded 
as nuisances are the very ones that thrive in our midst. 
</P>
<P>
"Coyotes, raccoons, skunks, starlings, sparrows and pigeons are preadapted to 
man-modified habitats," says Douglas Bolger, a graduate student in biology at 
UC San Diego. "They have evolved in an environment like that created by man." 
</P>
<P>
Although few people yearn for a world without wild animals, most city folks 
don't know what to do when confronted with rabbits in the ranunculus or bats in 
the belfry. Guided by common sense and tolerance, most North County residents 
can peacefully coexist with the remaining wild creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past four years, the Humane Society of the United States has been 
conducting seminars on humane solutions to problems with urban wildlife," said 
John Grandy, the society's vice president for wildlife. "The seminars have 
become remarkably popular, because everyone has problems." 
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society will publish a book on the subject this fall. In the 
meantime, Grandy and local experts have both philosophical and practical 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
"We first try to impart tolerance, since many of the problems are attitudinal," 
Grandy said. "People, like the king of England, think their home, including 
their yard, is their castle -- where they have the inalienable right to do 
whatever they want. They want to plant corn in the middle of a family of 
raccoons and not have the raccoons eat it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he recommends that people learn to think like the animal they're 
trying to control and look for compassionate solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The first reaction does not have to be lethal," Grandy said. "That should be a 
last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Project Wildlife, a rescue group, is often called when a wild animal appears at 
the patio window. Volunteers such as Ray West, the group's education chairman 
and vice president for communications, will first ask if pet food is left 
outside overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"That's usually the key," he said. "Almost all these animals are nocturnal and 
forage for food after dark. If they find an easy source, they come and get it. 
The answer then is not to leave the pet food out." 
</P>
<P>
The critter in question will quickly realize this source of food has dried up 
and search elsewhere. People who deliberately feed wild animals cause even more 
problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The animals become dependent," West said. "This may even cost a young animal, 
one which is learning its hunting skills, the opportunity to develop." 
</P>
<P>
The feeding usually backfires because the animals hang around and become bolder 
than normal. A Poway family discovered this phenomenon after watching a coyote 
give birth. Fascinated by the daily drama as the mother raised her young, they 
started putting out food. They were less fascinated when the grown litter began 
showing up on their lawn in broad daylight, looking for food. 
</P>
<P>
The family contacted the city of Poway, which in turn called in an 
extermination company. The company recommended that the coyotes be captured in 
leg-hold traps and shot. Project Wildlife rescuers persuaded the city that far 
better alternatives existed. Their advice: If the family stopped feeding the 
coyotes, the coyotes would go away. This common-sense, humane solution solved 
the problem in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we discourage people from feeding wild animals, we also discourage 
them from taking animals out of the wild and trying to raise them," West said. 
"For one thing, each species needs a specific diet. Also, if an animal becomes 
imprinted on people, it can never safely be returned to the wild." 
</P>
<P>
Like all the rescue groups in the county, Project Wildlife rehabilitates sick, 
young and injured animals with the goal of returning them to the wild. But 
sometimes that is impossible. How can a barn owl -- captured as a baby and fed 
a steady diet of bologna, bacon and hamburger -- be released? Malnutrition 
permanently deformed its talons and feet and left it unable to hunt, or even 
perch. What about the bobcat that was neutered and declawed and lived in an 
apartment? It now exists in a limbo somewhere between tame and wild. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the opposite reaction to contact with wild animals. Instead of 
wanting to take animals home, some people simply want to kill them. A 
surprising number of the animals that rescue groups encounter have been shot, 
poisoned or otherwise deliberately hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Most people, however, are willing to do anything within reason to get along 
with their wild neighbors. Diana Aguirre of Wildlife Center has a number of 
suggestions for controlling "nuisance" animals: 
</P>
<P>
* For skunks nesting under a house, install a one-way dog door, so the skunk 
can get out but not back in. In the meantime, close up all other openings. 
</P>
<P>
* To keep birds and other creatures out of a chimney, cover the top of the 
chimney with a chimney cap. 
</P>
<P>
* To prevent birds from crashing into plate-glass windows, put up hawk 
silhouettes to scare them away. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep cats inside, especially at night, so they don't become easy prey for 
coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
(This will also save small, wild creatures from felines. Bolger says the 
usually dynamic relationship between prey and predator is upset by what he 
calls a "subsidized predator," one that is fed by humans and can kill wildlife 
at its leisure.) 
</P>
<P>
* Put fiberglass or metal strips around trees so opossums cannot climb up and 
eat the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
* Put up small fences or wrap chicken wire around stakes pounded into the 
ground to keep rabbits from devouring a garden. 
</P>
<P>
* If pigeons and starlings befoul cars parked under trees, either park 
elsewhere or trim trees in late fall. "Trimming at that time will make the 
trees less habitable for the birds during nesting season," said Aguirre. Also, 
it's better for the trees themselves, because they're dormant at that time. 
</P>
<P>
While pigeons and starlings may be an irritant, few creatures evoke the fear 
and dread that rattlesnakes and bats do. In San Diego, they also have a few 
fierce and knowledgeable defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular opinion, rattlesnakes (the only indigenous poisonous snake 
in the county) present only a minor problem, said Richard Plock, president of 
the Herpetological Society of San Diego. Even when bitten, most people recover 
completely if they receive prompt treatment. About 10 people die a year from 
snakebites in the United States, and most were either handling or otherwise 
fooling around with the snakes, according to Plock. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think that all rattlesnakes want to do is lie in wait and bite, 
but that's not true," he said. "The only reason a snake strikes is because it 
feels trapped or that it is being attacked. Given the opportunity, it will get 
away from people." 
</P>
<P>
When residents find rattlesnakes in their yards, Plock said, they should either 
leave them alone -- on the assumption they are only resting and will move along 
if allowed an escape route -- or follow this procedure: Turn a large garbage 
can on its side, push or chase the snake into the can with a long broom, place 
the cover on the can and release the snake elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Rattlesnakes play a beneficial role in nature, but they are often killed by 
people who come upon them, along with other helpful, nonpoisonous snakes that 
are mistaken for rattlers. Plock says gopher snakes (which help control the 
rodent population, as do rattlesnakes) are most often the victims of mistaken 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
Bats also have their defenders, such as Martin Schuler, one of a small group of 
volunteers involved in the San Diego Bat Conservation group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to understand that bats have a place in the scheme of things," 
Schuler said. "They eat 500 to 600 insects in an hour and consume five or six 
times their body weight in one night." 
</P>
<P>
He cites two reasons for fear of bats: rabies and misunderstanding. At dusk, 
when bats come out to feed, they swoop down to catch insects. People sitting 
around a campfire or on their porch swing often assume the darting creatures 
are after them, not bugs. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the fear of rabies, people need to know that if they find any kind of 
dead or sick animal, they should leave it alone," said Schuler, who has studied 
bats for 20 years. "If you find a nocturnal animal crawling around during the 
day, it's important to realize that that's abnormal behavior and that the 
animal is probably sick or hurt. Any wild animal which will allow people to 
come near it or to touch it has something wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
The group's volunteers will pick up grounded bats and give advice on getting 
them out of spaces where they're not wanted. They will also advise people on 
how to attract bats and their insect-controlling skills. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have bats around say they have no insects," Schuler said. "People 
who have lots of insects around may want to try to attract bats by putting up 
bat houses." 
</P>
<P>
Still, most people are more interested in controlling wildlife than attracting 
it. In the vast majority of cases, this can be accomplished by taking care not 
to create a desirable habitat for an undesirable species. The last non-lethal 
resort should be humane trapping, wildlife advocates say. Although the Humane 
Society and other animal welfare groups discourage trapping and the relocation 
of wildlife, sometimes no alternative exists. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of cage or box traps, such as those used to capture feral cats, are 
available. Typically, these are designed so that a trap door closes as soon as 
the animal enters the chamber. The Humane Society recommends that animals be 
released within their home range if at all possible. 
</P>
<P>
Humane trapping is one of the methods used by Critter Control, a national 
company with offices in San Diego County. While most pest-management companies 
still rely on extermination, Critter Control uses ecologically sound methods 
whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
Critter Control's Jim Byers said the company was started several years ago, 
partly in response to budget cuts that curtailed state and local governments' 
abilities to deal with wildlife complaints. Besides removing animals, Critter 
Control repairs damage and installs devices such as chimney caps to keep 
wildlife from returning. 
</P>
<P>
Attitude changes advocated by the Humane Society's Grandy could make trapping 
even less necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's more important to have animals than a picture-perfect yard," said 
Grandy. "The alternative is sterility, life without the song of a bird and the 
yip of a coyote." 
</P>
<P>
He notes that there is very little left in Southern California that could be 
called natural and asks if "freeways, pollution and pesticides are natural?" 
</P>
<P>
To keep what remains wild and natural, humans must create corridors for 
wildlife, said Ted Case, a biology professor at UCSD. Isolating wildlife in 
fragmented canyons has caused extinction, he said. "In order to preserve what's 
left, we shouldn't just be setting aside little pieces; we need to leave 
connections." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bamberger, conservation coordinator for the Sierra Club, says it is not 
too late to create such wild corridors in North County. The alternative is the 
loss of an increasing number of species. 
</P>
<P>
"Species become extinct before we even know what effect their loss will have," 
Bamberger said. "It's like the human body -- when you take away an arm, the 
body still works, but not as well."

STILL KICKING; 
</P>
<P>
AGE IS NO FACTOR WHEN THIS DANCE TROUPE STRUTS ITS STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN SONDAK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It started with the Rockettes, a slick kick-line of long-legged dancers who 
performed precision movements at New York City's plushest movie palace, Radio 
City Music Hall. Then it was the scantily clad glitz-and-glamour showgirls of 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have the Rockerettes, an unlikely ensemble of senior citizens who 
shimmy, shake and tap their toes in unison. This far-from-over-the-hill gang of 
hoofers, led by Joan Settle, is also known as the Las Vegas Girls of North 
County, and its members show no sign of losing their verve. 
</P>
<P>
During 12 years at the helm of the Rockerettes, founder Settle has learned a 
thing or two about leading a dance troupe culled from the ranks of Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't use 'em, you'll lose 'em," the spunky show-biz veteran said. 
Three of Settle's "girls" are octogenarians, and the spring chick in the 
company is over 60. Settle herself is pushing 78. But age doesn't interfere 
with the activities of the Rockerettes. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any accidents," Settle said. "I'm the only one who's ever been 
injured -- I hurt my knee." 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is not real strenuous stuff," she said. "We do kicks, but they're 
only hip high. I work the girls pretty hard, but when they need to rest, they 
can always stop. I don't push them." 
</P>
<P>
Settle said she has been in show business most of her life. "I toured in the 
road company of 'Desert Song' way back when. I was teaching an aerobics class 
in our mobile home park (in Vista), and we decided, why not put our routines 
together and perform?" 
</P>
<P>
The rest may not make show business history, but it has made Settle and her 
10-member troupe a red-hot number on the local touring circuit -- especially 
with other members of the senior set. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the women had never danced before," Settle said. "But we practice 
three or four hours a week, and we've been together so long they're really very 
good. We do chorus line kicks, that kind of thing. We do a complete variety 
show -- tap-dancing, the cancan, soft shoe -- about 16 numbers in all." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Rockerettes may be late bloomers, but there is one seasoned 
trouper in their midst: 62-year-old Gerry O'Dwyer, a former member of the Radio 
City Rockettes. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a long time ago," O'Dwyer said. "I danced with the Rockettes from 
1948 to 1953 -- until I got married -- and I loved every minute of it. We did 
four shows a day, seven days a week in those days (with one week off every 
month), and we were punchy at the end. But I would have paid to work there. We 
really had precision, because you did it over and over. And it was always 
corrected." 
</P>
<P>
The Rockerettes may not deliver drill-team precision, but the group does focus 
on the same style of dancing. And it comes close to replicating the lavish 
costumes seen on big-time stages. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do too many high kicks, but we do line work, and the costumes are 
just beautiful," O'Dwyer said. "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would 
be performing again like this. But then I found Joan 2 1/2 years ago, and it's 
like I died and went to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the audiences for the Rockerettes are seniors themselves. The troupe is 
accustomed to getting a rousing response, Settle said, and it was a hit on TV's 
"PM Magazine." They show up regularly on public broadcasting's KOCT-TV in 
Oceanside as well. The station uses a Rockerettes video two to three times a 
week and all during December with a Christmas show. 
</P>
<P>
"We all love our work," Settle said, "and everyone says we look like we're 
enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
Added O'Dwyer: "We're still little old ladies, but we're a good group." 
</P>
<P>
Additional information on the Rockerettes is available from Joan Settle, 
726-3566.

CLINGING TO THE VINE; 
</P>
<P>
TOMATO GROWERS HAVE LEARNED TO SPECIALIZE TO SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KITTY MORSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In coming weeks, consumers will continue to find vine-ripened North County 
tomatoes plentiful at their grocery stores and roadside produce stands. 
Although tomatoes are produced year-round, this is the natural harvest season. 
</P>
<P>
Even though shoppers should have little trouble finding good tomatoes, North 
County growers in recent years have been committing less and less acreage to 
the crop. Competition among local growers, from Mexican producers and, more 
recently, from land developers, has caused many farmers to roll back tomato 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Still, tomatoes were a $33-million crop in San Diego County last year. To cope 
with the changing market, many growers are limiting their crops to specialty 
tomatoes, such as Romas, that are gaining favor among local consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Yasukochi of Valley Heights Farms in Oceanside is a third-generation 
farmer who has seen his tomato acreage decrease from 800 to 150 over the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor and water costs have gone up so much that we can't compete anymore," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yasukochi specializes in Romas, the medium-size, firm-fleshed plum tomatoes 
grown mainly for canning, as well as the ever-popular cherry tomato. He 
believes the small fruits have the best flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Peterson of Peterson Specialty Produce in Fallbrook agrees with 
Yasukochi on the market slump: "Growing commercial tomatoes is the pits," she 
said. "The bottom has really fallen out of the tomato market in North County." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said she is surviving because she produces only organically grown 
fruit, which is now in great demand. She keeps pests at bay by spraying her 
plants with Safer brand soap or Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that kills 
leaf-eating caterpillars. Both methods are recommended by California Certified 
Organic Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Organic tomatoes are more expensive to produce, but we get a better price for 
them," Peterson said. "Actually, smaller operations like mine, bound for the 
specialty market, are doing better than the larger ones." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's acre of organic tomatoes includes small yellow pears, delicate 
yellow ovals (which are "very sweet") and currant-size reds and yellows, 
favored by restaurant chefs. 
</P>
<P>
"We grow things that are pretty hardy since we're organic," she said. One of 
her favorites is the large Lemon Boy, a sweet, juicy, low-acid variety. 
</P>
<P>
Both Peterson and Yasukochi ship only vine-ripened tomatoes. Most grocery store 
tomatoes are picked early, then given an application of ethylene, a natural gas 
emitted by tomatoes, to induce ripening. Industry specialists hasten to add 
that the process does not alter the tomato's flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Most tomato lovers agree that the best-tasting fruit has been vine-ripened, 
but, since tomatoes bruise easily during handling, shipping it fully ripe is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Tomatoes are ideally suited for the calorie- and cholesterol-conscious. They 
contain no cholesterol, and a tomato weighing 150 grams has only 35 calories 
but 40% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C, and 20% of Vitamin A. 
</P>
<P>
To savor tomatoes at their peak, do not refrigerate them, the California Tomato 
Board says. They will taste best when kept at room temperature (55 to 70 F). 
They can be refrigerated for a few days after fully ripe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
Southern California transit agencies and the Santa Fe Railway have begun 
swapping figures in an attempt to reach a multimillion-dollar deal to purchase 
rail rights of way for commuter and intercity travel. 
</P>
<P>
However, former state Sen. Jim Mills, who heads the Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board and the LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency board of directors, said 
transit negotiators and Santa Fe officials are "far apart" on the price. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, commuter train service is planned along Santa Fe tracks 
between Oceanside and San Diego by early 1993, and between Oceanside and 
Escondido by 1995. Train service between San Diego and Los Angeles also is 
scheduled to be upgraded to allow commuters to use rail transit for their 
morning and evening commutes. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe officials confirmed Wednesday that railroad negotiators had met with a 
number of Southern California agencies Aug. 15 to discuss purchase of the Santa 
Fe right of way from Fullerton south to San Diego, but stressed that the 
railway was not interested in selling its lines north into Los Angeles or in 
allowing greatly increased rail traffic on that segment of the line. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very friendly meeting to discuss areas of mutual interest," said 
Robert Gehrt, Santa Fe vice president for public relations. "We are hopeful we 
can work out an arrangement that will be agreeable to all parties concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that there will be additional meetings from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Santa Fe's Gehrt nor MTDB general manager Tom Larwin would reveal 
appraisal prices or offers made for the railroad right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
Jointly negotiating with the Chicago-based railroad line are LOSSAN (Los 
Angeles-San Diego), the umbrella agency coordinating passenger service on the 
rail corridor between the two cities; San Diego's MTDB, which controls transit 
in southern San Diego County; the North (San 
</P>
<P>
Diego) County Transit District; the San Diego Assn. of Governments; the Orange 
County Transportation Commission and the Los Angeles Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Larwin said the transit agencies banded together in joint negotiations because 
it was felt "we could negotiate from a stronger position jointly." However, he 
added, "if the interests of the individual agencies differ, they may drop out 
and negotiate separately." 
</P>
<P>
Mills said that LOSSAN has hired a consultant, Bob Banks, to represent the 
agency in negotiations and to help appraise the railroad right of way. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Santa Fe wanted to appraise by the "over-the-fence" method, which 
uses the value of the adjacent land as if the tracks could be converted to 
industrial use or ocean-view building lots. Transit groups were seeking to use 
an appraisal method that would base the value on the actual, approved use of 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
The appraisal figures compiled by the railroad and by the transit appraisers 
vary widely, Mills said, and the two sides' estimates of the value of the rail 
line "are far apart." A joint offer made by the rail agencies was not accepted 
by Santa Fe negotiators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mills was not pessimistic about reaching agreement because, he pointed out, 
Santa Fe first broached the idea of selling its Fullerton-San Diego tracks to 
the counties and transit agencies interested in starting passenger lines to 
relieve freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe also is in need of cash to pay a major judgment in a suit it lost over 
a pipeline project. The award against Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the 
parent company of Santa Fe Railway, totaled about $750 million in actual and 
punitive damages when a Texas court found that the corporation and other 
railroads conspired to delay, hinder or stop construction of a 1,700-mile 
pipeline to carry coal slurry -- a mixture of coal and water which can be 
transported long distances by pipeline. Coal now is transported almost 
exclusively by rail. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have the money to deal, and they have the need for cash, I would think 
that we could come to some sort of a meeting of the minds," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that propositions 116 and 108, approved by voters last June, contained 
considerable funds for mass transit and commuter systems. San Diego County also 
has an added half-cent sales tax levy earmarked for road and transit projects.

DISTRICT OKS STUDY ON IMPORTING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District on Wednesday took what Manager John 
Johnson called a "major step" toward deciding northern Ventura County's water 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The district authorized a $235,000 study to evaluate the environmental 
consequences of building an $88-million pipeline to import state water into the 
county. As required by state law, before any project is built, the 
environmental impact study will consider other alternatives to solving the 
area's water crisis, including desalinating seawater and conserving existing 
water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas has budgeted $150,000 for the study, assuming that the United Water 
Conservation District and the city of Ventura will share the cost. However, 
United has declined to participate for now, citing the need for a legal 
agreement on cost-sharing before it proceeds. Ventura has not formally answered 
Casitas' request but is committed to helping pay for the report, Mayor Richard 
Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
"This by no means says that we will opt to import state water," Francis said. 
"But if after we have all the information we do opt for state water, no time 
will have been lost." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the study ordered by Casitas, which serves 55,000 people in the 
Ojai Valley and the west part of Ventura, will for the first time consolidate 
all alternatives into one report that will offer clear choices on whether to 
import state water. 
</P>
<P>
"We're no longer talking about developing alternatives" to solve water 
problems, Johnson said. "We're now talking about picking an alternative, and I 
think that's a major step." 
</P>
<P>
Casitas, like the rest of Ventura County and the state, faces dwindling water 
supplies in the fourth year of a drought. Casitas' water comes from Lake 
Casitas west of the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, Casitas has sought additional water sources, looking mainly to a 
pipeline that would bring state water from Castaic Lake. Castaic, like Pyramid 
Lake to the north, is part of the state water project. The lakes store water 
shipped from Northern California via the state's aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson urged the Casitas board of directors to quickly authorize the study so 
that the district can meet a deadline to bring the final decision to the voters 
in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
If the Casitas board, along with Ventura and possibly United, chooses to import 
state water, voters would be asked to approve a bond or some other means of 
paying the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas board member Al Aviles questioned whether Ventura residents would want 
to continue paying the bill after the drought abates. 
</P>
<P>
"What would happen if Ventura quit buying water from us?" he asked. "Would we 
have to double or triple the rates of the rest of the water users?" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said those consequences will be studied in the report. 
</P>
<P>
United, whose main functions are to regulate pumping from wells and to recharge 
underground water supplies, already has in motion a low-cost plan to bring 
5,000 acre-feet of state water to the county each year, beginning this fall, 
from Pyramid Lake through Lake Piru and the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas and Ventura have declined to receive their combined state water 
allocations of 15,000 acre-feet through natural waterways because the 
high-quality state water would become mixed with local water, which is high in 
mineral content and poor in taste. 
</P>
<P>
United General Manager Frederick J. Gientke said United may yet be interested 
in helping to pay for the environmental report and the pipeline if the cities 
it serves want to share the cost.

RULING FAVORS DEVELOPERS IN OCEANSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: IN A CASE WATCHED NATIONALLY, A JUDGE SAYS THE CITY'S GROWTH CONTROL 
LAW DOES NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE FOR LOWER-INCOME UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a preliminary victory for developers, a Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday 
that Oceanside's growth control law fails to guarantee that the city will 
provide enough lower-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Herbert B. Hoffman also rejected the city's defense against the lawsuit, 
brought by the Building Industry Assn. of San Diego and developer Del Oro 
Hills, that Proposition A has not affected the region's supply of housing. 
</P>
<P>
In his 23-page decision on a case being watched statewide, Hoffman said 
Proposition A "has resulted in an increase in larger-size and higher-priced 
homes not affordable by low-income families." 
</P>
<P>
The building association hailed Hoffman's action, but city representatives 
called it only a temporary setback pending the outcome of a trial over another 
aspect of Proposition A scheduled for October. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this ruling goes more than halfway toward invalidating the ordinance" 
that put Proposition A into law, said Donald Worley, the San Diego attorney for 
the builders. 
</P>
<P>
But Katherine Stone, the Los Angeles lawyer representing the city, said 'the 
court hasn't in any way ruled that Proposition A is invalid." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as a real serious blow at all," Stone said, adding that the 
judge's decision stops short of ordering the city to take any specific action. 
</P>
<P>
The litigation would have ended if Hoffman had upheld Oceanside's view, but his 
decision, signed Tuesday and released Wednesday, means the litigants are 
probably headed for the second trial in October. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Bagley said the City Council will decide in a closed-door session 
next week what to do next about Proposition A. "I'm told by our attorney we 
don't really have much choice except to keep defending it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Oceanside has spent $1.5 million on the legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said she probably will recommend that the council authorize her to file a 
motion asking Hoffman to reconsider based on "some factual errors that are 
significant" in reaching his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside's voters approved Proposition A on the April, 1987, city ballot, 
limiting residential construction to 800 units a year. 
</P>
<P>
The city is allowed by Proposition A to increase or decrease the annual 
allotment by 10% during any year to correct any imbalance from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Proposition A passed, 10 developers sued. Nine of them eventually 
dropped their suits, leaving the association and Del Oro Hills to join forces. 
</P>
<P>
Another developer, Cromwell Ranch, is also suing the city, but has agreed to 
abide by Hoffman's decision in the association-Del Oro Hills case. 
</P>
<P>
During a 3 1/2-day trial in early June, the city maintained it has had a 
superior record of approving new housing to help meet Oceanside's regional 
share, as determined by the San Diego Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
City representatives testified that 2,314 units for poverty-level residents and 
3,523 for lower- to moderate-income people had been provided since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
They argued that all the approved new units satisfied the city's burden under 
state law requiring cities' growth plans to have no negative impact on the 
supply of housing in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman agreed, but only to a point. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote that the evidence "clearly established that the city has met its 
regional share of new residential housing units for the period from 1966 to 
'91." 
</P>
<P>
The judge also found that the city will continue meeting its total housing goal 
through 1996, the next housing planning period. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a critical decision, Hoffman sided with the building association and 
Del Oro Hills that "the city will not be able to meet its future regional share 
of housing in all income categories." 
</P>
<P>
Although he agreed the city is exceeding its regional share of affordable 
units, Hoffman pointed out that many of those building permits were approved 
years before Proposition A became law. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the court concludes the city's approach is too simplistic and distorts 
the more important analysis concerning the availability of affordable housing . 
. . " he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Further, "the court agrees with the (association's) position that, when 
Proposition A took full effect in 1988, affordable housing in the city took a 
dramatic decline," the judge concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside had pointed out that it has programs, subsidies and exemptions to 
Proposition A to help increase availability of affordable housing, but Hoffman 
said the city was unable to convince him that those steps would generate enough 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Worley, the association's attorney, said Hoffman's findings will serve as a 
warning to other cities with laws limiting the number of building permits 
issued annually. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd better think more than twice before they adopt building permit caps," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stone faulted the judge's decision, saying factual errors led him to a 
flawed conclusion. Among other things, she said, he "incorrectly felt" the 
city's program to encourage affordable housing was no longer in effect. 
</P>
<P>
So she wants to ask Hoffman to reconsider. The city cannot take the matter to 
the Court of Appeal, unless a special writ is sought, until the second phase of 
the litigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside can go ahead with the trial in October or take an alternative course, 
such as changing its growth control law to require all major developments to 
include affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bagley said: "I want to know what are our real options. Do we have to 
continue (to fight)? I think the answer to that is yes." 
</P>
<P>
The October trial would focus on whether Proposition A is necessary under state 
law to the health and safety of the city. The issue of punitive damages for Del 
Oro Hills would come up then.

CUP ORGANIZERS WANT TO ADD ARTS FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoped-for events surrounding the 1992 America's Cup sailing regatta include a 
lavish, multimillion-dollar arts festival similar to last year's Soviet arts 
festival and the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles, Cup organizers said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even before being granted the $10 million in public money the America's Cup 
Organizing Committee is seeking from the San Diego Unified Port District -- 
half the group's operating budget -- racing officials outlined a broad series 
of programs designed to make 1992, in the words of one, a "colossal" year in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"In January of '92, we hope to have a festival of performance, involving 
theater and dance," said Dave McGuigan, vice president in charge of marketing 
for the organizing committee. "In February, we hope to have a festival of 
music; in March, a festival of food; in April, a festival of sport, and later, 
as we near the finals (in May, 1992), a festival of visual art." 
</P>
<P>
McGuigan and Tom Ehman, head of the organizing committee, said Cup officials 
have been meeting with representatives of the San Diego Commission for Arts and 
Culture as well as members of Mayor Maureen O'Connor's staff. McGuigan said 
meetings are also planned with officials from the San Diego Symphony and the 
Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the intense planning, he said, the America's Cup arts agenda would "in 
no way" conflict with the triennial city arts festival, already scheduled for 
the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the two festivals pose almost a full year of international arts 
activity in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
McGuigan said the organizing committee hopes its endeavor is "on the magnitude 
of" the Soviet arts festival and the '84 Olympic Arts Festival, but 
distinguished it from the city festival, "which will have as its focus the arts 
-- and just the arts -- as opposed to ours, which will offer secondary 
activities to America's Cup racing." 
</P>
<P>
McGuigan and an organizing committee colleague, Peter Litrenta, listed the 
London Symphony Orchestra, the Tokyo Philharmonic and the Milan Opera, as well 
as major art exhibits and theatrical companies from around the world, as the 
types of organizations and events Cup organizers hope to attract. 
</P>
<P>
McGuigan said the reason for the arts festival, as well as other ancillary 
events, is to give "local people who have no interest in sailing the 
impression, long after the race has gone, that, indeed, it was a good thing for 
the city of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Funding, however, will have to come from a public agency -- the Port District, 
which has yet to award the America's Cup a penny. Ehman, the head of the 
organizing committee, said at a Wednesday press conference that he has been 
meeting with officials of the port staff and hopes to appeal "within the next 
few weeks" to the Board of Port Commissioners for the $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Port commissioners have voted in principle to assist the organizing committee, 
but have not promised anything in terms of money. In interviews, several have 
cited outstanding and costly litigation against the Port District, including 
lawsuits over pollution in San Diego Bay and jet noise emanating from Lindbergh 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
Those suits could total hundreds of millions of dollars, which commissioners 
often cite in counteracting public inquiries about the $40 million a year in 
port revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the $10 million would pay for construction of a media center and an 
America's Cup "village," as well as a museum, and, of course, the arts 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor O'Connor, who conceived and promoted the 
Soviet arts festival, said last year's event cost $6 million, half of which 
came from the city's transient occupancy tax. Downey said the festival "made 
back" about $2.8 million, meaning the actual expenditure of occupancy-tax money 
amounted to no more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cup official Litrenta said a local delegation recently visited Seattle for that 
city's Goodwill Games, which included an arts festival. He said Seattle 
received money from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities, as well as the United States Information Agency 
-- funding sources the Cup committee is hoping to tap for its arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore Giametta, another member of O'Connor's staff, who works closely with 
the San Diego Commission on Arts and Culture, said the San Diego Convention 
&amp; Visitors' Bureau and the Greater San Diego Hotel &amp; Motel Assn. 
recently requested that the city arts festival occur no earlier than the fall, 
so as not to conflict with America's Cup events -- including its arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it's highly unlikely that the city festival would be part of 
any Cup-sponsored event," Giametta said. "I don't believe they'd be in 
competition, though. . . . It may be a matter of semantics when the Cup people 
use the word festival, because what it sounds like to me is events that would 
highlight, or represent diversions from, America's Cup racing, whereas, the 
city festival would be a celebration only of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
He said the visitors' bureau and the hotel and motel group wanted the city 
festival in the fall "because they're already assured of a windfall of business 
in the spring and summer and wanted to do what they could to boost the fall. I 
think they're hoping the city festival does that." 
</P>
<P>
Giametta disputed the notion that San Diego is in danger of a glut of leisure 
activity in 1992, although he conceded, "An incredible amount is going on." 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup Equestrian Championships in Rancho Sante Fe and the Baseball 
All-Star Game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium are also scheduled for that 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Any way you look at it," he said, "this will be a hopping town. How will we 
ever be the same again?"

EX-CITY MANAGER TAKES SALINAS POST

<P>
David Mora, forced to end his tenure as Oxnard city manager July 1 after five 
years, has been hired as city manager of Salinas, beating out 13 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Mora, who was ousted on a 3-2 vote by the Oxnard City Council, will be the 
first Latino to hold the $95,000-a-year job of managing Salinas' 550 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos make up about 50% of the population in both Salinas and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Mora, 45, assumes his new job Sept. 10 and may earn up to a $6,000 raise in 
salary within six months if the Salinas City Council is happy with his work. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Herte, current city manager of Salinas, said Mora's firing was unimportant. 
"As a city manager, it's unusual to find someone who hasn't been fired at one 
time or another. When you're at the pleasure of an ever-changing City Council 
with a predetermined agenda, it's very easy to be fired. All they have to do is 
say they are no longer pleased, and you're looking for a new job." LAURA PITTER

For Latino students in an Oxnard tutoring program, the study of Mayan temples 
offers more than a lesson in Central American culture. 
</P>
<P>
The Semillas del Futuro (Seeds of the Future) Project teaches mathematics using 
calculations employed in building the temples. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer tutors also use Latino culture to teach science, reading and English. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to raise self-esteem, confidence and knowledge of their background 
along with academic skills," said Luzmaria Espinosa, youth services coordinator 
for El Concilio del Condada del Ventura, which established the project six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp. recently contributed $4,000 to the program, designed to stem the 
high school dropout rates among Latino children in the Oxnard area. 
</P>
<P>
Between 30 and 45 elementary and junior high students were tutored the last 
school year. The students' parents are required to participate by leading 
informal lessons or arts and crafts projects, serving on an advisory committee 
or doing administrative work. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

COUNCIL APPROVES FARMERS MARKET

<P>
Charitable organizations will be allowed to organize a farmers market to raise 
funds, the Camarillo City Council decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo Hospice and the Pleasant Valley Hospital Auxiliary have contacted 
more than 75 farmers, said Jane Rozanski, executive director of Camarillo 
Hospice. 
</P>
<P>
Money raised at the market will be used for the care of terminally ill patients 
and equipment for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this is an idea whose time has come," Rozanski said. "Camarillo is an 
agricultural center, and there is a very special feeling of community here. We 
thought it would be great to get the community together on a Saturday morning 
where people can buy fresh produce and meet with their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Named the Camarillo Certified Farmers Market because produce will be certified 
by the county's agricultural commissioner, the market is expected to be 
operating by January in the parking lot of the Senior Nutrition Center on 
Ventura Boulevard. Approval for the site must still be arranged with the 
county. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

CITY MAY QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVE PLAN

<P>
Oxnard officials believe that their city qualifies for a state Department of 
Commerce program that provides tax incentives for businesses in an economically 
depressed area. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to City Manager Vernon G. Hazen, Economic Development Officer Linda 
Guillis said that "based on preliminary information from the state, Oxnard 
meets the major eligibility criteria for the establishment of a zone." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's qualifications include its commitment to promoting new business and 
industry, and its high unemployment rate and low median income level in certain 
neighborhoods near downtown, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the memo released last week, Guillis said the program would attract 
businesses and help create jobs that bring additional revenues to the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, she warned that the city would probably compete with as many as 100 
other cities for inclusion in the program. Eight cities will be chosen to be in 
the program, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to consider an application for the program Sept.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY CONSIDERS PENALTY FOR SACRIFICE OF 
ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Los Angeles City Council members wants to make the ritual sacrifice 
of animals a crime punishable by a fine up to $1,000 and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Richard Alatorre, Hal Bernson and Nate Holden, serving on the 
council's Public Safety Committee, have approved a measure that would make 
animal sacrifice a misdemeanor. The full council must vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is no municipal law against people sacrificing animals in 
religious ceremonies, officials said. To prosecute someone under state law, 
suffering by the animal must be proven, City Atty. James Hahn said.

CONSERVANCY FUNDS HELP RIDING CENTER 
</P>

The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy gave the city of Agoura Hills $600,000 
to help it acquire and build a $1.25-million park and equestrian center, a 
conservancy spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Only a portion of the project will be funded with the grant, but city officials 
said they are optimistic about future money coming from the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
Besides funding, the project is dependent upon the city approving a trade of 
the 2.72-acre Agoura Park for a nearby 10.1-acre undeveloped parcel of land 
known as the Stroud property, where the Lower Cheeseboro Canyon Equestrian 
Center will be built, said Rorie Skei, conservancy project manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheeseboro Development Group, which plans to sell the Stroud property to 
the city for a $125,000 price differential after it buys the property from 
Chuck Stroud, wants to build 62 1,100- to 1,300-square-foot condominiums on the 
Agoura Park property, said Dave Carmany, Agoura Hills City Manager. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is in escrow now, but the deal will not go through unless the 
Cheeseboro Development Group gets city approval to build on the property, 
Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lower Cheeseboro Canyon Equestrian Center is built one block away from 
the 35-year-old park, it will have baseball fields, playgrounds, basketball 
courts, recreation and craft buildings and an equestrian center, said Joe 
Donofrio, Agoura Hills director of parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has been approved by the city planning department and the 
architectural review board but still needs the approval of the city Planning 
Commission and the City Council, Donofrio said. LAURA PITTER

OFFICIALS SHIFT MONORAIL PLAN TO FREEWAY MEDIAN; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: A COMMISSION APPROVES THE SWITCH AFTER CALTRANS EXPRESSES 
SAFETY CONCERNS OVER COLUMNS ALONGSIDE RAMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County transportation officials Wednesday unveiled a new version of 
a proposed monorail along the Ventura Freeway, scrapping a plan to study a line 
along the freeway's southern edge in favor of a route down the center median. 
</P>
<P>
The county Transportation Commission's vote to approve the switch came after 
Caltrans officials had warned that the columns supporting the elevated system 
might be hit by vehicles and damaged if placed as planned in the narrow 
triangular spaces between the freeway and its on- and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout was the latest chapter in a long struggle over what type of 
east-west rail line -- if any -- might be built in the San Fernando Valley, in 
addition to the Metro Rail line planned to run between downtown and North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
County officials in March favored a 5.6-mile westward subway extension to the 
San Diego Freeway along the Southern Pacific's Burbank branch right of way. 
</P>
<P>
But they also agreed to study a Ventura Freeway monorail system such as the one 
overwhelmingly favored by Valley voters in a June referendum. 
</P>
<P>
"If the project can be kept relatively simple, and the linkages between the 
proposed monorail and other systems worked out, the potential exists that the 
monorail alternative could be competitive with the subway alternatives," 
commission Executive Director Neil Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials originally had been looking toward a monorail line on the 
southern edge of the freeway, with the route flaring outward from the freeway 
to avoid crossing over on- and off-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
But they later agreed to study a route with its guideway and stations over the 
ramp areas. 
</P>
<P>
The latest switch could be bad news for the hundreds of thousands of commuters 
who drive the freeway, since the monorail system might use some of the center 
median areas where Caltrans is now widening the freeway to provide additional 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we could take a lane away," said Lew Bedolla, a Caltrans deputy 
district director in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ultimate resolution would be part of the study, Bedolla said 
Caltrans could consider narrowing the freeway lanes or widening its outside 
edges as alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who proposed the monorail concept 
more than two years ago, the line would run 16.5 miles along the freeway from 
Universal City to Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have estimated that it could cost $1.6 billion.

BURBANK HOSPITAL LURES SURGEON FROM ST. VINCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Taro Yokoyama, one of the leading heart surgeons in California, will direct 
a $5-million state-of-the-art cardiac surgery program at St. Joseph Medical 
Center in Burbank that will have new operating rooms and a pediatric intensive 
care unit built to his exact specifications. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, most high-risk patients from the San Fernando Valley were referred 
to the County-USC or UCLA medical centers, Good Samaritan Hospital or 
Yokoyama's team at St. Vincent Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among the operations Yokoyama performs are multiple valve replacements, 
pediatric heart surgeries and procedures to preserve tissue after heart 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama will continue operating at St. Vincent but has expanded his 
specialized medical team so the group can also perform surgery at St. Joseph 
Medical Center, said Vincent Guinan, president of St. Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph administrator James Sauer said attracting Yokoyama will help the 
hospital achieve its goal of creating two "major centers of excellence," one in 
cancer treatment and one in heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Four heart surgeons are already on the staff at St. Joseph, performing about 
125 operations a year at the 647-bed Catholic hospital, Sauer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly double that volume and maybe triple it as the program gets 
going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama's team of 10 surgeons and 15 anesthesiologists, surgical and intensive 
care nurses and physicians' assistants will begin working at St. Joseph on 
Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
After Yokoyama was selected by a hospital search committee to direct the heart 
surgery program six months ago, negotiations began to accommodate the surgeon's 
requirements, Sauer said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital agreed to build two additional operating rooms, renovate its 
existing rooms and add a cardiac catheterization laboratory and a pediatric 
intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital also will equip all the rooms with specialized instruments and 
will retrain staff members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama also specified changes in the lighting, air-conditioning and humidity 
levels in the cardiac surgery and intensive care units, Sauer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, we had to work with Dr. Yokoyama to produce the heart surgery 
environment he functions best in," Sauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama, 56, received his medical degree and a Ph.D. in physiology from 
Okayama University Medical School in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
He received further surgical training at Georgetown University Medical Center 
in Washington and at County-USC Medical Center before becoming a kidney 
transplantation specialist at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
His reputation as a cardiac surgeon was achieved at St. Vincent Medical Center, 
beginning in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he and his team performed 750 open-heart surgeries, nearly five times 
the number required of members of the American College of Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
The team's 3% mortality rate is considerably below the 5% statewide average, 
despite the complexity of the cases the team accepts, state health statistics 
show. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at the Los Angeles chapter of the American Heart Assn. said 
Yokoyama and his team are "very well-known, and very highly respected." 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama was in surgery and could not be reached for comment.

FAIR PLANS NEW EVENTS IN BID TO BEST 1989'S RECORD ATTENDANCE 
</P>

Organizers are counting on new events such as pig racing, llama judging and a 
show of experimental aircraft to help the 52nd annual Antelope Valley Fair and 
Alfalfa Festival, which opens Friday in Lancaster, to match an attendance 
record set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Theme for the 11-day event, the largest yearly public gathering in the high 
desert, is "It's a Barnyard Jamboree." Organizers say they hope to match last 
year's attendance of 188,212 despite a downturn in the economy and a 50-cent 
boost in the adult admission price to $4. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the publicly sponsored fair is an oddball collection of events. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled are produce and livestock competitions that reflect the valley's 
agricultural roots, rides and games, a demolition derby, a rural Olympics, 
rodeos and a week of concerts, headlined by country singer Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Many events have evolved into something akin to rituals, but there are new 
touches as well. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Manager Jim Pacini said new events are pig races at Hollypig Park, a llama 
judging competition and a display long-sought by aerospace enthusiasts in the 
valley of experimental aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pacini said the fair's nine-member governing board has created a 
new Little Barnyard area for children that will have free puppet and magic 
shows, a petting zoo, treasure hunts, and watermelon and marshmallow eating 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
Fair activities get under way Friday with a 5:30 p.m. parade down Lancaster 
Boulevard from 10th Street West to Sierra Highway. The 80-acre fairgrounds at 
East Avenue I and Division Street open at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Fair hours are 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday, noon to 1 a.m. Saturday, noon to 
midnight Sunday, 3 to 11:30 p.m. Monday, and 4 to 11:30 p.m. Tuesday through 
Aug. 30. Next weekend, hours are 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. Aug. 31, noon to 1 a.m. Sept. 
1 and 2, and noon to 11 p.m. Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
Daily admission is $4 for adults, and $2 for youngsters ages 6 to 16 and senior 
citizens. Children under 6 and military personnel in uniform get in free. Added 
charges include $2 a day for parking and the price of tickets to concerts and 
the various track events. 
</P>
<P>
Special prices will be in effect for Family Day on Sunday, when two parents and 
up to four children will get in for $10. Children 12 and under will be admitted 
free Monday, handicapped individuals will get in without charge Tuesday, and 
people 60 and older will be allowed in free Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No serious crimes or injuries occurred during last year's event, and fair 
officials are hoping for the same this year. 
</P>
<P>
Beer and wine sales, which are a major fund-raiser, will continue. But there 
will be no cigarette giveaway booth, a plan fair officials canceled last year 
after protests. 
</P>
<P>
About 8,900 of the 9,700 tickets to Rogers' Aug. 31 concert have been sold; 
only $10 tickets remain. 
</P>
<P>
Other concerts include Michael McDonald and Belinda Carlisle on Monday, Eddie 
Rabbitt and Juice Newton on Tuesday, Tommy Page and Sweet Sensation on 
Wednesday, and Jan and Dean and Paul Revere and the Raiders on Aug. 30. The 
concerts begin at 8 p.m. Tickets range from $8 to $14. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for track events, such as stock car racing Friday, motocross and a 
tractor pull Saturday, and motorcycle racing and a demolition derby Sunday, run 
$6 to $8. Admission to the Rural Olympics and three days of rodeo next weekend 
is $6 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
Pigeon judging will occur 9 a.m. Friday before the fair's formal opening. 
</P>
<P>
The pig races will occur throughout the fair's run. 
</P>
<P>
The llama competition is set Friday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Satellite wagering on horse races, which occurs year-round at the fairgrounds, 
will continue through the fair's run.

SCHOOL DISTRICT JOINS RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a continuing effort to ease the flow of garbage into landfills, the Simi 
Valley City Council has voted to include the Simi Valley School District in its 
office-paper recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Williams, the school district's recycling coordinator, said she first 
talked with city officials about participating in the program about a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the district's participation on Monday. Williams said it 
would be easier for the district to join the city's program than to start its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no point in us reinventing the wheel," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the program will be limited to district offices and that 
collection services are expected to begin in a few weeks. The district may 
decide later to expand the office-paper recycling program to its schools, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Davis-Crompton, director of the city's Department of Environmental 
Services, said the city will ship 200 cardboard collection boxes with 
instructions about the program to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Davis-Crompton said the district's participation will not cost the city extra 
money and will benefit everyone. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the Simi Valley City Council approved the pilot program for 
office-paper recycling at City Hall. City officials said the program cost 
$1,200 to start and about $2,300 to operate annually. 
</P>
<P>
But savings in trash collection charges and the sale of recyclable paper are 
expected to generate $2,850 a year for the city, which will more than 
compensate for the operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Recyclable paper constitutes about 90% of the trash generated by City Hall 
offices, according to a city staff report. Fax paper, computer paper and 
envelopes make up a large portion of the materials. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Government Center and Ventura and Thousand Oaks have similar 
recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
A recent state law requires that cities devise plans by the end of the year to 
reduce the flow of trash into landfills by 25% by 1995 and by 50% by the turn 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to meet that goal, the Simi Valley City Council voted to 
expand its curbside recycling program in July from 13,000 households to include 
all 26,000 single-family residences. CARLOS LOZANO

DEUKMEJIAN BELATEDLY JOINS EFFORT TO KEEP AIR BASE IN EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After maintaining a low profile on the issue for months, Gov. George Deukmejian 
has joined the drive to keep the 3,200-employee Air Force Space Systems 
Division in El Segundo, officials close to the governor say. 
</P>
<P>
The officials say the state is now studying how it can help ease a shortage of 
low-cost housing for local Air Force personnel, a key problem underlying the 
service's tentative plan to move its space unit from the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local business leader says Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has 
agreed to consider turning city land over to the Air Force for low-cost housing 
as part of an effort to head off the proposed move. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Iacobellis, a Rockwell International executive who chairs an aerospace 
panel for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, said the mayor give him the 
assurance Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the mayor said he could not confirm that such a proposal is in 
the works, but he added that Bradley's office has begun studying how to help 
keep the space division in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has discussed moving the base elsewhere in California, as well as 
to Colorado or New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and Bradley's involvement comes as a boost to a bipartisan lobbying 
effort against a transfer of the Space Systems Division, which oversees 
research, planning and procurement of military space hardware. 
</P>
<P>
If the move occurs, it would probably also involve the transfer of the 
4,000-employee Aerospace Corp., a nonprofit think tank in El Segundo that works 
closely with the space division. Losing the two units would be a major blow to 
the Los Angeles area's struggling aerospace industry, chamber and local 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Aside from the immediate impact of over 7,000 lost jobs, the indirect costs in 
jobs and lost revenue for the aerospace sector are staggering," U.S. Rep. Mel 
Levine (D-Santa Monica), said at a press conference Tuesday in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force announced in January that it might close Los Angeles Air Force 
Base -- the site of the space system division -- and transfer the space unit 
elsewhere as part of a drive to cut defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the governor took a hands-off approach to avoid favoring El Segundo 
over the other in-state sites that the Air Force is considering as alternatives 
-- March AFB near Riverside and Vandenberg AFB near Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of two out-of-state sites in contention -- Colorado Springs, 
Colo., and Albuquerque, N.M. -- are waging aggressive lobbying campaigns for 
the division. And they enjoy strong backing from their respective governors -- 
Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico and Roy Romer of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say Deukmejian is now concerned that unless he works actively to keep 
the space division in El Segundo, there is a good chance it will be shifted out 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent that the best way to keep (the division) in California 
is to try and keep it right where it is," said John Geoghegan, secretary of the 
state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency. "If the Air Force decides it 
is going to be moved, the out-of-state locations will become very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Gibson, director of the state Department of Commerce, says the governor 
will try to keep the space division in California if the Air Force decides that 
a transfer has to take place. Deukmejian's next choice for the base would be 
March AFB, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the assurance does not satisfy the Inland Empire Space Systems Division 
Relocation Group, a business coalition pushing hard for the March AFB site.

Stephen Albright, the group's chairman, says he fears that California will lose 
the space division if the state wastes time and money trying to keep the unit 
in a place that has proved unsatisfactory to the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
He notes that the Air Force is dissatisfied not only with housing prices in the 
Los Angeles area, but also with the high cost of services, traffic congestion 
and the high price of land for future expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"There are reasons why businesses are leaving the (Los Angeles) area, and it is 
cost-related," Albright said. "We can't just gloss these problems over."

The Air Force has scheduled a public hearing on the environmental impact of 
closing the base for 7 p.m. Monday in the El Segundo High School auditorium. 
Air Force Secretary Donald Rice is expected to announce his final 
recommendation on Los Angeles Air Force Base in December. Any decision to close 
the base would have to be approved by Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and 
later by Congress.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFF-ROAD PATROLS BEEFED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council this week approved paying the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department up to $2,800 to add off-road motorcycle patrols to 
its enforcement program on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The figure is about 60% of the cost of the program; the remainder has already 
been allocated by Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates, which also contract 
with the Sheriff's Department for police protection. 
</P>
<P>
The off-road program, which was implemented about a month ago, was added 
because of an increase in illegal off-road use and dumping, said officials. A 
sheriff's spokesman said numerous citations have already been issued. 
</P>
<P>
Nine deputies have been trained for the program, which is similar to one at the 
Sheriff's Malibu Station.

MAN HELD, ACCUSED OF BANK ROBBERY SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following a four-day stakeout, a 10-person team of FBI agents and plainclothes 
police officers on Wednesday nabbed a Ventura man suspected of the year's 
biggest one-man bank robbery spree. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Charles Poynter, 31, was arrested on suspicion of bank robbery outside 
the Ventura office of Santa Barbara Savings and Loan, 3620 Telegraph Road, 
after a morning pursuit involving more than a dozen marked and unmarked police 
cars. Also arrested was Julian Delgado, 29, of El Rio, who is suspected of 
being Poynter's driver. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a crowd at the end," Ventura Police Sgt. Roger Nustad said. "There 
was just a pileup of police cars at the culmination of the arrest." 
</P>
<P>
A few dozen people gathered to watch, he added, while officers scattered to 
interview bank tellers and other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI suspects Poynter in eight area bank robberies since July and two 
attempted robberies. The robber scrawled notes on Manila envelopes demanding 
money and threatening that he had a gun, said Gary Auer, special agent in the 
FBI's Ventura bureau. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Poynter and Delgado could face up to 20 years in prison and 
$5,000 fines for each robbery, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Police detectives and FBI agents teamed up to watch Poynter's home in the 300 
block of Anacapa Street beginning Saturday about 6:30 a.m. For four days they 
followed him to and from friends' houses and on shopping errands. On Wednesday, 
Poynter and Delgado stopped at 1st Nationwide Bank, 1190 S. Victoria Ave., 
about 11 a.m. but left without incident, Nustad said. 
</P>
<P>
The men then drove to Santa Barbara Savings and Loan followed by seven unmarked 
police cars, which parked on side streets and in the bank parking lot, Nustad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Poynter "came out of the bank on a dead run with some object in his hands. It 
turned out to be a folder with some money," Nustad said, adding that it held 
about $800. Delgado was in the car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe Santa Barbara Savings and Loan is the eighth bank robbed by 
Poynter. 
</P>
<P>
He is suspected in robberies Aug. 13 at World Savings and Loan Assn., 11 E. 
Ponderosa Drive, Camarillo; Aug. 10 at Santa Barbara Savings and Loan, 425 
Arneil Road, Camarillo; Aug. 9 at the Bank of A. Levy, 1830 Victoria Ave., 
Oxnard; Aug. 1 at the World Savings &amp; Loan Assn. at 2704 E. Thompson Blvd., 
Ventura; July 28 at 1st Nationwide Bank, 1055 S. Oxnard Blvd., Oxnard; and July 
26 at Security Pacific National Bank, 9493 Telephone Road, Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
They also suspect him of a robbery in northern Santa Barbara County on Aug. 14 
and two robbery attempts in July and August in Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI declined to say how much money Poynter is suspected of taking during 
the robberies this summer. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 13 a packet of purple dye exploded on the strawberry-blond robber. 
</P>
<P>
At the bank Wednesday, the teller gave the robber a dye packet, "and he threw 
it back at her," Nustad said.

SENATE OKS NEW PROCESS FOR STATE APPROVAL OF DUMPS; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILLS: SEN. ED DAVIS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN HIS BID TO AMEND THE MEASURE TO 
GIVE CITIES A STRONGER VOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill establishing a new process for winning state approval for garbage dumps 
has been passed by the state Senate, but without provisions sought by Sen. Ed 
Davis (R-Santa Clarita) that would have given cities a stronger voice in such 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had hoped to amend the bill to give Santa Clarita more influence over 
plans to open a dump in Elsmere Canyon, just outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
Davis unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese 
(D-San Jose), which was passed by the Senate on a 22-12 vote Monday. The bill, 
AB 2296, goes back to the Assembly for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and the Santa Clarita City Council objected to provisions of the bill 
that, they said, weakened the city's chances of blocking the proposed Elsmere 
Canyon landfill. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and Los Angeles 
City Council support the landfill, and an environmental impact report on the 
project is being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Cortese bill, a landfill proposal would have to be endorsed by a 
majority of cities in a county before it could be submitted to the California 
Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Fennessey, a Davis aide, said this week that this provision makes it 
appear that Santa Clarita, or any other city opposed to a dump, could garner 
the support of other cities to block such a proposal. But the protection 
offered by that provision is largely illusory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cortese bill also says a city may vote against such a proposal only if it 
can prove that the dump would have adverse impacts within its own boundaries. 
Santa Clarita and Los Angeles are the only municipalities near Elsmere Canyon 
so the young city obviously could not rally other cities in the county to fight 
the proposed dump, Fennessey said. 
</P>
<P>
Fennessey said Cortese's bill contains some good elements, including provisions 
to safeguard the environment. But the guarantees of local involvement in the 
approval process do not really give cities a say in the selection of a landfill 
site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bill was a political defeat for the Santa Clarita council, which 
had lobbied against the measure. Santa Clarita had tried to generate support 
for a bill by Davis, SB 2139, which would have made it more difficult for the 
city and county of Los Angeles to win state approval for their landfill plans. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Santa Clarita City Council took the unusual step of running 
full-page newspaper ads encouraging residents to write and telephone the 
members of an Assembly committee considering SB 2139. The bill had passed the 
Senate in May but was tabled after it ran into opposition in the Assembly.

TORRANCE UNPLUGS MOBILE PHONE TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance city officials thought they had conjured up a modern means of raising 
money. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, they decided to impose a new tax on the use of mobile telephones, 
figuring it would generate an extra $20,000 a year for city coffers. 
Mobile-phone users with a Torrance billing address were to pay a city tax of 6% 
on their phone calls originating from or terminating in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, less than two months after the tax went into effect, the City 
Council postponed the idea indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, it seems, is that billing technology has not kept pace with 
telephone technology: Mobile telephone companies cannot determine exactly where 
a call originates. And although they can discern the prefix of the telephone 
number called, those prefixes cross city boundaries and do not show that the 
call necessarily went to Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Computer software is available to collect that information, but Benjamin J. 
Murdoch, the city's revenue administrator, said the city was told it might have 
to pay as much as $15,000 for software for each of 25 or 30 cellular telephone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
That did not seem efficient for a tax that would collect only $20,000 a year, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd cost you a dollar to capture a dime," said Neil Fitzpatrick, director of 
external affairs for PacTel Cellular, which operates a five-county cellular 
telephone system in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we sliced it down, the less and less revenue it was, and the more 
complicated it was," Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
So the tax has been on hold, said City Finance Director Mary Giordano, "until 
there's a better mechanism to track phone calls. And when that is, is anyone's 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
City officials intended the new tax to be an extension of the 6% utility users' 
tax that the city already levies on regular telephone, gas, water, electricity 
and cable television use, Murdoch said. 
</P>
<P>
The city mailed letters to several mobile telephone companies, informing them 
that the tax was under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't happy about it, but they said, 'Fine, as long as you only do it 
for Torrance residents. Don't try to tax the resident of someplace else 
traveling through Torrance,' " Murdoch said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax went into effect July 1, the start of the city's fiscal year. But early 
this month, city officials said, they discovered the flaw in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that any Torrance mobile phone users actually have been taxed 
the 6% by their cellular telephone company, Murdoch said. But if companies have 
charged the tax, he said, "We'd tell them, 'Just give it back.' "

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SLAIN BY PAIR WAITING AT APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank man was fatally shot Wednesday morning by two gunmen who were waiting 
for him when he and his wife drove into a parking space outside their 
apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Salazar, 37, was shot once in the head as he sat in his car in the 700 
block of East Cedar Avenue about 12:30 a.m., Burbank Police Sgt. Don Goldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He died an hour later at Burbank Community Hospital. His wife, Cecilia, was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had no motive for the slaying, Goldberg said. Salazar was 
returning home after being picked up from work by his wife in the Echo Park 
area of Los Angeles. When they arrived at their apartment, two men in a small 
white truck approached the car and fired at Salazar before fleeing. Goldberg 
said it appears the gunmen were waiting specifically for Salazar.

An automobile overturned on a Canoga Park street Wednesday morning, killing the 
driver and leaving a passenger unhurt, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 3:50 a.m. in the 8500 block of Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard. The victim, a 23-year-old Sherman Oaks man whose identity was not 
released, died at the scene. Officer Leona Thomas said the car was headed south 
when the driver lost control as he reached across the dashboard to adjust the 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
The car hit the center divider, crossed back across the southbound lanes, hit a 
light pole and overturned on the front lawn of a house. A passenger, a 
17-year-old Canoga Park boy who was not identified, was not injured.

L.A. COUNTY REDISTRICTING PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was only one major flaw in your editorial "Slow Down and Get It Right" 
(Aug. 18) regarding the redistricting for the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The three-man conservative majority on the board is not now nor has it ever 
been ready to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
It is content to squander millions of taxpayer dollars on this and other 
lawsuits. It has an unlimited fund of money (the taxpayers), so why not? If 
these men had to use their own personal funds, they would be reasonable and try 
to reach an equitable settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Those millions of dollars belong to the people of Los Angeles County and should 
have been used to promote the people's welfare, education and mental 
well-being. Five supervisors for a county the size of Los Angeles is absurd. 
The Los Angeles City Council has more members.

L.A. COUNTY REDISTRICTING PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fact that the fight over fair representation on the Board of Supervisors 
represented "politics at its most arrogant" was about the only correct 
statement in Ronald B. Turovsky's analysis ("Drawn and Quartered, but Still 
Looking Out for No. 1," Commentary, Aug. 6). 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, working hand-in-hand with MALDEF and the 
ACLU, did indeed carve out a district shaped like a donkey in a blatantly 
political effort to create a liberal Democratic district for City Councilwoman 
Gloria Molina. It is not a coincidence that Molina, a member of the MALDEF 
board, wants to run for the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Judge Kenyon would deny the people a voice in the drafting of new 
lines and the fact that Sarah Flores, a Latina Republican, was the odds-on 
favorite to win a board seat in November, underlines the real 
Kenyon-MALDEF-ACLU agenda: the creation of a tailor-made district for an 
ultra-liberal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
That is politics at its most crass. 
</P>
<P>
Neither The Times nor Turovsky bothered to note that a liberal Democrat 
majority dominated the Board of Supervisors in the 1970s. Nor have you noted 
that, with no change in district lines, the balance of power was changed by the 
people in 1980 -- a year before the latest reapportionment. The 1981 
redistricting process, incidentally, was a minor movement of boundary lines to 
accommodate the change in population as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
When Turovsky refers to the current board's interest in self-preservation, he 
fails to note that Kenyon's proposal creates a plan in which all incumbents 
(Kenneth Hahn, Ed Edelman, Deane Dana and myself) remain as residents. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly enough, the judge retained a 3rd District for Edelman, who won 
his race in the same June primary that saw Sarah Flores emerge as the leader in 
the 1st District. But the judge created a new 1st District in which Molina is a 
resident and Flores' residence is excluded. 
</P>
<P>
He "generously" ruled that Flores may continue her candidacy as long as she is 
willing to sell her home and leave her community in the event of her election. 
</P>
<P>
The district lines that were drawn in 1981 did not discriminate against any 
group because of ethnicity, and all members of our board have so testified. 
</P>
<P>
Failure by the Board of Supervisors to appeal Kenyon's tyrannical rulings would 
be an arrogant disservice to all of the people of Los Angeles County.

FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE?;

<P>
QUESTIONS ABOUT MOSCOW'S MILITARY ADVISORY ROLE IN BAGHDAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moscow has joined with most of the rest of the world to condemn the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. But it seems fair to ask why among the 7,800 Soviet 
citizens still in Iraq there are about 200 military experts who continue to 
provide advice and services to dictator Saddam Hussein's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet spokesman excuses this with the remark that the experts are 
"fulfilling their contractual obligations." In other words, it's business as 
usual, even if that business means helping an outlaw state violate the rules of 
international behavior. At the same time, however, Soviet Prime Minister 
Nikolai Ryzhkov has ordered all other Soviet agencies to sever ties with Iraq 
to comply with U.N. resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow should rethink its notion that contracts associated with arms deals 
impose greater legal or moral obligations than do unanimous U.N. Security 
Council resolutions against an aggressor. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 
has expressed his revulsion at Iraq's recent behavior, including its holding of 
foreign hostages in Kuwait and Iraq. Gorbachev has specifically voiced regret 
that Iraq's army and air force carried out their aggression primarily using 
Soviet-supplied weapons and equipment. This principled position is at 
considerable variance with Moscow's apparent determination not to interrupt its 
military advisory role in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The most generous explanation for all this may be that the Soviets don't want 
to rile Hussein while a lot of Soviet citizens remain under his control. The 
evacuation of those citizens is supposed to begin this weekend. After that, 
perhaps, the Soviets may try to bring their advisers home. 
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, how much help are all those experts giving to Iraq's military? 
It's not being alarmist to note that at some point, maybe soon, this military 
could come into conflict with American and other forces sent to the area to 
repel aggression. U.S.-Soviet relations would surely be set back if fighting 
came, and "contractual obligations" found Soviet advisers on the wrong side.

A STITCH IN TIME REALLY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the best of times, stricter enforcement of sweatshop abuses would be the 
best way to deal with a growing problem. But more enforcement costs money, and 
the state has a budget crisis, so Gov. George Deukmejian should at least sign 
the measure on his desk. It would toughen the liability of garment 
manufacturers for abuses committed by their subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), comes in 
response to recent revelations of widespread labor violations in sweatshops, 
which once were concentrated in downtown Los Angeles and now are moving into 
Orange County and other suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
It would add responsibility to an industry that has a reputation for blatantly 
exploiting workers. As a recent Times series pointed out, thousands of 
seamstresses work for a pittance to support California's $6-billion garment 
industry. Most are immigrant Latinas or Asians who are too naive or frightened 
to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers invite abuses by hiring subcontractors at rates that can't 
possibly cover minimum wages. Also, the industry is riddled with 
"stitch-and-ditch" subcontractors who are undercapitalized, or simply 
unethical, and who disappear without paying owed wages. 
</P>
<P>
Despite awareness of the abuses, garment industry representatives strongly 
object to Hayden's bill, saying it's nearly impossible to keep an eye on 
subcontractors, and that the cost of doing so would force many manufacturers 
into bankruptcy. Instead, they urge stricter government enforcement of current 
laws. But state enforcement, already on the decline, is likely to erode further 
under this year's budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Current state law provides for some joint liability, but only if the 
subcontractor is not registered with the state. Hayden's bill, AB 3930, would 
put manufacturers on notice that they must carefully screen all those with whom 
they contract. That won't erase the problem, but it will inject some measure of 
accountability into the process.

Perhaps Annie should have waited for that special commitment -- marriage. The 
license to have children.

Perhaps, Chantal should have had her tubes tied if she didn't want to have any 
more children. They both might not be faced with that terrible decision to kill 
their child. Would they take a pill to kill themselves? No, but they can give 
themselves a pill to kill their child! Yes, you see, life does begin at 
conception because there is a beginning and there is an end to everything -- 
it's not nine months later, but nine months earlier. Why have nine Supreme 
Court justices given this country such mixed messages about life? Go ahead and 
get pregnant. You can kill your child! What are we teaching our children? What 
respect do we have for life? Yes, RU-486 will make it even a more disposable 
world.

Do you really believe a mother or a father has the right to choose to take the

</P>
<P>
Swanson, a native of Edgar, Neb., died Monday after a long illness, said Betty

</P>
<P>
Swanson attended the University of Nebraska, where he graduated with a bachelor

BENJAMIN BRENNER; RETIRED REAL ESTATE BROKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benjamin Brenner of Reseda, a retired real estate broker, has died in Woodland 
Hills. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Samarkand, Russia, Brenner died Friday of pneumonia, said Mae Brenner, 
his wife of 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
Brenner came to the United States with his family in 1913 and settled in 
Detroit. He and his two brothers owned three markets, Brenner Brothers Markets, 
from the early 1930s until 1946, when he moved to Los Angeles with his young 
family. He opened two markets, Foodlane Market in Culver City and Sunnyside 
Market in West Los Angeles, which he sold in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
He began investing in real estate in the late 1950s and in 1965 became a 
licensed real estate broker with Staples Real Estate in Culver City. Brenner 
worked with various real estate companies in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Reseda in 1976 and continued working with a number of real estate 
firms in the San Fernando Valley, retiring in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife; daughters Lori Keir of Culver City and Judy Kutthai 
of Agoura Hills; a brother, Nathan Brenner of Huntington Beach; sisters Ann 
Weisman of Royal Oak, Mich. and Mary Beiman of West Bloomfield, Mich.; and four 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A service was held Monday at Hillside Cemetery in Culver City. Arrangements 
were made by Glasband Willen Jewish Mortuary in Los Angeles. Donations can be 
made in Brenner's name to any charity.

FIGHT IRAQ BY SEA AND AIR, NOT BY LAND; 
</P>
<P>
KEEPING OUR GROUND TROOPS OUT WILL ENHANCE OUR STAYING POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.G.B. METCALF, A.G.B. Metcalf is chairman of the U.S. Strategic Institute, 
a private think tank, and military editor of Strategic Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddam Hussein has threatened to use foreign civilian hostages as a human 
shield to deter attack on his military forces and installations. With U.S. 
military personnel now heavily committed and exposed to dangers enormously 
greater, both in numbers and kind, the safety of civilian hostages cannot be 
permitted to drive U.S. military policy. To do so would be nothing less than to 
treat our soldiers as second-class citizens. 
</P>
<P>
How war is waged depends on the purpose for which the war is fought -- the 
objective -- and the nature of the theater of warfare -- the terrain, climate, 
and so on, and the forces and weapons used or expected to be used by the enemy. 
Thus, there are primarily naval wars, or land wars; if prevailing over the 
enemy, and not annexation and control of territory, is the casus belli, there 
can be air wars -- and there can be naval-air and land-air wars. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East conflict in which we find ourselves is, or should be, classed 
as a naval-air war. And that is how we should wage it. 
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances, the four U.S. Navy carrier task forces, with their 
complements of aircraft and attendant warships, are sufficient to achieve the 
objectives of the blockade against Iraq. Those forces alone also are capable of 
providing full defensive support for Saudi Arabia if augmented by strategic air 
power -- FB-111s, B-52s and B-1Bs -- from remote bases, perhaps in Greece or 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis' three AWACS systems, plus the two provided by the United States, 
should be sufficient to provide military intelligence and surveillance, 
augmented as they are by our own satellite surveillance capability. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi land forces, were they to invade Saudi Arabia, could be attacked and 
repelled in the open desert terrain by carrier-based aircraft, backed by 
strategic bomber forces from remote U.S. bases. Also, there is the option of 
applying remotely based air power to devastate the enemy's war-supporting 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
The injection of F-15s and ground forces -- Army and Marine Corps -- was 
certainly premature and may have been unnecessary and unwise. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of U.S. F-15s in Saudi Arabia, in addition to the 60 F-15s 
operated by the Saudis, introduced the need for air bases and airfields, which 
must be defended by ground forces. These further necessitate ground-force bases 
that must be defended and supplied. 
</P>
<P>
In a military operation where the modification of enemy behavior is the 
objective, and where naval blockade of the enemy economy is the instrument, 
time must be allowed to achieve the desired result. 
</P>
<P>
The injection of additional forces in Saudi Arabia with the intent to 
strengthen a military presence can be a two-edged sword. Their vulnerability 
may render them a potential element of weakness and, at best, a distraction 
from the major purpose: naval blockade, with its economic constraints, extended 
over a protracted period of time. 
</P>
<P>
If our total involved military personnel were based on the carrier task forces 
or at remote bases, we could reduce -- if not eliminate -- their vulnerability 
to attack. We also would relieve them of host-country problems raised by the 
billeting of large numbers of military personnel in a climate where custom 
resists such a presence. In this context, our naval carrier task forces provide 
bases that are virtually autonomous insofar as logistical support -- food, 
medical service and water -- are concerned. Our forces thus could avoid living 
under conditions strange to them and for which their training has been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
In summary, our strategic posture in this conflict should be reexamined. 
</P>
<P>
Awesome military power can still be brought to bear in defense of Saudi Arabia. 
It is a region made to order for naval-air action and naval blockade, without a 
single U.S. soldier having to set foot on Middle East territory. Such a course 
of action would avoid the casualties to be expected in a land war. More 
important, it is designed to maximize staying power -- at home and abroad -- in 
a protracted conflict, a consideration that could determine the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
It is realized that these recommendations present a picture sharply at variance 
with the situation as it now exists. The purpose of this analysis is not to 
criticize action already taken; it is to offer constructively a line of 
reasoning for circumstances in which we must be sure of our course of action 
and of our staying ability. 
</P>
<P>
It is never too late to review one's posture in a critical military situation. 
Indeed, failure to do so solely because of the extent of our initial 
ground-force commitment in Saudi Arabia -- however that came about -- would not 
commend us favorably to the fortunes of war.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who had been wanted for 53 outstanding misdemeanor counts was sentenced 
to three years' probation and 350 days in jail after pleading guilty Wednesday 
to 25 counts in Municipal Court, a court spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Anthony Simpson, 23, who police say is a transient, pleaded guilty 
Tuesday to an array of misdemeanors that included illegal lodging, littering 
the sidewalk, jaywalking, possession of narcotics paraphernalia and drinking 
alcohol in a restricted area, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police officers caught up with Simpson on Monday and were planning to 
issue him a routine misdemeanor citation on suspicion of breaking into a change 
box at a downtown parking lot. After running a records check, police discovered 
a backlog of warrants for Simpson's arrest because of his failure to appear in 
court on other misdemeanor citations. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson pleaded guilty to fewer than half the outstanding misdemeanor cases 
against him because of a deal worked out with the city attorney's office, said 
Laurent J. Comeau, the county public defender assigned to the case.

KIDS NEED SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Janella Belyeu of South Los Angeles has an 11-year-old son who will be 
attending year-round public school beginning next summer. She told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't think it's a good idea to require students to attend public school in 
the summer. We like to take vacations in the summer and we won't able to take 
trips if my son has to attend school year round. 
</P>
<P>
The time off gives students a chance to rest and come back to school fresh and 
ready to learn. 
</P>
<P>
This change will also be costly for some because many parents have depended on 
their older children to baby-sit the younger children in the household in the 
summer months. 
</P>
<P>
The school board says they need year-round school because they're in a 
financial pinch. But the district is top-heavy. Why haven't they considered 
cutting the pay (of administrators)? 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if the school board has considered the conditions of the classrooms in 
the summer. It's very hot and some students have difficulty concentrating in 
the heat. On the other hand, summer trips can be very educational. Last summer, 
we went to Washington, D.C., which was very educational experience for my son.

Legislation to keep violent offenders in prison longer by denying them 
sentence-shortening credits for work and good behavior has passed the Assembly 
Committee on Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-1 vote sent the bill (SB 1720), sponsored by Sen. Robert Presley

</P>
<P>
"The problem presented by early release of serious repeat violent offenders is 
that there are almost always immediate new victims," said Presley, a former 
sheriff's deputy. "This bill will help keep this type of offender in prison for 
their full sentences." 
</P>

BASEBALL: ANGEL STARTER LASTS ONLY 5 1/3 INNINGS, GIVING UP SIX EARNED RUNS IN 
7-4 LOSS TO TIGERS.

<P>
His complexion matched the ashen clouds over Tiger Stadium, but Chuck Finley 
insisted he wasn't under the weather when he took the mound Wednesday. "I felt 
fine," he said. "The game made me sick. The whole outing made me sick. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was punching tickets at a movie theater. Take a ticket and come 
on in. Take a ticket and come on in. Every time I looked up, there were men on 
base. The worst part was, I look up at the scoreboard and there are no outs. To 
see that many guys on base and no outs, that'll make you sick. Then I look in 
the dugout and see everybody kind of looking toward the bullpen . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Finley didn't complete that sentence -- or his mission against the Tigers. In a 
rare rocky performance, the Angel left-hander was thumped for nine hits and six 
earned runs in 5 1/3 innings of a 7-4 loss to Detroit, his shortest stint in 10 
starts since a 4 1/3-inning effort against the Chicago White Sox on June 27. 
Finley (16-6) failed to get into the seventh inning for only the fourth time in 
25 starts this season and walked the first two batters in an inning for the 
first time since May 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even realize that. That's something else to worry about now," said 
Finley, whose earned-run average rose to 2.47 but is still second-lowest in the 
American League. "With practice, I can get pretty good at walking people. 
That's just the way the whole day went." 
</P>
<P>
The game went back and forth in the early innings, despite Travis Fryman's 
first-inning home run off Finley and the inning-opening walks to Tony Phillips 
and Fryman in the third that turned into runs when Cecil Fielder doubled home 
Phillips -- Fielder's 100th RBI of the season -- and Gary Ward drove in Fryman 
with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels came back to take a 4-3 lead against Jack Morris (10-11) on one run 
in the fourth and three in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder doubled and scored on Dick Schofield's single to cut Detroit's 
lead to 3-2 in the fifth. Then Schofield, who had taken second on the throw 
home, scored on Luis Polonia's double down the right-field line, and Polonia 
scored on Devon White's single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
That lead vanished in the bottom of the inning when Fryman singled, went to 
second as Alan Trammell beat out a chopper to third and scored on Fielder's 
single into left field. 
</P>
<P>
"Morris has been better. He didn't have very good stuff, but unfortunately for 
us, neither did Chuck," said Brian Downing, whose fourth-inning single scored 
White with the Angels' first run. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, when we get a lead like that and come back from a deficit, Chuck 
holds them back. It was obvious from the start that he was having problems 
today. It happens. He deserves an off-day once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Finley got Darnell Coles to ground out for the first out of the sixth inning, 
but walked Mike Heath on a 3-and-2 pitch, gave up a single to Phillips and 
walked Fryman to load the bases. This time, when Manager Doug Rader looked to 
the bullpen, he called in Mark Eichhorn. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw pretty good in the pen (before the game), but once I got in there, I 
was struggling and I said to myself, 'I'm struggling way too early,' " said 
Finley, who shut out the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park in his last outing 
Friday and hadn't allowed more than four earned runs in his previous 14 starts. 
"I was just trying to get some innings in, so maybe I could find a groove. I 
just wasn't moving the ball around the plate very well." 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn didn't have much more luck in the sixth. Trammell, the first batter to 
face the Angel reliever, hit a slow roller that was thrown away by Donnie Hill, 
his first error at second base this season. Heath and Phillips scored, and 
Fryman went to third. Fielder scored Fryman with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could get (Trammell) if I quick-flipped it," Hill said. "If I had 
gone back and thrown like I should have, I might have gotten him. I made a 
terrible throw." 
</P>
<P>
Which was in keeping with Finley's day. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have four, five great starts and then two or three bad. You throw a 
shutout and go out and get knocked around," said Finley, who still leads AL 
left-handers in victories. "It's a humbling game. You think you're going a bit 
better than the game is and it sets you straight." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure made his third relief appearance since coming off the Angels' 
disabled list and has yet to allow a run in two innings. The only batter he 
faced Wednesday, Larry Sheets, grounded into a double play in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Coachman's first-inning double gave him at least one hit in each of the 
five games he has played since being recalled from triple-A Edmonton. Overall, 
he's nine for 21, a .429 average. . . . "The more I play, the more I feel good 
at the plate," he said. "I realize I'm at a higher level, and they're going to 
make good plays on me. What would be a hit in triple A is taken away from you 
in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia, whose third-inning walk Tuesday was his first in the last 108 
plate appearances, has promised hitting instructor Deron Johnson that he will 
get at least 15 more walks this season. "I know I can do it," said Polonia, who 
has walked 14 times in 85 games. "I've got to make the pitcher work. I'll get 
better pitches, too." . . . Dave Winfield had a swollen left ankle after 
fouling a ball Tuesday and didn't play Wednesday. However, he doesn't always 
play a day game that follows a night game. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White has stolen a base in the last four games he has reached base. . . . 
Catcher Bill Schroeder, who gave Lance Parrish a rest after Tuesday night's 
game, extended his hitting streak to six games. The streak began July 29. "I 
had a 10-game streak once in Milwaukee that went from early June to late July," 
Schroeder said. "You've got to like doing this (playing part time). A lot of 
people wouldn't be happy in this position, but I like it." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield, who has raised his batting average 52 points to .228, credits 
some of his success to using a bigger and heavier bat. He had been using 
34-inch bats that weighed 31 or 32 ounces but has switched to a 36-inch bat 
that weighs 35 ounces.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was one of those 35,000 or so people who left Dodger Stadium early Tuesday 
night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was the top of the sixth inning. The Dodgers had just scored eight runs and 
were leading the Fightin' Phils, 11-1. Two hours of baseball was enough. 
Besides, I could still get home in time to see the rerun of a "thirtysomething" 
that I had missed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Normally, I stay up for the late edition of "Sports Center," on ESPN, but this 
was a slow news day and I already knew that the Reds had won, meaning their 
lead over the Dodgers would remain at 5 1/2 games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
On the way to work Wednesday morning, I was planning my next column. A preview 
of the Dodger-Met series. The hot Dodgers and the frigid Mets. What a 
turnaround the Dodger bullpen was making. Leads were safer now. And maybe I 
would tweak Tom Lasorda for not starting the phenom, Jose Offerman, at 
shortstop Tuesday after his batting average had dipped to .444. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I reached my desk and saw this message on my computer terminal from Times 
columnist Mike Downey: "It ain't over till it's OVER." It was filed at 12:31 
Wednesday morning. I had sat behind Downey in the press box for five innings at 
Dodger Stadium, but what was he trying to tell me? . . . 
</P>
<P>
I picked up the newspaper. A final from Chavez Ravine: Philadelphia 12, Los 
Angeles 11. Jose Offerman, substituting for Alfredo Griffin, had made two 
errors in the Phillies' nine-run ninth inning. The Dodgers were 6 1/2 back. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda said he was shocked. So was I. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're the Dodgers, do you sign Darryl Strawberry even if it costs you in 
the neighborhood of $5 million a year? Yes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Like the smartest NFL teams in the draft, you go after the best athlete 
available. That's Strawberry, who told the Mets in a clubhouse meeting Friday 
that he probably won't be around next season after becoming a free agent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A logjam in the outfield? Don't worry about it. If anything, that's a plus that 
gives you trading leverage. The important thing is to sign Strawberry, one of 
the few players in baseball who can carry a team for an extended period. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The return of Orel Hershiser and the addition of Strawberry would make the 
Dodgers solid favorites to win the National League West next season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I never did like the strategy of pitching to a No. 8 hitter with the pitcher on 
deck, a runner in scoring position and two outs. It backfired on Tom Lasorda in 
the second inning Tuesday night when Dickie Thon singled home Tommy Herr from 
third base. Of course, who knew that the run would make a difference? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It looks as though Wade Boggs is going to reach 200 hits again, after all. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bret Johnson, who has left UCLA after starting for the Bruins last 
season, was rated a better college prospect than former Orange County high 
school rival Todd Marinovich by many scouts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look for Larry Burnett and Alan Massengale of ESPN fame to be on Prime Ticket's 
sports news show when it makes its debut in October. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Trainer is talking to promoters in Japan, Italy and France about a Sugar 
Ray Leonard fight in December. The opponents being mentioned are not household 
names -- Carlos Elliott, Dario Matteoni and Gianfranco Rossi. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo, Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman and defending champion Curtis Strange 
will make up the field for the Skins Game Nov. 24-25 at PGA West in LaQuinta. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reuss recently pitched 24 consecutive scoreless innings for Buffalo and 
probably will be called by Pittsburgh next month when the rosters are expanded. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Opperman and Offerman? Dan Opperman, the former first-round draft choice who 
missed the 1987 and '88 seasons after undergoing elbow surgery twice, was named 
the Dodgers' minor league pitcher of the week after improving his record at San 
Antonio to 10-8. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Boston, the former long jump record-holder and 1960 Olympic Games gold 
medalist, is co-owner of the CBS television affiliate in Knoxville, Tenn., and 
is in town for the Tennessee-Colorado game Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
They take their college football seriously in Tennessee. Thirty-six reporters 
are traveling west to cover the Vols. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fontana High School, which went 14-0 and won the Southern Section Division I 
football championship last year, is supposed to be even better this season. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't bother me if Robert Nederlander also replaced George Steinbrenner 
on the U.S. Olympic Committee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Clipper center Benoit Benjamin attended Pete Newell's big-man camp last week. 
"It's the hardest I've ever seen Benoit work," said General Manager Elgin 
Baylor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among those participating at the Newell camp is a seven-footer from Japan. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Next time the Dodgers take an 11-1 lead, I'll stay at least until the seventh 
inning.

PAT VALENZUELA PICKS UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF WITH A VICTORY ON BEST PAL IN BALBOA 
STAKES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela picked up where he left off Wednesday. In his first day back 
since becoming ill early Saturday, Del Mar's leading rider won the $80,325 
Balboa Stakes aboard Best Pal. 
</P>
<P>
How he felt about the 2-year-old gelding's performance in the prep for the Del 
Mar Futurity or the developments of the past several days were thoughts he kept 
to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Approached by a group of reporters after Best Pal's two-length victory over 
Xray, Valenzuela waved them off, saying he didn't want to talk. When asked if 
there was a specific reason, he silently stood up and made his way to the 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to ride Sunny Blossom in a Pimlico stakes Saturday, the 27-year-old 
jockey called in sick from his hotel. In light of Valenzuela's past -- he 
tested positive for cocaine last fall and was suspended for 60 days -- there 
was immediate suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was taken off his mounts at Del Mar Sunday and Monday, then was 
cleared to ride locally after meeting with stewards David Samuel, Hubert Jones 
and Mort Lipton Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in at 9:45," Samuel said. "He told us he took a flight (to Maryland) 
Friday night and when he got there early Saturday morning, he felt a little 
woozy. When he got to his hotel, he took a nap. When he woke up around noon, he 
called Pimlico and told them to take him off all his mounts except Sunny 
Blossom. At about 2 o'clock, he realized he was too sick to ride and called the 
stewards and told them he wouldn't be able to ride in the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he tried and was unsuccessful in getting a doctor to come to his room. 
He said he was too sick to fly out Saturday night, so he waited and came back 
to California Sunday evening." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by agent Bob Meldahl, Valenzuela went to see Dr. Neil Fisher in 
Covina Tuesday. Fisher, who talked with the stewards Wednesday morning, said 
Valenzuela was sick from some sort of a virus or possibly had a case of food 
poisoning. According to Samuel, Valenzuela said one of his daughters had 
similar symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to take a drug test, Valenzuela did so without objection. "There was no 
problem at all," Samuel said. "He seemed like he was in a good mood when we 
talked to him." 
</P>
<P>
Looking more and more like the one to beat in the Del Mar Futurity, Best Pal 
took full advantage of a perfect trip in the Balboa for his second stakes 
victory of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Not tested by a weak field in the I'm Smokin Stakes July 27, the 
California-bred son of Habitony sat a couple of lengths off even-money favorite 
Iroquois Park and Gold Crest Express while they battled through the first 
half-mile, then took command into the stretch for his third win in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised we weren't favored today," trainer Ian Jory said after Best 
Pal paid $5.20 to win. "I don't want to sound cocky, but I thought we would be. 
We always knew he was a nice horse, so we've been confident all along. I've 
trained him pretty easy. He's a pretty sensible kind of horse and doesn't need 
a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident for the Futurity (on Sept. 12 at a mile). Distance is no 
object. He beat a handy field today and will appreciate the extra furlong. Two 
turns should be no problem. I didn't tell Patrick anything. He knows the horse 
and works him all the time. I'll probably just jog him up to the Futurity and 
work him once." 
</P>
<P>
Successful in the De Anza Stakes two weeks earlier, Iroquois Park faded to 
fourth after his early efforts, beaten more than nine lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't relax," Gary Stevens said. "He just didn't settle at all. When we 
hit the three-eighths pole, I felt like he was relaxed then, but I knew he was 
done. He got really tired. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a better colt than what he showed today. I'd throw the race out. It's a 
possibility he might have bled because he was really blowing after the race." 
</P>
<P>
Xray, a son of Allen's Prospect who had finished third in the De Anza, looked 
as though he might give Best Pal a battle through the stretch but proved no 
match. This, despite the fact he was able to slip through along the rail while 
the winner swung wide. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to gallop," said Eddie Delahoussaye, who took over from 
Valenzuela on the 7-1 fourth choice. "I thought I had a lot more horse than 
what I did. But Pat's horse just really accelerated." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The hearing for trainer Ron McAnally's appeal on the disqualification of Tight 
Spot in Sunday's Del Mar Derby is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Sept. 5. . . . 
Through the first four weeks of Del Mar's meeting, the average on-track 
attendance is 17,062, up 2.3% percent from 1989, and the combined, on and 
off-track attendance is 35,488, up 2.7%. . . . Jockey Robbie Davis became a 
father for the fourth time when wife Marguerite gave birth to six-pound 
five-ounce Daniel Edmund Tuesday.

HEAT EDGE SANTA BARBARA, MEET CALIFORNIA FOR DIVISION TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Heat play the California Emperors, the hottest team in the 
league, at the University of Redlands on Saturday at 3 p.m. to decide the 
Southern Division championship of the American Professional Soccer League West. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat, the best road team in the division, opened playoff action with a 1-0 
loss to Real Santa Barbara on Saturday, but won the right to meet California by 
defeating host Santa Barbara on Monday, 2-1, in a regulation game and 1-0 in 
the 30-minute mini-game that followed. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat is 7-4 on the road. The Emperors lost both games to the Heat in 
overtime this season, but have won seven consecutive games. California's last 
loss came to the Heat on penalty kicks July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The winner plays the Northern Division champion (Salt Lake City, Colorado or 
San Francisco) in a home-and-home series Sept. 7-9 and 14-16. 
</P>
<P>
Heat defender Danny Pena, who received his fifth yellow card Monday, will not 
be allowed to play Saturday. Midfielder Mike Getchell might also be prohibited 
from playing. Getchell also received his fifth yellow card, but the Heat has 
filed a protest with the league asking that it be rescinded.

Phil Mickelson of San Diego set a U.S. Amateur qualifying record with an 
eight-under-par 64 Wednesday to comfortably win medalist honors as the 
tournament headed into its match-play segment. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson, a junior at Arizona State, birdied eight holes at Meridian Golf Club 
for a 36-hole qualifying total of 135. 
</P>
<P>
He had an even-par 71 on Tuesday at Cherry Hills Country Club despite a 
quadruple-bogey seven on the par-three 15th hole, where he left his second shot 
in the sand and four-putted. 
</P>
<P>
At 137, two strokes back, stood Richard Holland, a mortgage loan officer from 
Washington, D.C., who celebrated his 30th birthday with a 67 at Meridian. Perry 
Moss, a senior-to-be at LSU, was at 138. Moss, from Shreveport, La., had two 
69s. 
</P>
<P>
Former PGA Tour player David Eger, who was reinstated as an amateur in 1986, 
had a 68 for a 140 total. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time amateur champion Jay Sigel was in a group at 141 after a 69, and 
defending champion Chris Patton shot 72 for a 143 total, along with first-round 
qualifying leader Chip Stewart, who slipped to a 75 after an opening 68. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four players advance to today's opening round of match play at Cherry 
Hills.

UPKEEP AT KNOLLWOOD VEERING OFF COURSE

<TEXT>
<P>
The good news these days from the Knollwood Country Club in Granada Hills -- 
the most heavily played public course in the Valley -- is that not all of the 
fairway grass is dead and not all of the greens have turned brown. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news, however, is that most of the areas of the course that are not 
parched are soggy and swampy. 
</P>
<P>
Once a splendid golf course, Knollwood has deteriorated badly in the past 
several months. How bad is it? Well, let some of the golfers describe it. 
</P>
<P>
"The condition of the course has approached the level of a cattle enclosure," 
said veteran golfer Eugene McCarthy of Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
And from Don Axelson, also a longtime player at the course and the president of 
the Knollwood Men's Golf Club: "Basically, they have allowed Knollwood to go to 
hell. It is simply a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
And this from Larry Lee: "Knollwood is not in the best of conditions at the 
moment. It has been a few months since I played there, and it was acceptable 
then. But the problems have worsened since then." 
</P>
<P>
If it seems that Lee was a bit more tactful in his criticism than McCarthy and 
Axelson, well, there's a reason. Lee is golf director for the Los Angeles 
County Parks &amp; Recreation Department, where his job is to make sure the 
county's courses are properly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The county last year considered turning over maintenance of Knollwood to a 
private golf course management firm, but the plan fizzled when the Parks &amp; 
Recreation Department received no bids that it considered adequate. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing months, very few things have not gone wrong at the course. On 
the first hole there is an area of standing water and mud extending nearly 75 
yards from the green. It is impassable with a golf cart and nearly impassable 
without one. The best way to play the hole is while wearing your 
brother-in-law's golf shoes. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, who has played at Knollwood for 17 years, said a snorkel would be 
nice, too. 
</P>
<P>
"At least five holes have had leaks in the sprinkler systems for so long that 
actual swamps have formed on the fairways," he said. "I mean standing, filthy 
water. No one knows how deep it might be because no one has been brave enough 
to find out." 
</P>
<P>
And several of the tees similarly have been, let's say, overwatered. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks ago I played there and one tee was so wet, the ground so thoroughly 
soaked, that when you put a tee in the ground it could not support the weight 
of a golf ball," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything at Knollwood is soaked. Some areas appear to have last seen 
water about the time that the niblick was a popular club. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens are either dead or dying," said Axelson. "We don't even call them 
greens anymore. We call them browns." 
</P>
<P>
And if the alternating swamp-and-desert setting isn't enough to make the 
golfers angry, the holes are. The holes were dug by a construction company 
installing an irrigation-control system during the past several months. The 
holes are deep and they are wide. And several of them, flush in the middle of 
fairways, have yet to be filled in. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 4 fairway has six excavations in a row," McCarthy said. "Like someone 
dropped bombs." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the problems have been related to ongoing construction. 
</P>
<P>
"The installation of the new irrigation control system, a computerized system 
which tells the sprinklers when to come on and how long to stay on for, was a 
major project," Lee said. "It caused some disruptions. And while converting the 
course from the old watering system to the new one, we have lost some control 
over the watering process, which has given us inconsistent watering. There are 
wet areas and there are dry areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of the problems and we are addressing them. I have told people at 
Knollwood that the greens, which were subject to heavy fungus infestations this 
summer, will be back to normal in November and that all the other problems will 
be corrected before that." 
</P>
<P>
Going places: Angie Ravaioli of Moorpark remembers the day that she realized 
she might have a future in golf. It was the day that recruiters from Southern 
Methodist University came calling. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was still in high school and someone was offering to pay for my college 
education if I would play golf for them, I knew I might be better than an 
average golfer," said Ravaioli, who went on to play at SMU for four years. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year she has played on the new women's Players' West Tour in 
California, Nevada and Arizona. And next week, Ravaioli, 23, leaves for Venice, 
Fla., for the first stage of the LPGA Qualifying School and a chance at a 
playing card for that lucrative tour for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what the odds are," she said. "I know how many people are competing for 
just a few spots. But ever since I started playing golf, I've always been able 
to compete against the players at each level. From junior golf to high school 
golf, then to college golf and now on this pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can compete on the LPGA Tour, too." 
</P>
<P>
Ravaioli has not exactly dominated play on the Players West Tour. In 16 events 
this year she has won just $2,744 and ranks 22nd on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played well," she said. "In several tournaments I had a good chance to 
win but then turned in one bad round out of the four that dropped me back. Golf 
is, I think, all mental and I've had a hard time keeping my concentration for a 
whole tournament. But I'm working on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always dreamed of playing on the LPGA Tour. I think I have a chance."

CHARGERS THINK THEY HAVE SOMEONE SPECIAL IN PASQUALE 
</P>

<P>
Grabbing the catsup bottle with one hand and the pepper shaker with the other, 
Larry Pasquale begins to describe the punt return. Pepper is the short man, 
catsup the deep man. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes light up like those of someone about to slap down a royal flush. He 
gets a charge out of this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale is the Chargers' new special teams coach. He came west this year, 
after 10 seasons with the New York Jets, to fix what was nothing short of an 
abomination last season. He knows how a special teams unit can win a football 
game. Or lose one. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of his favorite examples: 
</P>
<P>
It was a Monday night game between the Jets and New Orleans back in the early 
1980s. There were less than two minutes to play, and the Saints were ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard Cosell basically had shut off his mind," Pasquale recalls. "He had 
assumed the Saints were going to win. They were talking about nothing at the 
end of the game. They were basically just rambling." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Jets returned a punt 76 yards for a touchdown, and Howard tuned 
back in and said in his unmistakeable voice: "What a football game this turned 
out to be." 
</P>
<P>
You can hear it, can't you? 
</P>
<P>
"They might have been packing up or something, saying 'What time is that 
plane?' " Pasquale says, demonstrating how the camera had focused on the pepper 
shaker when it should have been following the catsup bottle. "I thought it was 
really hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
Hysterical. What a perfect word to describe the Chargers' special teams last 
season, unless, of course, you are one of the coaches. It was better than 
vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, we saw Hank Ilesic shank two punts that went less than 10 yards 
each. There was the 17-16 loss to Seattle in Week 6 when the potential tying 
extra point and a subsequent field-goal attempt were both blocked. There were 
the times the football bounced off players' helmets and through their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
It was all great stuff for the blooper file. But it naturally didn't sit well 
with Charger Coach Dan Henning, who fired Joe Madden as special teams coach at 
the end of the season. Madden was the defensive coordinator on the Pittsburgh 
Steelers' 1976 Super Bowl team, but Charger players lost confidence in him. 
</P>
<P>
"People just didn't feel like it was important," says inside linebacker Gary 
Plummer. "Most of the guys that are in the NFL have been stars all their lives. 
When all of a sudden they're relegated to special teams, they feel like 
second-class citizens. And that's the way the guys played last year. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a motivating guy like Pasquale, you feel important." 
</P>
<P>
That's where Madden fell short. Players didn't take him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the change was necessary because some people in our organization 
(thought) we needed a change, and that carried over to the players," Henning 
said. "And I thought Joe was a little undermined. He was fighting an uphill 
battle. We needed a fresh approach and a fresh start." 
</P>
<P>
In defense of Madden, Henning says the personnel wasn't conducive to a polished 
product. The Chargers filled in a lot of gaps with backup players who had 
little or no experience in that area. 
</P>
<P>
When the special teams look like a circus act, the coach gets blamed. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's not the way you should completely evaluate the coach's ability," 
Henning says. "That would mean that Chuck Noll wasn't a very good coach for 
three or four years, but he was a great coach in the '70s. He's an outstanding 
coach, and when he had outstanding players, they were outstandingly productive. 
When he didn't have outstanding players, he wasn't as good a coach. So that's a 
crock." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Henning knew whom he wanted as Madden's replacement. Back in high 
school in New York, Henning and Pasquale used to play football at rival schools 
in Brooklyn. Henning was the quarterback for St. Francis High, a Catholic 
powerhouse, and Pasquale was the quarterback at Lafayette, a public school with 
an equally successful program. 
</P>
<P>
Henning tried to get Pasquale to coach his special teams in Atlanta in 1983 
when he was coach of the Falcons. Pasquale declined, deciding he didn't want to 
desert Jet Coach Joe Walton. 
</P>
<P>
Henning called again after last season, and he and Pasquale met in New York. 
Three or four hours of discussion were enough to determine that they were on 
the same wavelength. Henning wanted to have every coach and every player on the 
team involved in special teams. Pasquale decided it was worth leaving New York 
for a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity to maximize our coaches' contributions and players' 
contributions," Pasquale says. "I really wanted to be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
This year, everybody participates in special teams drills. Pasquale spends 
hours with his assistant, LeCharls McDaniel, evaluating personnel and figuring 
ways to make sure players are in sync. 
</P>
<P>
Playing special teams is kind of a strange deal. It's all about throwing 
linebackers, receivers, running backs and whoever else together on one unit and 
expecting them to click. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very tricky," Pasquale says. "You have to develop a bond. They have to 
have a trust in one another and a feeling for one another. It takes a great 
deal of understanding of the personalities of the people." 
</P>
<P>
So far so good. Wide receiver Nate Lewis went 87 yards on a kickoff return last 
Saturday to help the Chargers to a 30-27 victory over the Rams. Exhibition or 
not, that buoyed Pasquale. 
</P>
<P>
And the players are taking pride in playing on special teams. Guys such as 
Donald Frank, a rookie cornerback from Winston Salem State, and Lewis, a rookie 
from Oregon Tech. Both are Pasquale's type: speedy and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
In past seasons, the special teams players would stay late after practice while 
the others headed for dinner. That didn't sit too well. 
</P>
<P>
"You felt like it was a punishment," Plummer said. "With Larry, everyone's out 
there. Everyone's involved." 
</P>
<P>
Which doesn't mean that everything is perfect. Against the Rams, the Chargers 
missed a 27-yard field goal and a PAT. And they narrowly escaped a blocked 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
If there is still room for improvement, there is one thing that is certain. 
There is enthusiasm. Special teams aren't a chore. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt that (last year) they didn't really believe they could make a 
difference," Pasquale says. "It didn't seem like they were really into it, like 
they felt they could defeat their opponents on a regular basis. Our biggest job 
was really to regain their confidence in special teams." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning said defensive tackle Les Miller, who strained his 
elbow in the Rams' game, will miss Saturday's game against the 49ers. Also out 
is tight end Arthur Cox, who has missed 15 days with a back strain.

DIGEST: VOORHEES AND WHITNEY CUT FROM NFL SQUADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Valley-area football players were cut by National Football League teams 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Voorhees, an offensive guard from Cal State Northridge, was cut by the 
New York Giants, and Ken Whitney, an offensive lineman from Cal Lutheran, was 
dropped by New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees (6-foot-5, 302 pounds) was an eighth-round pick of the Giants in the 
1990 draft. Whitney (6-3, 300) had signed a free-agent contract with the Saints 
after rejecting offers from the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football 
League. The Lions selected him in the second round of the CFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney saw his only NFL action in the Saints' 13-10 exhibition win over the 
Minnesota Vikings on Aug. 11. Despite his release, Whitney could be resuming 
his professional football career shortly by joining British Columbia. He was 
born in Montreal and graduated from a Calgary high school. 
</P>
<P>
Teri Rupe, a former Cal Lutheran softball player and assistant coach, has been 
named to succeed Tony Venditto as the Regals' softball coach. Venditto resigned 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Rupe graduated from CLU in 1989 with a bachelor's degree in sociology and 
assisted Venditto last season. She transferred to CLU from Pierce College and 
posted a three-year batting average of .278. A three-time NAIA All-District 3 
selection, Rupe had 79 runs batted in, 21 doubles and only 10 errors in her CLU 
career. 
</P>
<P>
She is the fifth softball head coach in CLU history. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Choi, the City Section 3-A Division Player of the Year at Fairfax High, has 
signed a scholarship to play baseball for Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Choi, a 6-1, 175-pound right-hander, was 12-1-1 with a 1.30 earned-run average 
and helped lead the Lions to the City 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Choi is the sixth pitcher Northridge Coach Bill Kernen has signed this year, 
but the first from the high school ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching has definitely been my No. 1 priority," said Kernen, whose team was 
the runner-up in the NCAA Division II World Series this year. "It's not a 
coincidence that of the eight players we've signed this year, six have been 
pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Fluker, who played basketball at Cal State Northridge several seasons 
ago, has returned to his alma mater as a part-time assistant men's basketball 
coach, the school announced. 
</P>
<P>
Fluker, 31, replaces Dave Fehte, who was hired as a full-time assistant at St. 
Mary's College after six seasons at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate assistant at Northridge from 1986-88, Fluker averaged two points and 
2.5 rebounds a game during his senior season in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors finished 20-10 and won their last California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. title that season. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, a softball team based in Burbank, won the National Women's 
Fast-Pitch B tournament in Midland, Tex., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Leticia Carranza, who was chosen the tournament's most valuable player, 
the Mavericks won five consecutive games to win the three-day, 
double-elimination tournament. The Mavericks defeated The Travelers of Alta 
Loma, 4-2, in the title game at the Bill Hogan Sports Complex. 
</P>
<P>
Carranza, a former standout at North Hollywood High and Valley College, batted 
.445 with five doubles during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Other Mavericks selected to the all-tournament first team were pitcher Sue 
Oran; catcher Jamie Berkman; outfielder Tina Baca; and infielders Nicole 
Stelter and Lesley Plank.

COMPUTER FILE: YOU CAN LABEL STICKER-PRINTING SOFTWARE A CHAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
I like to put labels on things. I label my file folders, diskettes, videotapes, 
photo albums, home canning jars and boxes that I put in storage. I even put 
labels on people. I just finished making gummed name tags for my son's fourth 
birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
Making labels used to be easy. You wrote them by hand or inserted them into the 
typewriter. Using a computer to make a single label or address an envelope is 
usually more trouble than it's worth. Until recently, I kept a typewriter near 
my desk for envelopes and labels. But that old typewriter has been exiled to 
the closet now that I have a Smart Label Printer from Seiko Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The printer, which works with IBM-compatible PCs and the Apple Macintosh and 
comes with software, is designed especially to create and print one label at a 
time. You can also print several copies of a single label or use the mail list 
option to print multiple labels from a data file on your disk. 
</P>
<P>
The one-pound machine, which measures 3.6 by 6.3 inches, plugs into a PC 
communications port or to either the printer or modem port of a Mac. Because 
all Macs and most PCs are also equipped with printer ports, the device doesn't 
interfere with your regular printer. 
</P>
<P>
When you want to create a label, you simply load in the software and type in 
the text. The software works as a memory-resident program on the PC or as a 
desk accessory on the Mac. Thus, on either machine, it can pop up even while 
you're using another program. 
</P>
<P>
Once the program is on the screen, you can type several lines of text. You can 
also capture a name and address line (or any other text) directly from your 
word processing software or other program. So, if you have the name and address 
typed into your letter, you can easily transfer it to the Smart Label Printer's 
software. The software automatically searches through your document to locate 
what it considers a valid name and address. 
</P>
<P>
It is also able to print bar codes, such as those on most supermarket items. 
</P>
<P>
The program is promoted as a tool to create labels for envelopes, but I don't 
use it that way for fear that my friends and colleagues will think I'm sending 
them junk mail. I use the printer regularly, however, to create file folder 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
The machine comes with one roll of gummed, pressure-sensitive thermal labels. A 
pack of additional labels (two rolls, or 260 stickers) is $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
The unit has a suggested retail price of $249.95. It and additional labels can 
be ordered (at full retail price) from CP Plus Inc. at (800) 274-4277. Other 
dealers may offer it at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
Seiko Instruments can be reached at (800) 888-0817 or (408) 922-5900. Fax: 
(408) 922-5835. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you want to print more than one label at a time. Although it can be 
done with the little Seiko printer, it's a slow process and not at all 
cost-effective. Chances are that you already have a printer that can do the 
job. What you need are special printer labels and, possibly, some software to 
make the job easier. 
</P>
<P>
The type of label stock depends on whether you're using a laser printer or a 
regular "impact printer" such as a dot matrix or daisy wheel. If you're using a 
laser printer, you need label stock that comes on 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheets 
specially designed to run through the laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
It's tempting to buy less expensive labels designed for typewriters or copiers, 
but labels not designed specifically for laser printers can easily come loose 
and affix themselves inside the printer, necessitating a repair bill that 
dwarfs whatever you might have saved on the cost of the labels. 
</P>
<P>
Avery makes label stock for laser and dot matrix printers in various sizes and 
styles. In addition to the regular mailing labels, it also makes diskette 
labels and specialized labels for file folders, tags and videocassettes, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
You can print labels using just about any database or word processing software, 
but it's not always easy. Getting the labels properly aligned with the software 
can be tricky. Some programs come with predesigned templates for popular label 
sizes, but I've never had much luck getting them to work just right. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to print labels with your word processing, spreadsheet or 
database program, it's a good idea to experiment with plain paper before 
wasting expensive label stock. 
</P>
<P>
Avery has been in the label business for as long as I can remember, but to keep 
up with the times, it's also now in the software business with programs for the 
IBM PC and Mac. 
</P>
<P>
The company publishes two LabelPro products for IBM-compatibles. One is 
designed especially for laser printers and the other for dot matrix printers. A 
single Macintosh version works with the Apple LaserWriter and ImageWriter (dot 
matrix) printers, as well as the Hewlett Packard DeskJet. 
</P>
<P>
All the versions allow you to integrate text and graphics on your labels. The 
program comes with a selection of "clip art" but also works with standard 
graphic files, making it possible, for example, to include a company logo that 
has been scanned into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Although they accomplish the same tasks, the Mac and PC versions are quite 
different. The Mac version takes advantage of that machine's graphical user 
interface to provide you with a "what you see is what you get" environment for 
designing your labels. The Mac version allows you to paste graphic images from 
just about any Macintosh graphics program and gives you access to all text 
styles available on your Mac. 
</P>
<P>
The IBM PC version, which allows you to place graphics in pre-specified 
locations, comes with two type styles that can be printed in any size from 6 to 
96 points. The dot matrix version offers three fonts plus your printer's 
resident fonts. It also prints colors on color printers. 
</P>
<P>
Each version comes with a small sample of Avery label stock. In addition to 
gummed labels, you can use the software to print Rolodex or index cards, using 
special dot matrix or laser card stock available from an office supplies 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Avery, of course, makes it easy for you to use the product with the company's 
own label stock. The program's menu, for example, allows you to select the 
label stock by Avery catalogue number. However, I see no reason the program 
wouldn't work with label stock from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Avery LabelPro comes with its own simple database management program that can 
be used to enter address lists. The IBM PC version works with files created by 
dBase III and IV and WordPerfect, as well as standard text files. The Macintosh 
version supports most Macintosh database and word processing files. 
</P>
<P>
The Avery LabelPro software has a suggested retail price of $99.95, but I've 
seen it on sale for a lot less. Avery can be reached at (818) 915-3851.

Stephen A. Schwartz, president of the Playskool division of toy maker Hasbro 
Inc., has quit rather than accede to a management shake-up that would have 
moved him down the corporate chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
Hasbro's announcement said Schwartz, 41, resigned "to pursue other business 
opportunities." Under Schwartz, Playskool was Hasbro's fastest-growing division 
the past two years. The new arrangement would have had Schwartz reporting to 
Alfred J. Verrecchia, who has been made chief operating officer for Hasbro's 
domestic toy operations. Schwartz had been reporting directly to Alan G. 
Hassenfeld, Hasbro chairman and chief executive.

MUSIC: THE MOOD WAS AS LAVISH AS THE SETTING AT SUMMERFEST '90, WHERE PRAISE 
FLOWED LIKE WINE FOR THE COMING OF AGE OF THE LA JOLLA CONCERT SERIES.

<P>
If the mood makes the party, the mood at the SummerFest '90 gala given Saturday 
at the Romona Sahm estate was one of self-congratulation, leavened with a dash 
of awe and the faintest touch of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The object of all these semi-defined feelings was the uncontested coming of age 
of the SummerFest concert series, founded in 1986 by the La Jolla Chamber Music 
Society and now, according to its backers, the subject of not only national 
attention but national acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
The SummerFest '90 series opened Friday night at Sherwood Auditorium in La 
Jolla, and will continue there through Tuesday under the direction of 
conductors Heiichiro Ohyama and Andre Previn. The works performed survey the 
chamber format rather comprehensively, ranging from Mozart concertos to 
contemporary pieces written by 35-year-old New York composer Bruce Adolphe. 
</P>
<P>
"The artists say this is one of the most important chamber music venues," said 
Robert Doede, one of the principal series founders. "Many say that they would 
rather play here than anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
"'We're really moving into the big time," added Marie Olesen, past president of 
the music society. "In five years, we have come to be viewed by the musicians 
as the best chamber music festival in the country. Opening night was fabulous, 
and the Schumann piece (Piano Quintet in E-flat Major, Opus 44) was as good as 
you'll hear." 
</P>
<P>
The 110 guests at Saturday's gala -- all concert series patrons who contributed 
a minimum of $1,000 per couple -- were invited to hear a mid-evening program of 
works by Persichetti, Faure and Beethoven, offered as a musical intermezzo 
between a lavish champagne reception and an equally lavish dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The setting lent itself to the peculiar requirements of the gala, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
The Sahm estate, over the years, has been the site of the first two "A Night in 
Monte Carlo" balls for the then-La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, of the 
annual Christmas musicale jointly sponsored by the San Diego Symphony and the 
San Diego Opera, of country-Western hoedowns for the Voices for Children 
Auxiliary and, in the early 1980s, of the only three "throlf" tournaments known 
to have been given anywhere on this planet. Throlf, a pristinely wacky game 
that calls for golf balls to be thrown from hole to hole, was the brainchild of 
La Jolla's Lawrence Waddy; the tournaments benefited the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
But, for Saturday's event, the massive house provided a soaring glass and wood 
music room spacious enough to accommodate the musicians and guests in comfort, 
one with acoustics that several musicians compared favorably to those of a good 
concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
As flutist Carol Wincenc and harpist Deborah Hoffman settled in for the opening 
piece, Persichetti's Serenade No. 10 (Opus 79), the mood in and outside the 
room seemed to shift with them -- the crowd grew notably silent and intense, 
and the sky brooding behind them darkened from the dusky blue of an Indian 
sapphire to an imperfect onyx irradiated with flecks of stars. Just as the 
music took a particularly sharp turn into a flying scherzando, the mood was 
broken by the emphatic croaking of the many frogs the populate the ponds beside 
Sahm's front walk. Closing the doors took care of the unexpected amphibian 
obbligato. 
</P>
<P>
After the concert, which included Faure's brief but beguiling "Morceau de 
Concours" and Beethoven's String Trio in G Major (Opus 9, No. 1), perennial 
SummerFest sponsor Peter Preuss related the music to the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the few occasions upon which chamber music is played in the 
setting it was meant for," he said. "The gala audience replicates the classic 
chamber music audience, which almost gives tonight a sense of nostalgia. 
Chamber music sounds best in a private home." 
</P>
<P>
Guests fortified themselves for the concert by browsing on an hors d'oeuvres 
buffet arranged by caterer John Baylin, who "painted" Picasso-like 
representations of a lute and a woman's face in capers, chopped salmon and 
caviars of various colors, all applied to an edible canvas of cream cheese. One 
of those inspecting the display was current music society President Brenda 
Baker, who said that musicians now request a billet on the SummerFest program. 
"We're attracting national attention to San Diego," she said. "Artists are 
coming to us from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Baylin served in a setting of some drama, around the massive indoor pool that 
occupies the farthest wing of the house. Gala Chairman Peggy Preuss decorated 
the tables formally with extravagant bouquets of white roses clustered around 
silver candelabra; the meal included grilled duck breast with exotic relishes 
and a hot-and-cold salad of sauteed forest mushrooms and chilled greens. "The 
SummerFest gala is becoming a significant event for San Diego," she said. "It's 
a state of mind that calls for elegance and glamour." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the principal musicians, including pianists Emanuel and Yoko Ax and 
violinist Gyorgy Pauk, joined the dinner as guests; many also found themselves 
renewing old acquaintances, since music society board members and sponsors 
traditionally house the visiting artists. 
</P>
<P>
SummerFest artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama and his wife, artist Gail Ohyama, 
headed a guest list that included festival General Chairman Lois Kohn; Sharon 
and Neil Derrough; Roger Revelle; Romona Sahm with Chuck LaBar; Bea and Bob 
Epsten; Marcia and Harvey Schuster; Beverly and Joseph Glickman; Lynn 
Hillegrund with Stephen Zahorik; Suzanne and John Koch.

Going Up and Coming Down 
</P>
<P>
Elevators are not ordinarily found in San Fernando Valley houses, so builder 
Frank Thompson thought -- what with the soft real estate market and all -- that 
putting them into eight of his new two-story Woodland Hills hillside houses 
might be a great marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank figured elevators might appeal to an untapped group of buyers," said 
Jeff Oblas of Fred Sands Realty who is in charge of selling the houses and lots 
in the mini-development. "He thought that maybe disabled people might be 
interested, or people with bad backs or gimpy knees." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work out that way at all. 
</P>
<P>
According to Oblas, all five of the eight houses with lifts that have been sold 
were bought in spite of them, rather than because of them. Oblas thinks that's 
because people in the Valley are only used to thinking of elevators in 
commercial buildings or apartment houses, where someone else is responsible for 
their maintenance. "I think people were concerned about what would happen if 
something went wrong. They probably worried that the kids might get stuck in 
them or that they would break down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oblas said that instead of stressing the elevators, maybe the sales promotions 
for the development should have focused on the view the houses offered of the 
surrounding hills and valleys, or maybe on the fact that the three houses that 
are left have been reduced in price $150,000 or more, from around $750,000 to 
between $575,000 and $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Oblas, on reflection, remembers one weekend when the place was swarming with 
elevator aficionados, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We tagged utility poles with little notices about a weekend open house in the 
homes with elevators, and about 50 neighborhood kids dragged their parents over 
to see them," Oblas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wheeler Dealers in Training 
</P>
<P>
Jack Ohringer, general manager of the newly redecorated Fashion Square in 
Sherman Oaks, thought it would be capital to invite Monopoly addicts to play in 
the fancy, newly decked out Center Court area of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
It was a strange promotional idea for a mall manager since most of them would 
rather have people spending money than watching other people playing with it. 
</P>
<P>
But Ohringer said the promotion did what it was supposed to do: create interest 
at the square. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen or so hard-core Monopoholics were expected to be interested or 
confident enough to give up a weekend to play in front of back-to-school 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
What a shock to have more than 100 of the greedily acquisitive come to play, 
Ohringer said, with about 80 signing up in advance and 20 more just showing up. 
</P>
<P>
To anyone supposing money lust had become unfashionable -- what with the 
rumored downfall of The Donald, or the downfall of professional greed heads 
like Ivan Boesky and our own Valley boy Michael Milken -- a trip past the 
hotel-building, opponent-bankrupting gamesters playing at the Sherman Oaks 
Fashion Square would have meant being quickly disabused. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Russia in Reseda 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost came at an opportune time for Soviet refugee Ark Kivman. When he 
arrived in the United States from Odessa five years ago, and opened his Moscow 
Nights restaurant on Sherman Way in Reseda, his patrons were mostly fellow 
Soviets looking for good borscht. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed with the "big thaw," according to restaurant manager Lisa 
Lizshin, who says the place is filled with people toasting Gorby with one of 
the restaurant's 80 brands of vodka. "The people started coming in because 
Gorbachev is a big hero and Russian things are such a big trend. But I think 
they keep coming back because they like the food and because we are a place for 
a party," Lizshin said. "We have a lot of fun here." 
</P>
<P>
The food runs to roast duckling stuffed with apples, prunes and oranges, 
Cornish hen marinated in lemon, garlic and dill, and skewered, marinaded lamb, 
pork and chicken, as well as beef stroganoff, cured fish, red caviar and 
stuffed cabbage. Complete dinners, with salad, borscht, vegetables, rice or 
potato, entree and dessert (like the walnut-filled Kiev cake), run between $15 
and $18. 
</P>
<P>
But Lizshin says the best fun is when people come with a party of four or more. 
"For $27 a person on Friday, $35 a person on Saturday, or $25 a person on 
Sunday you get a huge platter of 16 different Russian hors d'oeuvres, six 
different main courses to choose from, a bottle of liquor, like vodka or 
champagne, and any dessert you want." 
</P>
<P>
The fun comes from the music, which includes a little show put on by the 
six-piece band -- a sort of Gypsy-Russian-Yiddish extravaganza -- followed by 
an evening filled with lively, danceable continental tunes. It is an eye-opener 
to see the lambada done to a balalaika backbeat, Lizshin says. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Women's Liberation? Yes and No 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, women coming into college were mostly concerned with whom 
they were going to marry rather than what they were going to do. 
</P>
<P>
Now, according to Jane Prather, who has a doctorate in sociology and teaches at 
Cal State Northridge, it's just the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to ask women in my classes where they thought they were going to be and 
what they would be doing in 10 years, just to get them thinking about their own 
careers and the future," she said. Even in the late '60s and early '70s, women 
told her they didn't know, because they didn't know whom they would marry. 
Everything hinged on that. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Prather says, women are marrying later, if at all, and are vitally 
interested in making correct career decisions. It's simply assumed that they 
are headed for the career fast track, she says. 
</P>
<P>
With a notable exception. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the women students in her classes are first generation in this country, 
with parents whose values are firmly rooted in the Middle, Near or Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"These women are not quite so liberated," Prather said. "They are still 
attending class under the old suppositions that they will go to school for a 
little while, then become good wives and mothers. Getting educated, for them, 
is something their parents allow as an indulgence," the sociologist said. 
</P>
<P>
One of her brightest students wanted to go to San Diego to law school, but her 
Armenian parents said they couldn't allow such a thing, the educator said. 
</P>
<P>
The student told Prather that traditionally Armenian girls are expected to 
marry when young, and are not allowed to leave their parents' home until they 
become brides. Going away to school would not be allowed because the woman 
would be unchaperoned. 
</P>
<P>
Prather said teaching these cloistered young women has been a learning 
experience for her, and adds a new element to her classes. 
</P>
<P>
"At one end of the spectrum you have the liberated women and at the other end, 
those who are completely sheltered." 
</P>
<P>
The men in her class, she said, are right in the middle, not entirely 
comfortable with either side. 
</P>
<P>

BOLSHOI BALLET'S 'SWAN' IS ONE DULL BIRD

<P>
Not long ago, when Americans considered Soviet artists hostages to an evil 
empire, we accepted the generally appalling state of Soviet choreography as the 
inevitable price for enjoying the unsurpassed greatness of Soviet dancing. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. The freedoms of a new era have raised everyone's expectations -- and 
the familiar junk ballets of the 1990 Bolshoi tour seem a double affront. We've 
certainly never been engaged by them, and now the dancers look equally 
detached. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the company opened its seven-performance engagement at the Civic 
Theatre with the "Swan Lake" that artistic director Yuri Grigorovich patched 
together in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Set in bleak ruins designed by Simon Virsaladze, this is a version that does 
not actually tell a story but rather makes occasional references to one -- as 
if it's aiming to be a dreamlike distillation. Indeed, it sometimes becomes 
literally emblematic when huge, decaying coats of arms descend to ornament 
major junctures in the action. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the mime passages of the original that represented conversations in 
movement, Grigorovich has people stand around mindlessly bowing to one another 
or simply waiting until the music allows somebody to dance. He further wrecks 
the work's built-in stylistic contrasts by putting the national dances onto 
pointe -- but remains a staunch traditionalist regarding those three fixtures 
of Soviet stagings: the Tutor, the Jester and the happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
Diligently conducted by Algis Zhuraitis, the Tchaikovsky score has been 
reworked to incorporate passages deleted from most productions -- including the 
long-lost Russian dance. The most troublesome novelty: an intense pas d'action 
for Odile, Rothbart, Siegfried and a swan mini-corps just preceding (and in a 
completely different style from) the Black Swan pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when this confused and fundamentally hollow collage could 
command committed execution. Look at the swans in the first lakeside scene: 
Like the corps, the four cygnets dispatch their choreography efficiently but 
with no real spirit -- and the swan trio that immediately follows proves 
disastrous in both timing and placement. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the vulgar and unmusical bravura assigned to both the meticulous 
Mikhail Sharkov as the Jester and the reckless Alexander Vetrov as Rothbart. In 
the name of expanding opportunities for males in "the classics," Grigorovich 
has made such men into caricatures of disruptive athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to artists condemned to this kind of showcase? They either grow 
grimly insular (Vetrov) or descend into fey mannerism (Maria Bilova, cast on 
Tuesday in the pas de trois of the opening scene). This is a company with 
plenty of examples at both extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Because vestiges remain of Petipa and Ivanov, this "Swan Lake" becomes 
periodically classical, allowing the Swan Queen and Siegfried (no less than the 
audience) access to something authentic and purposeful. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the triumphant dynamism of Nina Ananiashvili complemented the 
serene refinement of Alexei Fadeyechev in unexpected but exciting ways. With 
her extraordinary upper-torso strength and magnificent ability to flow through 
the choreography, Ananiashvili danced even the most lyrical passages at heroic 
scale. Yet the sweetly smiling Fadeyechev made her appear a projection of his 
needs: a dream-lover he conjured up and then protected with partnering of 
ravishing tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
Fadeyechev wasn't always faultless in the virtuoso challenges, and Ananiashvili 
looked oddly prosaic in her first lakeside solo (after the White Swan duet), 
but nevertheless they exemplified the brilliant abilities of this Bolshoi 
generation -- abilities deserving something better than Grigorovich's botched 
modernization of a 19th-Century masterwork. 
</P>
<P>
Can they hope to find what they deserve within this company or elsewhere in 
Moscow? In Leningrad, perhaps? In London? The question is anything but 
speculative these days, and the reputation of the Bolshoi anything but assured. 
</P>

CENTER TO GIVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO VIDEO GEAR

<P>
Access is the key word in the name of the San Diego Media Access Center. 
</P>
<P>
Established last spring, the group consists of little more than an office, a 
brochure and a multitude of intentions. Soon, however -- as soon as next month 
when the group begins a program of film and video screenings at the Central 
Library downtown -- the center could become a rallying point for non-commercial 
video and film producers and their audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Now, independent producers working outside of the academic womb face a daunting 
array of obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
If $400-an-hour rates at video production facilities don't sap their creative 
juices, the near impossibility of showing their works in San Diego will. More 
affordable access to production equipment, better access to information about 
cable television screening opportunities and access of producers and viewers 
alike to regular public showings of work in the independent media are high on 
the agenda of SDMAC, as its founders begin to tackle the needs of the local 
media community. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is the support for people with ideas but no access?" asked John Walden, 
a video maker schooled at UC San Diego and one of the founders of the new media 
access center. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wasil, another of SDMAC's founders, recognized the problem several years 
ago when he was the director of Installation, an alternative gallery that 
closed its downtown space last year. The gallery began to hold screenings of 
independent film and video before it closed, but Wasil had grander ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Long Beach Museum of Art was the model I held up," Wasil said. "They offer 
grants, fellowship support, access to cable, a viable exhibition program, 
production support -- that was all non-existent here." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Museum's program, the oldest and most active museum program in 
the country to address and support the media arts, is "wonderful," agreed 
Walden, "but it's too far away." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1974, Long Beach's program features changing exhibitions of video 
art and several forms of technical assistance for artists, including use of the 
museum's video annex, a fully equipped production facility. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Buffalo, Baltimore, New York and many other cities 
all offer a support structure for their local filmmakers and video makers, in 
the form of a media center, such as the fledgling SDMAC, or through programs in 
existing institutions. San Diego, too, has the potential to be a major site of 
independent video production and exhibition, supporters of SDMAC say, largely 
because of the city's two outstanding university programs in the media arts. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD and San Diego State University offer instruction and technical support for 
students pursuing a range of directions, from producing video art to 
documentary film. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 serious production students graduate each year from UCSD, 
according to Sherman George, head of the university's media center. Each 
quarter, an average of 420 students use the well-equipped center. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU is also actively training future generations of media mavens through its 
telecommunications and film department, chaired by Dr. Michael Real. Because of 
the universities, San Diego has yielded a disproportionately high percentage of 
the independent video makers whose work appears in museums and on cable 
stations nationwide, but the city hasn't exerted much effort to hold on to that 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Graduates will stay here if there is some media activity here they can hook 
into," said DeeDee Halleck, a communications professor at UCSD and co-founder 
of Paper Tiger Television, a cable-access show and media center in New York. 
"They need space to work, to band together and share equipment, a place to 
exhibit and give each other support." 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of using video production equipment is the most startling and 
discouraging of challenges facing graduates and other independent producers. 
Many UCSD students prolong graduation so they can maintain their privileges at 
the media center, George said, avoiding the $400 commercial rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Six-year media students are six-year media students by their own choice. They 
realize that, within this environment, they have the best opportunity to do 
their work." 
</P>
<P>
Founders of the San Diego Media Access Center are hoping to broaden those 
opportunities by arranging more affordable access to commercial production 
facilities. Many businesses offer substantially lower rates to makers of 
non-commercial video if they use the facility on standby during off hours, 
usually late night and early morning. 
</P>
<P>
Now, video makers desiring such rates "must rely on an individual's sense of 
compassion," said Louis Hock, a UCSD professor and widely exhibited video 
artist who has often negotiated his own rates at production houses. "It would 
be great to know that there were established rates I could depend on." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Fagin, a video artist who also teaches at UCSD, sees such an arrangement 
as a gesture of community responsibility but not necessarily a burden on 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it's worked out as a reciprocal relation. For every editing job 
I do, I bring in five more customers. It's a community service that serves both 
sides. It also allows people who run these businesses to work on some 
interesting projects." 
</P>
<P>
Once such projects are completed, local video makers face another formidable 
challenge: finding a place to show them. When Installation gallery's screening 
program ended, it created "a real hole in the community," said Halleck. The San 
Diego Museum of Contemporary Art has operated a "video porch" since 1984, where 
visitors can choose from a menu of tapes in the museum's collection, but Wasil 
calls the museum's efforts "perfunctory." 
</P>
<P>
In September, he and the other SDMAC founders will begin offering monthly film 
and video screenings in the auditorium at Central Library, 820 E St. The first 
program, organized by SDMAC co-founder Eloise de Leon, will feature three works 
representing artists' different motivations for using video, as a means of 
autobiography, for instance, or as a political tool. In the future, the group 
plans to schedule traveling exhibitions of video as well as open screenings. 
</P>
<P>
Another opportunity for video makers to show their work lies in public-access 
television. By law, cable stations are required to provide a certain amount of 
broadcast time and technical assistance to the community, but, according to 
Wasil, it's an opportunity that remains largely untapped. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't know that they can go down to their local cable station 
and screen a panel discussion on inadequate child care, or why there isn't a 
public park in their neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of SDMAC's goals is to act as a liaison between independent producers and 
cable stations, and to fulfill the potential of television, what Wasil calls 
"the ultimate democratic communication tool." Using cable access, he said, "is 
an empowering method for individuals and small groups who don't have the means 
to reach a larger audience." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not SDMAC will have the means to fulfill its potential remains to be 
seen. The founding group -- which also includes Suzanne Sedivec, Dan Martin and 
Chelle Draper -- has applied for several grants and expects some funding from 
city or county agencies. This month it will be mailing membership brochures 
and, in October, a "video scavenger hunt" may serve as a fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, SDMAC exists because of the energies and support of its 
founders, all of whom have worked in video and yearned for more contact with 
their peers, a stronger support system and greater access to the eyes and ears 
of the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We're inventing something that doesn't exist," said Wasil, "but we know what 
other venues have and haven't done. We know how to reach the art community. How 
to reach everybody else? We'll have to experiment." 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: A MELLOWER MOUZON IS DUE AT HUMPHREY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the mid-1970s, drummer Alphonse Mouzon pounded himself into the minds of 
fusion jazz fans with his machine-gun attack behind guitarist Larry Coryell in 
The Eleventh House band. Mouzon has diversified and mellowed since then. During 
the 1980s, he turned out a series of light jazz recordings packed with lush 
melodies and thick electronic instrumentation, but little of his former fire. 
</P>
<P>
His newest album, "As You Wish," released this year, continues this lighter 
mode. Mouzon plays drums, digital drums, electric bass, percussion and assorted 
synthesizers, with saxophonist Gary Meeks doing the lion's share of the melodic 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
Mouzon is also engrossed in a legal battle with Optimism, his label from 
1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
Among his charges are that he received only $13,000 in royalties from his 1988 
hit album, "Early Spring," which the label says sold 50,000 to 60,000 copies. 
Mouzon said he should have netted about $70,000. Optimism also rereleased the 
1981 "Morning Sun" album on compact disc in 1988 without Mouzon's permission, 
making a new pirate master tape from the original vinyl LP -- the resulting 
sound quality was horrible. After several stages of trial proceedings, Mouzon 
has received $16,250 from Optimism for copyright infringement. He was awarded 
an additional $28,000 earlier this month, but must wait six months while 
Optimism appeals. Eventually, he wants a retrial, and he seeks a settlement of 
at least $3 million, down from his original request of $14 million for a 
variety of violations of his deal with Optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has discovered a new source of income -- licensing his music to 
televised soap operas and sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I made $8,000 in June from 'General Hospital' and 'One Life to Live,' and I 
can make $4,000 during one weekend of golf on 'CBS Sports,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mouzon is mixing a new album for release later this year or early next, and he 
also hopes to remake some of his '70s fusion music, record an acoustic jazz 
album and maybe even a heavy metal session. 
</P>
<P>
With all of his successes and experience, it seems odd that Mouzon would be 
tabbed for next Wednesday night's "Rising Star Concert" at the Catamaran Resort 
Hotel in Mission Beach. Mouzon will concentrate on music from his most recent 
albums, including "As You Wish," "Early Spring," "Back to Jazz" and "Love 
Fantasy," backed by his touring band. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the broad-minded Mouzon, veteran jazz drummer Louis Hayes continues in 
the pure acoustic jazz vein he started out in during the 1950s, in bands led by 
pianist Horace Silver and reed man Yusef Lateef, and continued in during the 
1960s in bands headed by saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and pianist Oscar 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes plays Elario's next Monday and Tuesday nights with his own band, 
including Charles Tolliver on trumpet, Clint Houston on bass, George Cables on 
piano and John Stubblefield on sax. 
</P>
<P>
Sets will include music from Hayes' "Una Max" album, released earlier this year 
and named in honor of fellow drummer Max Roach. Hayes said being a leader 
doesn't make him play drums any differently than he would on someone else's 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference is I'm more in control if I want to have certain things 
featuring myself. A lot of times if the drummer is not the leader, people just 
want the rhythm section to fit in." On "Una Max," Hayes gave himself three drum 
solos, and promised several in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad ends its summer outdoor jazz series with a performance from 6 to 8 
tomorrow night by Ira Liss and the Big Band Jazz Machine in Magee Park at 
Carlsbad Boulevard and Beech Street. The program grew to nine shows this year 
from six last year. Colleen Finnegan, the city's community arts coordinator, 
pronounced the events "very successful," and said they drew at least 400 to 450 
listeners to local parks each week. There were glitches, though. The most 
glaring was the scheduled Aug. 10 appearance by Gene Perry and his group Afro 
Rumba. Perry didn't show up for the date and sent stand-ins, including 
multi-instrumentalist Turiya and keyboard man Joe Garrison. "I did not get five 
guys in matching shirts banging out the Caribbean beat," Finnegan lamented. "I 
got five musicians doing standards with a Latin beat." 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Top jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour, a capable player in both straight-ahead 
and lighter commercial modes, plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay at 7 and 9 
p.m. Friday. Saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. is on at Humphrey's this Monday 
night at 7 and 9. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jazz plays a part in this weekend's Music &amp; Arts Fair at Robb Field in 
Ocean Beach, a benefit for the Ocean Beach Recovery and Referral Institute, 
which offers daily meetings of Cocaine Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous and 
other recovery groups. Trumpeter Mitch Manker and his group play at 11 a.m., 
followed by Kokopelli, featuring Turiya, Joe Garrison and Dave Millard about 
1:30. . . . 
</P>

<P>
DEAR SOS: When I was young, my favorite birthday cake was one my mother bought 
at the old candy ice cream parlor, Blum's in Beverly Hills -- something called 
Coffee Crunch Cake. It was a light white cake with whipped cream and a 
delicious coating of coffee-flavored honeycomb candy. I seem to recall that you 
published the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANNE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ANNE: Blum's may be gone but the cake lives on in our files. 
</P>
<P>
BLUM'S COFFEE CRUNCH CAKE 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup strong coffee 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1 cup whipping cream, whipped 
</P>
<P>
1 (8-ounce) angel-food cake 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, coffee and corn syrup in saucepan at least 5 inches deep. Bring 
mixture to boil and cook until it reaches 310 degrees on candy thermometer or 
reaches hard-crack stage (when small amount dropped in cold water breaks with 
brittle snap). 
</P>
<P>
Press baking soda through sieve to remove lumps. Remove syrup from heat. 
Immediately add baking soda and stir vigorously just until mixture thickens and 
pulls away from sides of pan. (Mixture foams rapidly when soda is added. Do not 
destroy foam by beating excessively.) 
</P>
<P>
Immediately pour foamy mass into ungreased 9-inch square metal pan (do not 
spread or stir). Let stand without moving, until cool. When ready to garnish 
cake, knock topping mixture out of pan and crush between sheets of wax paper 
with rolling pin to form coarse crumbs. Frost cake with whipped cream. Cover 
frosted cake generously and thoroughly with crushed topping. Refrigerate until 
ready to serve. Makes 1 (9-inch) cake. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I've lost my recipe for enchiladas suizas. It was a short, simple 
method. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TERRY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR TERRY: Is this it? The recipe makes a good party dish. For appetizers use 
the small-size tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
MARTINE HECHT'S ENCHILADAS SUIZAS 
</P>
<P>
4 cups cubed cooked chicken or turkey 
</P>

<P>
With its Chinese, Japanese, Polynesian, Portuguese and American influences, 
Hawaiian cuisine is often described as complex melting-pot cookery. In reality 
it offers simple tastes with minimal spicing and easy preparation. The entrees 
themselves, which are not necessarily colorful, can be attractive when 
embellished with exotic fruits and flowers. Here are two dishes chosen from a 
selection of favorite foods sent in by Janet Martin, who was born and raised in 
Hilo, Hawaii.

THE BIRTH OF A PIE RECIPE: IT STARTED WITH A KISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"How do you think up the recipes?" That's a question food writers hear 
frequently. But the usual answer, "Well, it depends," doesn't help much. But 
it's true. So in the interest of greater understanding, here's the story on 
today's offering, a chocolate hazelnut pie. The recipe began at a benefit 
community supper climaxed by a ravishing display of pie -- a 3-foot-wide, 
16-foot-long stretch paved with row after row of strawberry, rhubarb, apple, 
cherry, lemon chiffon, lemon meringue, chocolate fudge, chocolate mousse, 
banana cream, coconut custard, pecan, apple crumb . . . 17 flavors in all, not 
counting the cheesecakes. 
</P>
<P>
I've had pie on my mind ever since. But what kind of pie? Surely the world 
needs no more recipes for classic fruit pies. (What we need in that department 
are people willing to make them.) I finally decided the pie should be 
chocolate; all the people I know and love and make pie for are chocolate fans. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the people I love the best is a man who has a special weakness for 
Baci (kisses): bite-size Italian confections that combine bittersweet chocolate 
with roasted hazelnuts in a way that Hershey's would do very well to learn 
from. 
</P>
<P>
OK, Baci pie it is. But how to make it? None of my favorite chocolate mousse 
fillings can be published now that uncooked eggs are on the out list, so the 
creamy chocolate part will have to come from baked custard and whipped cream. 
The nut layer should be nougat-like, so it's derived from the almond tart that 
Lindsey Shere perfected for Berkeley's renowned Chez Panisse restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The crust is basically old-fashioned flaky piecrust, but it's made even richer 
and flakier by being bound with sour cream instead of water, an idea that comes 
from the "counterfeit puff pastry" given in Maida Heatter's "Book of Great 
Desserts." 
</P>
<P>
All of this is absolutely typical. You get an idea, then you go with what you 
know, borrowing a little here and a little there. Then, if what you're making 
is Baci pie, you eat nothing else for about three days so the calories in a 
single slice don't rise up and kill you dead. 
</P>
<P>
BACI PIE 
</P>
<P>
8 ounces hazelnuts (filberts), scant 2 cups 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups whipping cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons Frangelico or other hazelnut liqueur 
</P>
<P>
Crust 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
3 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Cream 
</P>
<P>
Spread hazelnuts on shallow pan and toast at 350 degrees 15 minutes or until 
golden. Cool, then rub between palms to remove as much skin as possible. Grind 
nuts into coarse crumbs and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar with 3/4 cup whipping cream in heavy, non-reactive saucepan. 
Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, until mixture thickens to texture of 
light cream sauce, about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in nuts and liqueur. Pour warm filling into Crust, increase oven heat to 
400 degrees and bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until filling is lightly browned and 
almost set. (Will bubble up and then subside.) 
</P>
<P>
Grind or chop chocolate into fine crumbs, then stir in egg yolks. Heat 
remaining 3/4 cup cream just to boiling point. Pour over chocolate, stirring 
until mixture is smooth. Gently pour chocolate mixture onto pie filling, return 
to oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees. Bake another 12 to 15 minutes or until 
chocolate layer is just set. Cool on rack and chill thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Completely cover top of pie with Chocolate Cream, putting cream through pastry 
tube or swirling decoratively with back of spoon. Serve at once. Makes 1 
(9-inch) pie, or 9 to 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Crust 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons lard or solid shortening 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, salt and sugar in bowl. Rub in lard with fingers (or use food 
processor) until mixture resembles meal. Cut or process in butter only until 
large lumps about size of baby lima beans form. Add sour cream and stir or 
process as briefly as possible, until dough holds together. 
</P>
<P>
Form dough into round cake, about 1-inch thick, wrap tightly in plastic wrap 
and chill 3 to 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Roll dough between 2 sheets wax paper to 1/8-inch thickness. Chill. Line oven 
bottom with foil to catch any drips. Press foil onto 9-inch pie pan, shiny side 
down, to obtain shape of pan. Remove foil and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Peel wax paper from dough, fit pastry into pan and cover with pre-shaped foil, 
pressing so foil is snug all around. Bake at 375 degrees 20 minutes or until 
set, then remove foil and continue baking until shell is lightly browned, about 
20 minutes longer. Makes 1 (9-inch) crust. 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Cream 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons cocoa powder 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup whipping cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon Frangelico or other hazelnut liqueur 
</P>
<P>
Place cocoa in small, deep bowl and very slowly stir in 1/2 cup whipping cream. 
Cover and chill. At serving time, whip chocolate cream until stiff, then fold 
in sugar and Frangelico.

<P>
This is an unusual recipe for rice pudding. It actually started out as a 
revision of a recipe sent to me by a reader from Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
I found her recipe a bit bland, and by the time I got through with it I could 
no longer call it a revision of her original recipe. 
</P>
<P>
However, I now like it so much I want to share it. Try serving it with fresh 
fruit for a touch of color. It's a delightful finish for a summer meal. 
</P>
<P>
ALMOND RICE PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped raw almonds 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup long-grain brown rice 
</P>
<P>
1 envelope unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup cold water 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups canned skimmed evaporated milk, well-chilled 
</P>
<P>
Toast almonds in 350-degree oven 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Combine 
nonfat milk, water and salt in heavy saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat. 
Slowly add rice, stirring constantly 2 minutes. Reduce heat to very low and 
cook, covered, 1 hour, stirring occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Soften gelatin in cold water and add to hot rice mixture. Stir until completely 
dissolved. Add vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar. Mix well and set aside to cool. 
</P>
<P>
Place very cold evaporated milk in cold mixing bowl and beat until soft peaks 
form. Slowly beat in remaining sugar. Fold whipped milk and toasted almonds 
into cooled rice mixture and chill until firm, at least 3 hours. Serve with 
fresh fruit. Makes 10 cups.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THE FIGHT AGAINST OBESITY SHOULD START EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being obese is no more fun for children than for adults. Compared to their 
slimmer peers, overweight children have a higher incidence of bone and joint 
problems, breathing difficulties and respiratory infections, as well as a 
greater chance of elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure. If they remain 
obese as adults, they can look forward to a higher risk of hypertension, 
diabetes and osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
But the most debilitating aspects of obesity for children are social and 
psychological. In a society that values thinness, obese people are virtually a 
despised minority group. Children seeking identity and peer acceptance are 
especially vulnerable to teasing about their appearance, ridicule for 
clumsiness at games and exclusion from group activities. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that obesity can prejudice ratings at school and acceptance 
to college. Not surprisingly, obese children, like those in recognized minority 
groups, often have poor self-images, a sense of failure and inferiority and a 
passive approach to life. 
</P>
<P>
Heredity plays a role in obesity. But so does environment, which is subject to 
modification. Extreme as it sounds, the time to begin thinking about obesity 
prevention is when your baby is born. We're not for a moment encouraging the 
potentially dangerous practice of restricting calories for infants or children. 
We are advising, though, that you pay attention to sound principles of diet and 
exercise, beginning at birth. 
</P>
<P>
Fat babies may or may not become obese children. However, there's a strong 
likelihood that an obese child will become an obese adult. Once the problem 
appears, it's difficult to treat, especially in children. Established eating 
habits are hard to change, and fat cells, once formed, are there for life. 
</P>
<P>
Fat cells, in fact, are formed and begin to fill with lipid before birth. Obese 
women and women who gain an excessive amount of weight (50 pounds or more) 
during pregnancy have babies with larger than usual reservoirs of fat. The fat 
cells a baby is born with reach adult size during the first year of life. Then 
the number of cells begins to multiply, rising five-fold between a the time a 
child is 1 year old and 22 years old. 
</P>
<P>
It's not known whether new fat cells go on forming in adulthood if overeating 
requires new energy storage. What is well documented is that small children who 
are consistently overfed will develop an excessive number of fat cells for that 
age. That doesn't mean that a child who's obese at age 2 or 3 will inevitably 
be obese at 22. Even though that child has more fat cells than its peers, it 
has fewer than a thin adult, and may gradually grow out of it. 
</P>
<P>
At every age, the balance between calories eaten in food and calories expended 
in activity equals weight stability. Part of the input-output equation for 
children is the calories used in growth. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reduce the weight of an obese child must concentrate on stepped-up 
physical activity. Psychological counseling and support and careful reduction 
of calories also are critical. If weight is maintained or weight gain is 
reduced for several months, growth itself will take care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term treatment of childhood obesity is generally no more successful than 
treatment for adults. Prevention is far better, and it can start before the 
baby learns to walk. Pediatricians usually recommend breast-feeding for the 
first four to six months, then slowly introducing baby foods. 
</P>
<P>
Mother's milk is the best food for infants, and breast-feeding gives the baby 
some control of food intake. With bottle-feeding, the parent is more likely to 
insist that the baby "clean the plate" or to use food as a pacifier. Some 
overfed babies triple their weight in five months, while the general rule is 
that weight should triple in a child's first year. 
</P>
<P>
At each visit, the pediatrician checks length (later on, height) and weight 
against a growth chart geared to age. If the growth rate has been above the 
50th percentile, and weight is getting out of hand, the doctor will suggest 
several measures. 
</P>
<P>
First -- and this applies to the whole family -- provide a diet of tasty foods 
that meet nutrient needs and, for the child, provide sufficient calories for 
lean tissue growth. 
</P>
<P>
Second, avoid using food as a reward or punishment. Don't make children clean 
their plates. The latter is particularly tempting with 1-year-olds, who 
commonly seem "to lose their appetite." Actually, this is a normal response to 
the slowing of the growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
Third, emphasize physical exercise, whenever possible in the context of family 
activities. Obese children, including fat babies still in the crib, tend to 
move much less than thinner children, although they may eat no more. Play 
active games with babies and toddlers and ration TV sessions for older tots. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing family activities such as hiking, walking, swimming and bike riding 
will encourage children to use more energy, provide psychological support and 
make regular exercise seem as much a part of life as regular meals. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I love avocados, but should I worry about cholesterol when I eat 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. Only animal foods contain cholesterol, so avocados have none. 
However, they do have something that sets them apart from all other fruits: 
oil. This translates into extra calories. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how much oil you'll get depends on the type of avocado. By law, 
California avocados cannot contain less than 8% fat. At times they might have 
as much as 20% fat, depending on the season. Florida doesn't set standards for 
the amount of fat in its avocados; they also tend to be lower in fat. 
</P>
<P>
Three ounces of raw Florida avocado would provide approximately 95 calories, 68 
of them from fat. Three ounces of California avocado would have about 153 
calories, 134 of them from fat (and most of the rest from carbohydrate). 
</P>
<P>
Avocados are believed to be native to Mexico. They weren't grown commercially 
in this country until the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does pumpernickel bread have a lot of fiber? 
</P>
<P>
A: The best answer we can give you is a qualified "sometimes." Most often, the 
answer is probably no. 
</P>
<P>
Why the discrepancy? The reason is that there are many kinds of pumpernickel. 
If the bread is made mainly from whole-wheat flour, along with dark-rye flour 
and unbolted cornmeal, it will indeed be high in fiber. But some bread that 
goes by the name of pumpernickel is actually made with refined white flour and 
de-germed cornmeal and may have very little fiber -- aside from what's provided 
by any caraway seeds it might contain. 
</P>
<P>
When we checked five pumpernickel recipes, we were surprised by some of the 
ingredients. Four of the five listed mashed potatoes. One used cocoa, another 
chocolate. At the supermarket, the labels revealed that the most important 
ingredient in several loaves was refined bleached flour. Others used whole 
grains, but it wasn't always clear how much. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a fiber-rich pumpernickel, one option is to bake it 
yourself, using lots of whole grains. Another is to inquire at local bakeries 
until you find one that prepares pumpernickel using primarily unrefined flour. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My mother is diabetic. The doctor told her to monitor her blood-sugar 
levels. But my friend's mother, also a diabetic, was advised by her doctor only 
to test her urine. Why was my mother told differently? 
</P>
<P>
A: We can't comment specifically on your mother's case, but we can tell you in 
general why someone would typically be advised to monitor blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
For most diabetics, bringing blood-glucose levels as close as possible to the 
normal, nondiabetic state is a key goal. In controlling the condition, 
blood-glucose values provide a more reliable scoreboard than urine testing. 
</P>
<P>
According to guidelines set out by the American Diabetes Assn., self-monitoring 
of blood glucose was strongly recommended in three situations: in individuals 
receiving intensive insulin therapy (such as those using injections); in women 
who are -- or are planning to become -- pregnant; and in individuals with 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who have a tendency toward hypoglycemia and 
who may not exhibit the symptoms that usually follow a drop in insulin levels. 
</P>
<P>
The association also advocated self-monitoring of blood glucose in several 
other situations. These include routine management of individuals taking 
insulin; those who are "insulin resistant" (meaning that their bodies don't use 
insulin efficiently) and require very large doses; and those in whom blood 
sugar is unusually high or low when sugar appears in the urine. In addition, 
any diabetic patient who, along with his or her physician, is seeking to try to 
gain firmer control over the condition or to make changes in drug therapy might 
be encouraged to monitor blood-glucose levels. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a nickel-lined copper pan that I use for making casseroles. Can the 
nickel migrate into the food and cause poisoning? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. No evidence exists that nickel (or tin, which is also used as a liner) 
will seep into foods in any significant amounts. Besides, nickel is poorly 
absorbed and readily excreted by the body. There have been no reports of 
toxicity linked to nickel-lined pans. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to tin, nickel makes a more durable lining. And if an empty tin-lined 
pan is left on direct heat it's more easily destroyed than the hardier nickel.

MARKETING: IN THE LATEST ROUND OF NUTRITION LABELING, MANUFACTURERS ARE BEING 
URGED TO EASE CONSUMER CONFUSION BY BEING CONSISTENT ABOUT SIZE OF SERVINGS.

A 12-ounce can of diet soda contains two servings, according to the label. One 
brand of juice, packed in a box with one straw, provides 1.4 servings, says the 
package. And some pints of frozen yogurt contain 5 1/3 servings while others 
serve four. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to bring sense and consistency to food labels, the Food and Drug 
Administration last month proposed standardized serving sizes for 159 product 
categories, ranging from caviar to coffee cake. The announcement was made as 
part of the agency's proposed overhaul of food labels, the centerpiece of which 
includes mandatory disclosure of nutrition information on all food packages. 
</P>
<P>
That nutrition information -- which includes a listing of calories, fat and 
sodium -- can fluctuate with the serving size. And that's what concerns FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, serving sizes are left to the manufacturer's discretion, which has 
lead to discrepancies in nutritional data among different brands, said F. 
Edward Scarbrough, acting director of the FDA's Office of Nutrition and Food 
Sciences. "There appears to be a tendency for some manufacturers to manipulate 
serving sizes to make nutritional claims, such as 'low sodium' or 'low 
calorie,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
That practice, he said, was a "big consumer issue" when FDA held public 
hearings around the country about food labeling proposals. 
</P>
<P>
One troublesome product raised by consumers, Scarbrough said, was 12-ounce diet 
soft drinks that list the serving size at two, even though the cans appear to 
be intended for one person. By listing the serving at six ounces, or half a 
can, soda makers can claim that their products are "very low sodium," according 
to the FDA's definition of the term. If the serving size were doubled to a 
whole can, the amount of sodium would be too large to be called "very low." 
</P>
<P>
James Finkelstein, spokesman for the National Soft Drink Assn., denies that the 
industrywide practice is deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is proposing that the serving size for carbonated beverages be set at 
12 ounces, as was common practice in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
An FDA study released last year found that almost half of 44 product categories 
evaluated between 1979 and 1986 had been reduced in size. Aside from diet 
sodas, servings of some brands of soup, crackers and cake mixes have been 
reduced, and a serving of bread went from two slices to one. The study 
concluded that at least some of these adjustments were most likely precipitated 
by growing consumer concern with overconsumption of calories, salt or fat. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this concern is completely different from the one that led some 
food companies in the 1970s to enlarge their serving sizes. When voluntary 
nutrition labeling was first instituted in 1973, deficiencies of vitamins, 
minerals and essential nutrients were a health concern. 
</P>
<P>
FDA's standardized serving sizes are derived from U.S. Department of 
Agriculture surveys of what people actually eat. The proposed serving sizes are 
based on 4,000 foods tracked by USDA in a 1977-78 nationwide consumption 
survey, the most recent and complete data compiled by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Scarbrough said that the serving size section of the agency's labeling overhaul 
was the most difficult, in part because of the diversity of opinion about what 
serving sizes should designate. 
</P>
<P>
"You can choose serving sizes that are recommended, or you can chose those that 
are actually eaten," Scarbrough said, adding that FDA chose what is actually 
eaten because "it is more in line with truth-in-labeling." 
</P>
<P>
There are others who believe that the specific serving size doesn't really 
matter since it is so subjective and that as long as it is consistent, 
consumers can make product comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Knuth, spokeswoman for Kraft-General Foods, said that when it comes to 
serving sizes for salad dressings, "the important thing is that everyone should 
use the same measure." Currently, a serving of salad dressing is listed on most 
labels as one tablespoon. Based on actual food consumption patterns, FDA is 
proposing that the measurement be increased to two tablespoons. 
</P>
<P>
One tablespoon was originally chosen because "it's simpler and easier," said 
Jane MacDonald, manager of technical services for the Assn. for Sauces and 
Dressings. MacDonald said the trade association also objects to FDA's 
assignment of a one tablespoon serving size for mayonnaise, steak sauce, 
Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce and a two tablespoon serving size for salad 
dressings, barbecue and tartar sauces. "There are just so many uses for 
dressings and sauces that it's difficult to say, 'These fall into the one 
tablespoon category, these fall into two tablespoons,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The International Ice Cream Assn. objects to FDA's proposed six-ounce serving 
size for ice cream, ice milk, frozen yogurt and sherbet. "We think the proposal 
is not good because the frozen dessert industry historically has had a 
four-ounce serving size," said Tom Balmer, director of special programs for the 
Washington-based trade group. "It's more in line with traditional Dixie cups, 
and the majority of ice cream scoopers sold in the country deliver a four-ounce 
serving per scoop."

THE BUTCHER: BRUNSWICK STEW: A SQUIRREL-LESS MEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In more than a few parts of this country, when you talk about barbecue you're 
also talking about stew: Brunswick Stew. 
</P>
<P>
From Maryland all down through Virginia, Georgia, the Carolinas to Mississippi, 
some form of a rich, thick hearty soup called Brunswick Stew is a standard 
first course when cooking for a crowd at most any kind of cook-out. 
</P>
<P>
According to most authorities, Brunswick Stew was first prepared in -- and got 
its name from -- Brunswick County, Virginia. And, according to most 
authorities, squirrel is the essential meat of any true Brunswick Stew. There 
are today, however, several variations on the basic theme, probably because 
squirrel is a little hard to come by in some counties. 
</P>
<P>
In most parts of the South, where "Q" and stew are a standard twosome, chicken 
has replaced squirrel as the basis for Brunswick. But chicken, according to the 
folks in Mississippi, "is a feeble substitute for squirrel meat." They are more 
apt to use rabbit when squirrel is unavailable, or a combination of chicken and 
rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, where Brunswick Stew and hush puppies are standard 
"side-kicks" to their famous "pig-pickin's," chicken is combined (quite 
understandably) with country ham. They produce more country ham in North 
Carolina than any place else in the country. In other parts of Dixie, beef, 
veal or pork are combined with chicken in recipes for "authentic" Brunswick 
Stew. 
</P>
<P>
Once the meat is decided on, there are still decisions involved in making a 
Brunswick Stew. Which vegetables to use? Corn and tomatoes are a must, but what 
else? Some Southern cooks put okra in their stew; butter beans are a must for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the thickening to think about. I like Brunswick to be the 
consistency of a rich soup, sort of a Southern version of a good minestrone, 
but a lot of folks in the South like a thicker consistency. Some use a roux, 
some use fine bread crumbs, many try mashed potatoes or white beans or both and 
add them to the pot for thickening. In Louisiana, Brunswick is considered to be 
"kissin' cousin" to gumbo; many cooks there will thicken it with file powder. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, Brunswick Stew, squirrel or no squirrel, is a serious subject 
in the South, and one worthy of study. The recipe that follows is the result of 
my studies on the subject. I have cooked it at charity barbecues all across the 
country from California to Connecticut, and I have it on good authority from a 
lot of folks -- from the owner of the San Francisco Giants to a chef from the 
Cordon Bleu -- that "it's a good stew." 
</P>
<P>
Try it, but after you have, change it to suit your taste. No cook in the South 
will agree that you have an authentic Brunswick Stew, so what else is new? That 
has been true for centuries. No two cooks in all of Dixie have ever agreed on 
what is a real, true Brunswick Stew, so join the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
This recipe makes a lot, eight quarts, but rather than cut it back I would 
recommend that you invite in many friends. Brunswick Stew, whatever it is, is 
not -- nor has it ever been -- a "family meal." It does, however, keep 
wonderfully well, so package any leftovers for the refrigerator or freezer. 
Like most stews, Brunswick gets better from having spent a day or two in the 
refrigerator or some time in the freezer. 
</P>

MICROWAVE: CHOOSE COOKING FRUITS CAREFULLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the exception of berries, summer and fall fruits microwave superbly. Most 
brim with just-picked flavor and look garden-fresh: bright and plump with rich 
fruity bouquet. Still, you must time and tend fruits carefully in the microwave 
oven if you're to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
You must also choose varieties that are "naturals" -- apricots, peaches, pears, 
plums or other firm fruits that can withstand several minutes' worth of 
microwave bombardment without collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with berries, cherries and other soft-pulp fruits is that they're 
so fragile and full of juice they're reduced to mush in seconds. (But this does 
make them dandy candidates for dessert sauces.) 
</P>
<P>
The best pears to poach are Bartlett, Bosc, Anjou or Seckel. Leftover poaching 
syrup can be used to macerate any fresh fruits. 
</P>
<P>
POACHED PEARS CARDINAL 
</P>
<P>
4 large firm-ripe pears (about 1 3/4 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dry white or red wine 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Carefully core pears from bottom, leaving stems intact. Peel and roll in 2 
tablespoons lemon juice to prevent darkening. 
</P>
<P>
Combine remaining tablespoon lemon juice, sugar, wine and vanilla in 
microwave-safe, lidded (8 or 9-inch round, 2-inch deep) casserole. Cover with 
wax paper and microwave on HIGH 2 to 3 minutes, until mixture boils and sugar 
dissolves, stirring at half time. 
</P>
<P>
Stir again and arrange pears on their sides in casserole, spoke-fashion and not 
touching, with stems toward center. Cover with casserole lid and microwave on 
HIGH 6 to 8 minutes until tender-crisp. At half time, turn pears over and 
rotate casserole 180 degrees. Don't overcook as pears will continue cooking as 
they cool. 
</P>
<P>
Cool pears to room temperature in poaching syrup in covered casserole, turning 
occasionally. Chill well. To serve, stand pears in individual goblets. Drizzle 
each with small amount Cardinal Sauce. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sieved, pureed fresh raspberries 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup sugar, about 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon cornstarch blended with 2 tablespoons cold water 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons kirsch 
</P>
<P>
Mix raspberry puree and sugar in microwave-safe 6-cup measure. Cover with wax 
paper and microwave on HIGH 3 minutes. Whisk in cornstarch mixture and lemon 
juice. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until 
sauce boils and thickens slightly. Stir in kirsch. Cool to room temperature. 
Add more sugar if needed or thin if too thick with little water. Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
STEWED APRICOTS OR PLUMS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds firm-ripe apricots or plums (do not peel or pit) 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup hot water 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon finely grated orange or lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
Pierce each apricot or plum in 2 to 3 places and arrange in microwave-safe, 1 
1/2-quart (9-inch round) lidded casserole. Mix in sugar and hot water. Cover 
and microwave on HIGH 4 to 5 minutes, rearranging fruit and turning over at 
half time. 
</P>
<P>
When fruits are barely tender, let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Remove from 
microwave. Stir in orange zest and cool fruit completely in syrup. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
POACHED PEACHES 
</P>
<P>
4 firm-ripe peaches 
</P>
<P>
Lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup hot water 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fruit liqueur, brandy, rum, Port or Madeira 
</P>
<P>
Peel, pit and halve peaches. Dip in lemon juice and arrange in single layer in 
microwave-safe, lidded, 2-quart casserole. Mix in sugar, hot water and fruit 
liqueur. Cover and microwave on HIGH 3 to 3 1/2 minutes, rearranging fruit and 
turning over after 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
When peaches are barely tender, let stand, covered, 1 minute. Remove from 
microwave and cool peaches completely in syrup. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 Watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

RESULTS OF MARGARINE STUDY DOWNPLAYED; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DUTCH RESEARCH LINKING MARGARINE WITH RAISED CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IS 
UNDER ATTACK FROM U.S. INDUSTRY OFFICIALS. THEY CLAIM THE STUDY IS UNREALISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER8/23/90

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nutrition community was stunned last week with the release of research 
indicating that margarine -- heavily promoted as a no-cholesterol food -- may 
actually contain compounds that increase potentially harmful cholesterol 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery runs counter to popularly held beliefs that margarine is a more 
healthful alternative to butter because of its lower cholesterol profile. 
</P>
<P>
The study further confuses an already bewildered public about the role of 
cholesterol and fat in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying, 'What are we supposed to do? And what are we to believe?"' 
said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute in 
Washington. "The credibility of the nutrition community has really been shaken 
by this." 
</P>
<P>
The report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, stated that trans 
monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily found in margarines and shortenings, 
increased low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs, by 6% in a three-week dietary 
study of 59 adults. 
</P>
<P>
Trans fatty acids are formed when vegetable oil is hydrogenated, or solidified, 
to create margarine. Elevated LDL levels in blood have been linked to heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with consumer advocates, food industry representatives and health 
researchers in the past week revealed a general dietary consensus: moderation. 
In other words, individuals at risk for heart disease should reduce their 
intake of all fats including butter, margarine and oils. Those without a 
cholesterol problem should continue to monitor fat intake but may still enjoy 
reasonable amounts of butter or margarine. 
</P>
<P>
"No responsible person is saying substitute butter for margarine," said Bonnie 
Liebman, nutrition director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 
a Washington-based advocacy group. "It simply is too early to jump to that 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives, representing both margarine or butter interests, 
downplayed the importance of the study, saying excessive amounts of trans fatty 
acids were fed to subjects and thus produced "unusual" results. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers, Ronald P. Mensink, Ph.D., and Martijn B. Katan, Ph.D., 
conducted the project at the Agricultural University in Wageningen, the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings also showed that trans fatty acids may even reduce the presence 
of beneficial high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs, which act to purge the blood 
stream of harmful compounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch researchers' work demonstrated that the increases in cholesterol 
levels caused by trans fatty acids parallel those detected in subjects fed 
diets heavy in saturated fats. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that LDL levels increased 12% among participants fed a 
saturated fat diet during the project. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, it would seem prudent for patients at increased risk of 
atherosclerosis to avoid a high intake of trans fatty acids," the researchers 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the dairy industry should be celebrating news that margarine's 
ingredients may raise cholesterol levels, therefore better positioning butter 
in the nutrition world. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a renaissance for butter. No, it would not be fair to the public 
to say that," said Sharon Long, director of communications for the Dairy 
Council of California, a nutrition education organization in Sacramento. "We 
never thought that margarine was sacred or oil was sacred or butter was sacred. 
All fats should be moderated in the diet." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Mensink and Katan study have also surfaced in the days since the 
report was published. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cause for alarm," said David Kritchevsky, associate director of 
the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. "Generally speaking, the amount they fed 
the subjects was four times the average American intake (of trans fatty acids), 
so you would expect to see an increase in LDL. If they had fed the people 
normal amounts, then nothing would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis-based American Soybean Assn. also took issue with the types of 
food served in the Dutch study. (About 75% of all margarine produced in this 
country is made from soybean oil.) 
</P>
<P>
"The (meals) were completely inconsistent with what Americans eat," said Gunnar 
Lynum, the association's marketing vice president. "Even so, the changes they 
recorded are not that great. (The trans fatty acid) did increase cholesterol 
levels, but not by as much as when the subjects were fed saturated fat . . . . 
I don't think this is a setback for margarine." 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the National Assn. of Margarine Manufactures in Washington 
reported no sales declines among members in the well-publicized study's 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cristol, the association's executive director, said the margarine-like 
food used in the Dutch study was chemically different than the product sold in 
this country. He emphasized that butter still contains more saturated fat, a 
known dietary evil, than does margarine. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two grams of saturated fat in (a tablespoon of) margarine; even less 
in vegetable oil spreads," he said. "There are seven grams of saturated fat in 
(a similar serving of) butter. . . . Margarine remains a healthful alternative 
to butter." 
</P>
<P>
The study does present an interesting dilemma for the fast food industry. Many 
chains recently announced that they would fry foods, particularly French fries, 
in vegetable oils rather than beef fat. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, of the Community Nutrition Institute, said that the change may 
actually increase the amount of fat present on these foods. 
</P>
<P>
Potatoes are more likely to absorb the vegetable fat, and its trans fatty 
acids, than animal fat, which had previously been used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Science's Liebman said it was too soon to know whether trans 
fatty acids pose a problem with fast foods. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the exact composition of the oils used in frying (by the 
chains). You can't assume that all hydrogenated oils are worse than beef fat," 
she said.

DISABLED WORKER CLAIMS JOB BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: THE LAKEWOOD WOMAN, BORN WITHOUT ARMS AND LEGS, FILES 
DISCRIMINATION ALLEGATIONS OVER HER FIRING FROM A HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 40-year-old Lakewood woman born without arms and legs claims she was fired 
from a job as head social worker at a Long Beach hospital because 
administrators there objected to her turning pages with her lips. 
</P>
<P>
Diane DeVries, who earned a college degree with a pen pressed between the stump 
of her right arm and her face, filed a discrimination charge last week with the 
state Department of Fair Employment and Housing in Los Angeles in an effort to 
win back the $12-an-hour job at Long Beach Doctors Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a dirty sock they just threw aside," said DeVries, an affable 
woman who earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from UCLA in 1987, despite a 
congenital birth defect that left her with two small stumps for arms, and no 
legs. "I have lived a basically normal life. Most of my friends are not 
disabled. This brought to the surface the fact that I am different. That's just 
never happened before." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital Administrator Thomas V. Olson said he decided DeVries should not 
return to work at the 43-bed hospital because she was observed turning the 
pages of hospital documents with her mouth, a practice he and two other doctors 
considered a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an infection control situation. We can't permit that. We have 
standards here to protect our patients and our people," Olson said in a recent 
interview. "I feel sorry for the lady, but I just don't think that behavior 
could be allowed here. I was thinking not only of other people, but of her, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
DeVries' attorney, Larry Minsky, says she is capable of turning pages with the 
stump of her arm rather than her mouth, but the hospital never bothered to ask 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Minsky contends that the hospital violated a state law requiring that employers 
"reasonably accommodate" disabled workers to help them perform a job. 
</P>
<P>
"If the practice is found to be medically unacceptable, then the proper thing 
to do is to talk to her like a human being and say, 'Hey, is there another way 
of doing that?' " the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the job, DeVries says, she cannot pay the $550 rent on her apartment 
and faces commitment to a nursing home, a downward spiral from which disabled 
people do not easily recover, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in a nursing home you lose your Social Security benefits. You 
can't get a place to live without your Social Security benefits and you can't 
get your Social Security benefits without an address," she said. "It's a 
Catch-22." 
</P>
<P>
DeVries, who has been confined to a wheelchair since childhood, said there were 
few days in her life as memorable as Thursday, June 28, when she woke up to 
report to her first day on the hospital job as director of social services. She 
arranged for her personal attendant to help her shower and dress early enough 
to catch two buses and arrive at the hospital at 8:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since she left Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey -- 
18 years old and determined to be independent -- DeVries says her life had come 
together. She had a college degree, a one-bedroom apartment in Lakewood and a 
job counseling hospital patients not unlike herself. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I was going to lose that job was if I quit -- so I thought," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, on the Fourth of July, the hospital relayed a message that her 
services were no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only assume they don't wish to have people with handicaps in and around 
the facility, that they don't want people with the 'look' of Diane," said her 
Long Beach attorney, Minsky. "This is Neanderthal." 
</P>
<P>
Marta Fernandez, a Century City attorney representing the hospital, said no 
discrimination laws were violated because DeVries was officially employed by 
Associated Social Resources Inc., a Los Angeles firm that places social workers 
in hospitals. Long Beach Doctors Hospital had contracted with the firm to fill 
the position. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Olson said, the hospital had not agreed to take DeVries on 
permanently, but had brought her in to fill in for a vacationing social worker. 
That position has since been filled permanently, however, he said. 
</P>
<P>
DeVries insists that the position given to her was permanent, with the salary 
to begin at $12 and increase to $14 sometime afterward. She said janitors had 
even built up a desk so she would be able to write. 
</P>
<P>
DeVries, who previously worked as a counselor assisting disabled people for an 
agency in Paramount, said she has been unable to find work since she lost the 
hospital job. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez confirmed this week that she had received the discrimination charge 
filed by DeVries. 
</P>
<P>
Associated Social Resources, the placement firm, also was named in the claim, 
which said the agency complied with the hospital administrator's request that 
DeVries be removed from the job. The agency's director, Meryl Stern, refused to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing in Los Angeles 
said they are awaiting a response from the hospital and will then begin an 
investigation, which could take up to a year to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department will attempt to negotiate a settlement to the 
dispute. If that fails, Minsky said, a lawsuit will be filed.

THEY TWIST, TURN, ROLL AND JUMP BECAUSE THEY GET A KICK OUT OF EXERCISE. AND 
FOR CONTESTANTS VYING FOR THE TITLE OF KING AND QUEEN OF AEROBICS, IT'S A 
SCREAM.

<P>
Just when you thought disco was dead and the fitness craze had subsided, the 
two dark forces banded together in a feverish display that left dozens of 
people literally screaming in the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
They call it aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of the sport's true believers gathered at Loyola Marymount University in 
Westchester last weekend to show what 30 hours a week at the gym can do for the 
human body. Their mission: to boldly go where few aerobics enthusiasts have 
gone before -- a national championship to be held in Los Angeles Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was over, the two dozen male and female entrants showed the spirited 
crowd the difference between being a true aerobic ambassador and just another 
extremely fit person who looks swell in a leotard. 
</P>
<P>
It's the smile. 
</P>
<P>
As contestant after contestant proved during the competition, featuring some of 
Southern California's top aerobics instructors, many people may be able to 
flex, roll, twist and shout, but only the real masters can do it with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
They smile when they kick their feet over their heads. They smile when they 
somersault. They smile when they do sit-ups. They smile when they do push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bell and Steve Morse, winners of the mixed pairs division, were nearly 
laughing when they performed their push-ups -- on top on one another. 
</P>
<P>
Women's finalist Penny Waid explained part of this aerobic secret. 
</P>
<P>
"I smile when I'm nervous," she said. "And I'm nervous because I only had three 
weeks to come up with my routine. I'm just happy that I finished." 
</P>
<P>
There were happy faces all around Saturday. The enthusiasm the competitors 
exhibited was matched only by the loudness of the music (predominantly disco 
and dance mix) and the screeching of the crowd (predominantly in Danskins and 
tank tops). Every pectoral flex was greeted by a "yeeooowww," every arm pump 
triggering a wave of "yeeeaaahhs." 
</P>
<P>
About the only unsmiling face belonged to one women contestant who thought she 
had been unfairly slighted by the panel of judges. She complained before 
leaving in a huff with her equally unhappy family. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people really get into it seriously," explained finalist Maureen 
McMillan. "But that's why they are so good. They become obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
McMillan is a living testament to what happens to a human body after it has 
been gripped by the aerobic spirit. Fat may occasionally find a way into her 
diet, but definitely not onto her body. She performed her four required 
push-ups with one arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do that a year ago, but I wanted to show the people that I was 
strong," she said. "I've been practicing to do that since May." 
</P>
<P>
It was not quite enough. McMillan and the other women finalists were edged out 
by Evelyn Householder. Tim Green took the men's crown. 
</P>
<P>
While aerobics may not be a true mass-spectator sport, such as football and 
baseball, what it lacks in crowd size it makes up for in sponsorship. The 
Westchester event was put on by Sundance Natural Juice Sparkler and the 
Aerobics and Fitness Assn. of America. And makers of fitness apparel, sports 
equipment and several travel agencies and health clubs were on hand to hawk 
their wares in the name of aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Southern California "Sundance Aerobics and Fitness Challenge," 
similar contests were held in New York, Boston, Chicago, Dallas and San 
Francisco. The winners of the regional events will compete in the national 
final next month at the Los Angeles Airport Hilton. So far, the fitness 
face-offs have raised about $10,000 for the March of Dimes Campaign for 
Healthier Babies. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, aerobics fever is spreading. The national winners will be eligible to 
compete in an international competition next year in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But Waid wasn't thinking about that. She was trying to remember the routine for 
her final two-minute workout before the judges. She was nervous. She was 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't help it," she said. 
</P>

GOALS PLANNED FOR SCHOOLS THROUGH 2000; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A RETREAT BY GLENDALE EDUCATORS AND PARENTS PRODUCES A BROAD 
FRAMEWORK FOR INNOVATIVE CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A planning retreat last week by Glendale teachers, parents and school 
administrators outlined broad goals for local education through the year 2000, 
completing the next step in a plan to change the way Glendale schools are run, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day retreat, which ended Saturday, was part of "Glendale Schools 
2000," a year of strategic planning that administrators expect will bring about 
innovative changes during the next decade and give more decision-making 
authority and flexibility to teachers and school sites. 
</P>
<P>
District officials conceded that the results of the retreat were largely 
abstract: The 30 participants developed a "mission statement," 15 strategies 
for accomplishing the mission and a wish-list of objectives, such as "All 
students in the Glendale Unified School District will achieve at their optimal 
potential each day." 
</P>
<P>
The district's mission, according to participants, "is to ensure that all 
students acquire the character and capability to excel in the endeavors of 
their choice, through our multicultural, technological, performance-paced, 
self-directed network, that fully integrates all school, family and community 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
The strategies were developed into statements such as "We will integrate 
community resources into the instructional programs" and "We will guarantee 
that the special needs of all students are met in order to guarantee access to 
all aspects of the curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said such statements are meant to guide the district as it develops 
more specific plans for its schools. The statements also are expected to 
provide themes for individual schools as they eventually are allowed more say 
in how they are run. 
</P>
<P>
"They are rather broad, but there are things here that really chart a direction 
as to what we should do," said Don Empey, the district's assistant 
superintendent of instruction. "Now that we have a framework for planning, it 
will get very specific from here on in." 
</P>
<P>
The retreat, held at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona at a 
cost of about $6,000, was led by Bill Cook of the Cambridge Management Group, 
an Alabama-based planning and consulting business, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district is paying Cook about $20,000 to conduct strategic planning through 
April. The process began in May, when nearly 250 administrators, teachers, 
parents, students and community and City Hall leaders met for two days to 
brainstorm and discuss schools' priorities for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty of those participants volunteered to attend the retreat. District 
officials will attempt by October to recruit up to 300 people to serve on 15 
"action teams," which will work on specific plans for each strategy developed 
by the task force, Empey said. Those plans will include estimates of how much 
money and time each strategy might take, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The teams are expected to report in February to the 30-member task force, which 
in turn will present a comprehensive plan in April to the Board of Education, 
Empey said. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Glendale's 27 schools, keeping the district's general strategies in 
mind, will then develop its own specific plans. Administrators have compared 
that step to school-based management, a process now under way in some Los 
Angeles schools that allows teachers, parents and administrators at individual 
school sites more say in how their schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
"How school 'A' designs its strategies and action plans . . . may differ from 
how school 'B' does it, but the intent will be for both schools to fulfill the 
mission of the district," Supt. Robert Sanchis said. "This creates latitude and 
flexibility" in planning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The process might not be easy. Abstract goals were set by the district in the 
early 1970s, but Glendale schools -- and their needs -- have changed. The 
district is now ethnically diverse, with about 66% of its students coming from 
Middle Eastern and nonwhite backgrounds. The Board of Education has approved 
year-round education, to begin in certain schools in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Because of an influx of immigrants and a development boom in Glendale, student 
enrollment and its effects have been difficult to predict. So has the 
availability of state money, which administrators said will be necessary for 
some of the changes that will be proposed. 
</P>
<P>
But participants in last week's retreat said they were confident that strategic 
planning can withstand those challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"This starts to set us in a new direction," said Brent Noyes, a teacher at 
Lincoln Elementary School and a former president of the Glendale Teachers Assn. 
"It gives us a framework and a blueprint for the future."

FALSE ALARMS TO COST REAL MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale residents who repeatedly trip their burglar alarms by accident take 
note: That police officer who rolls up to your front door in response may cost 
you 62 cents a minute. If a police helicopter is summoned, it may cost you 
$3.57 for every 60 seconds the pilot hovers overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties, approved Tuesday by the Glendale City Council, are aimed at 
encouraging residents to repair faulty alarm systems and be more careful about 
accidental activations. They will also help cover police costs related to 
answering repeated false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
The clock-watching fees may sound amusing -- a police lieutenant is worth 12 
cents a minute more than a sergeant, for example -- but city officials say the 
diversion of officers to calls where no break-in has occurred is no laughing 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the council, Police Chief David J. Thompson said his 
department responded to 6,022 false alarms in 1988 and 6,181 last year. He said 
these calls "represent a great drain upon already strapped police manpower and 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
The city allows two false alarms annually at no charge. Last month, the council 
increased the fines from a maximum of $35 to $100 for five or more in a year. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council approved a new "special assignment assessment" to be 
imposed in addition to the $100 fine for false alarms in excess of four in a 
single year. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which will take effect Sept. 20, states that the assessment will 
be computed at a "cost-per-minute rate," specifying different charges according 
to the rank and assignment of the officer who responds. The top fee is $3.72 
per minute for a police sergeant who also is the helicopter pilot. Police said 
responding to a false alarm typically takes 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
During their first review last week, council members endorsed the new fee but 
balked at an accompanying police proposal to limit residents and businesses to 
one false alarm per year. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think we ought to give them a couple of shots a year, then charge for 
it," said Councilman Jerold Milner, whose motion to retain the two free 
responses annually was approved. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian cast the only opposing vote, saying a single free call would 
be a better deterrent. "We're wasting police officers' time in responding to 
false alarms," he said.

3 UNRELATED WEEKEND SLAYINGS ARE BLAMED ON GANG MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Three men were killed in what police suspect were unconnected gang-related 
shootings last weekend in northeast Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a man whom police identified as a gang member was fatally shot in a 
drive-by shooting outside a party, police said. On Sunday, a former gang member 
was shot to death on the street a few blocks from his home, said Los Angeles 
Police Detective Ron Whitt. 
</P>
<P>
And late Saturday, a Cypress Park man who police said was not a gang member, 
was killed after trying to stop an automobile break-in outside his home. 
Witnesses told police they saw gang members running from the area where he was 
shot, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Luevano, 19, was shot shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday after he and two 
cousins drove up to his house along the 700 block of Isabel Street and saw a 
man trying to break into his cousin's car, said Detective Loren Zimmerman. 
Luevano jumped out and confronted the man and the two started fighting, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Luevano's cousin Saul Jimenez jumped out of the car to help, but the auto 
break-in suspect bit Jimenez's hand, Zimmerman said. Luevano and the suspect 
ran down a narrow, curved hillside street. 
</P>
<P>
Luevano's cousins told police that several men, who witnesses believe were gang 
members, were seen running up from the hillside street area. The men beat up 
Luevano's other cousin, Victor Jimenez, then fled, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, who had heard a shot fired, called police. Luevano was found lying 
in front of a house on Isabel Street, shot once in the back, Zimmerman said. He 
was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where he died at 11:37 p.m. Saturday, 
said hospital spokeswoman Adelaida DeLaCerda. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects in the shooting, Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Friday shooting, an 18-year-old Central Los Angeles man was killed when 
shots were fired from a car carrying three men believed by police to be gang 
members. As the vehicle drove past a Highland Park apartment complex shortly 
after 11 p.m. shots were fired into a crowd of 50 party-goers gathered on the 
front lawn, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Pantoja, 18, who police said was a gang member, was shot as he was 
leaving the party on the 900 block of Milwaukee Avenue. Pantoja was taken to 
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, where he was pronounced dead at 12:06 
a.m. Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police suspect that members of a rival gang shot into the crowd, but there are 
no suspects, Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a former gang member was gunned down shortly before 1 a.m. while 
walking down a street several blocks from his Atwater Village home, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Anthony Velazquez, 20, was shot six times with a .22-caliber gun along 
the 3200 block of Drew Street, police said. Velazquez had been walking with two 
women when a man jumped out of a passing car, argued with him and fired shots, 
Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The women fled as the man approached. Witnesses told police there were three 
other men in the car. Investigators have identified suspects but have not made 
any arrests, said Detective Jose Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 10 gang-related shooting, police have issued a warrant for the 
arrest of a Glassell Park man who they say fired the shots that killed a rival 
gang member at the Triangle Motel on Eagle Rock Boulevard, Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Pelayo, 18, has been charged with murder in the shooting of 20-year-old 
Rafael Sanchez of the Rampart area, but he is still at large, Zimmerman said.

RECYCLING IS GAINING POPULARITY; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE DISPOSAL: INCREASED PUBLIC AWARENESS, LARGER REFUNDS AND EXPANDED 
CURBSIDE PICKUP HAVE HELPED MAKE RECYCLING 'A NONSTOP INDUSTRY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Five years ago, recycling trash was hailed as an idea whose time had come. 
</P>
<P>
Today, environmentalists, sanitary engineers, politicians, business managers 
and homeowners agree that recycling is here to stay -- a trend riding on an 
ever-rising crest of public awareness and participation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been recycling ever since the Bronze Age," said Mark Ringelberg, a 
spokesman for Westside Recycling of Glendale, a veteran trash management firm. 
"Now, its a nonstop industry." 
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, recycling appears to have caught on in the foothill 
communities of Glendale and northeast Los Angeles, Ringelberg and others said. 
</P>
<P>
Business at Westside Recycling has doubled, said Ringelberg -- twice the 
statewide increase in the volume of recycled beverage containers. 
</P>
<P>
The first fiscal year of a city-sponsored curbside recycling program in 
Glendale ended in June with more than double the amount of contributions 
expected in the most conservative projections. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot recycling program in neighborhoods of northeast Los Angeles will be 
greatly expanded starting next month because of the success of the program 
there, Los Angeles officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Even big business has hopped on the bandwagon. "Everywhere we go, we get 
stampeded by people wanting to assist" in company recycling programs, said Kym 
Murphy, corporate vice president of environmental policy for the Walt Disney 
Co. of Burbank, which has 50,000 employees nationwide. "We're just getting 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Eyeing a steady stream of drivers pulling to the curb of Westside Recycling to 
drop off bags of reusable cans, glass, plastic bottles and newspapers, 
Ringelberg said business has never been better. "We get movie stars to street 
people and everyone in between," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase is partly attributed to a state law that went into effect in 
January, boosting the refund value of recyclable bottles and cans from a penny 
per container to a nickel for two containers. The public conscience also has 
been tweaked by a $4-million statewide campaign and widespread media focus in 
April on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a crisis going on in the state with the number of landfills slated to 
close by the end of the century," said Ralph Chandler, who oversees recycling 
operations for the state Department of Conservation. He has called for "an 
aggressive stand" to divert the amount of trash and to extend the life of 
existing landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said Glendale is a leader in taking that stand. The city has 
launched one of the most aggressive programs for curbside recycling in the 
state and has pressured neighboring foothill communities to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 tons of trash were diverted from Glendale's sole landfill -- 
Scholl Canyon -- in the past year because of a citywide curbside recycling 
program, said Steve Zurn, a city administrative analyst. That's more than twice 
the figure projected by city and county engineers before the program began in 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At Glendale's request, neighboring communities such as La Crescenta, Montrose 
and Pasadena also have started curbside recycling programs to reduce the amount 
of refuse dumped at Scholl Canyon in an effort to extend the life of the 
landfill. Results have not yet been tabulated, Zurn said. 
</P>
<P>
Scholl Canyon in April became the first landfill in the state authorized to use 
"green waste" -- grass clippings and other landscape materials -- to cover 
layers of trash at the city's landfill, Zurn said. The compost will speed 
decomposition of trash in the landfill and compact the amount of space required 
for disposal of landscaping materials -- the most voluminous residential waste. 
</P>
<P>
In northeast Los Angeles, a city-sponsored recycling program started a year ago 
for 15,000 families will soon be expanded to another 24,000 homes in Los Feliz, 
Atwater, Silver Lake, Glassell Park, Echo Park, Highland Park, Mt. Washington 
and other areas, said Angela Franklin of the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the residents in those areas participated in a pilot program for 
the past year, she said, contrasted with about 50% citywide. Participation in 
city-sponsored curbside recycling on the Westside was about 60%, Franklin said, 
while participation in a pilot program in the San Fernando Valley was 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Zurn said 40% of single-family residents in Glendale are now participating in 
the curbside recycling program -- double the amount originally anticipated. The 
city is the first in the state to expand the program not only to single-family 
homes, but to apartment and condominium residents, Zurn said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents at two-, three- and four-unit apartments can now recycle trash, as 
well as those at 136 buildings in the city with five or more units, Zurn said. 
The city's goal is to extend recycling soon to all of the 1,813 multifamily 
buildings in the city, Zurn said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in state refunds for containers turned into recycling 
centers, Glendale officials said participation in the curbside program is 
increasing. "We're using aggressive marketing to bring more public awareness to 
the program," Zurn said. 
</P>
<P>
Public awareness is also noticeable at the Westside Recycling center at 6449 
San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a steady stream of cars pulled up, with drivers dropping off their 
recyclable cans, bottles, plastic containers and newspapers. Most patrons are 
regulars, said company spokesman Ringelberg, and are given "gold cards" that 
help speed payment for their deposits and provide a small monetary bonus for 
their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Mockler, 4, of Glendale is in charge of his family's conservation efforts. 
He carefully saved soda cans and bottles for a month in a bag in a closet for 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Joan Mockler, said Owen and his sister Whitney, 2, have learned 
since they moved to California just a few months ago that rapidly depleting 
landfills present a crisis. Owen said he will add the $1.90 he earned from his 
enterprise to his savings account for a college education.

Andy Jeffery, a janitor at Walt Disney Imagineering in Glendale, brought in 70 
pounds of beverage containers on his regular weekly trek to the recycling 
center Monday. He said Disney workers are eager to contribute to recycling 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Vega of Glendale had a simple reason for bringing containers to the 
center. She said she is out of work and uses the money she gets for depositing 
reuseable containers to buy gas for her automobile.

"My friends told me about recycling," she said. "They help me pick up trash in 
the neighborhood."

PLAN TO BUY LAND DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-million to $2-million price tag has forced the City Council to drop its 
plan of buying land intended for a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
The council had wanted a parking lot instead of a mall on the site at 5919 Oak 
Ave. At its July 31 meeting, after learning the property owner had obtained all 
permits and was beginning construction, the council decided to offer to buy the 
land, or perhaps force a sale through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
However, after an executive session Tuesday, the council announced it was 
unwilling to spend that much money.

DRIVE FOR TOWN HALL GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A financial drive to convert the Hawkins House into a town hall has reached 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
An official from Nottingham Ltd., the firm that plans to develop the house's 
site, at the corner of Lake and Sacramento avenues, gave $20,000 last week to 
the Altadena Town Hall committee. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $300,000 is needed to relocate and renovate the 99-year-old 
Victorian home. Community leaders have two months to raise the additional 
$200,000 before the house's site is cleared. 
</P>
<P>
The committee plans to move the 6,000-square-foot house, built in 1891 by Los 
Angeles grocer G. D. Rowan, to a site on El Molino Avenue between the county 
sheriff's and fire stations. It would house community meeting rooms, a museum, 
a theater and a meeting place for the Town Council.

TEST RUNS TO BEGIN ON LONG BEACH BLUE LINE LOOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Test runs will begin Sunday for the Metro Rail loop into downtown Long Beach in 
preparation for the opening of the last leg of the Blue Line track that will 
complete a 22-mile link to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The trains will run every 10 minutes through the week, and transit officials 
are cautioning drivers and pedestrians to take extra care traveling along Long 
Beach Boulevard, Pacific Avenue and 1st and 8th streets. 
</P>
<P>
New left turn signals have been installed at intersections along the loop, but 
drivers are being warned not to stop on the tracks while waiting to turn "even 
if you don't see a train coming," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach loop opens Sept. 1, and will serve four stations located at 5th 
Street and Long Beach Boulevard, 1st Street and Long Beach Boulevard, 1st 
Street and Pine Avenue in the Transit Mall, and 5th Street and Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
More than 19 miles of the Blue Line track have been up and running since July, 
but the line stopped at the Anaheim Street station on Long Beach Boulevard 
while construction on the downtown loop was completed. 
</P>
<P>
At the north end of the Blue Line, one additional station remains under 
construction at 7th and Flower streets in downtown Los Angeles. Scheduled to 
open next year, it eventually will provide easy transfer to the Metro Rail Red 
Line, which also is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Free rides were offered for the first two weeks of service after the Blue Line 
opened July 14, with nearly 670,000 boardings during that initial period, 
according to Nick Patsaouras, president of the Southern California Rapid 
Transit District board. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the end of the free-fare period, we have been averaging 15,000 riders a 
day," Patsaouras said. "On Sundays, we are carrying nearly 20,000 riders. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe these are significant numbers, especially for a new system where 
five of the stations still are to be opened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras said it took only 40 days to reach the milestone of the millionth 
passenger, and that the system is six months ahead of original projections in 
ridership.

MAN FACES WEAPONS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal charges have been filed against an 18-year-old man arrested for 
carrying a billy club during a riot outside a Westwood theater Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Lyle Bailey, who lives in the Fairfax District, was arrested at 1:35 a.m. 
Aug. 4 outside a theater at Westwood Boulevard and Broxton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He was charged with possession of an illegal weapon and possession of a deadly 
weapon with intent to commit an assault, according to the city attorney's 
office, which filed the charges. If convicted, Bailey faces a possible 18 
months in jail and $2,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
It took police several hours to quell the disturbance, which authorities said 
apparently erupted after a showing of the Spike Lee movie "Mo' Better Blues." 
As officers were gaining control of the crowd, they spotted 11 men, including 
Bailey, emerging from a nearby alley, officials said. Bailey had the club 
concealed under the bib of his overalls, said City Atty. James Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey is to be arraigned Aug. 29 in West Los Angeles Municipal Court.

WOMEN SOUGHT FOR STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers at the UCLA School of Medicine are seeking women, ages 45 to 64, 
who are in good health and have had a natural or surgical menopause to 
volunteer for a national health study. 
</P>
<P>
The school is seeking 75 women for a three-year investigation of hormone 
replacement therapy and its role in preventing heart disease and other health 
problems, including osteoporosis, in post-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
"Since heart disease is the No. 1 killer of post-menopausal women, this is an 
extremely important study," UCLA's Howard Judd said. "We don't fully understand 
all the factors involved in the development of heart disease in women. However, 
hormonal factors do play a role in preventing heart disease, and we hope to 
gain valuable knowledge about the nature and importance of this role." 
</P>
<P>
Judd is a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA and principal 
investigator of the study. 
</P>
<P>
The study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, is the first 
national study to focus on women, who have been under-represented in most 
previous research on heart disease and many other major health problems. UCLA 
is one of seven participating institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Women who participate will receive free blood tests, mammography, bone density 
studies, electrocardiograms and relevant medication throughout the study. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call the UCLA Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at 
(213) 825-9502.

COUNCIL WEIGHS PICKUP FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether the city will accept a new, costlier, contract with Riverside-based 
National Environmental Waste Co. for pickup and disposal of the city's refuse 
won't be decided until November. 
</P>
<P>
The company has asked for a 19% increase in rates, which range from $7.35 a 
month for collection of one curbside garbage can to as much as $220 a 
collection for large dumpsters on ranches of up to 20 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided to extend a decision to allow time for members Audrey 
Chamberlain and Thomas Melbourn to accompany the collection vehicles on a 
pickup day in the city. Chamberlain and Melbourn will report back to the 
council, and members will attend a workshop with representatives of NEWCO. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the streets and roads of Bradbury, a two-square-mile city with many 
ranches and stables tucked into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, are 
narrow and winding. The disposal company contends that its vehicles encounter 
unusual logistical problems in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The contract includes collection of garbage and manure.

City limits on new apartment and condominium construction will continue until 
next year, but will be less restrictive, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to extend the moratorium, passed last month, until July 17, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The modified moratorium, which applies to multiunit residential zones, 
eliminates an earlier requirement that second stories be set back further from 
the street than first stories; increases the permitted square footage of second 
stories from 75% of the first story to 85%, and reduces the minimum amount of 
landscaping from 800 square feet per dwelling unit to 500 square feet per unit. 
</P>

Meanwhile, city staff members are preparing to recommend a permanent code 
change.

KOSHER SHOP CLOSES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emes Kosher Meat Market, a once-popular establishment that lost its kosher 
certificate and closed its doors in May, then reopened under the supervision of 
a controversial rabbi, has gone out of business again. 
</P>
<P>
In an advertisement in a Jewish weekly, owner Semyon Rachshtut wrote: "To all 
our friends and customers: We are sorry to inform you that Emes Kosher Meat 
Market is closing down due to the suppression received from the Rabbinical 
Council of California." 
</P>
<P>
Open for three weeks under the supervision of an independent rabbi, I. Harold 
Sharfman, Emes was crippled by an informal boycott by Orthodox Jews, whose 
rabbis advised them against patronizing the establishment on South La Cienega 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The RCC cannot recommend Emes Meats, even with other supervision," the 
Rabbinical Council declared in an advertisement of its own, saying that its 
endorsement was "permanently removed." 
</P>
<P>
Sharfman then withdrew his independent certification, saying it had been issued 
only pending reconsideration by the RCC. 
</P>
<P>
An inspector for the Rabbinical Council is alleged to have found evidence that 
non-kosher meat was sold at the store.

COUNCIL SPLITS ON HOW TO FILL STACH'S UNEXPIRED TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a special meeting Tuesday, the Artesia City Council failed to resolve 
how it will replace former Councilman Rod Stach. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Jim Van Horn and Ronald Oliver favored appointing a successor, while 
Mayor Robert Jamison and Councilwoman Mary Alyce Soares preferred holding an 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Both Van Horn and Oliver submitted the names of possible appointees: former 
Mayor Dennis Fellows; Planning Commission member Douglas Padelford; Bob 
Thornton, an unsuccessful council candidate in the April election; and Glenn 
Hutchinson, a retired sheriff's deputy. The council voted on each nomination 
but deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
The issue will be discussed again at the council's regular meeting Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Stach resigned recently to accept a job promotion in Salt Lake City. His 
elected term runs through April, 1992.

$5,000 REWARD SET FOR HELP IN GANG SHOOTING FATALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norwalk is offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who provides information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the suspected gang members who killed an 
Artesia youth during a shooting at a graduation party in June. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus E. Diaz, 16, a reputed gang member, was shot to death on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other youths were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert J. Arthur also proposed that the city initiate a general 
reward program with fixed amounts, such as a $250 reward for information 
leading to the arrest of people who mark the city with graffiti. The council 
would establish a reward fund and seek contributions from businesses and 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Safety Commission and public safety director will meet to set up 
guidelines for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the City Council offered a $5,000 reward after Juan Enriquez, a 
17-year-old honor student at John Glenn High School, was killed in a drive-by 
shooting as he walked home from school. No one has been arrested for the 
shooting, and the reward was never paid. 
</P>
<P>
City officials ask that anyone with information on the shootings call 863-4344.

<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for an opportunity to do a little biking, hiking or winery touring? The 
Ventura Department of Parks and Recreation has scheduled a few activities that 
may be the ticket for an enjoyable weekend. 
</P>
<P>
If mountains and colorful sunsets sound intriguing, you might be interested in 
the "sunset, wine and cheese hike," 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The hike will take place in the Santa Monica Mountains. An experienced guide 
will lead the easy-to-moderate hiking excursion. An $18 fee includes wine and 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Space is available for wine-tasting enthusiasts to tour some of the Santa Ynez 
Valley wineries -- large and small -- 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. A $20 fee 
includes transportation, tours, tasting and a souvenir wineglass. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclists -- novices and veterans alike -- can enjoy a mountain bike excursion 
into Santa Barbara's Red Rock area, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday. Tour guide Tim 
Harris will lead the group and explain maintenance and riding tips along the 
way. Participants are encouraged to bring snacks and beverages for a picnic 
lunch at Gibraltar Reservoir. Cyclists must wear a helmet during the ride. The 
cost is $15.

BEST BETS: PHOTOS RECAPTURE 'GRAPES OF WRATH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horace Bristol's photographs of poor itinerant farmers during the California 
Dust Bowl years are as poignant as "The Grapes of Wrath," the John Steinbeck 
novel inspired by the same scenes Bristol recorded on film. 
</P>
<P>
They can be seen with other Bristol photos at the Ojai Arts Center Gallery, 
where black and white works of the 82-year-old Ojai resident are on display 
through the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol's photo essays include ones taken during World War II in Japan, Korea 
and North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But some of his most important work was shot here in California, capturing the 
plight of the people who lost everything during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol traveled through Northern California with author John Steinbeck and 
made a photo record of families fighting for survival during the dust bowl 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The story is a fictionalized account of "the actual people that we came in 
contact with," Bristol said. "Steinbeck grew fond of my prints and he wrote 
about the real people in them." 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Grapes of Wrath' is something that every generation must be reminded 
of," he said, "and I hope this helps." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is located at 113 S. Montgomery St., Ojai. For information, call 
646-0117.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: WHATEVER A CUSTOMER ASKS HIM TO MAKE, HE REPLIES: 'NO 
PROBLEM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
Nedelko (Nick) Delchev's problem may be that he's the kind of guy who can 
explain his invention to 1,000 people and 999 will break into a silly grin. 
</P>
<P>
He's not trying to be funny. It may be the curled mustache and the gray-haired 
barrel chest popping out of the neatly tucked shirt. The truncated English 
doesn't help. But it's mostly the deadpan candor with which he praises America 
for affording him the freedom to do what he has done. 
</P>
<P>
Delchev lost patience with the stifling ways of Communist Bulgaria in 1960 and 
took a run at the Iron Curtain. The 19-year-old auto mechanic raced across the 
shoot-without-warning zone and smacked into a barbed-wire fence rigged with 
bells and cans. Luckily it was Lubiemez (population 2,500) and not East Berlin. 
The guard was changing at the moment and didn't catch on. 
</P>
<P>
Delchev's next bout of willfulness came in 1973. By then, he was an American 
and thought that he would never have to stand in line again. He took it as a 
personal affront when the first gas shortage brought nasty queues to his 
adopted land. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too much like the old country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He began tinkering with an idea for an alternative fuel. Unlike the many who 
were out for the quick fix and tired of the endeavor as soon as the crisis 
subsided, Delchev never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 17 years later, with a new gas crisis at hand, he thinks that the world 
may be ready to take a serious look at what he's been doing. 
</P>
<P>
He gives demonstrations at his laboratory in Glendale's industrial district of 
West Palmer Avenue. He rents space from B. C. Radiator, a hissing, clanking 
place where the air is thick with the caustic steam that rises from vats of hot 
liquid. In a corner in the back, behind floor-to-ceiling stacks of crated 
radiators, Delchev has a lathe, a drill press, a workbench and a desk. Hung on 
the walls are a chart of the periodic table and half a dozen posters of 
bare-breasted women. 
</P>
<P>
There, to support inventing, Delchev does machine-shop work. He calls his 
business the No Problem Co. Whatever a customer asks him to make, he replies: 
"No problem." 
</P>
<P>
That, too, is the philosophy of his engine, which runs on household products 
and makes no pollution. The model is an arrangement of steel canisters, tubes, 
dials and switches jury-rigged on a cart. Its heart is an eight-inch-wide 
stainless-steel turbine from the starter motor for a jet engine. Delchev bought 
it from a scrap yard. 
</P>
<P>
This dynamo runs on a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sugar, with a dab of 
alcohol. The theory of combustion goes as follows: When sprayed through a 
nozzle over a catalyst of manganese dioxide, the hydrogen peroxide decomposes 
into water and oxygen, releasing heat. The oxygen burns the sugar, turning the 
water into steam, which turns the turbine at 18,000 r.p.m. Burning no air at 
all, the process releases no oxides of nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
That much is solid chemistry, said UCLA professor emeritus William Van Vorst, 
whose specialty is alternative fuels. The question is how to harness the 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Delchev's demonstration comes in. First, he wheels the engine 
outside, past young men in coveralls who continue their work as if not 
noticing. He attaches a car battery to an ignition device called a glow plug in 
a dark iron cylinder where combustion occurs. 
</P>
<P>
He turns a fuel valve. The casing around the turbine hisses and steam puffs 
out. 
</P>
<P>
He grins. 
</P>
<P>
"Hydrogen peroxide is decomposing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He coaxes the valve forward several times, progressing through louder hisses 
and larger blasts of steam. 
</P>
<P>
When the heat gauge reads 700 degrees, he disconnects the glow plug. The 
reaction is going on its own. 
</P>
<P>
At 1,000 degrees, the turbine starts and stops. At 1,200, there is a steady, 
searing scream and the turbine spins steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Delchev opens the valve further. A low hum rises from a gearbox, which is 
reducing the drive by a 22-to-1 ratio. The hum grows higher and louder. At 
1,400 degrees, the turbine is a blur. The howl of the gearbox reaches a 
head-splitting harmony with the hiss of the steam. An electric motor the size 
of a basketball is turning at a nifty 800 r.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Over the noise, Delchev says he's a single man, by necessity. "If I had been 
married, forget it," he yells. "I would have been divorced several times or 
beaten with a frying pan." 
</P>
<P>
The engine is Delchev's baby and, he says, it's strong enough to drive a car. 
His next step is to prove it. He's going to put one in a car and drive it. 
</P>
<P>
Many engineering hurdles lie ahead. Delchev has to develop systems for pumping 
the fuel and warming up the combustion chamber in less than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, he's got to stifle the noise. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, he'd like a large company to take over the execution, with a 
team for each system. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit and the U. S. Department of Defense have both looked at Delchev's 
device and said, "No, thanks." 
</P>
<P>
But Intertox America, a company that makes hydrogen peroxide, advised him to 
keep at it and stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
So the next time you see a car that sounds like a Southern Pacific locomotive, 
you'll know that inside is a man who is saying "Thank you" to America. 
</P>
<P>
And don't laugh. He has a patent.

Now at a theater near you: 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 in a series of reviews of Ventura County movie theaters. This time we 
take a look inside the Camarillo Cinemas at the Paseo Camarillo Shopping Center 
on Daily Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Food: The bad news about the hot dog is that it was rather bland. The good news 
is that it was so small that it hardly mattered how it tasted. 
</P>
<P>
The popcorn was good, with the butter carefully measured. 
</P>
<P>
Restroom: Interestingly, the men's room is painted white and brown, to match 
the look of the shopping center. The brown looks new, the white old and 
peeling, with scattered flecks of yellow gunk. It looked like a mid-quality gas 
station facility. One light fixture was broken, one toilet was out of order and 
the metal towel dispenser was bent as if someone, for some bizarre reason, had 
tried to break into it. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie entertainment: No music or Muzak, but there is a chorus of beeping 
from the four video games in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie ads: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Previews: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Movie screen: In theater No. 3, at least, the screen isn't deep enough. In the 
opening credits, the letters making up the stars' names dropped off the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicholson's film "The Two Jakes," the delayed sequel to "Chinatown," 
hasn't been that successful, but its presence has made the original a highly 
sought-after commodity in the local video market. "Everyone's coming in for 
it," said Ted Merrill of Video Adventures in Ojai, a store with only one copy 
of "Chinatown." "It's on reserve every night." 
</P>
<P>
New this week on the video shelves of Salzer's in Ventura: a four-set 
collection of tapes from the TV series "Outer Limits." That's right, no need to 
adjust your eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
The titles are "Controlled Experiment," starring Carroll O'Connor; "The Human 
Factor," with Sally Kellerman; "Behold Eck!" and "ZZZZZZ." 
</P>
<P>
Salzer's, by the way, is undergoing changes in management. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget the Ojai Film Society's science fiction night Aug. 26. This 
"Evening With the Incredible Shrinking Man" is being supported financially by 
the Diet Center. Talk about a sure-fire weight loss technique. LEO SMITH

ROBBERS HOLD 4 IN HOUSE FOR 8 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men wielding guns held four people captive in a La Crescenta house for 
nearly eight hours during a robbery, injected themselves and their victims with 
drugs and raped one of the women, Glendale police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen walked through the unlocked front door of Gregory Fallert's house in 
the 3700 block of Pontiac Street about 1:30 p.m. Monday, shortly after 
Fallert's mother, Betty Lane, and sister, Diane Racey, had arrived from 
Glendale for a visit, Sgt. Pete Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
The men bound all three while they ransacked the house, Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
Fallert's 25-year-old girlfriend arrived about 2 p.m., was taken to a bedroom 
and sexually assaulted by both men, Michael said. She later was tied and 
gagged. 
</P>
<P>
The victims told police that the men injected themselves with a hypodermic 
needle, then used it on Fallert and his girlfriend, who said they became 
drowsy, Michael said. Paramedics at the scene did not determine what was 
injected, but believe that it was a non-lethal dose of a narcotic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The men left in Fallert's car about 8 p.m. after taking several guns, a 
videocassette recorder, clothing and other items, police said. Lane was able to 
free herself because the shoelaces used to tie her had loosened. 
</P>
<P>
The victims described the robbers as a 35- to 40-year-old white with blond hair 
and tattoos and a Latino in his 30s. Fallert, 41, told police that he 
recognized the former as the person who broke into his house in May and stole 
his gun collection. Fallert identified one of the guns used Monday, a revolver, 
as his own, Michael said.

BUSINESSMAN JAILED OVER TAINTED SOIL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach businessman was jailed for two days this week after failing to 
obey a court order to clean up more than 50,000 tons of contaminated soil that 
he collected on a vacant lot in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bouchard was jailed Monday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John 
Zebrowski, who found that Bouchard and his company, Brent Petroleum, made 
inadequate progress on a March order to remove the soil piled at 1420 Coil Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The soil mounds have contributed to ozone air pollution because they contain 
petroleum and volatile organic compounds that were not enclosed or treated, 
permitting fumes to escape into the air, prosecutors from the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District said. 
</P>
<P>
"The L.A. Basin has one of the worst problems in the country with air quality," 
Zebrowski said Monday. "Here we have someone who doesn't seem to think that is 
very important." 
</P>
<P>
The sentence and an accompanying $1,000 fine against Brent Petroleum are just 
the latest legal setbacks for Bouchard and his company, which once faced a 
criminal investigation by the district attorney's office and still must contend 
with lawsuits by a former landlord and neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard also was still being held in County Jail Wednesday afternoon under a 
separate court order to report his financial status to a creditor who is trying 
to collect back rent. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard charged $55 a ton or more to stockpile soil, usually from companies 
cleaning up abandoned oil fields or removing underground gas tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard told the companies that he would use the soil to manufacture asphalt. 
But Brent Petroleum never obtained a permit to use the contaminated soil for 
asphalt and apparently had no intention of doing so, said Joseph Panasiti, a 
deputy prosecutor with the AQMD, because witnesses never saw such equipment 
operating at the Coil Avenue lot. 
</P>
<P>
In March, air district officials were granted the court order requiring cleanup 
of the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of two loads of soil that were removed. That's all," said Cindy 
Simovich, another AQMD prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's attorney told the judge during Monday's half-hour hearing that the 
businessman is in financial trouble and cannot afford the $450,000 it will cost 
to move the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Arlene Binder said Bouchard operated his business in good faith but 
ran out of money this year because he lost some clients and paid exorbitant 
legal fees to defend the myriad legal actions against him. 
</P>
<P>
But Zebrowski was unmoved and found Bouchard in contempt of the cleanup order. 
</P>
<P>
The judge questioned the claim that Bouchard could not afford the cleanup. "At 
$55 a ton and with 50,000 tons, we are talking about several million dollars," 
Zebrowski said. "We know there was a lot of money, and we don't know where that 
is. If the problem is not cleaned up, we are going to have more contempt 
proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's two-day jail sentence was extended when sheriff's officials found 
that a warrant had been issued for the businessman's arrest when he failed to 
produce information on his finances in another court case. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Superior Court Judge Richard F. Charvat ordered Tuesday that 
Bouchard remain jailed on $1,000 bail pending a hearing Friday in that case, in 
which Bouchard has been ordered to reveal his ability to pay a civil judgment 
he lost to C. Brewer Terminals Inc. of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the terminal company said Bouchard owes the Honolulu-based firm 
about $10,000 in back rent for a warehouse he leased in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's attorney in that case could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pressure remains on Bouchard to remove the soil from the Coil 
Avenue property. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the AQMD court order, the Japanese firm that leased one acre of land to 
Brent Petroleum on Coil Avenue has filed its own lawsuit to force Bouchard to 
clean up the property. 
</P>
<P>
Konoike Transport and Engineering USA Inc. alleges in its suit that Bouchard 
spread soil over the entire 11 acres that the company owns on Coil Avenue, 
rather than just the one acre he leased. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it had hoped to begin construction in March of a cold-storage 
warehouse, but the suit alleges that the firm still cannot begin work because 
of the mess left by Brent Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. also filed suit against Brent Petroleum, 
demanding the removal of soil that it said spilled onto its adjacent railroad 
right of way. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Crimes Section of the district attorney's office, meanwhile, 
investigated Brent Petroleum for possible illegal transportation or disposal of 
hazardous waste, Deputy Dist. Atty. David H. Guthman said. 
</P>
<P>
But the case was dropped in May after the county Department of Health Services 
said the soil was not contaminated to levels that it considered hazardous, 
Guthman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bouchard continues to operate a second soil dump on Cervera Avenue near Anaheim 
Street in Wilmington, not far from the Coil Avenue dump. Brent Petroleum has 
not been cited for the operation of the Cervera dump.

CITY COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER PERMIT FOR QUARRY IN AZUSA

<P>
The fate of the Azusa Rock Co. was shuffled back to the Planning Commission by 
the City Council for further review. 
</P>
<P>
The order for reconsideration came after a hearing in which some residents 
called the quarry a nuisance that creates dust in the air and has scarred the 
mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the council directed the commission to review the operations of the 
rock quarry on Fish Canyon Road to determine if its special-use permit, granted 
in 1956, should be revoked. The commission decided Azusa Rock was complying 
with the conditions set for its operation. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday night, the council voted 3 to 2 to have the commission 
re-evaluate the quarry, looking particularly at new vegetation for the 
mountain, one of the conditions added to the original permit in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no change whatsoever," said Councilman Harry Stemrich. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Davis, environmental manager for Azusa Rock, blamed the drought for the 
lack of landscaping on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Tony Naranjo and John Dangleis, who voted against the 
reconsideration, said they saw no need for further review. "We're playing 
political football," Naranjo said. "The facts are in front of us and I'm 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
No deadline was set for the second Planning Commission review.

EDUCATION: ACTING SUPT. SOL LEVINE, WHO HELPED KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN DURING 
LAST YEAR'S STRIKE, KEEPS THE JOB HE HAS BEEN DOING SINCE JUNE.

The Beverly Hills Board of Education has named Sol Levine, a key figure during 
the 13-day teachers' strike last year, to succeed Robert French as 
superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, a longtime principal of Beverly Hills High School, has been doing the 
district's top job since June, when he was named acting superintendent after 
French's unexpected retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Board of Education has made a well-thought-out and conscientious decision 
not to endure the long and tedious undertaking and the costly expense of a 
search for a new superintendent when we have the person right here . . . who is 
the best possible person for the job," school board President Frank Fenton said 
Wednesday. The board decided on the appointment at its meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fenton said Levine would be able to "hit the ground running" as the district 
faces severe budget cuts in the wake of the failure at the polls in June of a 
parcel tax referendum intended to increase school funding. 
</P>
<P>
An honors graduate of Brooklyn College in New York, from which he also holds a 
master's degree in history and education, Levine came to Beverly Hills as 
principal of the high school in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The author of "U.S.A.," a high school history textbook, he was named assistant 
superintendent in charge of curriculum in 1989, just in time for the October 
teachers' strike, when he was instrumental in organizing the district's effort 
to keep the schools open. 
</P>
<P>
The strike ended Nov. 1, when teachers narrowly approved an offer of a 12% 
increase in salary, over two years.

"He was sleeping there sometimes . . . fielding calls from 5 a.m. to 10 o'clock 
at night," said school board member Dana Tomarken, who was president of the 
board at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very instrumental in settling the strike, meeting with the teachers, 
and he's been instrumental in all the major decisions and been on the front 
line over the years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
He was also in charge of a complete overhaul of the high school curriculum 
several years ago, Tomarken said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, 58, said Wednesday that he is "very, very thrilled and excited by the 
appointment. . . . I just feel that we've got a great community, a great 
teaching staff and great kids, and those are the ingredients you need to 
maintain a top-flight school district." 
</P>
<P>
He said he saw the district's financial problems as a challenge and added, "I'm 
very, very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Beverly Hills Education Assn., which represents the 
district's teachers, were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The school district, which is scrambling to maintain its traditional high 
standards at a time when funding is largely determined by the state, had hoped 
to raise about $4.5 million a year through a parcel tax proposal that was put 
to the voters in June. The proposal fell just four votes short of the 
two-thirds majority needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have assessed property-owners between $250 and $750 a year, 
depending on the size and use of their land parcels. 
</P>
<P>
The 4,700-student district also receives about $5 million in city funds and 
receives hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from parent contributions and 
revenues from an oil well on the Beverly Hills High School campus. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the parcel tax measure forced the district to eliminate 41 
teaching-level positions for the 1990-91 school year, including counselors, 
librarians, nurses and teachers, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five non-teaching positions were also eliminated, but no more layoffs 
are expected in the immediate future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major tasks we have is to take the dollars we have and maintain the 
top-quality educational program we've always had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, father of three grown daughters, lives in Van Nuys with his wife, 
Marilyn. He said he is "very involved" in writing books, including a historical 
novel "having nothing to do with Beverly Hills."

SENATE CANDIDATES SLUG IT OUT OVER FAIR CAMPAIGN PLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dueling Pledges: The titans continue to clash in the fair campaign pledge 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) -- who already rejected the 
pledge proffered by his opponent in the state Senate race -- has come up with 
one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Bader's opponent, Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), promptly rejected 
it, saying it doesn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala himself had last week asked Bader to join him in pledging that their 
campaign mailers would not refer to each other during the last five weeks 
before the election in order to prevent last-minute smears. Bader laughed at 
that idea, saying that talking about the other candidate's record is what 
campaigns are all about. 
</P>
<P>
Bader then drew up his own campaign code, calling for a prohibition on personal 
attacks, a cutoff in campaign mailers the Saturday before the election and a 
series of six debates between the candidates. Ayala called Bader's proposal "a 
thinly disguised protection of his right to do last-minute hit pieces," and 
said he will not sign it. 
</P>
<P>
Will the dazzling one-upmanship continue through the Nov. 6 election? Stay 
tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Bedtime for Nymeyer: After going into closed session just after midnight 
Monday, the Pomona City Council returned to a near-empty council chamber. Most 
of the audience had lost interest in the meeting -- or had given up hope that 
the council would ever return -- and wisely went home to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer apparently wanted to do the same and departed 
before the council voted to adjourn. Another councilman, Tomas Ursua, was 
dispatched to retrieve Nymeyer, who was headed for his car, so the meeting 
could be officially closed. With Nymeyer present, the council voted unanimously 
to adjourn at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
County Them Out: Talk of secession continues to ripple through San Gabriel 
Valley cities angered by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's redrawing of 
supervisorial district lines. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric ran high at Tuesday's meeting of the La Verne City Council. A 
sample: Councilman Patrick Gatti called Kenyon's decision "judicial rape." 
Mayor Pro Tem Thomas Harvey termed it "arrogant." Mayor Jon Blickenstaff said 
it appears to be an attempt to "divide and conquer" the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Council members criticized Kenyon for lumping La Verne with such faraway cities 
as Palmdale instead of with nearby cities such as Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey and Councilman Craig Walters suggested that if district lines cannot be 
drawn in a fashion more agreeable to La Verne, the city should consider 
withdrawing from Los Angeles County to form a new county with other disgruntled 
San Gabriel Valley cities. 
</P>
<P>
Short subject: Latest campaign report filings by Democratic officeholders show 
that they gave generously from their campaign funds to help Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown defeat the reapportionment initiatives on the June ballot. 
Assembly members Sally Tanner of Baldwin Park and Richard Polanco of Los 
Angeles, who also represents part of Pasadena, each gave $20,000 to the effort.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: MK'S; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST IMPRESSION; 
</P>
<P>
A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM OFFERS PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND TOP-QUALITY FOOD AT NEW 
RESTAURANT.

The word on the street: MK's is hot. But on a recent late summer afternoon, 
walking into the restaurant's courtyard for the first time, I found MK's to be 
an oasis. A warm breeze flowed through the patio as the sun sent shadows 
dancing across the restaurant's desert-colored walls. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is the creation of two MK's: Michelle Katherine Sandoval and 
Martin Kenneth Gay. They're the husband-and-wife team who previously operated 
the successful Voila in Ventura. Voila's success may have created a sense of 
anticipation for the Sandoval-Gay project. 
</P>
<P>
Now that MK's is open for business, it's frequently packed -- both with locals 
and out-of-towners. But reservations are usually easy to get. And the service 
is friendly and professional. Sandoval, who is usually seen moving about the 
restaurant, seems to have done a first-class job in training her staff to be 
responsive to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband runs the kitchen, and some of his dishes are very, very good. 
There's seafood Vera Cruz, full of fresh salmon and scallops, prawn-size 
shrimp, olives and fresh mushrooms in a salsa wine sauce. And there's an 
impressive "grazing platter" of grilled vegetables, grains, soft cheese, 
chutney, salsa and an occasional surprise or two. In his penne vodka, Gay takes 
a vodka and cream sauce, adds sun-dried tomatoes and reduces the mixture down 
so it's not cloyingly heavy, as white sauces often are. 
</P>
<P>
His pork chops are stuffed with a carefully seasoned mixture of apples, raisins 
and almonds, then flamed in a Madeira sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when I ordered the grilled chicken breast marinated in tequila, I did get 
an overcooked piece of meat. But the waiter very graciously took the chicken 
back and replaced it with a juicy breast that did justice to its tequila sauce. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of so-so dishes. The chopped salad with sun-dried tomatoes, 
for instance, forces one to look carefully for the tomato hidden among the 
greens. And MK's fideo, vermicelli cooked in a chicken broth with vegetables, 
was surprisingly bland. 
</P>
<P>
But there is great bread here -- perfect, fresh cracked wheat bread that MK's 
gets from a small wholesale operation in Ojai called Monica's. 
</P>
<P>
And there's always dessert. You'll go far before finding a better apricot 
cobbler. Its pastry is soaked with apricot juices and it's not too sweet. This 
is the sort of dish that could take even a non-dessert person right to the 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: MK's in Ojai, 139 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai. (805) 640-8001. 
Breakfast 8-11 a.m. Monday, Wednesday-Friday; until noon Saturday-Sunday. Lunch 
11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday-Friday; noon-2:30 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. 
Dinner 5-10 p.m. Wednesday-Monday. Full bar. Reservations accepted. Major

The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
Downey's is expensive, and sometimes it is worth it. The duck, no matter how it 
is prepared, is excellent. Add some of Downey's outstanding appetizers, such as 
the grilled squab, and flawless desserts, the Belgian chocolate marquis, for 
example, and you'll avoid the pitfalls -- overcooked fish and undistinguished 
beef and lamb dishes. Downey's is at 1305 State St., Santa Barbara, (805) 
966-5006. Dinner Tuesday to Sunday from 5:3O p.m. Dinner for two, food only, 
$65 to $80. 
</P>
<P>
Voila Cafe may be in an ordinary little California stucco house, but the food 
is anything but nondescript. This restaurant knows how to come up with a fine 
dining experience, including a wonderful Sunday brunch. Calling itself a bistro 
cafe, it serves a variety of interesting dishes accompanied by superb 
vegetables. Baked chevre is a salad of crisp romaine and raw vegetables with 
warmed, pungent goat cheese on top. Filet Madrid is steak in a sauce of red 
peppers, fresh tomatoes, onions and cilantro. Summer pasta comes with onions, 
mushrooms, broccoli and big succulent shrimp. Desserts are spectacular. Voila 
Cafe is at 1095 Thompson Blvd., Ventura, 643-9445. Lunch and dinner are served 
11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Breakfast, lunch and dinner 8 a.m. to 
9 p.m. Saturday; Sunday brunch 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Dinner for two, food only $27 
to $46. Sunday brunch with champagne $16.50 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi Marina may not look much like a traditional Japanese restaurant, but the 
sushi is wonderful, and the place has a kind of happy-hour energy even during 
the week. Soft-shelled crab is a wonderful appetizer, crisp, crunchy and 
delicate, and the teriyaki beef is as good as it gets. Non-traditional sushi 
rolls include the Philly, made with cooked salmon and cream cheese, and the 
dragon roll, a deft concoction of sea eel and avocado. Sushi Marina is at 120 
S. California St., Ventura, 643-5200. Lunch Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 
p.m.; dinner Monday through Sunday 5:30 to 10 p.m. Dinner for two, food only, 
$22 to $62.50. 
</P>
<P>
It's not back in Texas or Tennessee, but off the highway going into Saticoy 
that Buster's Original Bar-B-Q and Bakery sits, dishing out down-home style 
ribs, chicken and the house specialty -- the best tri-tip sandwich between San 
Diego and the Oregon border. The line in front of the outdoor grill goes into 
the parking lot. The baked goods can be tasty or just so-so, but Buster's 
brings an authentic bit of barbecue to Ventura County. Buster's is at 1201 S. 
Wells Road, Saticoy, 647-2103. Open Tuesday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
Saturday-Sunday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Meal for two, food only, $10 to $20.

NOT ALL A BUNCH OF MONDO DEPRESSO SNIVELERS IN BLACK, THE BAND HAS A SOCIAL 
CONSCIENCE.

Let's talk about the good job you've been dreaming of, that of being a rock 
god. The Mission U.K., which will be at the Ventura Theatre on Saturday night, 
is continuing its tour after taking a couple of months off to watch the World 
Cup. Hey, boss, I'm going to take off until October to root for the Dodgers -- 
just keep sending those checks to my P.O. box, OK? Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, in addition to having flexible hours, the Mission U.K. is also doing 
just fine with its latest release, "Carved in Sand." Not all a bunch of mondo 
depresso snivelers in black, the Mission U.K. is, in fact, on a mission -- the 
band has a social conscience. The new album contains songs about child abuse 
("Amelia"), the dignity of labor ("The Grapes of Wrath") and even an 
anti-addiction song ("Hungry Is the Hunter"). 
</P>
<P>
Formed four years ago in Leeds, England, by Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams, both 
former guitarists from a band called the Sisters of Mercy, Mission U.K. has 
since released four albums and will be making its second appearance at the 
venerable Ventura Theatre. Intense, hook-filled guitar rock perhaps best 
describes the Mission U.K., but let's let front man Hussey tell it: 
</P>
<P>
How's the album and the tour going? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know, but it's actually time to get started again. We've taken a few 
months off to follow the World Cup -- England will be back in four years, one 
way or another. We'll be doing about five shows in California. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Mission U.K.? Is there also a Mission USSR or a Mission USA? 
</P>
<P>
Oh no, there used to be a soul group in America called the Mission, and you 
have a very different legal system than we do. We're intending to phase out the 
U.K. gradually. 
</P>
<P>
Your band was named for a Robert De Niro movie. Could the band just as easily 
have been named the King of Comedy, Taxi Driver or the Deer Hunter? 
</P>
<P>
No, we like the name. Besides, we only have four channels over here. 
</P>
<P>
Your song "The Grapes of Wrath" is about a famous American movie without Robert 
De Niro. Will there be songs about other classics, perhaps "Gunga Din," "It's a 
Wonderful Life" or "Citizen Kane"? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know, we just love "The Grapes of Wrath." I've got it on tape. We only 
have four channels -- it's not like America. 
</P>
<P>
How did the band get started? 
</P>
<P>
It was a happy accident, really. After the Sisters of Mercy broke up, I just 
wanted to continue working with Craig Adams. And since I was better looking and 
had a better voice, I became the lead singer. 
</P>
<P>
On your bio, you're quoted as saying you hate ignorance. Do most bands 
perpetuate or combat ignorance? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I'm not sure. But music can change people, and if you change enough 
people. . . . The Beatles for example, changed people, but the effects weren't 
felt for a number of years, even after they split up. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a generic Mission U.K. fan? 
</P>
<P>
Most of our fans are very much like us. There is, of course, the faction that's 
dressed in black with spiked purple hair, but most of them are like us. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the Mission U.K. most popular? 
</P>
<P>
In Europe. Also we do well in California and the large cities -- the more 
cosmopolitan places where people are more informed. 
</P>
<P>
Why should people go see the Mission U.K.? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know. I'm not sure I'd go myself. Actually, our live shows are never 
the same twice -- we're quite capable of falling to pieces or putting on the 
best show you've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best thing about being a rock god? 
</P>
<P>
I suppose getting into clubs for free. And it's like all the years you've spent 
struggling just to save up enough money to buy some guitar strings, and now all 
these things are just handed to you on a plate. We're having a good time -- 
we've achieved all of our original goals. Everything is quite nice now. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any current bands you like? 
</P>
<P>
All About Eve, the Waterboys, the Cure, the Wonderstuff -- that's it.

PARKLAND DEAL FALLS THROUGH; 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU: THE 1,600 ACRES WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC PARK. FEDERAL 
FUNDS FOR THE $25-MILLION PROPERTY APPEAR TO BE UNAVAILABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A potential transaction in which the investment group that owns the Los Angeles 
Athletic Club had agreed to sell 1,600 acres of rugged mountain land in Malibu 
for use as a public park has collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is disappointing, but the financing simply wasn't there," said Ruth Kilday, 
executive director of the Mountains Conservancy Foundation, which had agreed to 
pay Laaco Ltd., the investment group, $25 million for the property. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, negotiated last spring, was contingent on Congress' appropriating at 
least $20 million for the National Park Service to acquire land in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Although the lawmakers have yet to decide on the amount, it 
is certain to be well below $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Laaco said this week that the group had no immediate plans for 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
"That's obviously something that will be decided in due course, but there's 
really nothing to report at this time," spokesman Alex Auerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and others, who had hailed the potential acquisition as 
extremely significant, have expressed concern that since the deal has fallen 
through, Laaco may now attempt to sell the property to a private developer. 
</P>
<P>
The property, which overlooks the Pacific Ocean, stretches from Pacific Coast 
Highway about four miles into Topanga Canyon on both sides of Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
When the foundation announced the potential acquisition in May, 
environmentalists called the property, which links the mountains to the sea, 
"the last piece of a puzzle" in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The property includes a narrow strip along Pacific Coast Highway where there 
are several businesses and dozens of small homes, whose residents had expressed 
concern about their future had the foundation acquired it. The property is just 
outside the boundary of the future city of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is a private, nonprofit land trust set up in 1983 to buy 
property and hold it until a state or federal agency is able to acquire it. The 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had agreed to give the foundation $140,000 
to help arrange the acquisition, and the Sierra Club had said it was prepared 
to donate another $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Had the foundation succeeded in acquiring it, the land would have probably been 
added to Topanga State Park, which borders it on the north and east, or the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, depending on whether the state 
or federal government had taken the lead in acquiring it, sources involved in 
the negotiation said. 
</P>
<P>
The state has often expressed interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
Once part of a Spanish land grant known as the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, the 
property was involved in a boundary dispute resolved by a land patent signed by 
President James Garfield in 1881, a month before he was fatally wounded by an 
assassin's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletic Club, founded in 1880, bought the land in the 1930s from newspaper 
publisher William Randolph Hearst. It has long resisted overtures from the 
state and private developers to acquire it. 
</P>
<P>
Laaco was formed in 1986, and is majority-owned by the Hathaway family of Los 
Angeles, which for years has had controlling interest in the Athletic Club. 
Laaco owns extensive property in downtown Los Angeles, as well as several 
thousand acres in Kern County that it uses as a duck-hunting preserve for club 
members. In 1988, it sold the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades to 
Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation became involved in negotiating for the Malibu property in April 
after talks between Laaco and a private developer broke off. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Laaco officials declined to say who may have expressed interest 
in the property or what kind of use for it they may have had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources familiar with the negotiation with the foundation speculated 
that, while Laaco may have obtained a better price from a private developer, 
any such deal would have likely been contingent on the uncertain prospect of 
the developer's plans being approved by the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Kilday said the foundation is still interested in the 
land. "We intend to keep our eye on it," she said. "We hope that in the future 
we may have another chance at it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COLLAPSED DEAL 
</P>
<P>
Shaded area marks 1,600 acres of Malibu land, part of fizzled deal between the 
Los Angeles Athletic Club and the Mountains Conservancy Foundation. The 
agreement was contingent on Congress' appropriating at least $20 million for 
the National Park Service to acquire parkland. Lawmakers have yet to decide on 
amount, but it is certain to be well below $20 million.

Turf is their trade, uncertainty their lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogers and Gramckow families of Ventura County, Southern California's 
leading sod wholesalers, are competitors, neighbors and former colleagues on 
the Oxnard Plain. In the past year, they have seen green yards go brown, heard 
landscapers lament a statewide slump in new housing starts and sensed a rising 
environmentalist sentiment against the traditional American lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a set of circumstances that we've never faced before," Jurgen Gramckow 
said recently, speaking from his family's 1,000-acre Southland Sod Farm on East 
Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we just have to wait and see," said Beth Rogers, who with her husband 
runs Pacific Sod, a farm of comparable acreage that lies five miles west down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
The American lawn, by the estimate of The Lawn Institute in Pleasant Hill, 
Tenn., is a $25-billion industry in the United States, covering more than 25 
million acres. California's Department of Food and Agriculture estimated that 
in 1988, the state's sod wholesalers took in revenues of $16.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the industry's roots are relatively shallow. Turf grasses are not native to 
this continent, and historians say the proliferation of the lawn didn't begin 
here until Frederick Law Olmsted wrote rows of them into his 1868 plans for the 
Chicago suburb of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 122 years later, the Gramckows and the Rogerses watch and wait. 
</P>
<P>
They plant grasses that take less water. They remind customers that grass 
reduces fire hazards, cuts down soil erosion, purifies the air and amounts to a 
small fraction of the state's overall water usage. And they assure themselves 
and others that by now, most Californians must be wed to the idea of the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the industry's biggest years, after all, were those immediately after 
the Northern California drought of 1976 and 1977, when homeowners were 
replenishing their yards. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, there are a lot more people talking about cactus gardens and 
indigenous-plant xeri-scapes. And in the wake of the national savings and loan 
industry crisis, authorities say bank loans for construction and landscaping 
seem to be drying up even faster than the state's reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Denne Goldstein, publisher of Landscape &amp; Irrigation, a trade journal based 
in Van Nuys, estimates that the sod business, like the landscaping business, 
has grown about 20% annually the past 10 years. But this year, Goldstein said 
recently, he expects businesses to slow down 17% to 23% -- a reversion to 1988 
sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Whitman, who was writing poetry while Olmsted was at work on the greening 
of Illinois, concluded that a leaf of grass is "no less than the journey-work 
of the stars." For the Gramckows and the Rogerses, it is both more and less: 
It's a living. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Gramckow, raised near Hamburg and trained in an import-export business, 
emigrated from West Germany in 1950. He studied accounting at UCLA and landed a 
job with Cal-Turf, a Camarillo farm that was among the pioneers of West Coast 
turf-growing in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
He also sent a son to Stanford. And when Jurgen Gramckow returned with an 
engineering degree, father and son leased some land and went into business for 
themselves with a turf wholesaling operation they called Pacific Sod Farm. 
</P>
<P>
"Because he understood the business side of it," Jurgen Gramckow said, "he was 
willing to take a chance on the horticultural side." 
</P>
<P>
The business had its attractions. Once used only for large-scale, short-term 
projects such as exposition displays, sod came into demand as ready-made 
landscaping to accompany the California housing boom of the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Zuckerman, a Stockton sod grower and president of the California Sod 
Producers Assn., estimates that there were 3,000 acres of sod farms in 
California 20 years ago, and that there are twice as many now. In Southern 
California, Gramckow said, his firm and its top competitor probably raise 
two-thirds of the available wholesale sod. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 20 or 30 years it's come from a non-existent commodity to 
something that everybody's heard about," Gramckow said. "The industry has 
matured." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Werner Gramckow said, he was ready to expand, but his 
financial backers weren't. He arranged for them to sell their interests to Tom 
Davis, their landlord and a rancher whose family had been in Ventura County for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1974 Davis died and passed the operation to his family. "We couldn't get 
along," the elder Gramckow said, "and I decided that was that." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Gramckows struck off on their own. 
</P>
<P>
And once again, they landed at a Hueneme Road address, this time under the name 
Southland Sod Farm. Industry observers say Pacific Sod remains a much larger 
firm, but over the past decade, Southland has sold increasing amounts of a turf 
labeled Marathon -- a tall fescue with a deep root system and a reputation as a 
drought-resistant grass. (Pacific Sod down the road sells an essentially 
identical turf under the name Medallion. Both generally retail for 30 to 35 
cents per square foot.) The elder Gramckow, now 70, remains a general partner 
in the business but often yields the public spotlight to his son. 
</P>
<P>
Now 42, Jurgen Gramckow lives in Ventura with his wife and three children. On 
weekends, he tinkers on his sportfishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Jurgen is very well-read" in industry literature, said Eddie Zuckerman, owner 
of Delta Blue Grass Co. in Stockton and president of the California Sod 
Producers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very disciplined individual, and he's all business." 
</P>
<P>
"I could probably be termed a lifer," Gramckow said one recent morning. "This 
business in its growth has had a lot of challenges. And now there are new 
challenges, having to do not so much with business growth but managing the 
business to adjust to the ups and downs of the cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Gramckow's principal competition, meanwhile, is the firm he and his father 
started more than 20 years ago. These days, that company is run by Tom Davis's 
daughter, Beth, and her husband, Richard Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want the quality of life we've all known," Beth Rogers said recently, 
falling into a familiar speech, "you have to commit a certain percentage of 
your water supply to gardens. We never have had enough rain to sustain any of 
the plants you see. We are an irrigated society." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, 45, grew up on the Westside of Los Angeles, spending summers in Ventura 
County among her father's lima beans, tomatoes and row crops. She attended 
UCLA, earned a master's degree in anthropology and had set her sights on a 
doctorate in anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
But with the death of her father in 1974, and then the death of her first 
husband in 1977, she found herself pushed toward business. She went back to 
school for an MBA, and soon was in the sod business, which remains one of her 
favorite subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The drought predicament of the turf industry, she often argues, is really "a 
political infrastructure issue." Southern California has already built a 
society that requires more water than it naturally receives. So the most 
important question, Rogers said, is not whether but how to go about getting 
that water. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, she said, the home-building slump has had a greater direct 
economic effect on business than the drought. She cites statistics: By the 
count of the state Construction Industry Research Board, new housing starts 
fell from an annualized rate of 165,200 in May, 1989, to 113,000 in May, 1990. 
For a turf grower that's a lot of unlaid lawns. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Beth Rogers married Richard Rogers, who now oversees most farm 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The two, who have five children ages 11 to 18, keep residences in southern 
Santa Barbara County and Los Angeles, as well as the farm near Camarillo. They 
are both urban and rural, attending concert series at the Hollywood Bowl, 
driving to the farm on mornings after. 
</P>
<P>
They have about 2,000 acres of turf on five farms statewide, roughly half of 
that acreage in Ventura County, and do much of their business in Northern 
California and elsewhere. To economize on water use, Pacific Sod augments its 
well water with reclaimed water from the Thousand Oaks sewage treatment plant. 
(Southland Sod pumps its own water up from wells, paying fees to the United 
Water Conservation District and, like Pacific Sod, irrigating under guidelines 
set by the state Department of Water Resources.) 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the couple did diversify a bit, setting out to grow a variety of 
vegetation at Pacific Arbor Nurseries at Las Posas and Hueneme roads. That 
operation opened for sales this year. But that, Richard Rogers cautioned, 
doesn't mean he has joined the "turf-bashers" or the "religious fringe" of 
xeri-scapists. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reading," he said, "is that logic will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
But in the logic of a drought-wary public, newly cautious in its housing 
purchases, just how much sod will be enough? Will the grass be greener, or 
leaner, on the other guy's lawn? 
</P>
<P>
"We ask ourselves those questions," Beth Rogers said. "I wish I knew." 
</P>

MARSHALL FUNDAMENTAL HIGH'S MCALISTER TRIES TO MAKE NAME FOR HIMSELF AS COACH; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: FORMER UCLA AND NFL PLAYER TRIES TO BRING A WINNING TOUCH TO 
FOOTBALL-POOR HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When James McAlister was first hired as football coach at Marshall Fundamental 
High last spring, he didn't mention a word about his athletic past to his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
But the coach said one member of the team was a little more intrigued than the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
After all, McAlister, 38, still had the appearance and physique of somebody who 
could hold his own on the field. 
</P>
<P>
So the player went to research his coach's past at a public library. He found 
that McAlister had starred as a running back at Blair High, UCLA and the 
Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"After he looked it up he told everyone who I was and what I'd accomplished 
and, naturally, they were all very impressed," McAlister said. "I also found a 
lot of parents who remembered me." 
</P>
<P>
For McAlister, the attention is something he has always enjoyed but rarely 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
He would prefer to focus on the task ahead of him. It is a challenge that could 
be greater than any he ever faced as a player. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season as a head coach, McAlister's mission will be to rebuild a 
team that struggled to a 1-9 record last year and has always been in the shadow 
of Muir, Pasadena and Blair high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a heck of a challenge but I've always been the kind of person who never 
underestimates my opponents," McAlister said. "I just did what I had to do to 
get it done and that's what I'm going to do here." 
</P>
<P>
He said much of the challenge will be breaking down mental barriers that might 
have formed in players in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have to show these kids that they're just as good as anyone else," 
McAlister said. "I think it's important that they get last year out of their 
minds. This is a new coach with a new coaching staff and we don't have anything 
to do with what happened here before." 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said he also has to build enough interest to keep top players in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is to keep the players interested enough to stay in the 
program instead of transferring to Pasadena, Muir or Blair," he said. "We're 
trying to establish a winning tradition and hopefully, with my name and 
background, we can start to establish a tradition and not only have three good 
schools in Pasadena but four." 
</P>
<P>
His first project in establishing a football tradition at the school is to 
build an on-campus weight room. 
</P>
<P>
"That will make a big difference," he said. "We also need to instill pride like 
other successful programs have and we also need to have dedication. Hopefully 
with pride and dedication we'll start winning like other schools do." 
</P>
<P>
He is also hoping to develop a rivalry with Blair akin to the annual Muir vs. 
Pasadena game in the Rose Bowl. The teams meet in the second game of the season 
on Sept. 14 at Pasadena City College, but McAlister hopes there will be enough 
interest to play the game in the Rose Bowl by the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister has already received high marks from administrators at Marshall with 
his strong, positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate his brand of enthusiasm and it's very contagious," Marshall 
Athletic Director Paul Bodenshot said. "I'm highly optimistic about the 
program. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Said defensive coordinator Anthony Taylor: "Just because of him, the interest 
of the kids has changed. He's got them much more excited about football. He's 
always been a hands-on manager and he's been able to bring a lot of kids back 
who either quit or didn't want to play." 
</P>
<P>
That was evident during spring practice, when he had between 25 to 30 players 
participating. It was a pretty good turnout when you consider that the Eagles 
finished last season with only 14 players. 
</P>
<P>
The results on the field were also promising during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had pretty good success with it from what I've seen so far," McAlister 
said. "We had our summer (passing) league and went 7-1-2. We improved 100% from 
last season and I've had other coaches tell me that, too." 
</P>
<P>
He also noticed an improved work ethic in his players during the first day of 
practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the kids that practice started at 8 a.m. and most of the kids were 
here by 7:30," McAlister said. "Some were even out running before 7." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said the early success stems from persuading the players to believe 
in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
That is a trait that McAlister developed early in his high school career after 
a motivational discussion with a 10th-grade counselor at Blair, Jessie Beguay. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the one that opened my eyes to the fact that I could be somebody if I 
just kept trying and was willing to work at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister played at Blair from 1967 to 1970, leaving behind several CIF 
Southern Section records. 
</P>
<P>
His best season was 1969, when he combined with running back Kermit Johnson. 
The Blair Pair led the Vikings to a 13-0 record and the school's first and only 
Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
"To be 13-0 is incredible," he said. "It's hard to duplicate that kind of a 
season and as players we knew we had something special." 
</P>
<P>
McAlister, who was subsequently selected CIF player of the year, finished his 
prep career among the all-time Southern Section scoring leaders. He is tied for 
10th in career touchdowns with 54, tied for ninth for touchdowns in a season 
with 31 and tied for fifth for points in a season with 228. 
</P>
<P>
For much of McAlister's career, his name always seemed to be mentioned with 
Johnson -- and not without just cause. 
</P>
<P>
After their successful high school careers, the players decided to continue 
their football careers at UCLA. After playing for the Bruins from 1971 to 1974, 
the two stayed together in their first season in the pros with the Southern 
California Sun of the defunct World Football League. 
</P>
<P>
It was after their first season with the Sun that they decided it was time to 
pursue careers in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wound up playing for two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers. When his 
career was finished, he became a fireman in Pasadena and has since become a 
city fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
They are still friends, McAlister said, although they do not see each other 
much anymore. "We run into each other now and then but we don't really go out 
of our way to see each other," he said. "We still respect each other, we've 
just gone our separate ways like a lot of people do." 
</P>
<P>
As for McAlister's NFL career, he found a measure of success in three seasons 
with the Eagles from 1975 to 1977 and one season with the Patriots in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister had his best season in 1978, when he started in the Patriot backfield 
with USC standout Sam Cunningham. McAlister received eight game balls during 
that season. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also finished the 1978 season in good shape physically. That's why 
it was a shock to teammates when he announced after the season that he was 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided that it was time to walk away from the sport," McAlister said. 
"We had just lost to Houston and Earl Campbell in the first round of the 
playoffs and I said that's enough." 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said he probably had the ability to play another four or five seasons 
but wanted to leave the game healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own honest opinion, I figured it was time to get out," he said. "Being 
at that level five years was enough. I had my share of injuries but I never had 
an injury that required major surgery in my career. I felt that because I could 
still run and jump and I was able to work out, it was the right time to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Following his retirement, McAlister spent two years as a social studies teacher 
at Edison Junior High in Los Angeles. He also worked in an after-school sports 
program in conjunction with the Sugar Ray Youth Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
His football coaching career started as an assistant at Blair in 1980. He 
coached six years at Blair, under Herb Robinson from 1980 to 1982, Steve 
Somerlot in 1983-84 and Gene Zeller in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In between, he has found time to work on numerous community projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really a community-oriented person," he said. "A lot of things I've done 
most people probably don't know about. I've been involved in the community from 
preschool to youth leagues to Pop Warner." 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, he has also owned a successful carpet cleaning business 
in Pasadena. "It allows me to come and go as I please although it wasn't that 
way at first," he said. "At first I was working 16- to 18-hour days." 
</P>
<P>
After his last coaching stint as an assistant at Blair, McAlister spent the 
1989 football season coaching a Junior All-America team at Victory Park in 
Pasadena. He also coached the Marshall baseball team last season. 
</P>
<P>
But when the football coaching position at Marshall opened last spring, 
McAlister was interested. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard this job had opened up I immediately applied," he said. "I wasn't 
sure if I would get the job but I thought to myself, 'Who knows, you never can 
tell.' I knew that there would be more qualified applicants in front of me but 
in my heart I knew that I could do the job because I know kids and what 
motivates them." 
</P>
<P>
Although he wasn't the school's first choice for the job, McAlister was more 
than happy to accept the position in early May. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I wasn't the first choice but it was one of those times when being 
second was OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McAlister is hoping the position will give him another opportunity to return 
something to the city, which he has called home since he moved from Arkansas 
when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Pasadena has been so good to me, I feel I have something to give back 
to the community," he said. "It's very important to me that I take what has 
been given to me and give some of it back." 
</P>
<P>
Never one to shy away from lofty goals, McAlister has high ambitions for the 
immediate and distant future. 
</P>
<P>
He is not predicting miracles but expects the Eagles to be successful in his 
first season. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids I'm not here to win two games and I'm not here to win three 
games," he said. "As long as we work hard and do everything we're supposed to, 
we can win every game we play. Why settle for two or three games." 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said he eventually wants to become a head coach at a major 
university. 
</P>
<P>
But for the moment, McAlister realizes that his most difficult challenge is 
coaching the Eagles.

BOXING IN A BALLROOM BY THE BEACH: WHERE ELSE BUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A saxophone and piano are being played. Bartenders draw beers and pour wine. 
Hot dogs, brownies and cookies wait to be eaten. A crowd gathers behind doors 
not yet open. 
</P>
<P>
It is nearly time for Boxing by the Beach at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Two women in tight skirts and low necklines enter the foyer and are offended 
when mistaken for the curvaceous women who hold up round cards during the 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
The women say they represent a beer company. They sit at a table and autograph 
beer ad posters of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Grand Ballroom, which holds a red-aproned boxing ring, promoter 
Steve Brooks writes checks to people who have provided their services for the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks is a tall young man in jeans and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"All the fighters made weight, so that's a minor miracle," he said. "One was a 
pound over, but they put him on a bike for 40 minutes and he lost it." 
</P>
<P>
Tables are being set up. Little numbers are being affixed to chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 923 seats in the room," a hotel official told Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a lot of calls about tickets," another hotel official told 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
A fire inspector wants to look at the seating chart. "This row has to go 
someplace else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny Ray, a top fighter in the 1950s and now a car painter, has a drink in his 
hand. He says he is a corner man for Ray McElroy of Long Beach, the undefeated 
California middleweight champion who will be in the main event. 
</P>
<P>
The doors open, the crowd files in. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, carrying a tuxedo and cowboy boots, goes to change. 
</P>
<P>
Leah Newman and Darcy Austin wait nervously in a hotel room. They will be two 
of the ring girls, the first time for both. Newman is a cocktail waitress at a 
popular sports bar, where she did well in a recent bikini contest. Austin works 
at a nightclub, where she wrestles customers in hot shaving cream. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath a ceiling of little white lights similar to those that decorate 
Christmas trees, the fights begin. Salvador Montes knocks out Anthony 
(Hummingbird) Corriel in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Newman and Austin, in skimpy bathing suits, parade around the ring. Cheers and 
"yows" rise from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Newman returns to her chair. Her hand shakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Guarding" these women is Kraigo Klier, 23, of Norwalk. A short-sleeved tuxedo 
shirt emphasizes his big biceps. Red hair falls halfway down his back. He has a 
cast on his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Klier said he broke it in a fight at a Black Angus restaurant, where he is a 
bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities are introduced: pop singer Irene Cara and boxer Henry Tillman. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Masucci, the center on the Cal State Long Beach basketball team, gets 
Tillman's autograph. 
</P>
<P>
The smacks from red leather gloves echo during the next two bouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Take him out!" booms Gene Layton, an ex-pro football player who is sitting -- 
by design, he said -- behind the ring girls. 
</P>
<P>
But one person at ringside looks bored. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen more excitement at a Broadway musical," said Gordon James, president 
of the Long Beach Civic Light Opera. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth fight, light-heavyweight Nate Houser, his eyes puffy, crumbles to 
the canvas. A flashlight is shined in his eyes by a doctor. Later, a state 
official said Houser just lay down and quit, and Houser said he is going to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
In line at one of the bars during intermission, Layton said: "This is old-time 
entertainment. These kids are banging hard." 
</P>
<P>
Time for the main event: Ray McElroy vs. Robert (Showdown) Carson of San Pedro. 
Both have tassels on their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Carson can't stand still for the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm for the ring girls ebbs, but rises for the fighters, who slug it 
out. 
</P>
<P>

NEW PROMOTER'S CLASS ACT PACKS WALLOP -- AND THE HOUSE 
</P>

Trying not to flinch against the hard blows the fight business inflicts, 
SteveBrooks presented his first boxing show last week in Long Beach. The young 
promoter made about $4,000, was praised by state officials and is looking 
forward to the next show in September. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real excited to get up and do it again," said Brooks, 25, a former 
basketball player at Wilson High School. "I was expecting maybe 500 people, 
that would have been a decent showing." 
</P>
<P>
But a near-capacity crowd of about 800 turned out Aug. 15 for Boxing by the 
Beach in the Grand Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel. In a sport often known 
for seediness, Brooks is striving for class. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a low-life gym atmosphere," he said. "We try to make sure that the 
ring girls are not too scantily clad, that napkins are laid out perfectly at 
the tables, bouncers are in tuxedo shirts, hostesses in evening gowns. No one 
sells T-shirts or hawks watches, and there's no smoking in the ballroom." 
</P>
<P>
Taking over for Jerry Westlund, who had promoted seven boxing shows at the 
hotel, Brooks formed his own company, West Coast Pro Sports. He received his 
promoter's license this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gung-ho as hell about it," Westlund said. "He's as enthusiastic as anyone 
I've seen. I just hope he doesn't get hardened." 
</P>
<P>
Westlund, who owns an auction company, said he left the boxing business because 
it was too time-consuming. And he had become hardened. 
</P>
<P>
"It stopped being fun," he said. "You get tired of dealing with these people. 
You deal with misfits and ex-felons. They lie, cheat and back-stab over a $20 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
But Brooks disagrees with his longtime friend. "He paints too bleak a picture," 
Brooks said. "The people aren't misfits, they're regular people. I think it 
will be an enjoyable task." 
</P>
<P>
To get started, Brooks sold three cars and "about everything else I had" to 
raise $15,000 required by the California State Athletic Commission as an 
insurance policy in case a promoter cannot pay a purse or judges. There were 
also city fees, advertising costs and office expenses. 
</P>
<P>
He persuaded restaurants, car dealers, a beer company and a gym to sign on as 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really experienced in boxing, but I enjoy sponsorship and promotion, 
trying to sell an entertainment package," Brooks said. "It's something a person 
my age normally doesn't get to do." 
</P>
<P>
He believes his success will depend mostly on the quality of the fights. 
</P>
<P>
"(Boxing fans) don't come for ring girls or jazz bands, they come to see 
fights," he said. "Give them five solid fights and a good sports atmosphere and 
they will come back." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, advertisements for his first show mentioned a "sizzling ring girl 
contest." 
</P>
<P>
"We sell the event, and they're part of the event," Brooks said of the young 
women who parade in bikinis around the ring and hold up cards indicating the 
round number. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing by the Beach has always attracted an upscale audience. "We have our 
coat-and-tie crowd at the ringside tables," Brooks said, "but I think the 
yuppie image is a little overrated. We cater to businesses but we're also 
trying to bring in the real boxing fans." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who had been an assistant to Westlund, said Westlund erred by not 
making an effort to sell the $20 general admission seats. To get the fan 
involved "who doesn't want to spend $40," Brooks distributed 20,000 flyers and 
ran newspaper ads, a campaign that apparently paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold 300 general admission seats at the door last Wednesday night," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlund said that Boxing by the Beach was never intended for the "real" fight 
fans, which he characterizes as men who "chew cigars, spit on the floor and 
want a break on the tickets. We concentrated on selling the $40 and $75 seats 
because they are the first to sell." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for Brooks' Aug. 15 show were $75 (ringside), $40 (VIP) and $20. For 
the Sept. 20 show, he said they will be $50, $35 and $20 -- "a little bit more 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
West Coast Pro Sports is composed of Brooks and three assistants -- his brother 
Craig; Katie Rowe, and John Hatten, a former Cal State Long Beach basketball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who graduated last year with a business degree from Cal State Long 
Beach after playing basketball at Rice University and Long Beach City College, 
has a relaxed image that goes with the jeans and T-shirts he prefers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real complex person," Hatten said. "He can be extremely outgoing, but 
he keeps to himself. He's priority-oriented. We call him a flake because he 
won't play basketball with us if he has something else he feels is more 
important to do." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks has discovered that his new business presents a myriad of priorities and 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
On the recent card, he tried unsuccessfully to find an opponent for Mike Evans, 
a Long Beach heavyweight with a 19-4 record. "The state won't approve a fighter 
they think won't hold his own in the ring," Brooks said. "We (called) Georgia, 
Washington and Utah, but we couldn't find a fighter the state (California) 
would approve." 
</P>
<P>
A few days before the show, Brooks had said that Esias Zumudio, the North 
American Boxing Federation world flyweight champion, would be on the card. But 
an opponent for him could not be found either. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have him next month," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Many problems surfaced the day of the show, which caused it to start an hour 
late. There were no cards for the ring girls. A stretcher had to be borrowed 
from another hotel. The ring canvas had to be tightened. And a lot of people 
wanted to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steve was a little shocked about the pressure," said Westlund, who was 
at the show to help him. "Everybody was on him for money before the fights." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said he wrote checks all day -- for the fighters, the ring announcer, 
the man who put up the ring, the doctor, judges, timekeeper. It seemed a 
never-ending list. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran out of checks that night," Brooks said. "I even had to ask my mom for 
some." 
</P>
<P>
All of these expenses, including $1,500 to the hotel, totaled about $13,000, 
Brooks said. He listed the gate receipts at about $17,000. 
</P>
<P>
For a first-time promoter, it was a very good show, said Dale 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, assistant chief inspector with the state Athletic Commission. "I gave 
them a 9 1/2 as far as the show and the way they conducted themselves." 
</P>
<P>
That made Brooks happy and even more eager to start working on his next show. 
</P>
<P>
He said that what he has learned most is that boxing is a hard business. "You 
have to find people you can trust," he said. "You have to be careful who to 
take advice from. I had people walking out of the woodwork that night telling 
me what I should and shouldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
Westlund understands. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in gung-ho too, and then the 70-30 kicks in," Westlund said. "The job 
of boxing promoter is 70% policeman and 30% baby-sitter. You have to make sure 
people aren't stealing from you and make sure that they were going to do what 
they said they were. 
</P>
<P>
"You keep a positive attitude, but the boxing world is just awful. I think 
Steve is a little naive. You get nickel-and-dimed to death. Guys will come up 
to you and say, 'We're here to do the gloves, give us 75 bucks.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Brooks is undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to treat a valet with as much respect as you do a major sponsor," he 
said. "And the concierge sells tickets for you, so you can't give him a hard 
time. You have to make people feel they're appreciated. Maybe Jerry didn't do 
that. That's why I hope to stick around a little longer."

THE PLAY ABOUT FOUR DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED MEN POIGNANTLY BLENDS HUMOR AND

<P>
A stellar event in regional theater took place Aug. 17 with the ribbon-cutting 
opening of the Paseo Nuevo shopping mall in downtown Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The new Center Stage Theater, an intimate, 150-seat black box on the second 
level of Paseo Nuevo, had its own ribbons cut at 8 p.m. by Mayor Sheila Lodge. 
The glitzy opening night audience, which paid $100 per seat, was treated to the 
premiere performance of Anthony Edwards starring in "The Boys Next Door," an 
Access Theatre company production about the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
There's an old superstition about the quality of the first performance in a new 
theater conferring a permanent blessing or curse. Those who believe in it can 
rest easy, because Edwards and a mostly Equity cast delivered a powerful, 
poignant performance that ended in a well-deserved standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible to laugh at the developmentally disabled? Clive Barnes wrote of 
the 1987 off-Broadway production of Tom Griffin's "The Boys Next Door": "It's a 
funny play and it very adroitly provides its audience with the freedom to 
laugh." 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of laughter Friday night, some of it the kind that hurts. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards plays Jack, a burned-out live-in social worker in an apartment complex 
for the developmentally disabled. Edwards' role is essentially a straight man, 
and he delivers a solid performance -- a strong wire on which are erratically 
strung, like bizarre beads, the character roles of his four housemates. 
</P>
<P>
Norman (Dirk Blocker) is retarded, fat, and addicted to doughnuts, keys and his 
retarded girlfriend, Sheila. Lucien (Haven Mitchell) is serverely retarded, 
black, and 6 feet, 8 inches tall. He's touchingly proud of his Spider-Man tie, 
and he sees no difference between a quarter and a button. Arnold (Richard 
Hochberg) is marginally retarded, scrappy, hyperactive/compulsive,has a rug 
fetish and is convinced life is better in the Soviet Union. Last is Barry (Marc 
Buckland) "a grade-A schizophrenic with a history of institutions," who is 
chillingly intense. He is obsessed with the game of golf, and he gives lessons 
for $1.14 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of vignettes that describe the day-to-day life of these five men, 
other characters appear briefly, most of them portrayed by physically or 
developmentally disabled actors. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that "Rainman" and "My Left Foot" provided rich opportunities 
for actors to delve deep into complex characterizations, so too do these roles, 
and Blocker, Buckland, Hochberg and Mitchell, all seasoned Equity actors, make 
the most of it. Under the direction of Rod Lathim, these sometimes brave, 
sometimes desperate people living on the fringes of society have some heroic 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's Lucien (who could step right into "Of Mice and Men" as Lenny) has a 
set piece that will linger in the memory. At his Social Security hearing to 
have his survival funds restored, he suddenly breaks character, the house goes 
dark except for a spot, and he gives a "fantasy" monologue: 
</P>
<P>
"My capacity for rationalization is somewhere between a 5-year-old and an 
oyster. I am retarded. I am damaged, I am sick inside from so many days, weeks, 
months and years of confusion. I am mystified by faucets, elevators, newspapers 
and popular songs. I can't always remember the names of my parents . . . but I 
will not wither because the cage is too small. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As the lights go up and Mitchell crouches back down into his monosyllabic 
character, the words hang long in the air. 
</P>
<P>
In a sequence in which his father returns from out of nowhere and strikes him 
with a crutch, Buckland dominates a whole scene without speaking or moving. 
From his frozen position on a couch he simply exudes more and more intensity 
until the scene explodes emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
Hochberg's portrayal is packed with nuance. With the twist of his mouth and a 
few fingers he conveys the tragedy of his situation. Blocker's scenes with his 
girlfriend (Susan Kern) are poignant and believable. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of the piece is that one comes away feeling that good actors have 
given their all. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the inherent weakness in the fabric of the script -- that it is only 
episodic and lacks a strong narrative line -- is in part overcome by the 
tension created by high-energy actors on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Technical standards are high. The Complex lighting design and appropriately 
tacky set are credited to Theodore Michael Dolas of Santa Barbara Scenic. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Santa Barbara's Access Theatre presents "The Boys Next Door" 
at the Center Stage Theater at 7O1 State St. in Santa Barbara. Curtain is at 8 
p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and at 2 p.m. Sunday. The show runs through 
Sept. 9. For tickets and information, call 963-0408.

THE ANNUAL FRENCH FESTIVAL BOASTS FOOD, A MINIATURE EIFFEL TOWER AND A PARADE 
OF POODLES.

<P>
When Steve Hoegerman first shared his idea of starting a French Festival in 
Santa Barbara's Oak Park, his friends started making jokes: 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, for atmosphere, why don't you get the Eiffel Tower and stick it right in 
the middle of the park. Ha, ha, ha," Hoegerman said, remembering the teasing he 
received from his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you get a bunch of those French poodles together and make a parade. 
Ha, ha, ha. 
</P>
<P>
"So what's everyone gonna do at a French Festival? Stand around and be rude to 
each other?" 
</P>
<P>
Hoegerman dismissed the last joke. "The Parisians do have a reputation of being 
curt," he said. "But stereotyping the French would be like one of them visiting 
New York and then saying that all Americans yell at each other." 
</P>
<P>
He did take a keener interest in the other two jokes. And now the wooden Eiffel 
Tower and the poodle parade are two regular and whimsical features of the 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The tower, about as tall as a two-story building, looms over the park, 
overseeing the two-day festival this weekend like a demure French ambassador. 
The other 363 days of the year, the structure is separated into three parts 
that Hoegerman stows in his mother's carport. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the tower, other attractions at the third-annual Fete Francaise 
include French food and wine, folk singing and dancing, free French lessons and 
a display of classic and contemporary French cars. The poodle parade will run 
from 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 40 poodles attended, some in costume, some in styled 
coiffeurs, to do tricks or just promenade around the park. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite was this huge, black great dane that someone covered in crumpled 
up pieces of paper to make it look like it had a poodle cut. They called it 
'Mademoiselle Pseudo Poodle," Hoegerman said in an accent achieved through 
years of study and travel. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the event will have a chance to enjoy fine food and wine as 15 
chefs from some of Santa Barbara's best French restaurants prove their talents. 
Customers can eat their meal at dozens of outdoor tables complete with umbrella 
and checkered tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
From that vantage point, they can view the colony of impressionist-style 
painters working at their easels; the mimes and jugglers wandering through the 
crowds; the models showing off the French flair for fashion, and can-can girls 
recalling the years when that style of dance was considered more risque than 
the lambada is today. 
</P>
<P>
Hoegerman, who has a bloodline that classifies him as "marginally French, not 
enough to really count," started the event when no one else would. "The local 
French never started their own French festival," he said, "because they're so 
typically French." 
</P>
<P>
While some people are viewing the antics of the poodle parade, others can enjoy 
the cavorting of the Cahoots improvisational comedy troupe, at 7:30 p.m. 
Sunday. Members invite suggestions from the audience and improvise scenes on 
the spot. Tickets are $6 and available in advance or at the door at Alhecama 
Theatre, 914 Santa Barbara St. (805) 962-8606. 
</P>
<P>
For those wanting to frolic mid-week, mandolinist David Grisman and his new 
quintet will make their Santa Barbara debut tonight at the Victoria Street 
Theater, 33 W. Victoria St. Grisman, who composes and plays an acoustic sound 
known as "Dawg Music," has performed with such artists as James Taylor, Bonnie 
Raitt, and Dolly Parton. Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $15 and available at 
Folk Mote Music (805) 962-0830, and Arlington Ticket Agency, (805) 963-4408. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: The third-annual Santa Barbara French Festival will be 
celebrated Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Oak Park. Admission is 
free. For 24-hour information, call: (805) 568-5933. To register for the poodle 
parade, call (805) 569-1636.

<P>
RISING SON; 
</P>
<P>
THE MELODY MAKERS, LED BY ONE OF BOB MARLEY'S SEVERAL MUSICAL OFFSPRING, WILL 
PERFORM SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, it's Dave. Or Ziggy. Yeah, Bob's kid. David (Ziggy) Marley. Marley and his 
band, the Melody Makers, plus enough other musicians to cast a Cecil B. De 
Mille movie will headline the tree-lined and totally spiffy Santa Barbara 
County Bowl on Saturday night. Also on the bill will be the Family Stand and 
Crucial DBC. 
</P>
<P>
Reggae was popularized by Ziggy's father, Bob, who died of cancer in 1981 when 
Ziggy was 13. The Melody Makers originated around 1979 in Jamaica but became 
well known on a 1985 Bob Marley Memorial tour. 
</P>
<P>
Ziggy, tall and 17 with plenty of dreadlocks, emerged as the star of the tour 
and sang mostly his father's songs. Since then, Ziggy and the Melody Makers 
have recorded four albums, have sold zillions of copies worldwide and received 
two Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
Ziggy is making more money than Bob ever did. He probably needs to. Bob left 11 
children and no will. Rastafarians don't believe in them but lawyers sure do. 
After all the legal hassles, the estate was basically broke. But the family is 
very close. In fact, three siblings, Cedella, Stephen and Sharon, make up the 
Melody Makers. The majority of the backup musicians are from a Chicago-based 
Ethiopian reggae band, Dallol. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Marley's music is quite different than that of his famous father. 
It's not as ponderous and it incorporates pop, soul, rock, jazz and good ol' 
rhythm-and-blues. The current album, "One Bright Day," like the last one, 
"Conscious Party," was produced by Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, the rhythm 
section from the Talking Heads. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that all reggae music has in common is its preachiness. Reggae is all 
about peace, love, justice and harmony -- the good stuff. According to Marley, 
"Reggae is a simple music -- but it's from the heart. Just as people need water 
to drink -- and buy it in bottles -- people also need music. If it is true 
music, then the people will be drawn to it. You don't have to worry if the 
music is filled with life's experiences." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Family Stand, Crucial DBC and Ziggy Marley and the Melody 
Makers will be appearing at The Santa Barbara County Bowl on Saturday. The Bowl 
is located at 1122 N. Milpas St., Santa Barbara, 966-2727. Tickets are $17.50, 
$19.50, $20.50 and $24.50. They are available at Ticketmaster locations, the 
Bowl box office, or by phone, 583-8700. Showtime is 6 p.m.

SOME HEAVY WEIGHTS, FANCY FOOTWORK AT BALLROOM BOXING

It is nearly time for Boxing by the Beach at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long 
Beach. Inside the Grand Ballroom, which holds a red-aproned boxing ring, 
promoter Steve Brooks writes checks to people who have provided their services 
for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"All the fighters made weight, so that's a minor miracle," he said. "One was a 
pound over, but they put him on a bike for 40 minutes and he lost it." 
</P>
<P>
The doors open, the crowd files in. 
</P>
<P>
Leah Newman and Darcy Austin wait nervously in a hotel room. They will be two 
of the ring girls, the first time for both. Newman is a cocktail waitress at a 
popular sports bar, where she did well in a recent bikini contest. Austin works 
at a nightclub, where she wrestles customers in hot shaving cream. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath a ceiling of little white lights similar to those that decorate 
Christmas trees, the fights begin. Salvador Montes knocks out Anthony 
(Hummingbird) Corriel in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Newman and Austin, in skimpy bathing suits, parade around the ring. Cheers and 
"yows" rise from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Newman returns to her chair. Her hand shakes. 
</P>
<P>
The smacks from red leather gloves echo during the next two bouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Take him out!" booms Gene Layton, an ex-pro football player who is sitting -- 
by design, he said -- behind the ring girls. 
</P>
<P>
But one person at ringside looks bored. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen more excitement at a Broadway musical," said Gordon James, president 
of the Long Beach Civic Light Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Time for the main event: Ray McElroy vs. Robert (Showdown) Carson of San Pedro. 
Both have tassels on their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
There is a flurry of punches in the eighth and final round. Sweat drops fly 
into the first row. 
</P>
<P>
"Comb-in-a-tion, comb-in-a-tion," instructs a fan, his hands cupped around his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
It is over. McElroy wins a unanimous decision. Sonny Ray pulls off McElroy's 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
The fighters leave the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"Champ didn't knock you out, baby," Carson's girlfriend shouts to him. 
</P>
<P>
They both smile. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the ring is being taken down.

JIM MURRAY: REDS' THROW-AWAY WOUND UP A KEEPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trading in baseball is almost a lost art. But even in its heyday, it used to be 
axiomatic that the best trades are often the ones you never make. 
</P>
<P>
This is because the worst ones are so highly visible. And humiliating. They 
haunt the general manager for the rest of his baseball life. 
</P>
<P>
The worst trade in the history of the major leagues is a matter of subjective 
evaluation, but in the hunt has to be the dealing of Frank Robinson to the 
Baltimore Orioles for right-handed pitcher Milt Pappas. A baseball rule of 
thumb is, never trade a pitcher unless you get plenty. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles got plenty. Robinson not only became one of only 13 players in the 
modern history of the game to win the triple crown (batting average, home runs, 
runs batted in), but he was the catalyst in leading Baltimore to a succession 
of pennants, World Series victories and chronic contending position. Robinson 
made the Hall of Fame. Pappas went 46-47. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis appeared to be violating the never-trade-a-pitcher principle when 
they sent right-hander Ernie Broglio to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Lou 
Brock. Broglio was an 18-game winner the year before. But he went 14-31 for his 
career at Chicago and was out of the game in three years. Brock went on to the 
Hall of Fame, set the major league stolen base record and helped the Cardinals 
to several World Series, where he usually batted .400 and set stolen base 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Those trades were bad. But how about trading Grover Cleveland Alexander in his 
prime for -- are you ready? -- Pickles Dillhoefer?! Alex had only won 30 games 
that year and was to win 373. The immortal Pickles, a catcher, went on to bat 
.123, .091 and .213 in his next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
It's a risky business. It used to be the only way a player could travel from 
one club to another. Player movement today is dictated by the player. He goes 
when he wants, where he wants, and he gets the money, not the seller, the club 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
A general manager, however, still has to be nervous approaching a bargaining 
session. Dennis Eckersley went to Oakland for three minor league players three 
years ago -- the immortal David Wilder, Brian Guinn and Mark Leonette. 
Philadelphia got Steve Carlton (and two pennants) for Rick Wise. 
</P>
<P>
The "trade that will help both clubs" exists only in the team's publicity 
handout. The trade that helps neither club is the more likely . 
</P>
<P>
The "throw-ins," i.e., players considered of no importance but put in to 
sweeten the attraction, and the "player to be named later" have sometimes 
enjoyed a significant role. Sid Bream, an afterthought in the deal that sent 
Bill Madlock from Pittsburgh to the Dodgers, is enjoying productive years with 
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Dodger General Manager Fred Claire approached the negotiating table 
with the Cincinnati Reds last summer, he knew he had to keep one hand on his 
wallet and the other on a Bible. The worst thing you can do is make a mistake 
trading with a team not only in your league but in your division -- the team 
you have to beat. He knew what he needed. He wanted another bat in the lineup 
-- Kal Daniels, a natural .300 hitter with good power, was perfect for his 
purposes. He knew what Cincinnati needed -- a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Claire offered Tim Leary, a right-hander of great promise who had one 17-game 
season with the Dodgers but had struggled to achieve consistency much of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds countered they would need something else. The Dodgers threw in Mariano 
Duncan, a sometimes brilliant but erratic shortstop who had trouble hitting the 
major league curveball. When Cincinnati acquiesced, Claire pressed his luck. He 
wondered whether he shouldn't have a throw-in of his own. He got Lenny Harris, 
a good-enough ballplayer but one who found it so difficult to find a spot to 
break in the lineup that he took to wearing four gloves. To stay in the big 
leagues, he found he had to play wherever a spot opened up, either through 
injury or poor play on the part of the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough way to launch a career, but Harris had the perfect temperament for 
it -- uncomplaining, cheerful. A utility infielder has to be like a butler. 
Ready to serve wherever he's needed. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were delighted. On a team where cheerful acceptance is not in 
abundance, Harris was a breath of fresh air. Or at least, fresh attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Jim Gilliam, have the Dodgers had a player who could roam between the 
infield and outfield and play either position with equal skill and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding young man," insists his manager, Tommy Lasorda. "He's a 
Dodger! I platoon him with Mike Sharperson, that's OK. I need him at second 
base, that's OK. We need him in the outfield? Lenny runs out there. When Fred 
Claire called me and said, 'We have a chance to get Lenny Harris,' I said, 'Get 
him!' I remember one game against us, he went after a foul ball and he slammed 
clear into the fence. But he caught it." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels is hitting a predictable -- and satisfactory -- .290 with 19 home runs 
and 62 runs batted in. Tim Leary, after a disappointing season, was traded to 
the New York Yankees, with whom he is having a mediocre year. 
</P>
<P>
But the throw-ins are prospering. Duncan is batting a rarefied .327, almost 100 
points above his lifetime average. 
</P>
<P>
And Harris is hitting a robust .296 after hovering around .300 most of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is even content with his stand-in role. "I try to keep myself ready, 
keep myself concentrated. I play where I'm needed. If they need a leadoff man, 
I hit leadoff. When I knew they wanted me to lead off, I went to Brett Butler 
(of San Francisco) and asked him for some pointers on how to play it. He told 
me what you need is patience." 
</P>
<P>
Harris has that. He is patient, low profile. On a recent evening, he was found 
patiently standing at the fence signing baseballs and gloves for a line of 
young fans. 
</P>
<P>
He won't even bad-mouth a system that has scarcely let him get a full season 
under his belt to learn his trade the only place you can -- on the field. "Oh," 
he says, "Pete (Rose) played me whenever he could, whenever he had a place for 
me. I couldn't complain." 
</P>
<P>
He could have. He just didn't. 
</P>
<P>
A baseball trade is like any other business merger. You have to wait a while 
for the bottom line. So far, Lenny Harris has made the Dodgers look as if 
they've made the best deal since Wally Moon for Gino Cimoli. Or maybe since 
Grover Alexander for Pickles Dillhoefer.

JOHNSON CRITICIZES UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: CONTRARY TO WHAT COACHES SAY, QUARTERBACK SAYS THE BRUINS DECIDED NOT 
TO START HIM MONTHS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lashing out at UCLA's handling of its quarterback situation, former starter 
Bret Johnson said Wednesday that he plans to transfer to another school because 
the Bruin coaches had determined that he would not start this season "no matter 
what" he did in fall practice. 
</P>
<P>
After practice Tuesday morning, Johnson was told by offensive coordinator Homer 
Smith that Jim Bonds was the favored quarterback among the four candidates for 
the position. Johnson decided to leave the team. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said he wasn't convinced that 
Johnson had decided to leave school, but a statement by Johnson left little 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I am part of the fallout from last season (a 3-7-1 record)," said 
Johnson, who started all 11 games for UCLA. "In my three years at UCLA, we've 
had three different offensive coordinators. I would now like to go to a school 
that has stability and can benefit from my style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"Five (assistant) coaches have left UCLA, and now the quarterback has been 
fired. I feel strongly now that this decision was known months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The really unfair thing is they have strung me along and have now left me very 
little time, due to NCAA regulations . . . to find a place where I can compete 
for the job. The lack of forthrightness and not being honest with me is the 
bottom line for my leaving UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Bonds, a junior, stood out above the rest of the quarterbacks 
-- Johnson, Tommy Maddox and Bert Emanuel -- because of the strength of his 
arm. UCLA did not begin fall practice until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he hadn't prejudged the quarterbacks and had been waiting until fall 
to make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to say over and again that the decision would not be based on 
scrimmage," Smith said. "We would make it right away in the fall. We wanted to 
see when they (the quarterbacks) came back, if something separated them." 
</P>
<P>
That separation, in Smith's opinion, was the velocity of Bonds' passes: "Jim 
Bonds' arm is alive. It has more speed." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a sophomore, had a different opinion of why he lost his starting job 
to Bonds, who backed him up in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Following spring practice, I met with Coach Smith and asked him if the 
quarterback position was going to be open in the fall. He assured me that the 
quarterback position had not been decided and there would be open competition 
in the fall," Johnson's statement read. 
</P>
<P>
"The quarterback (Bonds) has been named prior to any competition with pads (in 
scrimmages). My point is, the position was only open to the other quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no problem with being a backup quarterback, but only if I 
were fairly beaten out by another teammate. With the recent decision of 
quarterback, I believe there was a pre-determination that Bret Johnson would 
not start at quarterback, no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, there has been no justifiable reason in the selection of the 
quarterback at UCLA. I do not want to be involved in a quarterback controversy 
every year as is the standard at UCLA. I am a coach's son, and I have been 
taught to keep my mouth shut and go out and earn the job. I haven't been given 
that chance by Coach Smith this year." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he plans to visit several other schools, and it has been reported 
that he is considering Florida State, Penn State and Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules he would have to sit out a year before he could play again, 
leaving him with two years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Donahue had said he planned to meet with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Bret is a tremendous player," Donahue said. "If Bret has decided to leave . . 
. I wish him nothing but success." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue met with Johnson's father, Bob Johnson, Tuesday night on campus. Bob 
Johnson was Bret's coach at El Toro High School in Orange County. Donahue 
wouldn't reveal what was discussed during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to the quarterback selection process, Donahue said he just approved 
of Smith's decision. Smith had two previous terms on the UCLA coaching staff, 
in the early 1970s and from 1980 to 1986, before returning to the school after 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Homer came here to rework the offense," Donahue said. "I have given him the 
latitude to select the offensive players he needs to win. He made a 
recommendation, and I accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue was unhappy about the premature leak of the story that Johnson was 
leaving school and Bonds had become the No. 1 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that he wanted to make the announcement Wednesday that Bonds had 
been named the starting quarterback to ensure a cooling-off period with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want the new quarterback to be so exuberant that he says the wrong 
things, and I didn't want whoever wasn't named to say the wrong things," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Johnson's leaving and Bonds' promotion would disrupt the chemistry of 
the team, Donahue said: "I think any time a quarterback decision is made where 
there is competition, there's controversy involved because people have 
differing opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be any different today than it would be the week of our 
opening game with Oklahoma (on Sept. 8). If Bret has left the team, it's real 
unfortunate and sad and disappointing because he's a wonderful, competitive 
athlete." 
</P>
<P>
As the starting quarterback, Bonds might have to look over his shoulder at his 
competition, namely Maddox, a redshirt freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Johnson would have been the No. 2 quarterback if he hadn't left the 
team, but added: 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fly in the ointment: Tommy Maddox. He's still green, but he does 
things that I marvel at. He's a very talented young man. He has the quickest 
arm on the team and he's the tallest and he throws tall." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starting flanker Scott Miller suffered a broken collarbone in practice 
Wednesday and could be sidelined four to six weeks. Miller, a senior, was 
injured while diving for a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Split end Reggie Moore may move to flanker, with Paul Richardson and Sean 
LaChapelle sharing the the split end position. Or Miller could be replaced by 
redshirt freshman Michael Moore.

SLATER ONLY GETS PROMISE, REJOINS RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to playing football, the Rams are pretty good. When it comes to 
playing hardball, nobody does it better. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Jackie Slater ended his 28-day holdout Wednesday and reported to Rams 
Park. The six-time Pro Bowl selection didn't get his contract renegotiated, 
however. He obviously didn't get the trade he demanded three weeks ago, either. 
And he apparently didn't get the Rams to waive the fines levied against him, 
which could total $42,000 if he was fined the NFL maximum of $1,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, 36, a 14-year veteran who will earn a reported $550,000 this year, was 
seeking a deal that would put him on a level with the league's highest-paid 
offensive linemen. Anthony Munoz of the Cincinnati Bengals, for example, earns 
$875,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Slater apparently got an oral guarantee that he would be better 
compensated in 1991, when he will set a club record for longevity, breaking the 
mark of 15 seasons established by Charlie Cowan, Joe Scibelli and Merlin Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the opportunity to sit down with the organization, and we mutually 
agreed on some things that addressed the problem that I was having, so here I 
am," said Slater, who answered direct questions about his contract and the 
fines by saying, "It's Rams' policy not to renegotiate contracts" and "It's 
Rams' policy not to waive fines." 
</P>
<P>
That much, of course, he knew before he decided to hold out. So why did he 
return? 
</P>
<P>
"We had a meeting of the minds, and everyone concerned feels that my goals are 
realistic, and I should be given the opportunity to obtain them," he said. "We 
agreed on the fact that I will be playing here next year. All the details 
haven't been ironed out, but I'll be here and I'm very pleased with the way the 
Rams ended up handling my situation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Slater said he was "certainly serious" when he requested that the Rams 
trade him. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling was that I was able to play two more years, regardless of where it 
was," he said. "When I felt I wasn't going to be here, I looked at it as an 
opportunity to see what was inside me, to go to a different system at my age, 
be impressive enough to make the club and then start in a different offense. It 
was a challenging thought, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
During the early days of the holdout, Coach John Robinson lashed out at Slater, 
pointing out that Slater was under contract and ought to think about his 
obligations to the team. But Slater said he carried no ill will with him when 
he returned to Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any hard feelings about what was said in the past," he said. 
"Hopefully, this will all be put to rest now and we can concentrate on trying 
to accomplish some of the team goals that we have." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, not surprisingly, was behind that line of reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I irritated and frustrated him," Robinson said. "But I was frustrated 
at the time, too. Relationships between human beings have frustration involved. 
Unfortunately, (our relationships) undergo the scrutiny of the press. Those are 
things you just have to get by." 
</P>
<P>
Slater, who has been working out on his own during the holdout, said he plans 
to play in Saturday night's exhibition against the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Football shape and just what I've been doing are a lot different, though," he 
said. "The next couple of days will tell the story to me about how much I can 
play (Saturday). But I've got two solid weeks of work before the season opener, 
so I'll be ready by then." 
</P>
<P>
While admitting he was angry and very frustrated at times during the past 
month, Slater said he never gave up hope of reaching an agreement with the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always dialogue and there was never a closed ear, on my part or 
theirs. Fortunately, there was always a thread of hope, despite the gloomy 
circumstances that existed at one time. That thread turned into a couple of 
strands and from there into a rope."

MIKE DOWNEY: SEEING THAT INNING WAS DISBELIEVING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chavez, something horrible happened in your ravine. 
</P>
<P>
Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed what happened 
Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium -- and I thought that I had seen just about 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers lost a baseball game, 12-11, because in the ninth inning the other 
side got nine runs. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lasorda, as subdued as ever I have seen him, sat zombie-eyed at his desk 
and incanted: "I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. 
Eleven to one. Eleven to one. I don't believe it. Eleven to three going into 
the ninth inning. I don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall, in the Philadelphia Phillies' clubhouse, ninth-inning hero John 
Kruk, whose three-run pinch-homer tied the score, was as giddy as Lasorda was 
grieved. Lasorda looked thin and sad. Kruk looked hippy and happy. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do was get back to the hotel by midnight, because that's when 
room service closes," Kruk said. 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Roger McDowell was a silly Phillie, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Gee, I wish we'd gotten a couple more runs for a cushion," McDowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, every joke ever made about leaving Dodger games prematurely became 
seriously unfunny. This was a blow from which the 1990 Dodgers might never 
recover. This one made them bluer than blue. 
</P>
<P>
Losing pitcher Tim Crews sat alone in front of his locker, gazing vacantly into 
it, long after the game, after every single teammate had left the premises. He 
looked like a man looking for a future. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitcher Mike Hartley had long since showered, dressed and 
half-listened to the last few innings on the clubhouse radio, where he found 
the whole thing "kind of unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley had had the world's most comfortable lead. You'd have figured the 
Dodgers would protect that lead if Lasorda spent the last couple of innings 
playing only seven men. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had it sewn up," Hartley said. "I'm sure it's not the first time 
it's happened, and it's not going to be the last time. But man, it's still kind 
of unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
As midnight drew near, Dodger radio voice Ross Porter called the entire 
experience "a killer." Then he had a few more minutes to kill, so he took calls 
from listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Some guy from Tustin asked: "What's Lasorda's hometown?" 
</P>
<P>
Presumably too tired or too dazed to wonder why anybody would care about such a 
thing, Porter replied obligingly: "Norristown, Pa." 
</P>
<P>
"And how close is that to Philadelphia?" 
</P>
<P>
"Very close." 
</P>
<P>
And the caller said: "Can you add two and two?" 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of night it was: Kind of unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
For 100 years, the Dodgers have been playing baseball, and everybody from 
Ebbets Field to Elysian Park has been observing the anniversary by 
re-dramatizing the great moments: Robinson's ripping down of the white curtain. 
Gibson's homer. Drysdale's shutouts. Hershiser's shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
But also, the awful moments: Campanella's accident. Roseboro's being hit by the 
bat. Getting swept in the '66 World Series. Pitching to Jack Clark. The 
Campanis thing. 
</P>
<P>
This one was just a plain old August game against the plain old Phillies. More 
than 39,000 customers turned up, hundreds of them toddler tumblers who 
performed before the game. A lot of the kids had to be home early. A lot of the 
adults left because they'd seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe 30,000 of them had split by the ninth when the Phillies hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were practically fooling around. Almost anybody would have been, 
under similar circumstances. They put an all-new lineup on the field. They let 
Fernando Valenzuela pinch-hit. They gave a kid named Dave Walsh the ball and 
told him to get three more outs. 
</P>
<P>
His cushion was eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't get anybody out," Lasorda said later, still staring blankly. 
</P>
<P>
"In shock. I'm in shock." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who needed only to throw strikes, couldn't throw one. By the time Crews 
took over, when the Dodger pitcher needed to be careful, Crews grooved one. 
Saddest of all, the guiltiest party was Jose Offerman, the Shortstop of 
Tomorrow, who made two errors in the ninth. Two days before, he made the most 
spectacular debut, homering in his first turn at bat, catching everything that 
came his way. Two days later, he couldn't handle the simplest grounders. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Porter took one more call: 
</P>
<P>
"I have a suggestion for the Dodgers," the caller said. "Give this Offerman a 
one-way ticket to Albuquerque." 
</P>
<P>
In the best Dodger move of the night, Ross took no more calls.

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office decided that allegations 
against three USC freshman football players involving sexual battery are not 
felony offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The case was referred to the city attorney, said Bruce Campbell, head of the 
county's Child Abuse/Sex Crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office must determine whether allegations by a 22-year-old

NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL PLAYERS DENY REPORT OF RAMPANT STEROID ABUSE

<P>
Notre Dame football players closed ranks behind their boss Wednesday, defending 
Coach Lou Holtz -- and themselves -- from published charges that Holtz 
tolerated widespread steroid abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the guys on this team don't use steroids, and that's all there is to 
it," co-captain Todd Lyght said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Zorich, a senior nose tackle who bench-presses 500 pounds, said former 
Notre Dame player Steve Huffman has a "chip on his shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman wrote a first-person account for Sports Illustrated in which he claims 
steroid use was rampant among Notre Dame players. He claimed Holtz must have 
known and implied the coach tolerated the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz and other university officials denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
But Notre Dame revealed Wednesday that five players have tested positive for 
steroids since 1987 among 466 tests conducted by the university. 
</P>
<P>
The players were disciplined, although athletic director Richard Rosenthal 
refused to say whether they were thrown off the team or expelled from school. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several players say they have never witnessed scenes described by 
Huffman of dozens of steroid bottles and hypodermic needles littering dormitory 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The players also rejected Huffman's claim that Holtz forced athletes to 
practice and play through painful injuries. "Yesterday I was injured and I took 
myself out of practice, and Coach Holtz didn't seem to have any problem with 
that," Lyght said.

BURNS NOT READY TO QUIT

<TEXT>
<P>
DeChon Burns got the word Monday night: Quit football. 
</P>
<P>
But as he ate lunch Tuesday at UC Irvine, the USC sophomore had yet to fully 
accept the recommendation of his doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Projected as a starter at cornerback for the Trojans, Burns was told by 
neurological surgeon Michael Apuzzo that, because of the structure of his 
spinal column, he runs the risk of paralysis if he continues playing. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically said that I have a narrow spinal column, which is hereditary, and 
I have a disk in there that's protruding a little bit in the spinal column, 
which makes it even more narrow than it already is," Burns said. "The 
possibility of paralysis is there if I was to take a blow with my neck being at 
the right angle." 
</P>
<P>
Burns, though, has asked Apuzzo to seek other opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ready to throw in the towel yet," Burns said. "Maybe a lot of other 
people might take this as a sign saying, 'Get out,' but I'm hopeful it's not as 
serious as it seems to be and that these other specialists might see something 
that was overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Burns, 20, called himself "confused" but grateful. 
</P>
<P>
"You never prepare yourself for things in life that are so sudden," he said. 
"So, as far as accepting it, I'm dealing with it, but at the same time, I'm 
kind of hoping I don't have to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably in denial. But whatever the outcome, I think it's for the better 
and God is watching over me. I'm very thankful that I'm able to breathe and 
move my fingers and hands and turn my neck. I'm looking at is as a blessing in 
that it could have been a lot more serious." 
</P>
<P>
A three-sport star at Riverside Rubidoux High School, Burns was injured last 
Thursday when he was hit by reserve fullback Ed Chavez, whose block knocked 
Burns off his feet and onto his back. As Burns landed, his head snapped back 
and "whiplashed off the ground," Coach Larry Smith said.

INNOVATION: A PATENT CASE FOR FINANCIAL INVENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suppose Mike Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert had patented the junk bond. What 
would happen to housing prices if Salomon Bros. had the exclusive right to 
trade mortgage-backed securities? What makes a financial innovation any less 
creative than a new piece of software? 
</P>
<P>
Although too many investment bankers resemble the ego-bloated, empty-suited 
"Masters of the Universe" so artfully skewered in "Bonfire of the Vanities," 
some financial engineers can be as clever and ingenious as their counterparts 
in computing and biotechnology. Financial markets are huge and awash with 
opportunities. The right innovation at the right time can spawn a 
multibillion-dollar market. Synthesize the right security, hybridize for a new 
financial instrument, put a novel twist in that currency swap, and you can make 
millions of dollars in pure profit for your firm. 
</P>
<P>
But where biotechnology companies such as Genentech and software companies such 
as Lotus Development Corp. have been quick to seek intellectual property 
protection for their innovations -- and sue to guarantee them -- most 
commercial and investment banks haven't given the idea a second thought. Texas 
Instruments will collect hundreds of millions of dollars from Japanese 
companies thanks to its basic semiconductor chip patents. You would think the 
folks at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would have had the smarts to patent 
their innovations and reap the royalties from Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The financial service industry "has never focused on patents; they have no 
consciousness or history with patents," says Stephen B. Judlowe, a partner of 
Hopgood, Calimafde, Kalil, Blaustein &amp; Judlowe, a New York law firm 
specializing in intellectual property issues. "Why they haven't done it, I 
certainly have no answer for. The people who manage these sorts of things ought 
to be paying more attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
Judlowe is particularly surprised because he was instrumental in procuring a 
patent a decade ago for Merrill Lynch's extraordinarily successful Cash 
Management Account system. The patent was so broad that other firms, like Dean 
Witter, actually paid Merrill licensing fees for the right to build their own 
CMAs. However, few other financial service firms followed up. The idea of 
protecting their innovations instead of just marketing them was never a 
priority. Investment banks that launched a novel and unobvious security in the 
1980s knew that a competitor would hit the market with a copycat security a few 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
That's going to change. As global competition intensifies, as profit margins 
shrink and as these firms increasingly recognize that innovation is valuable in 
its own right, they will increasingly turn to intellectual property protection 
-- patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc. -- to build barriers to market entry. 
In the same way that patent litigation has been reshaping the semiconductor, 
biotechnology and software industries, we will see intellectual property 
protection alter the global flow of capital. It's inevitable, and it will have 
profound implications for the world's financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
A memo titled "Protecting Innovative Securities: A Competitive Edge," issued 
this month by the Washington law firm Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan, 
blueprints how financial innovators can erect intellectual property thickets to 
guard their new products. Next to the CMA patent, this document is the first 
formal shot across the bow of the financial services sector. If the courts 
offer financial innovations the same protection that they offer, say, a 
biotechnological innovation or a semiconductor chip, then Wall Street and the 
rest of the world's financial markets are potentially in for the biggest set of 
shocks since October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Patents have the potential for causing the greatest reverberations in the 
financial industry," asserts attorney Peter K. Trzyna in the Sutherland memo. 
"Competitors could well find themselves foreclosed from marketing a product or 
a class of products for 17 years, or perhaps could do so only by paying 
royalties under a license. Courts are not timid about damage awards. Injunctive 
relief could require competitors to repurchase securities products to remove 
them from the market." 
</P>
<P>
Trzyna and Judlowe argue that you can patent the process by which a new 
security is made. Let's say the firm has a computer system with special 
software that generates this innovative security. If that process is patented, 
under U.S. law, it would be illegal for a Japanese or European financial 
institution to sell such a security in America -- unless the institution did 
all the paperwork by hand. What's more, that computer system could be patented 
in Japan and Europe. The U.S. financial firm could, technically and legally, 
acquire exclusive rights to its innovation if it so desired. 
</P>
<P>
On a strictly business level, however, what we are likely to see is investment 
banks and commercial banks cross-licensing their innovations around the world. 
And why not? Given the potential sums involved, the risk/reward ratio makes 
sense. What's a few hundred thousand dollars extra when hundreds of millions 
are at stake? 
</P>
<P>
"There can be extraordinary benefits from pushing the envelope," says patent 
attorney Judlowe. "Anyone who is at the threshold of what's permissible makes 
an error if they don't seek out protection. The bottom line is that someone 
spends an awful lot of money developing these new products so if they don't 
spend the incremental money to try and protect it, I think they're making a 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
So what happens if Drexel did hold the junk bond patent? Or Salomon has a 
virtual monopoly on mortgage-backed securities? Injecting intellectual property 
protection would slow the rate of innovation and would ultimately prove to be a 
conservative force. People would be very careful about buying securities issued 
by a monopolist. Conversely, investors might be reluctant to buy securities 
issued by competitors because they wouldn't want the values of their securities 
to be affected by a lawsuit. Investors would no doubt ask to be indemnified. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. firms that have a reputation for innovation would be 
better able to fend off competition from overseas firms that relied on 
imitative strategies and lower costs of capital for their successes. The down 
side, of course, is that we'd have more people in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Financial service companies are under such profitability pressures that they 
would try most anything," says Jon Rotenstreich, president of the financial 
services firm Torchmark. A former Salomon Bros. partner and IBM corporate 
treasurer, Rotenstreich says that "What they should really focus on is 
productivity of basic functions rather than legislate protections for their 
business." 
</P>
<P>
That may be true. This is a spanking new sapling of intellectual property law; 
it's not clear how big it's going to grow. But when you look at what's going on 
in other innovation-intensive industries and then look at the gigantic sums of 
money involved in trading, hedges and swaps every moment of the day, you'd have 
to be a Pollyanna to think that America's lawyers and bankers won't find a way 
to make money together exploring how to protect their intellectual capital.

CBS NEWS PRESIDENT RESIGNS AFTER TWO BELEAGUERED YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS News President David Burke has resigned, ending a two-year reign as the 
embattled head of the troubled news division, CBS executives confirmed late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement about Burke's resignation could come as early as today, sources 
said. The network is expected to name Eric Ober, president of the CBS 
Television Stations division and a former CBS News senior executive, as his 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burke had his authority repeatedly challenged by CBS executives 
outside the news division, sources said his resignation was not due to 
differences with management on issues of budget or philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Burke's relationship with CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A. 
Tisch was said to be increasingly antagonistic, and periodically over the last 
six months rumors flared of Burke's impending resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Why he chose this time to suddenly resign is unclear, but sources speculated 
that Burke, a former aide to ex-Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York and Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), may be planning to re-enter politics. His name has often 
been mentioned in connection with a possible presidential bid by New York Gov. 
Mario Cuomo, a good friend. 
</P>
<P>
Sources did not say exactly when Burke would leave, but several people said he 
is expected to stay on until late September to conclude a public service 
campaign at CBS News that he has spearheaded. That would also give the incoming 
CBS News president time to participate in formulating the division's 1991 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, the No. 2 executive at ABC News before being recruited almost exactly 
two years ago, was seen as a no-nonsense type who ended the incessant leaking 
to the press that had come to characterize the news division. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a decade of wrenching changes in the broadcast industry and increased 
competition in television news have contributed to instability within CBS News. 
The division has had five presidents the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
CBS News was once considered the model network news organization, but years of 
budget cutbacks, mass layoffs and defections have badly tarnished CBS News' 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, Burke had halted the turmoil at CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
He immediately made it known after coming aboard in August, 1988, that any news 
division employee who was caught -- indeed, even suspected -- of leaking 
stories or making unauthorized contacts with the press would be out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
And he set the example himself by turning down virtually all requests for 
interviews, except during official CBS News functions. 
</P>
<P>
Though he helped shore up the news division's public image, and pushed for more 
exhaustive coverage of news events, Burke nonetheless was considered within the 
CBS News organization to be a remote manager who largely delegated day-to-day 
operations to his chief lieutenant, Joseph Peyronnin. 
</P>
<P>
One joke had it that Burke could walk through the halls of the Broadcast 
Center, as CBS News headquarters in New York is known, without being 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Burke may best be remembered as the CBS News president who succeeded in 
teaching anchorman Dan Rather who was boss, CBS insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
Before Burke's arrival, Rather's blessing was frequently needed for management 
changes. That changed under Burke, and some CBS insiders thought that Rather's 
new status was underscored by the fact that the decision on Burke's resignation 
was apparently reached while the anchorman was covering the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Under Burke, CBS News returned to a more hard-edged kind of coverage than had 
existed under the division's previous two presidents -- Howard Stringer, now 
president of CBS Broadcast Group, and Van Gordon Sauter. Still, Burke was 
unable to stop "CBS Evening News' " slide from first to second place in the 
ratings, or develop a new hit news program akin to CBS's "60 Minutes" or ABC's 
"Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Ober, who is expected to succeed Burke, comes into the job with two 
advantages that Burke did not possess. First, he has good relations with the 
inner circle of top CBS executives -- Tisch, Stringer, Senior Vice President 
Jay Kriegel and CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky. And, second, he is 
highly regarded by many inside the news division, where he was a vice president 
of public affairs between 1984 and 1987, overseeing such programs as "60 
Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Whether those advantages are enough to overcome the obstacles ahead remains to 
be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although frequently thought of as a glamorous job that entails such 
responsibilities as defending the First Amendment before Congress, network news 
division presidents today spend most of their time quelling turf wars and 
lobbying parsimonious corporate managers for more money to cover news. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ober will have to show that he can move CBS News, and particularly 
"CBS Evening News," closer to first place -- a difficult task, given that ABC's 
"World News Tonight" has solidified its No. 1 position and, with it, the 
perception that ABC is the best-run network news organization.

JUDGE FORCES FREEZE, DISCLOSURE ON KEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KRENSAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for thrift regulators, a Los Angeles judge Wednesday ordered 
Charles H. Keating Jr., former chief of the failed Irvine-based Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan, to abide by a government action requiring him to disclose his 
personal finances and partially freezing his assets. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling after negotiations between Keating and government attorneys stalled, 
U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson ordered Keating to abide by an 
Office of Thrift Supervision complaint requiring him to disclose his assets 
within five days. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ruling also activates OTS measures barring Keating from 
transferring assets overseas and requiring him to notify the government two 
days before transactions exceeding $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an absolute victory, and we're very pleased," said OTS Director Tim Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson ruled on a suit the Justice Department filed Friday to enforce an Aug. 9 
OTS complaint pursuing the largest restitution claim sought by S&amp;L 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Charging improper use of the thrift's money, OTS wants Keating, chairman of the 
former parent of Lincoln, and five associates to pay $40.9 million in 
restitution for their roles in the failure of the thrift. Keating heads 
American Continental Corp., a Phoenix company undergoing reorganization under 
bankruptcy protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
OTS is seeking the restitution for three transactions involving a Detroit hotel 
in 1985, an American Continental employee stock-option plan and a tangled deal 
in which Lincoln sold desert land to a partnership that used funds borrowed 
from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent failure of Lincoln, seized by federal regulators in April, 1989, 
likely will cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley J. Boland, a spokesman for American Continental and a Keating 
son-in-law, denounced the OTS complaint, calling the agency's action 
"harassment" and "nothing more than a waste of taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
Keating was unavailable for comment Wednesday. Earlier this week one of his 
attorneys characterized the Justice Department action as an ambush by 
government agencies that will yield little benefit while burdening taxpayers 
with huge legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly on the hunt for scalps so that they can create the impression 
that they are handling the crisis, and they're not," said attorney James Ham. 
"They know damn well the guy doesn't have a dime. The lawyers are getting rich 
off it. But nobody else is." 
</P>
<P>
He also portrayed the government's actions as an attempt to derail a bankruptcy 
plan Keating submitted Aug. 10 as part of efforts to reorganize American 
Continental, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's plan is meant to supplant an earlier one filed by American's 
unsecured creditors and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
OTS Director Ryan denied the harassment charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal here is to protect the American taxpayers," he said. "Certainly, I 
would not consider the actions of this agency to be harassment. It's not 
harassment when we're asking this gentleman to return $41 million to this 
institution and ultimately to the American taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, reportedly worth as much as $39 million in 1987, now claims he is 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
During the five years Keating and his family owned the thrift, they funneled 
$34 million to themselves in salaries, stock options and other transactions, 
the government charges.

U.S. OKs Mainframe Sale to Soviets: The Commerce Department granted Control 
Data Corp. an export license to ship the most powerful computers ever sent to 
the Soviet Union from the West, the company said. The six mainframe computers, 
worth a total of $32 million, will be used to analyze safety factors in the 
operation of civilian Soviet nuclear power reactors. The company applied for 
the export license last November and announced the Soviet order a month later.

WASHINGTON POST IN POCKET PHONE VENTURE

Washington Post Co. said Wednesday that it has joined with American Personal 
Communications Inc. to develop a new pocket-sized, wireless telephone service 
for the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland-based AMC is the general partner in the limited partnership, which 
expects to begin testing an experimental phone system by year-end and be fully 
operational by the end of 1991, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the system would allow only one-way, outbound calling in Washington 
and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs, much like pay phones. Such a service is 
in use in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The companies could jointly invest up to $6 million in the testing phase, Post 
spokesman Guyon Knight said. He would not speculate on what the overall 
development cost would be. 
</P>
<P>
The system is one of a number of Federal Communications Commission-sanctioned 
experiments in "personal communications networks" that proponents hope 
eventually will replace existing cellular and wired phone systems, particularly 
in office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
These proponents envision that someday all calls will be made not to locations, 
but to people, wherever they are, who would carry tiny phones with them. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne N. Schelle, AMC's chairman, said these new types of wireless phones are 
expected to be smaller, lighter and cheaper than today's portable cellular 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
"Every member of a family or employee of a business will be able to carry a 
phone in their pocket in the same way they currently carry their keys or 
wallet," Schelle said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The folding phones, which will resemble a travel alarm clock, may be sold for 
as little as $75, AMC says. 
</P>
<P>
Customers would be able to make calls whenever they are in range of 
refrigerator-sized transmitting stations that would link callers with the 
public phone network or to other users of the wireless system. 
</P>
<P>
The system will use digital "spread spectrum" technology that allows a single 
call to switch back and forth continually to whatever frequency is available. 
The low-power radio signals will have ranges of only a few hundred feet, which 
means they will have less tendency to interfere with each other. 
</P>
<P>
This approach should dramatically increase the capacity -- and thus lower the 
costs -- for a personal communications network, compared to today's cellular 
systems, which use more power to operate over longer distances on a relatively 
restricted number of channels. However, the low-power devices do not work well 
in moving automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
AMC got permission from the FCC earlier this year to test the new phone service 
for up to 2,000 users, but the FCC hasn't decided whether to allot precious 
radio airspace to these new services. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said that if the FCC approves full development of the new 
service, it will consider expanding to other U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post Co., whose holdings include the Washington Post newspaper, in 
1983 won a cellular phone franchise with AMC for the Washington-Baltimore area. 
The Post no longer is in that partnership, Knight said.

Pilots Pull Out of Eastern Creditors Committee: The Airline Pilots Assn. said 
it decided to withdraw after the judge hearing the bankruptcy case quashed 
their attempt to subpoena officials of several of Eastern's major creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The union wanted to question the officials about leaks of information during 
the proceedings. The pilots said they acted before the start of a hearing in 
New York on Tuesday on Eastern's request to have the pilots removed from the 
committee. The Miami-based airline had sought to remove the pilots because they 
allegedly disclosed confidential information obtained from the committee.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BILL GOES TO GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE IS THE FIRST IN THE UNITED STATES TO DEFINE ECOLOGICAL 
TERMS USED ON CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND IN ADVERTSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first bill in the nation to try to rein in questionable claims by consumer 
products of environmental friendliness has gone from the California Legislature 
to the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would be the first broad attempt to define the slippery terms 
"recyclable," "recycled," "ozone friendly," "biodegradable" and 
"photodegradable." Consumer products failing to meet the new standards on their 
labels and in their advertising could be prosecuted under existing 
false-advertising statutes. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, AB 3994, would also require manufacturers and distributors of 
products claiming to be "ecologically friendly," "Earth friendly," 
"environmentally lite" and the like, to keep records to justify that claim. 
</P>
<P>
Any member of the public could demand to see a point-by-point written report 
explaining why the distributor or manufacturer is making the claim, whether the 
product has any "significant" adverse environmental impact or violates any 
state, federal or local permits, and what has been done to reduce any impact 
from its production, distribution and disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Violation by a distributor or manufacturer would be considered a misdemeanor 
punishable by up to six months in jail, a $2,500 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
"There is deception in the marketplace preventing the consumer from using their 
dollar to help the environment," said Gordon Hart, a lobbyist for the Sierra 
Club, one of the bill's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Supported also by Californians Against Waste, and carried by Assembly members 
Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont) and Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles), the proposed law is an outgrowth of a fact-finding meeting in St. 
Paul, Minn., last March by attorney generals from eight states. State Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles) carried the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The bill passed the state Senate 29-4 on Friday and the Assembly on Tuesday by 
a 68-1 margin. Aides to Gov. George Deukmejian say he has until Sept. 30 to 
sign or veto the measure. The law would go into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although little organized opposition to the bill has yet to appear, Maureen 
Frisch, public affairs manager for Simpson Paper Co. in San Francisco, 
expressed worries about the measure Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about the definitions in the bill," Frisch said. "We 
think the definitions might be premature." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission is considering its own definitions for 
environmental advertising claims as is the California Integrated Waste 
Management Board (formerly the State Solid Waste Management Board). 
</P>
<P>
Further, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency already has standards for 
products using recycled material. Simpson manufactures recycled papers, many of 
which already conform to EPA guidelines, but the company complained about 
having to meet varying state standards. 
</P>
<P>
"We need national guidelines that we can all live with as opposed to piecemeal 
ones," Frisch said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the FTC will (adopt) our rules," said the Sierra Club's 
Hart, "because we think they're reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a meeting Monday in San Diego, the Council of State Governments 
proposed a 13-state Western coalition to jointly develop their own definitions 
for "green" labeling.

Stotler &amp; Co. Charged: The Securities and Exchange Commission filed 
administrative charges against Stotler &amp; Co., a securities subsidiary of 
the company once headed by former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten 
(Cash) Mahlmann. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC accused Chicago-based Stotler of selling or trying to sell government 
securities without being a member of a registered securities association, such 
as the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. The three-page order called for a 
public hearing before an administrative law judge. A woman who declined to 
identify herself when she answered the telephone at Stotler's offices in 
Chicago said no one was available to answer questions about the charges from a 
reporter.

OPEC WILL MEET TO DISCUSS OIL OUTPUT, VENEZUELA SAYS

Venezuelan Energy Minister Celestino Armas said Wednesday that all 13 OPEC 
members may meet Sunday in Vienna in response to the call from Saudi Arabia for 
an urgent meeting to discuss possible oil production increases. 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly what we're going to have is a consultative meeting of the 13 members" 
of the cartel, Armas told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting would be held Sunday in Vienna, but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have called for an urgent meeting of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss the possibility of 
increasing output because of the sharp rise in world prices. 
</P>
<P>
A world embargo of Iraq and Kuwait, imposed after Iraq overran its small 
neighbor Aug. 2, has taken 4 million barrels of oil daily off world markets. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela want to make up most of that through increased 
production but hope to get OPEC approval to do it. Officials from both nations 
have said that although they prefer an OPEC agreement, they will raise their 
outputs if the organization fails to meet. 
</P>
<P>
Under bylaws of the cartel, seven of the 13 member nations must approve before 
a meeting can be called. But it takes a quorum of 10 to pass any resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez has said that Ecuador, Kuwait, the 
United Arab Emirates and Qatar have backed the special meeting, along with 
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Only Iran is categorically opposed, he has said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez has said that Venezuela could increase its production by 500,000 barrels 
per day above the country's production quota of 1.945 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said Monday that production increases are vital to keeping world oil 
prices relatively stable and preventing them from shooting higher and 
potentially hurting developing nations.

OIL PRICES CLIMB ABOVE $30 BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil surged above $31 a barrel on Wednesday, leapfrogging the $30 price that had 
stood for years as a psychological barrier between the oil price shocks of the 
late 1970s and the more recent era of cheap energy. 
</P>
<P>
The latest leap in prices was not driven by any dramatic new events or change 
in oil supplies but by a continuation of the panicky psychology that has 
pervaded the oil markets since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a long siege in the Middle East gave oil experts little 
reason to think that prices will fall any time soon. And they said that even 
minor disruptions in the movement of oil around the globe could drive prices 
far higher. 
</P>
<P>
"With the continued possibility of combat, the upside potential is a long way 
from where prices are today," said John Redpath, oil analyst at Energy Security 
Analysis in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a 42-gallon barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumped by 
$2.51 to $31.22, the highest level in nearly five years. The price is that 
fetched by a contract traded Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange for 
delivery of crude oil in October. 
</P>
<P>
Futures contracts for gasoline also were up sharply, climbing nearly 3 cents to 
$1.042 a gallon for unleaded regular. In normal markets, that price would 
eventually mean $1.50 to $1.60 at the pump, industry spokesmen said, once 
taxes, transportation and profits are added. Retail prices peaked in 1981 at 
about $1.45 a gallon, but industry spokesmen pointed out that, adjusted for 
inflation, that would be about $2 a gallon in 1990 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Traders blamed Wednesday's sharp increases on fresh signs of disarray in the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and news that Saudi Arabian oil 
bound for Japan had been diverted to serve as jet fuel for the U.S. and Saudi 
military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
Neither event signaled a new assessment of how much oil will be available to 
meet world demand. In fact, the latest crude oil and gasoline inventory report 
Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute was more favorable than expected. 
</P>
<P>
But nervousness in Japan over the diverted oil cargoes drove prices up 
dramatically in Tokyo, then in London and New York. Traders said that 
Wednesday's press conference by President Bush didn't help, even though there 
was no major news. 
</P>
<P>
"You add the continuing fears that we could have the destruction of the oil 
fields in Saudi Arabia, and people just keep buying and buying," said Peter 
Beutel, a trader at Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. "Every time Bush gets on 
TV, it seems like it heightens the tension." 
</P>
<P>
At $31, crude oil prices have virtually doubled since mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
The $30 barrier is deemed important because it was the rough starting point for 
a steep collapse that began in November, 1985, and bottomed out six months 
later at $9 a barrel. Since then, prices have bounced between $14 and $20, far 
below the levels that ravaged the world economy in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Even Wednesday's price was moderate compared to the oil-shock years. Adjusted 
for inflation, the price of oil would have to reach about $35 a barrel to be 
comparable to the 1985 level. And, to match the peak of $37 reached in 1981, 
oil today would have to hit about $50 a barrel, Tom Burns, head of the economic 
staff at Chevron Corp., estimated. 
</P>
<P>
"It still is cheaper" than it was in 1985, Burns said, "but we're getting 
close. There wasn't that much inflation in the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
One reason that oil traders are so jumpy is that promises by OPEC members Saudi 
Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates to increase oil output -- to 
make up for oil lost from Iraq and Kuwait -- remain clouded by uncertainty and 
OPEC politics. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Redpath said that, if the 4.2 million barrels of oil a day from Iraq 
and Kuwait -- barred from the market by a worldwide embargo -- is not made up 
somewhere else, the reserve of world crude oil supplies that existed at the 
time of the invasion will be worked off by about Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
He said another factor in Wednesday's big price jump was that it was the first 
day on which traders considered October -- instead of September -- to be the 
"near-term month," the main focus of contract trades on the mercantile 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Redpath said: "The longer out you look, the worse the situation 
appears." 
</P>
<P>
By October, fall and winter will add their own uncertainties to the market. 
They include the threat of hurricanes in the U.S. Oil Patch states and storms 
in the North Sea oil-production areas, both of which could interrupt 
production, and cold spells, which can drive up oil prices even in normal 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no good time for this sort of thing to happen, but going into 
wintertime is one of the less desirable," Burns said.

California's home front is mobilizing on a scale not seen since the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of military reservists are bracing -- some hopefully, some warily -- 
for a possible call to duty by their commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and pray this will be successfully resolved in a peaceful manner. But 
if that's not to be, I hope to be part of the alternate approach," said Los 
Angeles police Capt. Keith Bushey, who also holds the rank of lieutenant 
colonel in the Marine Corps reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, veterans of the anti-war movement in the 1960s are raising their 
voices -- and organizing -- against the United States' strong military response 
to the latest Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't belong in Vietnam . . . and we don't belong over there," said Robert 
Elias, who is helping organize a march to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a 
massive demonstration in East Los Angeles that was aimed in part against the 
war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In a world that wearily celebrated the end of the Cold War, the sudden prospect 
of major combat in the Middle East has been felt with a dizzying impact in 
Southern California. Some people here are eager to fight, some are eager to 
protest -- and many are bewildered by it all. 
</P>
<P>
The children of military personnel already deployed in Saudi Arabia ask 
troubling questions of their teachers. Reserve forces faced with calls to 
military duty worry not just about their own lives and the effect on their 
families, but also the disruption of careers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's decision to mobilize 40,000 reserve forces -- and perhaps as 
many as 150,000 -- has brought the crisis closer to home. Medical personnel and 
cargo handlers represent the first wave; it is unclear who else may go. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife was crying last night," said Mark Little of Orange, a 34-year-old 
communications specialist with the California Air National Guard. "She's afraid 
I'll be called up and sent not just to another country, but to the crisis zone 
-- and not for a week or a month, but six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell her I won't be called. . . . I try to sound positive, but I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
If more reservists are called, civilian employers wonder how they will make do 
without them. Hospitals will lose doctors and, in a worst-case scenario, the 
city of Los Angeles could lose more than 400 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can anticipate . . . that there may be some hospitals that are going to 
find themselves short of some (medical) residents," said Dr. James Todd, 
executive vice president of the American Medical Assn. Todd said older, 
supervising doctors would have to take up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
More than 18,000 physicians in the United States are in the reserves; 7,500 of 
them could be called under the Bush Administration's plan. There are 6,540 
dentists and 25,886 nurses; of those, 2,458 dentists and 13,584 nurses could be 
called. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, hospital officials throughout Southern California predicted that 
the call-up would not significantly impair their ability to provide services. 
Enough medical professionals will be left behind to fill the gaps, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"There just aren't that many physicians from California in the reserves any 
more," said David Langness of the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
Langness suggested poorer communities may be hardest hit because many 
physicians from lower-income areas signed up for the reserves in return for 
financial support in medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Already the impact is being felt at the Naval Hospital San Diego, also known as 
Balboa Hospital. The shipping out of active-duty medical personnel has forced a 
50% reduction in inpatient surgical services and a 20% reduction in outpatient 
services, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, H. Sam Samuelson, said reservists who were putting in time at 
the hospital in recent weeks have been asked to stay on to help out, and more 
are likely to be called in four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He said the reservists likely to be called up in the coming weeks probably will 
not report to. 
</P>
<P>
At the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Los Angeles, about 80 members of 
the 3,200-person staff are in the reserves. "I personally, at this point, feel 
there would be minimal impact," Henry Maar, chief of personnel, said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies -- which include many retired military personnel in 
their ranks -- also may be forced to cover for large numbers of reservists. The 
8,400-member Los Angeles Police Department includes 450 reservists and the 
11,000-member Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has 150, spokesmen for 
those agencies said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone anticipates all active reserves would be called up, but 
whatever happens, we'd absorb it," said police Cmdr. William Booth. "The police 
chief is a strong supporter of the reserves, and that means supporting them 
when they're needed, not just when they aren't." 
</P>
<P>
While some reservists know they will go, most wait for the call. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a clue if we're going to activate or not," said police Capt. 
Bushey. He commands about 250 officers at the Los Angeles Northeast Division, 
as well as a similar number in a Marine Corps reserve unit based in Long Beach 
that specializes in coordinating air and naval gunfire support for infantry 
units. 
</P>
<P>
"Like all Marine units, we're well-trained, prepared, highly motivated and 
determined to do the best job possible if the opportunity arises," Bushey said. 
</P>
<P>
Many career-minded police officers "are praying to Allah that I'll be called. 
Then they'll all get moved up a notch," Bushey added, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Many reservists, however, see war as a bad career move. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians with thriving practices -- from orthopedics to obstetrics -- 
suddenly find themselves facing the prospect of an indefinite tour of duty, 
proably not in the Mideast but as "backfill" in military hospitals throughout 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Albert Kapstrom, a 56-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist at a health 
maintenance organization in Los Angeles, conceded he was feeling a bit 
frightened. "I've lived a good life, I've been married 32 years, I have five 
children," he mused. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about a lot of things," said Kapstrom, a colonel and commander in the 
Air National Guard. "I think about the irrationality of the people who have put 
themselves against our country. I think about the loneliness that goes with 
separation from family. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder now, when those individuals in the unit would turn to me for nurture, 
would I be strong enough to give them the strength they need when I would be 
laboring under the same stresses?" 
</P>
<P>
Another doctor in the reserves, Constante U. Abaya of Oxnard, said he will have 
to shut down his practice, fire two employees and take a drastic pay cut if he 
is activated. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, he has two sons in college. "I just signed a lease for my boy's 
apartment at USC," Abaya said with a rueful chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I did not have these responsibilities, I would probably be the first to 
volunteer," added Abaya, who has been in the reserves for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Judson Schoendorf, a 48-year-old allergist in Long Beach who is chief 
executive officer of a 60-physician medical group, and a Navy reserve captain, 
said he fully intends to serve if called, but observed that the threat of war 
could have come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
His business, for example, is involved in complex legal negotiations over the 
sale of a building that has landmark status. And in the medical practice, 
Schoendorf is the only allergist, juggling as many as 80 allergy patients a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is his personal life. "What do I do with pets?" he wondered. 
"Just because I'm single doesn't mean I don't have any obligations in the 
world. I have a parrot and a pond full of koi. What do I do with those? Let 
them die just because I'm going?" 
</P>
<P>
Marine reservist Graham Morse, 31, of Santa Monica, is a sheet-metal contractor 
in civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a ton of business," Morse said. "I'm wondering if I'm going to be 
able to get back to my business. But if it comes down to the wire, it's got to 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Clifton Uyematsu, 45, an Anaheim resident who works as a retail store 
designer for Hallmark, is acting commander of the 56th Aerial Port Squadron at 
the 445th Military Airlift Wing, an Air Force reserve unit of 3,300 at Norton 
Air Force Base in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
His unit's job is to load passengers and cargo on planes, a duty that the 
Pentagon on Wednesday said needs filling by reserves. So he figures he will go. 
</P>
<P>
"As a civilian," he said, "I think it's going to cause some inconvenience 
because now our routine has been disrupted. But for the most part, I think our 
particular squadron has been focused on the training that prepares us for a 
situation like this." 
</P>
<P>
His wife and two sons, 19 and 17, "would rather have me stay home, but they 
support the program. They know leaving has always been a possibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Emry, head of emergency nursing at San Clemente General Hospital, said 
she recently signed up for the reserves, with the hope that she would be called 
to active duty. But she said she does not expect to be called until October. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to go since I got out of nurses' training," Emry said 
Wednesday. "But then I got married and had kids. . . . Now I can go have that 
adventure and excitement and not worry. There are no kids to raise and the 
house is taken care of -- you know, all the things you would normally worry 
about if you were going. And I think I can share a lot of experience." 
</P>
<P>
The eagerness with which some reservists greeted the prospect of being called 
up was also reflected in recruiting offices and reserve training centers. Phone 
inquires have increased from would-be volunteers, but most never call back 
after hearing the requirements, such as a high school education and basic 
training, recruiters say. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think they can walk in and leave the next day," said Petty 
Officer 1st Class Tom Richard at the Navy recruiting office in East Los 
Angeles. "You always have the gung-ho people who come out of the woodwork and 
say they're ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
The threat of actual war in the Persian Gulf also has not scared off recruits, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not had anybody say, 'Kiss my royal posterior, I'm not going over 
there,' " Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Gunnery Sgt. Stephen Hernandez said the Encino training center has 
received a large number of calls lately from former servicemen who want to join 
up again. One call even came from a World War II veteran. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to come back in. We've been giving out recruiters' (phone) 
numbers like crazy," Hernandez said. "There's so much support out there, I 
can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
But anti-war sentiment already is visible. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 anti-war activists gathered inside the church of St. 
Augustine-by-the-Sea in Santa Monica on Wednesday to rally against the U.S. 
military buildup. Meanwhile, several counter-demonstrators protested outside 
and burned the Iraqi flag.

U.S. AGAIN LOOKS TO RESERVISTS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE 11TH TIME SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II, NATIONAL GUARD AND OTHER UNITS 
ARE BEING CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY. THE TRADITION DATES TO THE REVOLUTION.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, it had the best-armed, 
best-trained military reserve volunteer force in the country's history, but a 
chagrined President Woodrow Wilson could find no authority for ordering the men 
to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
To his embarrassment and theirs, he was forced to draft them all, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
Since that great conflict was viewed for years as the "War to End All Wars," 
nothing was done about bolstering the President's authority until 1933. That 
year, Congress created the National Guard of the United States, enabling him to 
mobilize state guard units en masse. 
</P>
<P>
For the 11th time since the end of World War II, guard and military reserve 
units across the country are being called to active duty, renewing the 
citizen-soldier tradition that reaches back to the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Girding for possible combat in the Middle East, President Bush has summoned 
them with extraordinary dispatch because the country's regular all-volunteer 
armed forces now rely more heavily upon the reservists than they have at any 
time since Wilson's day, seven decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Bush's decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia, flying tankers 
from the Tennessee Air National Guard's 134th Air Refueling Group took off from 
a base outside Knoxville to refuel huge transports carrying the first American 
paratroopers to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
They were joined by other KC-135 tankers from Michigan, Illinois, New Jersey 
and other states to help fuel history's mightiest airlift. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers across a vast range of specialties followed the tanker crews to 
active duty, and combat units are among those expected to get their call soon. 
</P>
<P>
Experts expect that the Georgia National Guard's 48th Mechanized Infantry 
Brigade and Mississippi's 155th Armored Brigade will be ordered to Saudi Arabia 
to fill out the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division and the 1st Cavalry Division, 
already sent. 
</P>
<P>
The civilians who are being so rapidly brought under arms "are probably as 
prepared as they have ever been in our history," says Col. Harry Summers, a 
retired officer and military historian. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Army, Navy and Air Force reserves and the National Guard may 
wear similar uniforms, but the organizations are quite different in structure 
and character. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve units are essentially subsidiaries of their respective armed 
services. The National Guard units are modern-day counterparts of the old state 
militias, directly accountable to the governors of their respective states, yet 
linked to the national armed forces. Each organization has its own command 
structure and recruiting activities. 
</P>
<P>
In times past, these citizen-soldiers have gone off to war under circumstances 
even more daunting than the current standoff with the Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago next week, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the first 
National Guard units to active duty more than three months before the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be a phased call-up, under the guise of a year's training, because 
the country was without the weapons needed to arm them, barracks needed to 
house them and the trucks that were needed to move them. The first to go were 
members of the 44th Division from New Mexico and the 45th Division from 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
In the ranks of the 44th was a young private named Bill Mauldin, whose cartoon 
characters, Willie and Joe, would later portray the life of the World War II 
dogface in the armed forces newspaper Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, 8,000 citizen-soldiers were 
already on duty. By some accounts, it was a National Guard anti-aircraft outfit 
from New Mexico that fired the first American shots of World War II -- when 
Japanese Zeros swept down on the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Pacific fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Before the war was over, 18 of the guardsmen who had been summoned by the 
President had won the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
John W. Vessey Jr., who entered the conflict as a private in the Minnesota 
National Guard, was one of many who won battlefield commissions. When he 
returned to civilian life, it was nearly four decades later and he had become 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Reservists had no time to prepare for Korea in 1950. Part-time Marines yet to 
enjoy the initiation of boot camp were called to duty within days of North 
Korea's rampage across the 38th Parallel. 
</P>
<P>
The greenest of them were pulled out of ranks at California's Camp Pendleton 
and shipped off for their basic training, while others -- hardly more seasoned 
-- sailed for the war, taking target practice at floating sea bags. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after some them had been plowing corn in Iowa, they waded ashore at 
Inchon to help pull off one of the tactical masterpieces of modern military 
history, the amphibious landing that initially turned the tide in the Korean 
War. 
</P>
<P>
As deeply engrained as the citizen-soldier is in American tradition, the 
National Guard and reserves have at times been fiercely controversial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Some Army historians have criticized the National Guard for being slow to 
respond in Korea, but historian Summers argues, to the contrary, that "we would 
have lost the war in Korea at the outset if we had not been able to mobilize 
the guard and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
During that war, however, no less a critic than Charles Wilson, President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, suggested that reservists and 
guardsmen were draft dodgers. Such charges flew again during Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
And when Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle was nominated for the vice presidency in 1988, 
his service in the Indiana National Guard during Vietnam was viewed as a 
monumental political liability. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was indeed an unhappy period in the saga of the American 
citizen-soldier, and it continues to be debated. In one of his more 
controversial decisions in managing the conflict, President Lyndon B. Johnson 
chose to keep the reserves at home while sending draftees to fight in Asia. 
Reserve ranks were filled and long lines of young men waited for vacancies 
during the Vietnam years. 
</P>
<P>
Among Johnson's reasons was strong advice from Defense Secretary Robert S. 
McNamara, who reminded him that sending the reserves to Indochina would leave 
the country without a backup force to respond if the Soviet Union made a move 
on Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the rationale, the decision did nothing for the image of the reservist 
as a modern-day Minuteman. 
</P>
<P>
When three National Guard combat units were finally mobilized in May of 1968, 
they were left at Ft. Lewis, Wash., and Ft. Shafter, Hawaii, for a full year, 
then released without ever going to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The final blow for the guard's image during the Vietnam experience came in May, 
1970, when Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire on anti-war demonstrators on the 
campus of Kent State University, killing four of them. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the end, not even the unhappy experience of the Vietnam years 
permanently damaged the role of the citizen-soldier. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the worst thing an honest-to-goodness draft dodger could 
do would be (to) join the National Guard or the reserves where there is the 
real potential to be called to combat duty," says retired Maj. Gen. Bruce 
Jacobs, a onetime New York advertising man and New Jersey guardsman, who 
volunteered for Vietnam and remained on active duty. "I could think of much 
better ways to hide out if I wanted to hide out." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Vietnam War, rather than diminishing the role of the 
citizen-soldier, enhanced it, because it led the nation to abandon the draft 
and turn to a slimmed-down all-volunteer active force, which depends on the 
reserves for vital support. Regular Army forces are no longer prepared to fight 
even a small war without heavy involvement by reservists. 
</P>
<P>
But in peacetime, the guards also have a state role. Their mobilizations this 
century come in addition to state service in a range of crises, from quelling 
urban riots to fighting fires and floods or helping to clean up after such 
natural disasters. Hence, guard units have developed a sense of state identity 
and pride that matches their federal service. 
</P>
<P>
There are historical reasons that so-called "weekend warriors" have remained an 
integral part of the United States' national security establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"Going back to Colonial times, there was a desperate fear of standing armies," 
says John K. Mahon, a Florida historian, author and expert on reserve forces. 
"History had shown that standing armies had overturned liberal governments." 
</P>
<P>
"And they are expensive. The United States in its youth was never willing to 
spend that money," Mahon adds. "With two major moats on either side of us, the 
U.S. could have a cheap defense, which is what they wanted. Until after World 
War II, that concept prevailed." Reservists today, while not so costly as 
standing armies, are hardly inexpensive. Because their major combat units are 
destined to "round out" active-duty forces, they use comparable equipment, not 
outdated hand-me-downs. 
</P>
<P>
According to Summers, the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve 
constitute the fifth-largest Air Force in the world. The Army National Guard 
and Army reserve make up the world's 11th-largest Army. 
</P>
<P>
Fully 90% of the aeromedical evacuation units in the armed forces are reserve 
units. Of perhaps more interest in the Middle East, 50 of the Army's 53 
water-supply units are made up of reservists. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve unit's closer relationship with active-duty military forces during 
this era of high-tech warfare has made the role of the citizen-soldier more 
complex and demanding than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"You can now count the guard and reserves as an essential part of any 
expeditionary force used by the United States," Mahon says. "They've trained 
all over the world, and when called they'll do a credible job. But the strain 
on citizen-soldiers becomes greater and greater. It makes it hard to maintain 
civilian careers. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is now jerked out of his livelihood to be sent over there to Saudi 
Arabia for up to two years, that is a serious problem for a man with a family," 
he says. "But under the laws and customs, that's what he has to do -- he has to 
respond to this summons."

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Citizen soldiers -- A Times report on the role of the citizen-soldier in 
America neglected to report that 967 members of the California Army National 
Guard were called to active duty for the Vietnam War in 1968. The 40th Aviation 
Company of Long Beach was dispatched to Scofield Barracks in Hawaii, and the 
1st Squadron of the 18th Armored Cavalry of Burbank was assigned to Ft. Lewis, 
Wash. Many members of the units went on to Vietnam to fill out units already 
deployed in the conflict. Army National Guard units from several other states 
also were activated and sent to Vietnam as individual units. FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Guard call-up -- An article on citizen-soldiers Aug. 23 misstated facts 
regarding the first call-up of the National Guard under the National 
Conscription Act of 1940. The first Guard unit called to active duty -- 15 
months before the attack on Pearl Harbor -- was the 251st Coast Artillery 
Regiment from Southern California, which was sent to Hawaii in November, 1940, 
and later became the first Guard unit to fire shots in World War II.

All Todd Gardner ever wanted was to wear the uniform of a Los Angeles police 
officer. And, after working as a cop in Aurora, Colo., and San Diego, his dream 
came true in March when he was accepted into the Los Angeles Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
The only other thing close to his heart was his wife, Lisa, but that 
passion-turned-obsession cost him his future as a Los Angeles police officer, 
left him wounded by three bullets fired by a Denver-area police officer and 
landed him in a Denver jail in lieu of $1-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Los Angeles Police Department had accepted Gardner, 28, as a 
recruit, he was shot after a bizarre rampage this summer in which he allegedly 
assaulted and kidnaped his estranged wife. The incident followed other domestic 
troubles, and Colorado police said that Gardner, who had repeatedly threatened 
to commit suicide, tricked the police officer into shooting him by pretending 
to have a gun. 
</P>
<P>
These events have raised questions about the accuracy of psychological 
evaluations and background investigations of Los Angeles Police Department 
recruits, especially since Gardner appeared in a Denver courtroom Monday and 
pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first such occurrence that I'm aware of where someone who was 
accepted into the academy had what appears to be such an emotional breakdown," 
said Sheldon Kay, chief police psychologist for the city, who has interviewed 
thousands of recruits in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
But what deeply troubles Kay and Police Department officials is that Gardner 
had begun displaying a dark side as early as last September, when he threatened 
to kill himself and police officers in Colorado -- all long before he was sworn 
in at the Los Angeles Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to look into this situation and into his file and see what, if 
anything, we might have overlooked that could have been an indicator to the 
difficulties he was going through," Kay said Wednesday. "In fact, it certainly 
is worth evaluating and investigating whether there is something in the process 
itself that resulted in this individual getting through us." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner was shot on June 23, five days after he quit the Los Angeles Police 
Academy. In that incident, he allegedly kidnaped his wife, led police on a 
chase through two Denver suburbs and then pretended to pull a handgun in what 
authorities describe as a twisted suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably a couple of police departments with egg on their face over 
this," said Matt Rippy, a detective in the Denver suburb of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's insane, there's good reason to think he should have been washed out of 
the Los Angeles recruitment program, because anybody capable of doing what he 
did could have been identified by police testing," Rippy added. "I mean, I 
can't imagine what L.A. must be thinking. Like, 'How did he get past us?' 
Pretty wild, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth, the department's chief spokesman, 
acknowledged that Gardner turned into an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we fail miserably," Booth said of the officer selection process. 
"But we do our darndest to get the perfect candidate. We have a lot of other 
systems in place, especially our disciplinary system, to catch this sort of 
thing. But this time we failed." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner could not be reached for an interview. His attorney, Bob Ransome, said 
he wants to obtain copies of Gardner's psychological test results to see how 
the department could have passed his client. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner was described by his Police Academy superiors as an overachiever. He 
began his police work as an officer in Aurora, Colo., another Denver suburb, 
where he worked from 1984 to 1986. He later left for a yearlong stint with the 
San Diego Police Department, then returned to Aurora for a second tour of duty 
as a member of its elite police gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very nice, young, professional officer," recalled Mary Schumacher, an 
Aurora police spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
After his marriage began to unravel, Gardner left his wife and two young 
children -- a boy and a girl -- and moved to Los Angeles. He was accepted into 
the Los Angeles Police Academy on March 26, one of 90 recruits. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Gardner underwent a series of complicated, detailed 
examinations, tests of his physical agility and mental stability. The final 
phase of testing involves an extensive psychological evaluation designed to 
reveal any hidden mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kay, the police psychologist, said that the tests should flag personality 
faults, such as impatience or anger, as well as more serious problems, such as 
depression, paranoia and schizophrenia. He said that Gardner also was 
interviewed by a police psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Of approximately 3,000 candidates who take the psychological tests each year, 
15% to 20% "wash out," he said. Gardner passed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good recruit," said Gardner's academy drill instructor, Jerry Stokes. 
"He made good grades. He was one of the people who was in contention for a 
leadership spot, maybe a squad leader." 
</P>
<P>
Added Sgt. Jim McNair, the academy officer in charge of recruiting: "He blended 
in. He fit in. Normally, they come to my attention when they're in the screw-up 
category, and he wasn't one of those." 
</P>
<P>
But what the police and psychologists in Los Angeles had already missed was an 
incident that occurred last year. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Police Detective John Marx said that on Sept. 16 officers were 
called to the Gardner home when Lisa reported that her husband had left the 
house with several guns and threatened to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time," Marx said, "he also allegedly threatened to violently confront 
any police officers if she ever called them." No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents continued, officials said, even as Gardner entered the academy 
and was given a graduation date of Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in early June, Westminster police were summoned back to the Gardner home, 
where Lisa had changed the locks to keep out her husband. Authorities said that 
Gardner was arrested on suspicion of various offenses, including burglary, 
theft, criminal trespassing, carrying a concealed weapon and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In one episode, police said, Gardner waved a .38-caliber revolver in the air 
and fought with police who were trying to subdue him at the home. 
</P>
<P>
"We arrested him on the spot during one of the burglaries," Detective Rippy 
said. "He kicked in a front door and then he wouldn't let our officers inside." 
</P>
<P>
On June 18, Gardner walked up to his academy supervisors and resigned. "He just 
indicated he had some personal problems he had to tend to back in Colorado," 
Sgt. McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, Westminster police answered a report that Lisa was being 
abducted from her front yard. Officer Keith Henry said he arrived to see 
Gardner driving off with his wife, and began pursuit. The chase ended in nearby 
Arvada when Gardner bolted from the car, turned and faced Henry. 
</P>
<P>
Arvada Police Sgt. Merle Westling said that Gardner "challenged the officer and 
told him he had a gun and was going to use it." He said that Gardner reached 
toward the back of his waistband, as if grabbing for a gun, then began to 
slowly bring his hand back around. Henry fired three times, wounding Gardner in 
the stomach, hip and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, it turned out, was unarmed. The local grand jury ruled that the 
shooting was justified because Henry could not have known that Gardner was 
unarmed, said Brian Terrett, spokesman for the Jefferson County district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Some police officials believe that Gardner was acting out a death wish. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew all the buttons to push, and he pushed all those buttons," Rippy said. 
</P>
<P>
"All he ever said he wanted to be was a Los Angeles cop, a big-city Los Angeles 
cop," added Rippy, who interviewed Gardner at the hospital. "And I felt like I 
was talking with a cop, not an ex-cop, even though he was in a hospital all 
shot up. 
</P>
<P>
"He just seemed to me like another cop with a lot of problems."

CANADA TELLS ARTIST TO GROUND HIS GEESE

<P>
An Ontario artist who taught Canada geese to fly in formation with ultralight 
aircraft has found his wings clipped by the Canadian Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife officials say that, if Bill Lishman does not sign an agreement to stop 
taking geese and other waterfowl up into the air lanes, they will confiscate 
his 18 geese. They gave him until Friday to sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to let him keep his birds as long as he keeps them under wire," 
said Joe Carreiro, the service's chief of wildlife conservation and 
environmental quality. "If he lets them fly, he loses them." 
</P>
<P>
Lishman and a colleague, Canadian nature-lover Bill Carrick, were the subject 
of a story in The Times last May. After their success with geese, the two had 
hoped to use ultralight aircraft to teach rare trumpeter swans to migrate south 
for the winter, something trumpeters are believed to have done once but which 
they ceased doing after the arrival of Europeans and gunpowder in North America 
nearly wiped them out. The Wildlife Service has already confiscated a flock of 
hybrid swans that the men were keeping on a lake outside Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Carreiro said Lishman and Carrick had imported swan eggs from the United States 
without the proper papers. He said also that, by flying the geese from one 
place to another, Lishman might muddy the genes of the 35 known subvarieties of 
Canada geese in North America. In addition, Carreiro said that, because the 
geese were "imprinted" on Lishman and his ultralight, they would never lead 
normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the future of these birds?" he asked. "They won't even breed." 
</P>
<P>
Lishman said he did get egg import permits from Canada but had failed to get 
the corresponding egg export permits from the United States. He denied that by 
flying with the geese he was introducing them into new habitats. "They return 
with me, and I put them back in the cage each time," he said. As for the 
question of breeding, he said some of his geese had flown south for the winter 
and returned with "their boyfriends." 
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian Wildlife Service's nose is out of joint because they think we 
didn't consult with them soon enough," he said. "I think they just got jealous 
about the whole thing. We're stealing their glory; that's the way it seems to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid confiscation of his geese, Lishman said he plans to have moved the 
birds by Friday to an undisclosed marshland where the owner has a valid 
avicultural permit.

100 KILLED IN DAY OF BLACK TOWNSHIP FIGHTING; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: LEADERS' PLEAS FOR CALM ARE MET WITH NEW ACCUSATIONS. THE FEUDING 
HAS TAKEN MORE THAN 500 LIVES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pleas for peace from white and black leaders went unheeded Wednesday as 100 
more black South Africans were stabbed, hacked or burned to death in factional 
fighting around Johannesburg. The latest killings brought the death toll to 
more than 500 in the last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Township streets were barricaded with burning tires, and small bands of Zulu 
and Xhosa fighters with homemade weapons clashed throughout the day. Police and 
army reinforcements sought to keep the rival factions apart but had limited 
success. 
</P>
<P>
In Vosloorus, east of Johannesburg, police found 39 bodies Wednesday morning. 
More than 40 people were killed in the townships of Kagiso, Tokhoza, Daveytown, 
Katlehong and Tembisa. Most of the dead were young men, although a 13-month-old 
baby was killed Tuesday night when gasoline bombs were tossed into two houses 
in Kwathema. 
</P>
<P>
A group of mothers, fearing additional bloodshed, marched on the Vosloorus 
police station Wednesday to demand more police patrols in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The violence that has flared, off and on, since Aug. 13 in the townships that 
surround Johannesburg is the bloodiest in South Africa's history. The death 
count, 502, already is nearly three times the number who died in the two months 
after the Soweto uprising of June 16, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said that revenge appeared to be the prime force behind 
the conflict, which pits Zulu migrant workers supporting Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha movement and residents, many of them Xhosas, who are 
loyal to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"If you allow the law of 'an eye for an eye,' very soon the only people around 
are going to be blind," said Tutu, who cut short a trip to Canada because of 
the violence and returned to South Africa on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for tolerance, tolerance, tolerance and yet more tolerance," 
Tutu said from his home in Soweto. "People must not seek to take revenge. We 
are making an appeal to our people: Please, yes, defend yourselves, but don't 
pay back." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu suggested that an international peacekeeping force be organized to end the 
township wars. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has alleged that the white-led police force sides with the Zulus of 
Inkatha. President Frederik W. de Klerk denied that there is any bias among the 
police, about half of whom are black, and called for an end to "unfounded 
allegations of partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, after lengthy discussions with both Mandela and Buthelezi in recent 
days, on Wednesday issued a statement urging the two men to exert "strong 
leadership" and bring their two organizations together for high-level meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi has expressed eagerness to meet with Mandela, but Mandela is under 
strong pressure from within the ANC to avoid any such meeting. Many of 
Mandela's supporters attribute the current conflict to Buthelezi's attempts to 
expand Inkatha influence outside his home base of Natal province. Natal has 
been the scene of fighting between Zulus who support Buthelezi and those who 
support the ANC. Nearly 4,000 people have died in this fighting since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Tension is especially high among black leaders. On Tuesday, Buthelezi and Gen. 
Bantubonke Holomisa, leader of the Xhosa homeland of Transkei, met with 
government officials and agreed to call on all black leaders to stop blaming 
one another for the war and work for peace. 
</P>
<P>
The statement had scarcely come out, however, when Holomisa started saying that 
the police were siding with Buthelezi's fighters and Buthelezi was saying that 
Holomisa's troops were helping ANC supporters fighting the Inkatha in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
The current violence near Johannesburg has frightened many whites, driving some 
into the right-wing Conservative Party and triggering doubts in others about 
the future of democracy if the government keeps its promise to grant the black 
majority a vote in national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting has also undermined the efforts of moderate black leaders, such as 
Mandela. The ANC-affiliated South African Youth Congress said Wednesday that it 
was urging its members to form neighborhood defense committees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the violence threatens the ANC-government peace process. One sign 
of a deteriorating relationship between the ANC and the government is the daily 
ANC allegations of police complicity in Inkatha attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Another point of contention has been De Klerk's decision to drop the names of 
three key ANC leaders from the list of those granted temporary immunity from 
prosecution in order to participate in the peace talks. They are Chris Hani, 
chief of staff of the ANC's military wing, Ronnie Kasrils, former intelligence 
chief for the ANC military, and Mac Maharaj, who, with Kasrils, had been 
building the ANC underground. 
</P>
<P>
Maharaj has been in detention since last month. Kasrils is in hiding, and Hani 
is in the Transkei homeland. The police say that a charge of high treason is 
being investigated in the case of Hani, who angered the government by telling 
ANC guerrillas that the suspension of the armed struggle did not mean the war 
was over. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Wednesday, the ANC lodged "a most vigorous protest" against the 
withdrawal of immunity for the three men. 
</P>
<P>
ANC sources said their organization might insist that Hani be allowed to take 
part in the talks designed to oversee the ANC cease-fire.

PERCEPTION OF POLITICAL TINGE MAKES NIH JOB HARD TO FILL

Being director of the National Institutes of Health -- the nation's premier 
biomedical research facility -- was at one time considered among the most 
prestigious scientific jobs in the world. Now, it seems that the Bush 
Administration can't even give the job away. 
</P>
<P>
The post has been vacant for more than a year, the longest stretch in the NIH's 
100-year history, after Dr. James Wyngaarden, a Ronald Reagan appointee, left 
in July, 1989, at the request of the White House. The Bush Administration 
reportedly wanted to select its own choice for the post, but now there are no 
prospects in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"The job has too many problems and not enough rewards," said Dr. Howard 
Streicher, an AIDS researcher in the National Cancer Institute, one of the 
NIH's 13 institutes. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, many believe that the job has become too politicized in 
recent years, with the director having to bend too often to the will of the 
White House. Early on, for example, some candidates were asked their views on 
abortion, a so-called litmus test that several aspirants found offensive. 
William H. Danforth, chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis and the 
brother of Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), took his name out of the running 
after he was so queried. 
</P>
<P>
Such questioning "creates an environment that is very upsetting to people 
here," said one NIH researcher who asked not to be identified. "It makes you 
concerned that whoever gets the job will be a political appointee rather than 
someone who is truly in the field." 
</P>
<P>
But one former NIH official, who left government for an academic job, 
maintained that "the job has a strong political component." 
</P>
<P>
The official, who once worked at the Department of Health and Human Services, 
said: "I could see during my time how important it was for an agency head to be 
well-connected to have his voice heard." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Administration now insists there is no litmus test -- and that 
candidates are no longer asked about abortion -- resentment over the early 
questions apparently has lingered. Further, in a related area, widespread 
opposition remains in the scientific community to the Administration's 
continued ban on federal funding for research using fetal tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor making the job unattractive, some say, is that it has become too 
administrative, leaving little opportunity to keep a hand in bench science. 
This was one of the reasons that federal AIDS research chief Dr. Anthony S. 
Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, removed his name from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reasons, there is no question that the lack of a permanent strong 
leader at the NIH has had a serious demoralizing effect on the agency and on 
the non-governmental researchers who receive NIH grants. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, nine Democratic members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee, which has jurisdiction over the NIH, wrote to Bush urging him to 
fill the position. 
</P>
<P>
"The National Institutes of Health are too important to the health of the 
nation to permit the position of director to be trivialized by the political 
manipulations that have characterized the selection process up to this point," 
the letter said. "We urge you to end the current disarray and petty 
machinations . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The person who eventually takes the job will confront numerous problems, among 
them a continuing budget shortage and the agency's continuing inability to 
recruit senior investigators, largely because its salaries are not competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"They want a fantastic, superb, respected scientific leader who will set 
direction and goals for biomedical research," Streicher said. "They also want a 
super administrator able to handle every problem without offending anybody. 
It's impossible."

<P>
When he purchased his own fishing boat in 1988, Vito Ferrara dreamed of making 
his living from the sea, the way his family had for generations. 
</P>
<P>
But, two years later, those dreams have all but run aground as Ferrara 
struggles to pay his bills on a meager income. "I'm just starting. For me, it's 
pretty bad," Ferrara, 27, said. 
</P>
<P>
His frustration is common among New England fishermen these days, as many face 
financial hardships severe even for an occupation that is known for its 
travails. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst condition I've seen in the fishery in all my life," said 
Anthony J. Verga, the 55-year-old chief of a Gloucester commission that aids 
fishermen. He said that many fishermen have recently sold their boats and 
others have been repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Favazza, who owns a Gloucester tavern frequented by fishermen, said: 
"It seems like every week someone comes in saying he's giving it up." 
</P>
<P>
Although diverse factors are contributing to the slump in the Northeast fishing 
industry -- including a regional economic recession -- the key one may be a 
problem that is worrying biologists: the depletion of fish stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The decline is especially marked in groundfish, which include the Atlantic cod, 
haddock and flounders that have been the traditional mainstays of the New 
England seafood economy. 
</P>
<P>
Federal figures show that the aggregate New England catch of 10 of the most 
common groundfish species dropped from 359 million pounds in 1982 to 161 
million pounds in 1989. Haddock catches plunged 84% from 1978 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Many blame the decline on overfishing that occurred in the wake of the 1977 
Magnuson Act, in which the United States claimed a 200-mile fishing zone. 
</P>
<P>
The law, enacted to protect American fishermen from the foreign vessels that 
were depleting domestic fish stocks, sparked a fishing boom in New England. The 
region's fleet was inundated by new boats with highly sophisticated gear. 
</P>
<P>
The increased fishing reduced the region's fish stocks to levels even below 
what they had been when the foreign boats departed. Many criticize the New 
England Fishery Management Council, created to regulate fishing in the new 
federal zone off New England, for failing to curtail the fishing boom when it 
had the chance. 
</P>
<P>
The council is composed of representatives of the six New England states, and 
its rules generally must also be applied in state waters up to three miles off 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
The council has adopted regulations in recent years that aim to conserve fish 
stocks by, among other things, limiting the size at which fish may be caught. 
</P>
<P>
But Frederick M. Serchuk, a biologist with the National Marine Fishery 
Service's laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., said such regulations fall short. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts officials hope to spur the council to take tougher steps with the 
release soon of a report by a state groundfish task force. 
</P>
<P>
State Fisheries and Wildlife Commissioner Walter E. Bickford said the panel 
probably will call for a reduction in fishing of up to two-thirds over the next 
decade. The task force is considering a variety of ways to do that, including 
restricting the numbers of people who can fish, in hopes that such measures 
will forestall widespread financial turmoil in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Gibson, chairman of the council's groundfish committee, said the council 
does not dispute the need for a major reduction in fishing but is searching for 
a way to accomplish it. "You can't reduce the industry (by) half and not expect 
people to be very upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maine Natural Resources Commissioner William Brennan warned that major forced 
reductions in fishing could be "absolutely devastating" to the industry. But 
Bickford, whose task force may propose government "buyouts" for retiring 
fishermen, said the alternative to action now is the loss of the fisheries in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We've managed that resource like the Brazilians are managing their rain 
forests," he said of the fisheries. "We're basically running it into the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
While they debate how to save the groundfish, officials say not all is bleak 
for New England's seafood industry, pointing to growing interest by foreign 
markets in such non-traditional species as dogfish and skate and the abundance 
of some traditional species, including lobster. 
</P>
<P>
But that is small comfort to Ferrara, who said even selling his boat to get out 
of the business was no longer easy. "Nobody wants to buy a fishing boat. They 
see no future in it," he said.

FEMALE MARINES LEFT BEHIND IN DEPLOYMENT

Some female Marines were left behind when their units were sent to Saudi Arabia 
in the first days of the U.S. military deployment, the U.S. Marine Corps 
acknowledged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The corps said some women troops remained in the United States in the initial 
stages of the deployment to ensure they would not encounter active combat upon 
arrival in the Persian Gulf. Federal law prohibits women in the armed services 
from serving in combat units. 
</P>
<P>
But the corps said that as soon as positions are established and it becomes 
clear that the women will not encounter combat they will be permitted to leave 
for the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The concern, military officials said, was that the first troops deployed in the 
region were entering unknown territory and could have been forced by unforeseen 
circumstances to adopt an offensive stance. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go into an unknown situation, even though your orders may state that 
you are there in a defensive capacity, if anyone is going to have to switch 
from a defensive to an offensive posture, it is the initial units," Marine 
spokesman Randy Gaddo said. "You would not want to put women in a position that 
would be breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
For security reasons, the corps would not divulge how many women were affected 
by the delay or what rank and positions they hold. But it said that women from 
all U.S. services have been on active duty in Saudi Arabia since last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that there are women there," Pentagon spokesman Stuart 
Wagner said. "There are women from all of the services there." 
</P>
<P>
Not all women had to remain behind, Wagner added. He reported that two female 
Marines left with their units without any delay in the first days of the 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the women who were separated from their units were upset about the 
decision. "All of the women Marines are being pulled out and replaced by men," 
a woman officer complained in the Aug. 27 issue of Navy Times. "This is a 
perfect example of how the Marine Corps is paying lip service to us."

MEDIA: THE PRO-IRAQI NATION IS SHOWING GROWING RESENTMENT AND SUSPICION OF THE 
HORDES OF REPORTERS WHO HAVE COME TO COVER THE GULF CRISIS.

AQABA, Jordan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reporters were too busy scribbling in their small note pads to notice that 
the pilot of the little glass-bottom boat was steering them to an unscheduled 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
The pair had hired the boat, not to gaze at the elaborate coral formations in 
the bay, but rather to look at two blockade-busting Iraqi ships at anchor in 
Aqaba's port. Their note-taking apparently made the pilot nervous -- and he 
suddenly decided to turn them in as spies to soldiers patrolling a nearby 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
The incident underlined the growing resentment and suspicion of the hordes of 
reporters who have landed in Jordan to cover the Middle East crisis from this 
vantage point next door to Iraq. Most of the reporters are Western, and the 
Jordanian public has taken a solidly pro-Iraqi stand. As the crisis continues, 
passions are surfacing more and more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely on the beaten track of reporters in normal times, Jordan is suddenly a 
preferred listening post. Refugees from Kuwait and Iraq have been passing 
through the country by the thousands on their way home. On the way, they have 
dropped tales of fear and deprivation in Kuwait; an occasional Westerner who 
escapes finds himself an instant celebrity, so large is the appetite for news 
of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's position between Iraq and Israel also makes the desert nation an 
especially sensitive barometer of surrounding tensions. The decision of King 
Hussein, the country's leader, to stay on good terms with Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein makes the country something of a diplomatic crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, just the other day, Iraq's foreign minister chose Jordan's capital, 
Amman, as the place to offer his government's latest call for talks. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of so many reporters -- some estimates put the number at 400 -- 
makes Jordanians nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"We see them as a sign of bad times, like vultures," said Dureid Mahamseh, a 
local government official in Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
The sympathies of most Jordanians for Saddam Hussein -- who is seen as someone 
who can stand up to Israel and, with his forcibly augmented oil wealth, as 
someone who can help Jordan out of its economic problems -- has begun to create 
strains with the journalistic flock. 
</P>
<P>
In Aqaba, the glass-bottom boat's operator, who had been told by his passengers 
that they were going to inspect Iraqi ships in the harbor, nonetheless felt 
that at some point they were doing something sinister. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry," he said as he pulled to shore next to the army post. "You are 
reporters. I am Jordanian." 
</P>
<P>
On the beach, the reporters introduced themselves to an officer in charge, and 
the officer, interrupted from his lunch, quickly sent them on their way with 
only the warning not to approach within 300 yards of the dock. In Arabic, he 
told the boatman not to bring him any more suspects unless they were taking 
pictures, an activity always forbidden at the port. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the boatman explained that a colleague of his had been arrested for 
taking an Italian television crew around the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the pro-Iraqi passions interfere with the normally polite 
demeanor of Jordanians. In Aqaba recently, a couple of reporters needed to 
catch a taxi back to Amman, four hours away. The driver they tried to hire, 
when he found out the reporters were American, launched into a long speech 
about how the Arabs were victim of Western conspiracies. It was mutually 
decided that the trip would be too long for both sides to carry on such a 
conversation and the passengers switched to a less-involved cabbie. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell Bush to stay home," the driver called out in his send-off. "Death to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
These outbursts are the exception, however. During the frequent, well-organized 
anti-American demonstrations that have taken place in several cities, 
protesters interrupt their rhythmic chants in order to explain their views 
quietly and on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when an American flag was being burned at an Amman mosque, a demonstrator 
sympathetically whispered to a reporter to say that the display was nothing 
personal -- but the reporter explained that the same thing sometimes happens in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you mean you burn foreign flags?" the protester asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," the reporter replied, "we more often burn our own flag." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrator replied with a confused murmur before returning to his 
chanting.

RESERVISTS GAIN DUTIES, BENEFITS OF THE REGULARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Reservists called up for active duty immediately become full-time military 
personnel with all the obligations and benefits of regular full-time service. 
In most cases, they must abandon their civilian jobs and relocate to military 
posts, disrupting families and careers. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some frequently asked questions concerning the legal and professional 
ramifications of the reserve call-up authorized Wednesday by President Bush: 
</P>
<P>
Question: What functions will reservists perform in the current crisis? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The initial deployment is expected to involve support personnel for 
specialized functions such as cargo handling, airlift, food and water handling, 
surface transportation, medical services, construction and intelligence. 
Personnel will be called from Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard reserves. 
Some reserves will be transported to Saudi Arabia and other locations in the 
Middle East, but many will be assigned to positions at seaports and military 
bases within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How long will reservists be assigned to active duty? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the absence of a declaration of war, President Bush is authorized to call 
up as many as 200,000 reservists for up to 90 days, and he has the authority to 
extend the call-up for an additional 90 days. Individual reservists may be 
asked to serve for any part of that time, depending on the needs of the 
military. After the first 180 days, the President needs congressional 
authorization to continue the mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will reservists lose their regular jobs? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Under federal law, employers are required to reinstate reservists in 
their former jobs or in jobs of equivalent status and salary. Employers also 
are required to grant all promotions or salary increases that normally would 
have been granted during the period when a reservist is on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will reservists and their families forfeit job-related benefits, such as 
health insurance and pension plans? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Reservists who are called up for more than 31 days and their families 
receive immediate coverage under the military medical system. This includes 
care at all military medical facilities and health insurance under the Civilian 
Health and Medical Program of the Armed Services. The situation is more complex 
for other benefits, depending on each employer's company policy. Federal law 
requires that reservists receive the same benefits accorded to other employees 
who take leaves of absence. This generally requires employers to continue 
making payments to employee pension plans, although there may be exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How much are reservists paid? 
</P>
<P>
A: Reservists receive the same salaries as full-time military personnel. 
Salaries are based on several factors, including rank, length of service, 
number of dependents and special service bonuses, such as overseas pay or 
combat pay. The base salary for a private with less than two years of service 
is $812 per month, or $9,744 per year. A major with 12 years of service 
receives a base salary of $3,073 per month, or $36,876 per year. Reservists are 
not compensated by the government for any shortfall between their military and 
civilian salaries, and private employers typically do not make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What if a reservist's family finds it difficult to live on the military 
salary? 
</P>
<P>
A: Families of reservists may be eligible for several forms of financial 
assistance, including food stamps and other federal programs as well as 
assistance provided through the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are reservists on active duty permitted to take home leaves? 
</P>
<P>
A: Reservists receive the same leave benefits as regular military personnel, 
usually 30 days of vacation per year. All requests for leaves or vacations must 
be approved by the service. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are any reservists excused from a call-up, such as self-employed businessmen 
or physicians? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Reservists are expected to "keep their affairs in order" so they can be 
mobilized at a moment's notice. Military officers screen reserve units 
periodically to ensure that members are able to serve if needed. Those who 
attain key positions within their communities are usually removed from the 
reserves.

SECURITY COUNCIL URGES EMERGENCY JORDAN AID 
</P>

<P>
The Security Council urged Wednesday night that Jordan be given emergency 
financial aid to cushion the impact of U.N. sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jordan and Bulgaria pleaded for relief from the embargo in what was 
expected to be only the first of many requests from countries claiming to be 
hard hit by the embargo imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council, meeting informally in a closed session, focused 
on Jordan as a particularly compelling case that might serve as a standard 
against which other claims could be considered, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, saying it faces losses of $1.5 billion a year, asked for $500 million 
in grants, loans and subsidized oil, but the Security Council did not recommend 
a specific figure for consideration by its sanctions committee. 
</P>
<P>
The international organization is expected to draw up a plan for aid donated by 
the wealthier member nations. Thomas R. Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations, said that the United States has committed an "extremely large" 
package, amid concern that Jordan is helping Iraq pierce the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to discuss details with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Crispin Tickell, British ambassador to the United Nations, said after the 
council session that while there was concern that many other countries would 
file claims, "all agreed that Jordan was a special case and needed particular 
help." 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan is right up against the frontier (with Iraq) and is a virtually 
landlocked country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The development came as the United States faced continued Soviet resistance to 
a proposed U.N. resolution allowing military force to back up sanctions against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering said he is optimistic that the five permanent members of the Security 
Council -- the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- can 
work out problems and present a resolution to the full council as early as 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"Language was worked on, progress was made. The United States still hopes for a 
Security Council meeting as early as tomorrow," Pickering said Wednesday after 
talks involving the five permanent members. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and France support the U.S. effort to gain broader international 
support for its aggressive policing of the embargo. The U.S.-sponsored 
resolution would allow foreign naval vessels to use minimum force in halting 
ships and inspecting cargo to determine if attempts are being made to break the 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet Union has demanded that military action be controlled by a U.N. 
committee -- not unilaterally by a member nation, an arrangement insisted on by 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Soviets and the Chinese also have objected to a broad, unprecedented 
grant of military authority until there is clear evidence that the embargo has 
been breached. But China has indicated that it would abstain rather than oppose 
the resolution, while the Soviet Union has held out the threat of a veto. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, wary of joining military action, urged diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
"The main obstacle is that force should be used very carefully and at due 
time," Valentin V. Lozinsky told reporters on emerging from negotiations at the 
French mission. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. resolution "is premature," he added, "because other means have not 
been exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
Any one of the permanent members of the Security Council can block a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III conferred with Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze on the Soviets' insistence that the council's 
long-inactive Military Staff Committee be put in charge of directing embargo 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush reiterated at a news conference in Kennebunkport, Me., that the 
United States believes it has authority to enforce the embargo on its own, 
based on Article 51 of the U.N. Charter empowering a member to respond to an 
attacked nation's request for help -- in this case, Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States, wanting to be portrayed as part of an international 
force instead of as just a lone adversary of Iraq, has vigorously sought the 
United Nations' blessing for military action ever since U.S. warships fired 
warning shots across the bows of two oil tankers headed from Iraq to Yemen last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Momentum for the resolution slackened early Tuesday after Yemen promised to 
abide by the embargo and not unload the tankers' oil. 
</P>
<P>
In four resolutions, the Security Council has denounced Iraq's invasion, 
declared an international economic boycott on Iraq, rejected Iraq's proclaimed 
annexation of Kuwait, and demanded that all foreigners trapped in Kuwait and 
Iraq be allowed to go home. 
</P>
<P>
However, it has not approved a blockade against Iraqi shipping, or sanctioned 
the U.S.-led multinational force deployed in the region to enforce the trade 
embargo. Under Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, the Security Council may call 
for a blockade and enforcement of its embargo through military force if 
sanctions have been violated. This article has never been invoked. 
</P>
<P>
In pleading for U.N. help, Bulgarian President Zheliu Zhelev wrote Wednesday 
that, while his country strongly supports sanctions against Iraq, it is 
suffering "grave economic losses." 
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq's $1.2-billion debt to Bulgaria was being paid back by oil 
shipments that are now cut off. Also, the country stands to lose more than $160 
million this year from "the non-delivery of goods and the cutoff of 
international transport activities to Iraq and Kuwait."

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT COMPUTERS UNPROTECTED, GAO SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY: OUTSIDERS CAN PENETRATE 'STATE-OF-ART' FACILITY, REPORT CLAIMS. 
SECRET IDENTITIES MIGHT BE LEARNED BY CRIMINALS.

<P>
A lack of adequate computer security within the Justice Department is 
endangering highly sensitive information, including identities of undercover 
operators and confidential informants, congressional investigators have 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the department moved its main data center last year to a new 
"state-of-the-art" facility, unauthorized remote users of computers can still 
enter and exit the system electronically without being detected, the General 
Accounting Office said in a report to be issued soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat of intrusion into these systems is serious, and there are criminals 
who could benefit immensely from such covert encroachments," Rep. Bob Wise 
(D-W.Va.) said in a letter urging Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to "immediately 
correct" the security flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Wise, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on government 
information, justice and agriculture, asked for the study in July after an 
earlier GAO examination of the Justice Department's office automation systems 
turned up security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The report directed its harshest criticism at the department's new data center 
in Rockville, Md. It said the center can be accessed through phone lines and 
commercial computer networks, making it vulnerable to remote users who could 
"introduce viruses and other disruptive software . . . into vulnerable computer 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
A department official who requested anonymity said he was "dismayed" that the 
GAO assessment failed to cite "a lot of corrective action already taken and 
more that is under way." 
</P>
<P>
The official, who is involved in the work, said the data center was moved from 
downtown Washington to the Maryland location before security equipment had been 
installed because of fire and safety concerns at the older facility. A dispute 
between bidders has held up purchase and installation of security equipment, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the GAO examination described a broader set of problems, citing "many 
disturbing weaknesses in existing security which, if not corrected, could 
severely compromise both the computer systems and the sensitive information 
they process." 
</P>
<P>
In a directness unusual for a GAO document, a copy of which was provided to The 
Times, the report blamed the security weaknesses on "a lack of effective 
leadership and oversight by the justice management division," which is headed 
by Assistant Atty. Gen. Harry H. Flickinger. 
</P>
<P>
"If that reference is meant as a personal attack, there's no reason for it," 
said Daniel G. Eramian, the department's deputy director of public affairs. "If 
what they mean is that we lack review or audit (of computer security), we have 
requested additional resources from Congress for that and have not received 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The report covered computer security programs in the department's litigating 
units, which include 94 U.S. attorneys' offices around the nation and six 
divisions in Washington: antitrust, civil, civil rights, criminal, land and 
environmental protection, and tax. 
</P>
<P>
Those units "rely on computer systems to process a variety of highly sensitive 
information," including "the names of defendants, witnesses, informants and 
undercover law enforcement officials cited in grand jury proceedings, witness 
identification programs and criminal investigations," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators found that contingency plans to be implemented when computer 
services are disrupted had either not been prepared or not tested and that no 
mandatory computer security training was being given all employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Given recent hostile attacks on justice organizations, such as the March, 
1990, firebombing of a Drug Enforcement Administration office in Ft. Myers, 
Fla., Justice needs to establish effective procedures for continuing 
operations," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
GAO investigators said the new Rockville, Md., center lacks "surveillance 
devices, such as cameras or motion sensors, to monitor activities in critical 
areas." Guards were not stationed to observe activities, and video monitors, 
where used, lacked the capability to store and record information, should it be 
needed for a security investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Systems programmers with extensive knowledge of hardware and operating 
procedures had unescorted access to the data center and were capable of issuing 
critical computer commands that should have been limited to computer 
operators," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The security weaknesses at the main data center "reflect long-standing 
concerns" about similar shortcomings identified by the department's own audit 
of its former data center four years ago, according to the GAO.

E. GERMAN LAWMAKERS SET OCT. 3 FOR UNITY;

APPEARS TO REMOVE THE MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK TO RE-JOINING THE NATION.

<P>
After weeks of bitter infighting, the East German Parliament early today set 
Oct. 3 as the date for German political unity. 
</P>
<P>
The vote fixing the exact timing of unification appeared to remove the most 
problematic of the stumbling blocks remaining in a process that will re-join a 
Germany divided for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a truly historical event," Parliament President Sabine Bergmann-Pohl 
said after the conclusion of the session. 
</P>
<P>
Although observers warned that the unpredictable nature of the fledgling East 
German democracy still left open the chance for a reversal, the 294-62 vote was 
both decisive and backed by all major East German parties. 
</P>
<P>
It followed a heated, often emotional marathon debate in the Parliament in East 
Berlin. The issue, initially thought to be routine, had mushroomed into one of 
the most bitter in the unity process and a major embarrassment for all 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The date of Oct. 3 was a compromise that received the backing of both major 
East German parties -- the Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Lothar de 
Maiziere and the opposition Social Democrats, who left De Maiziere's coalition 
last week. The small Liberal and German Socialist parties also backed the 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats had wanted unity to occur on Sept. 15, and De Maiziere had 
preferred Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Because unification takes place through an East German "accession" to West 
Germany, the East German parliamentary vote decided the timing. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 3 accession date was made conditional on three actions: fixing the 
legal conditions of unity; agreeing on its external aspects with the four 
victorious World War II Allies, and completing preparations for creating five 
new state governments in the territory that presently forms East Germany. None 
of these are believed to present significant problems. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the accord, the East German government will cease to exist on 
Oct. 3, and the 400-member East German Volkskammer will select 144 of its 
members to join the West German Bundestag until all-German elections are held 
on Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Dieter Vogel, West Germany's deputy government spokesman, indicated that the 
first session of the joint Parliament will most likely be held in the Berlin 
Reichstag but that subsequent sessions before the elections will be in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, which was completed shortly before 2 a.m. this morning, came amid 
mounting public anger in both Germanys to end an unseemly, confusing debate on 
the date of unity. 
</P>
<P>
One suggestion for immediate unification and another for unity on Sept. 15 were 
rejected as the debate went into the early hours this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister De Maiziere acknowledged the public backlash during the start of 
the debate. He noted that his office had been deluged with telegrams and 
letters from citizens enraged that their elected representatives had devoted 
such time and political energy to the issue of the exact date for unification 
when virtually every aspect of East German national life needs urgent attention 
and the country's economy has been gradually disintegrating. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the date goes back to mid-June, when a motion put forth by 
East Germany's small German Socialist Union party proposing immediate 
unification was sidetracked into a committee after a brief debate in which 
passage at one point seemed possible. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a series of dates has been proposed, discussed, then rejected in a 
manner that has at times descended into political farce. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to finally agree on this," De Maiziere said. "Many people have gotten 
the idea that discussions over dates are more important to us than the solution 
of crucial problems." 
</P>
<P>
As a West German television commentator put it Wednesday evening, "Whenever 
unity occurs, it will no longer take place in dignity." 
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary debate occurred on a day that a West German television straw 
poll found that 80% of the East German participants wanted unity immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the major parties in both Germanys have now concluded that swift 
unity is necessary to end the uncertainty that has prevented any of the 
large-scale West German investment needed to help revive East Germany's 
inefficient, antiquated industry. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of investment and the harsh winds of Western-style competition have 
crippled East Germany's former centrally planned, state-run farm and industrial 
sectors, sending an average of 25,000 new workers each week into unemployment 
lines.

'THE SIMPSONS' FACES A TOUGH DRAW AGAINST 'COSBY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"The Simpsons," Fox TV's runaway hit, moves to its new Thursday time slot 
tonight, challenging NBC's top-rated "The Cosby Show." Both programs are 
repeats, and "The Simpsons" will remain in reruns until late October -- a month 
after new episodes of "Cosby" start airing. Not an auspicious beginning for 
what many observers see as a David vs. Goliath confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Fox Entertainment President Peter Chernin insists that he is not out to topple 
"Cosby," but to gain a toehold in weeknight prime time. At the recent meeting 
of the television critics, he announced: 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one in this company who looks at this as 'Let's take on "The Cosby 
Show." ' We think that if we're really lucky and very fortunate we'll come in 
second place to them because the other two guys (CBS and ABC) aren't as strong. 
We're hoping to establish a little bit of a foothold there." 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it as a very serious challenge, and I think that we probably will 
take a dent on Thursday night, certainly with the younger portion of the 
audience," NBC Entertainment Chairman Brandon Tartikoff said in a recent 
speech. "My secret hope is that while we may lose something on the younger 
side, that we also may get three, four share points back from the 35-plus side 
of the equation. I wouldn't mind ending up with the same share and rating as we 
ended the season with." 
</P>
<P>
The reason there won't be any new episodes of "The Simpsons" until October lies 
in the program's appropriately unconventional origins. 
</P>
<P>
"Fox originally wanted a single special, but Jim Brooks and I said, 'No, give 
us a series or forget it,' " said "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening. "I knew it 
would take a little while -- not a long time, but a little while -- for an 
audience to catch on to the program. So Fox ordered 13 episodes without a 
pilot, and we ran out. We were working on the next 22 before the first 13 were 
done, but it takes about six months to come up with and animate an episode 
because of the cumbersome nature of animation." 
</P>
<P>
Work on the next 22 installments of the irreverent cartoon is proceeding at a 
breakneck pace at the Clasky/Csupo studio in Hollywood, where five crews 
prepare five episodes simultaneously. The three-story gray building seems to 
overflow with artists and drawings, and additional space is being prepared in a 
second building down the block. Nine years ago, the Clasky/Csupo studio 
consisted of the apartment of the married founders, Arlene Clasky and Gabor 
Csupo. 
</P>
<P>
Csupo, who serves as animation co-creative director on "The Simpsons," was born 
in Budapest, Hungary, in 1952, and learned animation at the Pannonia studio 
there. In 1975, he and four friends obtained passports to Yugoslavia, then 
walked 2 1/2 hours through a dark train tunnel under the mountains to Austria 
and freedom, a journey he laughingly described as "quite an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Csupo eventually made his way to Stockholm, where he scrounged free-lance 
animation jobs, but little work was being done in Sweden. He met designer 
Clasky while she was on a visit to Stockholm: She persuaded him to come to Los 
Angeles where he could find jobs more easily. Csupo emigrated in 1979, and the 
couple married later that year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, they opened their own studio and began producing animated commercials 
and logos. The versatility of their output attracted the people at Gracie Films 
when they were looking for someone to animate the work of Groening and M.K. 
Brown for "The Tracey Ullman Show." 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing about Clasky/Csupo is that it's not an animated sausage 
factory, cranking out several shows," said Groening. "Their artists are young 
and eager to try to new things -- they haven't learned bad habits or been 
beaten down by the system. They bring an enormous enthusiasm to the work. I 
also think the studio offered to do the show for very little money. 
</P>
<P>
"My characters are hard to draw. My drawing style is very flat, and I basically 
draw things in three-quarter profile. It was interesting for me to see how the 
characters look from behind, which I'd never been able to draw. We had to make 
certain decisions: Is the top of Bart's head flat -- or is it pointed like a 
meat tenderizer? We change our minds about the answers from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
The speed with which the original 60- to 90-second adventures of "The Simpsons" 
had to be made for "The Tracey Ullman Show" made it easy for the artists to 
change their minds. David Silverman and Wes Archer, who animated the segments, 
didn't have time to make sure the characters were identical in every scene: 
</P>
<P>
"Wes and I would look over each other's shoulder and say things like, 'Oh, 
you're drawing Bart with nine points of hair? I've been drawing him with 10,' " 
said Silverman, who is now a director on the series. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt's characters don't follow the normal construction of the Disney or 
Warners characters, which are based on circles and ovals," he said. "Wes and I 
try to get the animators to think of them as puppets with cylindrical bodies, 
tubular limbs and wedge-shaped feet. It's harder to draw a character designed 
in a two-dimensional style than one that's intended for animation from the 
onset." 
</P>
<P>
Increasing production from 90 seconds to 30 minutes per week meant that the 
shows would have to be made like Saturday morning cartoons, with animation and 
ink-and-paint work done overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of meetings about how to expand without overexpanding," said 
Csupo. "We also did lots of research: Margot Pipkin, who was the producer at 
the time, and I flew to Asia and visited every studio personally. A lot of 
these places operate out of a two-bedroom house and hand everything out to 
free-lancers, so there's no quality control. But we didn't want to go to one of 
the big factory-like studios, either. We were looking for something in the 
middle that was efficiently set up, but not too big to handle our project with 
care." 
</P>
<P>
The contract went to Acom in Korea. Although all the people involved in the 
show praise the work of the Korean artists, problems invariably arise when the 
directors and animators are 8,000 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a cultural gap that we're not always able to bridge," said Groening. 
"They sometimes animate the characters reading right to left, as they do in 
Korea, rather than left to right, the way we do here. Apparently, there's a 
fruit in Korea similar to a banana, which is not yellow: When we had them 
animate bananas, they came out this very strange brown. We fix these things, 
but it's cumbersome." 
</P>
<P>
Groening, Csupo and Silverman agree that the biggest challenge the animators 
face is finding a style of movement that's appropriate to the characters' 
designs and personalities. Silverman describes the animation of Bart and his 
family as "limited until they exert a lot of energy -- they just wait for those 
moments to explode." 
</P>
<P>
"We had one dance sequence of Marge and Homer that was just too good," said 
Groening. "It was a virtuoso piece of animation, but it was out of character 
for them to be such good dancers, so we had to clunkify it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "The Simpsons," Clasky/Csupo continues to produce commercials, 
titles ("Quantum Leap," "In Living Color"), rock videos (Luther Vandross' "Here 
and Now"), trailers ("Die Hard 2," "Nuns on the Run") and concert films 
("Terrifying" for the Rolling Stones). Their artists are working on the station 
breaks for NBC's new Saturday morning lineup and a special that will air on HBO 
in October, based on Judith Viorst's children's book, "Alexander and the 
Terrible, Horrible, No-Good, Very Bad Day." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the future of his studio, Csupo grows uncharacteristically 
serious: 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we're being very selective about what we take on," he said. "We 
turn down at least one show a week because the designs or the subject or the 
ideas don't interest us. We just want to take it very slowly and do 
high-quality programs, either for prime time or Saturday morning. But if it's 
for Saturday morning, I promise you whatever we do will be unlike anything 
that's on, because Saturday morning is pretty much a disaster area."

MUSIC CENTER TO OFFER JOFFREY 1-YEAR CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: THE EXTENSION, WHICH FOLLOWS RESIGNATIONS THAT ROCKED THE COMPANY 
EARLIER THIS YEAR, REFLECTS A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE BY FUNDING AND BOOKING 
GROUPS.

All's quiet on the Joffrey Ballet front. Perhaps more quiet than the local 
dance-going public might care to know. 
</P>
<P>
At last sighting -- May 27 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the closing date 
of a monthlong season -- the Music Center resident ballet company had just come 
through a calamitous near-dismantling, involving the resignation of artistic 
director Gerald Arpino as well as key members of the joint board of directors 
from both New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the bicoastal company danced its spring season's final date, 
all the essentials were back in place. 
</P>
<P>
Except one: Next year's contract at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet's contract with the Music Center expired June 30. It wasn't 
until July 19 that Music Center officials voted to extend it for one year. 
However, the agreement has not yet been signed, according to Sandra Kimberling, 
Music Center Operating Co. president. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as soon as everyone returns from vacation (after Labor Day), we will have 
the signatures," said Brad Brian, vice chairman of the executive committee of 
the Joffrey board in Los Angeles. "We fully expect to be the resident company 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
But the one-year extension, rather than the three-year term awarded the Joffrey 
in 1987, reflects a wait-and-see attitude by funding and booking organizations 
on both coasts. The short-term extension also represents a throwback to 1983-86 
when the Joffrey operated year-to-year at the Music Center without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"That it is just a one-year extension comes as no surprise," said Jim Black, 
vice president of administration and finance at the Music Center. "The company 
needs a chance to reassess its situation and get back on its feet." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the "still-evolving changes within the Joffrey organization and 
its fund-raising activities in New York" as elements that need to be considered 
before longer-range negotiations are put on the table. 
</P>
<P>
Brian declined to comment on the one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
"While all parties concur that the upcoming Music Center schedule -- a 
"Nutcracker" season Dec. 19-30 and a spring '91 engagement, May 6 to June 2 -- 
are firm, Black said that the Joffrey's representatives "would like more money 
(from the Music Center), but this is nothing new. Basically, everyone is 
satisfied with the agreement as it's been drafted." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its residency contract with the Music Center, which funds the 
company, the Joffrey also is required to deal with the Music Center Operating 
Co., which books all Pavilion performances. That separate agreement spans a 
three-year term, which, coincidentally expires on June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one wants to acknowledge that the Joffrey's financial health 
determines its residency here, dollars are very much to the point. Box-office 
revenues cannot offset all expenses. Performing arts organizations usually 
operate at a deficit; the question is how large are the deficits. Funding -- 
private as well as public -- make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the Joffrey's troubles in May, the company faced nearly $2 
million in debts. It has now been reduced to $1.3 million, which includes a 
$308,000 federal tax debt and interest on penalties, according to Brian. 
</P>
<P>
The monetary issue just won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
"Each season we see sales in the upper 40%," said Kimberling. She said that the 
percentage "stays largely around there. And of course a record like that is of 
concern. It doesn't indicate growth and it means we must re-examine our 
relationship with the company." 
</P>
<P>
So sensitive an issue is the relatively poor box-office showing that the 
Joffrey, as a Music Center resident company, voted in December to keep American 
Ballet Theatre from signing a contract for annual July engagements at the 
Pavilion, according to Kimberling. 
</P>
<P>
"And they had good reason," she said, even though ABT self-presents and needs 
no guarantees from the house. "The public would be confused being invited to 
fund-raising galas at the Pavilion for two different ballet companies. Which 
one would seem to be the resident? As long as ABT stayed at Shrine Auditorium 
-- and kept a separate identity -- there was no threat." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Joffrey's veto power over other dance companies' appearances 
at the Music Center, ABT canceled its July engagement, substituting London as a 
tour city and bypassing Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But having the Pavilion to itself has not led to the Joffrey's audience 
development. It is commonly acknowledged that a company without a backbone of 
big spectacles like "Swan Lake" or "Giselle" has trouble wooing the mass 
public. And while the Joffrey has added the full-length "Romeo and Juliet" and 
"La Fille de Mal Gardee," dance writers say its identity, as a whole, veers 
away from that of the 19th-Century tutu extravaganzas so popular at the box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment no repertory beyond "The Nutcracker" has been announced for the 
Joffrey's U.S. appearances starting this fall. For 11 days in September the 
company performs in Athens and Paris. After that, it begins a series of 
"Nutcracker" engagements: in November at New York City Center, in December in 
Iowa City, Iowa, and at the Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the final work founder Robert Joffrey created before his death in 
1988 turned out to be its most valuable box-office asset. Beyond "The 
Nutcracker," only the dates are listed for a Lincoln Center run at the New York 
State Theater (Feb. 25 to March 17) and elsewhere: Taiwan in January, Hong Kong 
and Singapore in February, Los Angeles again in May and a national tour "to be 
announced."

CAL-SPAN KEEPS AN EYE ON SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a political opponent sabotaged his prized bill on ballot initiatives in 
the California Assembly, state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) learned 
about it from a rather unusual source: a television viewer. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Monday, my dear friend Mr. (Thomas) Hannigan (D-Davis) ungraciously moved 
a bill of mine that was on the Assembly floor to another committee than the one 
which had already approved it, a committee which no longer meets so it 
effectively killed the bill," Kopp said. "I was informed of it by my aide, who 
said he learned of it after he received a phone call from someone who saw it on 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
The viewer, Kopp supporter Les Kelting of San Bruno, saw the maneuvering on a 
new cable television channel. Run by a not-for-profit organization called the 
California Channel, the channel has been televising the state Assembly on a 
test basis for the past three weeks. Available in Orange County only on 
Dimension Cable's Channel 26 in South County, the test is scheduled to continue 
for the rest of this month. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to create a service for Californians much like C-SPAN, the 
not-for-profit channel funded by cable operators that televises congressional 
sessions, government briefings, press conferences and other elements of the 
legislative process in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
If CAL-SPAN survives past its tryout, the network will produce some educational 
programs, but personnel would not attempt to analyze events or conduct 
journalistic investigations. Instead, events would simply be presented, 
unedited, to the public. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according to plan, the California version, to be called CAL-SPAN, 
would start by televising the Assembly and later add the Senate, round-table 
discussions on political issues, viewer call-in programs and perhaps coverage 
of the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand the need for this," said 
Paul Koplin, the channel's executive director. "California is the largest state 
in the union in terms of population, but nobody knows anything about the state 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, not a single out-of-town television station maintains a Sacramento 
bureau. According to a feasibility study conducted for the channel, only 
Wyoming and Montana provide less electronic media coverage of their 
legislatures than California. During the busiest period of the legislative 
session, California television stations devoted just 1.7% of their news time to 
state legislative issues, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the test has won supporters from a Legislature that was initially 
concerned that the presence of the cameras would somehow affect lawmakers' 
behavior. The cameras are all the more visible in Sacramento because, unlike 
those installed in Congress for C-SPAN, they require bright lights because of 
the dark interior of the state's legislative chambers.

"Several of us thought it would really have a down side in terms of people 
playing to the camera and making speeches toward a different audience," said 
Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno). "But in one or two days, everybody forgot 
the cameras. People were very quiet and sat at their desks for about an hour. 
Then it was business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
In the three weeks since the trial began, footage has been used not only by 
constituents at home, but by lobbyists and legislators. Aides gather around 
sets to watch what their employers are doing. In one instance, a committee of 
lawmakers were arguing over who had taken what position on a bill during a 
previous debate. Then one remembered the cameras. They pulled out the tape and 
were able to resolve their argument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become almost indispensable already," said Michael Reese, director of 
communications for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-S.F.). "Right now I'm 
watching it, and they've got the floor debates going on. Bob Epple (D-Downey) 
is debating a bill on post-secondary education. And now they're taking a vote 
and I can watch the vote. It doesn't replace going down to the floor, but since 
I can't go down right now, I can still watch it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Assembly decides to make the channel a permanent fixture, it will mean 
making a significant budget commitment at a time when funds are tight. While 
the not-for-profit channel will absorb the cost of distributing the televised 
sessions to local cable channels and pay for program hosts and producers, the 
Assembly would have to pay for the actual cost of buying and running the 
cameras. (The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate also maintain their own 
broadcast facilities.) Koplin estimates that it would cost $1 million to wire 
the Assembly floor and one committee room for television and buy cameras, plus 
about $450,000 per year in operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to absorb it within our existing Rules Committee budget," said 
Bronzan. "But by comparison, this is a fraction of what it used to cost for us 
to send out our newsletters." 
</P>
<P>
With newsletters done away with as a result of a budget balancing ballot 
initiative, and the dearth of television reporting about Sacramento, CAL-SPAN 
may be the only way most Californians can gain information about state 
government, Bronzan said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Singer, news director of KCBS Channel 2 in Los Angeles, said he doesn't 
think that merely televising the Legislature is enough to inform people about 
state government. "Legislative sessions are usually not where the story is," 
Singer said. "They are sort of managed events. The story is what's going on 
outside the legislative chamber and what the implications of the story are."

'MISS DAISY' DRIVEN TO THE TOP

"Driving Miss Daisy," clearly the most popular rental since it came out three 
weeks ago, finally drove "War of the Roses" out of the top spot of the 
Billboard magazine rental chart. "Blaze," starring Paul Newman as a Southern 
politician romancing a stripper, is still a hot item in the rental market, 
moving up three more notches to No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Steel," starring Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie cop being stalked by a 
killer, is the kind of sexy, violent thriller that usually does big 
rental-market business. It debuted at No. 14 and could easily crack the Top 10. 
The bad reviews heaped on "Revenge" -- a steamy drama about a romantic triangle 
-- could be offset by the star-power of leading men Kevin Costner and Anthony 
Quinn. This one debuted at No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
* Cruisomaniacs alert! There's a new Tom Cruise movie on home video. If you had 
to name five actors who are the biggest favorites among renters, Cruise would 
be in there somewhere. His new one, "Born on the Fourth of July," is a grim 
drama about paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic that did very well ($69.1 
million) at the box-office. It debuted at No. 6 on the rental chart.

KOUT MAKES BOWL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic is enjoying a late-summer reprieve from its 
grueling al-fresco schedule this week. Nevertheless, business goes on as usual 
at Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
For three big concerts beginning tonight, the shell will be populated by the 
rapidly rising Seattle Symphony under Gerard Schwarz. For the little concert on 
Tuesday, the visiting honors fell to the ensemble that Schwarz had served as 
music director from 1978-86: the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The guest conductor on this occasion originally was to have been Christoph 
Perick, who had performed similar duties last year. A back injury, however, has 
forced the German maestro to cancel all his current engagements, including 
"Cosi fan Tutte" at the Music Center next April. 
</P>
<P>
In his place, the Chamber Orchestra engaged Jiri Kout, the Czechoslovakian 
maestro from Berlin, who happened to be in town preparing "Fidelio" for our 
opera company. 
</P>
<P>
Kout (pronounced "Coat") is a seasoned professional. He also happens to be a 
musician of discerning taste as well as a solid technician. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't seem to care about being a showy personality on the podium -- 
nothing wrong with that -- and he isn't equally persuasive in all challenges. 
Janacek's "Kat'a Kabanova," which he conducted here in 1988, suits him. 
Strauss' "Rosenkavalier," which he inherited from Carlos Kleiber at the Munich 
Festival, may not. 
</P>
<P>
In the vast open spaces of the Bowl, he suggested that he enjoys a definite 
affinity for Mozart. He savors gentle accents, subtle dynamics and delicate 
balances. He avoids exaggeration. Although he favors brisk allegros and piquant 
prestos, he invariably stresses the value of lyrical grace when introspective 
contrast is wanted. 
</P>
<P>
He did not -- perhaps, given rehearsal limitations, could not -- inspire the 
Chamber Orchestra to play with maximum confidence or precision at every turn. 
The string phrasing sometimes sounded tentative in moments of agitation. 
Statements that might have been elegantly polished occasionally emerged blurry. 
Still, the massed spirit remained willing. 
</P>
<P>
Kout and company opened the agreeably brief program with the cheer of Mozart's 
"Figaro" overture and continued with the sunny adventures of the Symphony No. 
30. The evening ended happily with the relatively grandiose flourishes of the 
Symphony No. 39. 
</P>
<P>
At showpiece time, just before intermission, Thomas Stevens appeared als Gast 
to toss off Joseph Haydn's intricate Trumpet Concerto in E-flat. The Los 
Angeles Philharmonic principal -- no night off for him -- played with 
virtuosity that seemed all the more dazzling for its nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' tone remained bright, steady and flexible, no matter how circuitous 
the coloratura flight. He could offer object lessons in stylish bravura to many 
a bel-canto diva and divo. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra provided the soloist with sensitive, ever-attentive support. 
After all his years in the opera-house pit, Kout knows exactly when to lead and 
when to follow. 
</P>
<P>
The audience, surprisingly large for so subdued an event, was officially 
tabulated at 11,291. 
</P>

STAGE WATCH: LONG BEACH TO GO BEYOND LIGHT OPERA; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: NEW DIRECTOR BARRY BROWN PLANS TO INCLUDE NON-MUSICAL PLAYS, TO TOUR 
AND TO SHOOT FOR CABLE TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Brown has big plans for Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The new producer/artistic director of the Long Beach Civic Light Opera wants 
his organization to "become more than just a civic light opera." 
</P>
<P>
He wants to do new, non-musical plays in the 840-seat Center Theatre of the 
Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center, adjacent to the 3,054-seat 
Terrace Theatre, where Long Beach Civic Light Opera has traditionally performed 
its shows. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to do at least one original musical each season, to expand the Terrace 
season from four to five musicals, to take LBCLO productions on tour, to shoot 
them for cable television. Availability of screen rights will be a factor, 
though not a prerequisite, when he selects shows. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach complex, he said, should "become the Kennedy Center of the West 
Coast -- but without the Kennedy Center's financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
The first item on his agenda after he begins work Sept. 10 is finding a 
replacement for "Meet Me in St. Louis," which has moved from Long Beach to the 
Los Angeles Civic Light Opera season, simultaneously with a move from Long 
Beach to Los Angeles CLO by Brown's predecessors, Martin Wiviott and Keith 
Stava. The rest of the Long Beach season, selected by Wiviott before Brown was 
appointed, will probably remain intact, said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Which will give him more time to develop his plans for the Center Theatre next 
door. This is the same theater that was going to be the home of a new company 
called Long Beach Repertory Theatre. Its first season of non-musical plays was 
scheduled to open earlier this year -- until its sponsor, the Regional Arts 
Foundation, pulled the plug, citing a lack of support from the community. 
</P>
<P>
Pegge Logefeil, executive director of LBCLO, said she disagrees with the 
foundation's conclusion regarding the potential for a theater group in that 
space. However, she also noted "it should be more economical for us" than it 
would have been for Long Beach Rep, which was starting from scratch. "We have a 
subscriber base (of nearly 28,000), the marketing tools and a staff in place." 
</P>
<P>
Shashin Desai, the artistic director of Long Beach Rep, gave his blessing to 
LBCLO's plans to use the space: "The more theater, the better. If I can't use 
that space, I'll do theater in some other space or share it. It proves I was 
right -- that Long Beach wants theater there." 
</P>
<P>
No definite plans have been made for the LBCLO expansion into the smaller 
theater. "We're working on it diligently," said Logefeil, "negotiating the 
figure as far as rent goes," but nothing will be settled until after Brown 
begins his job. 
</P>
<P>
Although Logefeil and Brown wouldn't rule out using the Center Theatre for 
small musicals as well as plays -- a plan that Wiviott was developing before he 
left -- they said the house is best suited for spoken drama. The idea that 
people might wonder why a civic light opera would program non-musicals doesn't 
appear to concern them. Logefeil pointed out that San Bernardino Civic Light 
Opera already presents non-musical plays as well as musicals. And Los Angeles 
Civic Light Opera presented two "straight" plays last season. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, best known for co-producing "La Cage aux Folles" and the Angela Lansbury 
and Tyne Daly revivals of "Gypsy," moved from New York to Hollywood at the 
beginning of the year to take a job as director of entertainment at Universal 
Studios. But he said the job required too much paperwork and not enough 
creativity. So, when film producer Ross Hunter, a member of the LBCLO board, 
sounded him out about the Long Beach position, he was very interested -- though 
he has seen only two LBCLO productions, "Follies" and "1776," both earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and his late partner Fritz Holt produced more than 10 Broadway shows. 
"The one part I never liked was raising money," he said -- one of the reasons 
he's looking forward to the Long Beach job, where other people are responsible 
for the fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
He and Holt spent 1976 running the Berkshire Theatre Festival in Stockbridge, 
Mass. There, he recalled, "we spent too much time wondering if there were 
enough M &amp; Ms and toilet paper." These, too, are responsibilities that 
won't be his at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ MUSICAL ADDED: "Black and Blue," a revue about the early years of jazz, 
will become the third entry in Los Angeles Civic Light Opera's 1990-1991 
season, arriving next summer. It joins the previously reported and now 
confirmed runs of "Meet Me in St. Louis" and "Grand Hotel," coming next spring. 
But no dates have been announced for any of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
LACLO subscribers also will be offered the opportunity to buy priority tickets 
for the return of "Les Miserables," slated to arrive at the Pantages in 
January, and the Georgian State Dance Company, scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
"Black and Blue" had been scheduled to open the 1988-89 LACLO season, but its 
producers canceled it six weeks ahead of opening, citing the expenses of 
building a set that could travel from Los Angeles to New York, where it opened 
that October. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean a scaled-back L.A. version next year? 
</P>
<P>
"We're bringing the full-out Broadway production to L.A.," said producer Mel 
Howard. "It'll take three weeks to put it up. Obviously it's not meant to tour. 
After L.A., we'll reduce the scenic side." Howard said he also intends to bring 
as many members of the New York cast as are willing to cross the country.

ANOTHER SNAG FOR 'SAIGON' PRODUCTION?; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THE POSSIBILITY OF CASTING CO-STAR LEA SALONGA COULD CREATE MORE 
PROBLEMS IN BRINGING THE SHOW TO BROADWAY.

What does "Miss Saigon" producer Cameron Mackintosh really want? 
</P>
<P>
While Actors' Equity postponed until today its response to Mackintosh's most 
recent request for more guarantees of artistic freedom before bringing the 
London hit to New York, speculation grew Wednesday that one of the key issues 
behind his statement was the casting of the title role. 
</P>
<P>
In reversing an earlier decision which had led Mackintosh to cancel the New 
York show, the union last Thursday approved the importing of Jonathan Pryce as 
the Eurasian Engineer. The producer responded Tuesday by insisting that Equity 
"act responsibly so that we do not become victims of an inflexible casting 
process." 
</P>
<P>
While Pryce's co-star Lea Salonga is Filipina, which might please some who had 
criticized Pryce's casting because he is white, she is not American and is not 
a certifiable star in the sense that Pryce is. Under some circumstances, that 
might lead Equity to nix her casting, should producer Cameron Mackintosh 
request permission to bring her to Broadway. 
</P>

Speaking from London, "Saigon" executive producer Nick Allott confirmed that 
Mackintosh wants the option of importing Salonga, "provided we couldn't find 
anyone in America." He said that previous casting efforts in the United States 
had netted "several possibilities" for the Salonga role, "but we haven't 
examined their talents closely enough. We hope to find several Kims in America 
. . . but we have yet to find her." 
</P>
<P>
Does Salonga want to come to New York? "Is the Pope Catholic?" replied Allott. 
"Any actress would love to star on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
If anyone protests the potential casting of Salonga, it probably would be the 
union, not the Asian-American activists who raised the issue of Pryce's 
casting, judging from comments made Wednesday at a Los Angeles press conference 
held by Asian-American activists. "We would appreciate the casting of an Asian 
actress," said actor Ping Wu. 
</P>
<P>
Even Vietnamese-American actor Le Tuan, who noted that it was "funny" for a 
Filipina to play the title role in "Miss Saigon," added that "it would be silly 
for us to demand that it be cast Vietnamese," noting that there are only "a 
half dozen" working Vietnamese actors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The participants in the press conference expressed skepticism about 
conciliatory comments in Mackintosh's statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Former "Star Trek" actor George Takei noted that "the theme of 'Miss Saigon' is 
to explore the responsibility of a wealthy, powerful country when it goes into 
a different culture" and added that Mackintosh "is going against the very theme 
of the play."

HAYES LEADS A STELLAR QUINTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
His cohorts playing with a smoldering heat that often burst spontaneously into 
flame, drummer Louis Hayes led a stellar New York-based quintet through an 
auspicious debut set Tuesday at Stingaree Gulch in the Sheraton San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup of Charles Tolliver (trumpet), John Stubblefield (tenor sax), George 
Cables (piano) and Clint Houston (bass) represents the upper echelon of the 
modern mainstream players who came to prominence in the '60s. That was a time 
when individuality and intensity marked the music, and those qualities were 
consistently evident in the group's performance that included Jerome Kern's 
"Yesterdays" and Tolliver's "Ruthie's Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, known for his work with Cannonball Adderley, Oscar Peterson and a band 
he co-led with Woody Shaw, is a masterful leader, pushing and prodding his 
players from the trap set, but never overwhelming them. In tandem with Houston, 
a monster bassist with a buoyant bravura of a sound, Hayes delivered the kind 
of energy that allows for spirited, inspiring improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver and Stubblefield made good use of this handsome musical platform. On 
"Heart," a catchy, dancing opus, the trumpeter emitted a tone with a bright, 
burnished core surrounded by a buzzing sonic outer surface and worked mostly in 
the middle register. His ideas were stated with a rat-a-tat rhythmic precision 
that swung hard, and he occasionally let loose with a wild, free-flung line. 
Stubblefield, who also has a distinctive, open sound that's part murmur, part 
shout, sometimes examined the chordal structure of a song like "Yesterdays" 
with a Coleman Hawkins-ish exactness; sometimes, employing a firmly controlled 
circular breathing technique, he allowed a seamless flood of notes come pouring 
off his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Cables comped zealously behind the horn players, and soloed with equal fervor, 
scoring with some rollicking chordal improvisations. Houston was another terror 
in his solo moments, exhibiting a fertile imagination and a commanding 
technique that could bring off whatever came to his mind, though he, like 
Cables, could use a bit of space in his sometimes note-heavy excursions. Hayes 
had a brief extemporaneous spot on "Blues for Macao"; otherwise he used his 
considerable abilities to further his partners' efforts.

STUDENTS PROBE THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Until this week, Kuwait was just a dot on the map for most Los Angeles 
students. But the escalating crisis sparked by Iraq's invasion of the tiny, 
oil-rich Arab nation now dominates class discussion at a number of schools as 
teachers incorporate the news into courses ranging from English to economics. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers are having a field day," said Allan Wexler, principal of Virgil 
Junior High, one of more than 100 schools in session this summer in Los 
Angeles. "They've got a tremendous opportunity. Lessons in geography, 
map-reading, history, economics . . . it's all coming together vividly in front 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
Like other major news events, the Persian Gulf crisis is being discussed in the 
"current events" portion of most social studies classes. But students are also 
writing about it in English classes, analyzing the impact on gasoline prices as 
an economics lesson and looking for parallels in the past in history courses. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about it every day," said Bell High School history teacher Beverly 
Cook. "The students are very concerned because it's close to home. They all 
have friends who are in the armed services. The young boys want to know what 
this means for them." 
</P>
<P>
Most high school students are too young to remember the days of mandatory 
military service, during the Vietnam War draft. "They don't understand 
Selective Service (registration requirements) and what it means to them," said 
Santa Monica teacher Randy Denis. "This is a steppingstone for us to explain 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Many students are concerned about the prospect of the country plunging into war 
"all over some stupid gas prices," as Bell senior Diana Reyes put it. 
</P>
<P>
With her classmates, Diana watched President Bush's press conference in her 
English class Wednesday, and has an essay on it due today. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue has more broad ramifications than I originally thought," said the 
17-year-old. "We talked about it at lunchtime and my friends made fun of it, 
but in class, they seemed worried." 
</P>
<P>
In Cook's class, an informal poll showed students strongly against further U.S. 
military action. Said one student, "I would rather pay $2 or $3 (a gallon) for 
gas rather than go and fight and eventually get killed." 
</P>
<P>
And while Santa Monica's Denis said that a "gung-ho, let's-get-them" attitude 
generally prevails among his students on military issues, other teachers say 
they see caution and skepticism as the U.S. military buildup in the Persian 
Gulf increases. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my students are questioning the motivation for our involvement," said 
Lew McCammon, a social studies teacher who coordinates an international 
relations academy at Belmont High School. 
</P>
<P>
"One young man said he felt this might be a convenient way for Bush to divert 
attention from (domestic) issues, like the savings and loan scandal. Some of 
them think very deeply about this." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many youngsters in Los Angeles, most of McCammon's students are 
foreign-born, coming from nations themselves wracked by war or internal strife. 
"These kids have been through a lot," he said. "They've lost parents, they've 
been on buses burned by terrorists. . . . They don't have the same feelings 
about this you'd get in a Midwestern American town." 
</P>
<P>
For them, said Belmont High teacher Phil Smith, the prospect of war "generates 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of scary," said Lourdes Siliezar, a native of El Salvador who 
recently graduated from Bell High School. "I just came from a war-stricken 
country two years ago to the United States looking for security, and now I'm 
faced with the possibility of another war . . . . I'm praying nothing will 
happen."

A DARING ESCAPE; 
</P>
<P>
REFUGEES: A LONG BEACH WOMAN POSED AS A BEDOUIN, BLUFFED HER WAY PAST IRAQI 
TROOPS IN THE KUWAIT DESERT AND CROSSED INTO SAUDI ARABIA.

<P>
Mary Rimdzius' friends in Kuwait had told her for months that Americans should 
be worrying about Iraq instead of Iran, but the Long Beach woman didn't believe 
them. 
</P>
<P>
She had also heard the rumors of 30,000 Iraqi troops in the desert, but they 
couldn't be true either, she reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
She even made jokes about the rumored troops, writing her family that those 
forces "must be nearly fried out there." And when she dropped a departing 
friend off at the airport the night of Aug. 1, her friend joked: "If they 
invade, grab my fur coat." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Iraqi forces were in the streets of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strange," Rimdzius, 45, said Wednesday, safely back home after a daring 
escape across the desert from Kuwait. "A man was cleaning the pool on one side 
of our building, and we were hearing shooting on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Rimdzius' husband died four years ago, and she went to Kuwait 18 months ago. 
Her brother, Paul Wilcott, a McDonnell Douglas executive, lived there, and 
Rimdzius said she joined him for a change of scenery. Wilcott was out of the 
country when the Iraqis invaded. 
</P>
<P>
She did not want to leave immediately after the invasion, she said, because she 
loves Kuwait and has many friends there. 
</P>
<P>
But she was soon "praying for the bombing to start. . . . We knew from Day 1 we 
were hostages and we'd be easy to control." 
</P>
<P>
When she heard Saddam Hussein's announcement that Americans were to be rounded 
up and detained in hotels, she decided it was time to initiate a bold plan. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, after she dyed her blonde hair black, she donned the floor-length 
black chador and veils of a Bedouin woman. But underneath she wore pants and 
sneakers "in case we had to run." 
</P>
<P>
She and about 70 others set out in a convoy of 13 vehicles across the desert, 
she said. Among them was Rimdzius' friend, Stephanie McGehee, 37, an Associated 
Press photographer from Leucadia, Calif., who is fluent in several Arabic 
dialects. McGehee was able to talk the convoy past several Iraqi checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Another Californian who escaped Kuwait, Peter Burrell of the Bay Area town of 
Walnut Creek, was home Wednesday night but his wife said he did not want to 
comment on the escape. A spokesman for Burrell's employer said the 
air-conditioning firm did not want any statement made for fear of endangering 
employees still in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers turned Rimdzius' convoy back when it first tried to drive into the 
desert from the Kuwaiti capital. They pretended to obey and head back to the 
city, but after driving a short distance, turned back into the blistering white 
sands again. 
</P>
<P>
When the convoy passed a cluster of tanks, Rimdzius swallowed her wedding ring. 
"It was very important to me," she said. "I didn't want to lose it." 
</P>
<P>
They were allowed to pass, but soon came upon another group of tanks, Rimdzius 
said. "We didn't know if they'd shoot or smile," she said. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't shoot. 
</P>
<P>
After about two hours of grueling driving, the convoy crossed out of Kuwait and 
reached Khafji, Saudi Arabia, where a fort had been converted into a center for 
refugees fleeing the Iraqis. They were fed huge platters of rice and lamb, and 
the Saudis had set up a hospitality tent where the group was given money, Sara 
Lee cakes and orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
The next day they drove to the tiny Persian Gulf state of Bahrain, where they 
organized their trips back home. 
</P>
<P>
Rimdzius' family in Long Beach had anxiously awaited her return for more than a 
week. A yellow ribbon is still tied to the big pepper tree outside their home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad she had the sense to get the hell out when she did," said her 
father, Cliff Wilcott. "There's going to be an awful lot of blood shed over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
After a family dinner welcoming her back, Rimdzius went home with her daughter, 
Kim Reuschell, a 27-year-old Long Beach secretary.

92 ALIENS HELD FOR RANSOM FOUND; 
</P>
<P>
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: THEY ARE DISCOVERED CRAMMED INTO A LA PUENTE HOUSE. SEVEN 
ALLEGED SMUGGLERS ARE ARRESTED.

More than 90 Salvadoran and Mexican illegal immigrants were found crammed into 
a small home in La Puente on Wednesday, held captive by seven men who smuggled 
the aliens into the United States but then refused to release them unless a 
ransom was paid. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, acting on a tip, stormed the one-story 
house in the 15000 block of Amar Road Wednesday afternoon and discovered the 92 
aliens -- among them about half a dozen children. 
</P>
<P>
The seven smugglers, known as coyotes, were arrested, and the illegal aliens 
were turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to be sent back 
to their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the largest groups of illegal aliens in Southern California to be 
rescued from smugglers, who are increasingly trying to extort money from 
relatives on this side of the border, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the smugglers were demanding that relatives pay up to $1,000 for 
the release of each alien, many of whom had already paid $1,000 or more for the 
perilous trip north to Los Angeles, Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
Even as deputies searched the house, frantic relatives were still calling, 
offering to pay the ransom. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone hasn't stopped ringing since we got here," said Sgt. T. J. 
Hageboeck. "People are calling in saying they have the $500 or the $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
Officers also took a call from an employment agency looking for potential 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said dozens of people had been locked inside one 8-by-20-foot room. 
Others were locked inside the three small bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible place," said Deputy Rich Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
For much of Wednesday afternoon, the 92 people found in the house sat 
somber-faced on the front lawn while deputies and INS agents asked questions. 
Two black-and-white buses finally arrived to take the group away. 
</P>
<P>
The aliens were turned over to the INS and were to be sent back to their 
countries, Olmstead said. This practice of handing rescued illegal aliens over 
to the INS has been challenged in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The seven smugglers were arrested, booked on suspicion of extortion and related 
charges and taken to the City of Industry sheriff's station. Nearly $19,000 in 
cash was also confiscated, most of it from one man. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the smuggling ring had probably been operating for some 
time, although many aliens in the group said they had been held in the house 
for only a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rollover, (an) ongoing process," Hageboeck said. "People were coming 
and going all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the house, empty soda cans and food were strewn about. An uncooked 
chicken was found in a cupboard. Aside from two couches and an armchair in one 
room, there was no furniture. Clothing and pillows covered the floor of one 
bedroom; a clothesline was stretched across another room. 
</P>
<P>
A woman whose nephew was being held in the group alerted authorities, Olmstead 
said. She told investigators she got a call Tuesday demanding $1,000 for her 
nephew's release. She agonized over whether to pay, then notified the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
As deputies stormed into the house after kicking in the front door, they 
frightened many of the people inside. "One lady was on her knees praying," Sgt. 
Charlie Araugo said. 
</P>
<P>
Around the neighborhood, several residents said the activities at the house 
rarely aroused suspicion before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I always saw people coming and going, cars arriving full of people," said Juan 
Guardado, owner of the Mexicali Restaurant across the street. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed strange, but you never know. I never even imagined what was 
happening there."

Pope John Paul II, in his first public comment on the crisis caused by Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait, spoke Wednesday of the "danger of war" and offered a prayer 
for peace. 
</P>
<P>
During his weekly general audience the Pope spoke about the threat to world 
peace, addressing a small group of Japanese pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we add to our prayers the danger of a war that threatens the desired 
peace in the world," the Pope said in Japanese. "May the Lord, through the 
intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, answer our invocations. With this 
wish, I bless everyone from my heart."

A Canadian has been arrested for the second time this month on charges of 
attempting to perform a stunt at Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Peter E. DeBernardi, 43, was arrested Tuesday near the base of the Horseshoe 
Falls in Ontario and charged with criminal trespass and attempting to perform a 
stunt on park property, said a Niagara parks police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not elaborate on DeBernardi's planned stunt. The Buffalo News, 
quoting unidentified sources, said DeBernardi had a length of rope with him and 
speculated that he might have planned to try repeating a 1988 stunt in which he 
rappelled into the gorge at the base of the falls. 
</P>
<P>
DeBernardi and two other men were arrested last week in Niagara Falls, N.Y.

Wind-driven fires that gutted at least 22 homes and forced thousands of Riviera 
vacationers to flee continued to burn out of control in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements arrived from all over the nation as authorities declared a state 
of emergency. A 42-year-old volunteer firefighter died near Nice when heat 
caused the tires of his firetruck to explode and the vehicle rolled over. 
Farther east, in the Var, 1,200 firefighters and 300 soldiers battled flames 
that have destroyed at least 10 homes and consumed more than 20,000 acres of 
dense brush.

Colombian security police said they arrested the leader of the assassins of the 
Medellin cocaine cartel, striking a key blow in the country's war on drugs. The 
Administrative Security Department (DAS) said it apprehended Humberto de Jesus 
Parra Salinas, believed to be the leader of up to 100 gangs of hired gunmen, in 
a house in Medellin, where Colombia's most powerful cocaine cartel is situated. 
The police said they had also detained a Spanish citizen and head of a local 
security firm, who the DAS said was suspected of doing work for the cartel.

POLICE TO BARRICADE WESTWOOD VILLAGE; 
</P>
<P>
CROWDS: VEHICLE TRAFFIC WILL NOT BE ALLOWED INTO THE AREA ON WEEKEND NIGHTS 
BECAUSE OF CONGESTION AND GROWING VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Westwood Village, and busy Westwood Boulevard, will be blocked off to vehicle 
traffic on weekend nights in the wake of a melee three weeks ago in which nine 
people were arrested and three people injured, city officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend night crowds have gotten so large and unruly that police had to declare 
an unlawful assembly and clear the entire Westwood Village area four times in 
the last year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this weekend, Aug. 24, all streets into Westwood Village will be 
closed on Friday and Saturday from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Currently, most streets 
into the village are closed on those nights, but only from 9:30 p.m. to 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Westwood Boulevard, the main artery through the area, had stayed 
open throughout the weekend but now will be shut to traffic during the 
specified hours, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials rank the intersection of Westwood and Wilshire 
boulevards as among the busiest in the city -- if not the busiest -- traffic 
engineers determined that shutting down Westwood Boulevard would not worsen the 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who represents the district, said street workers will take special 
pains to close off Westwood at Wilshire last, putting other barriers in place 
beforehand. The councilman said that might push the actual closure time of that 
intersection closer to 8 p.m. -- after rush-hour traffic disperses. 
</P>
<P>
On any given day, 100,000 cars on Wilshire alone pass through the intersection, 
Yaroslavsky said, and thousands more travel down Westwood Boulevard on their 
way to UCLA, Westwood Village or the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The village is too small to accommodate the combination of foot traffic and 
vehicular traffic that crowds in on weekend nights and, during certain hours, 
cars are just going to have to give way to people," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department requested the street closures, and increasing 
complaints about overflow crowds and violence helped city officials override 
protests by some area merchants, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 3, it took nearly three hours to quell a disturbance that police said 
broke out about 10:30 p.m. Dozens of youths began fighting, police said, and 
some ran through the crowds randomly punching and robbing people. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, authorities are becoming increasingly concerned that gang 
members from other parts of the city are moving into Westwood Village on 
weekend nights, confronting each other and causing congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal shooting of an innocent bystander in 1988 drew national attention to 
the fact that gangs were moving out of their traditional inner-city turf and 
spreading into affluent areas. The victim, Karen Toshima, was window-shopping 
with friends when she was struck by a stray bullet during a skirmish between 
two rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Westwood Village merchants had opposed traffic restrictions, first 
implemented in June, 1988, and then scaled back several times to allow more 
vehicle traffic through. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a cautious appreciation of the city's taking a position to protect the 
pedestrian environment," said Scott Regberg, executive director of the Westwood 
Village Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Westwood Village can still use a shuttle service that runs 
constantly from the parking lot of the federal building on Veteran Avenue south 
of Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware it will create a hardship for some businesses, but it will be a 
boon to others," said Yaroslavsky. "We have to look out for the health and 
welfare of the whole village and the people who visit it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY CONSIDERS ASSAULT CHARGE AGAINST 
BRIDGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A jury began its first full day of deliberations Wednesday in the assault 
retrial of actor Todd Bridges, charged with shooting a drug dealer eight times 
inside a cocaine rock house last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court jury received the case late Tuesday, but met for 
only a few minutes and most likely did little more than select a foreman. The 
panel recessed for the evening and returned to court Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Bridges, 24, a former child star of the television sitcoms 
"Diff'rent Strokes" and "Fish," could be sentenced to up to four years in state 
prison.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRAFFIC OFFICER TAKEN FOR RIDE ON CAR HOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city traffic officer in the process of writing a ticket was taken for a ride 
around the Wilshire district Tuesday night when he jumped on the hood of a car 
to avoid being hit by the car's angry owner. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Portillo, a Department of Transportation officer, was issuing a ticket 
for an expired registration on a 1988 red Honda when the car's owner, John 
Turk, threatened to run over him, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A frightened Portillo jumped onto the car's hood to get out of the way. 
Portillo, 21, held onto the hood and the windshield wipers as the car sped 
around the neighborhood. At one point Turk turned the wipers on, Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
While clinging to the hood, Portillo managed to pull out his radio and alert 
Los Angeles police. Turk was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, police 
said.

SEX HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS BY FEMALE CITY WORKERS DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of female Los Angeles city employees being sexually harassed has 
declined slightly in the last three years, and the perpetrators have more often 
been co-workers than superiors, according to a city survey presented to a City 
Council committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The number of women reporting harassment dropped from 36% in a 1987 study to 
31% in a 1989 follow-up survey, with the majority of respondents saying they 
were harassed by co-workers, said Susan J. Rose, executive director of the 
city's Commission on the Status of Women, which conducted the surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the City Council's Human Resources and Labor Relations Committee, 
Rose said the decrease in the incidence of sexual harassment, along with the 
decline in harassment by supervisors, indicated steps taken after the 1987 
study succeeded in educating employees about sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The July, 1989, survey was a follow-up to a 1987 survey. That study found that 
70% of all women who did not report sexual harassment refused to do so because 
they thought it would do no good. More than 60% did not report the harassment 
out of fear of retaliation.

CITY ATTY. CALLS STAFF ADEQUATE;

<P>
LAWYERS: HAHN ORDERS REVIEW OF CASELOADS AFTER EMPLOYEES CLAIM THAT CIVIL 
LIABILITY UNIT IS UNDERSTAFFED. HE MAKES NO PROMISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn declared Wednesday that the city is receiving adequate 
representation in civil liability cases, despite claims to the contrary this 
week by a majority of his lawyers handling such cases. They say their unit is 
intolerably understaffed and underequipped. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Mayor Tom Bradley, Hahn wrote that he would undertake 
an immediate review of the caseloads of his liability lawyers, 28 of whom 
issued a statement this week saying that "we can no longer competently and 
adequately represent the best interests" of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said that the review would determine whether a redistribution of the 
workload or a reorganization of the staff is warranted. "The categorical 
assertion by these 28 attorneys that they are unable to represent the city 
competently is a serious admission," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But, citing the city's budget crunch, Hahn made no promise to follow up the 
attorneys' demands for additional secretaries, paralegals and computers. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Wednesday, eight of the lawyers who signed the statement said 
that conditions have deteriorated to the point that they cannot keep up with 
their workload of about 100 cases each. The result, they said, is higher costs 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seven cases set for trial between April 30 and June 4," said Assistant 
City Atty. Victoria G. Chaney. "I tried three of the seven and we had to settle 
the other ones. . . . One of the considerations for settlement in those cases 
was the fact there wasn't a body to try them." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those cases, had they been prepared earlier, or the attorney been 
better able to prepare them, some of them may have been disposed of in other 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
The liability lawyers, who defend the city in cases ranging from automobile 
accidents to wrongful deaths, released their petition at a time when the city 
is facing a major increase in costly legal settlements. After holding steady at 
about $15 million annually through the 1980s, settlements skyrocketed to $34 
million in fiscal 1989-90 and are increasing at an even quicker rate this year.

RON KOVIC CALLS FOR PULLOUT FROM GULF; 
</P>
<P>

<P>
In an open letter to President Bush, Ron Kovic -- the highly decorated Vietnam 
War veteran turned disabled anti-war hero -- called Wednesday for an immediate 
withdrawal of all U.S. troops sent overseas to counter Iraqi aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, whose autobiography was the basis for the movie "Born on the Fourth of 
July," was met by several counterdemonstrators who burned an Iraqi flag, 
picketed the rally and called the former Marine sergeant a traitor to his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
With the protesters outside, Kovic read aloud his long, impassioned plea to a 
crowd of about 100 activists who gathered in the Parish Church of St. Augustine 
by-the-Sea in Santa Monica to cheer him on. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic said the scenario of the United States threatening to go to war with a 
faraway aggressor evoked for him a terrifying and Angst-provoking sense of deja 
vu. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel like Alice, staring into the looking glass, seeing that same 
horror and nightmare about to repeat itself," Kovic said. "It is pure folly, 
Mr. President." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, 44, of Redondo Beach, was shot and paralyzed from the chest down while 
in Vietnam in 1968. The prominent anti-war activist maintained a low profile in 
recent years. He considered running for Congress earlier this year, but chose 
to eschew politics in favor of continuing his writing career. 
</P>
<P>
But Kovic said he felt obligated to speak out now because "very few voices have 
dared to speak in opposition," even as the brinkmanship between the United 
States and Iraq continues. "I hope and pray, Mr. President, that you have heard 
me today," Kovic said, "because I truly feel that I represent the conscience 
and hearts of millions of our people who have not yet chosen to speak." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a bank of television cameras and a score of reporters, Kovic 
implored the President to remember the lessons of Vietnam. "My life," he said, 
looking down at his wheelchair, "is a living example of the devastation and 
loss that can result from a miscalculated, deceptive and secret foreign 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Several others, including clergy members and radio personality Casey Kasem, 
also urged Bush to withdraw U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
Kasem said that he never took action to protest the Vietnam War but that he 
plans to speak out almost daily against the current troop deployment, "to make 
up for what I didn't do then." 
</P>
<P>
In a private interview, Kasem, whose parents are from Lebanon, said many of the 
300,000 Arab-Americans in Los Angeles share his opposition to the troop 
deployments. "They are concerned," Kasem said. "They don't want to see American 
boys die for oil." 
</P>
<P>
Arab-Americans also do not understand why the United States went to the aid of 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia after it stood by when Israeli troops invaded Lebanon 
in 1982, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kasem scolded Hollywood for stereotyping Arab-Americans with "an image that an 
Arab is less than human, that he is a billionaire, a bomber, a belly dancer, 
someone not to be trusted. That kind of mind-set allows us to send our 
(American) boys to protect oil in the (Persian) Gulf and not be concerned with 
the human factor." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the rally, Robert Zirgulis, a West Los Angeles business consultant, was 
among the handful of flag-waving and sign-carrying demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Zirgulis, who said he was from the International Human Rights Watch group, said 
he has been angry at Kovic since he saw him speak at UCLA in 1971. "We consider 
Ron Kovic a self-pitying crybaby. He doesn't care about American soldiers," 
Zirgulis said. 
</P>
<P>
Another counterdemonstrator, Michael Wallin, said: "I think Ron Kovic is a 
traitor. He is using his popularity to capitalize on his political beliefs. 
Just like Jane Fonda." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic said he will travel to the White House to hand-deliver the letter to Bush 
if a faxed copy sent Wednesday does not elicit a response. "I speak out not 
because I am disloyal, but because I love this country," he said.

SURF AND TOUGH TURF: LIFEGUARDS ON THE BEAT;

<P>
CRIME: ACCUSTOMED TO FIGHTING RIPTIDES, SOUTHLAND LIFEGUARDS ARE NOW BATTLING A 
RISE IN GUNS, BRAWLS AND BOOZE.

<P>
The lifeguard with the pistol on his hip and the handcuffs on his belt slammed 
his Jeep to a shuddering stop and peered into the 9 p.m. darkness. He bolted 
out the door and crouched five feet from his prey. 
</P>
<P>
"Get out of there now, you . . . " lifeguard Rick Reisenhofer screamed at the 
man. "If you don't crawl out of there in 10 seconds, I'm gonna kill you." The 
man crawled out from the brush behind lifeguard headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
How did Reisenhofer see his man in the dark? "His neon shorts gave him away," 
the lifeguard said with a laugh. He handcuffed the man, sat him on the ground 
and went off to interview witnesses to a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Just another Friday night at Bolsa Chica State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun sets and the families pack up to leave the beach, their places are 
taken by a different crowd, one drawn mainly by the fire rings that line the 
sand and offer the chance for nighttime barbecues, starlit evenings, good 
fellowship -- and the occasional fight. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty yards from the point where the man in the fluorescent pink swimsuit 
allegedly broke a bottle over a stranger's head, two dozen young men and women 
from the Berendo Street Baptist Church in Koreatown discussed theology around a 
blazing fire. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from them, a similar-sized congregation from the Open Bible Church in 
Pico Rivera sang hymns in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the beach, families gathered for reunions, friends barbecued 
hamburgers, men and women cuddled in sleeping bags and co-workers celebrated 
the end of another week, often by hoisting a beer or two while waiting for the 
hot dogs to cook. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol is allowed at two state beaches in Orange County that are open at night 
-- Bolsa Chica and Huntington -- and the lifeguards say that is a main cause of 
their problems. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago , a lifeguard stopped Nicholas Joseph Caliri Jr. just past midnight 
at an exit from Huntington State Beach on suspicion of drunk driving. After the 
lifeguard returned to his car to check Caliri's license and to see if there 
were any warrants for his arrest, Caliri fired two pistol shots at the 
lifeguard, police said. The lifeguard ducked and returned the fire, killing 
Caliri. 
</P>
<P>
The fire rings, the booze and other attractions can draw almost 20,000 people 
to Huntington and Bolsa Chica beaches on a good Friday night, lifeguards say. 
At times, all 5,000 parking spaces at the two beaches are full and scores of 
cars wait outside on Pacific Coast Highway for a space to open. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County has only about 20 fire rings, all at Dockweiler Beach, just 
south of Los Angeles International Airport, and doesn't allow alcohol, said 
County Lifeguard Capt. Tom Viren. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol has been prohibited on Los Angeles beaches, except for special permits 
issued for occasions like weddings, for at least 15 years, lifeguards said. 
That ban has worked to "reduce the number of drownings we've had" along the 31 
miles of beach and to "reduce the tensions on the beach," Viren said. 
</P>
<P>
But even without the lure of booze, on a good Friday night in the summer, 
25,000 to 30,000 people may show up on the beaches around Santa Monica and 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County lifeguards don't carry guns, although they are allowed to 
arrest people for violating beach rules, Viren said. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards at beaches operated by Orange County cities don't carry guns either, 
officials said, but the state beach permanent lifeguards do. With their blue 
uniforms, guns, nightsticks and handcuffs, they function more as cops who also 
happen to swim than as lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Sforza, 30, looks like a walking advertisement for a lifeguard -- with his 
blond good looks, 6-foot, 175-pound frame and Wayfarer sunglasses -- as he 
starts his evening shift. 
</P>
<P>
But he looks more like a cop when he puts the navy blue trousers on over his 
red bathing suit, checks his .38-caliber revolver and makes sure the Remington 
shotgun in his car is ready for action. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 p.m., the beach is peopled by the day-crowd stragglers. Men and women play 
football, volleyball and paddle ball; they toss Frisbees and softballs. 
Bicyclists, joggers and an occasional person in a wheelchair stake out their 
spots on the concrete walking path. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sun sets, Sforza cites one man for having his dog on the beach and 
takes a 21-year-old from Glendale off to the Huntington Beach police station 
for a breath test. That occurs after Sforza watches the man toss a bottle of 
beer from the Volkswagen van he is driving. He had spotted Sforza's Dodge 
Diplomat with flashing lights on top pulling up behind him. 
</P>
<P>
The man passes the breath test at the police station; Sforza drives him back to 
the beach to get the van. When it doesn't start, another lifeguard tells him he 
can leave it overnight this one time, but to get it out of there in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the sun sets, fires are burning in most of the 550 concrete rings 
dotted at 10-yard intervals along the beach. The scene looks eerily Cro-Magnon, 
resembling a caveman's luau. 
</P>
<P>
While Sforza is seeing about Glendale man's breath test, Reisenhofer and the 
other seven lifeguards on night duty patrol the sand, the parking lots and the 
jogger-bicycler-pedestrian strip. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl involving the man in the neon-colored shorts, Gregory Hurst, 20, 
started as many do. Lifeguards said Hurst apparently had too much to drink, 
lurched over to a family of half a dozen or so gathered around the fire and 
started cursing them. 
</P>
<P>
His friends from a U.S. Navy ship in Long Beach pulled him back. But he 
eventually found his way to the family again, investigators said. He allegedly 
insulted one woman. The family got irate. A fight began. Hurst allegedly hit 
one of the family men over the head with a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
With fireworks from the Queen Mary visible across the water, Reisenhofer got to 
the fight scene in time to see the neon bathing trunks disappear in a flash 
around the lifeguard headquarters at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
One lap in the Jeep, then another, and Reisenhofer spotted the man. Paramedics 
treated the injured, though no one was hospitalized. Lifeguards put Hurst in a 
lifeguard car and took him to Orange County Jail, where felony suspects are 
held. The charge: assault with a deadly weapon. Hurst's friends were told to go 
back to their ship. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole beach is known for fights, gangs, alcohol," one lifeguard said. But 
another put a better face on things, contending that the majority of people on 
the beach at night cause no trouble. Still, even the optimist agreed that "It's 
an urban beach with urban problems." 
</P>
<P>
The killing of Caliri was the first fatal shooting by a lifeguard in state 
beach history and the second one ever by an on-duty state Parks and Recreation 
Department officer. The previous incident occurred in November at Lake Perris 
Recreation Area in Riverside County. A state ranger shot an unarmed auto 
burglary suspect after a chase, and the Riverside County district attorney's 
office determined that the shooting was justified. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Roggenbuck, district superintendent for the Parks and Recreation 
Department, said that so far this year lifeguards have confiscated nearly a 
dozen firearms from visitors at Huntington, Bolsa Chica and Crystal Cove State 
Park beaches. Crystal Cove, in southern Orange County, isn't open at night. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, lifeguards at the beaches arrested 198 people and issued 1,000 
citations, Roggenbuck said, with most of the action coming on the 4 1/2 miles 
of Huntington and Bolsa Chica beaches; 100 of the arrests were for driving 
under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
Roggenbuck, who started his career as a lifeguard at Huntington state beach in 
1967, said alcohol has been allowed as long as he can remember. The situation 
may change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About eight years ago, possession and consumption of booze was banned from the 
northern quarter of Bolsa Chica beach after numerous arrests for intoxication 
and fights, he said. Glass containers are banned too, after too many people cut 
their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we don't condone consumption to the point of inebriation or 
intoxication, where you're impaired to drive a car," Roggenbuck said. And he 
added that at summer's end, he and other district officials will "look into our 
problems" and decide whether alcohol should be banned completely. 
</P>
<P>
Some beach-goers "want to have a nice cocktail on the beach with a barbecue," 
Roggenbuck said. "Certainly I've done that with my family." If there is a 
prohibition of booze, "I'd have to change my lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
But Roggenbuck said problems arise when "one cocktail becomes 10, becomes 20," 
and the drunks become a danger to themselves and people around them. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of guns confiscated worries him too, Roggenbuck 
said. State parks and recreation officers began carrying guns in the mid-1970s 
as violence spread from the cities to the beaches, according to George Cook, 
deputy regional director of state parks and recreation in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Roggenbuck said the problems on the beach -- drinking, fights, occasional 
attempted rapes -- have been the same over the years, but now "it appears the 
numbers are increasing." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it just says something about today's society in general," Roggenbuck 
said. Certainly "more people are carrying guns because there are more weird 
things happening." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, people still flock to the beach at night. At 10:30 p.m., 
1 1/2 hours before closing time, drivers were still paying $4 to park. Sforza 
and other lifeguards questioned a 15-year-old girl who said she had run away 
from her home in Los Alamitos a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The girl said a man in his 30s joined her in Huntington Beach and they began 
walking north to a fast-food restaurant at the northern exit of Bolsa Chica 
State Beach. But after the man tried several times to get her to accompany him 
into a dressing room, she broke away. She said she felt threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards phoned the girl's home, then set out to search for the man. Sforza 
came across a man who fit the description the girl had given. He had a good 
story and would have been freed, but a check turned up one warrant for drunk 
driving and others for traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
Sforza told the man that because it was a bench warrant issued by a judge, he 
had to cart him off to jail. For the second time that night, the lifeguard made 
the pilgrimage to the Huntington Beach city jail. 
</P>
<P>
But at 1 a.m., when he radioed back from the jail to the beach, all was quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards were getting the last stragglers off the beach, ticketing the cars 
that hadn't cleared out, and getting ready to close up shop until 6 a.m., when 
the beach would reopen and a whole new crowd would appear.

JACK SMITH: TO WIT: THIS COLLECTION OF HUMOR IS ONE FOR THE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Dear Wit: Letters from the World's Wits" (Prentice Hall), H. Jack Lang 
gives us a treasury of written wit collected over 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Wit is not easily defined, but James Thurber came close when he observed that 
"The wit makes fun of other persons; the satirist makes fun of the world; the 
humorist makes fun of himself." 
</P>
<P>
In his introduction, Lang notes that wit is often caustic -- it has a victim; 
but it may also be wise and even gentle. He offers examples of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
I quote from the book without attention to categories, but mostly I have sought 
out the briefest forms. As someone has said, brevity is the soul of wit. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I favor the shafts that have victims. George Bernard Shaw once received 
this invitation from Winston Churchill's mother: "Lady Randolph Churchill will 
be home on Thursday afternoon, next, at four o'clock. RSVP." To which Shaw 
replied: "So will George Bernard Shaw." 
</P>
<P>
But the devilish Shaw was outwitted by actress Cornelia Otis Skinner in this 
exchange after the New York opening of Shaw's "Candida," in which she played 
the lead. Shaw cabled: "Excellent, greatest!" She replied: "Undeserving such 
praise." Shaw answered: "Meant the play." She shot back: "So did I." 
</P>
<P>
A professor at Western Reserve University asked Bertrand Russell to fill out a 
long and personal questionnaire. Russell replied: "If this is a specimen of 
Western reserve, God spare me from Western impudence." 
</P>
<P>
A young woman who had submitted some of her short stories to Somerset Maugham 
for criticism asked him, "Do you think I should put more fire in my stories?" 
He answered. "No. Vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
Winston Churchill was irrepressible. At a dinner he asked his American hostess, 
"May I have a breast?" She explained that in America one asked either for white 
meat or dark meat. The next day Churchill sent her an orchid with this note: "I 
would be most obliged if you would pin this on your white meat." 
</P>
<P>
The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke received a cable from William 
Randolph Hearst: "Is there life on Mars? Cable thousand words." Clarke cabled 
back: "Nobody knows. Repeat 500 times." 
</P>
<P>
When a female admirer asked the playwright Richard Sheridan to explain the 
essential difference between men and women, he answered: "I cannot conceive." 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorites is Cary Grant's answer to a cable from an anonymous 
magazine editor asking "How old Cary Grant?" Grant replied: "Old Cary Grant 
fine. How you?" 
</P>
<P>
Another movie classic is Groucho Marx's reply to an invitation to join a 
private club: "I do not wish to belong to the kind of club that accepts people 
like me as members." 
</P>
<P>
When a young woman asked Abigail Van Buren if birth control pills were 
tax-deductible, Dear Abby replied: "Only if they don't work." 
</P>
<P>
After an accident in which she lost a leg, the divine Sarah Bernhardt received 
this cable: "We offer you 100,000 dollars to exhibit your leg at our Exposition 
in Buffalo." To which she answered: "Which one?" 
</P>
<P>
An admirer of Sinclair Lewis wrote the famous writer, asking for a job as his 
secretary, and promising to "do everything for you -- and when I say everything 
I mean everything." Lewis' wife, the redoubtable Dorothy Thompson, answered: 
"My husband already has a stenographer who handles his work for him. And, as 
for 'everything,' I take care of that myself -- and when I say everything I 
mean everything." 
</P>
<P>
Successful authors often receive manuscripts from unpublished writers, asking 
for their criticism. Samuel Johnson once advised one young man: "Your work is 
both good and original. But the part that is good is not original. And the part 
that is original is not good." 
</P>
<P>
The British statesman Benjamin Disraeli had a standard answer to all such 
appeals: "Many thanks. I shall lose no time reading it." 
</P>
<P>
The French playwright Georges Courteline received a crude note from an impudent 
young writer demanding satisfaction for a minor insult. The note was filled 
with misspelled words. Courteline replied: "As I am the offended party, the 
choice of weapons is mine. We shall fight with orthography. You are already 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
Will Rogers starred in the Ziegfeld Follies during World War I. A young woman 
wrote him: "Why aren't you in the Army?" Rogers replied: "For the same reason, 
Madam, that you aren't in the Follies -- physical disabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Actress Ilka Chase's marriage to actor Louis Calhern ended after six months. He 
soon remarried, and Ilka sent the new bride a box of unused calling cards, 
engraved "Mrs. Louis Calhern," with this note: "Hope these reach you in time." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is not wit, but the most charming line in the collection is in a 
very brief essay written by Maria Taft, daughter of William Howard Taft III, in 
response to her teacher's request for a brief family history. 
</P>
<P>
Maria wrote: "My great-grandfather was President of the United States. My 
grandfather was Senator from Ohio. My father is Ambassador to Ireland. I am a 
Brownie."

BOOKS: THE AUTHOR OF 'THE MOTHER TONGUE' SAYS THE U.S. SHOULDN'T MINCE WORDS IN 
DEALING WITH IRAQ. HE APPLAUDS PRESIDENT BUSH'S USE OF THE 'H' WORD: HOSTAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the Persian Gulf crisis escalated, Bill Bryson didn't have much chance to 
keep up with the news. 
</P>
<P>
But the traveling author and expert on English usage did notice one thing as he 
bounced through airports, checked into hotels and waited to be interviewed at 
radio stations. Namely, the initial reluctance of the U. S. government to label 
its citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
For Bryson, who freely admits he is no expert on the nuances of diplomatic 
speaking, it was another example of "mincing words in a way that isn't 
necessary." So, when President Bush finally used the "H" word in a speech 
earlier this week, Bryson saw it as a welcome meshing of language with reality. 
He applied the same reasoning to the quibbling over whether the cutoff of 
supplies to Iraq was or was not a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"That's precisely what they are doing," he said. "The Iraqis are holding 
hostages and the United States responded with a blockade." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson also noted that diplomatic niceties weren't observed when Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein and Bush described each other. Each head of state 
chose the same epithet, liar, to describe his enemy. 
</P>
<P>
To the Iowa-born writer who has lived in Great Britain for the last 15 years, 
the crossed words over the Middle East are only the latest go-round in a long 
scrutiny of the English language. Even before he ever thought of writing "The 
Mother Tongue: English &amp; How It Got That Way," Bryson, 38, admits to being 
a "random" collector of tidbits about the language. 
</P>
<P>
With the publication of "The Mother Tongue," Bryson demonstrates that he has 
concentrated this previously unfocused penchant into a potential career. The 
book is a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, a latter-day Eldorado 
for writers and publishers. Moreover, the book has been widely and favorably 
reviewed by critics charmed by Bryson's mixing of voluminous research with a 
humorous, anecdotal style. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the book opens with the dry comment, "More than 300 million 
people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to." 
</P>
<P>
In the next paragraph, Bryson quotes an announcement found in a hotel in 
Yugoslavia: "The flattening of underwear with pleasure is the job of the 
chambermaid. Turn to her straightaway." Then he cites a pseudo-English warning 
to drivers in Tokyo: "When a passenger of the foot heave in sight, tootle the 
horn. Trumpet at him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your 
passage, then tootle him with vigor." 
</P>
<P>
Much further along -- toward the end of the book, in fact -- Bryson's chapter 
on swearing notes that in the 19th Century, an "outburst of prudery . . . swept 
through the world like a fever." In its wake, Victorians desperately fell to 
using anatomical euphemisms: stomach for belly; drumstick, first joint and 
white meat for the leg, thigh and breast of a chicken. Perhaps most extremely, 
bulls were called "gentlemen cows." 
</P>
<P>
While these examples may lack the sweep and majesty of the English language in 
the hands of a Churchill or Shakespeare, they fit the criteria laid down by 
Bryson for inclusion in his book: 
</P>
<P>
"Did it actually tell you something useful about the language or was it 
entertaining," he explains. "That was my whole idea, to share the delight and 
fascination with English that I have." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bryson's book is as full of factoids as a clear-cut forest is full of 
stumps. For instance, he reports that in his plays and poems, Shakespeare used 
17,677 words, "of which at least one-tenth had never been used before." His 
list of Shakespeare's word inventions includes leapfrog, monumental, castigate, 
hurry, pedant and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
While Bryson said he has no pretense of changing or enlarging the language, he 
admitted that writing the book made him something of a language liberal. 
</P>
<P>
"I have become less convinced that we have to be really strict in our usage of 
the language," he said. "For instance, one reviewer criticized me because I 
asked in the book 'who by and who for.' She pointed out it should be 'whom by 
and whom for.' I was aware that was the correct way it should be, but it seemed 
to me to write it 'whom by and whom for' would be incredibly pretentious and 
pompous." 
</P>
<P>
Such critics, he asserted, "fail sometimes to recognize that one of the glories 
of the English language is that it does grow and evolve and expand, and that it 
has this enormous flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "More and more I'm moving to the view that people are too fussy about 
the language. They think that proper English usage is a matter of learning a 
whole set of rules and blindly and arbitrarily following them. I think it's a 
lot more subtle than that." 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, however, Bryson cautioned that he is not a radical who can 
tolerate slipshod use of his mother tongue. "I think there's a great case for 
precision in the language, and we should respect distinctions between words, 
between imply and infer and flout and flaunt." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bryson maintained that his book is largely a work of reporting, not 
an opinionated essay. "There are not a whole lot of my own views in there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The tedium of objective research sometimes made Bryson slightly crazy. 
"Sometimes it felt like I was doing 20 college term papers all at once. It was 
homework," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the latter is right there in the back of the book, a select 
bibliography of more than 100 books on English, ranging from various 
dictionaries and histories of the language to "Sociolinguistics: An 
Introduction to Language and Society" and "A Dictionary of International 
Slurs." 
</P>
<P>
And it was homework in a literal sense for Bryson, who used to work for London 
newspapers but is now a free-lancer. He lives 250 miles from London and half an 
hour from "the nearest town with shops," he says. "By British standards, that's 
incredibly remote." 
</P>
<P>
Yet his isolation carries its own lesson about the huge variations -- and 
fierce parochialisms -- of the English language. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in this little dale in Yorkshire, a valley that's five miles long, and 
people swear they can tell that you were born up the dale or down the dale by 
the way you speak," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson himself has undergone an audible change since he moved to Britain in the 
mid-1970s. Although a native of the Midwest, his voice now hails from the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
When his accent is pointed out, he shrugs it off. "I know," he says with a hint 
of resignation. "It's been pointed out to me over and over again. The funny 
thing is, I resisted as consciously as I could giving up my American accent. I 
still pronounce words exactly as I did when I left home. I still say bath and 
banana and tomato (the way Americans do), and I don't say TEWsday, I say 
Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "I think the problem is that living over there for a long time, your 
cadence and your rhythms (of speech) all change."

1985, with its own saunas, gym and private cinema, but he used it only twice

Help!: Raymond and Michele L'Esperance, parents of the nation's first test-tube

to care for three more relatives. "We are elated," Raymond L'Esperance said 
Tuesday in Pontiac after his home had been approved for a foster-care license. 
The couple will receive about $1,000 monthly to care for their 6-, 10- and 
13-year-old nieces after the girls' parents sought drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation. The L'Esperances had quintuplets in 1988.

YOUR WHEELS: CAR'S PROBLEM DOES NOT COMPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I own a 1988 Pontiac Grand Prix that stalls when the car idles a long 
time in gridlock freeway traffic. I've talked to my dealer and he says nothing 
mechanically is wrong with the car. The computer shuts off the engine 
automatically when the catalytic converter reaches a high temperature. If the 
computer turns off the engine, why does it allow me to restart it immediately? 
The converter must still be at the same temperature. -- J.H. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The dealer was completely misinformed about the computer shutting down 
the engine if the catalytic converter reaches a high temperature. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, the dealer was concocting an explanation for something he does not 
understand. You have a potentially difficult to solve Catch-22 type engine 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Modern automobiles, including General Motors cars, have built-in diagnostics 
systems, in which a central computer detects when certain parts malfunction and 
can notify the driver through a check engine light on the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
But what happens when the computer malfunctions? Your GM computer may not know 
it is sick and it thinks it is doing you a favor by shutting down your car on 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the built-in diagnostics systems offered by car manufacturers so 
far have not been able to diagnose a faulty computer. It is even difficult for 
mechanics to check a computer, especially if the problem is intermittent. 
</P>
<P>
You need to find an enlightened dealer who is smart enough to call GM's 
technical service organization. One bit of caution: You should exercise to 
absolutely refuse to pay for a new computer on a trial-and-error basis. It 
could cost hundreds of dollars and it may not fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A neighbor who has about six cars parked next to my bedroom window starts 
the cars at very odd hours. Two of them are Mercedes-Benzes with diesel 
engines. He warms them up anywhere from 10 minutes to a half hour and even revs 
them up. He claims it will put too much stress on the engines if he does not 
warm them up. How long is it necessary to warm up a car? 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.M.K. 
</P>
<P>
A: Not only is your neighbor inconsiderate, but he is probably doing more 
damage than good to his cars by long warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Most automobile manufacturers recommend very short warm-ups during summertime 
temperatures. That means that you can begin driving, though gently, as soon as 
the engine is running smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota, for example, specifically cautions against lengthy warm-up idling and 
against any other long engine idling. General Motors cautions its owners that 
long idling poses a health risk from the possibile carbon monoxide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Engine oil begins to flow almost immediately after you start an engine. Within 
a minute, oil pressure should be stabilized. There is little or no benefit to 
waiting until the engine has reached operating temperature before starting out. 
</P>
<P>
In very cold subfreezing weather, a slightly longer warm-up is a good idea. But 
once the engine has idled for a few minutes, it should be safe to begin 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of revving a cold engine is potentially very harmful to an engine. 
By racing the engine at high speed, your neighbor is subjecting the engine to a 
maximum of wear and stress.

<P>
O.C. EATERIES THAT CATER TO THE AFTER-10 CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Let's get real. When it comes to late-night dining, we are not living in Madrid 
here. People in Orange County tend to dine at civilized hours. 
</P>
<P>
But though most local restaurants are empty by the time the clock strikes 10, 
the situation is not as hopeless as you might imagine. Let's say you've just 
seen a meaty performance by South Coast Repertory or a pithy 8 o'clock movie, 
and you want to sup in style. Or let's say you've been working until midnight 
on that impossible project, you're hot and grumpy, and you just want to roll up 
your sleeves and dive into a burger. You've got a baby-sitter you can trust or 
you don't have an appointment until 10 the next morning. And things were so 
frantic that you haven't eaten a thing since breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Well, surprise! There are restaurants of all shapes and sizes for after-hours 
dining in Orange County, where just about anything that strikes your fancy is 
being served. For this story, I've limited the choices to more familiar fare (a 
separate story spotlighting Asian restaurants is planned for a future date). 
Here is a short list of some noteworthy spots, and a few suggestions about what 
to eat in them. 
</P>
<P>
Bennie the Bum's Diner. Let's assume that, for now, the fancy stuff is more 
than you can handle. It's after midnight, and you've been working or doing some 
heavy partying. So you decide to head for the beach, and one of those oceanside 
diners like Edie's, Ruby's or any of the other late-night haunts that line 
Pacific Coast Highway clear up to Seal Beach. You clear your senses with a big 
whiff of that refreshing sea air, and then you head for Bennie the Bum's Diner. 
</P>
<P>
Bennie's is one of those '50s-style diners with belligerent cooks and singing 
countermen, where people sit bleary-eyed in the turquoise booths waiting for 
their burgers with fries. Singles sit on turquoise stools at the pink-topped 
counter, staring down the giant Coke sign and the pictures of celebrities named 
Joey (Joey Bishop, Joey Heatherton) while waiting for service. No one is 
holding his breath, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
The food at Bennie's is basic but solid. There are a variety of classic 
American sandwiches; the Reuben, Philly cheese steak, hot dogs, burgers, and a 
delicious BLT. The chili fries are classic, a giant portion smothered in 
Bennie's unctuous chili and gooey melted cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Get there before 11:30 or so and they'll cook you chicken, meat loaf, pork 
chops or other short-order specialties. If you request these dishes after 
midnight, the counterman had better like you a whole lot, or he'll abuse you 
verbally for daring even to ask. 
</P>
<P>
But there are always good milkshakes, a large selection of pies, a few soups 
and some soggy omelets. And the rather confused-looking crowd makes a fair bit 
of noise. In short, Bennie the Bum's provides all-American, late-night 
entertainment, sort of like the Letterman show with catering. But if you're 
after a classier establishment, read on. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennie the Bum's Diner, 238 Laguna Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4786. Open 24 
hours daily. Visa/MC. Food for two, $8-$18. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustav Anders. My unquestioned first choice for a late-night repast would be 
Gustav Anders, a sleek, sophisticated jewel of a restaurant that combines the 
spirit of a Paris bistro with the good sense of a Stockholm supper club. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is centrally located, close to the Performing Arts Center and 
the area's heaviest concentration of movie theatres. Dining there after hours 
is a joy. The restaurant's "anytime we are open" menu features just the kind of 
light fare that goes down easy in the wee hours: several caviars, various 
smoked fish, innovative salads and elegant sandwiches. There is a superb wine 
list, full of top-drawer California wines and hard to find French champagnes 
like Salon, Cristal and Perrier Grand Siecle. And service, always deft and 
casual, becomes more relaxed and soigne when the crowds thin down. 
</P>
<P>
Things are anything but sedate, however. The dining room is softly lit and its 
majestic beams recall a Scandinavian cottage. But a suave collection of art and 
sculpture makes the surroundings a challenge to the eye. And Thursday through 
Sunday, a pianist plays soft jazz, the better to sip champagne by and arouse 
your most primal instincts. 
</P>
<P>
Should you desire something stronger than champagne, Maitre'd Bill Magnuson 
(Gustav) has added an aquavit bord -- an hors d'oeuvres table featuring several 
of candinavia's celebrated, caraway-flavored liqueurs. The sharply lined, 
zinc-topped bar has been laden with goodies -- oysters on the shell, carpaccio, 
house-cured herring, gravlax, even smoked reindeer -- and the aquavits are 
potent and icy cold. It can all be had for one price, $22, a price I'd say was 
a steal. Just make sure someone else is driving home. Aquavit is definitely not 
for drivers, or wimps. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustav Anders in South Coast Plaza Village, the corner of Bear and Sunflower 
streets, Santa Ana. (714) 668-1737. Aquavit bord and bar menu served until 
midnight nightly. All major cards. Late supper for two (food only), $30-$60. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedar Creek Inn. Maybe you're after a bouncier setting, one where you can get 
lost in the crowd. And maybe the grand dining experience makes you want to gag 
at this hour. 
</P>
<P>
Well, at Cedar Creek Inn on Forest Avenue in downtown Laguna, you can sip, 
nibble, nosh and boogie to your heart's content, and you don't have to take it 
all so seriously. The restaurant is basically a rather conservative dinner 
house in the early evening, but after-hours it undergoes a Kafkaesque 
metamorphosis. Loud, live entertainment, mostly jazzy rock, is staged nightly. 
Don't come here for intimate conversation. 
</P>
<P>
It's a dark, clubby room with lots of beams, Tartan lamps and latticed windows 
draped with fussy, flower-print curtains. Sit at the oyster bar where hungry 
night owls hunker down, or at one of the small tables adjacent to the stage. 
The bar menu is always available after 10. 
</P>
<P>
The menu's basic focus is finger foods -- chicken strips, fried zucchini and 
sloppy, spicy nachos heaped with jalapenos. You can also have more upscale 
treats like fresh-shucked oysters, sashimi or crab cakes. Portions are 
substantial, not for those seeking a light snack. They certainly don't skimp on 
oil or batter, the heavier components. 
</P>
<P>
I recommend steamed clams, good and garlicky, or the big juicy burger, wrapped 
in paper like you'd get at a drive-in. Sweet tooths are in for quite a ride. 
There is a large dessert list filled with homemade goodies; Hershey Bar pie, 
boysenberry lush (a fruity cheesecake in a walnut crust), praline ice cream 
pie, and a brownie sundae topped with obscene amounts of whipped cream and hot 
fudge sauce. If that doesn't get you wide-eyed, the restaurant makes an 
intense, artful espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedar Creek Inn, 384 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-8696. Oyster bar 
menu served until about midnight. Visa/MC/Amex accepted. Supper for two (food 
only), $15-$25. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezzaluna. The artists among you should go for the brash, bright Mezzaluna, a 
new restaurant proving to be quite controversial. It's a New York-style Italian 
trattoria with New York-style prices, open just over one month, and initial 
reports seem to dwell on its noise and inconsistency. 
</P>
<P>
But the late-supper menu -- pizzas, focaccia, salads and desserts -- is a real 
winner. The pizzas and focaccia are made in a special, wood-fired oven 
constructed of yellow cotto brick, and the two dishes are as delicious as I've 
tasted anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It's an informally colorful place with a tile floor and walls full of 
lithographs depicting various interpretations of mezzaluna, half moon in 
Italian. Owner Romano Molfetta has tried to infuse the proceedings with some 
authenticity (sun-bleached servers make half-hearted attempts to pronounce the 
names of the dishes in Italian, while the managers dress like fashion models). 
</P>
<P>
Things quiet down after 10 here. You'll see well-heeled locals airing out 
trendy libations like Nonnino grappa (a heavyweight Italian brandy around $16 
dollars a shot), and couples exchanging loving glances over the marble-top 
tables. Pizzas are the thin-crusted, crispy type, with creative, unusual 
toppings. Pizza con scamorza e radicchio, with smoked mozzarella and lots of 
bittersweet radicchio, is terrific. Pizza with pancetta and onion is the 
perfect blend of sweet and salty. 
</P>
<P>
Focaccia, an oil-rubbed bread with various fillings, is also featured and comes 
in eight varieties. Try tonno, pomodoro e cipolla, with tuna, tomato and olive, 
or ragu di funghi, a wild-mushroom ragu. 
</P>
<P>
Wildly inventive desserts often miss the mark. A few of them, like melon mousse 
and carmelized pear tart, work well. But the house coffee is great, the 
cappuccino is foamy and the mood is stimulating. The jury is still out on 
Mezzaluna as a dinner house (for a full review, please see Page 24), but for 
late-night dining, it's a welcome, sorely needed addition to the local scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezzaluna, 2441 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-2004. Late-supper 
menu served from 10 p.m. to midnight, nightly. Visa/MC/Amex accepted. Supper 
for two (food only), $25-$40. 
</P>
<P>
The Arches. If you're on a really heavy date, ready to move in for the kill 
with someone, you'll probably want to sit real close in one of those dark, 
intimate booths that you can slide down into and practically disappear. The 
Arches, at the not-so-intimate junction of Newport Boulevard and Coast Highway, 
has just such appointments. It's been there since what sounds like forever -- 
1922, when the Romantic Period was still within memory. In case it is food you 
are after, the complete menu is available until 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It's a surreal, intimate room that glows a somber red from chandeliers that 
would look more appropriately placed in a New Orleans bordello, and the walls 
are covered with splashy murals. Waiters wear stiff tuxedoes and do lots of 
table-side cooking. After hours, almost everybody's wine bottles are upside 
down in the buckets. 
</P>
<P>
Give partial credit to the restaurant's killer wine list (since 1983, The Wine 
Spectator has honored the restaurant) and gaudy menu earmarked with refined 
elegance. Twenties-style dishes like lobster Thermidor and veal Cordon Bleu 
abound, plus exotica like frog legs, shrimp and crab curries, and the gamut of 
flambes. French-cut lamb chops are thick and juicy, and there is a luxuriant 
Caesar prepared on the cart served with garlic toasts. Most of the meats can be 
ordered with sides of Escoffier-style sauces like Madeira, Hollandaise and 
Bearnaise. Everybody takes the proceedings with the utmost seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Chez Cary has cooked its last meal, The Arches is about the closest 
you can come to anachronistic dining in Orange County. In the grand days, when 
late-night dining was the fashion, this may have been no more than just another 
dinner house. Today, it stands alone. An institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arches, Newport Boulevard at Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 645-7077. 
Service nightly until 1 a.m. All major cards. Late supper for two (food only), 
$50-$75. 
</P>
<P>
Belisle's. Finally, the late, late supper: breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Those few who stay out really late may not be looking for a romantic corner to 
swish claret in a crystal goblet, and they may not want to fight a crowd, 
either. Maybe they just want some eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County doesn't have a late-night deli for industry hipsters like 
Canter's on Fairfax, or terminally cool Hollywood-style hangouts where a dude 
in Ray-Bans thumps an electric bass until dawn. But it does have a spate of 
all-night coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
Belisle's is one you won't soon forget. It's a slice of Americana big enough to 
satisfy the most fulsome appetite, a metaphor for color and excess. If you can 
finish one of their super breakfasts, chances are you've been a very naughty 
camper that evening. If you can finish the Texas breakfast, 12 eggs and a 
26-ounce steak, the Rams could use another nose guard. 
</P>
<P>
Super breakfasts come with 32-ounce beverages, four eggs, a mountain of home 
fries and a choice of oversized hot cakes or biscuits with country gravy. A 
choice of meats is included too; like six or seven sausages, or a granite-sized 
slab of ham. 
</P>
<P>
If you must stray from breakfast fare, there are giant sandwiches, bottomless 
bowls of salad and complete dinners served on platters that must weigh 5 pounds 
apiece. I merely nibbled on the hot turkey sandwich, mostly bland sage dressing 
blanketed with a pasty yellow gravy. Meat loaf is a better choice, a crumbly, 
tasty loaf that you won't put a dent in. The barbecue is tasty too, 
particularly the beef ribs. Beef ribs at 3 a.m. are not everybody's idea of a 
nightcap. Most of us have to work in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Belisle's, 12001 Harbor Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 750-6560. Open 24 hours, 
daily. Visa/MC accepted. Breakfast for two, $25-$40.

CARLTON IS BACK, AND HE'S BETTER

The last 2 1/2 years have been a long and often difficult road for guitarist 
Larry Carlton. In April of 1988 he was inexplicably struck down by a gunshot 
while standing outside his Studio City home. The near-fatal bullet -- fired by 
a still-unknown assailant -- severed the carotid artery in Carlton's neck and 
disabled one of his vocal cords. For months there was a real question whether 
the nerve trauma, which extended into his left arm, would prevent him from ever 
playing the guitar again. 
</P>
<P>
But Carlton persisted. He and his wife Michele, both born-again Christians, did 
". . . a lot of praying," he says. Remarkably, Carlton was playing his 
instrument within the year. His voice, limited to a whisper for many months, 
slowly began to return. 
</P>
<P>
When he opens Thursday, Aug. 23, at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, 
Carlton's listeners will see and hear a reinvigorated performer. He is now 
playing at least as well, and perhaps better than he ever has. His solo work 
seems enriched and deepened -- the result, perhaps, of the many hours of 
technical practice and musical re-evaluation that were part of his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, in a performance at Universal Amphitheatre, Carlton took his recovery 
one step further by opening his show with a strongly stated vocal on a 
whimsical, blues-styled tune "Crazy Momma." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in three years that I've sung in public," he told his 
audience. The cheering crowd clearly confirmed that Carlton, feeling fine and 
once again moving forward with his career, is back on track and ready to roll. 
</P>

KID STUFF: ROOTIN', TOOTIN' ROMP; 
</P>
<P>
'PECOS BILL SHOW' BRINGS TALL TALES TO LIFE IN ANAHEIM 
</P>

<P>
If your kids can be noisier than buzz saws and rowdier than a pack of cowhands, 
tonight's their night to shine. 
</P>
<P>
'Long about sundown, that rootin', tootin' cowboy Pecos Bill will mosey into 
Anaheim's Pearson Park to present "The Pecos Bill Show," a romp through 
American folklore that brings youngsters face to face with a barrelful of 
colorful characters. Geared for preschoolers on up, the audience-participation 
show completes the park's "Just for Kids" series with a 7:30 p.m. performance 
in the park amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pecos Bill Show," presented by three members of the Imagination Company, a 
Los Angeles-based children's theater troupe, brings to life tall tales of the 
Old West in a series of short scenes. During the 40-minute show, audiences meet 
naturalist Johnny Appleseed and see Paul Bunyan match lumberjack skills with a 
city slicker, and Annie Oakely take on Frank Butler in a pea-shooting contest. 
To keep things hopping, Pecos lassoes audience volunteers who, aided by simple 
props and sound effects, are transformed into a whiring buzz saw, a couple of 
cowhands and even a shootin' match target. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Imagination Company shows, the success of "Pecos Bill" relies more 
on the active imaginations of children than it does on fancy props and 
costumes, said co-founder Tom Provenzano. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect children to fill in a lot of the blanks, and they always do it 
beautifully," said Provenzano, who formed the company in 1984 with actor-writer 
Teresa Love. "While there are a lot of good things about elaborately staged 
children's theater, this show brings the kids into a whole different kind of 
creative energy." 
</P>
<P>
Imagination Company may not be the most widely recognized children's group in 
the state, but it is among the busiest, Provenzano said. In the past seven 
years, the troupe, which ranges in size from 5 to 25 actors, has staged over 
3,000 performances primarily in Southern California schools. The group recently 
added a Northern California office and will soon offer shows in Washington, 
Oregon and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
As the group's artistic director, Love has created nearly 20 original plays 
geared for students in preschool through high school. In addition to "Pecos 
Bill," there are tributes to American leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., 
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Last year, the troupe premiered its 
first bilingual show, "Celebracion de Mexico," and in 1991 will salute the 
Chinese New Year with "Gung Hay Fat Choy, in the Year of the Goat." At all 
school performances, teachers receive study guides that suggest a variety of 
pre- and post-performance classroom activities. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Provenzano doesn't see this as an educational group. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is entertainment, with the understanding that everything in our 
shows is based on historical figures or classical literature. It's meant to be 
fun, but if we all learn something along the way, that's wonderful, too." 
</P>
<P>
What: "The Pecos Bill Show," presented by the Imagination Company. 
</P>
<P>
When: Thursday, Aug. 23, at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Pearson Park Amphitheatre, on Lemon Street between Lincoln and Sycamore 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: Riverside (91) Freeway to Harbor Boulevard, south on Harbor, east

Wherewithal: Adults, $2; children 3 to 12 and seniors, $1. Under 3 admitted 
free.

A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say "arrrgh" a lot

RESTAURANTS: HALF-MOON DESIGNS, PIZZAS THAT SHINE: MEZZALUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flavor of the Month among the new Italian imports is Mezzaluna, a New York 
franchise with Beverly Hills connections. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Aldo Bozzi, owner of the original Mezzaluna in New York, has 
franchises in Aspen and Beverly Hills in conjunction with a couple of Lebanese 
partners. Now along comes Bozzi's friend and countryman, Romano Molfetta, who 
disclaims affiliation with the Aspen and Beverly Hills locations but insists he 
is running an offshoot of the main restaurant in The Apple itself. Very 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when it becomes obvious that this location in Corona del Mar is just 
like the other three: a lively bar, a cafe with designer trimmings and a 
slightly specious theme. All the restaurants are dominated by a colorful series 
of framed prints done by various artists and illustrators which pay homage to 
the mezzaluna, or half-moon in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
This is a play on words. Mezzaluna means not only a fraction of the lunar disk 
but, more colloquially, a crescent-shaped chopper with wooden handles on each 
end, an indispensable tool for any Italian housewife. The restaurant has gone 
off the deep end a bit with this theme, even going so far as to put smiling 
half moon logos on all the menus and plates. It's as if the "have a nice day" 
thing had gone Mediterranean or something. Sheesh. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the trumped-up theme, though, I like the place. I wish I could say 
Molfetta had a resounding success on his hands, in fact, but up to now his 
reception has been rather lukewarm. Oh, there are certainly enthusiastic swarms 
of young Italians coming for the authentic pastas, not to mention a mysterious 
looking late night crowd wearing the latest fashions from Soho and Milan. But 
the locals just don't seem to get it. 
</P>
<P>
I can guess why. In Mezzaluna's noisy main dining room, you sit at 
marble-topped tables too close together for comfort, shifting about on wooden 
chairs that feel harder with each passing course. Downstairs, in a cozy, 
semiprivate room, you watch foccaccia and pizzas being shoveled in and out of a 
yellow tile oven while sitting at long tables that look almost medieval in the 
ochre light. 
</P>
<P>
In short, there's plenty of style but very little comfort in this restaurant. 
And this is certainly not Soho. Or Milan. 
</P>
<P>
But the menu is attractive enough, providing your taste runs to designer 
pizzas, Italian dishes you need a Berlitz course to pronounce or original stuff 
such as goose carpaccio and coffee zabaglione. You'll be tempted to start with 
something from the lengthy appetizer list, but move cautiously. Most of them 
are just decoys. 
</P>
<P>
The real target here is a mouthful: carpaccio di prosciutto d'oca parmigiano e 
olio tartufato. It's thin sliced goose topped with parmesan and truffled oil, 
and you simply cannot get enough of it. When you taste its delicate, lingering 
flavor, you may never be satisfied with beef as the main ingredient for this 
dish again. I ordered it all three times I ate in the restaurant, which I'm 
really not supposed to do. Don't spread it around. 
</P>
<P>
Other good appetizers are vitello tonnato, a credible version of the Tuscan 
classic consisting of cold roast veal in an unctuous tuna sauce, and a 
marinated dish of shrimps, beans and celery called insalata di gamberetti. The 
other cold appetizers, I'm afraid, just left me cold. 
</P>
<P>
But really, it's time to hurry on to the thin-crust pizzas and first-rate 
pastas. They are the most consistent courses in this restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Pizza con scamorza e radicchio is my personal favorite, a crisp pie oozing 
smoked mozzarella that is redolent of bittersweet radicchio -- a soaring 
combination. Pizza pugliese, with sweet onion and pecorino cheese, is another 
exotic winner, and the more mundane pizza Margherita, with fresh basil and 
tomato, its humble equal. 
</P>
<P>
Pastas are made fresh daily, and cooked strictly al dente, with a variety of 
sauces that compromise little to the American palate. Maccheroni integrali is 
an all-wheat pasta with a muscular bite, flavored strongly with olive puree, 
capers and tomato. Rigatoni with eggplant and ricotta is the kind of pasta dish 
that you dream about, a wonderfully soft version with an almost fluffy texture. 
But black linguine in spicy sauce seemed just plain tired, a gummy rendition 
with a generic, undefined sauce. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a restaurant where main courses are emphasized, and in fact the 
menu lists just five. All look appealing, but if you only choose one than make 
it the misto griglia, a seafood mixed grill consisting of slices of salmon, sea 
bass and swordfish blanketed with a tomato and olive concasse. It is executed 
to near perfection. 
</P>
<P>
There is a large and somewhat contrived dessert list which is a hit-or-miss 
proposition. The simpler ones, such as the caramelized upside down pear tart 
and the biscotti with vino santo, hit. Others, like a positively weird coffee 
zabaglione and a misplaced melon mousse with kiwi sauce, miss. 
</P>
<P>
The service is erratic, too, despite Signore Molfetta's efforts to be a 
gracious host. (He often treats his customers to shots of grappa at the bar.) 
One evening, I had a highly solicitous waiter who hailed from somewhere in 
Sicily. On another, I got stuck with someone who looked and sounded totally 
perplexed throughout the evening. Maybe there was a full moon that night. 
</P>
<P>
Mezzaluna is moderately expensive. Antipasti are $6.50 to $12. Primi piatti are 
$5 to 14. Griglia are $14 to $20. There is a very pleasant wine list with some 
excellent, low-priced Italian wines. Among the whites, try a bone-dry Arneis 
Ceretto for $27. Among the reds, enjoy the eminently drinkable Dolcetto d'Alba 
from Bruno Giacosa at $21.

families and a coloring book, above, written by Camp Pendleton wives to help 
children cope. . . . Titled "Daddy's Days Away," the book encourages kids to 
express their feelings, to write to daddy, to help mom with the chores. 
"Whether dad is at home or away, we are a family," the book says. . . . And why 
is dad going? "To protect and defend our country." Originally written for 
Pendleton Marines, the book is now distributed nationwide. Tom Hamilton and

PYGMY GOATS, OTHER TINY BEASTS MAY SOON BE ALLOWED IN ORANGE

Pygmy goats have yet to replace pot-bellied pigs as the latest in trendy pets, 
but they may soon be making their way to Orange homes if the City Council 
approves a "designer animal ordinance" to accommodate unusual pets. 
</P>
<P>
"You can walk them on a leash and teach them tricks and they all have a 
personality of their very own," said Stephen Heilman, 17, regional youth 
representative for the National Pygmy Goat Assn. "Once you've seen one, you 
can't imagine having anything else as a family pet." 
</P>
<P>
The miniature goats, which sell through breeders for $50 to $1,500, are cuddly, 
affectionate and make loyal pets, Heilman said. They are easily housebroken and 
love to be petted and bottle-fed. 
</P>
<P>
Heilman, a senior at Orange High School, became infatuated with pgymy goats 
shown at the 1985 Orange County Fair. By the following year, he had turned his 
infatuation into a business and now owns about 60 goats. He breeds them at a 
Corona horse ranch and has sold the pets to families and other breeders from 
the coast of Dana Point to the hills of Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
But under an Orange ordinance, the goats are considered livestock and not 
permitted in residential areas. Heilman is lobbying the City Council to amend 
the ordinance to allow for unusual pets such as miniature farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
All they require to be happy are a few pounds of alfalfa and goat ration -- a 
grain mix -- each day. A 20-by-10-foot pen can accommodate two goats. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're lonely, they'll jump the pen," Heilman said, "so we recommend a doe 
and a wether (a castrated male)." 
</P>
<P>
Pygmy goats stand just 16 to 20 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 50 to 80 
pounds. They are not genetically altered versions of the larger barnyard 
animals but an independent breed originating in Cameroon and Nigeria. The goats 
can be white, chocolate brown and jet black, with darker markings on their 
legs, face and back. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reputation of goats as living garbage disposals that devour tin 
cans, Heilman said pygmy goats are picky eaters who are partial to roses. 
</P>
<P>
Pygmy goats may be cleaner and more fun than pot-bellied pigs, but they are not 
ready to supplant the miniature pigs as the trendy yuppie pet of the moment, 
said George Starbuck, a former president of the National Pygmy Goat Assn. who 
raises the animals in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people are serious about (goats) and have two or three, and 
babies, and raise them in a semi-farm situation -- rather than in the back seat 
of their Mercedes," Starbuck said. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing requests throughout Orange County to allow animals like miniature 
horses, pot-bellied pigs and pygmy goats in residential neighborhoods are a 
signal that people are trying to hold on to rapidly vanishing rural roots, said 
Susan Tully, code enforcement supervisor for the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, there was a celebrated pygmy goat case in Costa Mesa where Arthur and 
Angela Raj Kumar were ordered to get rid of their pet. But after meeting Barney 
the pygmy goat, the council voted 4 to 0 to allow small farm animals in the 
city with a permit. 
</P>
<P>
While current laws in the city of Orange limit goats to agricultural zones or 
neighborhoods designed to accommodate the animals, such as Orange Park Acres, 
the council may consider passing a "designer animal ordinance" to regulate 
unusual pets like miniature livestock, Tully said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see where a pygmy goat is a whole lot different than a dog," Tully 
said. "In fact, they're kept more confined than dogs and cats so they're 
probably a lot less trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But Starbuck cautions that pygmy goats are not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see people have them in a condo or an apartment," he said. 
"They need fresh air and a lot of it. They have been successfully raised 
indoors, but I don't recommend it. Besides, a bale of alfalfa will make a mess 
in your house in a hurry." 
</P>

BUDGET: URAM WILL URGE SUPERVISORS TO USE UP TO $2.3 MILLION IN COUNTY MONEY TO 
MAKE UP FOR STATE BUDGET CUTS.

<P>
Giving his first detailed public response to state budget cuts, Orange County 
Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram said Wednesday that he is recommending 
that supervisors use up to $2.3 million in county funds to restore cuts in 
state funding for mental health and county clinics. 
</P>
<P>
But Uram indicated that hospitals and doctors will probably have to absorb more 
than $13 million in reduced state reimbursements to Indigent Medical Services, 
a program that gives care to the county's 24,000 "working poor" who do not 
qualify for Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"Public safety is a higher priority than health -- that's the considered 
opinion of the Board of Supervisors, the Legislature. That is the way they 
think," Uram said in remarks to the United Way Health Care Task Force, a 
coalition of leaders from community clinics, doctors, hospitals and nonprofit 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Uram said he believes that the county administrative office will recommend this 
week that funds for mental and public health receive local "bailout" money when 
the Board of Supervisors adopts a budget Aug. 29. The CAO's letter is expected 
to be made public Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"To avoid the trauma of layoffs, I think they're going to give me some money to 
do this," he told the task force. 
</P>
<P>
He added that if money is not restored to the state budget, cuts to mental 
health and some other health services "might double" in January. He noted that 
several bills have been introduced in Sacramento to restore health-care money, 
including one by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
After their meeting with Uram, task force members said that any cuts to the 
county's health budget are unacceptable, and several members argued that public 
health is as much a safety issue as crime. 
</P>
<P>
If Orange County residents "are really interested in public safety, they're 
going to have a really bad safety problem if people are ill," Barbara Talento, 
an associate professor of nursing at Cal State Fullerton, warned. "The measles 
problem last year is the tip of the iceberg." The nationwide measles epidemic 
killed two Orange County infants earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider could not be reached for comment, 
but Karen Davis, the office's administrative manager of finance, said Uram's 
comments on the CAO's recommendation represented "a potential . . . nothing is 
final." 
</P>
<P>
She said the recommendations will be made today or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Davis said, the Health Care Agency appears likely to take a 
$13.6-million cut in indigent medical care, a $3.7-million cut in mental health 
and an $800,000 cut in state monies that help fund public health operations. 
</P>
<P>
In related action, leaders of the Hospital Council of Southern California have 
mounted a major campaign to restore money to the Indigent Medical Services 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual "legislative alert" that was sent to 43 member hospitals Friday, 
council vice president S. Russell Inglish asked members to "write or call your 
county supervisors." Inglish urged that supervisors either vote to restore all 
IMS cuts -- or to give IMS a share of any funds generated by new fees. 
</P>
<P>
To resolve a projected $40-million county deficit, the board is considering 
imposing new jail-booking fees or property tax fees. Supervisors voted 
Wednesday to delay considering a jail-booking fee to cities, which officials 
say could raise $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals and the Orange County Medical Society view this issue (of IMS 
funding) as a critical public safety matter," said John Cochran III, Orange 
County area chairman for the council, which represents 43 hospitals here. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that four hospitals in the North County have had to close their 
emergency rooms in the last 16 months, Cochran, who is president of La Palma 
Intercommunity Hospital, said IMS reimbursements to county hospitals and 
doctors underwrite the hospital's already-strapped emergency care system.

COAST CITIES TO PRESS BID FOR DRILLING BAN; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: OFFICIALS, CONCERNED THAT THE PERSIAN GULF SITUATION MAY LEAD TO 
OFFSHORE PRODUCTION, WANT THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ACTION TURNED INTO A LAW.

<TEXT>
<P>
Worried that oil companies may use the threat of war in the Middle East to try 
to increase oil exploration off the California coast, Orange County coastal 
cities have agreed to step up lobbying efforts in Congress for a legally 
binding, 10-year moratorium on offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Although President Bush this summer ordered a 10-year ban on new offshore 
drilling leases, local officials said Wednesday that the moratorium must be 
made into law because the executive action is not legally binding and can be 
undone by Bush or a future President. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to do something that's more than just a presidential press 
release, because we have read his lips before," Laguna Beach Councilman Robert 
F. Gentry said in urging congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the oil industry, however, said there are no immediate plans to 
take advantage of the Middle East crisis by seeking a reversal of Bush's 
10-year ban. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wilson, an official of the Western States Petroleum Assn., also said that 
it would take 10 to 15 years to develop new offshore drilling operations as a 
result of the confrontation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But he also said that there is a pressing need to increase domestic oil 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"This instance simply underlines the dangers of being dependent on foreign 
energy sources," Wilson said. "We would hope people could see that increasing 
our domestic petroleum sources would (keep the United States from becoming) 
involved in conflicts that we are seeing right now in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
But San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard pointed out that the amount of oil 
believed to be available off the Orange County coast equals only three days of 
the total U.S. consumption -- not enough to risk ruining the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly realize that foreign oil dependence is a problem" Haggard said. 
"But we do not see drilling off our shores as the answer to that problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council took the lead in the renewed lobbying effort when 
it voted this week to send Gentry and Mayor Lida Lenney to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"My gas (price) has gone up," Gentry said. "It says to me the oil industry has 
reacted and reacted quickly. They (oil companies) are not stupid. They are 
going to see this action as an opportunity to try to open up the California 
coast." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach is a member of the Orange County Coalition of Coastal Cities, 
which also includes Dana Point, Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, 
San Clemente and the county. The coalition has invited representatives from the 
business community and an inland city to testify before the House 
Appropriations Committee in support of the 10-year ban on new drilling leases. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said the action would be directed at the appropriations committee, which 
controls funding for the U.S. Interior Department, the federal agency that 
oversees offshore oil exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"The executive order by Bush sets the policy for the executive branch of the 
government, and it's strong and it's good," Newport Beach City Manager Robert 
Wynn said. "However, it is not binding in any way, shape or form." 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state officials said they had not seen any increased activity by 
oil companies to seek new offshore drilling permits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are all going to have to wait and see what happens in Iraq and 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia before we see what happens," said Susan Hansch, energy 
resources manager for the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It would definitely provide very important protection in new areas that never 
have been leased," Hansch said about the proposed legislation. She added that 
most of the leases are in the Santa Barbara area, with others located near 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
An Interior Department official in the Los Angeles regional office said that 
113 leases are still in effect off the California coast, compared to 135 a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry spokesman Wilson said 407 million barrels of oil are produced in 
California each year.

CYPRESS AT FEVER PITCH OVER LITTLE LEAGUE CHAMPIONS

<P>
Up to now, this city of neat housing tracts and well-groomed parks had only a 
race track and a spiffy new industrial park to boast about. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was something that big cities like Los Angeles to the north and its 
Orange County neighbor, Anaheim, cheered about. That is, until this week, when 
the Cypress All-Stars triumphed over a Michigan team during the Little League 
World Series in Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved Cypress into the U.S. finals of the 44th Little League World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, people don't even know where Cypress is," said Carol Wilkerson, the 
Little League incoming president. "But the team is going to put Cypress on the 
map. We're real excited." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress was to play the winner of the East and South semifinals today, but rain 
caused suspension of that game on Wednesday. The East-South game was 
rescheduled for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of this city of 45,700 wedged into 6.4 square miles were in such a 
frenzy this week to throw a big bash for their boys of summer, they momentarily 
forgot that in order to plan a downtown parade, you need to have a downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to have something, you know, like a lot of big towns with a 
professional sports team or a big college team have when they parade downtown. 
. . . but we don't have a downtown," said Councilman John Kanel. 
</P>
<P>
And so, instead, the city and Little League officials are planning an elaborate 
celebration for their young players -- win or lose -- on the steps of City 
Hall, Kanel said. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony is planned for Tuesday, because if the team wins, the local boys 
may travel to Washington on Monday for a White House visit with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Kanel, who helped found the Cypress Federal Little League in 1963, said the 
All-Star team is only the third Orange County team to make it to the Little 
League World Series in Williamsport, the home of Little League in the United 
States. In 1968, the Bolsa All-Stars from Santa Ana lost, 3-0, in the 
semifinals, and the Northwood All-Stars from Irvine made it to the finals in 
1987, only to be pounded 21-1 by a Taiwanese team. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson said the team's achievements have already generated town pride and an 
excitement unmatched in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tight-knit community. Everybody knows somebody on that team. We're 
really proud," said Judy Woiemberghe, who has lived with her husband and family 
in Cypress for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Marquees at the city Community Center and Cypress High School offer 
congratulatory praise, while some local stations in Los Angeles broadcast 
snippets of the team's 9-0 win over Brooklyn, Mich., on nightly newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been following them and I think it's neat because I have a boy," said 
Julie Novak, from La Palma, who was shopping at a store in Cypress. "If we had 
this happening to a team in La Palma, I think we would be going nuts!" 
</P>
<P>
Several fans urged Wilkerson to ask the local cable company to broadcast 
Tuesday's Cypress-Brooklyn game. But the cable company told her it would cost 
$1,320 for the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to go around and get pledges and sponsors to hear the game," Wilkerson 
said. "They couldn't show the game because they didn't own the rights so we 
could only listen to the audio portion. But we raised the $1,320 in six hours." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson's mother, Margaret, sat glued to the television set during the 
Cypress-Brooklyn game and heard the announcer describe the local team's 
back-to-back home runs by Eddie Zamora and Pat Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have heard it. It was grrrreat!" said the elder Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement is spreading even among non-Little League fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any professional sports and the only good team to watch was the 
basketball team at the local college," said Ronald Krieg, who sells and repairs 
vacuum cleaners in a Cypress shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never followed Little League before, but with all the news on Cypress now 
about the kids and their team, I'm going to start watching their games on TV," 
Krieg said. 
</P>
<P>
One fan at a Buena Park restaurant is especially proud, but anxious. Daniel 
Chlebowski, 25, owner of Northwood Pizza, was the sponsor of the Northwood 
All-Star team from Irvine that went to the World Series three years ago. And 
this year, he was the Cypress All-Star team's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"Jinx? Me? Oh no, don't even say that!" exclaimed Chlebowski, who plans to show 
today's game on two giant TV screens at his restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Chlebowski said he donated more money after the Cypress team won the regionals 
to help pay for out-of-pocket travel expenses, including meals. 
</P>
<P>
The Little League's national organization pays only for flight and hotel costs 
of the players and coaches. Wilkerson said 52 parents and 14 boys traveled to 
Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Little League excitement really started to take shape after June 17, 
when 14 boys were selected as all-star players to represent the Cypress Federal 
Little League. 
</P>
<P>
They won their district, which included Norwalk, Bellflower, and Buena Park. 
Then they swept through their sectional and divisional playoffs and won the 
Southern California Divisional Championship to reach the Western Regional 
Championship game held last week in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson said the team beat teams from Arizona, Utah, Hawaii and Idaho to take 
the regionals and win a chance to play in Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose today, one thing seems certain: The spunky team of predominantly 
12-year-olds will not soon be forgotten on the streets of Cypress.

TASK FORCE TO STUDY CAMPAIGN SIGN LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
With less than three months until the Nov. 6 election, the City Council this 
week decided against loosening restrictions on where candidates can place 
campaign signs. Instead, the council sent the politically charged issue back to 
the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to form a task force that will include council members Don 
Griffin and Donna L. Chessen and representatives of the city's legal staff to 
take another look at the issue. The committee is expected to make public its 
findings next month. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin objected to provisions allowing signs to be placed in city-owned 
parkways without adjacent property owners' consent. The loosened restrictions 
also would allow candidates to put up their placards more than 30 days prior to 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said that the changes would be a "disgrace" because signs would be 
going up all over the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant City Atty. Andrew Arczynsky told the council that the 
current restrictions are unconstitutional because political signs are the 
purest form of freedom of speech. Both political and non-political signs must 
be treated the same, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with political signs, the task force also will review proposed 
restrictions on real estate signs. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Buena Park/Cypress/La Palma Board of Realtors, who helped the 
Planning Commission draft the revisions, came to the meeting Monday to show 
their support of a proposed ordinance that would restrict the number of 
open-house signs that can be placed on a property while it is being sold. It 
also limits the number of hours and days that the signs can be put up. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is expected to make its recommendations at the Sept. 17 council 
meeting. LYNDA NATALI

TRUSTEES OK STIFFER DRUG,ALCOHOL CURBS

<P>
The Newport-Mesa Unified School District board has revised its drug and alcohol 
policy to provide that students caught under the influence of drugs or alcohol 
are automatically transferred to a new school after their first offense. 
</P>
<P>
The student-conduct policy, which administrators refer to as "nearly 
zero-tolerance," is designed to serve as more of a deterrent than a five-day 
suspension, which was the previous punishment, board member Jim de Boom said. 
</P>
<P>
Suspensions, which for some students meant a chance for a trip to amusement 
parks or malls, did not clearly convey the district's stance that use of these 
substances will not be tolerated, De Boom explained. 
</P>
<P>
The new wording will mean that the first time a student is found with an 
illegal substance, he or she will be transferred to one of the other high 
schools or grade schools in the district. A second offense will constitute 
grounds for expulsion. Any student caught selling or distributing drugs or 
alcohol will be automatically expelled. 
</P>
<P>
The policy calls for education and intervention efforts at the school to which 
a student is transferred, and can include counseling for the student and 
family. As expected, the board voted unanimously for the new wording. 
</P>
<P>
The school district staff is now preparing to notify parents and students about 
the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout board discussions over the last two months, one concern has been 
making sure that students are aware of the changes. Board member Rod McMillan 
said that he was comfortable with the "clear message" of the new policy but 
expected that "somebody might get burned" until everyone is aware of the 
severity of the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The policy is tough but fair, said board member Sherry Loofbourrow, adding that

CITY COUNCIL FORMS PARKS COMMISSION

<TEXT>
<P>
A commission has been formed to oversee city parks, recreation facilities and 
parkways. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council created the seven-member commission to reduce the number of 
park issues being brought to the council and to give them more intensive 
consideration, said Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis. 
</P>
<P>
Genis initiated the drive to form a parkways commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that it was a good idea in that we have a lot of issues relating to 
parkways and trees coming to us, and they are important, but they don't have a 
forum except for the City Council," Genis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our parks are important enough to have a committee looking at the issues and 
the facilities, and to make sure we have parks that meet the needs of our 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The commission will consider such issues as how the city uses open space, how 
it can incorporate water-saving plants in its landscape and whether to remove 
or retain parkway trees. 
</P>
<P>
Interested Costa Mesa residents may apply to the city for consideration. After 
final adoption of the commission at the council's next meeting Sept. 3, the 
city will review the applications and select the volunteer commission members. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will meet on the first Wednesday of each month and will have as 
much authority as the Planning Commission, which makes decisions that are final 
unless appealed to the City Council, Genis said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

BROWN'S SENTENCING SET BACK TO SEPT. 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sentencing of convicted murderer David Brown, who faces life in prison for 
orchestrating his wife's 1985 killing, was postponed Wednesday following a 
death in the family of one of the lawyers in the case. The court date was 
rescheduled for Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The delay gives the 37-year-old Brown additional time to work with a sentencing 
specialist whom he has apparently hired in an attempt to dissuade Judge Donald 
A. McCartin from sending him to prison for life without the possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really curious to hear what (the sentencing specialist) is going to say," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
In order to give Brown any lesser sentence -- such as life with the chance for 
parole -- McCartin would have to reject the jury's finding that Brown had his 
wife Linda killed in part for financial gain, according to prosecutors' reading 
of the law. 
</P>
<P>
The former computer businessman collected $835,000 on his wife's life insurance 
while his teen-aged daughter -- whom he persuaded to commit the murder -- sat 
in prison for nearly four years before implicating her father in the plot. 
Brown was convicted in June.

1,800-UNIT PROJECT OKD DESPITE PROTESTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pleas from Anaheim Hills residents who claimed that they had not been 
adequately notified about an 1,800-dwelling development in the rolling hills 
that Anaheim shares with the city of Orange, the Orange Planning Commission 
voted this week to approve the Serrano Heights project. 
</P>
<P>
The 727 acres previously zoned for agriculture will be designated for 
development of apartments, townhouses and single-family houses and will require 
massive grading of ridgelines between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 homeowners from East Orange and Anaheim Hills wore orange ribbons 
pinned to their shirts in opposition to the Woodcrest Development project. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Lewis of Anaheim Hills presented a petition bearing 681 signatures that 
outlined the concerns of residents and requested that construction be 
restricted to 100 feet below the existing ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
Other Anaheim residents who claimed that they had not been informed about the 
project clashed frequently with commissioners Carmine Master and Donald Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been going on for 6 years," Scott told the residents, "And I feel we 
have addressed all the issues. Additional input should have come in in 1988," 
when the development agreement was approved, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodcrest project was the best plan that the commission had considered for 
the site since an initial proposal was made for 3,200 units, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand there are going to be impacts," Master said. "There were impacts 
to build where your homes are now. We do find that the total project, including 
its assets, far overrides the liabilities." The project guarantees 476 acres of 
permanent open space, a 4-acre park, and the extension of Serrano Avenue, 
providing a four-lane throughway connecting Orange and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have protested the development, saying it will endanger wildlife, 
lower property values and destroy the semi-rural lifestyle that attracted them 
to the area in the first place. MARY HELEN BERG

REWARD OFFER BRINGS 'HOT TIPS' IN TRIPLE KILLING 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators in the execution-style murder of three auto parts store employees 
were pursuing "several promising leads" Wednesday that could lead to an arrest, 
a police spokesman said, and they have determined that $1,100 was stolen during 
the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Police Lt. Houston Williams, who is heading the probe into Monday's 
triple murder, said detectives have received several "hot tips" generated in 
part by a $50,000 reward offered by the victims' employer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have several people we are looking at," Williams said. "But we are not 
prepared to call them suspects (yet). . . . The last thing that I want to do is 
put anything out in the press and spook a suspect into running." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Super Shops store, located at Tustin Avenue and 1st Street, 
reopened for business Wednesday after police completed the long chore of 
sorting through computerized receipts. Initial investigations had found nothing 
missing in the store, but a manager later pointed investigators to a 
compartment of the safe that had been overlooked. The day's cash receipts were 
kept in that part of the safe. 
</P>
<P>
Company President Gregg Koechlein said investigators completed their audit at 3 
a.m. Wednesday and discovered a loss of about $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive for the slayings now appears to be a cover-up for robbery," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
A manager of the store, which opened three months ago, arrived at work about 9 
a.m. Monday and discovered the bodies of Darrell Esgar, 22, of Huntington 
Beach, Chad Chadwick, 22, of Orange, and Russel B. Williams, 21, of Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Each had been shot in the head at close range, police said. One of the victims 
had his hands and feet bound, another had his hands bound and the third had 
only his feet bound. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the three victims appear to have been shot about 6 p.m. 
Sunday. Williams said investigators are trying to determine who was at the 
store Sunday and at what time they left. 
</P>
<P>
Police also said they have determined the caliber of weapon used in the 
slayings, but declined to provide other details. 
</P>
<P>
Super Shops President Koechlein said the $50,000 reward offered by the company 
has prompted many of the tips that police are following. 
</P>
<P>
"From what (police) told me, the response has been really overwhelming," he 
said. "It's gratifying to see that."

PEOPLE: LIGHTING UP THE SKY JUST SIDELINE FOR HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert A. Metter is a free-lance fireworks specialist with a positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a positive attitude you don't have many setbacks, including 
injuries," said the Pacific Bell Telephone Co. worker in Anaheim who finds 
great joy in lighting the sky with rainbow-colored spectaculars. 
</P>
<P>
Setting off fireworks gives him a shot of adrenalin. 
</P>
<P>
"You get people's attention from all over because they can see the show for 
miles," said the one-time boat decorator and Vietnam Army veteran. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Metter often sees his handiwork while driving home to Diamond Bar 
after the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell myself 'I put that cloud up there,' " he said. "It's a real charge to 
have thousands of people out there and hear them cheer when you shoot fireworks 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
He put on the show at Anaheim Stadium for the Fourth of July, a continuation of 
the sparkling sideline he started in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got interested in it after watching a fireworks show at Disneyland," he 
said, pointing out that a good attitude is a prime requisite in safely shooting 
fireworks at outdoor public shows. 
</P>
<P>
Metter, 43, said many fireworks are shot from mortars. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to feel good about yourself and what you're doing, otherwise you can 
run into big trouble with the fireworks," he said. "Shooting from mortars is 
like firing a cannon." 
</P>
<P>
Metter, one of about 500 licensed fireworks shooters in Southern California, 
follows a specific list of rules that includes "staying away from the mortars 
when they are loaded. That makes them like loaded little cannons." 
</P>
<P>
One way to protect himself and others is his contingent of helpers, which 
includes his brother, sister and friends. 
</P>
<P>
He had 15 helpers for the Anaheim Stadium show and most of them are working for 
their own fireworks licenses, which take two years of apprenticeship to 
acquire. 
</P>
<P>
He has known most of them since he was 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Shooting fireworks is less dangerous than staying home and baking pies," said 
Metter, a night student at Cal Poly Pomona studying for a business degree. 
"It's what you choose to do. Everything has an element of risk." 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena City College graduate said that in his early days he wanted to be 
rich and famous, "but I didn't end up getting either of them." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, "Fireworks is my little fame and fortune and I feel real 
proud about it." 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year phone company veteran figures he has choreographed 170 fireworks 
shows throughout Southern California since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Most are finales of such shows as high school graduations, football homecoming 
games, dedications of shopping centers, commercials for television and Fourth 
of July celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
He also shot fireworks for the last Olympic Games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After earning his business degree, Metter plans to get into some phase of the 
electronics world. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't quite figured that out yet," he said. But "whatever turns up, I'll 
still be shooting fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
A year and a half ago, Todd Harwood, 27, joined the Garden Grove Elks Lodge and 
immediately became deeply involved in its clown program, which entertains kids 
and senior citizens, and performs at charity events. 
</P>
<P>
So much, in fact, that the restaurant manager and Midway City resident decided 
to get married on the Elks float during the recent St. Patrick's Day parade in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
His fiancee, Marilyn Laizure, 29, wasn't all that thrilled with the idea, "but 
after we discussed the plan, she got caught up in it too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood noted, however, that while she vetoed the idea of getting married in 
clown costumes, everyone else on the float wore one. 
</P>
<P>
But it appears that those who clown together have a good chance of staying 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she wears a costume and goes with me on some of my clown assignments," he 
said.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SOPHOMORE SEASON MIGHT BE THE LAST FOR TENNESSEE'S CHUCK 
WEBB, WHO PREFERS FIELD TO CLASSROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
This is one Volunteer who would rather get paid. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Webb is a college football player who likes football, but could do 
without college. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't lie to you and say I like going to college and going to school," 
the sophomore running back told reporters as Tennessee opened practice this 
month. "I don't wake up with a smile on my face, saying, 'I get to go to 
English class.' " 
</P>
<P>
Webb ran for 1,236 yards last year as a redshirt freshman at Tennessee, with 
296 of those coming against Mississippi, breaking the school record set in 1983 
by Johnnie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
It was enough to start people talking Heisman, though no one from Tennessee had 
finished in the top five in Heisman Trophy voting since the current coach, 
Johnny Majors, came in second in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
But if Webb is to win the Heisman, he might have to become the first sophomore 
to do so. Two years could be as long as his college career lasts. 
</P>
<P>
Now that restrictions on underclassmen entering the NFL draft have been eased, 
more and more are likely to make the move early. 
</P>
<P>
As Tennessee prepares to play Colorado on Sunday in the first Disneyland 
Pigskin Classic at Anaheim Stadium, Webb is calling the chances "probably 80%" 
that his sophomore season will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have a good year, I'll probably think about it," Webb said this week. "It 
might be an 80% chance I will go. It depends on how the team does, also, and 
whether we have a chance to win the national title." 
</P>
<P>
Webb and college have not been an easy mix. 
</P>
<P>
During his redshirt year, he was arrested for forging a teammate's signature on 
a scholarship check, and was ordered to make restitution and perform community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after a spectacular season in which he took over for starter Reggie 
Cobb after Cobb was suspended midseason because of a failed drug test, Webb ran 
into more trouble at school. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of cheating in a class, and though Webb denies any wrongdoing, 
he was suspended from school. That forced him to make up 20 hours in order to 
regain his eligibility for this season. He earned six hours through 
correspondance courses during his suspension, then returned to Knoxville and 
earned six more in a summer school mini-term and another eight during regular 
summer school. 
</P>
<P>
The experiences -- and the attention from the media and the public -- have left 
Webb a guarded man. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to assume anyway, when they read Chuck Webb allegedly was 
caught cheating, that it's true," Webb said. "People remember things that are 
bad, not good about you. They remember when you lose a game more than when you 
win a game." 
</P>
<P>
Webb said the cheating accusation was the result of similar research. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get the same information from the library, how can you say that is 
cheating?" 
</P>
<P>
In his occasional interviews, Webb maintains a stoic attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing people wrote or said on TV really bothered me," he said. "They really 
didn't know me." 
</P>
<P>
Now people get to know him mostly through his exploits on the field. 
</P>
<P>
As a high school player in Toledo, Ohio, Webb averaged 10.7 yards a carry, a 
statistic that would lead you to believe you could hand him the ball and 
collect your first down. Give it to him eight times from the 20 and kick your 
extra point. 
</P>
<P>
He showed that kind of talent at Tennessee last year, averaging 5.9 yards a 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Chuck Webb has the talent to be as fine a running back as the country 
has," Majors said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Mississippi, Webb had a quarter most running backs would have been 
proud to have for a game. Tennessee entered the fourth quarter trailing, 21-20. 
As the final 15 minutes ticked off, Webb ran for 142 yards and the go-ahead 
touchdown. Tennessee won, 33-21. 
</P>
<P>
"They just started giving him the ball, and he started hammering on us," 
Mississippi Coach Billy Brewer said. "We couldn't take the ball away from 'em. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck Webb is a heckuva football player. He's durable, he's a powerful runner 
inside, he's got great balance, great vision and excellent speed. When they get 
in trouble, they start giving the ball to Chuck Webb." 
</P>
<P>
For as long, that is, as Chuck Webb is there.

SLATER BLINKS, REPORTS TO RAMS

<P>
When it comes to playing football, the Rams are pretty good. When it comes to 
playing hardball, nobody does it better. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle Jackie Slater ended his 28-day holdout Wednesday and reported 
to Rams Park. The six-time Pro Bowl selection didn't get his contract 
re-negotiated, however. He obviously didn't get the trade he demanded three 
weeks ago, either. And he apparently didn't get the Rams to waive the fines 
levied against him, which could total $42,000 if he was being fined the NFL 
maximum of $1,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, 36, a 14-year veteran who will earn a reported $550,000 this year, was 
seeking a deal that would put him on a level with the league's highest-paid 
offensive linemen. (Cincinnati's Anthony Munoz, for example, earns $875,000 a 
year). 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Slater apparently got a verbal guarantee that he would be more fairly 
compensated in 1991, when he will set a club record for longevity, breaking the 
mark of 15 seasons established by Charlie Cowan, Joe Scibelli and Merlin Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the opportunity to sit down with the organization and we mutually agreed 
on some things that addressed the problem that I was having, so here I am," 
Slater said. When asked direct questions about his contract and the fines, he 
would only say, "it's Rams' policy not to re-negotiate contracts" and "it's 
Rams policy not to waive fines." 
</P>
<P>
That much, of course, he knew before he decided to hold out. So why did he 
return? 
</P>
<P>
"We had a meeting of the minds and everyone concerned feels that my goals are 
realistic and I should be given the opportunity to obtain them," Slater said. 
"We agreed on the fact that I will be playing here next year. All the details 
haven't been ironed out, but I'll be here and I'm very pleased with the way the 
Rams ended up handling my situation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Slater said he was "certainly serious" when he requested that the Rams 
trade him. "My feeling was that I was able to play two more years, regardless 
of where it was," he said. "When I felt I wasn't going to be here, I looked at 
it as an opportunity to see what was inside me, to go to a different system at 
my age, be impressive enough to make the club and then start in a different 
offense. It was a challenging thought, to say the least, and something that I 
was certainly going to get up for." 
</P>
<P>
During the early days of the holdout, Coach John Robinson lashed out at Slater, 
pointing out that Slater was under contract and ought to think about his 
obligations to the team. But Slater said he has no ill will toward the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any hard feelings about what was said in the past," he said. "All 
of that was in the past. Hopefully, this will all be put to rest now and we can 
concentrate on trying to accomplish some of the team goals that we have." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, not surprisingly, was 100% behind that line of reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I irritated and frustrated him," Robinson said. "But I was frustrated 
at the time, too. Relationships between human beings have frustration involved. 
Unfortunately, (our relationships) undergo the scrutiny of the press. Those are 
things you just have to get by. 
</P>
<P>
"And despite those statements I made, my respect for Jackie is as much as for 
any athlete I've ever known." 
</P>
<P>
Slater, who has been running and working out on his own during the holdout, 
said he planned on playing in Saturday night's exhibition game against Phoenix. 
</P>

"Football shape and just what I've been doing are a lot different, though," he 
said. "The next couple of days will tell the story to me about how much I can 
play (Saturday). But I've got two solid weeks of work before the season opener, 
so I'll be ready by then." 
</P>
<P>
While admitting he was angry and frustrated at times during the past month, 
Slater said he never gave up hope of reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always dialogue and there was never a closed ear, on my part or 
theirs," Slater said. "Fortunately, there was always a thread of hope, despite 
the gloomy circumstances that existed at one time. That thread turned into a 
couple of strands and from there into a rope."

Coach John Robinson said he would alternate Gaston Green and Curt Warner at 
running back during Saturday's exhibition game against Phoenix, with the 
intention of getting more work for Warner. "He needs now to get enough carries 
to feel his progress," Robinson said. "To me, he's making really good progress. 
It's like a guy in spring training who's swinging the bat real well but hitting 
.210. Curt's doing very well, but he's been overshadowed by Green." Green has 
gained 186 yards in 35 carries during the exhibition season. Warner has only 32 
yards in 14 carries. . . . Running back Cleveland Gary's back continues to 
cause problems and Robinson said he may or may not play Saturday. "He goes and 
then all of a sudden the muscle starts cramping up and he can't go anymore," 
Robinson said. "Hopefully, it's getting better, but I'm certainly not going to 
play him unless I feel he's past it."

Linebacker Mel Owens, who has been experiencing continued back pain, underwent 
a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test Wednesday and Dr. William Dillin diagnosed 
the problem as disc inflammation. Owens will be out indefinitely. . . . Results 
of an arthrogram performed on the left wrist of defensive tackle Mike Piel were 
negative and the injury was diagnosed as a sprain. Piel, who also has a sore 
left elbow, is questionable for Saturday night's game.

Rookie running back Anthony Thompson, the last of the Phoenix Cardinals' 
training camp holdouts, agreed to contract terms Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a second-round draft pick from Indiana and the 1989 Heisman Trophy 
runner-up, was expected to arrive here sometime today. He has missed 30 days of 
camp so far. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Coach Joe Bugel said Thompson could possibly play in Saturday night's 
exhibition game against the Rams at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe. It's catch-up time for him," Bugel said. "The good thing about Anthony 
is that he's a magnificently conditioned kid. He's probably in better condition 
than any rookie around." 
</P>
<P>
But another rookie, running back Johnny Johnson, a seventh-round pick from San 
Jose State, is Phoenix's starter and has a team-leading 121 yards in 23 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been the most pleasant surprise of training camp," Bugel said of Johnson. 
"He's doing a good job of running inside and outside. He's the one guy on 
offense who's done a super job." 
</P>
<P>
As a junior in 1988, he was one of three Spartan football players to compete 
for the basketball team after a midseason player defection. Johnson started the 
last 12 games, averaging 11.2 points and 6.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want Johnny Johnson out of the lineup right now," Bugel said. "We know 
he can play every down. We need to see what Anthony Thompson can do. He needs 
some repetitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want him to come in here and work himself into good physical and mental 
condition and we'll take it from there. There's no challenge between Anthony 
and Johnny Johnson right now. This will just give us two excellent running 
backs." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 207-pound Thompson set a school career record with 5,299 rushing 
yards at Indiana. It's the second-highest total in Big Ten history behind the 
5,589 yards of former Ohio State great Archie Griffin, a two-time Heisman 
Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and his two representatives -- agent Marvin Demoff and family adviser 
Dr. Dan Grossman -- reportedly met with Cardinals' chief negotiator Bob Wallace 
in Las Vegas, an agreed-upon neutral site, to work out a contract Tuesday 
night. The deal was struck Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix was offering Thompson a two-year, $1.1 million contract with Thompson 
seeking a two-year, $1.32 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
Financial figures of what Thompson agreed to were not disclosed, in keeping 
with team policy. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson flew to his home in Bloomington, Ind., to collect some belongings 
Wednesday afternoon before heading for Phoenix and was not available for 
comment.

U.S. YACHT RACING JUNIOR SAILING CHAMPIONSHIP;

TWIST WINS ONE RACE TO KEEP LEAD

Jory Twist of the host Newport Harbor Yacht Club held on to first place in the 
four-person Etchells 22 class Wednesday despite a seventh-place finish in the 
first of two races at the U.S. Yacht Racing Union/Rolex Junior Sailing 
Championships off Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Brisk afternoon winds enabled Twist, Orange County's only entry, to win the 
second race, giving him three first-place finishes in the first six races of 
the Sears Trophy competition. He holds a 2 1/4-point lead over second-place 
Scott Elting of Houston Yacht Club and a 3 1/2-point lead over Meg Gaillard of 
American Yacht Club in Rye, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Gaillard, whose consistent sailing in the past five races has advanced her from 
last to third place, is one of two female skippers in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
In the Flying Junior class, Bill Hardesty of Mission Bay Yacht Club in San 
Diego retained the lead by finishing 5 1/2 points ahead of Jesse Andrews of 
American Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
In the Laser class, David Houser of Mission Bay Yacht Club regained first place 
overall from Mike Hare of Houston Yacht Club by 1 1/2 points. But the top 
sailor of the day was Brett Davis of St. Petersburg Yacht Club in Florida, who 
finished first in both of Wednesday's races. 
</P>
<P>
Houser said he regained the lead because "I was finally consistent." 
</P>
<P>
A protest is pending in the Laser class, but it will not affect Wednesday's 
leaders. William Warren of Toms River Yacht Club in New Jersey and Jonathan 
Tueting of Winnetka (Ill.) Yacht Club, who were at the back of the fleet after 
five races, are the skippers involved. 
</P>
<P>
The start of Wednesday's competition was delayed when a last-minute wind shift 
forced officials to reset the course. Winds varied from 8 to 10 knots in the 
morning and 10 to 15 knots in the afternoon. The sea was flat until an 
afternoon breeze produced a one- to two-foot chop. A two-knot current favored 
boats on windward tacks. 
</P>
<P>
Races continue through Friday, when the winners will be determined based upon a 
round-robin, low-point scoring system. Winners will become part of the 1990 
U.S. Junior sailing team.

FEAR OF LONG LINES SEEN AS DETERRENT TO WOULD-BE VISITORS AT NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Has the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace fallen victim to its own publicity 
wave? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question Kevin Cartwright asks when people say they haven't visited 
yet because they don't want to have to wait in line. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright, the library's spokesman, said the facility has had an average of 
1,000 visitors a day since opening to the public July 20. At that pace, the 
library's annual attendance would fall short of the 500,000-visitor-a-year 
estimate projected when ground was broken two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright said he tells people that there are few waits at the library and 
that the building can handle large groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said some people may have the impression there are long waits at the library 
because of the hoopla during its opening, which was attended by President Bush 
and former Presidents Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The library has 
attracted worldwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors have ranged from Southern Californians to out-of-state tourists to 
foreign visitors, especially from Japan. Cartwright said that 35 Japanese news 
agencies covered the opening ceremonies, giving the library wide exposure in 
the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright said the library should appeal to budget-conscious tourists. At 
$3.95 for adults, $2 for senior citizens and free admission for children under 
11, the price of admission is much lower than that of Disneyland or Knott's 
Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the library has managed to attract crowds without a word of paid 
advertising. But Cartwright said that may change. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we would have to have some sort of other ad campaign," he said.

HOME RESALES: SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE AND OWNER MAY OFFER YOU THE MOON.

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Gallas' home has been on the market for more than 6 months now with nary 
a nibble. 
</P>
<P>
The self-employed financial consultant says two stints with different real 
estate agents failed to generate much interest in the house -- a situation he 
blames in large part on his mailing address. 
</P>
<P>
The home is in a well-kept area of North Tustin, but that isn't part of any 
city so the post office has decreed that the legal address is Santa Ana, whose 
urban, polyglot image makes it a tougher sale. 
</P>
<P>
"If this place was on the other side of Newport Boulevard (in Tustin), it would 
sell in a minute," said Gallas, who believes that the glutted market makes it 
even harder to get agents to work to move hard-to-sell properties. 
</P>
<P>
So Gallas has decided to try his own marketing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The gimmick: Each week, for an unspecified period of time, Gallas will slash 
$5,000 from the $434,900 asking price -- already down from an initial $465,000 
-- for the five-bedroom, four-bath, 3,300-square-foot home, located in a 
30-year-old neighborhood right out of "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
He said he's not afraid the tactic will simply drive the price down. "People 
will hear about it and come look out of curiosity, but someone will fall in 
love with the place and make an offer because they won't want to chance losing 
it to someone else by waiting for another week or two," he figures. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, at $5,000 a week, it will take 2 months just to effect a 10% reduction 
in Gallas' current asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell whether his strategy works. But one thing already is clear: He 
is just one of a growing number of frustrated homeowners who have been forced 
to become marketing mavens as the pace of resale activity in once-hot Orange 
County slows. 
</P>
<P>
This means that many homes that 2 years ago stayed on the market for just a few 
days, now take a month or more to sell. And some high-priced homes linger a lot 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the East Orange County Board of Realtors, 
the average single family home in the $200,000 to $249,000 price range that 
sold in July was on the market for 70 days -- up from 35 days in July, 1988. 
The average detached home in the $300,000 to $399,999 range was on the market 
111 days before selling in July -- contrasted with 58 days market time 2 years 
ago and only 53 days last year. 
</P>
<P>
And the economic and political uncertainty now sweeping the nation means the 
market probably will get even slower before there is any chance of improvement, 
veteran real estate agents say. 
</P>
<P>
One tactic that seems to be gaining in popularity -- especially at the higher 
end of the market where sellers have a lot of equity to make deals with -- is 
offering a bonus to the real estate agent who brings in a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Hana Simon, an agent with Century 21 Professionals in Irvine, said she has one 
client who is offering a 4% commission plus $5,000 to any agent who brings in a 
buyer. That's in addition to the 3% commission Simon receives as the seller's 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said incentives paid directly to agents "are popping up because there are 
so many homes on the market that sellers feel they have to do something to make 
their home stand out" to brokers and sales people. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Slater of Orange Realty Associates in Orange said there is an overabundance 
of listings -- area realty boards estimate there are about 20,000 homes on the 
resale market in Orange County today. Buyers are in short supply and 
imagination is needed to make a sale. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the plan of attack when a home hasn't moved in a decent interval 
is for the seller to lower the price or offer to help potential buyers with 
down payments -- often hard for people to scrape together at today's prices -- 
by carrying back a small second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, a seller gets more colorful and offers a free trip to Hawaii or a 
cruise along the Mexican Riviera, said Larry Marsters, owner of the Help U Sell 
realty franchises for Orange, Villa Park and Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"But mainly, we see people coming in and offering to pay the buyer's 
non-recurring costs, like escrow and title fees, or saying they'll pay the 
points. Things like that make it a little easier for buyers." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because Help U Sell clients do a lot of the marketing and sales 
work themselves, the company charges a reduced rate, generally considerably 
lower than the standard 6% commission. The fees vary depending on locale and 
price, but Marsters said his office would charge $5,990 for assisting in the 
sale of a $300,000 home -- about $12,000 less than the full service brokerage 
fee of $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
"So a lot of times, people will come to us after their house has been on the 
market for a while, and they'll reduce the price by the difference between the 
full commission and our fee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Miller, a retired Rockwell Corp. manager, said he found one more way to 
move a property. 
</P>
<P>
He's been trying through a real estate agent to sell a $279,000, four-bedroom 
home in Dana Point for 3 months and didn't have one inquiry. When Miller's 
contract with the agent expired, he began advertising the house himself, 
offering it for sale, for lease or for lease with an option to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"The lease and lease-option were the magic ingredients," he said. "I got 35 or 
40 calls in 2 weeks and recently leased it to a couple who took an option to 
buy. And the option even had a built-in inflation factor so I won't get hurt if 
the market takes off again." 
</P>
<P>
A seller has to abandon the idea that the only way to dispose of a property and 
get money out of it is to sell outright, Miller said. But once that hurdle is 
passed, "leasing or selling gives both you and the buyer a lot of room to 
maneuver. And you can take a signed lease to the bank and borrow on the 
property." 
</P>

TODAY'S HOUSING MARKET: A TOUGH SELL 
</P>
<P>
After two years of double-digit price increases, the housing market in Orange 
County has slowed dramatically, and homes in many areas are waiting longer to 
find buyers in comparison to the selling frenzy of two years ago. The figures 
below show the number of days homes in various areas of the county were on the 
market before selling:

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: 2 LIVE CREW RESCHEDULES O.C. SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
The rap group 2 Live Crew, which canceled an appearance at the Celebrity 
Theatre last month in the midst of national controversy over the group's 
allegedly obscene recordings, has announced it will play the theater after all, 
on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Already there are small swarms of community protest as some residents are again 
urging the city to ban the show. 
</P>
<P>
Members of an Anaheim group calling itself the American Civil Responsibilities 
Union asked the City Council on Aug. 14 to ban the rappers. 
</P>
<P>
"Reasonable community standards are to be expected," said Howard Garber, a 
member of the protest group. "Conservative Orange County is not going to put up 
with this apathy and indifference by the Anaheim City Council." 
</P>
<P>
The protest group had urged the council to ban 2 Live Crew last month, but 
before the council took action, the rappers cut short their California tour, 
explaining that leader Luther Campbell's doctor had ordered him to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Before the cancellation, the council had taken a low-key approach, hoping that 
with low ticket sales and little publicity the concert would fade away. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other ways to do it without running around screaming," Mayor Fred 
Hunter said. "For us to even pass a resolution banning the 2 Live Crew isn't 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a 2 Live Crew album called "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" was 
ruled obscene by a federal judge in Florida. However, the rappers have not been 
found to violate California obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
Garber said that if the Celebrity show takes place, his group will protest 
outside the theater. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Celebrity box office, about 900 of 2,500 tickets to the 
concert scheduled for last month had been sold and will be honored in November. 
</P>
<P>
Unmarried teen-agers are having more babies than ever, according to a recent 
report by the Department of Health and Human Services. Teen-agers 15 to 17 had 
33.8 births per 1,000 girls in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
One of every four births in the United States in 1988 was to an unwed mother, 
the federal government said. Although black women have the highest rate of 
children born out of wedlock, the rate has been rising fastest among white 
women.

<P>
Thoughts of kings and queens filled the heads of Orange County youths last 
weekend, though they weren't the kinds of which fairy tales are made. 
</P>
<P>
These particular 43 teens and pre-teens spent three days playing at the second 
annual National Chess Camp last Friday through Sunday at the Boys Club of 
Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very highly concentrated training program," said Robert Snyder, 36, 
founder and director of the camp. "Kids come out being much better players." 
</P>
<P>
Co-sponsored by the Boys Club of Placentia and the Chess for Juniors 
organization, the camp offered matches and workshops for beginning and advanced 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what we do here is provide a nationally rated tournament so the 
kids can get a national rating," said Snyder of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
To allow competitors to receive a national rating by the U.S. Chess Federation, 
the governing body of chess in the country, the tournaments must be run by a 
certified tournament instructor. In addition to Snyder, the other certified 
instructors and camp teachers were John Goetze, a fifth-grade teacher from Pear 
Blossom, Calif., and Cal Olson, a USCF-rated chess expert who owns a glass 
company in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder began playing chess as a child and attained an "expert" rating at 17 and 
a "master" rating shortly thereafter. Becoming a "master" player puts one in 
the top 1% of chess players in the United States, based on the rating system 
established by the chess federation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Snyder began teaching chess privately and in small groups. As he saw 
the interest in the game grow among youths, and as their parents learned more 
about the benefits of the game, Snyder founded the Chess for Juniors club in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Chess for Juniors in Garden Grove provides an environment for youngsters to 
learn to play or improve their game. For $30 per month, the 120 club members 
participate in weekend activities, receive instruction in the game and have 
access to books, videotapes and computers. 
</P>
<P>
Along with providing a social environment, Snyder said that playing chess 
"improves logic, concentration and abstract-thinking skills." 
</P>
<P>
He believes chess to be an excellent outlet for underachievers because the game 
is so mentally stimulating. "Sometimes kids with a low self-esteem can really 
get their confidence boosted by learning and playing well." 
</P>
<P>
As for overachievers, Snyder said, "they find the game endlessly challenging." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of running lessons and activities for members of Chess for Juniors, 
Snyder also offers a free chess class for beginners in hopes of sparking an 
interest in the game. He has also presented assemblies at elementary schools, 
where Snyder said he has reached more than 50,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, who has written a book on teaching chess to children, also has been 
invited to bring five of his club's best players to Leningrad, where they will 
play chess and then tour the Soviet Union. have asked rohwer for a date -- lip 
</P>
<P>
Though chess has many merits, many of last weekend's campers said they most 
enjoyed the thought process that goes with the game. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-grader Mark Henderson said he likes to use his brain and that is the best 
part of playing chess. 
</P>
<P>
"You use your mind in chess and that can be transferred to other things," said 
Henderson, an 11-year-old from Irvine. "It helps me improve my grades because 
my concentration is better." 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Behen, a seventh-grader from Little Rock, Calif., finished as a 
co-champion of the camp's recent tournament with a 5-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the difficulty. I love to think, so chess challenges me," Behen said. 
"I'm learning (in camp) to take my time a lot more, and I'm learning to look at 
every possibility for every move I make, not just set my mind on one move." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Swanek, a 17-year-old Tustin High School senior, has participated two 
consecutive years in chess camp. He said it is the difficulty and challenge of 
the game that keeps him intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
But the part Swanek enjoys the most? "I like the winning part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Swanek, who also finished 5-0 in the camp's tournament, has been playing chess 
since he was 6, when he was taught by his father. Last year, he finished first 
in the Chess for Juniors scholastic tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my improvement comes from chess lessons and from playing every day 
after school," said Swanek, adding that camp has taught him more about opening 
and closing strategies as well as how to deal with middle-game problems. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a member of Chess for Juniors for four years and says he plays the 
game almost every day during the school year and nearly as often in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do with it after I graduate," he says of his 
future in chess. However, he did say he wouldn't be headed in the direction of 
an expert or master because "those people eat and breathe chess."

SUMMER SUN GENERATES ADDED HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For many people summer is the time for swimming, sailing, picnics and outdoor 
recreation. However, summer heat and sun can be treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
Older people should be wary of food poisoning and heat strokes, two potentially 
fatal illnesses associated with summer. 
</P>
<P>
These days, most people do not give much thought to food poisoning. Modern 
methods to preserve food and retard bacteria should make the food we eat safe. 
Bacteria such as salmonella, botulism, staphylococcus and campylobacter are 
presumed to be fears of a former generation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most people would be surprised to learn that about 2 million cases of 
food poisoning occur each year in this country due to improper handling of food 
in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Food poisoning can become epidemic at picnics or other events where food is 
left unrefrigerated for a long time, when power outages cause refrigerators to 
shut down and from canning procedures that fail to kill bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
Diminished taste and smell also may be significant in determining if food is 
spoiled. Older people who live on a fixed income may be wary of throwing food 
away. And, in order to hold utility bills down, refrigerators often are kept 
above the recommended 40 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The following precautions can eliminate most sources of bacteria and prevent 
food poisoning: 
</P>
<P>
* Refrigerate food at 40 degrees; freeze it at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
* Freeze raw meat and poultry that will not be used within two days. 
</P>
<P>
* To thaw food, place it in the refrigerator, not on the counter, where 
bacteria can grow quickly. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure food and utensils are clean. 
</P>
<P>
* Wash hands with soap and water before preparing food. 
</P>
<P>
* Cook food thoroughly, including food prepared in a microwave. Avoid recipes 
that call for raw eggs or raw fish. 
</P>
<P>
* Freeze or refrigerate leftovers promptly. 
</P>
<P>
* Never leave a perishable food out of the refrigerator for more than two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of food poisoning include diarrhea, abdominal pain and nausea. 
Sometimes it is accompanied by fever and general discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has established a toll-free number to 
respond to consumer questions about safe handling of meat and poultry. Call 
(800) 535-4555 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays for information on proper food 
handling. 
</P>
<P>
Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are other potentially dangerous conditions 
associated with hot weather. Many people become needlessly ill each year 
because they do not take simple, preventive steps. 
</P>
<P>
Heat exhaustion is a warning that the body is getting too hot. Symptoms include 
thirst, giddiness, weakness, nausea and profuse sweating. If not attended to, 
heat exhaustion can develop into a more serious condition known as heat stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Some medications such as diuretics, sedatives and tranquilizers, and certain 
heart and blood pressure drugs, may affect the way an individual copes with 
heat. Don't discontinue medication, but discuss potential problems with a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Diseases that require special diets also may make a person more vulnerable to 
heat stroke. People with high blood pressure, for example, generally reduce the 
amount of salt in their diet, making temperature regulation more difficult. 
However, a person should not take salt tablets without consent of a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid heat exhaustion and heat stroke by following some simple steps: 
</P>
<P>
* Drink plenty of water and juices. 
</P>
<P>
* Wear light-weight, light-colored and loose-fitting clothing. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid activity during the hottest part of the day. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep meals simple and light. Keep oven use to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
* Use air-conditioners liberally or, if none is available, plan trips to cool 
places such as shopping malls, theaters and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone suspected of suffering heat stroke should receive immediate attention. 
Victims of heat stroke have a body temperature of 104 degrees or higher. The 
pulse may be rapid. 
</P>
<P>
Other symptoms may include flushed skin, a faint feeling, confused and bizarre 
behavior and combativeness. If symptoms are mild, get into a cool place, drink 
non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated fluids, and sponge off with cool water or take a 
cool bath or shower. 
</P>
<P>
If symptoms are severe, get emergency medical assistance immediately.

HUSSEIN MEETS FOREIGNERS AS CAMERAS ROLL

The Persian Gulf crisis hit home across the world today, with stark television 
footage of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein meeting with a clearly uneasy group 
of trapped foreigners, including Western children. 
</P>
<P>
"As Iraqis, Arabs and human beings, we want you to be safe," Hussein told about 
two dozen men, women and children, many of them English-speaking and believed 
to be British. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, wearing a gray suit and silk tie and speaking through an interpreter, 
told the Westerners in a quiet, level voice: "You are not hostages." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear when the film of the meeting was shot. The film 
was shown on Cable News Network. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to be an intimate meeting in a small room, with the hostages gathered 
on chairs and sofas and a television on in the background. Hussein sat on a 
simple dining chair as two officers in green uniforms stood behind him. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared to be the first time Hussein had been shown on television since 
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to get to know you in other circumstances," Hussein said. 
"We hope that your presence here is not going to be long." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leader said he was holding Westerners to prevent war but said he did 
not intend to use Westerners as shields against military attacks. He said the 
Arabic word for prevention had been misinterpreted by foreign journalists as 
the word for shield. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, addressing a boy about 10 years old, ruffled his hair and said, "So 
when he, along with his friends and all those present here, have played their 
role in preventing war, then you will all be heroes of peace." 
</P>
<P>
The boy tried to pull away several times. 
</P>
<P>
The hostages looked glum, but small children rolled on the floor in play, 
oblivious to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the camera panned to a teen-age boy with tears in his eyes, then 
quickly turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by armed guards, Hussein told the hostages they were free to ask him 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the adults, who spoke with British and Irish accents, asked if it 
were possible to send their children from the country or to get messages to 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein was noncommittal in his replies and took the opportunity to harangue 
the United States and other Western powers.

STANDOFF OVER EMBASSY; 
</P>
<P>
U.S., IRAQ WAGE A WAR OF WORDS

<P>
The United States and Iraq were on a collision course today over Baghdad's bid 
to close embassies in occupied Kuwait. Iraq said that defying the order would 
be an "act of aggression" but Washington warned that enforcing it would be a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
One report quoted Iraqi sources as saying embassies that failed to close by 
Friday as ordered would be surrounded by troops. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
said that would be a "mistake" on the Iraqis' part. 
</P>
<P>
A senior administration official said today that Marines assigned to the U.S. 
Embassy in Kuwait have pulled out, leaving behind the ambassador and a small 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to put American lives at unnecessary danger," he told a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
As to why the Marines did not stay to protect the consulate, he said, "A few 
Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi army." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the ambassador and the remaining staff of about a dozen would do if 
the Iraqi military tried to close down the facility by force, the official said 
he would not speculate. 
</P>
<P>
"By law, they have a right to be there," this official said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of foreigners, including about 3,000 Americans, are trapped in Iraq 
and Kuwait, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said they will serve as 
human shields against attack. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that strategy was being carried out. Polish workers arriving home 
from Iraq told the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza today that last week, as 
they left the Iraqi chemical factory where they had been working, about three 
dozen Americans arrived under guard. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, in what Iraqi media billed as an open letter to President Hosni 
Mubarak of Egypt, today denounced Egypt for sending troops to join U.S. and 
other forces in the defense of Saudi Arabia and said Arab leaders who failed to 
support Arab causes did not deserve to rule. His statement was read by an 
announcer on Iraqi television. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's information minister warned foreign governments not to try to keep their 
missions open. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News, citing Iraqi sources in Baghdad, said troops would surround each 
diplomatic mission in Kuwait that remained open after the deadline. The 
unidentified sources said the troops may prevent food from going into the 
buildings, which would be "put under virtual siege." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said today the United States and others have made it clear they would 
deem a shutdown of the embassies "an illegal act." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't recognize the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait, and I think most of us are 
determined to keep our embassies open," he said on ABC. "I think it would be a 
mistake for Saddam Hussein to try to close down all those embassies in Kuwait." 
But, Cheney added, "He's done foolish things before." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said today that the armed services will call about 46,700 reserves 
to active duty over the next five weeks to strengthen the military forces 
opposing Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The first calls to members of the National Guard and armed forces reserves will 
be placed as early as Friday, and about 9,800 part-time soldiers will have been 
called to leave their civilian jobs by the end of August, said Pete Williams, 
the Pentagon press secretary.

A Colorado work camp escapee was flushed out of a top-floor room of a bay-side 
hotel today, about two hours after police rescued a security guard he had held 
hostage for 32 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified as Randy Dolph, was arrested about 10:45 a.m. after 
police shot tear gas into the ninth-floor room of the Harbor Island Travelodge, 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff began to end about 8:50 a.m. after the security guard, Donnie 
Evans, 56, of El Cajon was rescued by police, who had sent a tray of food to 
the hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"The hostage was sent by the suspect to retrieve the tray of food outside. When 
Evans did that he was grabbed by police officers, who were on both sides of the 
door," Robinson said.

GLASS IN THE TANK LINKED TO SHUTTLE LEAK

Tiny glass beads that somehow got into a fuel line are believed to have caused 
a hydrogen leak that grounded the space shuttle Columbia in May, a NASA 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers discovered between 100 and 200 glass beads between one-thousandth and 
three-thousandths of an inch in diameter inside a piece of equipment found 
leaking on the shuttle, said William Lenoir, associate administrator for space 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
The beads were found about two weeks ago when the leaky piece of equipment, a 
so-called disconnect assembly used to mate the shuttle to its external fuel 
tank, was sent to the Parker Hannifin Corp. in Irvine, where it was made, 
Lenoir said. 
</P>
<P>
The beads could have gotten between a shaft in the disconnect assembly and a 
seal that prevents the hydrogen fuel from leaking, causing the problem, Lenoir 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are uncertain how the beads could have gotten into the disconnect 
assembly but were working with the company to find out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only clue so far was that the beads were used at the company for other 
purposes when the disconnect was made in 1986, he said. The beads are used for 
a variety of manufacturing processes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much question in our minds that that's implicated in why did the 
external tank disconnect shaft seals leak. We've been unable to find 
definitively how they got there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way that's good news because that says, 'Hey, there's some external 
something contamination that led to the leak.' And we just need to make sure we 
don't have that (in the future)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle Columbia, which has been fitted with a new disconnect mechanism, is 
scheduled to blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sept. 1 for 
a nine-day astronomy mission that was postponed by the leak in May. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done everything we could think to do to increase the probability of 
launching," Lenoir said. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle Atlantis, which was grounded by a hydrogen leak in July that 
resulted from an unrelated problem, is currently undergoing repairs. That delay 
postponed a secret military mission.

The republic of Armenia passed a declaration of independence today and Estonia 
began formal negotiations with Kremlin officials on separation, bringing the 
Soviet Union closer to fragmentation. 
</P>
<P>
Armenia, a republic of 3.3 million people on the border with Turkey and Iran, 
is the fifth of the 15 Soviet republics to move toward complete independence 
from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
However, its path may be complicated by the bloody two-year conflict with 
neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration calls for creation of Armenia's own armed forces to safeguard 
the border, which this week was again the scene of violent conflict with 
Azerbaijanis. The declaration also calls for Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely 
Armenian area of Azerbaijan, to become part of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian resolution "declares the beginning of the process of establishing 
independent statehood," according to an English translation sent to the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian legislator Samvel Shakhmuradyan said he expects the republic to remain 
part of the Soviet Union only during an undefined transitional period to 
complete separation. 
</P>
<P>
Armenia's decision increases pressure on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is 
struggling to develop a new union treaty attractive enough to keep his nation 
whole. However, Gorbachev seems to be bowing to Baltic demands for complete 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
Kremlin officials began formal negotiations with the Baltic republic of Estonia 
today, the 51st anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet pact that led to Soviet 
annexation of the Baltic states. The two other Baltics, Latvia and Lithuania, 
are expected to begin independence negotiations with Soviet representatives 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Baltics and Armenia, Georgia has also declared independence 
and wants to hold independence negotiations with the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Armenia's Parliament rejected a radical proposal to declare independence 
effective immediately, as well as a Communist Party proposal to be "independent 
but remain in the Soviet Union," said Raffi Hovannisian, an Armenian-American 
who watched the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was approved by a vote of 183 to 2, Shakhmuradyan said in a 
telephone interview from Yerevan, the capital of the small republic. The 
resolution invalidates the Soviet Constitution on Armenian territory and says 
that only the Armenian Constitution is in effect, Shakhmuradyan said. 
</P>
<P>
It demands a share of the Soviet national wealth including gold, diamonds and 
foreign currency reserves. It calls for the creation of Armenia's own currency, 
banking system and customs duties.

IRAN NEWS SAYS IRISH HOSTAGE WILL BE FREED

<P>
The official Iranian news agency reported today that a European hostage held in 
Lebanon would be freed soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency, quoting an "informed source," said the 
hostage to be freed was likely to be Brian Keenan, an Irish national held since 
April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, did not name the source but correspondents in both 
its Beirut and Damascus office said the report was accurate. They said they did 
not know specifically when the release would take place. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency carried a similar report on an imminent release in July, which 
proved false. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, a source close to the Syrian command, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the Syrian government was notified two days ago of the decision 
to free a European hostage, probably Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
He said arrangements have since been discussed on where, when and how the 
release will take place. 
</P>
<P>
The source said he believes the hostage will be handed to the Syrian 
authorities somewhere in Lebanon and will be delivered by the Foreign Ministry 
in Damascus to the Irish ambassador there. 
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, the Department of Foreign Affairs said, "We are aware of the report 
and would point to its speculative nature." 
</P>
<P>
Gerben Meihuizen, the Dutch ambassador to Syria, said he had "no confirmation" 
of the report. The Netherlands handles Irish interests in Damascus while their 
non-resident ambassador, Declan Connolly, is based in Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
A source at the ministry of information in Damascus said they had no immediate 
information about the release. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan's family in Northern Ireland reacted cautiously to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan, 39, was kidnaped on April 11, 1986, in West Beirut while walking to his 
job as an English teacher at the American University in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen Westerners are believed held by extremist Muslim groups in Lebanon. In 
addition to Keenan, they include six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans 
and an Italian. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East 
correspondent of the Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Two Swiss Red Cross workers were released separately earlier this month.

The Zodiac gunman was a no-show again. 
</P>
<P>
Police ended their fourth dragnet of the summer today without catching the 
shooter, who has killed one man and injured three others since March 8 and has 
promised to strike again. 
</P>
<P>
The Zodiac task force went out Wednesday night anticipating a possible pre-dawn 
attack by the astrology-obsessed gunman, who apparently has not shot anyone 
since June 21. 
</P>
<P>
This morning was considered key because it was 63 days from the gunman's last 
attack. The four shootings attributed to Zodiac between March 8 and June 21 
have been on Thursdays at intervals of 21 or 63 days. 
</P>
<P>
Also of possible significance: The astrological sign of Virgo began today. The 
gunman has vowed in rambling letters to police and the news media to shoot one 
person for each of the 12 signs of the Zodiac. So far, his victims have been a 
Scorpio, a Taurus, a Gemini and a Cancer.

Developer Donald Trump has taken the Trump Shuttle off the auction block, a 
spokeswoman confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
The move came shortly after Trump's $65-million bank bailout was officially 
completed. Part of the rescue plan requires Trump, whose debt is estimated to 
total $3.2 billion, to sell some assets. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's bankers had been pressing for the sale of the shuttle, which had been 
losing money and draining cash flow at his business empire. 
</P>
<P>
A Trump spokeswoman noted that an upswing in business at the shuttle and 
certain changes in operations have helped make the carrier profitable.

WINE COUNTRY GIRDS FOR INVASION OF DESTRUCTIVE PEST

The wine bug phylloxera, which devastated the world's vineyards a century ago, 
is back, and experts say California vintners may have to spend about $500 
million during the next decade to thwart the pest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's costly, but they will just have to bite the bullet," said Jeffrey 
Grannett, an entomologist on the University of California's Phylloxera Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the type of thing that's going to be widely felt over many years." 
</P>
<P>
Vintners in Sonoma and Napa counties, California's premium winegrowing areas, 
are getting ready to replant vineyards with vines resistant to phylloxera 
(pronounced fih-LOX-eh-rah), a burrowing plant louse. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fisher, a partner in Motto, Kryla &amp; Fisher, a wine industry accounting 
firm, estimated that more than 13,000 acres of vineyard will be replanted in 
the Napa Valley alone. 
</P>
<P>
Replanting costs up to $15,000 an acre and means three to five years of lost 
production while the new vines reach maturity. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 90 sightings of the pest in the valley and 12 in Sonoma County, 
Fisher wrote recently in the trade publication Wine Industry Update. 
</P>
<P>
The winegrowing regions of France and California were ruined by phylloxera 
between 1870 and 1900. Vineyard acreage dropped from 20,000 to 3,000 in the 
fledgling industry in Napa County.

W. GERMAN FIRMS PROBED ON IRAQ EXPORTS; 
</P>

ARMS TRADE: SEVEN PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED, ABOUT 25 FIRMS ARE UNDER SUSPICION AND 
34 FIRMS FACE FINES FOR ILLEGAL WEAPONS OR TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS.

<P>
Nearly 60 West German firms are being investigated for illegal arms exports to 
Iraq, the government said today, urging industry to police itself to purge the 
embarrassing trade. 
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said about 25 firms are under suspicion for 
earlier criminal violations that had grabbed headlines because of the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
A further 34 firms face possible fines for smaller offenses involving illegal 
weapons or technology exports to Iraq, the Economics Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany arrested seven people Friday on suspicion of supplying Iraq with 
equipment to make poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann said in a statement that export control laws are being sharply 
tightened, and he urged West German industry and business "to be especially 
careful in its dealings with the export control law." 
</P>
<P>
"Even negligent violations of the export control law can cause great damage to 
West Germany's reputation as a solid partner in international trade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Current events in Iraq and Kuwait show that sensitive technology in the hands 
of unscrupulous rulers can threaten whole regions of the world and even world 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Careful dealings with such technology must therefore be in the utmost interest 
of German industry itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The economics ministry said 38 people are being investigated from the 25 firms 
suspected of violating the export laws in connection with deliveries to Iraq of 
plants and parts for the production of chemical weapons and munitions. 
</P>
<P>
West German law bans the sale of weapons to conflict areas, which have included 
Iraq for years, and exporters have to obtain permission to export sensitive 
equipment or plans. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann said the laws had been steadily tightened since early 1989 to boost 
the maximum prison sentence for violations to 10 years from three. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament will pass a law soon to allow a maximum 15-year sentence for cases 
involving nuclear or chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago the head of the West German chemical firm Imhausen was jailed 
for five years for supplying another Arab country -- Libya -- with equipment to 
make deadly nerve gases at its Rabta chemical plant.

ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS, LED BY AIRCRAFT, SURGE 2.9% IN JULY

<P>
New orders for durable goods showed surprising strength in July, jumping 2.9% 
on strong demand for aircraft and other big-ticket items, but shipments were 
weak, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Private analysts expected a gain of only 0.3% in orders for expensive goods 
made to last three or more years, following a drop of 3.2% in June and an 
advance of 4.1% in May. 
</P>
<P>
The July increase, to just over $128.3 billion, was attributed to a surge in 
orders for new aircraft and parts as the world's airlines scramble to rebuild 
their aging fleets. 
</P>
<P>
There were also increased orders for turbines, computers and metals. But orders 
for new cars, vans and trucks declined. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp in Philadelphia, was not 
impressed by the data. "It does not portend strength in the economy," he said. 
"The economy is very weak."

BENCHMARK U.S. CRUDE SURGES PAST $32 A BARREL ON MIDEAST ANXIETIES 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil prices surged above $32 a barrel today on profound worries that the United 
States and Iraq are headed toward a military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the benchmark U.S. crude oil was 83 cents higher, at $32.05 per 
42-gallon barrel, in afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the 
world's leading petroleum market. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures prices have risen nearly 40% since Iraq invaded Kuwait on 
Aug. 2, as the elimination of 4 million barrels daily of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil 
from world markets tightens supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Even the prospects of increased production by other nations are waning. 
Analysts said the needs of foreign military forces in Saudi Arabia could devour 
any increases by that nation, the world's largest producer. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the market blew through the $30-a-barrel level Wednesday gave 
rise to the feeling that prices have much higher to go," said Tom Bentz, 
trading director at United Energy Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any kind of military conflict, prices could go to $40 or $50 a 
barrel," the trader said. 
</P>
<P>
In early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for 
September delivery surged 5.14 cents over Wednesday to $1.0925 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Home heating oil was up 4.25 cents, to 95.60 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Beutel, vice president of Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York, said a 
fire at a Shell Oil Co. refinery in Deer Park, Tex., also was a factor in the 
rise of gasoline prices, given that U.S. refineries are operating near 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
On the European cash market, the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Light -- the key 
OPEC crude from the Middle East shipped mainly to the Far East -- was up 25 
cents at midday to $29.90 a barrel. It had shot up $3.30 a barrel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's widely traded North Sea Brent gained 40 cents, to $31.95 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Gulf Coast cash market, West Texas Intermediate had added 75 cents 
over Wednesday to $31.75 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the nation's top antitrust prosecutor said today that he had 
summoned the major oil companies for talks to determine whether they used 
illegal tactics to drive up gasoline prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I have called the major oil companies and requested that they come in on a 
one-by-one basis to meet with the staff and on several occasions with me," said 
Assistant Atty. Gen. James Rill, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Already, representatives of three major oil companies and two independent 
marketers have met with some of the 10 antitrust officials working on the 
inquiry, Rill told reporters at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the meetings is to have the company representatives explain the 
industry's price practices, "the circumstances of the sharp increases in detail 
and the reasons why those increases have occurred," he said.

WHEN IN ROME, COOPER INTENDS TO HOOP IT UP

Michael Cooper is ready to prove himself all over again. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 productive years with the Los Angeles Lakers, the 34-year-old Cooper 
spent his first day with his new team -- Il Messaggero Roma of the Italian 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let the age fool you," Cooper said Wednesday. "Physically I feel like 
I'm 24 or 25 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and 23-year-old Yugoslav center Dino Radja are the latest additions to 
the team that last year featured Danny Ferry and Brian Shaw, both back in the 
United States and set to play in the NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
Il Messaggero club President Carlo Sama said the average age of his team is 23 
years old. He added that Cooper's experience -- and five NBA titles -- could 
help instill a winning attitude. 
</P>
<P>
When the question about age was translated for Cooper, he quickly added: 
"That's the problem with the NBA. They have a tendency to think that when 
you're past 30 your playing days are over. But being 34 and playing with the 
Lakers, that's not the case with me. I really haven't played that much since I 
was always the sixth man." 
</P>
<P>
The Rome newspaper Il Messaggero, which sponsors the team, already has a 
nickname for Cooper -- "Papa Cooper." 
</P>
<P>
"My main role is to be a leader," Cooper said. "It's a young ballclub and my 
age and experience could be a key factor." 
</P>
<P>
Aware that Ferry and Shaw did not bring Messaggero a league title, Cooper 
sought to keep fans' expectations in check. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Cooper cannot win a championship by himself," he said. "But with Dino 
and the other fine players, I think we definitely can win a championship." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper reportedly will earn more than the $600,000 per year he made with the 
Lakers. "Dollars and cents are not a priority for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing was that Messaggero was interested in me as a basketball 
player. After that the financial reasons came into play." 
</P>
<P>
Although he weighs only 176 pounds, the 6-foot-7 Cooper looks forward to the 
extremely physical play in the Italian league. 
</P>
<P>
"The style of play is a lot rougher than the NBA," he said. "But I like bump 
and grind. Hopefully I can enjoy that part." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's eyes lit up when reminded that the 3-point line in Italy is closer 
than in the NBA, where he holds the career mark for 3-point baskets in playoff 
games, with 124 in 316 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely very excited about that," he said. "Hopefully a lot more shots 
will go in."

World figure-skating champion Jill Trenary said today that she will remain an 
amateur with a goal of winning a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody once told me it's not the things you do in your life that you regret, 
it's the things you don't do," Trenary said during a news conference at the 
Broadmoor Hotel. "So, with that in mind and after a lot of thought, I've 
decided to stay in until the '92 Olympics in Albertville (France)." 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, 22, holds the 1990 world and U.S. figure-skating titles. She has won 
the national title three times in the last four years.

LIZ SMITH: ZSA ZSA'S LIGHTS ARE UNDIMMED BY HER TIME IN JAIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
IT WAS Zsa Zsa Gabor herself, in person, at "Grand Hotel" in New York the other 
evening. She clapped and carried on, saying how much she loved the Broadway 
musical. Then, Zsa Zsa let NBC producer Carl Killingsworth whisk her off after 
to dinner at the intimate bistro Tout Va Bien. (No fool Zsa Zsa, she carried 
home to her hubby, Prince Frederick Von Anhalt, who hadn't wanted to go out, a 
doggie bag of what the French waitresses at Tout call pommes frites.) 
</P>
<P>
Jail doesn't seem to have dimmed Zsa Zsa's lights. She appears none the worse 
for her experience, saying: "There were all kinds of women in jail; one big 
butch number and another very feminine one. I didn't care for either of them. . 
. . You know, in World War II, I went from Budapest to Berlin to Bel-Air with 
great success. Maybe what I need is another war." 
</P>
<P>
MAYBE you recall several weeks back when this space reported a split between 
those "The Amazing Teddy Z" stars -- Jon Cryer and Jane Sibbett. (They'd been 
cozier off screen than they had on.) At that time, Jane phoned from Los Angeles 
to say that there wasn't a breakup and that "my mother would be heartbroken if 
we split." Her words were so noted here. 
</P>
<P>
But today, I'm worried about Jane's mother because a very single Jon Cryer is 
in New York, fresh from negotiating with ABC about a new series. And fresh from 
what I hear is a final and definite split with Jane. Tonight, Jon will be at 
the official TriBeCa opening of the David Dennis eatery, Les Poulets. 
</P>
<P>
WENT TO a marvelous party at the New York apartment of PR man Peter Brown (he 
once helped mastermind the Beatles and also wrote one of the best books ever 
about them). Peter poured in honor of his pal Andrew Lloyd Webber and Andrew's 
new ladyfriend, Madeleine Gurdon. 
</P>
<P>
A stellar crowd turned out to get a look at the happy couple -- the New York 
Times' Punch Sulzberger, Arthur Gelb and Abe Rosenthal; agent Lynn Nesbit; 
Vanity Fair's Dominick Dunne and Caroline Graham; Broadway's Barbara and 
Charles ("Annie") Strouse; singer Christopher Mason; novelist Shirley Lord, and 
country/Western's Larry Gatlin. 
</P>
<P>
The British tabloids have recently noted that Andrew -- the richest and most 
prolific man in London and Broadway theater -- has been "done over" by his new 
friend. They say Madeleine, an upper-class blonde who pals around with the 
Royals and the horsy set, has turned Andrew into "an upright, short-haired, 
boyish prince." 
</P>
<P>
Well, hyperbole aside, I've never seen Andrew looking so well, so trim, so 
splendid. And Madeleine is a charmer, very bright, and with a good sense of 
humor for a person who'd never endured New York before. I hear she gets along 
smashingly with Andrew's first wife, Sarah, and with his children. Madeleine 
has never met the second Mrs. W. -- Sarah Brightman, who starred in "Phantom" 
in London and New York and will now make the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew and Sarah II are getting a divorce and once that's done, I think we can 
safely say that Madeleine will become Mrs. A.L.W.

Performers in a Soviet circus troupe whose dreams of fame in America vanished 
as debts mounted and animals were seized were headed home today after being 
stranded here since May. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine members of the bankrupt Great Circus Bim Bom, whose two-year U.S. 
tour was cut short just after it began, were due to fly to Leningrad from New 
York this afternoon, said the New York promoter for a rival Soviet circus who 
is financing the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ended. Our trip, our journey is ended. All our hopes are broken. I hope 
next time will be better," lamented Great Circus Bim Bom Music Director Boris 
Rivchun. 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen circus staff plan to stay in Atlanta temporarily to seek release of 
the troupe's animals and equipment to return them to the Soviet Union, said 
Artistic Director Yuri Turkin. 
</P>
<P>
He said a few performers had found work in Canada and Chicago and another group 
returned to the Soviet Union from Las Vegas several weeks ago.

DID BAD BOY BART MAKE BILL COSBY CHANGE HIS SHOW? 'NO WAY MAN!!!'

Bill Cosby was wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt with the radical dude saying "Yo, 
Bill!" when he was asked if upcoming changes in "The Cosby Show" are a response 
to competition from "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
"All of the changes were made B.B. -- Before Bart," Cosby told Entertainment 
Weekly in an interview being published next week. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine cover features Cosby wearing the Bart shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Fox TV's runaway hit "The Simpsons" has moved from Sunday nights to Thursday, 
challenging NBC's top-rated "The Cosby Show," in a Bart vs. Bill match-up as 
TV's top pop prepares to battle the smart-aleck Bart Simpson. Both air tonight 
at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The shows will be programmed head to head for the first time tonight, although 
they are both reruns. "The Cosby Show" starts its new shows in September, a 
full month before Fox will have new offerings of "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
Does Cosby feel pressured? In his own conversational style, he seems critical 
of Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"TV should be moving in a direction from the Huxtables forward, not backward," 
Cosby said. "The mean-spirited and cruel think this (the screwed-up Fox 
families like the bewildered Simpsons and the bitter Bundys of "Married . . . 
With Children") is 'the edge,' and their excuse is, that's the way people are 
today. But why should we be entertained by that?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby said he's changing "The Cosby Show," re-energizing it with nine new 
writers, as a matter of principle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working harder and enjoying it more. And whether the audience is there in 
the numbers or not, I am proud of what we've done," Cosby said.

Mourners wound around the block today to say farewell to singer Pearl Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
Deliverance Evangelical Evangelistic Church opened its doors at 10 a.m. for the 
viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The service and burial was set for later today. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should have opened the doors last night," said the Rev. Steven 
Parks, the West Oak Lane Church of God associate pastor who was among the first 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bailey was 72 when she died Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital 
after collapsing in her hotel room. The singer was recuperating from knee 
surgery. A preliminary autopsy report indicated that she died of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
She made her debut in Philadelphia at age 15 by singing "Poor Butterfly" in an 
amateur contest. Among her best-known performances was her lead role in the 
black version of the musical "Hello, Dolly!" in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Bailey was one of the greatest recording artists and one of the most 
talented people in the world," remarked James Brooks, a Philadelphia native now 
living in Los Angeles, as he walked into the church. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said he had met the singer numerous times.

Attorneys for Rodney Dangerfield want to bar allegations that the comedian was 
a chronic drug and alcohol abuser from his trial against a Las Vegas resort. 
</P>
<P>
In motions filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, attorneys for Dangerfield 
said the allegations were untrue and without foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The motions ask that all evidence of alleged substance abuse be excluded from 
Dangerfield's civil trial against Caesars Palace, which was scheduled to begin 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerfield's attorney, John Lusk, said today that the trial has been postponed 
until Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Caesars Palace attorneys filed court papers earlier in the week, claiming that 
Dangerfield smokes marijuana regularly, drinks vodka heavily and often uses 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The claims by the resort were made to show that Dangerfield was responsible for 
canceling a series of shows at Caesars in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerfield sued Caesars for $225,000 in disputed contract money and medical 
and legal bills, claiming that his eyes were burned in a steam bath accident at 
the resort. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney said he has never seen his client use drugs. The 64-year-old 
Dangerfield has also denied any drug use.

ISLAND COOKING: THE FANTASY &amp; THE REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
THE CULT OF THE TROPICS USED TO BE RUM DRINKS AND PUPU PLATERS; NOW IT'S 
BROILED LOBSTER WITH FRIED LEEKS.

<P>
For generations, Americans have sighed for tropics, where all you ever have to 
do (so goes the story) is reach up from your hammock once in a while and grab a 
papaya. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the cult of the tropics reeks of the fantasies of people in cold 
climates: easy manners, outdoor living, no snow to shovel. In a way it's just a 
sweatier version of the usual Snow Belters' fantasy of California. It seems 
strange that it ever had a hold on Californians themselves, but it certainly 
did. Maybe it goes back to the Twenties, when Margaret Meade was advertising 
Polynesia as a sexual paradise and everybody was playing the ukulele and 
learning a dance called the hula-hula. 
</P>
<P>
In the '40s and '50s the cult of the tropics spawned a thing called Polynesian 
Cuisine, which was by nature sweet, alcoholic and served aflame: a mixture of 
Cantonese appetizers, vaguely Indonesian entrees involving pineapple and 
coconut, and savage rum drinks with names like Missionary's Downfall. The 
cuisine has fallen into disrepute now, along with the idea of serving drinks 
with little paper parasols in them, but for years Trader Vic's, Don the 
Beachcomber's and their imitations were considered exceptionally classy places 
to dine. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Tropics seem to have returned as a restaurant motif. Air travel 
has made people a little too sophisticated for the old Polynesian Cuisine so 
the new version stresses "light fresh flavors," but this is still not quite the 
real story either. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the people of the Tropics tend to eat starchy food, both because of 
their poverty and because of the hard work they do. It's not dull food, but 
also not at all what you'd call light. There is some truth to the vision of 
tropical cuisine full of exotic fruits and spices: In the Caribbean they often 
use curry spices. On the other hand, Polynesia knew of no spices at all before 
the 18th Century and is still cautious about using them. And as for fruits, 
Polynesia never saw the pineapple, mango or papaya until the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Alas for the pupu platter, the flaming rum drinks and the vision of a little 
grass shack. Today we know the reality of tropical cuisine. Fortunately, it's 
more interesting than the fiction.

SAVVY HICKSTER; 
</P>
<P>
SINGER VICTORIA WILLIAMS MAY BE RUSTICATED, BUT SHE ISN'T NAIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of people go into pop music so they can be hipsters. But Victoria 
Williams is unusual. You might call the Los Angeles-based singer a hickster. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who hails from Forbing, La., has released two albums marked by a 
sense of old-time, rural innocence. On her 1987 debut album "Happy Come Home" 
and the new "Swing the Statue," she unaffectedly weaves yarns that could be her 
own take on the Southern tradition of fable-spinning embodied in the Uncle 
Remus tales. Vocally, she can sound like a rusticated, more ethereal Rickie Lee 
Jones, keeping the improvisational, storytelling aspects of Jones' approach but 
jettisoning the hipper, urban jazz instincts. Williams' sense of roots comes 
out in fine, authentic-sounding readings of gospel and Cajun songs. 
</P>
<P>
Like traditional fables, Williams' songs tend to have morals to them. She 
celebrates simple verities, like the lovely constancy of the moon, or the 
humility and goodness of the rural characters she portrays in songs like "T.C." 
and "Statue of a Bum." But Williams is not naive. As sweet and whimsical as her 
songs can be, they are full of emotional complexities and the recognition that 
life is full of existential aches and contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' career path led her from Louisiana to Colorado to Los Angeles to New 
York (a stay commemorated in some song-verses about singing happily on a 
subway), then back to Los Angeles. She married singer-songwriter Peter Case, 
making them the George Jones and Tammy Wynette of the L.A. folkie scene for a 
time until they divorced last year. 
</P>
<P>
While she debuted on a major label, Geffen, Williams' follow-up is on a smaller 
independent, Rough Trade. That may be the commercial price to be paid for a 
performer whose distinctive sound and sensibility branch off like an enchanting 
woodland creek, running far from the mainstream.

DUK SOON NAM WILL ADD SENTIMENTAL NOTE TO GARDEN GROVER CONCERT

Expect some sentimental and delicate singing before the live cannons and bells 
blow away you and the neighbors around the Village Green Park in Garden Grove 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The noisy part will come when the Garden Grove Symphony puts the finishing 
touches on its annual "Summer Symphony in the Park" concert with Tchaikovsky's 
rousing, patriotic "1812" Overture. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody these days dreams of playing this music without real cannons blasting 
and big bells clanging. Certainly not conductor Edward Peterson and the Garden 
Grove Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
They're all part of the composer's celebratory portrait of the Muscovites' 
triumph over Bonaparte and of his humiliated, defeated troops burning the city 
as they withdraw from it. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier in the concert, there will be the harmonious, barbershop-style 
singing by the 40-member Orange Empire Chorus and two Korean folk songs sung by 
soprano Duk Soon Nam. 
</P>
<P>
Nam will sing "Diamond Mountain" and "Lovely Flower," and if her eyes grow a 
little misty during the first of these, it's because she's thinking of her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
There is a real Diamond Mountain, Nam said through a translator this week. But 
it's located in closed-off North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who looks at Diamond Mountain feels wonderful," Nam said. "It is a 
little different from any other mountain in Korea. Nothing else is like it. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I sing this song, I remember my parents, who (fled) from North 
Korea. They miss it." 
</P>
<P>
The song, says Nam, tells "in a beautiful melody" the effect the mountain has 
on people. "But there is also a little story about freedom and unity," Nam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the soprano is not greatly optimistic that she or her parents will soon 
have a chance to see the mountain again. 
</P>
<P>
Unity of the two Koreas remains a distant goal, she feels. 
</P>
<P>
"We can unite through music," Nam ventured cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic soprano who sings opera and lieder, Nam studied in Germany and Italy 
as well as in her native county. She splits her time between Orange County -- 
which has one of the largest congregations of Korean-Americans in the nation -- 
and her home in Seoul, Korea. 
</P>
<P>
She last sang with the Garden Grove Symphony on a New Year's Eve program in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Nam also is one of the founding directors of the Orange County Korean-American 
Children's Choir, a chorus of about 50 kids, which was started last year. 
</P>
<P>
Future plans include singing in a new opera in Seoul and with the Santa Ana 
Symphony, directed by Chong J. Park, on a date not yet set next year. 
</P>
<P>
Who: Korean soprano Duk Soon Nam will sing on the Garden Grove Symphony's 
"Summer in Park" program. 
</P>
<P>
When: Saturday, Aug. 25, at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Village Green Park, Euclid and Main Streets, Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: Garden Grove Freeway (22) to Euclid exit; north to Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
Where to call: (714) 534-1103.
