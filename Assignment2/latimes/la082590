Remus and Romulus founded Rome. And, now, Silvana and Stefania Maisano, Italy's 
latest set of creative twins, have found Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But the Genoese-born sculptors encountered problems -- in fact, a couple of 
them -- trying to install their works in a new complex called Two Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
A fountain designed by Silvana flooded Friday (fortunately for the twins, the 
Drought Police weren't in the neighborhood). 
</P>
<P>
And a pillar designed by Stefania -- the twins usually work on separate art 
pieces -- is being detained by U.S. Customs because the paperwork isn't 
complete. (Oddly enough, a second pillar sailed through.) 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty mad," said publicist Alex Auerbach, "particularly about the 
pillar. They can't understand why there's no way to lubricate the Customs 
process with a few dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Only in L.A. Menu Item of the Week: "California-Mexican roll" at La Cocina 
restaurant in Signal Hill. It's a tortilla filled with chicken, tomato and 
cheese, then cut and wrapped with lettuce to look like sushi. 
</P>
<P>
"Cop Rock," TV's police musical, is being touted as a revolutionary idea. But 
it's the same old song for the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that the sheriff's deputies who perform in the group 
Manhunter don't sing at work, like the stars of "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
With a repertoire that includes such cop-oriented original tunes as "It's a 
Mystery" and "Driving Fast," Manhunter has played at the Crazy Horse in Santa 
Ana as well as at several anti-drug telethons and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the nature of show biz and cop biz, Manhunter's cast has undergone 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Van Mosley plans to work on his own album. David Leicht, a former 
member, is now a deputy in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Leicht wrote "Driving Fast," the story of a wild police pursuit narrated by the 
cop riding shotgun: 
</P>
<P>
"Had my feet on the dash and we were haulin'," it begins. 
</P>
<P>
Manhunter plays various styles of music, but "'Driving Fast,"' said Leicht, "is 
definitely rock." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Disneyland has changed its mind about replacing its robotic Abe 
Lincoln with Kermit the Frog at a park exhibit, the question remains: Where to 
put the loquacious Muppet? 
</P>
<P>
May we suggest a troubled Disney-operated attraction with a more fitting name. 
How about making Kermit the Frog the host of the Spruce Goose? There'd even be 
room inside for Miss Piggy.

L.A. may be the only U.S. city to have a Beethoven Market. It stocks no

The Braude law has little to do with smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to find restaurants with little or no smoking. The Braudes of the 
world didn't do that with their regulations. People did it all by their little 
selves. 
</P>
<P>
The Braude rule is about the degree to which governments more and more 
micro-manage businesses and the lives of people. 
</P>
<P>
Look in Braude's jacket pocket. I'll bet you'll find his draft of a law 
regulating which side of the street smokers may walk on. His restrictions 
belong in the ashtray.

ANTI-CIGARETTE DECISIONS AND SMOKING BANS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled to read that Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs rationalized his 
opposition to a restaurant smoking ban by dismissing it as a matter of exposure 
to "a few hours of smoke." As a physician who cares for the victims of smoking 
on a day-to-day basis, I would like to assure the councilman that the issues 
involved in the exposure of the public to environmental cigarette smoke are far 
more profound than he apparently realizes. 
</P>
<P>
One need not be a physician to realize that thousands of restaurant workers 
confront far more than "a few hours" of exposure and that they are not in the 
least protected by voluntary nonsmoking areas. Recent evidence on the effects 
of passive smoking suggest that these workers may face an increased cancer 
risk. Customers' exposure to passive smoke, although less than that of 
employees, adds up over months and years. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the Beverly Hills restaurant smoking ban demonstrated the 
hazards of a piecemeal approach to this problem. A statewide restaurant smoking 
ban would eliminate restaurant owners' concerns about smokers' boycotts of 
restaurants in communities with smoking bans. In the meantime, local efforts 
such as Braude's will protect some of us from the hazards of passive smoke 
exposure and will pave the way for broader action.

CAMERA READY?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keeping Americans interested in public affairs requires both press and 
television. To their shame, California TV stations closed down their Sacramento 
bureaus years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So it is hardly surprising that a recent poll showed that only 12% of 
Californians could name their state representatives and another poll showed 
that some even think Congress runs California, with help from some governor. 
</P>
<P>
A foundation-funded group, California Channel, has begun televising Assembly 
sessions, feeding coverage through cable networks to about 2 million viewers, 
hoping to reduce what it calls the isolation of Sacramento from the people. 
</P>
<P>
One hopes that the exercise will disprove the allegation that the California 
Legislature doesn't do much, or that what it does it doesn't do very well. Or 
at least one hopes that televising Assembly sessions will give the politicians 
a chance to win back the public's favor, demonstrate their political skills, 
rally public opinion behind their work. 
</P>
<P>
Has anything changed in the first weeks of the telecasts? Well, one member 
showed up on the floor with a paper bag over his head. Some members are wearing 
brighter neckties. The quality of dialogue has not greatly improved. One member 
recently called for a vote on his "good bill" without mentioning what the bill 
was about. Weird. 
</P>
<P>
But it took time for people to lose interest in state government. It will take 
more than a three-week test to draw their attention back. The Legislature can 
make television coverage permanent for less than it used to spend to print 
constituent newsletters. It should keep the cameras on.

CURBING HIGHWAY UGLINESS; 
</P>
<P>
BILLBOARD-CONTROL MEASURES TO ADVANCE ROADSIDE BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring has sprung, the grass has riz, where last year's careless drivers is. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Burma Shave road sign, circa 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Billboards sort of went straight downhill from there, as did the politics of 
"outdoor advertising": A loophole in Lady Bird Johnson's pet project, the 1965 
Highway Beautification Act, has so far fed $200 million from public coffers to 
billboard owners. 
</P>
<P>
Pending federal legislation would bring the law more into keeping with Mrs. 
Johnson's original beautification goal. 
</P>
<P>
The act was intended to stop the proliferation of billboards along federally 
funded highways. The signs are supposed to be restricted to commercially zoned 
areas. But owners of illegally positioned boards must be reimbursed by the 
government for the cost of the sign and lost potential income when they 
relocate them. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, until recently, billboard owners, whether in compliance with the act 
or not, were free to cut down trees growing on public land that clutter the 
motorist's view of their advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the doomed trees were planted with tax dollars in accordance with the 
very same legislation! 
</P>
<P>
But now there are bills before both U.S. and California lawmakers to 
permanently halt tree-cutting for the exclusive purpose of making billboards 
more visible. And dozens of U.S. legislators have endorsed measures to end the 
Byzantine imbroglio. Both the House Billboard Control Act and its Senate 
counterpart, the Visual Pollution Control Act, prohibit new signs along certain 
highways and interstates and would give local governments control over removing 
existing billboards. 
</P>
<P>
They should consider the technique of amortization, the standard procedure used 
for compensating advertisers until 1978: Sign owners would be allowed to leave 
a billboard in place long enough to earn back its cost and some profit. 
</P>
<P>
We are paying advertisers not to block our view of America's natural wonders. 
It's time to rescue both Mrs. Johnson's dream of uncluttered scenery and 
millions of dollars in public funds.

CONTROVERSY OVER FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am convinced that the National Endowment for the Arts should be completely 
dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
Many artists are in an uproar because the government wants to tell them what to 
do -- and what not to do. 
</P>
<P>
If artists cannot make a living without government help, they should find some 
other work. A capitalist government has no business funding any art projects. 
But let's face it folks, with our tax dollars funding art projects, we are like 
any other socialist government. 
</P>
<P>
Our tax dollars are going toward such "works" as a nude woman smearing food on 
her body, a portrait of Jesus Christ hanging on the cross while immersed in 
urine, and other very offensive things. This is totally unacceptable to me. 
</P>
<P>
So I have one thing to say to these so called "artists": If you cannot make a 
living without government help, go find some other work where you can make a 
living! Quit your moaning and complaining!

<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who has ever tried to explain the world to a child will have directly 
experienced the core difficulty in dealing with the Persian Gulf situation. 
After three or four why questions and because answers, we run out of 
comprehensible explanations. The understanding of any human event is not far 
removed from realms of deep mystery, vast ignorance and blind faith. 
</P>
<P>
That enduring fact, which is the source of familiar exasperation in dealing 
with the profound simplicity of a child's questions, is also a prime source of 
danger and tragedy in dealing with the use of military power. It is difficult 
to connect destructive actions with justifying purposes, particularly given the 
intense emotions that arise in armed confrontations. The consequences of war 
nearly always deviate from original intentions, and whatever the outcome, 
heartfelt tragedy in the lives of many people is always a major ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
As emotions rise and war drums pound in the media on both sides, it is 
important to clarify our purpose. With the instruction of so much bitter 
experience, we ought to have learned by now to ask some simple questions and to 
keep the answers straight. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we resist Iraq's aggression more assertively than the many others we 
have tolerated? The best answer is that we are trying to defend a new, emerging 
international order in which the use of military power is restricted to the 
defense of national territory, and all countries participate in the 
international economy on equitable market terms, and legal principles have 
serious effect. These purposes far transcend questions of the American 
life-style or the assertions of any particular culture. Keeping these purposes 
in mind will help us keep focus on an extremely important fact: The 
confrontation in the Middle East is, above all, a battle for legitimacy, and it 
will be won or lost in those terms. To win, the mobilization of firepower is 
necessary but it is not sufficient alone. 
</P>
<P>
Under the implicit rules of the emerging international order, it is legitimate 
for the United States to defend Saudi Arabia. That will be the judgment of most 
of the world as long as that remains the limit of our military objective. It is 
more legitimate to conduct this defense in cooperation with other major powers, 
and it ultimately will be vital in political terms that we do so. Basically, we 
are asserting that Iraqi aggression is not solely an Arab problem but one of 
overriding concern to the international community. As a practical matter, it is 
questionable that the United States can make that assertion by itself. Acting 
with support of the U.N. Security Council, we can certainly do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense of the new international order clearly requires an unconditional 
withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the reconstitution of an indigenous 
form of government that enjoys the consent of Kuwaiti citizens. It requires as 
well the unconditional release of human hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions and political isolation are the legitimate means for 
achieving this, and fortunately there is good reason to believe that they can 
be effective in due course -- which may mean as much as a year. There is no 
good reason why we cannot sustain the sanctions and the protective deployment 
of military power for a year and longer if required. Yes, it is hot in Saudi 
Arabia. Yes, the military deployment is an unanticipated expense at an awkward 
moment. Yes, it is a major personal burden for those involved. The purposes 
justify, in fact mandate, these costs. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot legitimately accelerate the likely course of resolution by initiating 
the offensive use of military power. We can expect to lose the decisive battle 
for legitimacy if we attempt such an action. 
</P>
<P>
And we cannot legitimately extend our objectives to include a change in Iraq's 
leadership or its political regime, however intensely we may desire it, and 
however popular that course may come to be in the United States. Nor can we 
legitimately commit ourselves to dismantling Iraq's military Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
These temptations, while predictable, present one of the major dangers for the 
United States. The dynamics of emotion, the natural urge to counter 
belligerence, and the practical capabilities that will be available when the 
military mobilization is complete will produce strong impulses for preemptive 
military action. Controlling these impulses will be the primary American 
problem. The battle for legitimacy presents a severe test of balance, 
perspective and patience, not historically our strongest suits. This is a very 
grave matter, and its positive resolution will require a distinct maturation of 
United States policy. That, also, we had best keep uppermost in mind.

DEFENSE FUELS RAIDERS PAST BEARS, 20-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After floundering during a 16-14 exhibition victory over the Dallas Cowboys 
last weekend, the Raiders took a step forward, beating the Chicago Bears, 20-3, 
Friday night before 58,285 at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a lot of heat from everybody last week," quarterback Jay Schroeder 
said. "But we did a great job bouncing back tonight." 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Art Shell is still concerned about the Raider offense, which has 
produced only two touchdowns that weren't set up by the defense in four games. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel better than I did last week," Shell said. "But we still have a lot of 
work to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Raider offense scored only one touchdown against the Bears, with the 
defense setting up another touchdown with a fumble recovery. Jeff Jaeger, who 
has made nine of 10 field goal attempts this exhibition season, was successful 
from 46 and 31 yards after drives stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger's first field goal would have been unnecessary if wide receiver Willie 
Gault hadn't dropped a touchdown pass on the Raiders' first play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
After racing past cornerback Vestee Johnson, Gault had to turn to catch 
Schroeder's pass, but the ball sailed through his outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I misplayed the ball," Gault said. "I thought I had it in the right position, 
but by the time I looked up it was going away. I've been in this league eight 
years, and I've never dropped a pass." 
</P>
<P>
Was Shell disappointed with Gault? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not disappointed, those things are going to happen," Shell said. "Like I 
told him after he dropped it, I said, 'Hey, you're going to get another 
chance.' " 
</P>
<P>
With the score 3-3, Gault gave the Raiders a 10-3 lead when he caught a 26-yard 
touchdown pass from Schroeder with 1:33 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Gault sprinted past defensive back Donnell Woolford, reversed his field on a 
crossing pattern and caught Schroeder's pass in the corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Although that was the only touchdown the offense produced, it was all the 
Raiders needed. Their defense gave up only a 41-yard field goal by Kevin 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well tonight," Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said. "There's no 
reason for it." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders harassed quarterback Mike Tomczak, sacking him four times for 43 
yards in the first half. Defensive end Greg Townsend, playing his first game 
after ending a month-long holdout last Monday, had a sack and linebacker Aaron 
Wallace, the Raiders' No. 2 draft pick, had three sacks for 34 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He had as many sacks tonight as I've had in a season," Raider nose guard Bob 
Golic said of Wallace. "He's right on course for breaking my career record." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Lyle Alzado, making a comeback after a five-year retirement, 
played for the first time this summer. Alzado, who underwent arthroscopic 
surgery on his right knee three weeks ago, intercepted a pass by Bear 
quarterback Jim Harbaugh in the fourth quarter, but the play was nullified 
because Alzado had jumped offsides. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my eyes closed," Alzado said. "Let's be honest. I didn't intercept it, 
he just threw it to me." 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders cutting to 60 players next week, does Alzado think he will 
survive? 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them." Alzado said. "I'm not worrying about it. Everybody saw that 
I can still play with the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
Can Alzado, 41, still perform well enough to play in the NFL? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still capable, and whoever wants to deny it can look at the films 
tonight," Alzado said. "Besides that, how many 41-year-old men have a body like 
this?" 
</P>
<P>
With that, Alzado struck a bodybuilder-like pose. 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders leading, 10-3, after Gault's touchdown catch, quarterback 
Vince Evans replaced Schroeder in the second half and directed the Raiders to a 
field goal and a touchdown that was set up by linebacker Darin Jordan's fumble 
recovery at the Bear 37. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, trying to earn the Raider backup job, put together a six-play drive 
after Jordan's fumble recovery, scrambling away from the Bear defense and 
hitting wide receiver Sam Graddy with a 14-yard pass to give the Raiders a 
first down at the nine. After Evans threw a four-yard pass to wide receiver 
Jamie Holland, fullback Steve Smith got the touchdown on a five-yard run.

Former USC defensive back Mark Carrier, the Bears' No. 1 draft pick, played 
well in his first start at free safety. Carrier made a big hit on running back 
Kerry Porter to knock a pass loose. . . . Bear defensive tackle William Perry 
suffered a sprained right ankle. . . . The Raiders will finish their exhibition 
season next Saturday when they play the San Diego Chargers at the Coliseum at 1 
p.m.

GOTT'S STREAK ENDS IN PAIN FOR DODGERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER RETIRING 22 CONSECUTIVE BATTERS, RELIEF PITCHER GIVES UP 
MCREYNOLDS' SECOND HOME RUN OF THE GAME AND THE METS WIN, 3-2. 
</P>

Jim Gott, who had retired 22 consecutive batters spanning five appearances, 
made a 400-foot mistake on No. 23 in the ninth-inning Friday, giving up Kevin 
McReynolds' second home run of the game to give the New York Mets a 3-2 victory 
over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
McReynolds' 18th homer, which came on an 0-and-2 pitch, dropped to the Dodgers 
to 6 1/2 games behind the National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds, who 
defeated Pittsburgh 4-3. They also fell into a second-place tie with San 
Francisco, the first time they have shared second place since Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had one last threat in the ninth inning. But after Mike Sharperson 
drew a two-out walk from Dwight Gooden and pinch-runner Juan Samuel advanced to 
third on a bloop single by Mickey Hatcher against reliever John Franco, Rick 
Dempsey grounded to shortstop to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers need for the Reds to stumble in their remaining two games against 
the first-place Pirates. After this weekend, the Reds play only 10 of their 
remaining 36 games against teams with .500-plus winning percentages. When the 
Dodgers finish with the Mets this weekend, they play 15 of their final 35 games 
against winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
Before a sellout crowd of 48,358 at Dodger Stadium, Gott had relieved Ramon 
Martinez to start the eighth with the score tied 2-all, and had retired five 
consecutive hitters before McReynolds, who had homered in the fifth, completed 
his second multi-homer night in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden gave up six hits and struck out 11 while Martinez struck out only five. 
Gooden is 13-1 against the Dodgers in 18 career starters. He has not lost to 
them since May 25, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets had taken a 2-0 lead against Martinez in the top of the fifth inning 
on McReynolds' 17th homer and an RBI single by Dave Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers countered with a run in the bottom of the fifth against Gooden on 
Jose Offerman's grounder after singles by Hubie Brooks and Sharperson. They 
tied it one inning later on Kirk Gibson's hustle. He singled, stole second, 
then stole third and scored when catcher Mackey Sasser hurriedly threw the ball 
into right field. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who entered the night with a season-long two game losing streak, did 
not lose. But he did not break out of his doldrums, either. After throwing a 
hitless three innings, he allowed two runs on six hits in his final four 
innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
He was finally removed from the game for pinch-hitter Stan Javier in the bottom 
of the seventh. Although he leads the major leagues with 188 strikeouts, he has 
struck out just 14 in his last three starts. It is the first time this season 
he has gone three starts without a win. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers blew a good chance to take the lead in the seventh after Mike 
Scioscia led off with a single and Sharperson then bunted safely when catcher 
Sasser delayed on his throw to first base. After Offerman kept runners on first 
and second with a bunt that forced Scioscia at third, the runners advanced to 
second and third on Gooden's fourth wild pitch this season. 
</P>
<P>
But pinch-hitter Javier struck out, then Lenny Harris' line drive landed in the 
web of leaping shortstop Howard Johnson's outstretched glove. That final 
indignity was too much for Manager Tom Lasorda to take, as he threw a catchers' 
mask on to the field in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets touched Martinez on his fifth pitch in the fifth inning, when Kevin 
McReynolds broke an 0-for-19 slump with a home run. The hit, which sailed into 
the Dodger bullpen over the left field fence, was just McReynolds' second 
career hit in nine at-bats against Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
After Kelvin Torve popped up the next pitch, Sasser singled to right field to 
start another scoring opportunity. Gooden's bad bunt was thrown to second base 
by Martinez to force Sasser, but Gooden soon moved to third on a single by 
Daryl Boston. With first baseman Eddie Murray guarding Boston on the bag, 
Magadan grounded a single past Murray and into right field to score Gooden. 
Boston, who moved to third on the play, was stranded when Jefferies struck out 
on three consecutive pitches. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers came back in the bottom of the fifth after Brooks, mired in a 
five-for-35 slump, blooped a single to right. Scioscia's bouncer to Gooden 
moved Brooks to second, a single to shallow right field by Sharperson moved 
Brooks to third, and Offerman's grounder scored him. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers tied it in the sixth on an 150-foot base hit and 270 feet of 
hustle. Both were supplied by Kirk Gibson, who hit a one-out bloop single to 
right field off Gooden. With Kal Daniels batting, two pitches later Gibson 
stole second. Two pitches after that, Gibson stole third and continued his 
sprint around the base and to home plate after an obviously frustrated catcher 
Sasser bounced the ball past Magadan and into left-field foul territory. He 
scored to a standing ovation, which he acknowledged with several pumps of his 
fist. Those were his second and third stolen bases of the game, giving him 20 
stolen bases in 22 attempts this season, second best on the team even though he 
has played in just 63 games. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today's game, which will be broadcast nationally on CBS, will begin at 12:15 
p.m. . . . The starting time for the Sept. 3 game against Houston in Dodger 
Stadium has been moved from 7:05 p.m. to 7:35 p.m. . . . Juan Samuel, who was 
benched for six consecuitive games, should return to the lineup this weekend 
against Sid Fernandez and Frank Viola.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some sportscasters have started calling the Houston baseball team the 'Stros in 
an effort to save time. I feel that they should extend this practice to other 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it takes more time to say Dodgers than 'Gers. Even more time could 
be saved if the practice were extended to city names. We could hear the scores 
of games involving the 'Ork 'Ets and the 'Burgh 'Ates. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, why not use this method with the names of individuals. Think of the 
time that would be saved if we turned on our radios and heard, "Hello 
everybody, this is 'In 'Cully, along with 'Oss 'Orter and 'On 'Dale, bringing 
you tonight's games between the 'Os 'Les 'Gers and the 'Nati 'Eds. On the mound 
for the 'Gers will be 'Do 'Zuela." 
</P>
<P>
Let's use this for the names of various statistics, too. Then 'Oss could 
squeeze in even more 'istics between 'itches.

ROODBERG STORY DIDN'T DESERVE MARATHON SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The worst thing about the Richard Roodberg debacle (Aug. 19) is that The Times 
chose to waste so much space -- two long articles of over 3,000 words -- on 
this guy. 
</P>
<P>
In the space you used, you could have printed the results of every local 
masters track and field meet held this year. That would have been far more 
interesting and informative about what masters running is really like. 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of fascinating, human-interest stories out there about senior 
runners. To focus on Roodberg is an embarrassment to The Times, and an insult 
to genuine over-40 athletes.

<TEXT>
<P>
Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union outlasted the rain and Christo van 
Rensburg of South Africa, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, Friday and moved into the 
quarterfinals of the WCT Tournament of Champions at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The second-round match began Thursday before rain washed out play on the hard 
courts at the West Side Tennis Club. At that time, Chesnokov led, 6-2, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Chesnokov and Van Rensburg took turns posting streaks in between 
frequent showers that interrupted play and sent the final second-round match to 
an indoor court in Bethpage, N.Y., 26 miles from Forest Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In another second-round match, Aaron Krickstein outlasted Petr Korda of 
Czechoslovakia, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the only quarterfinal match completed Friday, Emilio Sanchez of Spain 
defeated Patrick McEnroe, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Henri Leconte of France wasted three match points in his battle against Todd 
Martin of Lansing, Mich., before a heavy mist made the courts too slippery, and 
play was suspended for the night. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe overcame six hours of rain delays to upset third-seeded Brad 
Gilbert, 6-3, 6-2, in the quarterfinals of the $250,000 Hamlet Challenge Cup at 
Commack, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal match, Guy Forget of France, seeded eighth, eliminated 
second-seeded Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 6-7 (7-4), 6-0, 7-5. The second set 
lasted only 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The matches of Stefan Edberg-Jonas Svensson and Pete Sampras-Goran Ivanisevic, 
delayed by the weather, will conclude today. 
</P>
<P>
An ankle injury forced second-seeded Raffaella Reggi of Italy to retire from 
her quarterfinal match with unseeded Mercedes Paz of Argentina in a $225,000 
tournament at Schenectady, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Paz led Reggi, 6-1, 4-0, when the injury occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Another quarterfinal match between Sylvia Hanika of West Germany and Anke Huber 
was shortened by injury when Hanika hurt her elbow and had to retire in the 
third set, which was tied at 2-2. Hanika won the first set, 6-4, but lost the 
second, 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarterfinals of the $160,000 women's tournament at Mahwah, N.J., Leila 
Meskhi of the Soviet Union upset fourth-seeded Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, 
6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Meskhi's ground strokes forced Maleeva to commit numerous errors in the match 
that was forced indoors after being delayed by rain. 
</P>
<P>
Meskhi will face top-seeded Steffi Graf in the semifinals today. Also, 
second-seeded Zina Garrison will third-seeded Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
Rain postponed second-round qualifying for the U.S. Open at New York. It was 
rescheduled for today.

LOOKING FOR A SIGN OF HOPE FROM RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We realize the Raiders did not have a great year last year, but after watching 
all the games that were shown on television, it was clear that Steve Beuerlein 
outplayed Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
I've talked to many football fans, and we are all confused as to why Schroeder 
was signed immediately and Beuerlein still hasn't signed for a smaller amount. 
There is probably some explanation for this and, as a Raider fan, I would 
appreciate knowing.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MARSHALL GIVES RED SOX PENNANT HOPES A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Marshall might be exactly what the Boston Red Sox need for the stretch 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
In only his third game in the American League, Marshall singled home the 
go-ahead run in the ninth inning and the Red Sox beat the Blue Jays, 2-0, 
Friday night at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, in the second game of the four-game series in the Skydome, gave 
the Red Sox a two-game lead over the Blue Jays in the American League East and 
assured they will leave Canada in first place. Even if the Blue Jays win the 
next two, the Red Sox will hold a percentage-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Jay left-hander Jimmy Key went seven innings and did not permit a runner 
to reach second base. The Red Sox's Dana Kieker (5-6), meanwhile, spent much of 
the night working out of jams. But their was no score in the ninth and Duane 
Ward (2-7) was in relief for the Blue Jays, throwing a fastball timed at 96 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs singled to left and with one out Mike Greenwell singled to right, 
Boggs going to third. 
</P>
<P>
The count went to 0-and-2, but Ward apparently tried to sneak a fastball past 
the former Dodger slugger. Marshall lashed it through the drawn-in infield to 
score Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, knowing that Marshall had a back problem, sent three minor 
leaguers to the New York Mets for him and immediately started a rehabilitation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Their patience paid off. He homered in his debut Tuesday and his second hit of 
this game made him four for 12 in the American League with three runs batted in 
in three games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just grateful for the chance to play," Marshall said. "One of the reasons 
for me to going down to rehabilitation was so that when I did get the chance I 
would be ready. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I am ready. I'm just glad to help." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays have failed to hit a home run in seven consecutive games, their 
longest such slump of the season. 
</P>
<P>
An inability to bunt might have been a bigger failure. Greg Myers opened the 
seventh with a double. The Blue Jays have sacrificed only 14 times all season, 
worst in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Lee tried to bunt, sent it right back to Kiecker, who threw out Myers at 
third. Even though Mookie Wilson singled later in the inning, the Blue Jays 
missed their chance to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
With a lead they probably would have brought their bullpen ace, Tom Henke, in 
instead of Ward. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 2, Minnesota 0 -- At Arlington, Tex., the Rangers won the first of the 
three games third baseman Steve Buechele will miss on suspension on a two-run 
double in the seventh inning by Jeff Kunkel. 
</P>
<P>
Buechele drew a three-game suspension for his part in a melee Aug. 17 with the 
Chicago White Sox at Arlington Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buechele charged the mound after being hit by a pitch from Greg Hibbard. A 
melee followed. 
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth defeat in a row for the Twins. Kunkel emerged from a 
one-for-14 slump with his game-winning double. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 1, New York 0 -- Tim Leary (7-16) found another way to lose at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
He made a wild pitch with Bill Spiers on third in the fifth inning and the 
Brewers' shortstop scored the only run. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 11th time this season that the Yankees, who had won six in a row 
before losing to the Brewers Thursday night, have been shut out. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers' Paul Molitor opened the game with a single to extend his hitting 
streak to 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 5, Cleveland 4 -- Cal Ripken Jr. celebrated his 30th birthday with a 
sacrifice fly in the 11th inning at Baltimore. The Orioles are 11-4 in extra 
inning games. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' Gregg Olson failed to hold a lead in the ninth. He gave up a home 
run by Carlos Baerga that made the score 4-4. It was only the second home run 
against Olson and both have cost him saves at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Ripken walked to start the winning rally in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 4, Seattle 3 -- Willie Wilson tied the score with his second home 
run of the season to open the ninth inning at Kansas City and rookie Brian 
McRae's infield hit drove in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive victory for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle relief ace Mike Schooler threw two pitches in the ninth, then left 
after his shoulder stiffened. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like my arm pulled out of its socket," Schooler said. "That's the only 
way I can describe the feeling. I knew something was wrong." DAN HAFNER

Texas Ranger third baseman Steve Buechele was suspended for three days for his

</P>
<P>
Buechele charged the mound, prompting both benches to clear, after he was hit

SUDDENLY, DAVIS CAN SEE ENOUGH TO LEAD REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds have waited all season for Eric Davis, their best hitter, 
to start producing. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it appeared he never would, the team decided to test his eyesight. 
All it took to straighten out Davis was contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
In his third game with his new "batting" aid, Davis went four for four, 
including a home run, and scored all the runs in the Reds' 4-3 victory over the 
Pittsburgh Pirates Friday night at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Davis jumped on Pirate ace Doug Drabek. His 17th home run broke a 2-2 tie in 
the sixth inning. The Pirates pulled even again on Jose Lind's single in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who went into the game batting .188 against the Pirates this season, 
singled with one out in the eighth inning and scored on Paul O'Neill's double 
to left-center. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, swept by Pittsburgh last week in Cincinnati, had lost five in a row 
to the leaders of the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Before the eye test, which may be of considerable significance as the Reds try 
to hold off the rest of the West, Davis, a lifetime .275 hitter, was batting 
only .223. He had hit 15 home runs in 93 games. 
</P>
<P>
With contact lenses, he has hit two home runs in three games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's starting to swing the bat and that's what we need," Manager Lou Piniella 
said of Davis. "He had a big night." 
</P>
<P>
Drabek, who beat the Reds on Sunday, said he pitched Davis the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just seeing the ball better," Davis said. "I was hitting the ball with 
authority Thursday night. I just didn't have anything to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It still makes you feel good, even if the knees aren't well. It's a lot better 
than punching out four times. I feel more comfortable up there. I believe I'm 
ready to help this team win the division." 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up the tying run, Ron Dibble pitched 2 1/3 innings for the 
victory. Randy Myers pitched the last 1 2/3 innings to get his 25th save. He 
struck out the last two batters with Barry Bonds on second. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 13, Philadelphia 2 -- Kevin Mitchell's three-run double 
highlighted an eight-run second inning as the Giants won at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants pounded Phillies' starter Pat Combs (6-9), who had allowed only 
seven earned runs in his previous five starts, for all eight runs in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Williams walked, Gary Carter singled and Robby Thompson walked to load the 
bases. Greg Litton singled to center for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike LaCoss reached safely when Combs fielded his bunt and threw late 
trying to force Thompson at third, re-loading the bases. Brett Butler's 
sacrifice fly scored Thompson and Dave Anderson's infield single scored Litton 
for a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Will Clark's single reloaded the bases, Mitchell's double into the left 
scored all three runners for a 7-0 lead. Williams' RBI single closed out the 
inning as Combs saw his ERA jump from 3.75 to 4.28. 
</P>
<P>
LaCoss (4-2) allowed nine hits in seven innings as he won for the first time 
since April 21. It was his third start after spending 3 1/2 months on the 
disabled list after knee surgery. He walked three and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 3, Chicago 0 -- Steve Avery, a 6-foot-4 left-hander, became the 
youngest Brave to throw a shutout. Avery, 20, gave up six hits, struck out 
eight and walked two at Atlanta to improve his record to 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between this game and my other games is that I had command of 
my pitches," Avery said. "I was trying to move them in and out." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Bobby Cox was ecstatic. "When you have a 20-year-old who changes 
pitches like that, you've got something," Cox said. "He's going to be a lot of 
fun for a lot of years. I wouldn't be surprised if he threw five more shutouts 
in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Maddux (11-11), who is 5-2 lifetime against the Braves, pitched his sixth 
complete game. He became the loser in the first inning when his balk moved 
Oddibe McDowell to second and he scored on Tommy Gregg's single. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 2, Montreal 1 -- Andy Benes was a No. 1 draft selection by the Padres 
in 1988. At that time he had a terrific fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Tendinitis in his right elbow has taken some of the speed. Slowly, though, 
Benes, 23, is learning to win without it. 
</P>
<P>
In winning his third game in a row and improving his record to 10-8, Benes, 
although he struck out only two, gave up three hits in 6 1/3 innings at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, his fastball doesn't have the zip it once had," Manager Greg 
Riddoch said. "He's having to learn to pitch and he's doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Stolen bases by Bip Roberts and Roberto Alomar set up the Padres' two runs off 
Dennis Martinez (10-9). 
</P>
<P>
The Expos scored on Tim Raines' seventh home run in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Houston 2 -- Vince Coleman stole his 72nd base, but his single in 
the 11th inning at Houston gave the Cardinals the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Pagnozzi opened the inning with a single and, when left fielder Mark 
Davidson misplayed the ball, went on to second. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-runner Dave Collins was sacrificed to third and Coleman lined the single 
to beat Dave Smith (4-5). 
</P>
<P>
Coleman has stolen 13 bases in the last nine games. He needs 28 in 37 games to 
reach 100. He has hit safely in nine games in a row. DAN HAFNER

COLLINSWORTH HOPES NO ONE GETS HIS 'SCAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The TV repairman: 
</P>
<P>
Cris Collinsworth thinks he's stumbled upon the secret of life, but he's not 
thinking of cashing in and writing a book about it. Right now, he says he's 
hoping "No one catches onto my scam." 
</P>
<P>
The scam the ex-Cincinnati Bengals pass receiver speaks of is his constantly 
burgeoning broadcasting career, which, according to TV experts, appears 
limitless. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to describe his contribution doing such things as hosting an HBO special 
"Record Breakers of Sports" Monday, Collinsworth drawls, "All I do is show up, 
goof off a little bit and try to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
And it works, as shown by his popular radio talk show in Cincinnati, the pro 
football stuff he'll be doing for NBC this fall, his elevation to center stage 
on HBO's "Inside the NFL" and a few other projects. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Collinsworth and former teammate Boomer Esiason have an 
interest in a restaurant ("We own a toilet and a half"), he's in law school 
("It's my fifth year and they're thinking of giving me tenure") and wife Holly 
presented him with a daughter recently ("As a matter of fact, I'm parenting 
today"). 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't sound much like a guy who spends most of his time looking to avoid 
work. "Actually," Cris quips, "if I knew I was going to have so many fabulous 
things happen to me so quickly, I would have quit playing ball five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The toughest part of my day is reading all the newspapers getting ready for 
the talk show. Fans in Cincinnati figure I know football, so they never give me 
much heat there. But it's a baseball town and everybody knows they probably 
know more about the game than I do. Whenever my wife wants me to do something, 
I say 'Can't, Hon, I'm working here reading the papers.' " 
</P>
<P>
The "Record Breakers" show covers the exploits of Hank Aaron, Roger Bannister, 
Mark Spitz, Bob Beamon, Billie Jean King and others and, according to 
Collinsworth, is a cut above similar shows in that "we'll be giving you the 
person's whole story." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, politics isn't the only thing that breeds strange bedfellows. 
Imagine the squeaky-clean Walt Disney empire getting involved with wild and 
woolly college football. The initial Disneyland Football Classic, with Colorado 
vs. Tennessee, airs on NBC Sunday. Who'da ever thunk it? 
</P>
<P>
CBS will begin shipping about 40 hours of U.S. Open tennis our way with those 
late-evening half-hour wrapups Monday, with 5 1/2 salvos Sept. 1, 2 and 3. 
Beginning Monday, Aug. 27, USA Network has daily shows for five hours during 
the day and for three hours in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Properties and an outfit called Skybox is coming out with a series of 300 
player trading cards (available in November) and the product is sensational. 
So, start saving those nickels, dimes, quarters and dollar bills, Junior. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ferry will be doing the "NBA Insiders" show for NBC come the fall. 
Fortunately, the job won't involve a team sinking or swimming with his talent 
assessments.

SILBERMAN CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chronology of the money-laundering case against Richard T. Silberman: 
</P>
<P>
September, 1986: The FBI began an investigation into the activities of reputed 
mobster Chris Petti of San Diego. The probe, which relied heavily on wiretaps, 
focused on mob interest in gaming operations at the Rincon Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1988: The possibility of an indictment from the probe into Petti's 
interest in the Rincon reservation was becoming increasingly remote. Meanwhile, 
prosecutors said, Silberman called Petti to see if Petti knew anyone interested 
in laundering money. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 9, 1988: At a Mission Valley coffee shop, Petti introduced Silberman to 
Pete Carmassi. Posing as a front man for Colombian drug lords, Carmassi really 
was Peter J. Ahearn, an undercover FBI agent. Ahearn testified that he told 
Silberman that the source of his funds was Colombian drug deals; Silberman 
testified that Carmassi said no such thing. Also at the meeting was government 
informer Robert Benjamin, who first introduced Ahearn to Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 30, 1988: The first of the two deals that formed the basis of the case 
against Silberman got under way in a Los Angeles hotel room when Ahearn 
delivered $100,000 cash, wrapped in a shoe box, to Jack Myers and Darryl 
Nakatsuka. According to trial testimony, Silberman had told Ahearn that the 
code for the delivery that night: "You tell them you're 'Mexico,' and they'll 
tell you they're 'Baja.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 5, 1989: According to Silberman, Benjamin, the government informer, called 
Silberman and threatened Silberman's wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan 
Golding, and their children. Benjamin repeated the threats in another call on 
Feb. 4, Silberman testified. Benjamin testified he made no such threats. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 7, 1989: Silberman and Ahearn met again, to discuss a second deal. It 
evolved into a swap of $200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
April 7, 1989: Silberman was arrested on money-laundering charges moments after 
leaving another San Diego hotel room, where, prosecutors said, he was 
negotiating a third transaction with Ahearn. According to FBI agents, Silberman 
confessed. Silberman was taken to jail, but released on bail the next day. 
</P>
<P>
April 21, 1989: Silberman was named in a grand jury indictment charging him 
with laundering $300,000 that Ahearn had portrayed as the proceeds of Colombian 
drug trafficking. He pleaded not guilty. Also indicted on related charges were 
Petti, Myers and Nakatsuka. Ziegler was added in a subsequent indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 15, 1990: Silberman was seen at Lindbergh Field, purchasing a USAir ticket 
to Los Angeles International Airport, reportedly after having told his family 
he was going to a business meeting in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 17, 1990: Silberman was found unconscious in a Las Vegas hotel room. 
According to Golding, he took an overdose of sleeping pills and tried to kill 
himself, believing he could not get a fair trial before Irving. After being 
discharged Feb. 19 from a Las Vegas hospital, Silberman spent two weeks in a 
San Francisco psychiatric hospital before returning to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
March 9, 1990: Irving ruled that the thousands of wiretaps in the case were 
conducted legally, clearing the way for the use of dozens of secretly recorded 
tapes at Silberman's trial. Many of the taps were instituted under the nation's 
first use of a "roving wiretap," by which FBI agents monitored multiple phones, 
including even public pay phones. 
</P>
<P>
April 10, 1990: Ziegler pleaded guilty to one criminal count of violating 
federal currency laws. 
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1990: Jury selection in Silberman's case began. 
</P>
<P>
May 14, 1990: Myers pleaded guilty to a single count of violating federal 
currency laws and agreed to testify against Silberman. Myers is scheduled to be 
sentenced Sept. 24. The remaining two men, Petti and Nakatsuka, are scheduled 
to stand trial Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
May 16, 1990: Silberman's trial began with opening statements by government 
prosecutor Charles F. Gorder Jr. and defense lawyer James J. Brosnahan. 
Testimony began May 18 and continued through June 13. Silberman testified for 
two days and maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
June 18, 1990: Ziegler was sentenced to six months in custody. 
</P>
<P>
June 19, 1990: The jury in Silberman's case began deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
June 28, 1990: Jurors convicted Silberman of one count of violating a federal 
currency law. Irving immediately sent Silberman to jail, fearing he was a 
flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
June 29, 1990: The jury announced it was deadlocked on several other counts, 
and Irving declared a mistrial. Gorder said prosecutors would seek a second 
trial on the unresolved charges. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 24, 1990: In a plea bargain, Silberman pleaded guilty to one count of 
conspiring to launder cash. Prosecutors agreed to drop the unresolved counts 
and to recommend that Silberman receive a 41- to 51-month prison term. Irving 
set sentencing for Sept. 25. ALAN ABRAHAMSON

AL MARTINEZ: DAYS OF DRUMS AND BUGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's everywhere now. The war talk, I mean. 
</P>
<P>
I hear it around Farmers Market where two old men, like characters in a Bill 
Mauldin cartoon, are saying we ought to go in there and smash hell out of 
Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
"Teach him a lesson he'll never forget," was the way one of them put it. 
</P>
<P>
I hear it in Venice where activist Jerry Rubin is trying to get signatures on 
an anti-war petition. "Nuke the Arabs!" two kids shout. 
</P>
<P>
I hear it in Glendale from a woman flying the American flag who believes the 
longer we wait, the worse it'll get. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," she says, "but we can't let them get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
I hear endless words on radio and television throughout the day, talkin' war 
even when there's nothing new to report, like drummers pounding away long after 
the parade has ended. 
</P>
<P>
Koppel, Brokaw, Rather, Jennings, Gumbel, Shaw, Donaldson . . . and faces of a 
thousand experts in montage, their voices muting to a common riff. 
</P>
<P>
I read it in headlines as black as a night in hell and in ads that hustle a 
commodity always in demand when bombs fall and blood flows: music. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-two Great Love Songs From World War II!" one ad says. "An Unforgettable 
Collection For Sweethearts Everywhere!" 
</P>
<P>
 Buy an album, buy a flag, buy a yellow ribbon . . . buy a tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I sing today of war's cold shadow because, like Roseanne Barr grabbing her 
crotch, it's what everyone is talking about. 
</P>
<P>
What I detect in the voices of those I hear around this sprawling megalopolis 
is a contradiction of concern, bravado and incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened so quickly," a woman said, seated across from me at a dinner 
party. "One day we're cheering peace with the Russians and the next day we're 
sending troops to the desert." 
</P>
<P>
"It's oil," a television writer observed wisely, picking at his lemon chicken. 
"We'll kill for oil." 
</P>
<P>
It's an "Arab Hitler," another said in a tone not meant to tempt debate. "We 
let Adolf get away with taking Poland and look what happened after that." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't say anything. 
</P>
<P>
That's not like me. Give me a couple martinis before dinner and a little wine 
en route and I'll do the dance of the devil's advocate as wildly as a ballerina 
spinning across the table top. 
</P>
<P>
But this time I just listened and remembered. The people there were younger 
than me and, like three blind men trying to describe an elephant, they were 
dealing with something they had never experienced. 
</P>
<P>
War, I mean. 
</P>
<P>
My generation is steeped in the stuff. I grew up in World War II, reached young 
adulthood in time to fight in Korea, matured in the Vietnam War and now slide 
into my cruel middle years during the . . . what? . . . Arab War? 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever seen human blood laced across fresh snow?" I finally said to 
those at the dinner table. "It's like red ribbons on white tissue." No one 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you say that?" my wife asked later. I couldn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you afraid?" I asked a young friend in the Navy. He's stationed aboard the 
missile cruiser Long Beach. It could be with the next carrier group to sail for 
troubled waters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nervous," he said. "You never know what's going to happen. If the Ranger 
goes, we go too. We're part of the task force." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right to be afraid," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid, I'm edgy," he said. He's 19. There's still swagger in his 
tone. "I don't think it will come to the point of shooting." 
</P>
<P>
"Bertolt Brecht said war, like love, will always find a way." 
</P>
<P>
I had meant to cheer him up, not terrify him. The kid didn't even know who 
Brecht was. He was just trying to reassure himself. It won't happen to me . . . 
will it? 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have vision," the wise writer at the dinner party was saying. 
"It's like Korea. No one's going to remember a war in Arabia. But they'll 
remember if we don't stand up to aggression." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the trouble with war up close," I said. "Smoke and pain cloud vision." 
</P>
<P>
Later that night I sat in the middle of my den and dug through a box of 
souvenirs from Korea. A camouflaged helmet cover, a diary, letters . . . and a 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
It's a young man holding an M-1 rifle. There's bravado in his stance, but 
horror in his eyes. I sigh deeply and sit staring at the face in the picture 
for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the smoke, I remember the pain and I hate what's happening. It's 
deja vu. The guy in the picture is me.

COMMUNITY GROUPS TO FIRE UP ANTI-SMOKING DRIVE AT STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At this weekend's San Diego Chargers-San Francisco 49ers football game, a 
coalition of community groups plans to officially kick off its anti-smoking 
campaign by taking a swipe at a popular tobacco industry symbol. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance of more than 30 organizations, known as the Tobacco Control 
Coalition, will display its logo, in fireworks, during a display after the game 
-- directly above a huge stadium sign advertising Marlboro cigarettes, a 
spokesman announced at a press conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"That logo will be displayed right over the top of the Marlboro man," said 
David Burns, the coalition's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first step in a local drive that will encompass a greater scope 
than other anti-smoking movements, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply educating people about the health hazards of smoking, Burns 
said, the groups will attack media images and societal attitudes associated 
with the habit. 
</P>
<P>
Segments of the community will be targeted that statistically are more likely 
to start smoking -- such as children and some ethnic minorities -- or that are 
particularly susceptible to harm from cigarette smoke, such as pregnant women, 
said William Cox, director of the county's Health Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
The "tobacco-free" coalition includes the local chapters of the American Cancer 
Society, American Heart Assn., American Lung Assn. and the county's health and 
education departments. 
</P>
<P>
"Smoking is part of the way we cope with stress," Burns said. "It's part of the 
way that we interact with one another. . . . What will happen is that we will 
go after tobacco on a broad front." 
</P>
<P>
As spectators arrive at Saturday's game, they will receive an anti-smoking 
pledge card and bumper sticker, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's members hope people will sign the pledge cards and turn them in 
at the stadium's gates -- an act that could be the first step toward quitting, 
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, several hundred children who attended anti-smoking educational programs 
in the community will attend the game as guests of the health services 
department, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the anti-smoking campaign, which totals about $8 million, will come 
from state cigarette tax revenues, Cox said.

HUSBAND ARRESTED IN WOMAN'S POISONING DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: VICTIM DIED FIVE DAYS AFTER BEING TAKEN TO HOSPITAL; STRYCHNINE WAS 
DETECTED DURING AUTOPSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 46-year-old San Diego man was booked into County Jail Friday on suspicion of 
killing his wife with strychnine, a poison used to kill rodents. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police arrested John Morency at his home in the 4300 block of 
Caminito de la Escena about 7:30 a.m., said Lt. Dan Berglund, a homicide 
imvestigator. 
</P>
<P>
Morency's 30-year-old wife, Sue, died Aug. 5 at Sharp Memorial Hospital, where 
she had been on a life support system since being rushed to the hospital five 
days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit for search warrants, police learned that Sue Morency 
might have planned to leave her husband. 
</P>
<P>
On July 31, firefighters and paramedics responded to a 911 call about 10:38 
p.m. from the couple's home in the Kensington Park Villas. According to the 
affidavit, Morency called saying his wife was not feeling well and that they 
needed an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
When the dispatcher tried to transfer Morency's call, he hung up without giving 
his name or address. 
</P>
<P>
The fire dispatcher called him back, and this time, the affidavit says, Morency 
told the dispatcher that his wife, who could be heard screaming in the 
background, might be suffering from food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
When an emergency team arrived, Morency told them they were not needed, 
according to the affidavit. When they heard the screams, however, they went in 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"She was obviously in great pain," Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Morency, who was nude, was found convulsing on a bed with her limbs 
twitching and occasionally crying out in pain, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
She then went into cardiac arrest and was taken to the hospital, despite what 
the affidavit calls emphatic requests from her husband that they not take her 
because the two had a trip to Cabo San Lucas planned for the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had difficulty diagnosing her illness, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy by the San Diego County medical examiner's office confirmed that Sue 
Morency died of strychnine poisoning. She had four times the lethal dose in her 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Strychnine once was used as rat poison, but that was stopped because it was too 
dangerous for children who might be in the area. Now its only consumer use is 
as gopher poison, said Dr. Anthony Manoguerra, director of the Poison Center at 
UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In its usual form, strychnine is an odorless crystalline powder with a bitter 
taste that can be dissolved in liquids or mixed in with food. When used to kill 
gophers, for example, the potent poison is mixed in with grain, Manoguerra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The poison causes the muscles to go rigid and into spasms, making it impossible 
for a person to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically you are suffocating because the muscles are so rigid you can't 
expand and contract your lungs," Manoguerra said. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews in the affidavit show that Sue Morency might have thought about 
divorce. The affidavit also notes that Morency told police he had taken out a 
$100,000 life insurance policy on his wife within the past six weeks because 
she had asked him to. 
</P>
<P>
People who know the couple said they have been married for about three years 
and have no children. 
</P>
<P>
John Morency has lived in the complex since about 1984, said Ron Parnes, 
director of the Kensington Park Villas near Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very nice fellow," Parnes said. "He's always been very friendly to the 
neighbors and the people in the complex." 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, interviews showed that the Morencys had a "very 
stormy relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Homicide by poisoning is rare in San Diego County, according to the medical 
examiner's records. In 1989, three carbon-monoxide poisonings were reported; in 
1988, one poisoning was reported; in 1987, there were none.

MELVIN DURSLAG: LIFE, LIMB, WALLET ARE THREATENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MELVIN DURSLAG

<TEXT>
<P>
Rejecting diplomatic solutions, batters who are struck, or nearly struck, by 
pitches they feel have been thrown with suspicious intent have been going to 
the mound with increasing frequency, trying the case at that location. 
</P>
<P>
What begins as a two-man confrontation quickly escalates into combat involving 
people from two dugouts, soon joined by people from two bullpens. 
</P>
<P>
A scene of pastoral tranquility -- children at play on a carpet of green -- 
quickly degenerates into something untidy. 
</P>
<P>
To help you understand the mentality, not to mention the functions, of those 
who participate in mound wars, we offer this special report, submitted with no 
point of view by your impeccable researcher. 
</P>
<P>
Long distinguished for his civility, a nobleman of baseball, Dale Murphy, 
opposes batters' practices of taking their grievances to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Drilled, knocked down and brushed back numberless times, Mr. Murphy has found 
no cause for fighting, a break for those who throw, considering he rises 6 feet 
4 and weighs a hard 215. 
</P>
<P>
"I must make it clear, though," he explains, "that you can't play baseball 
without retaliation. It isn't practical. So how does a team retaliate? I 
believe in nice, clean transactions. The other side drills your batter: Your 
side drills its batter. And the game goes on as if nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
"And that would seem the gentlemanly solution?" Murphy is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only solution," he answers. "Bench-clearing is unsatisfactory for a 
reason anyone can see. Innocent people can be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is asked, "But if a Met pitcher drills Dale Murphy, and a Phillie 
pitcher then drills Darryl Strawberry, is an innocent person not paying?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's ugly," he replies. "But at least it's a team response. And I see it as 
better than an individual's response, such as my going to the mound. Baseball 
is a team game." 
</P>
<P>
When a batsman heads for the mound, what is the function of the catcher, the 
closest defensive player to the aggressor? 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing the catcher would like to do," says the Dodgers' Mike 
Scioscia, "is talk the hitter out of it. The catcher would like to say, 'Now 
look, old boy, let's open dialogue on this issue.' But the hitter isn't in a 
frame of mind to talk. So you follow him toward the mound, wondering how far he 
will go. If it appears he is going all the way, you do your best to restrain 
him." 
</P>
<P>
In that mission, catcher Darren Daulton of the Phillies recently caught up with 
Dwight Gooden, struck by a pitch and heading for the mound. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bud Harrelson, manager of the Mets, Daulton did more than restrain 
Gooden. He tackled him and got in some punches to the face, a clear violation 
of Marquess of Queensberry rules in the eyes of the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Gooden earlier in the game had drilled two Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is a stressful occupation," Scioscia says. "A lot can be going on in 
a player's mind. And a high-and-inside pitch may be all it takes to trigger 
some boiling emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, it triggered some emotions in the perennial 
peacemaker, Scioscia. Pascual Perez threw a fastball that bounced off the bill 
of his helmet, glancing his eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see it as a case for the U.N.," Scioscia recalls. "I went after him." 
</P>
<P>
A warrior of discretion, Perez ran, proving that speed is still a formidable 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
OK, when the battle begins at the mound, what is the posture of the bullpen, 
located maybe 100 yards away? Does the manager telephone, calling up reserves.? 
</P>
<P>
"When we see trouble," says Jay Howell, ace of the Dodger bullpen, "We come in, 
hoping things will be settled by the time we get there. I wouldn't say we cover 
the 100 yards in 9.5. "But we make an appearance because it seems the patriotic 
thing to do. Bullpen people are level-headed. You rarely will see one of us 
dive into a pileup. If you wear glasses, that's a good way to get them broken." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you view batters who go to the mound?" Howell is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Players today seem to demand direct action," he answers. "It was better years 
ago when guys had more patience. They would turn over the case to the pitcher, 
who was the equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to hear pitchers say, 'It took me two years to get that rat, but I got 
him.' Today, it's boom-boom. Guys race out to the mound and throw punches. One 
day, a guy will start a fight, look around and find no one behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Howell's manager, Tom Lasorda, dissuades students of human behavior from trying 
to find out why hitters go to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"Logically," Lasorda says, "there is no reason to start a fight. But who says 
people who start them are logical? A guy who is normal gets drilled and 
suddenly you're looking at a maniac." 
</P>
<P>
"And these people can't be defused?" Lasorda is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're making $2 million a year and you have a vision of that money going 
out the window because you are hit in the face, can you be defused? If you want 
to defuse someone, pick a guy who is making $200 a week." 
</P>
<P>
Since a lot of performers in Lasorda's time as a player earned such sums, they 
rarely charged the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"What did they have to protect?" he asks. "They dusted themselves off and got 
back in the box." 
</P>
<P>
"Would the head-hunter eventually be avenged?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not necessarily. Often Stan Musial or Willie Mays would. This gave the other 
teams more to think about." 
</P>
<P>
Since the catcher is the first line of defense in today's wars at the mound, 
does Nick Leyva, manager of Philadelphia, offer guidelines to this soldier? 
</P>
<P>
"I tell him only one thing," Leyva says. " 'Don't remove your mask.' "

DAVE DISTEL: BERNSTINE IS A NICE PROBLEM FOR HIS COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood could do it. 
</P>
<P>
Makeup could come up with all the different faces, and costuming could provide 
all the different numbers, and production could find all the different camera 
angles. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Rod Bernstine would be all over the field for the Chargers, a one-man 
highlight film. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it only seems as if he is all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, he can only be in one place at a time. Reality is a wet blanket. 
Reality is a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"But," said Ted Tollner, the Chargers' assistant head coach, "it's a dilemma 
that's a good one." 
</P>
<P>
It is a good one because Bernstine is a good one. The idea is to find a way to 
place the football in his possession, be it by pass, handoff or courier. Going 
through a Sunday afternoon without the football in Bernstine's hands is like 
going through a shopping mall without a credit card. You come up empty. 
</P>
<P>
Did you catch this guy's act against the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
On one play, on which he ran 67 yards for a touchdown, he looked like 
RenaldNehemiah going over a pile at the line of scrimmage, and Gale Sayers 
racing through the secondary. On another, from the Ram one-yard-line, he took 
flight from about the four, a la the departed Gary Anderson, and soared into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
You watch this, and you say, "Wait a minute, what's with this guy? He's wearing 
No. 82. Backs don't wear No. 82." 
</P>
<P>
No, not normally. But Bernstine came to the Chargers as a tight end drafted in 
the first round out of Texas A&amp;M. This was in 1987, nearing the end of the 
Kellen Winslow era, and Bernstine was touted as the newest in the line of tight 
ends Winslow made both popular and productive. 
</P>
<P>
What no one realized at the time, though, was that "Winslow-style" was going to 
become passe in the ever-continuing evolution of NFL tight ends. People playing 
the true tight end position, which is to say next to one of the tackles, would 
henceforth be bruising blockers such as the Chargers' Arthur Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, something called the H-back was born. This took a big guy with 
speed and turned him loose from a slot outside the congestion near the middle 
of the line of scrimmage. In truth, this was the position Winslow played all 
along. HE was the first H-back, though no one knew it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine thus played some traditional tight end and some revolutionary H-back 
and some wide receiver as well. What's more, they dabbled with him as a ball 
carrier, though not in the traditional set. He caught some eyes last year, 
however, when he carried 15 times for an average of 9.1 yards a carry before a 
sprained knee cut him off after five games. 
</P>
<P>
When he reported to camp this summer, he was a little bit confused as to what 
he was. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little bit different," he said, "knowing which meetings I should be 
at." 
</P>
<P>
You see, running backs meet with Bobby Jackson, and tight ends meet with Ed 
White, and wide receivers meet with Charlie Joiner. Bernstine was afraid he 
would show up at one and be fined for missing the other two. 
</P>
<P>
"Running back is our No. 1 priority with him," Tollner said. "We move him out 
of the backfield in different personnel groups, but he's proven he can play all 
those spots. He gives us a lot of flexibility in our game plans." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, then, Bernstine is a running back with a strange number, a 
flashback to those grainy black-and-white film clips with Otto Graham wearing 
No. 60. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not pigeonhole the guy too soon."I can line up anywhere but 
quarterback, center, tackle and guard," he said. "Other than the quarterback, I 
have to be the smartest guy on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. He is a little like a diplomat who has to learn five languages 
because he doesn't know where he is going to be posted next. 
</P>
<P>
It would then figure that he has to wheel his playbooks around UCSD's campus in 
a shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
No? 
</P>
<P>
"I only have one playbook," he said, "but it's large."Maybe that was why he 
showed up for lunch on a motor scooter and his teammates all arrived either on 
foot or on bicycles. They should probably give him a golf cart, like some of 
the coaches have. Actually, if he keeps playing like he has, they'll be sending 
a limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opponents must now be concerning themselves with what the Chargers 
do in relation to where Bernstine is doing it. San Francisco won't worry so 
much in tonight's exhibition exercises, but you can bet regular season foes are 
taking note. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, given his druthers, Bernstine knows where he would prefer to be 
aligned. 
</P>
<P>
"I still say tight end," he said, then paused. "Old style." 
</P>
<P>
That Kellen Winslow's style of playing tight end is now "old style" tells you 
how fast time flies in the NFL. Rod Bernstine will likely have to settle for 
being the new-style attacker he has become. There's absolutely nothing wrong 
with a good dilemma.

SHOW'S ON WAY OUT BECAUSE OF HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How like Eric Show, the ultimate antithesis of a team player, to carp and whine 
just as the Padres finally begin coming together as a team. He's angry the 
Padres "don't believe in him" and cites contract issues, Pat Dobson and 
probably Chub Feeney as the reasons for his demotion to the bullpen -- 
disregarding his astronomical 6.25 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is the man who sat and sulked "why me?" as Pete Rose made a 
sports trivia answer. 
</P>
<P>
So Show wants a trade, and even his agent can't find an interested team. The 
reason? A team plot against him in the front office. A pitching coach who has 
turned around the careers of many (ask Mark Davis) who inexplicably hates Show. 
Remember folks, Eric Show is a John Bircher, familiar with seeing conspiracies 
and placing responsibilities and blame for one's fate on others. He has 
forgotten that to be respected as a man requires him to act like one. I won't 
be the only one glad to see him go.

Wang Chih-Chang and Cheng Chang-Ming combined for a one-hitter and Hsieh 
Yi-Chieh drove in seven runs with two home runs as Taiwan trounced West 
Germany, 14-0, Friday in a Little League World Series quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Shippensburg, Pa., defeated Mobile, Ala., 3-1, in the 
completion of a suspended game, and will play Cypress, Calif., in today's other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Wang struck out seven and was pulled after issuing a fourth-inning walk. Cheng 
struck out six of the nine batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Huddleston of West Germany's Ramstein Air Force Base team singled to 
right with one out in the sixth inning to break up the no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Sun-Hua of Taiwan into a semifinal today against Trail, 
British Columbia, which defeated Matamoros, Mexico, 8-3, Tuesday. Rain 
interrupted play each day since. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Bob Shannon struck out 14 and Shippensburg clung to the 3-0 
lead it had taken Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rain also forced postponement of the championship game from today to Sunday 
for the first time.

HARPER ACCENTS FUNDAMENTALS AS HE RUNS TWO PRACTICES FOR HIS CLU FOOTBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Joe Harper put his Cal Lutheran football team through its opening practice 
Friday morning, marking the first time the Kingsmen have begun a season without 
Bob Shoup, who coached them for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
Harper worked his 50-plus-member squad for a little more than two hours and 
brought the team back for more in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis was on fundamentals including, in the morning session, several 
attempts at properly breaking the offensive huddle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a long way away," Harper said. "We're starting from ground zero -- 'This 
is a football.' " 
</P>
<P>
Veterans found the workouts more structured than Shoup's practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way his practices are compared to last year," senior safety Nicko 
Rising said. "We've got more to do." 
</P>
<P>
Harper, however, was less than pleased by his team's intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good enough, not yet," said Harper, who described his players' 
overall conditioning as "very average." 
</P>
<P>
While many members of the team have expressed regret at the way Shoup's 
dismissal was handled, they are nearly unanimous in their approval of Harper, 
who won a Division II championship at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the talk about Coach Shoup there was a lot of negativity about the 
program," said Dana Zupke, a senior co-captain. "We can concentrate on just 
playing football for a definite change." 
</P>
<P>
And Harper can concentrate on coaching football. Not having coached since the 
1985 season at Northern Arizona, he is back on the field for the first time in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most enjoyable thing I've done since I've been here," Harper said.

GRANADA HILLS' KANKE TUNED FOR RUN AT TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a long, long while from May to September, the song says, and for M. K. 
Kanke of Granada Hills it's been a long, long climb to the top of the NASCAR 
Southwest Tour standings. 
</P>
<P>
The season began last spring, and Kanke will be in first place at least until 
the Sept. 1 race at Orange Show Speedway in San Bernardino, the start of the 
tour's traditional stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth-place finish in last Saturday's 100-lap race at Silver State Raceway 
in Carson City, Nev., finally carried Kanke past Doug George of Atwater in the 
points standings. George, who held first place for two months, trails by two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running second in points last year and Dan Press beat us out," Kanke 
said. "This year, we were just hoping to do what we're doing now." 
</P>
<P>
Kanke -- who stands 6-foot-6 -- likes the idea of racing again at Orange Show, 
where he holds the track record. It could prove to be the place to turn a tight 
lead into a comfortable one. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we should be right there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kanke, 28, is a Kennedy High graduate who bought the house next to his 
childhood home. His father, Darrell, is a former driver who offers help from 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
A former dirt-track champion at Ascot Park, Kanke raced early in his career at 
Saugus Speedway in the Street Stock division, experience that should help him 
when the tour comes to Saugus on Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
After that, four more races will round out the tour, which ends Nov. 3 at 
Phoenix International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the winner of the Tour will be the guy in Phoenix who takes the 
checkered flag," he said. 
</P>
<P>
SigAlert: That wild and crazy bang-up in Turn 1 of Lap 1 of last Saturday's 
40-lap Sportsman division race at Saugus not only caused the event to be 
restarted, but damaged more hoods than "West Side Story." 
</P>
<P>
The cars of veteran drivers Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill, Keith Spangler of 
Northridge and Lance Hooper of Palmdale sustained heavy and visible front-end 
damage. Hooper, despite a nose that scraped on the pavement, nearly won before 
settling for second. 
</P>
<P>
No such luck for Gary Sigman of Carson. He was unable to return from the pits 
after sustaining a broken axle in the same crash. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a very common thing," Sigman said. "It was a deal in which the guy 
behind me caught it just right." 
</P>
<P>
When Sigman wheeled his car into the pits for a quick repair job on what he 
thought was just a problem with a left rear tire, his crew jacked the car up 
and found the broken axle. 
</P>
<P>
"When everybody's going like crazy and wants to be as tight as possible, you're 
definitely gonna have some problems," Sigman said. "We all needed to get 
through the corner and whoever hooked up with my tire didn't use too much 
common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Sigman's car has been repaired and will be racing tonight in another 40-lapper. 
</P>
<P>
Add crash: Left to inherit the front of the realigned pack after the restart 
last Saturday were Rod Johnson of Canyon Country and Dave Phipps of Simi 
Valley. For Phipps, the opportunity was especially enticing since because he 
had entered the evening second in the points standings. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity became even more splendid on Lap 12 when Johnson sustained a 
blown engine and retired to the pits. But just seconds after Johnson's 
misfortune, the drain plug fell out of Phipps' transmission, forcing him out of 
the race too. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, that's just . . . that's just an eyelash away," Phipps said later with 
bemused resignation. "I coulda hung on for the win, I think. But . . . what can 
I do? Just keep trying, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Fan favorites: The first annual West Coast Clash at the Ventura County 
Fairgrounds last weekend drew some of the biggest crowds in Ventura Raceway 
history. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, a crowd estimated at 3,180 turned out to see the USAC 
midgets and three-quarter Midgets, a Ventura record. A $15,000 purse lured 40 
midgets and 40 three-quarter midgets -- or about 20 more cars than usually show 
for the three-quarter races. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated crowd of 3,500 turned up Sunday night for the running of the stock 
cars and a demolition derby.

AARON GRYDER MAKES TRIP 'HOME' TO RIDE NO MARKER IN CABRILLO 'CAP

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aaron Gryder spent a good part of Friday in the air. So, what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
The jockey, who recently turned 20, has been a travelin' man in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
When Gryder climbs aboard No Marker in today's $326,300 Cabrillo Handicap, it 
will mean he has ridden in 10 states this year -- California being added to New 
Jersey, New York, Illinois, Washington, Kentucky, Nebraska, Minnesota, Michigan 
and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, this will be the most welcome stop on Gryder's itinerary. The West 
Covina-born rider's family will be present this afternoon, and his professional 
memories of Del Mar are quite pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting's leading apprentice in 1987, a few months before he led everybody 
at Hollywood Park's fall season, Gryder has developed into a solid journeyman. 
</P>
<P>
His numerous excursions have produced several stakes victories, and he was the 
leading rider at Churchill Downs in Louisville during its recent meeting, which 
ended July 2. Currently based at Arlington, near Chicago, he has 15 victories 
there after starting late and being away much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's enjoying himself, Gryder is looking forward to the day when he 
comes to Southern California for good. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no place like home," he said. "I'd like to come back, but I'm not sure 
when. It might be in a couple of years or when I think the time is right. I 
feel like I want to prove to myself, that I can go all over and be successful. 
It's not easy going in unknown. Fortunately, things have gone very well, and 
people have accepted me wherever I've gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Leading the meeting at Churchill Downs helped make people notice me. 
Arlington's the first meeting I've repeated, and it's nice to see that the 
people who gave me mounts last year are anxious for me to ride for them again 
this year. I'm happy. When you're winning, that helps you to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
No Marker has long been a favorite of Gryder's. The 6-year-old roan son of Grey 
Dawn II provided the then 17-year-old jockey with his first stakes victory in 
the 1987 Tell Handicap at Oak Tree. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, No Marker won the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs on 
June 23, then, three weeks later, took the Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap at 
Longacres, near Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Patricia Johnson-trained horse was a distant second to 
Dispersal in the Canterbury Cup in Minnesota. Now, continuing his tour of the 
United States, No Marker will meet a Cabrillo field lacking in quality. 
</P>
<P>
With Criminal Type, Lively One and Quiet American all missing for various 
reasons, the starting co-highweights at 116 pounds are No Marker and Notorious 
Pleasure, who is probably a better horse on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
So, this could be a good spot for Gryder to have a profitable homecoming. But 
his horse ran poorly on this track last year, finishing last in an allowance 
race on Sept. 1 after being fifth of seven entered in a sprint almost a month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really excited when Patty (Johnson) called me and asked me to come out," 
Gryder said. "I haven't seen my family since Christmas, and I'll stay for a 
couple of days before I go back to Arlington Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I've won five races on No Marker. He's a better horse now than he was in 1987 
when I won my first stakes on him. You have to give a lot of credit to Patty 
Johnson the way she's been able to keep him in top form. 
</P>
<P>
"He fires every time. When he was second to Disperal (by six lengths), he ran 
well. Dispersal was just a better horse that day." 
</P>
<P>
After losing his apprentice allowance, Gryder held his own locally for a while, 
but when the situation went sour, he decided to work in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Gryder thinks he might have been too hasty in his decision. "I 
got too antsy and jumped the gun," he said. "I probably made my decision too 
quickly. Maybe I was used to winning more, but I was still riding for 
(trainers) like Charlie (Whittingham), Craig Lewis and Eddie Gregson, and when 
you ride for people like that you know it's going to turn around." 
</P>
<P>
After spending several months in the Bay Area, Gryder hooked up with agent 
Harry Hacek and they made their way to the Midwest, but both stay on top of 
what's happening in California. "I'm still keeping in touch with everybody and 
I still have some clients," Gryder said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides No Marker and Notorious Pleasure, eight other older horses were entered 
in the Cabrillo, at 1 1/8 miles on the main track. 
</P>
<P>
The other scheduled starters are Charlatan III, who won the Orange County 
Handicap at Los Alamitos a week ago; Double Quick, fourth in the same race 
after battling on the pace; Royal Reach, who has six career victories, five on 
the turf; Silver Circus; Rogue's Realm; Lowell; Miserden, and Bosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
This field would have seemed to be easy pickings for Quiet American, who upset 
Bayakoa in the San Diego Handicap three weeks ago. However, trainer Gary Jones 
decided to wait for Belmont's Woodward Stakes and a match with Criminal Type. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen 3-year-old fillies were entered Friday in Sunday's $167,900 Del Mar 
Oaks. Included in the field for the 1 1/8-mile grass race are Nijinsky's Lover, 
Orlanova, Slew of Pearls, and foreigners Adorable Emilie, Native Twine and As 
If. . . . Del Mar will simulcast the $250,000 Longacres Mile Sunday. The stake 
will be shown between the sixth and seventh races locally. Among the 
participants are Annual Date, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens; Abergwaun 
Lad, with Robbie Davis; and T.V. Screen, with Vann Belvoir. . . . Gorgeous, who 
has been idle since winning the Bayakoa-less Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park, 
will make her next start in Belmont's Ruffian Handicap on Sept. 22.

CHUNG'S 'AGGRESSIVE' BID TO BE A MOM

<TEXT>
<P>
It certainly takes a lot of chutzpah for Chung to announce to the world that 
she and her husband are going to take a "very aggressive approach" to 
conceiving a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Pity any baby she may have; the child probably will have to make an appointment 
to see her between "prime time" and "specials."

'HULL HIGH' SLURS

<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, I get it! "Hull High" is the first major result of the television networks' 
recent commitment to improve the quality of U.S. public education by 
encouraging teen-agers to take learning more seriously, right? I am sure that 
with this stimulus and these role models, American students will have no 
trouble affirming their lofty status on the world educational scale -- 
somewhere below Bangladesh.

FACES . . . : DAVID: A SHAKESPEAREAN 'AT WORK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAUREN LIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith David doesn't seem like the kind of actor who gets nervous before a big 
debut. In fact, when he discusses his most recent film roles -- in "Men at 
Work," which premiered Friday, and in the upcoming "Screwface" -- he exudes the 
steady confidence one might expect from a Julliard-trained actor who stands 
six-foot-two. 
</P>
<P>
He looks like a guy who has never had the butterflies in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not unless you count this thing he has coming up in September. Talk about 
his impending marriage, and David's got a case of the flutters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most exciting thing that's happened to me," he says, with just a 
touch of nerves. "Being in a good relationship does wonders for your life. My 
fiancee and I began to date in the summer of '89, and I swear, since that time, 
life has been much better." 
</P>
<P>
Not that David's life sounds like it's ever been bad. An award-winning 
Shakespearean actor, he's enjoyed a string of enviable roles both on and off 
Broadway, including Macbeth, Othello, Oberon and Aaron the Moor. His film work 
includes co-starring roles in "Platoon," "Bird" and "Always." 
</P>
<P>
David believes he -- like all black actors -- has a responsibility to choose 
his roles carefully. "Those roles that get offered to us only perpetuate the 
'white majority' understanding of who we are," he says -- meaning he shies away 
from pimp and drug-dealer parts. "If we had the opportunity to be more diverse 
in the roles we choose, then those stereotypical roles would become less 
stereotypical," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of mixtures in the world. I look forward to the time when 
we can acknowledge our differences -- but celebrate our similarities." LAUREN 
LIPTON

FACES . . . : CHAPPELL'S NEXT VEHICLE OFF-ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SUSAN KING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some actresses get their act together and take it on the road. Kandis Chappell 
has been acting on the road, and now she's content to be home. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Chappell has been involved in "Rumors," Neil Simon's 
comedy hit currently at the Ahmanson at the Doolittle through Sept. 23. In the 
knock-down, drag-out farce, Chappell steals the show as Chris Gorman, a 
neurotic chain smoker who arrives with her husband at a party only to discover 
their friend has shot himself in the earlobe and his wife has disappeared. The 
national tour has taken her to more than 13 cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We did five weeks in Washington, D.C.," says Chappell. "But usually we did a 
week at a time. It was exhausting. The play is exhausting. I found it 
physically wearing. The bus-and-truck tour going out now does five weeks of 
one-night stands. I would be hospitalized if I did that." 
</P>
<P>
But touring did have its plus side. "It was a great chance to see places I 
hadn't seen before," says Chappell. "After the show, a lot of actors sit around 
and socialize. I would go home and go to bed and get up in the morning and play 
tourist." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Chappell has concentrated on a life in the theater. An associate 
artist at San Diego's Old Globe, she has worked with repertory companies 
throughout the United States. She made her L.A. stage debut three years ago in 
the Pasadena Playhouse production of "Breaking the Silence" and received the 
1988 L.A. Drama Critics Circle Award for her performance in South Coast 
Repertory's production of "The Crucible." 
</P>
<P>
Chappell feels confident enough now to try her luck at film and television. "I 
don't know how long I will last here (in L.A.)," she says. "I don't even 
audition well in the theater. I am not good with rejection. In New York, I went 
out on commercial auditions and after three I said to my agent, 'Don't send me 
on those. I can't do it.' It's taken me years to build up my career, and 
suddenly to start back at square one where you walk in a room and they have no 
idea who you are and they don't care. I can't do that to myself." SUSAN KING

MOVIES AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Aug. 17 a very positive production of "An Old Fashioned Night at the Movies" 
was staged at the Hollywood Bowl. It was obviously fun for the sellout crowd to 
share in the movie-and-live-show concept. 
</P>
<P>
I feel forced to address the mean-spirited, "bah, humbug" attitude of Kevin 
Thomas' review. 
</P>
<P>
He dismisses the need for any live entertainment, and particularly zings the 
Doc Severinsen Tonight Show Band. Our band sounded particularly good that night 
and was anything but "off form," as suggested by Scrooge Thomas. His obvious 
annoyance at the rather long program clogged his ear and his judgment canals. 
</P>
<P>
We hope there will be more shows like it, and if Thomas stays away from musical 
critiques, I promise not to write any movie reviews.

SEATTLE ORCHESTRA IN HOLLYWOOD BOWL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in the eighth week of a 69th summer season, new things can happen at 
Hollywood Bowl. Thursday, the new things were a major American orchestra making 
its Bowl debut, the return to Cahuenga Pass -- after eight years -- of Gerard 
Schwarz and the first Bowl audition of Howard Hanson's Sixth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Not to waffle, one must say immediately that all three elements in this 
superior performance, given before an audience counted at 10,961, lived up to 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
In the outdoor setting of the Bowl, the Seattle orchestra's sound, encountered 
in recent history only in two concerts at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in January, 1988, seems as warm, rich and cohesive as at that earlier 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, from this accomplished band of musicians, virtuoso abilities do not 
produce stridency or overplaying. Instead, strong ensemble values, mellow 
brilliance and effortless balances prevail most of the time. Throughout the 
program -- listing, besides the Hanson work, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 
and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony -- the orchestra made authoritative sounds, 
delivered stylish details and generated enthusiastic performances. 
</P>
<P>
Most enthusiastic, perhaps, was the brash, none-too-subtle reading of the piano 
concerto, in which Alexander Toradze was the soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Bearlike in his approach, Toradze played the familiar work with an 
irrepressible appreciation of its aggressive qualities, with some recurring 
nods in the direction of its lyric elements. But nuances of pianistic color -- 
which some great specialists have brought to this work -- are not Toradze's 
forte; his strong suit is excitement, a quality in which this performance, 
seconded handily by the orchestra, excelled. 
</P>
<P>
If not highly individual, Schwarz's account of Beethoven's Fifth delivered the 
work's dynamism and contrasts convincingly. Where some conductors treat the 
outer movements as do-or-die affairs, Schwarz gave them their dramatic due 
within Classical restraints. And one could luxuriate in his long-lined, 
well-spoken reading of the Andante con moto. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson's neglected penultimate symphony, a product of 1967, is a handsome 
artifact of many charms and no novelty. In harmony and style, it might have 
been written 25 years before it was; indeed, a quarter-century earlier, it 
might have served as a particularly successful score in tandem with an 
appropriate, short film. The Seattle ensemble, coached effectively by Schwarz,

JAZZ TAP IN WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH ZIMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jazz Tap Ensemble offers an utterly contemporary program on the club-like 
stage at the Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's opening, three new works graced an evening of old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
In "Tribute," the dancers re-create the style and steps of film stars, 
capturing the mood and allowing rare close-up glimpses of the demanding 
choreography. A startling novelty is the group's valentine to the Condos 
Brothers: Mark Mendonca and Sam Weber, bare-chested and in feather headdresses, 
offering an "Indian Dance." 
</P>
<P>
Weber, known for balletic lightness, here demonstrates that he can also handle 
the lower registers of tap-dancing. He and Mendonca pace the opening number, a 
new and presumably improvised set of riffs to Dave Brubeck's "In Your Own Sweet 
Way." The music, favorite jazz standards executed affectionately by Stacy 
Rowles on trumpet and growly vocals, Jerry Kalaf on drums, Jeff Colella on 
piano and David Enos on bass, provides familiar ground on which the dancers 
build new tap edifices. 
</P>
<P>
Tap master Eddie Brown, a guest of the ensemble who has been in this business 
since the '30s, was his usual spry and charming self, but the inventive energy 
of the evening was all in the work of Weber, Mendonca and artistic director 
Lynn Dally, a good sign in a genre often top-heavy with nostalgia. "Rap Tune," 
created by Kalaf and Weber, is a remarkable rap-without-words that captures 
exactly the infectious cadence of the burgeoning genre. 
</P>
<P>
Dally looks better than ever; her posture has improved, and her obvious 
pleasure in her work contagious. No bimbos and chorus boys here, only mature 
artists -- even 21-year-old Mendonca, dark and brooding, who dances with 
suppressed power. If he can talk, he's got a future in the movies.

KIDBEAT: 'LATE BREAKING MUSE' COVERS THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anything created by a member of the Mums, the juggling troupe with jugular vein 
humor, promises to be a little different. 
</P>
<P>
"Late Breaking Muse," an ecologically-themed pastiche by the Mums' Nathan 
Stein, staged for free outdoors in Santa Monica's Ocean Beach Park, doesn't 
completely hang together, but its more inspired moments are diverting. 
</P>
<P>
There's a story of sorts, a loosely woven backdrop for bits of 
magic,club-torch-and-fish-juggling, slapstick and satiric soliloquies. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for a job on the Atlantis-bound S.S. Oteric are Noah (Stein), a 
recovering juggler who can't seem to meet girls; J.J. Sparks (Jan Munroe), an 
inventor with a shaky ego; and T. Ray Nickel (Bill Frenzer), a crude 
entrepreneur looking for crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
They're recruited by Elaine Fatale (A. Lorre), a ditzy Atlantis inhabitant, who 
is tired of all the oil spills at sea. "You think it's easy trying to 
photosynthesize under a greasy layer of shmutz?" 
</P>
<P>
She gives each a task to prove himself most worthy -- a device for solo sight 
gags, puns and satire. It's also an excuse for Stein to work a little magic 
with shredded newspaper, scarves and a bird and to juggle sundry items. 
</P>
<P>
Doomed to wear an oil-soaked bird around his neck for his polluting sins, 
Frenzer's Nickel captivates through sheer outrageousness. He works for 
Accidental Oil, hails from Ft. Worthless, Tex., and if there's oil in Atlantis, 
it's his "God-given right to exploit it." 
</P>
<P>
But he won't get that chance in Atlantis, a place where advertising companies 
put "poetry on soap bubbles" and "Medflies guard all living things against 
helicopters." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the message is that we're all in the same boat -- the good ship 
Earth -- and it's time to change our destination. 
</P>
<P>
As the audience lounges on spiky, close-cropped grass -- with surf splashing in 
the background, sea gulls circling overhead and bikers and skaters wheeling by 
-- the message seems especially apt. Tightening and trimming would help sail it 
home.

ERLY Industries Inc.: The Los Angeles food processing firm said first-quarter 
net income rose 820% to $1.2 million, while revenue dipped 8% to $108 million. 
The firm attributed the gain to an increase in juice and rice shipments. 
</P>
<P>
It noted that results were particularly encouraging in light of the fact that 
shipments to Iraq were 27% of its total rice shipments, compared to 48% a year 
ago. In March, it anticipated that, because of the uncertainty of future 
government funding for rice sales to Iraq, it would diversify sales to other 
export markets. "We continue to be confident that if rice shipments to Iraq are 
prohibited, we will be able to replace that market with other export markets," 
the firm said.

CRITIC'S LED ZEPPELIN SONG REMAINS THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to a recent article about Robert Plant ("Down to 
Earth -- Singer Robert Plant's Post-Zeppelin Career Isn't So Full of Hot Air," 
by Mike Boehm, Aug. 9, 1990, OC LIVE!). 
</P>
<P>
First of all, there has never been a band in contemporary pop music as 
misunderstood as Led Zeppelin. The comment that you made in the article -- 
about Led Zeppelin putting "sensation first and plain old sense a distant 
second, maybe ninth or tenth" -- epitomizes the total lack of understanding 
that much of the media has never overcome in regards to the band and their 
music. On the contrary, Led Zeppelin is one of the few bands that had managed 
to keep sensation out of their music while pushing ahead with their own 
capabilities, both individually and collectively, within the framework of a 
single working unit. As a unit, Led Zeppelin reached heights most only dream 
of, but the important thing is that they did it without compromising any of 
their musical integrity or vision. As a result, their music had a certain 
unconventional edge that was unique to themselves. However, it did not cause 
any of their songs to make less "sense" as you had indicated. The truth is 
that, whether acoustic or electric, Zeppelin employed a wide range of sounds to 
give their songs substance, depth and meaning (characteristics that many of 
today's bands urgently need.) 
</P>
<P>
As far as describing "the band's method" as you did, Led Zeppelin had no 
method. To them, having a method was un-rock 'n' roll. For rock 'n' roll in its 
purest sense is energetic, spontaneous and unpredictable. During the '70s, when 
the band was in its prime, one of the members remarked about the release of 
their forthcoming record, "People aren't going to get what they expect." 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Jimmy Page once described Led Zeppelin as "street music, rock 'n' 
roll." I, for one, know it's dangerous for rock's own survival to elevate this 
or any other kind of "street music" onto pedestals too high, but within the 
realm of rock 'n' roll, there's room for the recognition of bands that have 
made a contribution and a difference. Led Zeppelin is one of those bands and 
they deserve the respect as such. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to thank you for not outright associating the band with the term 
"heavy metal," although I believe the subtle message was there. It is 
imperative that Zeppelin be free from the chains of that misnomer. It is my 
hope that the next time you (mention) the band Led Zeppelin in an article that 
you would do so from a fresh perspective because the current one is old, worn 
and detrimentally untrue.

SOUTH AFRICA ACTS TO QUELL TRIBAL FEUD 
</P>

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government declared a state of emergency in 27 black townships Friday, 
giving the police broad powers to detain residents, break up gatherings and 
search without warrants in an effort to end factional fighting among blacks 
that has taken more than 500 lives in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, called the action 
"totally useless" and said it amounted to a partial reimposition of the 
national emergency that the government lifted in three of the country's four 
provinces in June. 
</P>
<P>
"I totally disagree that these measures are necessary," Mandela said. He 
criticized the government for not consulting the ANC but added that peace 
negotiations with the government would continue. 
</P>
<P>
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, in imposing the strict measures, said that 
"the normal laws of the country are no longer sufficient" to quell the 
violence, which pits Zulu supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi 
against non-Zulu ANC sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Vlok also invoked a law that allows the police to disarm township residents of 
33 specific weapons, including spears, pitchforks, screwdrivers, hammers, 
crossbows and bricks. And he announced that the number of police officers, 
backed by army units, would be "drastically increased" in the affected 
townships, among them Soweto, the country's largest. 
</P>
<P>
The police have been sharply criticized by the ANC, which contends that the 
authorities are aiding Zulu warriors. The police deny this. 
</P>
<P>
"People will now realize the government is serious about ending the violence," 
Vlok said, adding that he will "not hesitate to institute stricter measures" if 
the trouble continues. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk told supporters of his National Party that the 
emergency powers were intended as a short-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
"We dare not allow radicals to send this country up in flames," De Klerk said 
in a televised question-and-answer session sponsored by his party. "We will try 
with every means at our disposal to impartially impose law and order." 
</P>
<P>
John Dugard, a civil rights legal expert in Johannesburg, said he did not look 
on the extra measures as a step backward for the country's peace process. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has been under pressure, and this is their way of saying 
they're going to do something," Dugard said. "They don't need these extra 
powers, but they have just seemed unwilling to disarm people." 
</P>
<P>
Vlok's designation of the 27 townships as "unrest areas" and his granting of 
police emergency powers to suspend civil rights come under a 1986 provision of 
the little-used Public Safety Act of 1953. Vlok said the special powers would 
apply for three months but could be extended. 
</P>
<P>
The order gives the police in unrest areas authority to forcibly disperse 
groups, detain people without trial for up to three months, search without a 
warrant, shut down businesses, take over essential services, impose curfews and 
prevent media access to conflict areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tolerate this killing of innocent people," Vlok told a news 
conference in Pretoria. "We intend to really do our level best to remove those 
people who are responsible for the violence." 
</P>
<P>
Vlok acknowledged that the new measures "could be harmful to the image of the 
country." But, he added, "It is in the interest of South Africa and all its 
inhabitants that further bloodshed, disorder and chaos be prevented at all 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela and De Klerk met for 40 minutes to discuss "certain 
practical aspects" of ANC-government agreements, according to De Klerk's 
office. Under those accords, the ANC has agreed to suspend its guerrilla war 
against Pretoria, and the government has promised to begin freeing political 
prisoners and granting immunity from prosecution to returning exiles. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said there was no time during the meeting to raise his objections to 
the new emergency decree. The ANC deputy president is to depart today for a 
weeklong trip to Norway, Libya and Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
The current round of fighting began on Aug. 13 in Tokoza township southeast of 
Johannesburg and quickly spread to Soweto and other area townships. Most of the 
clashes have been between migrant Zulus living in large, crowded hostels and 
township residents, many of whom are Xhosas. Mandela is a Xhosa, and much of 
the ANC's leadership is made up of Xhosas. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha are trying to get top-level talks started in an 
effort to end the violence, and each has issued a call for peace. But Mandela 
has rejected Buthelezi's requests for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say the fighting is an outgrowth of ANC-Inkatha clashes 
among Zulus in Natal province, Buthelezi's home base, where nearly 4,000 blacks 
have been killed in factional fighting since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC contends that Inkatha supporters initiated the Johannesburg-area 
violence in frustration over the ANC's growing role in talks with the 
government. But government officials say the source of the conflict is the 
historical tribal rivalry between Zulus and Xhosas. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk lifted the 4-year-old national state of emergency on June 8 but left 
it in place in Natal. The ANC has demanded the total lifting of the emergency 
decree as a condition for formal negotiations on a new constitution.

IRAQ STANDOFF EXPOSES GAP IN U.S. INTELLIGENCE FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: A LACK OF SPIES ON THE GROUND CREATES A DANGEROUS BLIND SPOT 
REGARDING HUSSEIN'S INTENTIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the standoff in the Middle East reaches a tense new high point, 
Administration officials and intelligence analysts are focusing their thoughts 
and resources on one urgent question: What will Saddam Hussein do next? 
</P>
<P>
As it struggles for answers, the Bush Administration is relying heavily on U.S. 
spy satellites and a fleet of reconnaissance planes to peer into Iraq on 
top-secret missions, snapping photographs and scanning electronic transmissions 
for sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence experts warn, however, that a vital complement -- spies on the 
ground to relay close-up observations -- remains missing from American 
capacities, leaving the United States with a potentially dangerous blind spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to rely on technology and gadgetry," said Ray S. Cline, a former 
deputy CIA director. "The real problem is looking into the hearts and minds of 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
In crises like the current one, he added, "We always start too late." 
</P>
<P>
The intelligence gap is a hangover from an overnight shift in focus for the 
United States, away from traditional Communist adversaries and toward one it 
previously had found little need to penetrate. It is also a product of Iraq's 
closed society and intense secrecy, which allow little room for what one 
official called "paleface spies" to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Hamstrung, U.S. policy-makers and Pentagon planners are hoping that hints of 
Hussein's intentions will be telegraphed in movements they can hear or see from 
afar -- the movements of tanks, the angle of missiles, the burst of sensitive 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
In comments this week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. 
Powell, expressed confidence that U.S. intelligence would be "adequate." He 
said the United States had "an extremely good picture of what the situation 
looks like on the ground north of the Kuwaiti-Saudi border." 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, a high-ranking military source disclosed that intelligence 
reports had allowed Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. Central 
Command, to warn the Joint Chiefs of the impending Iraqi invasion about six 
days before it occurred. Schwarzkopf was able to accurately predict both the 
timing and magnitude of the assault, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Other military experts agreed that satellites and spy planes would probably 
give ample warning of a conventional Iraqi military attack, even if 
surface-to-surface Scud missiles were the weapon chosen. About 12 to 24 hours' 
warning of a military action could be expected, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But they expressed concern that the lack of on-the-ground insight leaves the 
United States vulnerable to less visible developments, including planning for 
possible terrorist attacks. Even more pressing, warned John Pike, an expert on 
high-tech espionage: "All that hardware in space is not going to do much good 
in keeping track of American hostages." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials refused to provide details about the "sources and 
methods" used by the the United States in the current crisis. "If there's ever 
a time when you need to hold it under wraps, it's now," warned Lt. Gen. William 
C. Odom, a former director of the National Security Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable experts outside government said, however, that the array of 
hardware now devoted to the Middle East crisis includes advanced satellites and 
planes capable of tracking virtually any movement or broadcast in Iraq and 
occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Magnum satellite, which intercepts electronic signals from its 
fixed position 22,000 miles over the Mideast, apparently is doing nothing but 
monitoring Iraqi developments 24 hours a day, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, at least four Keyhole photo reconnaissance satellites were 
understood to be making frequent passes over the region to survey the landscape 
with cameras capable of reading a license plate from an altitude of 200 to 500 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to land, sophisticated eavesdropping aircraft known as RC-135 Rivet 
Joints are making frequent forays along the Kuwaiti border, experts said, while 
high-flying TR-1s and more conventional F-4s peer hundreds of miles into Iraq 
from Saudi airspace. 
</P>
<P>
Although cloud cover in much of the world can thwart such monitoring, the 
experts said the constant desert sunshine is an intelligence planner's dream. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing about the Middle East is that you don't have to worry about 
clouds," said Michael Dunn, a private consultant who runs International 
Estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Images gathered by the planes and satellites are almost instantaneously relayed 
to the National Photographic Interpretation Center in Washington, where they 
are examined by Navy analysts armed with a "watch list" of sites at which small 
variations could mean big things. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most closely evaluated indicators of possible Iraqi intentions, the 
experts said, are Scud missile batteries, where a change in the angle of a 
missile could betray preparations for launch, and the deployment of forces 
along national frontiers, who might move from entrenched positions to more 
mobile ones. 
</P>
<P>
If one of the indicators, updated every few hours by a new satellite flyover, 
sets off analysts' alarms, "a copy could be on the President's desk within an 
hour after the picture was taken," said Pike, head of policy for the 
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The electronic signals, gathered by Magnum and Vortex satellites from radio 
broadcasts, radar operations and walkie-talkie transmissions, are similarly 
relayed to Washington for analysis. With computers at the National Security 
Agency in Ft. Meade, Md., homing in on key frequencies, the intercepts can 
provide clues about the locations of Hussein and his key deputies, the experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts wearing headphones in the roving RC-135s, flying 
along the Kuwaiti border, are believed to have developed in the last two weeks 
what one source called an "electronic order of battle" by mapping and 
intercepting most Iraqi military communications. 
</P>
<P>
As tensions mount, the effort has enabled the airborne analysts to monitor 
crucial command facilities to detect any increase in military activities. In 
the event of war, it could guide an electronic jamming campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But the experts warned that the U.S. interception capability in Iraq is 
probably limited to communications that are broadcast in the atmosphere. 
Without help on the ground, telephone conversations and private discussions 
within a single room remain out of reach of American analysts. 
</P>
<P>
And without confirmation from human sources -- which intelligence analysts have 
always regarded as the most accurate -- even the powerful "eyes in the sky" 
sometimes leave analysts wondering. 
</P>
<P>
A government source said the United States was left frustrated earlier last 
week, as Iraqi forces withdrew from the Iranian border, by its inability to 
discover what had happened to a particular elite unit. "We lost them for a few 
days," the source acknowledged.

In an attempt to compensate for its deficiencies in Iraq, the United States is 
believed to be relying largely on friendly intelligence agencies, particularly 
the Israeli Mossad, which is reported to have had considerable success in 
penetrating the country. 
</P>
<P>
While better than nothing, such dependence is regarded by analysts as 
dangerous, in part because of the potential for political bias or manipulation.

The United States won grudging Soviet consent Friday to a U.N. resolution 
backing military enforcement of the embargo against Iraq, clearing the way for 
expected Security Council approval of the measure at a late-night meeting that 
continued early today. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet official said his government reluctantly agreed to the use of force 
against ships suspected of carrying goods to or from Iraq, in exchange for a 
provision emphasizing the need for diplomacy to resolve the Persian Gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't exclude in some minimum form that the enforcement measures could be 
used, but only in the framework of continued diplomatic and political efforts," 
Deputy Soviet Ambassador Valentin V. Lozinsky told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"There are changes in the text that go in this direction," he said following a 
climactic round of talks in which the deal was sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the Soviet Union began moderating its position after Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III spoke by telephone with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Friday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev publicly warned Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein that failure to comply with previous U.N. resolutions 
arising from the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait "will inevitably compel the Security 
Council to adopt corresponding extra measures." 
</P>
<P>
The warning was seen by diplomats here as a means of enabling the Soviet Union 
to drop its weeklong resistance to the proposed U.N. enforcement resolution. 
Soviet officials had been arguing that the resolution was premature because 
"diplomatic and political efforts have not been exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
Lozinsky was asked if Soviet support of the resolution was connected to 
Gorbachev's message to Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, exactly," he said. "This is part of the political and diplomatic efforts 
that are taken by our government in order to solve this crisis by peaceful 
means." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement represents a major victory in President Bush's drive to put an 
international stamp on aggressive U.S. efforts to enforce the U.N. trade 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has insisted that the United States already has legal authority to 
interdict cargo vessels, and U.S. warships have fired shots across the bows of 
two tankers hauling oil from Iraq. But the Administration has fought vigorously 
for the U.N.'s blessing to avoid being portrayed as a lone enforcer of the 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution would permit military commanders of the United States or any 
other nation to take unilateral action against commercial vessels to enforce 
the previously approved U.N. sanctions barring any form of trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, warships could use "such measures commensurate to the specific 
circumstances as may be necessary . . . to halt all inward and outward maritime 
shipping in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destination." 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the negotiations rejected a Soviet bid to place control of the 
enforcement actions under a U.N. military committee. The resolution instead 
merely requests that nations "coordinate their actions . . . using, as 
appropriate, mechanisms of" the U.N. committee. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the lesser powers on the Security Council pressed for tighter U.N. 
control, demanding that the U.N. secretary general and the Security Council 
have "active participation" in enforcement actions. This change, proposed by 
Cuba, Yemen, Zaire and others, was being discussed with U.S. officials at a 
late hour. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the resolution was reached after five days of intensive talks 
involving the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- the 
five permanent members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and France strongly supported the U.S.-sponsored measure. China opposed 
it as an unwarranted intervention in a regional matter but said it would 
abstain from voting. The Soviets held out the threat of vetoing the resolution, 
protesting that any action should await further diplomatic efforts and clear 
evidence that the embargo is being violated. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has never before approved an enforcement measure in the wake 
of economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, the Security Council called upon Britain to prevent, by force if 
necessary, the delivery of oil to Rhodesia. But that was a prelude to 
imposition of a trade embargo eight months later. 
</P>
<P>
In its only other authorization of military force, the United Nations in 1950 
approved an operation, organized by the United States, to counter the invasion 
of South Korea.

THE TIMES POLL;

FEINSTEIN LOSES GENDER EDGE OVER WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Dianne Feinstein no longer is getting "the women's vote" as she and 
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson head into the fall election campaign running dead 
even in their muddy race for governor, the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates' standings have shifted little during the summer, according to 
Times Poll interviews, but the complexion of the race has changed dramatically: 
Feinstein has lost her once-substantial edge among women and Wilson no longer 
has an advantage among men. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the excitement of Feinstein's candidacy for women -- especially 
women in the San Francisco Bay Area -- has cooled significantly, the survey 
indicated. Meanwhile, she has improved her standing slightly among men, 
particularly in Southern California. The result is that both women and men are 
dividing their votes about equally between the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
For voters, the defining difference between Feinstein and Wilson at present is 
not gender or any specific issue, but simply the candidates' party membership, 
the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide survey of registered voters found Feinstein and Wilson tied with 
39% apiece. "Others candidates" were preferred by 2%, and 20% of those surveyed 
were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Given a margin of error of 3 percentage points in either direction, these 
standings represent no significant change from a similar Times Poll survey in 
mid-June, which showed Feinstein at 40% and Wilson at 37%. 
</P>
<P>
In June, however, Feinstein had a 12-point lead among women and trailed by 9 
points among men. In the latest survey, she is up by only 1 point among women 
and down by 2 points among men -- in each case a statistical tie. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrill is gone," observed Times political analyst William Schneider. "In 
June, when Dianne Feinstein became the first woman ever to be nominated for 
governor in California, there was a real sense of excitement about her among 
women. In order to win in November, she's going to have to get that back." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider added, "Her primary election victory also may have exaggerated the 
gender gap between men and women voters. Now, it looks like things are 
returning to normal." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll conducted telephone interviews with 1,586 registered voters over 
six days ending Wednesday night. The survey was supervised by Susan Pinkus, 
assistant Times Poll director. 
</P>
<P>
The poll's results seemed to reflect the mudslinging of each side in recent 
weeks, as the candidates pummeled each other with negative television 
commercials and harsh rhetoric. The sniping and bickering took its toll. The 
voters' impressions of both candidates dropped during the summer, and 
Feinstein's popularity particularly suffered. 
</P>
<P>
The voters' impression of Feinstein dropped significantly, from 66% favorable 
and 23% unfavorable in June to 54% favorable and 35% unfavorable in the latest 
survey. The electorate's impression of Wilson fell somewhat less, from 60%-25% 
to 56%-3l%. 
</P>
<P>
However, party loyalty is strong. Democratic voters back Feinstein by nearly 3 
to 1; Republicans support Wilson by nearly 5 to 1. Independents side with 
Feinstein by 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic women back Feinstein by nearly 5 to 2, and Republican women support 
Wilson by almost 5 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
When interviewers asked voters to name "the single most important quality" that 
drew them to their candidate, the predominant answer was not a personal trait, 
but political philosophy -- clear evidence that party labels are helping people 
define the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
On primary election day, Times Poll interviews with voters as they left the 
ballot booths showed that the overriding factor in Feinstein's historic victory 
was that many Democrats decided "it's time we had a woman governor." Later in 
June, with Republicans inserted into the electoral mix, the voters as a whole 
disagreed with that statement by 4 to 3. They still do, by roughly the same 
ratio, according to the latest survey. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also oppose, by 5 to 4, the notion that "California's governor ought to 
see to it that the number of women and minorities appointed to state government 
jobs is in proportion to their share of the population" -- as Feinstein has 
pledged to do. This is the so-called quota issue, one that Wilson has tried to 
hang around Feinstein's neck. So far, the effect seems to have been minor. 
Voters are about evenly divided over which candidate they think "would make the 
best appointments to public office." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion remains a potent issue for Feinstein, as it was throughout her 
Democratic primary campaign against Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. Although 
Feinstein and Wilson have similar positions on abortion -- they both support a 
woman's right to decide for herself whether to have one -- voters believe by 
nearly 5 to 2 that Feinstein "would do the best job of handling the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Eight in 10 California voters think a woman should have the right to choose 
whether to have an abortion without government interference, according to the 
survey. Abortion ranks second -- just behind the environment -- on the voters' 
list of "important issues" they are using to measure the gubernatorial 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Voters who regard the environment as a decisive issue are leaning slightly 
toward Feinstein, interviews showed. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 3 issue on the voters' list is crime, and this works best for Wilson. 
Although Feinstein and Wilson strongly support the death penalty, voters think 
by nearly 2 to 1 that the Republican candidate would do a better job of 
fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
Government ethics is the No. 4-rated issue and Feinstein currently has a slight 
edge there. Wilson tends to be seen by voters as being "more closely tied to 
the special interests." 
</P>
<P>
These perceived special-interest ties could become stronger in the voters' 
minds if Feinstein should ever score with her attacks on Wilson for accepting 
$243,334 from the savings and loan industry during his two Senate campaigns. 
Feinstein has been hitting hard on the issue, but with apparently little 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the voters said they do not know of "any candidate running for 
office in California this year who has received large contributions from the 
savings and loan industry." Only one in 10 cited Wilson. But six in 10 voters 
said that if there were such a candidate, they would be less likely to support 
the person. Voters who feel this way now are split about equally between 
Feinstein and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
A good issue for Wilson could be the economy, particularly if it gets worse. By 
2 to 1, he is seen as the candidate who "would do the best job of managing the 
state's economy and financial affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Feinstein continues to be haunted by her final year as San Francisco 
mayor, when she left the city with a projected deficit of $180 million. Roughly 
a third of the voters say they are "less likely" to support her because of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Wilson is seen as the candidate who would "do the best job on taxes." 
The latest survey shows that the voters' willingness to pay higher taxes has 
dropped somewhat over the summer -- a period when President Bush for the first 
time signaled his willingness to hike taxes, Californians began paying a higher 
gasoline tax, and Sacramento raised some taxes and fees to balance the state 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
In June, roughly three-fourths of the voters said they would be willing to kick 
in with higher taxes for a specific purpose. That percentage now is down to 
two-thirds. 
</P>

22 HELD IN ATTACK ON QUEEN'S CAR IN NEPAL

Twenty-two persons were arrested Friday for protesting and stoning a limousine 
carrying Queen Aishwarya, two of her children and her sister, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The royal family, which was en route to the Temple of Pashupati Nath for the 
festival of Teej, was not injured in the incident Thursday, although the 
queen's vehicle was badly damaged, the Home Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of two political parties in the interim government denounced the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Such incidents, which devalue democratic values, individual freedom and 
respect, are uncivilized and deplorable," said Ganesh Man Singh, the leader of 
the Nepali Congress. "Such incidents will only help elements who want to 
destabilize the new democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jibraj Ashrit, leader of Nepal's Communist Party, called the attack "a 
deplorable act." 
</P>
<P>
Police, who said officers fired their weapons into the air to disperse the 
protesters during the nighttime attack, estimated the slogan-shouting mob at 
about 60 people. One security officer was injured by a stone, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd shouted "Down with the queen!" and denounced groups loyal to King 
Birendra, the world's only Hindu monarch.

GULF CRISIS ALTERS U.S. VIEW OF PHILIPPINE BASES' VALUE 
</P>

<P>
The future of the largest and oldest U.S. military bases overseas, both of them 
here in the Philippines, may hinge on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
With new negotiations on whether to extend leases for the bases now scheduled 
to begin on Sept. 10, analysts say the rapid U.S. military mobilization has 
forced Pentagon planners to refocus on potential uses for Clark Air Base, Subic 
Bay Naval Base and four smaller military facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, America's only former colony has tried to distance itself 
from the U.S. military buildup in the gulf. President Corazon Aquino has said 
little about the crisis other than to publicly insist that the United States 
must "consult with us" before using the bases to stage combat operations. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary talks on the bases last May occurred amid a sharp reduction in 
superpower tensions and resulting pressure in Washington to cut military 
spending. Chief U.S. negotiator Richard L. Armitage repeatedly threatened to 
abandon the bases if the Philippines focused solely on obtaining higher 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say the gulf conflict has reinforced Washington's view that the 
bases are key to U.S. security and regional peace by protecting sea lanes and 
projecting power in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has taken no public position on the bases. But one draft proposal by the 
Philippine negotiating team calls for closing Clark Air Base next year, 
shutting Subic Bay by 1994 and asking for $600 million a year for the use of 
Subic Bay. Under the current agreement, signed in 1988, Washington pays $481 
million for all six facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The draft calls also for closing Camp John Hay next year. The U.S. military 
rest and recreation facility, situated in Baguio, was a key staging ground for 
U.S. rescue operations in last month's devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino spokesman Horacio Paredes said Friday, however, that the draft was only 
a working paper and "not the only option being considered." U.S. Embassy 
spokesman Stanley Shrager would not comment. "As far as we're concerned, it's 
not official," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aides say that, if the bases are used to mount Persian Gulf operations, Aquino 
fears repercussions against the estimated 60,000 Filipino workers trapped in 
Kuwait and 4,000 in Iraq, mostly construction workers and domestics. They said 
she also fears Filipino casualties in case of war. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are annoyed at what one called Aquino's "harping" on the bases 
and at her government's announced plans to seek an exemption from the United 
Nations sanctions against Iraq in order to ship food to Filipinos trapped in 
Kuwait, where several thousand people have sought sanctuary at the Philippine 
Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's government scuttled the idea after U.S. officials pointed out that the 
plan would risk a confrontation with Western navies enforcing the embargo. 
Instead, about $20,000 was sent to the embassy to buy food.

IRISH HOSTAGE HELD 4 YEARS IS FREED IN BEIRUT;

Irish hostage Brian Keenan was freed by his Lebanese kidnapers after more than 
four years in captivity and arrived in Syria Friday. He was the fifth Western 
hostage released in five months. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian officials said Keenan, 39, would be handed over to Irish Foreign 
Minister Gerry Collins by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Shareh at the foreign 
ministry in Damascus today. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland's non-resident ambassador to Syria, Declan Connolly, who rushed to 
Damascus to follow up Keenan's release, said that Keenan's two sisters also 
were expected to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Keenan, a professor from Belfast who was seized on April 
11, 1986, as he walked to the American University in Beirut to teach an English 
class, would be checked by a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan was freed in Muslim West Beirut by the pro-Iranian Islamic Dawn 
Organization. Witnesses said Syrian intelligence units were roving West Beirut 
a few hours before the release took place. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Keenan, who also holds a British passport, would spend the night 
in an official guest house in the Syrian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic Dawn announced Keenan's release in a brief typewritten Arabic statement 
delivered to the An-Nahar newspaper in West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to release Irish hostage Brian Keenan. The release took place 
at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT)," it said. 
</P>
<P>
It gave no reason for its decision. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency had reported Thursday that a European hostage held 
in Lebanon would be released soon. On Friday, Iran's deputy foreign minister, 
Mahmoud Vaezi, told the Tehran Times that Keenan would be released and said: 
"We are thankful to the Islamic groups in Lebanon who once more showed their 
goodwill toward the West." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Vaezi said the release resulted from "several months of 
efforts of the Iranian officials and Islamic groups in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the West will take similar steps for the freedom of Lebanese 
prisoners and Iranian hostages," Vaezi said. "Such a move will make our efforts 
for the freedom of hostages easier." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven other Westerners are still believed held by extremist Muslim groups in 
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent 
for the Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan was the fifth Western hostage to be released since April. U.S. hostages 
Robert Polhill and Frank H. Reed were freed in April, and two Swiss Red Cross 
workers, Elio Erriquez and Emmanuel Christen, were freed this month. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has linked the fate of the Western hostages to that of four Iranians 
kidnaped by Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen in July, 1982. Although the 
four are widely believed to have been killed, Iranian leaders have repeatedly 
stressed that they would use their influence to obtain the release of Western 
hostages in exchange for help in freeing the Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan spent most of his life in strife-torn Belfast, and he dismissed the 
dangers of Beirut when he went there to teach English in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For four months, he taught at the university, writing home about the beauty of 
Lebanon and the fine cuisine and night life in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan was dubbed Britain's "forgotten" hostage because his plight did not 
receive the same publicity as that of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite and 
British television journalist John McCarthy.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in an urgent personal message to Iraq's 
leader, warned Saddam Hussein on Friday that if he does not immediately obey 
U.N. resolutions, the world body will be forced to impose "extra measures" -- 
an apparent hint at the use of collective military force. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bush Administration pushing hard at the United Nations for the 
approval of embargo enforcement powers against Iraq, Gorbachev in his message 
stressed "the pressing need for the Iraqi government to begin fulfilling 
without delay" U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding the unconditional 
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the immediate release of an 
estimated 12,000 Western detainees. 
</P>
<P>
"Evading the fulfillment of the resolutions will inevitably compel the Security 
Council to adopt corresponding extra measures," Gorbachev warned Saddam in his 
message, according to a summary carried by the official Tass news agency. "It 
now depends on the Iraqi side how the Security Council will choose to act." 
</P>
<P>
In the light of the Kremlin's evolving position at U.N. headquarters, 
Gorbachev's message is likely to prove disquieting to the Iraqis -- perhaps 
precisely because of the ominous vagueness of the "extra measures" envisaged by 
Gorbachev. The message described the situation in the Persian Gulf as 
"extraordinary and extremely dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, negotiators for the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France 
and China announced tentative agreement on a U.S.-sponsored measure endorsing 
military force to uphold a trade embargo against Iraq. American and British 
envoys expressed hope that the agreement by the Security Council's five big 
powers meant that Kremlin objections to the proposed resolution were ending and 
that the full 15-member body would adopt it by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moscow had declined to support the American drive for a U.N. 
resolution authorizing "minimum use of force" to block Iraqi shipping. Only two 
days before Gorbachev's message to Hussein, in fact, Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze said U.N. resolutions already adopted -- including the imposition 
of the worldwide economic boycott against Iraq -- "clearly define the basis for 
a gulf settlement and the methods to attain this." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in what Tass called his "urgent personal message" to Hussein, held 
out the hope that conflict in the Persian Gulf could still be avoided by urging 
the Iraqi leader to "immediately take proper steps" in line with the U.N. 
resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
State-run Soviet media and government officials were at pains to stress a tough 
line against Iraq after the admission earlier this week that Soviet military 
advisers were still teaching the Iraqis to use their Soviet-made weapons. The 
tough line also followed a visit by a top-level Iraqi envoy to Moscow and 
Shevardnadze's willingness to give "serious attention" to Hussein's proposal to 
release the Western captives in exchange for a U.S. military rollback. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's message to Hussein, whose country was a longtime Soviet ally in the 
Arab world, "reiterated the Soviet Union's position of principle that the 
annexation of Kuwait was illegal," Tass said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri 
A. Gremitskikh used the same word -- illegal -- at a government news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"After several days of 'doubts' caused by the recent visit to Moscow of Iraq's 
special representative Saadoun Hammadi, international observers accredited in 
Moscow apparently were convinced today that the Soviet Union's attitude to 
Kuwait's annexation remains unchanged," Tass correspondents Alexander 
Kanishchev and Yuri Rublevsky wrote in a commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials spent much of the week in talks seeking a way out of the 
crisis via diplomacy and have not cut all ties with Iraq, in an apparent effort 
to maintain their status as potential mediators. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's 
ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, met with 
Shevardnadze in Moscow and said the Kremlin could help "persuade" Hussein that 
he had erred by invading Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime Friday, about 100 Arab demonstrators chanted anti-American slogans 
in a well-choreographed protest held on a parking lot across a side street from 
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Men in their late 30s or 40s dressed in suits 
instructed the assembly, described in leaflets as a grouping of "Arab 
students," on what slogans to shout. 
</P>
<P>
As dozens of Soviet police officers stood between the embassy building and the 
protesters, the Arabs waved Iraqi flags and portraits of Hussein and chanted in 
Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
No trouble was reported, but U.S. officials were worried enough beforehand to 
clear the sidewalk in front of the embassy of its customary throng of visa 
applicants and to post memos warning embassy personnel to stay away from 
windows.

BUSH SEEN READY TO USE FORCE ON IRAQ DESPITE RISK TO HOSTAGES; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: HE IS DETERMINED NOT TO REPEAT THE ERRORS OF PREDECESSORS. BUT OTHER 
DECISIONS COULD DETERMINE WHETHER HE WILL EVER FACE THAT FATEFUL CHOICE.

<P>
With the Persian Gulf crisis entering its fourth week, President Bush has 
apparently made what may be the most fateful decision of all: If necessary, he 
will use military force against Iraq regardless of the cost to American 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he faces a series of related decisions that could determine whether, in 
fact, he will ever face that fearful choice. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who as vice president chaired a task force that drafted U.S. policy on 
terrorism, is determined not to repeat what he and his key advisers see as the 
errors of his two immediate predecessors, who -- as this White House sees it -- 
allowed Middle East policy to be driven almost solely by the hostage issue. 
</P>
<P>
"As traumatic as it is for the families (of hostages), we cannot let Saddam 
(Hussein) shift the focus to a hostage issue," one senior Bush Administration 
official said. "Then we will have lost." 
</P>
<P>
Although Administration officials have tried to avoid putting the matter too 
bluntly in public, Bush himself has made his intentions clear. The hostages' 
lives are important, he said at a news conference Wednesday, "but international 
law . . . must be enforced." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Bush's senior advisers are hopeful that a military confrontation with 
Iraq can be avoided. Some aides point to what they describe as signs that Iraqi 
President Hussein is beginning to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
But officials concede that they do not know which side will suffer more as the 
confrontation drags on, and they acknowledge that Hussein may yet be able to 
find a way to break out of the net now tightening around him. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bush has received sharply contradictory advice on a key issue in 
the conflict -- exactly how far the Administration should try to push Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Many argue that Hussein poses such a threat to his neighbors and to U.S. 
interests that the United States should use the current crisis to eliminate him 
-- shunning any less drastic resolution of the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
That position has been advocated by several U.S. foreign policy experts. It 
also has been pushed, with particular force, by some of Iraq's neighbors in the 
Middle East, including leaders of Arab nations in the Persian Gulf and Israeli 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the crisis, Bush had appeared to accept that analysis. Now, however, 
the magnitude of the task and the uncertainty about whether Hussein would be 
replaced by anyone better has caused second thoughts within the White House 
about the dangers of overreaching. 
</P>
<P>
Within Bush's inner circle, some officials are now known to believe that the 
United States should pursue more limited aims -- simply, Iraq's withdrawal from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts on the Middle East say the argument may be more academic than 
real. Hussein will inevitably fall from power if he is forced to withdraw from 
Kuwait, said Geoffrey Kemp, a former National Security Council staff member now 
with Washington's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over ultimate aims, however, could have a strong impact on 
questions such as what conditions the Administration should set for 
negotiations with Iraq and how quickly U.S. use of force in the conflict should 
be escalated. 
</P>
<P>
As Administration officials now see it, the Persian Gulf standoff is about to 
move into a new phase. For the first three weeks, action in the conflict 
centered around preparations by both sides -- the massive deployment of ships, 
planes and soldiers by the United States and the moves by Iraq to take hostages 
and settle peace terms with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
During that preparatory phase, U.S. officials worried that the situation could 
explode at any moment with a preemptive strike by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
That phase seems to have come to an end. White House officials are confident 
that with tens of thousands of American troops now in place in Saudi Arabia and 
an armada of ships in the surrounding gulfs and seas, Iraq's "window for 
action" has closed. Any Iraqi attack on U.S. forces, Bush aides feel, could now 
be repulsed. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the groundwork has now been laid for a firm international 
blockade of Iraqi commerce. 
</P>
<P>
And there are signs that Iraq already has begun suffering because of the cutoff 
of its oil exports and efforts to block its imports of everything from the corn 
it uses to feed livestock to the glycol solution it needs to keep vital oil 
pipelines from clogging. 
</P>
<P>
With the preparations finished, the focus of Administration deliberations is 
shifting to the question of what the second phase will bring, and what U.S. 
goals for it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Answers could come as early as this weekend, officials say, with a likely first 
U.S. move being military action to disable Iraqi tankers that have been 
shadowed for a week by Navy warships. 
</P>
<P>
Once that decision is made, officials expect the crisis to move into a 
potentially lengthy period of nervous waiting. Both Washington and Baghdad will 
probably try to decide whether U.S. and international patience for a long-term 
confrontation in the gulf can outlast Iraq's import-dependent economy. 
</P>
<P>
At least some senior Administration officials believe that if Hussein comes to 
the conclusion that time is running out on him, he will actively seek a 
face-saving diplomatic solution that would allow him to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Those who advocate limited goals for the conflict argue that Bush should try to 
facilitate those negotiations. Advocates of using this crisis to eliminate 
Hussein argue that Bush should not give the Iraqi leader such an escape route. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some in the Bush Administration expect that a cornered Hussein will 
try to "lash out" and open hostilities. If so, Bush seems committed to a 
powerful military response, even if thousands of Americans and others remain at 
Hussein's mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Hostilities could also begin from the U.S. side. 
</P>
<P>
For now, officials say that the Administration is not seeking provocation and 
is content to give its current strategy time to work. The signs so far have 
been encouraging, they feel, with analysts suggesting that Hussein appears 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
But if the U.S. position begins to deteriorate -- particularly if Hussein 
begins to succeed in his efforts to influence public opinion in key Arab 
countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria -- Bush may have to move to a 
more active military posture. In addition, military action almost certainly 
would be ordered if Iraqi moves cost American lives. 
</P>
<P>
However hostilities started, the lives of the foreigners held hostage in Iraq 
would clearly be placed in danger. 
</P>
<P>
For the past dozen years, the prospect of causing the death of hostages 
paralyzed two Presidents. Inevitably, said Judith Kipper of Washington's 
Brookings Institution, a hostage-taking "raises the stakes politically for the 
President." In Bush's case, the stakes could be particularly high because of 
the huge numbers involved -- hundreds, potentially thousands, of citizens of 
nations from across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush and his aides are determined to prove that they will neither bargain 
for the release of hostages, as President Ronald Reagan did, nor allow the 
hostages' fate to paralyze their decision making, in the manner of President 
Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the White House has been pleasantly surprised by the relatively placid 
public response to the hostage-taking. But officials are steeling themselves 
for the criticism that will no doubt come if hostages are harmed, preparing to 
argue that, with citizens in practically every nation on Earth, the United 
States must demonstrate that it will not be paralyzed by those who make 
Americans captive.

DIVIDED LOYALTIES TEAR AT EX-IRAQIS IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many of the 8,000 Christian Iraqis who have settled in San Diego over the 
years, these are excruciating times: Their adopted country and their homeland 
may be poised to do battle. 
</P>
<P>
Over newspapers and television news in their living rooms, over the backgammon 
boards at the social hall, over the cash registers at their markets and gas 
stations, and in the pews of their church in El Cajon, these Chaldeans are 
frightened and anxious, trying to balance their civic loyalty to the United 
States with their ingrained love for their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"We are feeling hurt for both sides," says the Rev. Michael Bazzi, pastor of 
St. Peter Chaldean Catholic Church, which with 3,500 families is the focal 
point for the largest Chaldean community in the United States except for 
Detroit. They are most heavily concentrated in El Cajon, La Mesa, Spring Valley 
and East San Diego. (Chaldeans are Eastern rite Christians, and Chaldea is a 
region of the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq. Most 
Iraqis are Muslims.) 
</P>
<P>
Like Bazzi, the Chaldeans talk tactfully and cautiously, weighing their words 
for fairness and wary that their thoughts might be misconstrued and turned 
against them, as they assess, both intellectually and emotionally, the events 
unfolding in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"We are Americans, but my relatives are there, in Iraq," Bazzi said. "Anything 
I say, I will be hurting one side or the other. 
</P>
<P>
"We are praying. What else can we do?" he asked. "We have people in our 
community going to Saudi Arabia (as American troops), fighting their cousins 
across the border. 
</P>
<P>
"So what is there to say? Our cousins, our friends, our people are now in 
trouble, yet the Americans are also our people. We are troubled." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Chaldean community is relatively tightly knit. Although they 
dominate no one corner of San Diego's community, and although the names of 
their businesses and retail stores give no hint of the owners' heritage, they 
are proud of their cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
Many say they spend such long hours to make a success of their businesses, 
working 16 hours a day, seven days a week, that they don't have time to 
socialize with one another. 
</P>
<P>
Others do, meeting at their private El Cajon club, where on Friday nights they 
wear their own Western clothing but enjoy the strains of Middle Eastern music 
and delight in the authentically dressed belly dancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell our members they can wear Arab clothing, but they wear regular Western 
clothes," said Sam Hirmez, who owns a San Diego convenience market and is 
president of the 350-member Chaldean American Assn., a social club. 
</P>
<P>
But they are reluctant to abandon their heritage. Middle Eastern dinners are 
served at the club, and backgammon is enjoyed among the regulars. At nearby 
Cuyamaca Community College, a course is taught in Chaldean culture and 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit was the first and most popular settling area for Chaldeans emigrating 
from Iraq, given its employment base and the opportunity for non-English 
speaking Chaldeans to find work on the assembly lines. But some looked directly 
to California and settled in the quiet town of San Diego in the early 1950s, 
and as Detroit's economy and crime problem worsened, many have relocated to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the local Chaldean community shrugs off what prejudice they say 
they feel here against them. There's the infrequent crank phone call, the 
offhanded remark in a store, even the occasional caller to a radio talk show -- 
like the one on Friday who suggested that local Iraqis be sent to their 
homeland and be allowed to return as long as they brought captive Americans 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them worry that Americans do not understand that they are not Arabs, 
but are Aramaic-speaking Christians who were natives of Iraq but who fled to 
America, especially in the 1950s, in search of political freedom and economic 
prosperity. They are, Chaldeans realize, caught in the middle of pitched 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, for instance, California state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita) -- 
a native of Iraq who emigrated to the United States in 1947 -- told his 
legislative colleagues in Sacramento that he backs President Bush's military 
actions in the Middle East. But he urged the President not to create "further 
enmity toward the United States in that part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Other Chaldeans are less supportive of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last two years, the world was going toward peace. Then all of a 
sudden, here's a big mess which could have been avoided by diplomatic channels, 
by politics, by peaceful means," said one Chaldean businessman who refused to 
identify himself. "Yeah, the Iraqi president started it, but the reaction by 
the United States was abnormal. They magnified the problem. They make it sound 
like Iraq is some huge, great country, but they only have a few airplanes to be 
defeated." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their leanings, it is clear that the Middle Eastern crisis has 
permeated Chaldean daily life, dominating conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is sad," said Hirmez, the social club president. "I've been here 
since 1969. This, the U.S.A., is my country. But my second country is Iraq. I 
lived there all my life until I came here. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see peace. I don't want to see any life in jeopardy, to see anybody 
dead, because of this invasion (of Kuwait). I pray for peace."

DIAMOND BAR ENGINEER WHO FLED KUWAIT SAYS 30 OTHERS HESITATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A chemical engineer for an Alhambra oil-drilling firm who escaped this week 
from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait said about 30 Westerners in his residential compound 
could easily have fled into Saudi Arabia during the first few days after the 
Iraqi invasion but decided to stay put on the advice of U.S. Embassy officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sangarapillai Sivapathasundaram, a Sri Lankan national who has applied for U.S. 
citizenship, said embassy officials counseled Americans to remain in their 
apartment complex in Ahmadi, 15 miles from the Saudi border, and await 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"The embassy said, 'Stay put -- we'll make evacuation plans for you when the 
time comes,' " Sivapathasundaram said Friday as he sat with wife and three 
children in the living room of their Diamond Bar apartment. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman confirmed that Americans were told to stay at home 
because "at that time, we didn't know where the Iraqis were or where this would 
all lead." 
</P>
<P>
Today, an estimated 12,000 Westerners have been detained in Iraq and Kuwait, 
including about 3,000 Americans, and there is widespread fear that they could 
be used as human shields in the event of attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to predict in hindsight," the State Department spokesman said. "Ten 
days ago, we expected the Iraqis to roll right into Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
As stories from the front trickle in from escapees, they shed light on events 
and decisions made during those early, confusing days and how the consequences 
of those actions continue to reverberate across the world. 
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq first invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Sivapathasundaram said it took 
troops two days to reach Ahmadi and to mass enough soldiers at the Saudi border 
to seal off the southern escape route. Unlike the capital of Kuwait city, which 
was ransacked by invading Iraqi troops, Ahmadi suffered little destruction, and 
Sivapathasundaram said he witnessed no violence by Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
One exception occurred at a Safeway supermarket, which was looted and burned to 
the ground by Iraqis venting their anger at a symbol of American consumerism, 
the engineer said. 
</P>
<P>
Sivapathasundaram, 43, who worked for the Alhambra-based Santa Fe International 
Corp. in Kuwait for five years, said he shared the foreign compound with 
American, British, Australian, Indian and Taiwanese nationals who worked for 
Western and Kuwaiti oil firms. The group defied Iraqi orders to assemble at a 
nearby hotel on Aug. 16 and were still at the compound when Sivapathasundaram 
left Aug. 18, abandoning all his possessions. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his departure, the group had stockpiled enough food for about 
two months and was attempting to obtain medicine from nearby hospitals to 
counteract the effects of possible chemical attack. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, who has a green card allowing him to live and work permanently in 
the United States, said he decided to make an independent break for freedom 
despite U.S. assurances that he would be part of any evacuation of American 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Sivapathasundaram was turned back on his first escape attempt 12 miles from the 
Saudi border. A second attempt failed when he was unable to connect with a 
Bedouin guide who charged $100 to ferry foreigners across the border by way of 
obscure desert trails. 
</P>
<P>
He finally succeeded by traveling under his Sri Lankan passport as part of a 
convoy of Indian nationals led by a Palestinian guide. The convoy drove 680 
miles across Kuwait and through Iraq, including Baghdad, before reaching 
freedom in Jordan. At roadblocks every 50 miles, the Iraqis stopped and 
searched their cars for weapons before waving them on. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer said Iraqi soldiers held up a convoy of Hungarians for hours at 
the border, examining their passports assiduously to make sure they were not 
Americans attempting to sneak out with false papers. 
</P>
<P>
Sivapathasundaram said the roads were littered with the shells of cars that the 
Iraqis had stripped of their engines and tires. The group also passed massive 
convoys of advancing Iraqi troops and tanks that snaked for up to three miles 
along the highway. 
</P>
<P>
Before his escape, Sivapathasundaram said he and the other residents of the 
compound -- including seven women -- spent their days watching Cable News 
Network and listening to the British Broadcasting Corp. and Voice of America. 
For diversion, they played games, and two men even took to indoor jogging to 
keep up morale. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans never left the compound for fear of attack by Iraqi soldiers, 
relying instead on Sivapathasundaram and several other non-Western colleagues 
to make trips into town for provisions. As of Aug. 18, about 5% of the food 
stores were still open, selling canned food, biscuits and Arabic bread, 
Sivapathasundaram said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Americans in his compound were in daily contact with the U.S. 
Embassy via telex and fax machines. The group learned of the invasion early 
Aug. 2, when friends called them from Kuwait city and told them that the Iraqis 
were swarming over northern Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Sivapathasundaram said he and his colleagues were nonplussed, 
believing that Iraqi soldiers would loot Kuwait city, seize some of the rich 
oil-producing fields along the county's Persian Gulf coast and then beat a 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us could have gotten out easily, especially on the first day," 
Sivapathasundaram said. "But we thought, 'OK, we'll sit tight; they'll loot, 
and then they'll go back.' "

DIPLOMACY: AMBASSADOR HOWELL -- ON THE POINT OF LEAVING WHEN IRAQ INVADED -- 
LEADS A SMALL GROUP OF TRAPPED AMERICAN DIPLOMATS.

W. Nathaniel Howell, the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait, had completed his 
three-year assignment in the Persian Gulf sheikdom and was hoping to get back 
home to Virginia before the month was out. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate already had confirmed his successor, Edward W. Gnehm, and Howell -- 
who had spent most of his 25-year Foreign Service career in the Arab world -- 
needed only make final preparations and say a last round of goodbys before 
leaving for vacation and a new posting. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Howell found himself Friday trapped in occupied Kuwait, at the head of 
a small group of besieged American diplomats who remained at the U.S. Embassy 
in defiance of orders issued by the government of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
According to friends and associates, it is a challenge that Howell will handle 
with calmness and courage. 
</P>
<P>
Nat Howell, as his friends call him, is a portly, bearded man of 50 years whose 
hair is apt to head in 70 directions at once. He speaks Arabic and French and 
has an immense intellect, often angering both Arabists and Zionists who tend to 
argue issues in the Middle East from positions based on emotions. His has the 
ability, friends say, to see humor in every situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Nat as a very sound, steady kind of fellow who was able to work in 
a crisis situation without getting flustered," said Hermann Eilts, former U.S. 
ambassador to Egypt. "In the generation of diplomats after my own, he was 
considered one of the bright young comers." 
</P>
<P>
Howell was named ambassador to Kuwait by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. He 
arrived in Kuwait city in August that year, at a time when tankers were sailing 
through the Persian Gulf under the protection of American warships. He 
impressed Kuwaiti journalists by speaking in both Arabic and English upon his 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure there is great opportunity for the development of relations between 
the two countries on the basis of understanding and mutual interests," he told 
the reporters in his arrival remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Before serving in Kuwait, Howell was the political adviser to the commander of 
the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., a unit that 
oversaw the creation of the anti-terrorism Rapid Deployment Force and developed 
contingency plans for Middle East events that would require a military 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of Nat as being an unflappable kind of person," said Nicholas A. 
Veliotes, former U.S. ambassador to Egypt. "He wasn't one who worried whether 
what he did or said would affect his career. He was very outspoken." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, for instance, while the State Department was devoting all its energy 
to negotiating a withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, Howell was telling 
his superiors that Secretary of State George P. Shultz was wasting his time. 
Howell was proven right. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Portsmouth, Va., Howell graduated with honors from the University 
of Virginia in 1961. He received his doctorate from the university in 1965, 
writing his thesis on Kurdish nationalism and the Soviet Union. While studying 
there under Prof. R. K. Ramazani, an Iranian-American who headed the School of 
Government and Foreign Affairs, Howell's interest in the Middle East grew. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my graduate students were unclear what they wanted to do career-wise," 
Ramazani said, "but the remarkable thing about Nat was that the future was 
always clear to him. From the very beginning, he said he wanted to serve his 
country in the Foreign Service." 
</P>
<P>
Howell's first assignment was in Cairo in 1965, where he served as an assistant 
to the ambassador. Subsequent assignments took him to France, Belgium, Lebanon, 
Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Algeria. He was a political adviser to 
U.S. officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels and 
attended the National War College. 
</P>
<P>
"Nat's an activist," said David Long, a colleague at the State Department. 
"He's not intellectually arrogant or domineering, but he's a dominant kind of 
person. He threatens a lot of people, just by the power of his intellect. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to tell him that he would either get kicked out of the Foreign Service 
or rise to the top. I'm glad it was the latter. He's the type of person you 
feel comfortable with being in charge during a crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Howell accompanied a 30-car convoy of Americans leaving Kuwait for 
the Iraqi border. He watched them drive on toward Baghdad and presumed safety, 
then got back into his car and returned to the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city, 
where it was uncertain what dangers Iraq's demand to close the facility would 
bring.

FORMER CIA AGENT TO FACE TRIAL ON IRAN-CONTRA TAX CHARGES

A federal judge refused to dismiss tax charges brought against a former CIA 
agent, saying that Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has the 
jurisdiction to try the case, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trial of Thomas G. Clines on the four-count indictment will 
begin as scheduled on Sept. 4 in Baltimore, said Mary Belcher, spokeswoman for 
Walsh's office. 
</P>
<P>
Clines assisted the Nicaraguan Contra arms resupply network run by Richard V. 
Secord and Albert A. Hakim and overseen by then-White House aide Oliver L. 
North. He helped find a European arms dealer as a source of weapons, helped 
arrange for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Clines, accused of hiding arms sales profits from the government, was indicted 
Feb. 22 on charges of under-reporting his income to the Internal Revenue 
Service and failing to report foreign financial accounts to the Treasury 
Department. If convicted on all counts, he could face a maximum of 21 years in 
prison and $950,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Norman P. Ramsey in Baltimore rejected Clines' requests to 
dismiss the charges and to suppress financial records obtained through the use 
of a U.S.-Swiss treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Clines' attorney, Paula Junghans, said the tax case was outside the Iran-Contra 
prosecutor's jurisdiction because "Mr. Clines has not been charged with 
committing any crime by virtue of his participation in the purchase, sale or 
transfer of arms . . . nor has he been charged with any crime relating to . . . 
support to the Contras." 
</P>
<P>
But Walsh's office argued that "crimes involving the attempt to hide arms sale 
profits" are within Walsh's purview. The independent counsel said Clines 
"illegally misrepresented . . . on his tax returns the full amount of his arms 
sales profits and that he illegally hid from the United States government the 
existence of the foreign financial accounts.

LELAND'S FATAL ETHIOPIA CRASH LAID TO WEATHER, PILOT ERROR

Bad weather and improper flight preparation contributed to the plane crash that 
killed Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and 15 others last year in Ethiopia, a 
report issued Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority said the pilots erred by "pushing too 
far and flying into an area of bad weather at a very low altitude." 
</P>
<P>
Leland, who was chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was flying 
from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa to Fugnido, a refugee camp on the 
Sudanese border, to inspect relief efforts. Three congressional staffers also 
died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The plane ran into a mountainside more than an hour after takeoff on Aug. 7, 
1989. A tight flight schedule and the importance of the mission may have 
pressured the crew to fly in bad weather, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a 1980 Twin Otter, had no defects and crew members reported no 
problems during the flight, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian agency's report was released by the National Transportation 
Safety Board.

5 LEGISLATORS IN S. CAROLINA FACE BRIBERY CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
INDICTMENTS: THEY ARE ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING MONEY IN EXCHANGE FOR SUPPORT OF A 
PARIMUTUEL BETTING BILL. LOBBYIST WORKED FOR FBI IN PROBE.

<P>
The cloud hanging over the South Carolina Legislature burst dramatically Friday 
as five lawmakers were indicted on federal charges that they "sold their votes 
for cash." 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Columbia, the state capital, returned felony 
indictments against state Sen. William Lee and state Reps. Daniel Winstead, 
Robert Brown, Robert Kohn and Luther Taylor, charging them with accepting 
bribes in exchange for support of a parimutuel betting bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The indictments, simply put, allege that each of these public officials sold 
their votes for cash," U.S. Atty. Bart Daniel said in a statement in Columbia. 
He said also that there will be more indictments. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments result from a 16-month investigation that included a sting 
operation, code-named Operation Lost Trust. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators charge that lobbyist Ronald Cobb, working undercover for the FBI, 
offered thousands of dollars in cash to the legislators -- and they took it. 
Cobb, a cigar-smoking, back-slapping former state legislator, allegedly 
conducted the transactions in a Columbia hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
The case had cast a pall over the capital since it came to light last month 
that federal agents had subpoenaed the spending records of every one of the 
state's 124 House members and 46 senators. The indictments signal that the 
scandal will run a long course, opening the state up to even more political 
trauma as trials unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Daniel said: "This investigation is continuing. We expect more 
indictments in the coming months." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the disclosures about the sting operation, there were frantic 
calls for reform of the state's liberal campaign finance laws. In South 
Carolina, politicians are allowed to accept unlimited cash contributions, and 
lobbyists are not required to itemize the contributions. By contrast, North 
Carolina allows a candidate to accept no more than $100 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on the likelihood that reforms will be enacted, First Assistant 
U.S. Atty. John McIntosh said that such action "is up to the Legislature. 
They're the ones to enact it. We hope the public will demand it." 
</P>
<P>
Aware of the negative impact the scandal has had on the public's opinion of 
state legislators in general -- even those not implicated -- Daniel said: "The 
vast majority of our elected officials in the state Legislature are honorable 
men and women who serve the public in the finest sense of the term." 
</P>
<P>
John Harley, special agent in charge of the FBI in South Carolina, confirmed 
that meetings with legislators were recorded on audiotape and videotape and 
that a phony business was used as a front. 
</P>
<P>
Sting operations similar to the one in South Carolina have been aimed at 
lawmakers in several states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
In Columbia, the five legislators are charged with violating the federal Hobbs 
Act, which makes it illegal for a public official to accept money as an 
inducement for promising to perform an official act. 
</P>
<P>
The one-count indictment against Lee alleges that he accepted "a $2,000 cash 
bribe" for his support of the parimutuel betting bill that was pending during 
the 1990 legislative session. Winstead is charged with one count of accepting 
$1,000 and another count of obstruction of justice. Brown is charged with one 
count of taking $2,000. Kohn is charged with one count of conspiracy, alleging 
that he agreed to accept cash and to recruit colleagues to support the betting 
bill. Taylor is charged with one count of conspiracy and five counts of 
accepting cash totaling $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment and a fine of 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although trials have yet to be held, the case has already created fallout. Kohn 
has announced he will not seek reelection. Taylor was suspended Friday, in 
accordance with House rules. Winstead and Brown resigned Thursday. In his 
resignation letter, Brown said: "I hope my work and dedication to improving the 
quality of life in my county and our state will not be totally overshadowed by 
any mistakes I have made."

A former dairy princess was sentenced Friday to life in prison, without 
possibility of parole until 2003, for strangling a former homecoming queen in a 
jealous rage over a farmer whom both women loved. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Esker, 21, was convicted in June of first-degree intentional homicide for 
the September, 1989, slaying of Lisa Cihaski, 21, who was strangled with a belt 
in a car outside of a Wausau area motel. 
</P>
<P>
Marathon County Circuit Judge Michael Hoover, after six hours of testimony and 
arguments from attorneys, decided not to set a parole eligibility date for 
Esker, so the former Marathon County dairy princess automatically becomes 
eligible for release after 13 years and four months in prison.

Jeroni Llorca of Llorca Protective Systems said Thursday the company had

BROWN AGAIN PUSHES EARLY PRIMARY BILL

<P>
Democratic state Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr. said Friday the importance of a 
bill making California one of the earliest presidential primary states 
outweighs "speculative" fears of some fellow Democrats in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The former governor, who twice ran unsuccessfully for the White House, said the 
early primary bill would give Californians "a voice that they haven't had for 
50 years in presidential politics." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Brown repeated his strong support for advancing the 
presidential primary from June to early March even as restive fellow Democrats 
in the Senate and Assembly were voicing fears about disturbing the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats and Republicans alike worry that a third election -- in addition 
to the regular primary and the general election -- in presidential primary 
years would invite more citizen-initiated ballot propositions. Legislators 
caution that this could tilt political balances in favor of one party or 
another depending on the popular drawing power of a particular initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown told The Times: "The value of putting California back in the 
presidential nominating process outweighs any speculative consequences about 
how certain initiative campaigns are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any evidence that shows either liberals or conservatives are 
advantaged by having an initiative voted on in March, June or November. 
"Initiatives take on a life of their own whenever they are placed before the 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
But Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), a begrudging 
proponent of the early primary and seldom a Brown cheerleader, later dismissed 
the Democratic chairman's enthusiasm for the bill as self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be a player in the national elections," Roberti said. 
"Consequently, his interest in its impact on government and politics is 
secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the long-stalled but newly revived early primary plan by 
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) insist that it would give California renewed 
political clout befitting the nation's most populous state in the selection of 
party presidential nominees. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the last major states to hold a late presidential primary, California 
has been virtually left out of deciding who the nominees will be in recent 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation that would move the California presidential primary in 1992 to 
early March -- right behind the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary -- 
is expected to be voted on by the Legislature next week. Primaries for 
statewide, legislative and congressional elections still would be held in June. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling Senate Democratic anxiety over advancing the primary is Sen. Bill 
Lockyer (D-San Leandro), a foe of the early primary. 
</P>
<P>
He has warned colleagues that Republicans may try a March, 1992, referendum to 
undo any congressional and legislative reapportionment plans written by 
Democrats in 1991. In drawing new political boundaries, the party in power 
historically tries to perpetuate its dominance into the next decade.

Narcotic investigators with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department arrested 
two Los Angeles men Thursday after finding five kilograms of cocaine and 
$20,000 cash under the back seat of their car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Camacho Espinosa and Loreto Chaidez Mendoza, both 30, were being held 
in Ventura County Jail on suspicion of possessing narcotics for sale, said Sgt. 
Robert Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
Bail has been set at $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
On a tip from the Drug Enforcement Administration in Santa Barbara, 
investigators arranged to meet the men for an undercover buy in Thousand Oaks, 
said Lt. Guy Inglis. 
</P>
<P>
But the two men left the parking lot at Du Par's Restaurants &amp; Bakeries, 33 
W. Thousand Oaks Blvd., before investigators arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 13 narcotics investigators searched for the car on the Ventura Freeway 
before pulling over the suspects at Balboa Avenue in Encino about 5:30 p.m., he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found the cocaine, valued at about $125,000, and $20,000 in small 
bills under the car's back seat and a loaded .45-caliber automatic handgun 
under the front seat, Inglis said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's appointment of a new staff deputy has 
outraged members of a San Fernando Valley ministers' group, who say the 
councilman promised to appoint a candidate recommended by the group in exchange 
for its support during last year's council election. 
</P>
<P>
"We were let down by the councilman," said the Rev. James V. Lyles, pastor of 
the First United Methodist Church in Pacoima, and president of the Ministers' 
Fellowship of the Greater San Fernando Valley. "He has not kept one commitment 
that he has made to us."

Earlier this week Bernardi appointed Richard Packard, who heads the Valley 
chapter of the Black Americans Political Assn., as his deputy, ending a 
yearlong search for a black deputy that was prompted by the demands of the 
ministers' group. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than easing relations between the councilman and the group, the 
appointment has left feelings of bitterness and betrayal. Lyles said the 
ministers would discuss the possibility of issuing a censure or initiating a 
recall campaign against Bernardi during a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Taylor, a member of the ministers' organization, said the councilman's 
decision was "disrespectful and dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to be part of the process," Taylor said. Bernardi "completely 
ignored the whole process . . . we came away from this deal empty-handed." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1989 council election, the ministers' group backed Bernardi after he 
appealed for its help, Taylor said. Several of the 40 ministers "opened their 
pulpits" to the councilman, allowing him to speak at their churches, in some 
cases to crowds of up to 600 people. Many actively campaigned on the 
councilman's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Their support, they say, bolstered Bernardi's faltering campaign against his 
leading opponent, Lyle Hall, who proved to be a strong challenger to the 
longtime incumbent. Bernardi eked out a narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was losing the election, we turned it around for him," Lyles said. "We 
beat the bushes and delivered the votes and he won." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for their support, Taylor said, Bernardi verbally agreed to appoint 
a black deputy recommended by the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted someone who would be able to interface with us," Taylor said. "You 
have to have a special talent to interface with the church community so it 
takes a different kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
The group also wanted to ensure that the person would not "kowtow" to Bernardi, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the ministers recommended Debra King, a community activist; 
Delores DeWitt, a paralegal; and Bishop Milford Harvey of the New Testament 
Church for the appointment to Bernardi's staff. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernardi chose Packard without consulting with the ministers' group. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi denied that any such agreement was ever made or that names were ever 
submitted to him. 
</P>
<P>
"All I promised is that we would carefully consider anybody they nominated, but 
we would make the final decision of who would work in my office as is the case 
with all my employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Out of a field of nine candidates Packard "has what we need at this time," 
Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
"We selected him because he was the best of the nine and because he had strong 
support" in the community, Bernardi said, rattling off a list of Packard's 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers say their outrage is not directed at Packard, but at Bernardi. 
The councilman's disregard of their wishes reflects, Lyles said, a blatant 
disregard for his black constituency. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernardi has a plantation mentality," Lyles said. "The time has long past when 
our masters are able to come to us and tell us who best represents us." 
</P>
<P>
"Richard Packard is a victim of this as much as we are," Taylor said. Packard 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Packard was recommended to Bernardi by a Latino member of his 
staff, and that Packard is therefore more the choice of the Latino community 
than the black leaders. Packard was, ironically, co-chairman of the campaign of 
Bernardi's chief opponent in the last council election -- Lyle Hall.

SANTA CLARITA TO PROCEED WITH SUIT OVER HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council on Friday reaffirmed its decision to file a 
lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to overturn the 
board's approval of a 2,555-unit addition to the giant Stevenson Ranch housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The council met during a special meeting called to reconsider the lawsuit and 
the council's recent decision to oust a member of the city's Parks and 
Recreation Commission. On the parks issue, the council reversed itself, 
reappointing Commissioner Laurene Weste to a new term on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit will challenge the adequacy of the environmental impact report 
prepared for the Stevenson Ranch expansion. Councilman Carl Boyer III, speaking 
after the council's deliberations, said the report was deficient, limited in 
scope and based on old data. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson Ranch, which the developer hopes to expand to 10,000 units, is 
situated west of the Golden State Freeway and south of Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said the environmental report prepared for the developer, Dale Poe 
Development Corp., fails to consider how much traffic the project will funnel 
into Santa Clarita, which is east of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said the lawsuit might be filed as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted recently to sue the county, but in an unusual move 
reconsidered its decision Friday afternoon at the request of Mayor Jo Anne 
Darcy. Darcy said she wanted the council to be aware of the potential impacts 
of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy is a field deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who 
supports the project. To avoid a conflict of interest, Darcy did not attend the 
closed session held to discuss the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Poe, as a condition of winning county approval for the project, has agreed 
to donate 13 acres and $2.4 million for a new school in the fast-growing 
Newhall School District. The company will donate more money and land as other 
phases of the project are approved. Donations ultimately could total $22 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, said the school district hoped to 
obtain the money by November so it could apply for a matching contribution from 
the state. A lawsuit could jeopardize the district's ability to receive those 
funds, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in open session on the parks issue, the council re-evaluated a 
numerical ranking system it had used to rate the candidates vying for three 
slots on the commission. Candidates were rated on a scale of one to five. 
</P>
<P>
Weste was ousted from the panel even though she had received fives from Darcy, 
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon and Boyer. Councilwoman Jill Klajic gave 
Weste a zero and Councilwoman Jan Heidt gave her a one. 
</P>
<P>
Weste was replaced by George Stigile while Commissioners Jeff Wheeler and Todd 
Longshore were reappointed to new terms. Stigile lost his seat after the 
reappointment of Weste. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said he was disturbed that a minority of the council could control an 
appointment. Council members said Friday that they should use the ranking 
system only as a guide for appointments. The council set aside its previous 
action and renamed Weste, Wheeler and Longshore to the commission.

OVERRIDE OF VETO KEEPS PICUS PLAN STUDY ALIVE; 
</P>
<P>
WARNER RIDGE: MAYOR TOM BRADLEY HAD ELIMINATED A $250,000 ALLOCATION FOR AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, SAYING THE CITY SHOULD CONSIDER A COMPROMISE WITH THE 
DEVELOPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid heavy lobbying, the Los Angeles City Council swept aside a mayoral veto 
Friday to revive Councilwoman Joy Picus' effort to block the commercial 
development of Warner Ridge in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 11 to 2 to override Mayor Tom Bradley's veto of a $250,000 
project to study the effect of a Picus-backed amendment to the Warner Ridge 
community plan that would allow only single-family residences on the 21.5-acre 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The developer wants to build several medium-rise office towers, and possibly as 
many as 350 residential units, something that would be allowed under the 
current plan. But homeowner groups oppose that plan and Picus has sided with 
them in an attempt to amend the plan and block commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Picus asked for the money to study changing the plan, but Bradley had vetoed 
the allocation, saying the city should consider a compromise with the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear, however, whether the environmental review can be conducted 
in time to checkmate the developer. "Only a few people in the city attorney's 
office think this can be done in four months," said Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. 
A judge has given the city until Dec. 21 to make the plan conform to the 
current zoning in the area, which is for residential development. If the plan 
is not brought into conformity, the developer will be in a more powerful 
position to achieve its goals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her victory, Picus angrily denounced Bradley's role in the Warner Ridge 
matter, claiming he "poured on all the steam" to lobby council members to 
sustain his veto. 
</P>
<P>
Three lawmakers confirmed for The Times that they were lobbied by the mayor. 
But each asked not to be identified. One of the lawmakers also said he was 
heavily lobbied by Picus. "Oh, God, did she lobby? It was a do-or-die situation 
for her," said one of the three. 
</P>
<P>
Picus was angry enough to give reporters a document purporting to show that the 
developer had contributed $11,000 in campaign funds to Bradley since December, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Picus campaign contribution innuendoes, Fabiani said: "When 
Mrs. Picus can't win by logic or argument, she sadly resorts to personal 
attacks on the mayor; these allegations don't deserve a response." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner chief Robert Gross, like Picus, was happy about the victory but 
bitter that the mayor's veto had caused a 15-day delay in starting the 
environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
"The net result of the mayor's veto is that we lost 15 days of valuable time," 
said Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Time is important to Picus' efforts to block the plans of partners The Spound 
Co. and Johnson Wax Development Co. to build a major commercial project on the 
Warner Ridge site. 
</P>
<P>
In late July, Superior Judge John R. Zebrowski gave the city until late 
December to bring its zoning and community plan for Warner Ridge into 
conformity. 
</P>
<P>
It often takes a year to amend the city's community plans. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Ridge developer Albert Spound said he was disappointed by the council's 
action and pledged to continue with a lawsuit against the city filed by the 
development team. The suit, filed last April, complains that the city -- and 
especially Picus -- is seeking to deprive the developer of its property rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Picus made the land commercial, we bought it because it was commercial and now 
she has tried to pull the rug out from under us," Spound said. "Thank God for 
the court system." In the lawsuit, Picus is accused of flip-flopping on her 
support of the commercial development of Warner Ridge as powerful homeowner 
groups threatened to withdraw their support for her before her 1989 reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the council voted to reject the developer's commercial project, 
which Picus said would inundate Woodland Hills with traffic and smog, and to 
zone the property for low-density housing. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was Picus' principal ally in arguing for an 
override. Yaroslavsky, in an interview later, said lawmakers saw the Warner 
Ridge matter as a classic test between developers and the city. "If developers 
think they can go into court and get the zoning they need to override the 
council . . . then there'll be no end to the challenges," Yaroslavsky warned. 
"This isn't just about Warner Ridge, it's about all neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
City officials claimed there are about 15,000 properties throughout the city 
where -- as at Warner Ridge -- the community plan would permit greater 
development density than the zoning. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's position was that the developer was willing to discuss a 
"compromise" project -- involving less commercial space than the 810,000 square 
feet it had originally sought, Fabiani said. Before spending the $250,000, the 
city should first review the developer's latest proposal; if the new project is 
OK, the money can be saved, Fabiani said.

NEW D.A. POLICY BANS BAIL RELEASES IN SLAYINGS; 
</P>
<P>
RULE CHANGE: THE ACTION, AND AN APOLOGY, FOLLOWED MEETINGS THAT PROSECUTORS HAD 
WITH MINISTERS ANGERED BY THE HANDLING OF SUSPECTS IN THE SLAYING OF A PACOIMA 
PASTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to community outrage over the "absurdly low" bail set for two white 
suspects in the slaying of the black pastor of a Pacoima church, the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office apologized to the victim's family 
Friday and announced a policy change that will generally make suspects in 
murder cases ineligible for bail. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Thompson, chief deputy district attorney, said under the new guidelines 
prosecutors will routinely recommend no bail for suspects in murder cases. If 
circumstances of a case lead prosecutors to deviate from that policy to 
recommend that bail be allowed, any amount under $250,000 will require approval 
of top administrators in the district attorney's downtown offices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a murder case, we are starting with the assumption that there is no 
bail and we go from there," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The policy change follows meetings between prosecutors and ministers and 
community activists from the northeast San Fernando Valley. The community 
groups were angered when prosecutors recommended $20,000 bail for the two white 
teen-agers charged in the July 28 slaying of 54-year-old Carl White, pastor of 
the Apostolic Temple Church in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministers' Fellowship of the Greater San Fernando Valley labeled the low 
bail "lethal racism," and charged that if two black men were accused of slaying 
a white minister then such an amount would not be recommended. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the ministers backed away from charges of racism and lauded the 
policy change and their new-found relationship with the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we asked for," the Rev. James V. Lyles, president of the 
ministers' group, said of the policy and of the district attorney's response to 
their complaint. "I think this will prohibit a similar thing from happening 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said White was killed in his Chatsworth residence by two Northridge 
teen-agers who shot him during a dispute over a minor traffic accident that 
occurred the night before. Three days after the slaying, police arrested Philip 
Dimenno, 19, and Dana Singer, 18. Both were charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Before the suspects' arraignment, prosecutors in the San Fernando office 
recommended the unusually low bail of $20,000 because of several factors, 
including the suspects' ties to the community, their lack of known criminal 
records, their cooperation with investigators and because they lived with their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
But the next day the bail for each man was revoked at prosecutors' request when 
police learned the gun used in the White slaying had been stolen, that the 
suspects had been previously cited for carrying weapons and allegedly had prior 
involvement with credit-card fraud. Singer was never released before his bail 
was revoked, and Dimenno was free less than a day before he was jailed again. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office denied the racism charge raised by the 
ministers. Billy D. Webb, the head of the prosecutors' office in San Fernando 
who had approved the bail recommendation, said he was unaware of the race of 
the victim when he made the bail decision. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing Webb's decision, top officials in the prosecutors' office said 
it was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the courthouse on Friday, Thompson -- one of Webb's 
supervisors -- called the $20,000 bail "absurdly low" and said, "It cheapened 
the life and death of Rev. White." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the tragedy that White's family experienced by his death was 
compounded by the bail error. "They had a right to expect more from the 
criminal justice system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's office released a copy of a letter he sent this week 
to the victim's wife, Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
"The initial decision to recommend the bail for the defendants clearly was 
wrong . . .," Reiner wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Taylor, a member of the ministers' group and president of a consortium of 
local homeowners' groups, said at the news conference that the end to the bail 
controversy will help improve relations between the community and the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ecstatic about the conclusion we have here today," Taylor said. "This 
is the way to work within the system." 
</P>
<P>
The ministers' group is scheduled to meet this morning with Mayor Tom Bradley 
to discuss the bail issue and other community concerns.

OFFICIALS QUESTION IN-HOUSE HIRING; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONNEL: THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION HIRES ITS OWN CHAIRMAN AS AN ANALYST, 
EXACERBATING A FEUD WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OVER NEPOTISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Ventura County Civil Service Commission decision to forgo county recruiting 
procedures and quickly hire its own chairman as a staff analyst has prompted a 
letter of concern from the county's personnel chief and a sharp rebuke by the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The commission hired Chairman Robert C. Embry on July 26, shortly after veteran 
staff member Ray Charles died suddenly. It conducted no search for applicants 
and considered only Embry and another member of the five-person commission for 
the $15,298-a-year part-time job. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as these two people declared themselves, we figured that either one 
would be an excellent staff representative," Vice Chairman Edward Flores said 
Friday. "We didn't think we'd ever get another candidate as qualified." 
</P>
<P>
So instead of taking at least a month to recruit applicants, Embry and 
Commissioner Carolyn Goldsborough dismissed themselves from the closed-door 
deliberations, and the other commissioners picked Embry to work 60 hours a 
month researching county employee appeals, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratification of Embry's contract will be on the Sept. 4 agenda of the County 
Board of Supervisors. In a letter, Personnel Director Ronald W. Komers 
recommends approval of the contract but told the board that he was concerned 
about the procedure used to pick Charles' successor. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no knowledge of the criteria involved" in Embry's selection, Komers 
said in an interview. "I am concerned that there was not a formal process so 
everybody would know what the criteria was." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Komers' concerns, the commission has agreed to work with him to 
create a procedure for future hirings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Komers said he was bothered by how Embry was selected, not by his 
qualifications. Embry, 55, is a professor of business management at Cal 
Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dr. Embry is a fine person and will make a fine staff representative," 
Komers said. 
</P>
<P>
A key Civil Service rule requires competition for vacant jobs, which in Ventura 
County usually includes advertising openings in a newspaper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Civil Service commissioners and their staff adviser are technically not county 
employees and do not have to follow that guideline, even though their salaries 
are paid by the county, Komers said. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said Friday that he agrees that no law was 
broken when the commission chose Embry. 
</P>
<P>
"But it strikes me as a little incestuous to have two members of the commission 
ask for the job and the remaining members make the decision," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public should expect more from a commission that is the gatekeeper 
of the merit system. If there's such a thing as institutional nepotism, this is 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury's comments represent a continuation of his long-running feud with the 
commission and with Embry. 
</P>
<P>
The commission found in April that the district attorney had violated county 
nepotism rules by allowing a division head to keep his new wife on his staff. 
Embry, who called the situation "blatant nepotism," abstained from voting after 
Bradbury accused him of prejudging the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury rejected the nepotism finding, saying that the commissioners were 
irresponsible, incompetent tools of the county employee union. County lawyers 
said they found no violation of county work rules in the district attorney's 
office, but Bradbury eventually agreed to move the employee from her husband's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
r Embry, who also directs the Center of Management Development at Cal Lutheran, 
said Friday that he warned his fellow commissioners that they should not hire 
anyone at their July meeting and instead should ask the Personnel Department to 
recruit candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly advised them that they should go through that process," Embry said. 
"I anticipated that there may be some people who would view this as being 
incestuous." 
</P>
<P>
Embry said, however, that the commission's decision made sense because members 
had been told by at least one top county administrator that there would be 
little interest in a part-time job that paid only $15,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Komers said Friday, however, that he thinks there would have been other 
applicants for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are a number of people in the community interested," most of them 
retired administrators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his new county job and his full-time post at Cal Lutheran, Embry 
is the bargaining representative for an association of civil engineers and 
technicians employed by Santa Barbara County, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PICUS ASKS REWARD IN UCLA STUDENT'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus has asked the City Council to establish 
a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer of Ronald 
Baker, a 21-year-old UCLA student who was found stabbed to death in Chatsworth 
Park two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Baker was last seen June 21 at a bus stop at Victory and Van Nuys 
boulevards in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Baker often went to the park to meditate. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that someone may have seen the man before his death. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just hoping that with the offer of the reward someone might come forward 
with the information that we need," said Detective Frank Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to vote on Picus' request Tuesday.

LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the Aug. 21 article on Lopez Canyon landfill, I have never read such 
a crock. On the one hand, we have the Air Quality Management District, which is 
suppose to make a decision based on health and safety factors regarding the 
surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, we have the city of Los Angeles clouding the issues and 
making predictions of so-called budget cuts and the piling up of garbage if 
Lopez Canyon landfill is closed. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the AQMD will not make the wrong decision based on city pressure, but 
call their bluff, so in my opinion we could all see how the Sanitation 
Department and the city has been lying to us.

THREAT TO BUS RIDERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been a passenger on the commuter express bus from Encino to downtown for 
the past 18 months. Those who ride this bus with me agree that this is an 
excellent service. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the recent months, there is an issue that we, the "commuter 
population," find very distressing. 
</P>
<P>
This service operates out of a park-and-ride lot owned by Caltrans at the 
corner of Hayvenhurst and Magnolia. Within the last month, there have been at 
least four cars stolen from this lot. If this pattern were to continue, I would 
think that it would seriously start to affect the ridership on this bus. 
</P>
<P>
In a city that is crying out for volunteers to use "mass transit," it would 
seem a shame to force those of us who don't want to put another single-driver 
car on the road, who think that the cost of parking in the downtown area, not 
to mention a tax on parking, is outrageous and who really enjoy not having to 
face the stress of driving to downtown, back into our cars, just because no one 
with any authority will do more than turn a blind eye on our plight.

EX-BANK WORKER CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLING $660,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former employee of Bank of America in North Hollywood was indicted this week 
on charges of embezzling $660,000 from bank customers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis R. Isenberg, 64, was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on six 
counts of bank and mail fraud, said Grace Denton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Isenberg allegedly took customers' money that was intended for deposit but 
never actually placed it in an account. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she issued phony receipts to the customers and kept the money for 
herself, Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
When customers came to withdraw their money, Isenberg gave them money taken 
from the accounts of other customers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials discovered her activities after she retired from the bank in 1988 and 
determined the fraud had gone on since 1983, Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
"When she retired, she could not do that anymore," Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Isenberg could receive a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison 
and be fined up to $1.26 million. 
</P>
<P>
She will be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Sept. 4.

'JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR' STIRRING, MEMORABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
When "Jesus Christ Superstar" was first produced on Broadway 19 years ago, it 
caused picketing and protests by religious groups. A rock opera about the final 
days of Christ? A sympathetic portrait of Judas? A question about whether Jesus 
was a man or a god? 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine the stirring and beautifully sung production, in its 
Starlight Musical Theatre premiere at the Starlight Bowl, causing protests now. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is the inevitable softening effects of time. And an 
appreciation of Andrew Lloyd Webber, who made his first indelible imprint on 
the American consciousness with this score. 
</P>
<P>
And the very tone of the production has changed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The show was conceived by Lloyd Webber and lyricist Tim Rice as a portrayal of 
Christ as seen through the eyes of Judas and as a man, not a god. 
</P>
<P>
The original production used modern dress and a cross-cultural cast; it shocked 
some audiences with the raw edges it brought to one of the most famous stories 
ever told. An Asian played Mary Magdalene. A black played Judas in both the 
original Broadway and movie versions of the play. At Starlight, in a more 
seemingly self-conscious choice, the cast is cross-cultural, but Jesus, Judas 
and Mary are white. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest change in "Jesus Christ Superstar" here is one in emphasis -- 
one that will please some and disappoint others. Judas' point of view is muted. 
It is easy here to reject him out of hand as a non-believer rather than to 
sympathize with him as the one man in a band of dreamers who anticipated and 
feared the disaster that would follow when a Jewish leader -- Jesus -- became a 
superstar ripe for the crushing in Roman-occupied Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Still what cannot help to please all is the powerful, pulsating and majestic 
music, performed operatically with no dialogue between songs, except for a 
handful of lines at the crucifixion scene. For most in the packed house, the 
music even overpowered the frequent planes that roar over the Starlight Bowl on 
their way to Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
Amick Byram is compelling and sweet-voiced as Jesus and soars in the song, 
"Gethsemane," in which he questions his destiny. As Judas, Jesse Corti lacks 
force in his early soul-searching scenes of indecision, but seems to grow in 
power after Judas decides to make his betrayal; his final song, "I Don't Know 
How to Love Him," is wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Saffran's Mary Magdalene sings like an angel. There is no toughness 
of the one-time prostitute here, but you get a rich, full, sensuous voice and a 
face that you hate to see step out of the spotlight for even a moment. 
</P>
<P>
P. L. Brown brings dramatic fury to the role of Caiaphas, the leader determined 
to bring Jesus to trial. Jae Ross captures the torment of Pontius Pilate, who 
doesn't want to be the one with blood on his hands but, in the end, gives into 
the rising hysteria of the crowd that demands the crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Machray is the much-needed comic relief as King Herod, the king who 
mocks Jesus. When Reggie Phoenix sings the part of Simon Zealotes, you can hear 
the restlessness of a land of have-nots looking for a leader to liberate them. 
</P>
<P>
The current production favors Biblical costumes (by Ray Delle Robbins), and the 
tone is distinctly reverential. The direction by James Rocco, who also 
choreographed the piece, moves from religious tableau to tableau. The evocative 
sets of ruined stairs and later a cross dramatically suspended in the air, 
designed by Michael A. Anania, are washed in dramatic lighting by Barbara 
Dubois. Working with music director and conductor Lloyd Cooper, Rocco taps into 
wells of passion from the splendid singing cast. 
</P>
<P>
In all the attention given to Lloyd Webber, people often forget that in the 
absence of a book, it is Tim Rice's intelligent, sometimes sardonic and often 
passionate lyrics that bring the story unforgettably up to date. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in retrospect, it was "Jesus Christ Superstar" that catapulted Lloyd 
Webber to stardom. Not only did it spur a revival of his earlier effort "Joseph 
and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," but it precipitated how pop opera was 
to take over Broadway in the form of "Evita," "Cats," "Starlight Express" and 
"Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
But never mind Broadway. If anybody doubts that Lloyd Webber's music taps into 
something irresistible in the local common consciousness, take a look at the 
box office for tonight's SummerPops performance of the music of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sellout. 
</P>
<P>

LO-TEC OFFERING BLENDS NEW DANCE, MUSIC

Beth Mehocic may be a one-of-a-kind in the music and dance world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that I'm the only composer that ever founded a dance company," 
Mehocic said, "but I have always visualized images, shapes and dance designs 
when I composed music, even as a child. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in college, they declared me a dance/music specialist. Everything I 
hear, I see -- and I'm able to verbalize what I see in the designs. Most 
composers don't see anything." 
</P>
<P>
It was Mehocic's knack for fusing kinetic and aural images that led to the 
creation of the Las Vegas Music and Dance Ensemble, an interdisciplinary troupe 
that blends new dance and original music into a single aesthetic experience. 
The troupe will make its San Diego debut in a Lo-Tec concert at Three's 
Company's Hillcrest studio this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we won't be able to bring any musicians with us for our San 
Diego concert," Mehocic said. "Live musicians are a luxury when funding is 
scarce. But I handle all the technical support for our concerts, and I make 
sure the sound quality is very good." 
</P>
<P>
Because Mehocic is artistic director of the Vegas-based ensemble as well as 
composer-in-residence and music director for the Department of Dance Arts at 
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, her main contribution to the company is 
musical. The composer created two of the three original scores on this 
weekend's program. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the score for 'Moving Through Blue' (inspired by the blues movie ' 
'Round Midnight') and 'A Lost Maiden' (a world premiere based on an American 
Indian legend)," Mehocic said. "Allen Strange, a California composer, did the 
other work." 
</P>
<P>
All of the dances on the Las Vegas Music and Dance Ensemble's portion of the 
program were choreographed by Carole Rae, but because Mehocic is fluent in both 
music and dance language, the melding of the two art forms should be seamless. 
If past experience is a reliable guide, this crossover concert should tap 
audiences from two sides of the artistic fence. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually have sold-out houses," Mehocic said, "because we draw from the 
music community and the dance community. It's exciting to get both audiences 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Attracting music aficionados to a Lo-Tec dance concert would be a new 
phenomenon in San Diego. But both halves of this weekend's double bill offer 
sustenance to that portion of the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Lorna Dunn, a San Diego dancer who performed with Three's Company in the early 
1980s, shares the Vegas-based ensemble's affinity for original music. And, with 
support from a San Diego Area Dance Alliance grant, the local dance maker will 
have new music for all four of her dances. 
</P>
<P>
"I like working with original music, and I spend a lot of time going to new 
music concerts," Dunn said. "I'm interested in collaborating -- not just, I 
write the dance to your music, or you write the music to my dance. This is my 
first solo concert. . . . Concerts are more alive with original music." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn will have at least two string players (a violinist and a cellist) 
accompany both performances, "and, with luck, we'll have one more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Three's Company-trained modern dancer says it drives her "nuts to dance 
with a beat. I like to move through music." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I use new music. I can keep my wits together if I don't have to 
dance exactly on the beat." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, this solo appearance has Dunn on somewhat shaky footing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very nervous," she whispered, "even though working with musicians gives me 
confidence. I'm a beginning choreographer, and I'm just doing abstract dance, 
no deep themes. I did that on purpose because I don't like beating the audience 
over the head" with messages. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn's program will include "Four of them," with music by Christian Hertzog, 
"The Board of Examiners," the closest thing to a dramatic work from the 
fledgling choreographer, "New Moon," set to a commissioned score by Christopher 
Penny, and "Farandole," a dance inspired by an ancient folk form.

CAL-SPAN KEEPS AN EYE ON SACRAMENTO POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a political opponent sabotaged his prized bill on ballot initiatives in 
the California Assembly, state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) learned 
about it from a rather unusual source: a television viewer. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Monday, my dear friend Mr. (Thomas) Hannigan (D-Davis) ungraciously moved 
a bill of mine that was on the Assembly floor to another committee than the one 
which had already approved it, a committee which no longer meets so it 
effectively killed the bill," Kopp said. "I was informed of it by my aide, who 
said he learned of it after he received a phone call from someone who saw it on 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
The viewer, Kopp supporter Les Kelting of San Bruno, saw the maneuvering on a 
new cable television channel. Run by a not-for-profit organization called the 
California Channel, the channel has been televising the state Assembly on a 
test basis for the past three weeks. The show is available in San Diego on Cox 
Cable's Channel 25 and Southwestern's Channel 16, both from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
through Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to create a service for Californians much like C-SPAN, the 
not-for-profit channel funded by cable operators that televises congressional 
sessions, government briefings, press conferences and other elements of the 
legislative process in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
If CAL-SPAN survives past its tryout, the network will produce some educational 
programs, but personnel would not attempt to analyze events or conduct 
journalistic investigations. Instead, events would simply be presented, 
unedited, to the public. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according to plan, the California version, to be called CAL-SPAN, 
would start by televising the Assembly and later add the Senate, round-table 
discussions on political issues, viewer call-in programs and perhaps coverage 
of the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"California is the largest state in the union in terms of population, but 
nobody knows anything about the state government," said Paul Koplin, the 
channel's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, not a single out-of-town television station maintains a Sacramento 
bureau. According to a feasibility study conducted for the channel, only 
Wyoming and Montana provide less electronic media coverage of their 
legislatures than California. During the busiest period of the legislative 
session, California television stations devoted just 1.7% of their news time to 
state legislative issues, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the test has won supporters from a Legislature that was initially 
concerned that the presence of the cameras would somehow affect lawmakers' 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Several of us thought it would really have a down side in terms of people 
playing to the camera and making speeches toward a different audience," said 
Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno). "But in one or two days, everybody forgot 
the cameras. People were very quiet and sat at their desks for about an hour. 
Then it was business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
In the three weeks since the trial began, footage has been used not only by 
constituents at home, but by lobbyists and legislators. Aides gather around 
sets to watch what their employers are doing. In one instance, a committee of 
lawmakers were arguing over who had taken what position on a bill during a 
previous debate. Then one remembered the cameras. They pulled out the tape and 
were able to resolve their argument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become almost indispensable already," said Michael Reese, director of 
communications for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). "Right now 
I'm watching it, and they've got the floor debates going on. Bob Epple 
(D-Downey) is debating a bill on post-secondary education. And now they're 
taking a vote and I can watch the vote. It doesn't replace going down to the 
floor, but since I can't go down right now, I can still watch it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Assembly decides to make the channel a permanent fixture, it will mean 
making a significant budget commitment at a time when funds are tight. While 
the not-for-profit channel will absorb the cost of distributing the televised 
sessions to local cable channels and pay for program hosts and producers, the 
Assembly would have to pay for the actual cost of buying and running the 
cameras. Koplin estimates that it would cost $1 million to wire the Assembly 
floor and one committee room for television and buy cameras, plus about 
$450,000 per year in operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
"By comparison, this is a fraction of what it used to cost for us to send out 
our newsletters," said Bronzan. With newsletters done away with as a result of 
a budget balancing ballot initiative, and the dearth of television reporting 
about Sacramento, CAL-SPAN may be the only way most Californians can gain 
information about state government, Bronzan said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Singer, news director of KCBS Channel 2 in Los Angeles, said he doesn't 
think that merely televising the Legislature is enough to inform people about 
state government. "Legislative sessions are usually not where the story is," 
Singer said. "The story is what's going on outside the legislative chamber and 
what the implications of the story are." 
</P>
<P>
Rollin Post, veteran political correspondent for KRON television, the NBC 
affiliate in San Francisco, said simply televising the legislature is not 
enough to replace serious coverage of Sacramento -- coverage that has been 
lost. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : CAMARENA MISTRIAL MOTION MAY BE HEARD IN 
OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal prosecutor said Friday he anticipated that a hearing on a defense 
motion for a mistrial in the recently concluded Enrique Camarena murder case 
would be held in October. Lawyers for four defendants convicted in the Los 
Angeles trial filed for a mistrial last week because of alleged juror 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Juror William R. Parris of Lancaster had signed a sworn declaration alleging 
that jurors frequently ignored U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie's 
instructions to avoid news accounts of the trial and that a federal marshal 
urged the panel to return a quick verdict on one of the defendants. The 
declaration alleged that during deliberations jurors skimmed newspaper 
headlines about the case on a daily basis and discussed information they had 
heard on television about the trial.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : W. HOLLYWOOD CARD CLUB BACKERS LOSE COURT 
BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of a proposed West Hollywood city ordinance that would allow a card 
club to be built lost a court bid Friday to have much of an argument opposing 
the measure stricken from the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David Yaffe ruled that such language as "sleazy," "fraud" 
and "scam" must be allowed in the argument opposing the measure because there 
was no "clear and convincing evidence" to show the argument is false. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yaffe ordered the city clerk to strike a portion of the argument that 
alleges other cities that have allowed card clubs to be built experienced more 
crime. Bradley Hertz, a lawyer representing Bruce Decker, who wants to build 
the card club, said he presented statistics to Yaffe showing that crime 
actually declined in the city of Bell when a card club was built there.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : DEFENDANT WANTS DEATH PENALTY IF CONVICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reputed hit man in the "Cotton Club" murder case told a judge Friday that if 
convicted at his upcoming trial, he plans to ask jurors to recommend the death 
penalty for him. 
</P>
<P>
The reputed hired killer, Alex Marti, 30, asked Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Curtis Rappe for permission to act as his own attorney at his trial, 
which is scheduled to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
The motion was denied. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also denied motions to have Marti and his three co-defendants -- 
Karen De Layne Greenberger, 43; William Mentzer, 40, and Robert Ulmer Lowe -- 
tried separately. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have charged that Greenberger hired the three men to kill New York 
theatrical producer Roy Radin in 1983 because of a dispute over financing of 
the movie "The Cotton Club."

WITH UNION OK, 27 SCHOOLS GET SET FOR AUTONOMOUS OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leaders of United Teachers-Los Angeles voted 7 to 0 Friday to approve the 
proposals of 27 schools seeking to operate autonomously, giving them the 
go-ahead to become the first to restructure under the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's school-based management program. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers union's decision follows a 6-1 school board vote of approval on 
Monday, and gives the schools two weeks to change schedules, set up additional 
classes and introduce new programs by the start of school on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our planning done and we're ready to go," said Debbie Leidner, 
principal at Marshall High, one of the 27 schools. "We'll send home letters to 
parents about a week before school starts letting them know exactly what's 
going on, but we've been planning for this all summer. We expect the opening to 
be smooth." 
</P>
<P>
In granting approval, the union leaders and school board agreed to waive 
contract requirements and district policies governing the schools, allowing 
them to operate free from traditional restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
In response to concerns that the plans failed to adequately address student 
achievement -- which is at the heart of the concept of local school control -- 
the school board also added a requirement that the schools set specific student 
achievement goals and submit plans to measure student performance. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools still need waivers from the state to implement portions of their 
plans -- such as changes in curriculum, attendance and graduation requirements 
-- and decisions on those waiver requests could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
But they are now free to begin making other changes. Some will set up "peer 
review" programs, taking the task of evaluating teachers out of the hands of 
principals. Others will let parents help interview and hire new teachers. 
Others will add programs, such as tutoring and study skills classes, and 
lengthen or shorten their school days. 
</P>
<P>
Most administrators agree that their schools will not be radically different 
when school starts next month. Many will spend the coming semester ironing out 
details in their proposals and spreading the word in the community before 
putting the plans into place next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to do about 40 things before school starts, and I know we won't 
have all of our program ready to go," said Jefferson High Principal Frank 
Saldivia. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we want to do is begin school at a later time and allow students to 
attend later in the day, but it wouldn't be fair to the teachers or the 
students to introduce that so quickly, without giving people time to make 
arrangements with their families and all. That's something we'll have to hold 
off on until the spring semester," Saldivia said. 
</P>
<P>
At 4th Street Elementary, a year-round school, Principal May Arakaki plans to 
introduce a new schedule when the next group of new students enters school at 
the end of September. Children will then start class 15 minutes earlier each 
day, and leave school early one day a week, giving teachers time to hold 
meetings or prepare lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents have known about this for a while, but we know it will take some 
adjustments," Arakaki said. "There will be some baby-sitting problems and that 
kind of thing, but we're working with our parents and trying to straighten 
those out. People are pretty excited about the plan and that helps." 
</P>
<P>
Since parents, teachers and school staffs participated in drawing the plans, 
most school principals say they expect to encounter little community opposition 
to the changes this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 schools were among 70 that volunteered last spring to be the first in 
the district to embark on the school-based management experiment, which aims to 
raise student achievement by allowing local schools more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining schools are expected to submit their restructuring plans in 
October and begin making changes next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, all 600 of the district's schools will be run by locally elected 
councils, including teachers, parents, principals and community residents. The 
power-sharing plan began last year, a product of the settlement of the nine-day 
teachers strike. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, elected councils at all the district's schools have limited 
decision-making power. Now, schools will be able to implement their own 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 schools with approved restructuring plans are: 32nd Street 
Elementary/USC Magnet, Los Angeles; Aggeler High, Chatsworth; Allesandro 
Elementary, Silver Lake; Anatola Avenue Elementary, Van Nuys; Chatsworth High, 
Chatsworth; Emelita Street Elementary, Encino; James A. Foshay Junior High, Los 
Angeles; 4th Street Elementary, Los Angeles; Grant High, Van Nuys; Jefferson 
High, Los Angeles; Loyola Village Elementary/Fine and Performing Arts Magnet, 
Los Angeles; Manual Arts High, Los Angeles; Marlton Special Education School, 
Los Angeles; Marquez Elementary, Pacific Palisades; Marshall High, Los 
Feliz/Silver Lake; Melvin Avenue Elementary, Reseda; Monroe High, Sepulveda;

Junior High, West Los Angeles; San Pedro High, San Pedro; Santa Monica

BRADLEY TO PAY FINE FOR ROLE IN CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
SETTLEMENT: MAYOR UNINTENTIONALLY VIOLATED LAW IN AWARDING OF JOB TO A 
CONTRIBUTOR, FPPC SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has agreed to pay a $2,000 fine for illegally 
participating in a decision to give a contract to a political contributor, 
state officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which is expected to be approved by the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission next month, concludes a year-old investigation of 
decisions involving Bradley when he served as chairman of the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The fine is similar to one levied in July against Los Angeles City Councilman 
Michael Woo, who illegally voted to give a political donor a contract while 
serving on the transit panel. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's fine is a result of failing to properly disclose $1,800 in 
contributions from Gruen Associates, a consulting firm, when he participated in 
a decision to award the firm a contract to study a controversial San Fernando 
Valley trolley line. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC imposed relatively light fines on Bradley and Woo after concluding 
that their violations were unintentional. The FPPC also found that the 
transportation commission lacked adequate procedures to alert members to 
potential legal conflicts involving contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that Bradley has "initiated steps to 
rectify this (transportation commission) oversight." 
</P>
<P>
The state Political Reform Act imposes special anti-favoritism requirements on 
commission members, including a ban on voting on matters involving political 
contributors who have given members $250 or more in the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began after The Times reported that Bradley and other 
prominent transportation commissioners had collected nearly $600,000 in 
campaign contributions from commission contractors and that, in some cases, the 
state law was being violated. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Woo quickly returned nearly $20,000 in contributions from several 
contractors after inquiries from The Times.

ARMED YOUTH FATALLY SHOT BY DEPUTIES DURING SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old reputed gang member was shot and killed by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies when he reached for a handgun in his pants during a pat-down 
search in the Athens district of South Los Angeles, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, identified as Courtney Caldwell of Los Angeles, was fatally wounded 
during a stakeout Thursday night by a drug-enforcement unit at a duplex on West 
110th Street. 
</P>
<P>
A fully loaded .38-caliber handgun was found on the dead teen-ager, Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
A squad from the Lennox station was stationed in and behind the duplex about 
9:50 p.m. when Caldwell left a group of companions -- also reputed gang members 
-- in front and walked down a long driveway toward the rear of the duplex, 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
One deputy, whose name was not released, stopped Caldwell for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
"As he was patting him down, the deputy felt a handgun in the suspect's left, 
front pants pocket," Erickson said. Caldwell then pushed the deputy's hand away 
and reached for his gun. The unidentified deputy fired several shots, striking 
Caldwell in the upper chest, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Another deputy inside the duplex, whose name was also withheld, rushed outside 
and fired several more shots at the teen-ager, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who had not fired the gun, was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said it was unclear how many shots were fired or which rounds 
mortally wounded Caldwell.

COUNCIL APPROVES MASSIVE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council gave the go-ahead Friday for a $650-million 
development project bordering the Harbor Freeway, despite protests from some 
council members that it will add congestion to already overburdened freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved, 9 to 4, an agreement between the Community Redevelopment 
Agency and City Centre Development, clearing the way for the first phase of 
construction on Metropolis, a massive downtown complex that will comprise three 
office buildings, a hotel and a retail center. 
</P>
<P>
But several council members denounced the project, saying the 
2.3-million-square-foot development bounded by 8th, 9th, and Francisco streets 
and the Harbor Freeway will only worsen a clogged freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to strangle the city," Councilman Marvin Braude said of the 
development. "We have to ask the fundamental question, 'What's happening to our 
city?' Congestion has overpowered it." 
</P>
<P>
The downtown stretch of the Harbor Freeway is the most congested in California, 
and with the construction of Metropolis and other such projects, peak rush-hour 
traffic is expected to increase 150% by the end of the 1990s, said Bob Rogers, 
chief hearing examiner for the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners believe, however, that "the benefits of the project 
overrode the traffic impacts," said Rogers, adding that the project's 
developers will pay $34 million for undeveloped Convention Center space -- half 
of which will go toward the center's expansion and the other half for city uses 
including housing, transportation, child care and open space. 
</P>
<P>
With the city about to consider an ordinance that would make downtown 
developers pay for the traffic problems caused by their projects, several 
council members expressed concern that Metropolis' first phase of construction 
had a built-in exemption from such a law. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Valenzuela, director of operations for the CRA, said it would be unfair 
to impose the traffic reduction improvement fee on the first phase of the 
development because the developers were negotiating with the agency long before 
such an ordinance was considered. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if such a fee were approved, Metropolis' builders would have to 
pay it for each of the development's four later phases. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will probably begin in January, with completion 
of the complex expected about the year 2001.

JUDAS PRIEST VERDICT OFFERS SMALL COMFORT TO MUSIC INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: DESPITE COURT VICTORY, SOME OBSERVERS SEE RECORD COMPANIES IMPOSING 
CURBS ON ARTISTS' FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday's Judas Priest verdict -- which absolved the British heavy metal quintet 
and their record company, CBS Records, from responsibility for the suicide 
attempts of two Nevada youths -- is being perceived by the music industry as a 
Pyrrhic victory at best. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers expressed concerns that the costly legal battle preceding 
the ruling may have intensified the debate over artistic expression. They 
insist that the financial burden imposed upon CBS Records by the Judas Priest 
product liability lawsuit is only the latest in a series of anti-rock legal 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders point to such varied actions as the continuing 2 Live Crew obscenity 
controversy, a new anti-explicit lyric performance statute in Memphis and 
pending legislation in New Jersey that would mandate government-sanctioned 
warning stickers on 'offensive" records. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, 
suggested that the Judas Priest lawsuit is likely to put a damper on in-house 
company decisions regarding what is considered appropriately protected artistic 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies are starting to become very critically attuned to their liability 
regarding this situation," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the establishment of in-house lyric review panels at various companies 
as the most recent indication of industry caution. 
</P>
<P>
"People won't admit it," Greene said, "but taken into consideration with the 
controversy surrounding 2 Live Crew, I think the Judas Priest decision is going 
to cause artists to think twice about promoting lyrical messages that call for 
action, whether those messages speak to suicide or violence." 
</P>
<P>
But Gail Edwin, vice president and litigation counsel for CBS Records, 
disagreed. Edwin said that while the company had spent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars defending Judas Priest, she did not believe that the trial would 
endanger creative expression. 
</P>
<P>
"The suit was certainly unfortunate, but it will not have a chilling effect on 
the conduct of business by CBS Records," Edwin said. "Still, in my opinion, the 
plaintiffs attempted to make heavy metal music a social issue in this case. 
They pursued it with an evangelical fervor in which they pitted the music 
against what it proclaimed as Christian values." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Goldberg, chair of American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern 
California and president of Gold Mountain Entertainment, said he views the 
Judas Priest lawsuit as but one example of a national crusade bent on 
destroying free speech in entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the most absurd court room episode since the Salem witch 
trials," Golberg said. "It's not just some weird isolated incident. It is part 
of an escalating climate of repression." 
</P>
<P>
The impact of explicit lyrics on American youth has been called into question 
recently by such media watchdog organizations as the Parents Music Resource 
Center, Focus on the Family and the American Family Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, mandatory labeling legislation was introduced and defeated in more 
than a dozen states this year. In response to pending legislation and pressures 
from special interest groups, the Recording Industry Assn. of America created a 
standardized warning sticker to help parents identify albums containing 
allegedly "explicit" lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, several major national retail chains have refused to carry certain 
"offensive" albums and other retail outlets have taken to carding customers who 
wish to purchase albums stickered with warning labels. 
</P>
<P>
But the skirmishes in the continuing battles over explicit lyrics are not just 
being fought on the floors of the state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
A record by Miami rappers 2 Live Crew was declared obscene in a federal court 
in Ft. Lauderdale in June. Subsequently, several members of 2 Live Crew and a 
rock group called Too Much Joy were arrested on separate occasions for 
performing "obscene" material at adult concerts in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
A new ordinance that holds promoters responsible for anything "harmful" that 
minors see or hear at concerts was recently passed in Memphis, Tenn. In 
Georgia, a variety of well-known artists -- most recently Kid 'N Play -- were 
arrested for "suggestive" performances. Rap shows by N.W.A. and Public Enemy 
have been canceled or banned in a number of cities. 
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated a poster of Jane's Addiction's new album cover at a record 
store in Royal Oak, Mich. on Tuesday, charging the owners of the store with a 
misdemeanor for displaying obscene material. Record retailers in Florida, Texas 
and Alabama have also been arrested for selling "obscene" material. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, in response to charges of anti-Semitism and other forms of racial 
insensitivity and bigotry surrounding ethnic slurs in an interview with Public 
Enemy member Professor Griff, CBS Records chief executive Walter Yetnikoff 
recently sent a memo to more than 7,000 CBS employees asking for a dialogue on 
what the company's policy should be in this area. The move was widely applauded 
by other label chiefs, some who promised to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from record company review boards, a number of bands have been 
persuaded to change lyrics and cover art. Certain heavy metal bands and rap 
acts have repeatedly come under fire for allegedly sexist, racist and anti-gay 
lyrics. 
</P>

Geffen Records, whose roster includes the rock act Guns 'N Roses, recently 
refused to distribute the graphically violent and sexually explicit Def 
American album by the Houston-based rap group the Geto Boys. Digital Audio Disc 
Corp., also declined to press the compact disc version of the album. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Records, whose management publicly championed First Amendment artistic 
expression rights regarding its distribution of 2 Live Crew and Audio Two, 
reportedly pressured the heavy metal act Vio-lence to remove a song called 
"Torture Tactics" from its upcoming album.

<P>
Lee Ballinger, West Coast editor of Rock 'n' Roll Confidential, an industry 
newsletter which has been monitoring anti-rock incidents since 1985, applauded 
Judas Priest's commitment to defending their music, but said he feared the 
lawsuit would probably only serve to heighten anti-rock hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
"This case should teach the music industry the value of fighting back," 
Ballinger said. "But unfortunately, standing up for rock 'n' roll is not a top 
priority on the corporate agenda these days." 
</P>
<P>
Ballinger said it would not surprise him if CBS and the record industry began 
using the costly trial as an excuse to stifle creative risk-taking. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the industry is looking for a place to hide," Ballinger said. "There 
is no doubt in my mind that this case will cause them to burrow in even 
farther."

A 'COSBY' BLOOPERS EPISODE BEATS 'SIMPSONS' RERUN, BUT NOT IN L.A. 
</P>

It's still only summer and still only reruns, but "The Simpsons" was no match 
for a fresh bloopers episode of "The Cosby Show" in their first head-to-head 
battle, according to ratings released Friday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
But even with an episode that has repeated three times on Fox, "The Simpsons" 
did beat NBC's "Cosby" in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The show, about 
mischievous Bart's decapitating a statue of his hometown's founder, nationally 
managed a second-place finish in its 8 p.m. Thursday time slot, beating repeats 
of "The Father Dowling Mysteries" on ABC and "48 Hours" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily promoted "Cosby" special, which was filled with outtakes and 
blunders from the show's previous six seasons, registered a 15 rating and a 28% 
audience share. (Each ratings point represents 921,000 households.) "The 
Simpsons" scored an 8.4 rating and a 16% share of homes watching television at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest market, "The Simpsons" beat "Cosby" 
by more than 182,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
While "Cosby" will begin airing original episodes next month, "The Simpsons" 
will not get a new episode on the air until late October because of the 
animated series' complicated production process. Fox executives so far have 
downplayed the David-versus-Goliath confrontation with "Cosby," claiming they 
have little hope of toppling the longtime ratings champ and that they would be 
satisfied merely with establishing a firm toehold on Thursdays -- a new night 
of programming for the 3 1/2-year-old network. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled with these results" was all a Fox spokesman would say Friday. 
Peter Chernin, president of Fox Broadcasting, was not available to comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
The debut of NBC's new sitcom "Ferris Bueller" won its 8:30 time period 
Thursday, beating a repeat of "Married . . . With Children" on Fox and the 
second half-hour reruns of "Father Dowling" and "48 Hours" on ABC and CBS. But 
the new series lost three share points from its "Cosby" lead-in and lost 
outright to "Married . . . With Children" in Los Angeles. Based on the hit 
movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," the series with Charlie Schlatter will be 
seen regularly on Monday nights at 8:30 beginning next month.

FROHNMAYER DENIES 'NEA 4' GRANT APPEALS; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS FUNDING: THE NEA CHAIRMAN REJECTS REQUESTS BY CONTROVERSIAL PERFORMANCE 
ARTISTS, SETTING THE STAGE FOR LAWSUIT CHALLENGING THE DECISION AS POLITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The National Endowment for the Arts has rejected appeals by four controversial 
performance artists denied fellowships last month. The denial apparently sets 
the stage for a lawsuit challenging the grant rejections as illegal because 
political standards were applied to an artistic decision. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in the case of the so-called "NEA Four" by NEA Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer was disclosed Friday by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New 
York City public-interest law group that represents the four artists. 
</P>
<P>
Affected were appeals by performance artists Karen Finley and Holly Hughes of 
New York; Tim Miller of Santa Monica, and John Fleck of Los Angeles. The work 
of Hughes, Miller and Fleck is political and gay in its orientation. Finley's 
is stridently feminist, with strong political overtones. Most of the artists 
occasionally employ on-stage partial nudity as part of their work. 
</P>
<P>
Denial of the appeals by Frohnmayer had been widely expected. Official word of 
the denials was conveyed in letters to the four artists from Randolph 
McAusland, acting NEA deputy chairman for programs, received by the artists on 
Friday. The NEA declined to comment, but lawyers for the artists released 
copies of the official endowment letters, dated Aug 17. 
</P>
<P>
"This only underscores that we are being punished for the controversial content 
of our work," Finley said in a prepared statement issued by her attorneys. "The 
government wants art to be propaganda for the state, and we're not willing to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
The letters said Frohnmayer denied the appeals by all the artists except Miller 
under the chairman's overall authority to "support projects which meet the 
highest standards of professional and artistic quality." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's appeal, the letter said, was denied on the technical grounds that one 
of his letters of recommendation -- from Los Angeles Festival director Peter 
Sellars -- was never received by the NEA. Miller has said in the past that he 
discussed the status of his application on several occasions with endowment 
officials before a deadline for the documents had lapsed and was informed his 
file was complete. 
</P>
<P>
David Cole, a Center for Constitutional Rights lawyer handling the appeals on 
behalf of the artists, said all four of his clients would file suit in federal 
court in either Washington or New York to challenge the NEA decision. 
</P>
<P>
Denial of the appeals was the latest development in a controversy that dates to 
last May when the NEA's advisory National Council on the Arts voted to delay an 
advisory vote on 18 performance fellowships until early August. The original 
vote to delay consideration was taken after a newspaper column published a 
biting description of Finley's work and conservative politicians made it clear 
they would make an issue of any NEA fellowship awarded to Finley. 
</P>
<P>
While National Council on the Arts votes are not binding on Frohnmayer, he is 
precluded from acting on grant applications until the council has voted. 
Apparently attempting to blunt a growing political crisis over the performance 
fellowships, Frohnmayer said in late July that he telephoned national council 
members and secured their approval to reject the four artists in question 
before denying the grants. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA has not said how many members Frohnmayer reached in his telephone 
survey. Several members of the 24-member council have said they were never 
called. One member told The Times several weeks ago that Frohnmayer never 
actually discussed the situation with her but conveyed his inquiry through an 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
At a National Council on the Arts meeting in Washington earlier this month, 
Frohnmayer ruled out of order at least two attempts to reopen discussion of the 
fellowship rejections. Frohnmayer said that appeals were under way and further 
discussion would have been inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said he would base a court challenge on the contention that the grants and 
appeals were rejected on political grounds, not because of artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
All four artists were recommended for fellowships by a review panel of artists 
and arts officials earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer, Cole contended, also "violated NEA procedures in the way that he 
came to these decisions by not convening the national council and, instead, 
calling them up individually." The NEA's 1965 enabling legislation indicates 
that a quorum must be physically present for the panel to act. 
</P>
<P>
"The national council, as a body, has never actually made a determination on 
these applications," Cole contended. "Mr. Frohnmayer made a decision and then 
called the council members individually and urged them to support him." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer's decision to reject the fellowships in July came within days after 
he reportedly told a group of arts leaders in Seattle that "political" problems 
between the NEA and Congress would make it necessary to scuttle the Finley 
fellowship application. 
</P>
<P>
However, accounts of what Frohnmayer said at the meeting have varied. Some 
people in attendance recalled that Frohnmayer mentioned Finley and the 
political need to reject grants in detail; others said they remembered no 
specific discussion of Finley.

THE MUSIC DIDN'T MAKE THEM DO IT; 
</P>
<P>
VERDICT: THE ROCK BAND JUDAS PRIEST IS ABSOLVED OF PLANTING SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES 
ON A RECORD THAT FAMILIES CHARGED LED TO THE DEATHS OF TWO YOUTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two young men did not kill themselves because they heard alleged subliminal 
messages in the heavy metal music of Judas Priest, a judge in Reno, Nev., ruled 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford called the ruling a victory for rock 'n' 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great day for Judas Priest. It's a great day for heavy metal and 
artistic expression," Halford said in a telephone interview from Mexico, where 
he is vacationing. "Still, my main worry is that it seems as if the judge may 
have left the door open on subliminal messages." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing the families of two Sparks, Nev., youths in the 
product-liability suit claimed a subliminal command saying "Do it" and backward 
messages promoting self-destruction concealed in Judas Priest's 1978 album 
"Stained Class" caused Raymond Belknap, 18, and James Vance, 20, to attempt 
suicide. Belknap died instantly, Vance three years later. 
</P>
<P>
In a 93-page decision, Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehead said he could hear 
the subliminal commands, but that the words "Do it" were the result of a chance 
combination of the singer's exhalation of breath and a "Leslie" guitar sound. 
He also ruled that the families of the two young men failed to prove that such 
messages were a precipitating factor in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Judas Priest and CBS Records, the band's record company, denied using 
subliminal messages. 
</P>
<P>
In his conclusion, Whitehead specified that the defendants could not claim 
victory, as they failed to prove that subliminal stimuli have no effect on 
human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather," Whitehead wrote, "plaintiffs lost this case because they failed to 
prove that the defendants intentionally placed subliminal messages on the album 
and that those messages were a cause of the suicide and attempted suicide 
involved in this case. However, it is unknown what future information, research 
and technology will bring to this field." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, which attorneys for the families say they will probably not appeal, 
leaves open the door on a broad new category of product-liability lawsuits, 
according to one of the attorneys in the case. Kenneth McKenna, who represented 
one of the mothers of the dead youths, said he already has several similar 
cases on tap in other states. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is an excellent decision because it should promote people to 
pursue more of these cases in the future," McKenna said. "Sooner or later, 
science is going to catch up with reality and we'll be able to prove these 
cases in a courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
While the judge ruled in favor of the band and CBS Records, in an 18-page 
collateral order that was part of the ruling he imposed a $40,000 "sanction" 
against the record company, saying it had refused to comply with court orders 
directing it to supply certain materials needed to decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Edwin, vice president and litigation counsel for CBS Records, said the 
company complied with every court order and was reviewing the Friday order to 
determine how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap's mother, Aunetta Roberson, said she was pleased that the judge found 
that the subliminal messages existed. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this case will cause other mothers to begin paying attention to what 
their kids are listening to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vance's mother, Phyllis Vance, said she is writing a book about the incident 
and intends to continue counseling families who have encountered problems 
allegedly due to heavy metal music. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to accept what the judge said," Vance said. "I was never in it for the 
money. My intention was to get the word out about heavy metal, and I plan to 
continue helping kids hurt by this music." 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented case, which sparked international attention, stemmed from the 
Dec. 23, 1985, suicide attempts of Belknap and Vance. 
</P>
<P>
After an afternoon of beer drinking, pot smoking and listening to Judas Priest 
music, the two youths demolished Belknap's bedroom, grabbed a 12-gauge 
sawed-off shotgun and jumped out the window . 
</P>
<P>
According to an account by Vance, Belknap dashed to the playground of a local 
church, sat down on a merry-go-round, jammed the muzzle of the weapon under his 
chin and pulled the trigger. Vance followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap died on the spot. Vance's self-inflicted blast tore away his nose, 
cheeks, jaw, tongue, teeth and gums. Horribly disfigured, he survived three 
years of excruciating plastic surgery before lapsing into an unexplained coma. 
He died in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In December 1985, Vance implied that the suicide attempts were a result of 
depression. He never mentioned Judas Priest's music, according to police 
reports. Vance told authorities that he shot himself out of panic, fearing that 
he would be blamed for his friend's shooting and might subsequently face arrest 
and prosecution, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
But in March 1986, Vance changed his story, according to police reports. He 
introduced the concept of a suicide pact and suggested that he believed a 
volatile combination of drugs, alcohol and Judas Priest music led the two to 
shoot themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Between March 1986 and October 1988, Vance cited specific lyrics from the song 
"Beyond the Realms of Death" as a motivating factor in the shootings, according 
to court records. 
</P>
<P>
When the parents of the dead youths first filed their case in 1986, they 
alleged that violent and suicidal themes present in "Realms" and other Judas 
Priest songs on the 1978 "Stained Class"album impelled their sons to attempt 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
But in October 1988 -- shortly after a similar suicide suit filed in Sacramento 
against rock star Ozzy Osbourne was dismissed by the California District Court 
of Appeals on the grounds that Osbourne's music and lyrics were protected by 
the First Amendment -- attorneys for the parents amended their original 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
They alleged that the specific subliminal command "Do it" had been embedded in 
a different Judas Priest song, "Better by You, Better Than Me," and that 
subliminal message, in combination with the record's allegedly overt violent 
and self-destructive imagery, precipitated the suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In a landmark 54-page ruling written last August and partially excerpted in 
Friday's ruling, Whitehead said that although the court respected the First 
Amendment right of artists to express themselves, he declined to dismiss the 
case because he believed that subliminal messages do not share such privileges. 
</P>
<P>
The judge suggested that subliminal communication is not protected because it 
does not advance any of the purposes of free speech and because it is a 
violation of privacy deviously employed to manipulate the subconscious mind. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial progressed, the plaintiffs also accused the band of inserting a 
broad array of backward slogans promoting suicide throughout the album. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Judas Priest argued that the shootings were motivated by a 
barrage of complex social and psychological problems -- including unstable 
family environments, poor academic performance, drug abuse and a history of 
violent and dysfunctional behavior -- which allegedly plagued the two young men 
since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Originally seeking $3.6 million in damages to compensate for the deaths, 
medical bills and support for a child Vance fathered after the suicide attempt, 
attorneys for the plaintiffs upped the ante to $6.2 million in their closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after a trial that lasted 17 days and included testimony from 
more than 40 witnesses, including psychologists, authors, lecturers, subliminal 
tape entrepreneurs and sound analysts.

BERKOFF'S 'RAMBO' AFTERLIFE: A DOCU-PLAY; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE PLAYWRIGHT-ACTOR-DIRECTOR'S 'ACAPULCO' IS BASED ON HIS EXPERIENCES 
FILMING 'RAMBO II.' IT OPENS TODAY AT THE ODYSSEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Walking through the airy lobby of the Odyssey Theatre, Steven Berkoff looks 
like he is ready for a fight. Short-statured and athletic, wearing garish 
warm-up pants popular with bodybuilders and a sleeveless black jacket, Berkoff 
suggests an urban warrior looking for turf violators. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as he lopes toward the theater space where his new play, "Acapulco," opens 
today, the British writer-director-actor is softly solicitous of a friend who 
has just finished watching a rehearsal. He asks him, with a tinge of 
self-doubt, about the work. The friend thinks Berkoff's staging of the play, 
set at an Acapulco bar and involving actors on location for "Rambo II," is 
going nicely. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have doubts whether or not I can pull off a show," he says, "because 
I don't work out a linear concept like other directors. As I go along, I 
develop the mise en scene, which is as important for me as the play. Whatever 
results, it won't be like any play anyone has ever seen before." 
</P>
<P>
If theater is a battle with long odds, short engagements and small budgets, 
Berkoff has been a feisty, sublime combatant. Critic Jack Kroll has called him 
"a one-man avant-garde." He is known as a writer of fluid, brilliant and fiery 
wordflows erupting lava-like out of his characters' mouths. He also has a 
reputation as a director who can lend those words extreme and precise 
physicality. And as an actor he has been cited for his unpredictable effects 
and demonic force. 
</P>
<P>
All of which sets him apart from other stage artists in Britain. And in 
America, for that matter, where he has been going through a strange, triple 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
He considers the Los Angeles stage his American base. With good reason. "Greek" 
at the Matrix in 1982 was universally acclaimed. He subsequently put his own 
stamp on Kafka's "Metamorphosis" at the Mark Taper Forum, Aeschylus' 
"Agamemnon" during the Olympic Arts Festival and "Decadence" at the old Pilot 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Kvetch's" engagement at the Odyssey is four years and counting. This year, 
"East" came to -- where else? -- the Odyssey (Berkoff calls it "my lab"), 
directed by longtime collaborator Barry Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, his New York adventures have been more precipitous: applause for 
his 1988 New York Shakespeare Festival version of "Coriolanus" and a 
"Metamorphosis" with Mikhail Baryshnikov, boos from New York critics for 
"Greek" and "Kvetch." 
</P>
<P>
Last, and least in Berkoff's mind, is his Hollywood work, which he has used for 
his own ends in "Acapulco." Remember the Soviet sadist who hot-wired Sylvester 
Stallone in "Rambo II"? Or Eddie Murphy's art dealer nemesis in "Beverly Hills 
Cop"? Or the operatic portrayal of Hitler in "War and Remembrance"? All of them 
were Berkoff as nasty as he wants to be -- or as much as movies and TV will let 
him be. 
</P>
<P>
"The movies are very useful, for they're my subsidies. Instead of getting money 
from an arts council, the film company says, 'Here's some money. Do a little 
bit and you can sit in your trailer and write your heart out.' " He wrote 
"Kvetch," for example, in his "Beverly Hills Cop" trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Berkoff calls "Acapulco" a chronicle, part-diary, part-reportage, of a time and 
place. It represents a new turn for a writer who has specialized in plays 
without sets or fixed locales, in which characters purge their souls through 
language. 
</P>
<P>
"Whereas 'Kvetch' is more an interior investigation of myself," he explains, " 
'Acapulco' was written as if it were a painted study of people's moods and 
spirits. This is the first time I've based a play upon a living experience." 
</P>
<P>
Berkoff, portraying the Soviet lieutenant in "Rambo II," went on location on 
Mexico's tropical Pacific coast near Acapulco as a stand-in for Vietnam. Most 
of the cast stayed at the Acapulco Plaza Hotel, and communed at the hotel bar 
after a day's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a creature from another planet. In the bar area, all these people 
talked about nothing but discos and food and the day's work and sex. Everything 
was based on primal, basic needs and emotions. I found them fascinating, 
charming, and I was envying their sensual needs and greeds, even though I'm 
more interested in concepts, in seeing Montezuma's tomb in Mexico City. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Explains this native of London's tough East End: "I tend to relate more to 
underdogs, not the stars . . . . I could have hung out with Stallone and the 
guys at his house watching tapes of Laker games, but I didn't. It was more 
interesting to hear how these 'ordinary folk,' with their peers, were able to 
fully express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Mentally recording the conversation, Berkoff would rush back to his hotel room 
and jot it down. As a play took shape, an outsider character emerged -- Berkoff 
himself: "Because I couldn't romanticize my own dialogue, I lifted passages 
from the journal I kept during my stay. Like all the dialogue in the play, 
nothing is invented." 
</P>
<P>
This journal has also appeared in England as a book, "Steven Berkoff's 
America," but it's not the only preview of "Acapulco" in print. The play was 
published by Grove Press (with "Kvetch") in 1987, when the Odyssey and Berkoff 
first tried to produce it. Each year since, "Acapulco" was announced, then 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a long time between the writing and putting them on the 
stage. I wrote 'West' in 1979, but didn't stage it until 1983. With 'Acapulco,' 
it was always scheduling conflicts." The strange effect of reading a play long 
before its world premiere is made stranger, since, with Berkoff's textual 
changes, the play in print won't always resemble the play on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Despite "Acapulco's" attempt at what Berkoff calls "documentary theater," he 
hasn't left behind his turbulent past work. "Fifteen years ago, I wrote a 
short-story collection about sexuality called 'Gross Intrusions.' It hits on 
the extremes of sex, coming from an impulse to write whatever came to me. It 
will be reprinted, though I had wondered if it should be. 
</P>
<P>
"But I realized that it should, since writing and sex have always been linked 
for me -- sex as a metaphor of rebellion. To describe the indescribable, the

MAHONY'S RELIGIOUS SUGGESTION TO JEWISH UNIONIST STIRS ANGER; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: ARCHBISHOP SAYS HE THOUGHT JACK SHEINKMAN WAS A CHRISTIAN. THEIR LETTERS 
HEAT UP A FEUD COMPLICATED BY THE ABORTION ISSUE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony has insisted that he did not know Jack 
Sheinkman is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
If he had, Mahony said recently, he would not have ended a letter to Sheinkman 
with the admonishment that he was "praying that the spirit of Jesus Christ 
might take deep root in your own life." 
</P>
<P>
But Mahony did, and a simmering feud over labor philosophy and abortion stances 
between the Los Angeles archbishop and Sheinkman, president of the 
200,000-member Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, has flared once 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based labor leader said he was angered by the religious suggestion 
in Mahony's May 21 letter. Sheinkman closed his June 5 response to Mahony by 
writing: "Perhaps you should . . . let the spirit of our common Judeo-Christian 
heritage take deep root in your own life." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his reference to Jesus Christ after Sheinkman recently made the 
correspondence public, Mahony said he thought Sheinkman was a German Christian 
name. "I know some people with that name who are German," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange of letters between the two mostly concerned a lingering dispute 
over efforts to organize gravediggers at the Los Angeles Archdiocese's 10 
cemeteries and their differing views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The volatile abortion issue has intensified a conflict between organized labor 
and Mahony -- an ongoing clash regretted by both sides because Mahony's support 
for farm workers in earlier years had made the prelate a hero to union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In his May 21 letter, Mahony said he looked forward to knowing the textile 
union's position on "the only vital and important issue of the day: the rights 
of the unborn to their human lives as created by God himself." 
</P>
<P>
Sheinkman's June 5 response challenged the archbishop's contention, referred to 
the gravediggers dispute and charged that Mahony had mocked past papal 
encyclicals on worker rights and had violated church teachings on unions. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony shot back in a June 18 letter that he was shocked at Sheinkman's 
"pro-abortion stance." And, if Sheinkman understood church teachings better, 
Mahony added, he would realize that the cemetery workers had voted at one point 
for union representation because of "lies, misinformation and threats made by 
your representatives." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said he was ending the correspondence "since your organization and the 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles share nothing in common." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship had already deteriorated badly when the textile workers union 
in February, 1989, narrowly won a vote to represent gravediggers at archdiocese 
cemeteries. Mahony objected, saying union organizers used intimidating tactics. 
Late last year an arbitration panel, selected by the archdiocese and the union, 
ruled 2 to 1 that the union should be the bargaining representative. 
</P>
<P>
But after only a few weeks of bargaining, the archdiocese discontinued 
negotiations and instead called a second election for cemetery workers on Feb. 
9, contending that the one-year agreement from the first vote had expired. That 
second election went solidly against the union, which refused to participate 
and sued to force Mahony to resume negotiating. The case is pending in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue also added to tensions, at first only subtly. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mahony and Patrick Henning, head of the layman-led Catholic Labor 
Institute, agreed to separate the decades-old Labor Day Mass and Breakfast in 
Los Angeles into two events on successive days. Both said the main reason was 
because the breakfast had become a heavily attended platform for politicians 
and the preceding Mass was lightly attended. 
</P>
<P>
But before that announcement, Mahony had written a scathing letter to Henning 
saying that neither he nor any auxiliary bishop would attend the breakfast 
co-sponsored "by the so-called 'Catholic' Labor Institute." Mahony wrote that 
the institute was a "hostile anti-Catholic union" and that there was "no 
redeeming value" in the Labor Day breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
In a later statement, the archbishop said that at one breakfast Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) "spoke most favorably for the right to abortion. I was 
stunned that he would come to a Catholic-sponsored event and support a position 
which is so morally repugnant to our Catholic beliefs and tradition." Mahony 
also objected to what he called the "pro-(Michael) Dukakis, anti-(George) Bush" 
flavor of the 1988 breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders, who have traditionally been courted by the Democratic Party, 
said Cranston had referred to abortion rights but the topic was not the subject 
of his talk. 
</P>
<P>
The recent clash between Mahony and Sheinkman also arose over abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Before its constitutional convention last fall, the AFL-CIO had come under 
pressure from several of its affiliates, including the textile workers union, 
to take a stand supporting abortion rights. But fearful of alienating some 
segments of its 14-million-worker membership, leaders of the labor federation 
referred the question to further study. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the AFL-CIO's executive council, made up of most of the 
presidents of the nation's large unions, voted overwhelmingly this month to 
remain neutral on abortion, leaving the question to be decided by individual 
unions and members. 
</P>
<P>
When the question was still unsettled last spring, Mahony had written letters 
to all members of the AFL-CIO's executive council, including Sheinkman, urging 
them not to adopt a stance favoring abortion rights, the archbishop said.

A U.S. Muslim leader says there is "a Judeo-Christian prejudice against Islam 
that tries to keep Islam outside the mainstream of American life." 
</P>
<P>
M. T. Mehdi, secretary-general of the National Council on Islamic Affairs, 
wrote identical letters to New York Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish 
leaders, charging Muslim exclusion from a Christian-Jewish radio program. 
</P>
<P>
He said religious discrimination in America first was against Catholics, then 
Jews and added: "Islam is the last monolithic religion coming to America and 
there is a Judeo-Christian pattern of prejudice and discrimination against 
Islam."

MODERATE SO. BAPTISTS TO STEER FUNDS TO LIKE-MINDED AGENCIES

<P>
Moderate Southern Baptists, feeling shut out of their own denomination, decided 
Friday to steer their money to agencies they support and away from those they 
see as aligned with fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,700-member group, Baptists Committed to the Southern Baptist Convention, 
voted to adopt an alternative funding plan that some observers said could be 
the first step toward forming a new denomination. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would bypass the 14.9-million-member denomination's unified budget by 
allowing donors to target specific church activities for funding. 
</P>
<P>
While affirming the new arrangement, leaders of the loosely organized moderate 
movement said they have no present plans for a new denomination. "We're here to 
help, not hurt; to heal, not wound; to unify, not divide; to focus on the 
future, not the past," said the Rev. Daniel Vestal, pastor of a suburban 
Atlanta church, during a keynote address on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The moderates have suffered 12 years of defeat in political infighting with the 
Southern Baptist's fundamentalist wing. The latest defeat came in June when 
Vestal was defeated by fundamentalist Morris Chapman of Ft. Worth for the 
convention presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting's sponsors oppose the direction the denomination has taken under 
conservative-dominated trustee boards. Conservative Southern Baptist leaders, 
meanwhile, have expressed concern that designated giving might weaken the 
official giving program. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman has joined top agency executives in defending the unified budget system 
and opposing "any deviation from this proven practice."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr., a central figure in the nation's savings and loan 
scandal, announced Friday that he resigned as chairman and chief executive of 
American Continental Corp., the Phoenix development company he formed in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation comes on the heels of recent stinging court setbacks for 
Keating, including a decision Thursday by U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin 
in Washington that upheld the government's seizure of Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan last year. Lincoln Savings had been owned by American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
American's other officers and directors resigned with Keating. 
</P>
<P>
"The company no longer has any officers and directors," said James Fedder, an 
outside attorney for American Continental, which has been operating in 
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from Keating, issued by Chicago attorney Stephen C. Neal, indicated 
that his move was sparked by Sporkin's ruling, which effectively cut short the 
66-year-old financier's effort to regain control of Lincoln. American 
Continental bought the thrift in 1984 for $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become clear that my client must now concentrate all his energy on 
aggressively defending the legal charges against him," Neal said. Federal 
banking regulators have filed civil racketeering charges against Keating for 
the way he ran Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal regulators Friday promised intensified enforcement action 
against lawyers, accountants, appraisers and other professionals who 
contributed to the collapse of savings and loan associations across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"No more vital question could be posed . . . (than) where were the 
professionals?" Harris Weinstein, chief counsel for the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
OTS officials said their efforts to punish the misdeeds of professionals were 
given a big boost by Sporkin's ruling. In denying Keating's efforts, Sporkin 
complained that lawyers and accountants approved numerous "clearly improper 
transactions" that contributed to Lincoln's $2-billion collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling applies strictly to Lincoln, OTS officials believe that the 
scathing criticism by Sporkin, a respected jurist and former enforcement chief 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will influence the legal and 
regulatory climate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased Judge Sporkin has identified an area which has concerned me 
since the day I walked into this job," said OTS Director T. Timothy Ryan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin, he said, "states our view, which you will see reflected in enforcement 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
OTS officials said the agency is conducting many detailed investigations that 
could lead to substantial fines or the banning of culpable lawyers and 
accountants from representing S&amp;Ls before the regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
Other federal agencies have filed suits seeking financial damages from lawyers 
and accountants who represented S&amp;Ls that collapsed into insolvency and 
were seized by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
But the OTS could go significantly further in punishing professional misdeeds. 
It could act to bar individuals or groups from representing any federally 
insured thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The professionals -- lawyers, accountants, appraisers and economists -- must 
share significant blame "in a great many thrift failures," Weinstein said. "We 
expect to move against those professionals in a vigorous way." 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein declined to discuss whether OTS is considering action against lawyers 
and accountants involved with Lincoln. But he said Keating, chairman of 
Lincoln's parent firm, "and his colleagues with the cooperation and assistance 
of their service providers, abused depositors and the American taxpayers to the 
tune of tens of millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein said professionals played an important role in Lincoln's misdeeds: 
Accountants treated sham transactions as real sales, and lawyers threatened 
personal damage suits against federal regulatory officials to inhibit them from 
taking action against the troubled S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, what was done couldn't have been done without the help of the 
professionals," Weinstein said. "Highly sophisticated transactions are very 
unlikely to be done without the assistance of professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein added economists to the list of professionals who contributed to 
thrift problems. In some cases, he said, economists advised thrift managers on 
highly sophisticated, highly risky methods of computerized securities trading. 
The economists could be held accountable if they failed to disclose the true 
extent of the risk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Lincoln, which was burdened by a portfolio of bad real estate 
investments, will ultimately cost taxpayers $2 billion. The figure includes 
expenses associated with paying off depositors, whose accounts are insured up 
to $100,000, and selling unprofitable assets. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Sporkin said the government was justified in its seizure of 
Lincoln last year and rejected Keating's challenge of the takeover. He said 
Keating and other top executives "abused their positions" through behavior that 
"amounted to a looting of Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin's ruling Thursday was the second court setback for Keating in two days. 
On Wednesday, a federal judge partially froze Keating's assets and required him 
to disclose his personal finances to government regulators within five days. 
Keating, reportedly worth $39 million in 1987, now claims that he is broke.

BUSINESS COPES AS HIGHER FUEL COSTS AFFECT MANY FIRMS

<P>
The impact of soaring crude oil prices has begun to flow to a wide variety of 
businesses, ranging from Marina Del Rey roofers to Pittsburgh glass and paint 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, manufacturing and service companies have not yet raised prices 
but are poised to do so if energy costs remain at current levels -- still above 
$30 a barrel -- or climb even higher as a result of the turmoil in the Mideast. 
Other businesses -- faced with stiff competition -- have changed their 
operations to cut energy use in hopes of avoiding hiking prices. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that use petrochemicals to make a wide range of consumer and 
industrial products have been stung by oil price rises. For example, Dow 
Chemical Co., based in Midland, Mich., uses large amounts of ethane and propane 
to make plastics. "When the price of oil rises, so does the price of ethane and 
propane," said company spokesman Gordon Butte. 
</P>
<P>
Dow has raised the price it charges for one plastic -- polyethylene, used in 
packaging materials or grocery sacks -- by 5 cents a pound, or about 10%. Butte 
said Dow normally raises polyethylene prices only 1 or 2 cents per pound when 
its costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
"If oil prices stay at a high level, it will have a dramatic effect on 
manufacturing costs and . . . you're probably going to see prices going up," 
Butte said. 
</P>
<P>
At Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries, makers of paint and glass products, the 
cost of some oil-based solvents has risen, said spokesman John Ruch. The 
company has also seen a rise in the cost of transporting its products, but PPG 
has not yet been forced to raise prices, Ruch said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really too early for us to define the effects of the (new) costs," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tire makers also have watched rising fuel prices with concern. "Our raw 
materials are going up, and if things keep going up, we will definitely be 
raising prices," said Hank Ruppel of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., which uses 
petrochemicals to make synthetic rubber for its tires. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California roofers are feeling the strain of rising prices for 
oil-based tar and asphalt roofing materials. Mike Jones of United Roofing in 
Los Angeles said his company has had to raise prices 7% and will honor the 
prices in its estimates for only two weeks instead of the normal two months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a daily thing," Jones said of rising prices for roofing materials. 
"Now suppliers are not telling me what (the price increase) is going to be. 
They just raise it." 
</P>
<P>
Roofer Al Ayala in Marina Del Rey faces the prospect of raising prices when he 
restocks supplies. "The supplies are OK this month," said Ayala, who purchased 
his current inventory of materials before prices began rising two weeks ago. 
But "the next time I load up on material, I will probably have to raise my 
prices 10%. We couldn't eat that increase." 
</P>
<P>
Airlines, trucking companies, railroads and steamship lines have also raised 
prices to help cover higher fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
Steamship lines have been hardest hit, as a doubling in the price of fuel oil 
has wiped out any profit for August. "I talked to one executive who said it 
cost $1 million to fuel his ships during the first two weeks of August. That is 
a huge number," said Ron Gottshall, executive director of the Transpacific 
Westbound Rate Agreement, a price-setting body whose members include the 
largest steamship lines. 
</P>
<P>
The transpacific shippers, including Oakland-based American President Lines, 
have announced a 10% fuel surcharge effective Sept. 7 to help compensate for 
the rapid increase in costs. 
</P>
<P>
The railroads and the trucking firms also have announced fuel surcharges 
ranging from 1.5% to 4% of their rates to cover a 50% jump in the cost of 
diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Air cargo firms also have raised prices to cover spiraling jet fuel costs, 
which have risen 20 cents a gallon since the end of July for some air carriers. 
Burlington Air Express of Irvine raised its rates by 6 cents a pound, and 
United Airlines will add a 5.3% surcharge on domestic freight beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms have changed operations to cut costs rather than raise prices in the 
face of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Dispatchers for Airport Flyer Express, an L.A. airport shuttle service, have 
tried to make sure the company's 25 vans run fully loaded to deal with a 
10-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline. Said manager Dave Manfull: "If (fuel costs) 
continued to go up this way, we obviously will have to increase our prices or 
place a surcharge. That would be the last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Many businesses have become more energy-efficient over the years and are better 
prepared to weather high fuel prices. During the 1973-74 oil embargo, for 
example, attendance at Disney World and Disneyland declined nearly 6.5%, 
according to Jessica Reif, an entertainment industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Walt Disney Co. more heavily promotes its theme parks to local residents, 
said a Disneyland spokesman. Disneyland also uses vehicles powered by natural 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, petroleum costs have declined for many record companies because 
compact discs require fewer oil-based products than vinyl LPs, according to Jim 
Frische, president of Digital Audio Disc Corp. of Terre Haute, Ind., a Sony 
Corp. unit that is the nation's largest producer of compact discs.

Profit taking drove crude oil and gasoline futures prices down sharply Friday, 
but a new survey showed that prices at the corner gasoline station have jumped 
to their highest levels since Independence Day, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday, pump prices had risen to an average of $1.274 a gallon nationally 
for self-serve unleaded regular gasoline, a sharp 3.7-cent increase over 
Monday's figure and up 19.9 cents since Aug. 1, the day before the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait, according to a survey by the American Automobile Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were highest in the West, where they averaged $1.359 a gallon, and 
lowest in the Mid-Atlantic states, where they averaged $1.236, according to the 
survey of about 5,000 stations. California averaged $1.316 a gallon, a 
17.7-cent increase since July 4, the last time the association surveyed 
California prices. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry officials said the sharp increases reflect companies' attempts to 
avoid runaway demand by middlemen and motorists, the increasingly high 
replacement cost of crude oil and the high price of gasoline on spot markets. 
</P>
<P>
But a consumer group repeated charges that the price increases reflect simple 
greed by oil companies eager to reap windfall profits from the current Middle 
East crisis -- charges that industry officials denied. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, meanwhile, crude oil and gasoline futures 
prices were way off after reaching record highs a day earlier, as traders took 
profits before the weekend amid continuing uncertainty about political and 
military events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of a strange day," said Kevin M. Kelly, manager of futures 
trading for Chevron Corp.'s international oil company in San Francisco. "The 
mood of the day was simply profit taking in the absence of any substantial news 
in a market that was already quite long." 
</P>
<P>
The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade of 
crude oil, closed at $30.91 a barrel, a drop of $1.02. Unleaded gasoline for 
September delivery closed at $1.0466, down 3.89 cents from its record level 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, oil prices finished at their highest levels since 1983. At one 
point Thursday, the October contract traded at $32.35 a barrel, equal to the 
all-time high reached Aug. 2, 1983. In the last week, gasoline futures have 
been closing at their highest levels since trading began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Trading throughout the day was volatile. Prices went down immediately after the 
opening but rose at various points on word of refinery problems at Lyondell 
Petrochemical Co.'s Houston refinery and a false rumor that President Bush had 
suffered a stroke, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were ultimately driven down partly in response to the drop on London 
markets, where traders cashed out their positions in anticipation of a British 
three-day holiday weekend. Some fears may have eased on news that Iraq had 
pulled back elite troops from the border with Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Prices also fell on prospects for a meeting Sunday by some members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss boosting production 
quotas to offset the shortfall in world crude oil supplies resulting from the 
international embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude, some traders said. 
</P>
<P>
But other traders discounted the OPEC news. It was not clear Friday how many 
OPEC members will actually attend the meeting, or whether any useful agreement 
will come of it. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, traders agreed that Friday's price drop was likely to be 
temporary, given continuing anxiety about the Iraqi situation, and that prices 
could zoom up again Monday if the Middle East heats up over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The market's really still trading very much on news," said Tom Bentz, director 
of futures trading at United Energy Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices could resume their upward trajectory if continuing refinery 
problems threaten to constrain gasoline supplies. The automobile association 
reported Friday that gasoline supplies remain adequate for now. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, a unit at the Lyondell refinery in Houston was shut down after a 
line ruptured and spewed a nontoxic catalyst into the air. 
</P>
<P>
No fire was reported, but the unit -- which each day processes about 90,000 
barrels of heavy fuel oils into light petroleum products, mainly gasoline -- 
will be closed for about 10 days. That will reduce the refinery's total 
production of gasoline by about a third, said David Harpole, a spokesman for 
Lyondell, which is 49.9% owned by Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Chevron said it would take down a catalytic cracker unit at its 
El Segundo refinery for routine maintenance for three weeks beginning Sept. 7. 
The unit normally makes about 40,000 barrels of gasoline a day. But a spokesman 
said supplies of gasoline have already been stockpiled to tide the refinery 
over.

DOW CLIMBS 49.50 IN LARGEST GAIN SINCE IRAQ INVASION

<P>
Stock prices reversed course Friday and had the biggest rally since Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait, although traders were cautious about predicting a 
definitive end to the huge selloff that on Thursday had brought stock averages 
to their lowest levels in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index climbed 49.50 points Friday, or 2%, to close at 
2,532.92. But the Dow still showed a net loss for the week of 111.88 points, or 
4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the rally mainly to technical factors, such as short 
covering, and to modestly encouraging news, such as a dip Friday in oil prices. 
Few predicted a sustained rally. But some said stock prices may now bottom out. 
</P>
<P>
"Stocks are really deeply, deeply oversold on a short-term basis," said Bill 
Raftery, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. Extreme 
nervousness over the Middle East situation may have sent prices down too far. 
</P>
<P>
John Burnett, a trader at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities, said 
there "is a perception that the selling over the past several sessions has 
discounted everything but the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
The bond market, still wracked by fears about oil prices and the Persian Gulf 
situation, finished one of the worst weeks since the stock market crash three 
years ago with another plunge on Friday. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond, 
a sensitive indicator of trends in interest rates, fell 7/32 of a point, or 
about $2.19 per $1,000 in face amount. Its loss for the week was more than $22. 
The bond's yield reached 9.15%, the highest since April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In stock trading, the over-the-counter market also rallied strongly, although 
OTC stocks had been hit the hardest by the recent selloff. The NASDAQ 
over-the-counter composite index was up 7.11, or 2%, to close at 367.33. 
</P>
<P>
On the Big Board, 943 stocks rose while 643 fell. Volume, although heavy at 
199.04 million shares, was less than the 250.44 million shares that changed 
hands during Thursday's selloff. "I don't think that can be good news," said 
Jeff Kaminsky, a stock trader at Mabon, Nugent in New York. "I would much 
rather see strong volume on the way up than on the way down." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's rally followed gains in major foreign stock markets, including Tokyo 
and London. The Nikkei Stock Average closed up 428.13 at 24,165.76, a 1.8% 
rise. In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 11.4 
points, at 2,086.4. In Frankfurt, the German DAX index rose 38.70 points, or 
2.6%, to close at 1,559.04. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that although the situation around the Persian Gulf remains 
extremely tense, with Iraqi soldiers surrounding Western embassies in Kuwait, 
the lack of other major developments was interpreted as an encouraging sign. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as another weekend of extreme uncertainty approached, both the 
dollar and gold prices rose. After falling Thursday to new lows against the 
German mark, the British pound and the Swiss franc, the dollar started off by 
gaining ground in Asian markets and continued to rise in trading in Europe and 
then the United States. In U.S. trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.557 German 
marks, up from 1.548 on Thursday. The dollar was at 1.268 Swiss Francs, up from 
1.2598. The dollar rose to 146.47 yen, up from 145.88. 
</P>
<P>
After trading lower overseas, gold rose on the New York Commodity Exchange to 
settle at $415 an ounce, up $3 an ounce from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices retreated somewhat from the level reached Thursday, which was the 
highest in seven years. The U.S. benchmark price for West Texas Intermediate 
crude ended down $1.02 at $30.91 a barrel for October delivery. Analysts 
attributed the relatively steep one-day drop to profit taking by oil traders. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rosen, a bond trader at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, said he 
expects bond prices to continue to fall, in response to concerns about the 
impact of rising oil prices and potential hostilities in the Middle East. He 
said that some economic fundamentals point to a lowering of bond yields. But he 
said, "You can throw fundamental analysis out the window right now, especially 
as tensions (in the Middle East) escalate." 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* The rally was fueled by heavy buying of blue-chip growth stocks that had 
taken a beating in recent sessions. Boeing jumped 3 3/8 to 45 7/8, GE gained 3 
to 61 1/2, IBM rose 3 1/2 to 100 3/8, Home Depot added 2 5/8 to 31 1/4, Disney 
soared 2 3/4 to 97 7/8 and Wal-mart rose 1 3/8 to 26 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks plunged anew. Arco tumbled 3 5/8 to 134 7/8, Unocal dropped 1/2 to 
31 1/8 and Chevron lost 1 3/8 to 74 1/4. However, the oil-service group, hit by 
profit taking on Wednesday, rebounded. Halliburton rose 1 3/8 to 52 and Baker 
Hughes added 7/8 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
* Tech stocks were clearly targeted by bargain-hunters. Conner Peripherals 
jumped 1 1/2 to 22 1/4, Intel soared 2 3/4 to 36 and Autodesk leaped 2 7/8 to 
47 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Big gainers among Southland stocks included Fluor, up 4 to 35 1/2, Jacobs 
Engineering, up 2 to 17 1/2, Amgen, up 2 5/8 to 44, and MCA, up 2 5/8 to 41 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall rally, prices of utility stocks fell. The Dow utilities 
average fell 0.75 to 190.96. Doris Kelley-Alston, a utilities analyst at 
Merrill Lynch, noted that utility stocks move closely with interest rates. She 
said that when the prices of Treasury bonds started to give way Friday, "We saw 
it reflected in the electric utility industry."

Gulf Fears Beat Bond Prices Down 
</P>
<P>
Bond strategists said prices strengthened early Friday on internal market 
technical influences and the Commerce Department's gross national product 
report, which showed the economy grew by only 1.2% in the April-June quarter, 
less than many forecasters had envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
The GNP report suggested serious economic problems confronted the United States 
that required the need for lower interest rates, which tends to boost the value 
of bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
But the effect of the statistic quickly faded and prices fell as investors 
refocused attention on rapid developments in the Persian Gulf, where a showdown 
loomed between U.S. and Iraqi forces over Iraq's seizure of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8.063% late Thursday.

Dollar Ends Week on High Note Again

The dollar repeated what is becoming a usual Friday performance -- rising ahead 
of an uncertain weekend in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
After falling in the previous session to new lows against the German mark, the 
Swiss franc and the British pound, the dollar was ripe for a technical rebound. 
It began rising in Asian trading and continued to gain ground when activity 
shifted to Europe and the United States.

Cattle Futures Dip on Fears of Slump 
</P>
<P>
Cattle futures prices slipped Friday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange under 
continuing fears of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, oil prices turned lower; soybeans and wheat advanced; corn 
was lower, and gold posted some minor gains. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle futures settled 0.25 to 0.75 cent lower, with the contract for delivery 
in October at 76.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.55 cent to 1.15 cents 
lower, with August at 88.17 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 0.33 cent 
higher, with October at 48.42 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.82 
cents lower to 0.30 cent higher, with August at 41.90 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Precious-metals futures erased losses and notched small gains on the Commodity 
Exchange in New York. Gold settled $2.80 to $3.60 higher, with the December 
contract at $423.20 an ounce; silver was 6 to 7.9 cents higher, with August at 
$5.187 an ounce.

GE Cuts Jobs in Massachusetts, Alabama: General Electric Co. said it would cut 
the jobs due to a shrinking military budget. 
</P>
<P>
GE Aerospace said it would eliminate 650 jobs in Burlington, Mass., by 1992 and 
will close a facility in Huntsville, Ala., by the end of next year. The Alabama 
site employs 400 people, and about half the workers will be offered jobs in 
Daytona Beach, Fla., under a consolidation plan, said a GE spokesman. Products 
at the Burlington plant include automated test equipment for such military 
vehicles as tanks and helicopters. Huntsville has served as a development site 
for an electronic test system for the Navy.

Baxter Will Sell Stake in Biotech Firm: Baxter International has been a 
long-time investor in Genetics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., holding 7% of the 
shares, but said it will sell all or part of the stake to raise money for debt 
reduction. Analysts believe that the stock sale does not reflect any 
displeasure on Baxter's part with the smaller company, with whom it has a joint 
program to develop and market a drug to treat hemophilia. Baxter stock rose 
$1.25 per share to close at $23 on the New York Stock Exchange; on NASDAQ, 
Genetics Institute closed down $2 to $27.25.

Mediterranean winds Friday fanned the flames of France's worst forest fires in 
26 years, killing one person and threatening several towns. 
</P>
<P>
Flames up to 65 feet high have roared out of control, burning more than 32,000 
acres of southern France since Tuesday. A lack of rain and high winds have 
hampered the effort to control the flames. 
</P>
<P>
A long, dry spell and the steep mountain slopes also have made controlling the 
fires difficult for the 2,000 firefighters and the pilots dropping thousands of 
gallons of water on the blazes.

BONUS PAY FOR PRINCIPALS TO GET TAX HIKE ALLEGED; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: INVESTIGATORS SAY CAPISTRANO TRUSTEES OKD A SECRET INCENTIVE PLAN TO 
BUILD UP VOTE ON MEASURE A.

<P>
The Capistrano Unified School District approved a secret "bonus incentive plan" 
for its school principals who could produce in their areas the necessary 
two-thirds vote needed to approve a special tax, county prosecutors alleged in 
court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also produced documents showing that district officials kept the 
bonus plan hidden from them during an investigation last year into possible 
misuse of public funds in promoting Measure A, the May, 1989, districtwide 
ballot initiative. However, no charges have been filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A, which would have raised property taxes for new school construction, 
failed to get the required two-thirds vote it needed for passage, despite heavy 
political backing from the school district. The vote tally was 52.2% in favor 
to 47.8% opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon on Friday ordered the Capistrano 
district to turn over to prosecutors all files related to its closed-door 
sessions for the first half of 1989. The judge also denied a request from the 
school district's attorneys that all court records on the case be sealed from 
public view "because of the sensitive nature of the material." 
</P>
<P>
The records show that in September, 1989, district officials turned over to 
county prosecutors minutes of the March 6, 1989, closed-door session in which a 
consultant was hired for the Measure A special tax election. But it was not 
until February, 1990, after a persistent inquiry from Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Wallace J. Wade and his investigators, that a new set of minutes was sent to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The new set of minutes included the bonus payment plan, which was not detailed 
in minutes previously released to prosecutors. Wade said his office is 
investigating the discrepancy between the two documents. 
</P>
<P>
The Capistrano district, the fifth largest in the county, covers San Juan 
Capistrano, Capistrano Beach, Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel, San Clemente and 
Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said his office is not yet prepared to say whether the bonus plan was 
illegal. But he cited a state Education Code statute that prohibits "change in 
compensation" to school employees for purposes of influencing the outcome of an 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a general rule (in the state Education Code) that public funds should 
not be used for political purposes," Wade said. "When we get a set of minutes 
that show one thing and a new set of minutes five months later showing bonuses 
we had not been told about, it certainly makes us want to take a hard look at 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Annette B. Gude, president of the district's Board of Trustees, said Friday 
that the trustees had been advised by lawyers that the bonus plan was legal. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told (the principals) could get involved because it was something to 
benefit the schools," said Gude, who was not the board president at the time 
the bonus plan was approved. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, the plan was approved at a closed-door session in 
which neither the minutes nor the votes taken were made public. Gude said the 
agenda for the closed session was cleared by district lawyers prior to the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Wade disagreed in court papers. "In the opinion of the district attorney's 
office, the school board met on at least (these) closed-door-session items 
improperly," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
District papers turned over to prosecutors also showed that school district 
Supt. Jerome R. Thornsley wrote to the trustees at the time: "If the board 
approves (the incentives), there would be strong admonishment (to the 
principals) not to make it a matter of public record." 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley also sought approval from the trustees to tell the school principals 
"that should the incentive-pay issue become public and cause any problem prior 
to the election, the follow-through would simply not take place (final board 
approval of the plan)," according to the court documents. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "This would put the responsibility on each principal to keep the 
matter confidential." 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley was unavailable Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said his office began investigating the election after some citizens 
complained about school officials pressuring them to vote yes on Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
Gude said some principals did receive bonuses, but only for encouraging parents 
to vote in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Some principals worked very hard and put in extra time, and we felt they 
needed to be rewarded," Gude said. "The stress was: It's important for you to 
go out and vote." Gude denied that principals were instructed to urge parents 
to vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
However, the school district's minutes from a March 6 closed-door session state 
that the trustees voted "unanimously to authorize the superintendent to 
recommend (principals) for incentive stipends during 1989 as a result of (them) 
achieving 66 2/3 'yes' votes in their areas." 
</P>
<P>
Although the minutes do not specify the amount of the bonuses, district 
documents reveal that Thornsley recommended to the trustees that they either 
pay 5% of a principal's annual salary or a flat fee of $2,500. Salaries of 
school principals countywide last year ranged from $38,300 to $65,400, 
according to the County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said his investigation will try to determine whether the bonuses and fees 
paid to a consulting firm hired to promote the measure were legal. 
Investigators also will look into possible civil or criminal violations under 
the state's Ralph M. Brown Act, which requires that trustees make public the 
results of voting held in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't saying at this point that anyone has done anything criminally 
wrong," Wade said. "It certainly appears there were some kind of violations of 
the Brown Act. But we're still investigating." 
</P>
<P>
Michael McShane, a Sacramento attorney hired to represent the district, accused 
Wade in court papers of "pestering" the district for 17 months "in hopes of 
finding some evidence to support his theories." McShane called Wade's inquiry 
"a fishing expedition" and said there was no wrongdoing by district officials. 
</P>
<P>
District President Gude said Friday that "all of this is just driving us up the 
wall. So far, they haven't charged us with anything. We keep saying, 'If you've 
got something, charge us with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Benecke, chairwoman of a political action committee formed to campaign 
for Measure A, said the PAC was formed because she understood that school 
employees could not work for the measure during regular working hours. But in 
the off-hours, she said, principals "have the right . . . to encourage people 
to vote yes." 
</P>
<P>
However, the issue is not the principals' right to campaign, Wade said. The 
issue is whether the trustees had the right to spend public money to get them 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said that his investigation would not be taking so long had the district 
cooperated in the beginning. He pointed out in court papers that for months 
Thornsley and the district trustees refused to even be questioned on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the school district's lawyers informed Wade that they would not 
voluntarily turn over to his office the minutes and other memos related to 
closed-door sessions that he requested. Wade, in turn, sought a court order for 
those documents Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While the bonuses may draw the most attention, the district attorney's 
investigation goes to the general question of whether the district should have 
campaigned for the passage of Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the state Fair Political Practices Commission, Thornsley 
insisted that the literature and other district efforts were only designed to 
get out the vote, not support a 'yes' vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Wade said the literature contradicts that intention. He noted that the FPPC 
wrote back to Thornsley saying that most of the district's money spent on the 
election should have been reported as political funds, which the district then 
filed.

HIGH SCHOOL BAND GETS NEW DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERYLANNE BEALER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just two weeks after a whirlwind tour of Europe, including performances at a 
music festival in Geneva, the El Toro High Marching Band was already back at 
work this week, sweating in the August heat in their heavy navy blue uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
The summer's accomplishment puts them among the top high school bands in the 
nation. It was the only high school band to perform at the American Bowl in 
London, England's yearly exhibition of professional U.S. football. And they so 
impressed the crowd in Geneva that spectators were running alongside the band, 
cheering, during parades, band members said. 
</P>
<P>
But the hallmark trip had a bittersweet taste for the 104-member unit. It 
marked the last time that band members would work with director Pat Rainer, who 
had led the band for the past 10 years. Rainer resigned in July after district 
officials notified her that she would be transferred out of El Toro High to 
teach elementary school. She accompanied the band on the August trip because it 
had been arranged almost a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Rainer's transfer last April sparked an outcry from 
parents, who filed a formal complaint against the school's principal and 
lobbied the school board about the action. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents, still upset, plan to appear at the school board's Sept. 11 
meeting to demand comment from the school board. The matter, conducted during 
closed session because it was a personnel item, was never publicly discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel this is right. We just want an answer," said Deni Richardson, a 
parent of a band member. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is district policy not to include booster groups on policy 
decisions, Richardson said she thought boosters need to have more say in 
administrative decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Don Martin said he requested Rainer's transfer partly because of 
"personality conflicts" with the football staff. In one instance, the band 
missed a CIF playoff game to appear at a competition in Santa Barbara. The 
band's appearance at the competition was sanctioned by Martin, but it later 
caused discord. The campus newspaper editorialized against the band and band 
members allegedly were harassed on campus. In response to that, parents angrily 
called the administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected a backlash (after requesting the transfer), but I thought it was in 
the best interest of the band and the entire school," Martin said. "When you're 
successful, the important thing to do is work together, rather than work 
separately." 
</P>
<P>
And although parents are still irked over what happened to Rainer, most are 
ready to accept her replacement, 25-year-old Tom Verrier, a former band leader 
at Pioneer High School in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very positive about Verrier, despite everything that happened. He's got 
some great ideas," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
As they practiced Friday, band members seemed eager to begin a new season as 
they listened to their new director. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real enthusiastic, but he's different," drum major Mike Esperanza said. 
"You just have to get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to have an even better year," junior Danny Methe said. "It 
just depends on how people work together." 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of practice, the teacher Friday already had passed his first 
obstacle: sharing the school's two practice fields with the football team. 
</P>
<P>
"We coordinated what times we would use it, what times they would use it. . . . 
It didn't seem to be a problem," he said. "We're (eager) to support the 
football team." CHERYLANNE BEALER

WORKERS PREPARE TO MOVE PIER BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Workers on Friday began dismantling the foundations of three buildings on the 
city pier, preparing the structures to be moved next week to a city storage 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
The snack stands and bait shop, built in the 1930s, will be stored while the 
pier is demolished and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Demolition gets under way next month. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, however, say it is unlikely that the former Bait and Tackle Shop, 
Captain's Locker and Neptune's Locker will be used on the new pier. The city's 
Pier Design Committee, a City Council advisory board, says the buildings are 
too timeworn to be used on the new structure. 
</P>
<P>
But if the city demolishes the three shops, it may risk losing a $1.3-million 
federal grant for rebuilding the 76-year-old landmark, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement among the city, state and federal agencies upon which the 
grant hinges, the city must make every effort to incorporate the look of the 
historic pier into the design of the new one. So if the city destroys pier 
buildings that are deemed historically significant, it may be in violation of 
that pact, Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After the buildings are moved to the city yard, inspectors will be hired to 
determine what historic value, if any, the buildings possess. The city's 
Historic Resources Board, which originally opposed the demolition of the pier, 
is now pushing to preserve the snack stands and bait shop. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than delay the 18-month pier reconstruction project any further, the 
City Council agreed last month to pay a Garden Grove firm $26,500 to move the 
buildings until the issue over their historic value is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the new pier is expected to get under way in November. City 
officials are targeting March, 1992, as its opening date. JOHN PENNER

ERSKINE QUESTIONS PLAN-CHECKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after the City Council imposed a substantial new plan-checking fee 
for all building renovations and new construction, Councilman John Erskine is 
calling for his colleagues to reconsider their decision. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine said that letters of protest he received from the Chamber of Commerce 
and a major developer prompted him to second-guess the council's approval of 
the new charge, although he is not yet reversing his support of the fee. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of dozens of new fees and cost hikes that the council, including 
Erskine, approved Aug. 6 to make charges for the processing services equal to 
what it costs officials to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
The fee being challenged, similar to charges levied by some other Orange County 
cities, is expected to bring the city an extra $500,000 in revenue this year. 
It adds onto planning and permit costs a processing charge equal to 0.3% of the 
assessed value of the work being done. 
</P>
<P>
For a 400-square-foot room addition, the new fee will be about $75. Other 
construction-related fees total $335. 
</P>
<P>
But Erskine said he is concerned over what the charge adds to larger projects, 
such as The Waterfront, a seaside residential and hotel resort. 
</P>
<P>
The first hotel of the project opened last month, but most of the other 
facilities are still in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine, referring to a letter he received from Steven Bone, developer of The 
Waterfront, said that Bone expressed concern about the added cost that the fee 
would generate, specifically ". . . a couple of hundred thousand dollars onto 
the next Waterfront hotel." 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce letter did not specifically denounce the new planning 
charge, but only asked that the council "be equitable and fair to the entire 
business community." 
</P>
<P>
No date has yet been set for the council to reconsider the adopted processing 
fee. JOHN PENNER

CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO GET AN ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga's reorganization of his 
office, an administrative position is being added to the city's 
upper-management team. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant city administrator position is being created to help the chief 
executive coordinate and monitor city programs and projects. 
</P>
<P>
The new assistant administrator, to be hired by December, also will act as city 
administrator if Uberuaga is absent or otherwise unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Uberuaga said the new post will improve city management by freeing him from 
many internal chores so that he can concentrate on major policy issues, 
managing the budget and working with the City Council, department managers, the 
community and other governmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Council members this week said they strongly support the realignment, the 
latest in a series of sweeping changes Uberuaga has imposed since taking over 
as city administrator in February. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant city administrator will be paid $67,000 in salary and benefits 
during the 1990-91 fiscal year, according to a report prepared by Uberuaga's 
office. The money will come from $90,000 the city is scheduled to receive this 
year from the developer of the planned Bolsa Chica housing project as 
reimbursement for Deputy City Administrator Jim Palin's work on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant city administrator position will replace Palin's job, which also 
includes acting as zoning administrator, when Palin retires in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Palin is one of four deputy city administrators assigned to specific managerial 
duties. None of the other three positions will change with the staff 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Palin has been devoted mainly to planning the Bolsa Chica 
development. The new administrator's duties will include overseeing the new 
pier's design, the water-saving plan and the Huntington Central Library 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting of candidates will start next month. JOHN PENNER

PROGRAM RECYCLES SLUDGE AS FERTILIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fertilizer truck delivering piles of recycled sewage to homeowners? 
</P>
<P>
That may sound far-fetched to some people, but not to Bill Becker, general 
manager of the Southeast Regional Reclamation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Becker is considering what could happen as a result of a pilot program now 
being conducted by the 12 member districts of the reclamation authority and the 
Aliso Water Management Agency. The program involves testing a mixture of sewer 
sludge and sawdust in experimental compost piles at Rancho Mission Viejo. The 
process could eventually allow Orange County sanitation agencies to enter the 
fertilizer market. 
</P>
<P>
"Our trucks could follow the trash trucks and fill the empty trash cans part 
way with fertilizer that homeowners could use," Becker said. "That way we could 
recycle the material to residents in their empty trash cans instead of taking 
it to a landfill." 
</P>
<P>
Sewer sludge is composed of the raw solids left after sewage is treated. Each 
person produces about a pound of sludge a day, Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
For the composting, two parts of sawdust are mixed with one part sludge and 
heated in the sun to produce a useful fertilizer that is relatively odorless, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most county reclamation facilities now either dump sewer sludge into landfills 
or pay to have it trucked to sites as far away as Utah to be used in 
fertilizers, Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said the Orange County program is modeled after one in Los Angeles 
County, where sanitation districts use a 20-acre compost site in Carson and 
work with a contractor, Kellogg's Nitrohumus Co., to distribute the material. 
</P>
<P>
A site of about 3 acres in Chiquita Canyon is being used for the Orange County 
pilot program, and the Chino-Corona Nursery will test-market the material, 
Becker said. LEN HALL

COUNCIL TO ASSIST IN SAVING CREEK BED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents hoping to preserve Santiago Creek's bed as a strip of parkland moved 
a step closer to their goal this week when the City Council agreed to help 
research ways to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
In response to public protest, the council rejected a developer's proposal 
earlier this month to turn 37 acres of open space into a planned community and 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Santiago Creek Greenway Committee, a coalition of 
environmentalists and residents, have gained the council's support for an 
alternate plan to turn the site of the former Santiago Golf Course into a 
public park. 
</P>
<P>
Howard DeCruyenaere told the council that millions of dollars are available to 
"encourage stewardship and maintenance of streams by the community." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, municipal participation is needed to apply for grants through 
the Parkland Preservation Bond Act, the Urban Stream Restoration Project of the 
California Department of Water Resources and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Council members agreed to provide staff support and "petty cash" to hire a 
consultant, on condition that Lynn Burnett, an official of the Burnett Ehline 
Development Co. and part owner of the property, be included in all discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to report its findings in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
While Burnett has not announced plans for the property, he has said he will 
consider selling it to the residents and the city. MARY HELEN BERG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RESERVES WILL KEEP SCHOOLS IN THE BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Habra City School District will operate in the black this year, despite 
reduced revenues from the state lottery and increased costs for energy, health 
insurance and employee pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The school board voted this week to approve an $18-million budget for the 
fiscal year ending in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The spending plan requires, however, that the district use more than $500,000 
from its reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before have we been hit with such an avalanche of lower income and 
greater expense," Supt. Richard Hermann said. "There are a couple of twists to 
this year's budget situation that I've never experienced before." 
</P>
<P>
Hermann was particularly disturbed by a fee estimated at more than $100,000 
that may be assessed by the county for collecting district property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fee amounts to "double taxation." 
</P>
<P>
The budget anticipates continued growth in enrollment. Hermann told the board 
he expects daily attendance to climb by 51 students. The new total will be 
4,525 students attending the district's seven elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
The budget provides $400,000 for employee pay increases but does not allow for 
a cost-of-living adjustment. Negotiations regarding more raises are under way 
with the teachers union and other district employees. State lottery revenues 
for last year were nearly $700,000. Hermann said that amount will drop during 
the current fiscal year, but he is not sure by how much. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly seven-eighths of the budget goes for employee pay and benefits. Hermann 
said any savings must come from other areas, including supplies, operating 
expenses and capital outlay. DAVID F. BURKE

CAROUSEL FANS RIDE IN FOR AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON SAMUELS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marianne Stevens has fond memories of the old carousel ride at Coney Island. 
</P>
<P>
She loved the delicately carved wooden horses with shiny glass black eyes. And 
today, more than 30 years later, she owns one of the largest and most exclusive 
carousel collections in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In town this weekend for the auction of the Bud Hurlbut carousel collection at 
the Anaheim Convention Center, Stevens says America has once again fallen in 
love with the vintage musical horses. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago they were considered nothing but pieces of wood left to 
dry-rot somewhere," said Stevens, who lives in New Mexico. "Now they're a hot 
item with people all around the country interested in buying them at whatever 
cost. There are not too many things out there built to endure the years like 
the wooden horses have. They are truly collectors' items." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of collectors are expected to attend today's auction that will 
showcase about 120 antique horses and other figures owned by Hurlbut, the 
one-time owner and operator of the rides at Knott's Berry Farm. More than half 
the figures were located at Knott's Lagoon area. 
</P>
<P>
"Hurlbut just basically decided that it was time to let go of the figures," 
said William Mann, a New York collector also in town for the auction. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd held on to them long enough and that it was time for someone else 
to enjoy the antiques." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 6,000 hand-craved wooden carousels that were made in this country 
between 1900 and 1925, only 200 remain and just 80 are in working condition. 
Carousels that are now placed in amusement parks are made of fiberglass and 
aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said the concept of carousels was developed in the 17th Century when 
European horsemen, playing an Arabian game, would ride at full speed to spear 
gold rings with their lances. To practice for this event, the rider used crude 
wooden horses attached by beams to a central pole that was rotated by servants. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants brought the craft to America and soon carousels were a common sight 
at fairs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Dentzel factory and the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., both Philadelphia-based 
operations, were the largest producers of carousels before the Depression.

The Dentzel products currently have the highest value among collectors, with a 
piece made by Gustave Dentzel in 1900 selling for $148,000, the most ever paid 
for a figure, at an auction in 1989. On Saturday, collectors expect a 1903 
Dentzel horse decorated with the American flag to draw the highest bid, 
$100,000. ALLISON SAMUELS

RAIN'S END BRINGS SMILES TO FANS, WINS FOR TAIWAN, SHIPPENSBURG

<P>
With the early morning sun came smiles and nervous anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
With the removal of the infield tarp, a collective sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
And when the players finally took the field Friday morning at Lamade Field, a 
crowd of some 7,000 baseball-hungry fans stood and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
The 44th Little League World Series, having endured two straight days of 
rained-out baseball blues, got back on track Friday to the delight of nearly 
everyone in this live-for-Little League town. 
</P>
<P>
The local favorite, Shippensburg, Pa., finally put away Mobile, Ala., 3-1, in a 
game that was suspended Wednesday with Shippensburg leading, 3-0, in the third 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
And Taiwan had little trouble eliminating Ramstein Air Force Base, West 
Germany, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Both games set up today's championship semifinals: 
</P>
<P>
Shippensburg will play Cypress at 1 p.m. (PDT) for the American title, one that 
will be televised on tape delay at 4 p.m. today on ABC's "Wide World of 
Sports." (If rain is forecast for game time this morning, the game may be 
played earlier, but will still appear on ABC at 4.) 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. (PDT), Taiwan will meet Trail, British Columbia, for the 
international title. The game will be televised, but only in Taiwan by 
Taiwanese TV. 
</P>
<P>
In the American championship game, Cypress (19-1) will be the home team, which 
is somewhat odd considering thatShippensburg is less than a two-hour drive 
south from Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be about 30,000 people here," said Cypress Coach Ron MacDonald, "and 
29,900 of them will be from Shippensburg." 
</P>
<P>
But Cypress, a team whose players say even now it's difficult to believe they 
could get to Williamsport, is not complaining. Especially now that the weather 
has cleared. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad we have blue skies," said Cypress Manager Gary Shelton, who has 
a bad cold. "I was starting to mildew between the toes." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, which beat Brooklyn, Mich., 9-0, in Tuesday's opening round, looks to 
have a tougher challenge in Shippensburg (16-0). 
</P>
<P>
Although Shippensburg's No. 1 pitcher, left-hander Bob Shannon, will not be 
able to pitch today because he pitched Friday (Little League rules state no one 
may pitch on consecutive days unless it's to resume a suspended game), 
Shippensburg pitching coach Gregg Mellott said today's starter, David Orndorff 
is just as effective. 
</P>
<P>
It's a scary thought for Cypress; Shannon (10-0) averages 15 strikeouts per 
game and had his fastball clocked at 75 miles per hour in Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen two guys on the same team this awesome," Mellott said. "It's 
hard to believe sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress will start Bobby Brito, a 5-foot-2, 130-pound right-hander with power 
-- he hit 40 home runs this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Shippensburg was decent," said Brito, whose brothers Gilbert, a standout 
senior quarterback, and Mike, a sophomore running back, will start at Western 
High School this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"They have good pitching, but we've faced guys harder than that. We should be 
able to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
If so, Cypress would find itself in the World Series final, Sunday at 10 a.m. 
(PDT) , probably against Taiwan, which has won the title 13 times and finished 
second twice. One-hour highlights of the game will be shown tape-delayed on 
ESPN Sunday at 2:30 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' Shelton and MacDonald say they aren't looking ahead. Today's game 
against Shippensburg, they say, matches two similar teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have a low-scoring game," MacDonald said. "And we'll need to be 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shelton: "We'll do our best, but even if we don't, being No. 2 in the 
country won't be such a bad thing. . . . Just the fact that we're here in 
Williamsport is a great feeling. It's like a dream. When you're playing with 
the odds that there's 2.5 million kids that play Little League baseball. . . . 
Getting here's something." 
</P>
<P>
The rain delays forced a few position changes for Cypress. The team's best 
pitcher, Kerry Cordero, who usually catches when he's not pitching, was moved 
from catcher to third base. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Cordero, Kerry's father and Cypress' pitching coach, said because a 
victory for Cypress today would put them in the final Sunday, and Kerry would 
start on the mound in the final, Cordero doesn't want his son to wear out his 
arm catching. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't let my pitchers catch the day before they might play," he said. "The 
catcher's got to throw as many times as the pitcher, so we moved him to third 
base." 
</P>
<P>
Damon Katz, starting shortstop and relief pitcher, will catch. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the Cypress players say they aren't that nervous about today's 
game -- Shelton and MacDonald say they'll go through a pack of antacids each -- 
the team has grown tired of the intense media and fan attention. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the rain, few teams have had any chance to practice, so when Cypress 
found a dry spot -- under the bleachers -- where they could at least throw, 
they went for it. 
</P>
<P>
But after just a few minutes of practice, Shelton got a message that his team 
was to change into their warm-up jackets and caps, and report to the Little 
League complex's dining room immediately for an interview with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon guys, back to the cafeteria," Shelton said to his grumbling players. 
"ABC wants us." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the players and coaches sat and waited for nearly 45 minutes 
before the ABC crew arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was look in the camera and smile," Shelton said. "Real important stuff. . . 
. We knew up front this kind of thing was going to happen; it's just that we 
don't really ever get a chance to practice." 
</P>
<P>
And when they practice, or eat, or swim in the pool, or do just about anything, 
the Cypress boys are often trailed by small packs of Williamsport girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Groupies," Shelton said with mock disgust. "They're followed everywhere by 
12-year-old groupies." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. About six or eight girls followed some of the players for most of the 
afternoon. Many more were expected for Friday night's dance held at the Little 
League complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," MacDonald said. "As one of the players put it, they're busing in the 
babes." 
</P>
<P>
The attraction is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"They're cuter than regular boys," said 11-year-old Angela Shannon of 
Williamsport. "They're cuter than Williamsport boys anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, and I like the way they play baseball too. Good hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Cypress players are impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, there are lots of groupies," said Brito coolly. "But they're not all 
that good-looking." 
</P>
<P>
In the stands, the fans at Williamsport have been understandably 
pro-Shippensburg. But they may even be even more anti-Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's game against West Germany's Ramstein Air Force Base (all but one of 
its players is American-born), the crowd booed Taiwan often. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when its manager, Wang Tzyy-Tsann, quickly replaced third baseman 
Hsieh Yih-Chieh after he made an error in the sixth inning. On ESPN, 
broadcaster Brent Musburger called the move "a little harsh." 
</P>
<P>
But, through a translator, Wang defended his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"First off, he made an error," he said. "And second, another player gets a 
chance to play. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The game of baseball is very beautiful -- you can play it to perfection. 
That's what we strive for."

The rainouts that have delayed the Little League championship game until Sunday 
wiped out plans to televise the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will have one-hour taped coverage of the title game, after the telecast of 
the final round of the U.S. Amateur golf championship from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The golf coverage is scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
"If it ends earlier, we'll show the Little League game earlier," a spokesman 
for ESPN said. "But only one hour of the Little League will be shown." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the championship game was to have been televised today on ABC, but 
because the game was postponed, the network instead will show portions of the 
U.S. and international finals, the tournament's semifinals, on a tape-delayed 
basis at 4 p.m. (PDT).

THIS SACRIFICE FLY TO WILLIAMSPORT IS WORTH IT FOR O.C. UMPIRE

Ken Kieling traveled nearly 3,000 miles, spent $1,800 and gave up a week of his 
vacation time. All so he could spend a week telling 11- and 12-year-olds 
whether they're safe or outta there! 
</P>
<P>
Kieling, 42, a resident of Coto de Caza, is in Williamsport this week as one of 
10 umpires at the Little League World Series. It is, Kieling said, a thrill 
like no other. 
</P>
<P>
"You only get to umpire in the Little League World Series once. This is my one 
time," said Kieling, who has been a youth baseball umpire for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Kieling got his one allowed turn as home plate umpire, during the 
Shippensburg, Pa.-Mobile, Ala., game. Friday afternoon, he was the first base 
umpire during the Taiwan-West Germany game. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, this is the highlight of my Little League career," said 
Kieling, an equipment installer for General Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Kieling, who grew up in Manhattan Beach, where he played Little League, started 
umpiring because he saw a need and he wanted to give back to the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just fun," he said. "We're all volunteers, but we love doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Kieling has umpired at two other World Series -- the Big League World Series 
(ages 16-18) in 1983 and the Senior League World Series (ages 13-15) in 1987. 
But this one, he says, is different. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a lot more attention here, and they (Little League officials) just 
treat you real nice," he said. "It's special." 
</P>
<P>
But expensive. Little League baseball does not pay for any of the umpires' 
travel or accommodation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, all the local leagues in our district (South Orange County) helped 
chip in," said Kieling, who has made the trip to Williamsport three times -- in 
1987 as a spectator and last June for an umpire meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Just walking out to do Little League, you've got to put it in perspective," 
Kieling said. "They're just 11- and 12-year-old kids . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But I think it's everybody's dream to play in a Little League World Series, so 
this is the next best thing. You get chills, really. The other day, I had 
butterflies before the game." 
</P>
<P>
Asked for his analysis of the action so far, Kieling said he was most impressed 
with Shippensburg. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a kid throw harder," he said, referring to Bob Shannon, 
Shippensburg's ace. In all my years in Little League, I'd have to say that kid 
was the best I've ever seen. He was clocked at 75 miles per hour. He brings it 
on. He's intimidating, and cocky too." 
</P>
<P>
But Cypress, Kieling said, is impressive too. 
</P>
<P>
"I've umpired Cypress twice in California. I'd say they're comparable to 
Northwood (the Irvine team that made it to the final in 1987)," Kieling said. 
"Cypress hits real well, but their pitching overall is a hair better than 
Northwood's was." 
</P>
<P>
Would he like to pick a winner? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be the typical ump," Kieling said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just say I hope the best team wins." 
</P>

TEAMS EARNED THE RIGHT TO KICK OFF FIRST 
</P>

<P>
Colorado meets Tennessee. It is not a Big Eight -- Southeastern Conference 
clash for the ages, but it is one for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes and the Volunteers have often been the other guys in their 
powerhouse conferences. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the Buffaloes and the Volunteers get to kick off before anyone 
else -- a tribute to their 11-1 records last year and to their top 10 preseason 
rankings this year. 
</P>
<P>
Both will be trying to prove they belong among college football's elite when 
they meet Sunday at Anaheim Stadium in the first Disneyland Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't very long ago that Colorado would have given anything to have 
somebody pay attention to them," Coach Bill McCartney said Friday after his 
team arrived for the game, which will have its own kickoff at noon Sunday. "Now 
we have the opportunity to play a game that kicks off the college football 
season." 
</P>
<P>
This is the beginning of a season in which Colorado is trying to show it 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to prove we can do this year after year," McCartney said. 
"Other teams have had Cinderella seasons, then faded back into their own 
mediocrity. That could happen to Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
Said linebacker Alfred Williams: "Last year wasn't a fluke. We came together 
and played well. I can understand how Tennessee feels. Every time I see an 
article, it's, 'Can Colorado repeat -- question mark.' Maybe we can put an 
exclamation point on it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, which struggled to beat Colorado State by three points in its 
season-opener last year, wants to get off to a better start. The Vols are just 
5-7-1 in openers under Coach Johnny Majors. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was looking to improve my record, I probably wouldn't have scheduled 
Colorado," Majors said. "But we think we can win." 
</P>
<P>
If you want to watch the game like a pro scout, watch either end of the line. 
That is where the battle will be played out between Colorado's outside 
linebackers, Alfred Williams and Kanavis McGhee, and Tennessee's offensive 
tackles, Antone Davis and Charles McRae. 
</P>
<P>
Williams (6-6, 240) and McGhee (6-5, 250) are widely considered the best pair 
of linebackers in the country, and both are predicted to be taken near the top 
of the next NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Majors says he has never seen a better pair of tackles than Davis (6-4, 310) 
and McRae (6-7, 291). 
</P>
<P>
"(Williams and McGhee) are two fine players and there's been a lot written 
about them," Davis said. "This is almost like a debut for the four of us. I'm 
trying not to think about the scouts. I don't want to think, 'If I don't block 
this guy, the scouts aren't gonna think so much of me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who is already the Colorado career sack leader with 22 1/2, knows 
what he's up against. 
</P>
<P>
"Antone Davis, he can run you in the ground if you give him a chance," Williams 
said. "McRae, I haven't seen anybody get a sack against him so far. It's 
probably been done, but I haven't seen it." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Blottiaux, the kicker who made 10 field goals of more than 50 yards while 
playing at Servite High School, was set to be Colorado's starter last spring. 
But he won't be doing the kicking Sunday because he was beaten out by Jim 
Harper of L.A. Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't looking for a kicker, we just came across this guy we couldn't pass 
up," McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a junior, beat out Blottiaux and Eric Hannah, a junior from Capistrano 
Valley High School whose career has been dogged by a back injury first 
sustained in an auto accident during high school. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an easy way to pick a kicker," McCartney said. "You chart 'em, and the 
guy who makes the most, he's your kicker." 
</P>
<P>
The battle for the position probably isn't over, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We elected to go with him for the game, but that's not locked in concrete," 
McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
Blottiaux, a sophomore, played in three games in 1988, including the Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Colorado tailback Eric Bieniemy, suspended for the game after his arrest 
following an altercation with firemen, made the trip, and will be on sideline. 
. . . Ticket sales have reached between 33,000 and 35,000, although organizers 
still say they are expecting a paid attendance of 40,000 for the game. 
Tennessee sold about 7,000 tickets in Knoxville, and Colorado sold about 5,000 
in Boulder.

'WILD AT HEART' TWEAKS 'PEAKS' FREAKS; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: IF YOU SAW THE DAVID LYNCH-DIRECTED TV SERIES AND EXPECT TO SEE THE SAME 
ON THE BIG SCREEN, THINK AGAIN. SOME WHO HAVE SEEN THE NEW MOVIE SAY IT'S TOO 
VIOLENT. 
</P>

<P>
They were, you might say, on the twin horns of a dilemma. Gail McGill and her 
friend, Heather Stapleton, couldn't decide whether to see "Ghost" or the new 
David Lynch film, "Wild at Heart." Waiting in line to buy their tickets, the 
two girls debated the potential merits of each film as they inched closer to 
the ticket window. In the end, the two opted for Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Though neither girl had ever seen a film by the controversial director, they 
both considered themselves " 'Twin Peaks' addicts," and made their decision 
based on their viewing experience of the offbeat television series. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved 'Twin Peaks,' " said McGill, 19, before entering Edwards University 
Theater in Irvine. "I've heard he (David Lynch) makes really weird movies. But 
it can't be any stranger than 'Twin Peaks.' " 
</P>
<P>
A little more than two hours later, McGill emerged from the theater visibly 
shaken. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never see another film by David Lynch," exclaimed McGill, while 
Stapleton nodded in agreement. "It really made me upset. It's nothing like 
'Twin Peaks.' I mean, it's so violent." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, David Lynch the filmmaker has caught by surprise fans who know him only 
as the mastermind behind "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
"Wild at Heart," starring Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern, follows the path of 
Sailor Ripley (Cage) and Lula Pace (Dern) as they try to make their way to 
California to escape the wrath of Lula's psycho mother, played by Diane Ladd. 
With a dark but playful reference to "The Wizard of Oz," the film drips with 
blood and sex and presents one of the strangest list of characters since 
Lynch's last film, "Blue Velvet." While the film features brief appearances by 
some "Twin Peaks" regulars, there's no question that Lynch is operating at a 
different level, far from the constrictive confines of prime-time TV. 
</P>
<P>
Opening last week to fairly enthusiastic crowds, "Wild at Heart" grossed about 
$5.5 million in its first three days. And while the film is attracting the 
usual array of veteran David Lynch fans, it appears that the audience also 
includes a sizable number of "Twin Peaks" fans who are curious about the 
director's celluloid endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
Leonie de Picciotto, vice president of publicity for the Samuel Goldwyn Co., 
which released the film, said there's no question that the popularity of "Twin 
Peaks" is helping box-office figures.

"We had conducted a survey prior to the film's release, and we had found that 
the majority of the people who had watched 'Twin Peaks' knew who the stars were 
but didn't know who David was," De Picciotto said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, De Picciotto said, during the initial promotion of "Wild at 
Heart," television ads heavily promoted Lynch's ties to "Twin Peaks," while 
radio and newspapers ads were mum about the connection. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that people who read newspapers or listened to radio were more 
likely to know who David Lynch was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the film may come as a shock to those who know of Lynch only 
through "Twin Peaks," De Picciotto said there have been reports of some 
walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, it appears the film is getting a good reception," De Picciotto 
said, noting that on opening night last week, Lynch, Cage and Dern had made the 
rounds to a variety of Los Angeles theaters to gauge audience reaction. 
</P>
<P>
At the Edwards University in Irvine, ticket seller Robert Droney said customers 
have walked out or demanded their money back. "When I can, I warn them (ticket 
buyers) if they've never seen a David Lynch film before." 
</P>
<P>
At the Cinedome in Orange, Michael Martinez and his girlfriend, Teresa Gomez, 
were waiting to see the film. Martinez had seen all of Lynch's films, but Gomez 
had never seen any. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked 'Twin Peaks,' said Gomez, 23, from Orange. "Michael said I would like 
his films. But I don't know. I heard it's pretty violent." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, 25, said he lost interest in "Twin Peaks" and never got beyond the 
third episode. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me when they try to compare Lynch, the director of films, and Lynch 
the director of television," Martinez said. "What Lynch does on film opposed to 
what he does on television are two completely separate things." 
</P>
<P>
Following Martinez and Gomez inside the theater was Kelly Stratton, 20, and 
Lisa Griffen, 19. Both women were visiting friends from San Diego and both 
claimed to be big fans of "Twin Peaks," especially of Kyle MacLachlan, who 
plays FBI investigator Dale Cooper in the TV series. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, to be honest with you, I don't know who David Lynch is," said Griffen, 
laughing. "The only reason we came was because we thought 'Wild at Heart' was 
connected to 'Twin Peaks.' " 
</P>
<P>
When told otherwise, the women looked at each other and started laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because of David Lynch," said Craig Peltson, 33, of Fullerton, who 
was seeing the film a second time. "I hope this film shocks the hell out of 
these "Twin Peaks" people. The last thing we need is the commercialization of 
Lynch."

You can burn the flag, and I'll call you a repugnant zealot and forgive you. 
You can be the president of the Saddam Hussein fan club, and I'll call you an 
abysmal judge of hero material and forgive you. You can say that baseball is a 
boring game for wimps and mama's boys, and I'll say that every one of your 
neural synapses has shut down, but I'll forgive you. You can even step on my 
blue suede shoes. 
</P>
<P>
But say anything against garlic around me and be prepared to be called a rotten 
weasel of a slimy, godless Commie who thinks Wonder Bread is daring cuisine and 
who would spend the next 50 millennia in purgatory if I could put the fix in 
with the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I love it that much. 
</P>
<P>
And not only do I believe with all my heart, soul, mind and body that there 
ought to be great braids of garlic bulbs in every kitchen and in almost all 
dishes other than fudge ripple ice cream, I also believe that if you have a 
plot of fertile earth at your command, at least a part of it ought to be 
lovingly planted with the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, growing garlic is about as difficult as tying your shoes. In the 
interest of getting the technical stuff out of the way early so I can get back 
to telling you how great garlic is, here's how it's done: 
</P>
<P>
There are no garlic seeds as such, so you plant individual cloves. Do this 
within a couple of days after you separate the cloves from the bulb. The cloves 
should be planted in the fall, flat end down, in sandy or cultivated and 
fertilized soil, about three fingers apart and an inch deep (very little space 
is needed for a good-sized crop). 
</P>
<P>
You can also do this in a container at least 6 inches deep, using potting soil. 
Because garlic is a member of the lily family, it thrives on moisture and 
should be watered at least every five days. A nitrogen fertilizer should be 
used four or five times during its growing period. 
</P>
<P>
At harvest time (summer), the shoots above ground will begin to turn yellow and 
flop over. When this happens, stop watering for a week or more to let the bulbs 
dry out and form the parchment-like skin that covers the cloves. To harvest 
them, grab the shoots and gently pull up the bulbs. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
Then, if you want to get that homey Mediterranean look in your kitchen, you can 
braid the shoots together, forming the bulbs into a kind of marvelously 
fragrant rope, and hang it up, always at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure it's kept in a cool, dry, ventilated place, out of the sun (not the 
refrigerator). It'll keep from four to six months that way. If new green shoots 
begin to appear out of the bulbs, that doesn't mean the garlic's unusable. The 
taste, however, will be milder. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic will keep indefinitely if frozen in clove form and packed in plastic 
freezer bags. But if you're crazed for garlic -- which makes you one of the 
finest, truest and most utterly wonderful people on the planet -- the bulbs 
won't be around long enough to lose even the slightest bit of pungency. 
</P>
<P>
You don't like garlic, you say? Nonsense. You just think you don't like garlic. 
Actually, what you're probably worried about is garlic breath, which, no 
question about it, is a fact of garlic life. And you can forget covering it up 
by brushing your teeth and going through a case of mouthwash. Because when you 
eat garlic, raw or cooked, an oil contained in the plant called allicin enters 
the bloodstream and is transferred to your breath through your lungs. As long 
as you have allicin in your bloodstream, you're going to have garlic breath. 
</P>
<P>
But who cares? Consider the trade-offs: 
</P>
<P>
Allicin, in the body, turns into ajoene, an ingredient that research seems to 
indicate reduces the risk of blood-clotting at least as effectively as aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic repels mosquitoes and fleas. Priests in the Middle Ages who ate it could 
circulate among their flock who were dying of bubonic plague and not become 
infected by the contaminated fleas that were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It's a natural antibiotic. In 1858, Louis Pasteur discovered that garlic juice 
killed bacteria in culture dishes (no less than two dozen kinds, including 
staphylococcus and salmonella). During World War I, battlefield surgeons 
sterilized scalpels by drawing them through garlic cloves; in World War II, it 
was known as "Russian penicillin." (Prohibition-era gangsters, not exactly up 
on their biology, used to tip their bullets with garlic, thinking that if the 
bullets didn't do their job, the garlic would cause gangrene in the victim. 
Pure hogwash.) 
</P>
<P>
Medical studies have suggested that garlic (as well as onions, leeks, chives 
and scallions) may offer some protection against stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The ancient Egyptians swore oaths on it. Roman soldiers ate large amounts of it 
to gain strength for both battle and amorous encounters. 
</P>
<P>
It tastes terrific. 
</P>
<P>
It smells wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Not sure about that last one? Drive through Gilroy during the last weekend in 
July. That's when the town's Garlic Festival is going on. Gilroy processes 
about 90% of all the garlic used in the United States. During the festival 
weekend, the entire region smells like every bit of it is sizzling in frying 
pans. 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't make your salivary glands cut loose like fire hoses, you've 
been dead for 10 years and probably ate cold gruel while you were alive. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're still worried about garlic breath, all you have to do is hang out 
with other people who love it. You'll cancel each other out, and nobody will 
smell a thing.

THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT REVIVAL HITS HOME

<P>
Who says you can't live in the past? Patrick Sheridan does, and he loves every 
minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach designer is enthralled by architecture and furniture created 
during the turn-of-the-century American Arts and Crafts movement. Works 
embraced simple, straightforward designs made of quality material with enduring 
construction techniques. They were conceived as a reaction to an underlying 
distrust of the Industrial Age. 
</P>
<P>
In today's high-tech, high-pressure, complicated world, the simple designs made 
famous by Louis C. Tiffany, Ernest A. Batchelder, Frank Lloyd Wright, Gustav 
Stickley Morris, and Charles and Henry Greene seem like a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
If it's true that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then the late 
great champions of the American craftsman ideal would indeed be gratified to 
know that Sheridan is keeping their contribution to American architecture 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
There is a renewed national interest in the functional stylings of the period. 
In December, 1988, Barbra Streisand paid $363,000 at Christie's, the New York 
auction house, for a Stickley sideboard. Last year, L. and J.G. Stickley Co. 
resuscitated its Arts and Crafts line, making 50 different reissues available. 
</P>
<P>
Arts and Crafts pieces were created with the spirit that everything should work 
together, a well-made object fitting perfectly into a well-made universe. 
</P>
<P>
In the humble California Craftsman bungalow -- a rebellious response to the 
rococo stylings of the Victorian Era -- exposed wood beams, natural stone piers 
and earth-toned finishes embrace casual living, comfort, warmth and simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Nature is integral to the design. Rows of casement windows let in the sunshine, 
sleeping porches welcome the breeze, broad eaves provide shade and gardens 
extend the house outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
When Sheridan was hired by physicians Lee Sandler and Kathleen Farinacci to 
remodel their Three Arch Bay beach house built in 1930, the couple had two 
priorities: to eliminate the steep driveway and enlarge the master bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, we rebuilt the whole house," Sheridan says, "demolishing 
everything but two exterior walls and one-third of the existing roof." 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the steep driveway required that the garage be moved to the street 
level and a second floor added. In so doing, Sheridan created entry space on 
both levels, expanding the floor space from 1,450 square feet to 2,774 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we remodeled the whole house, this two-story entry and the pool area 
at the base of it were the focal points of the project," Sheridan says. 
</P>
<P>
Sandler, a diving enthusiast, wanted a pool. A courtyard with a panoramic ocean 
view at the rear of the house was already in place, so Sheridan decided to 
build a 10-foot lagoon-style swimming pool, pond and waterfall in the front 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of the brothers Greene and Greene, who designed with river 
rock, 60 tons of river rock was used, selected from one quarry for uniformity. 
Larger stones weighing a ton or more were set with a crane. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech and ecological elements were blended with the "functional, direct and 
durable" design, Sheridan says. The house is equipped with a different solar 
water-heating system for the house, the hot tub and the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Charles Greene said it best," Sheridan says, " 'The idea is to eliminate 
everything unnecessary to make the whole as direct and simple as possible, but 
always with the beautiful in mind as the final goal.' " 
</P>
<P>
The movement's clean-line approach is evident upon crossing the threshold of 
the Laguna Beach home and facing the entry staircase. It is finger-jointed to 
the risers and patterned after the one in Greene and Greene's Gamble House, 
built in Pasadena in 1908. Finger-jointing also appears in the outside 
baseboard corners, fireplace mantel and exterior trim. 
</P>
<P>
The staircase and its hidden sliding storage panel, exterior doors, windows and 
interior doors are fashioned from Honduras mahogany. "In restoring the house, 
we almost put mahogany on the endangered-species list," Sheridan says. 
</P>
<P>
Quarter-sawn oak flooring was used throughout, exhibiting its "tiger-tail" 
patterns inherent in the wood. "We ran the floors at 45-degree angles to the 
walls," Sheridan explains, "on a bias, like in the Gamble House." 
</P>
<P>
The result is a chevron pattern that directs the eye to points of interest 
throughout the home. 
</P>
<P>
Another Greene and Greene hallmark, the "cloud-lift" detail, which is a line 
that is offset, like a camshaft or railroad siding, was used extensively on 
upstairs handrails, interior and exterior doors, the garage door and on 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan incorporated an additional Craftsman wood-joining detail, a Z-splice, 
in the ridge beam. It is visible under the skylight in the upstairs hallway. 
Combined with other woodworking details, it gives a jigsaw-puzzle appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Exterior and interior light fixtures were re-created in the Craftsman style. 
Four copper lanterns with glass inserts hang throughout the property. One bears 
the house number and graces the front of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of the movement's philosophy that the entire house be 
harmonious, Sheridan designed and built bookcases, lamp tables, desk and 
hanging wooden lamps -- "the all-important details," he calls them -- for the 
home. Carpets, table settings, picture frames and hardware designed in the 
Craftsman style are readily available due to the movement's revival. 
</P>
<P>
Quipped the designer's chief detail carpenter, David Hansen, as they neared the 
end of the 10-month remodeling project: "It's getting Greener and Greener."

When the Williamses look out the window of their Newport Beach home, they like 
to see green. Like many homeowners, however, they have limited yard space. To 
satisfy their penchant for plants, they've chosen to garden in containers. 
</P>
<P>
Their property is dotted with white ceramic pots of various shapes and sizes 
that contain everything from citrus trees to herbs and gardenias. Pots surround 
their pool, bringing color to an area that is otherwise gray granite and 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"We use pottery for exterior design," says Nancy Williams. "The pottery we 
chose gives our yard the look we like. The interior of our house is clean and 
contemporary, and we wanted a uniform look outside as well." 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons to garden with containers other than just aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the finite capacities of pots, just about any plant can grow in them, 
says Charles Crum, president of Flowerdale Nurseries and past president of the 
California Assn. of Nurserymen. "Everything from azaleas and camellias to fruit 
trees can flourish in containers." 
</P>
<P>
You can regulate the amount of light exposure that plants in pots receive. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the exposure of your house, a spot may be sunny in summer, but 
shady in winter. Many homes get casting shadows from other close structures 
such as condominiums," says Kelly Kong-Green, manager of Flowerdale Nurseries 
in Costa Mesa. "If the plant is in a container and it needs sun, you can move 
it in the winter to a sunnier location. 
</P>
<P>
"When you garden in pots, you also start with sterilized soil, so you don't 
have the same soil-borne pest problems that you would if you planted in the 
ground," says Kong-Green. "Potting soil also already has a balanced soil, so 
there are no amendments to be made, and you can control watering and drainage, 
which is not always possible in the ground." 
</P>
<P>
The array of pottery available for outdoor gardening today has grown over the 
years, allowing homeowners infinite choices to complement the design of their 
homes and yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the last few years, the outdoor pottery industry has really grown," 
says Kong-Green. "People don't automatically pick out a plant and put it in a 
half whiskey barrel anymore. Conscious of style and color, many homeowners 
demand more control over their exterior design. 
</P>
<P>
"There is every color in the rainbow, and more," says Kong-Green. "Gainey Pots 
is one major manufacturer, and they have every shade of green that you can 
possibly imagine." 
</P>
<P>
There are plain clay pots, of course, but Laurene Garchow, operations director 
for the Pottery Shack in Laguna Beach, suggests multicolored pots with designs 
or raised figures "like lions." 
</P>
<P>
"They come in all shapes, sizes and styles such as Southwestern, French 
country, Grecian, floral, Oriental and contemporary," says Garchow. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Irvine credits Kevin Campbell of Roger's Garden in Corona del Mar for 
recommending cement containers for her Laguna Niguel home. "They complement the 
atmosphere of our house and I like how he placed cement animals in between the 
pots," says Irvine. "They don't look like the run-of-the-mill clay pots and 
because they're made of cement, they won't break. " 
</P>
<P>
Take your time when you select a pot, suggests John Scott, sales manager for 
David Brooks Company Inc., a Huntington Beach maker of high-fired pottery. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to find the right match. Certain plants look better in certain pots," 
says Scott. "Examine the shape of your plant and its foliage and the shape of 
the pot. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, many palms have graceful, lacy fronds. Don't put such a plant 
into a pot that is very tublike, because that would eliminate its elegance. You 
want to choose a more slender, vertical pot," says Scott. "On the other hand, 
some succulents have very thick, heavy leaves and would need a much fatter tub. 
A thin pot with a huge succulent just wouldn't look right." 
</P>
<P>
Most people are familiar with the standard red clay pottery made in Italy, 
Mexico and the United States, mostly in Southern California. Italian and 
American pottery is more durable because it's fired at higher temperatures for 
longer periods of time than most Mexican pottery. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexican red clay pottery only has a life of a couple years. It gets 
discolored, cracks, chips and leaks. High-fired ceramic, on the other hand, 
will last for hundreds of years," says Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The pot's durability can't be judged just by looking at it. Ask if it's been 
high fired and expect to pay more for it. 
</P>
<P>
Glazed ceramic pots are high-fired twice, the second time to apply the glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete planters, which are less expensive than large clay pots, are good 
containers for very large plants but are very heavy. A lightweight alternative 
is fiber glass pots that look like they are made of terra cotta. And Rubbermaid 
has a line of plastic pots. 
</P>
<P>
Sizes for pottery range from 2 to 42 inches in diameter. Prices range from a 
few dollars for small containers and about $70 for a large, 22-inch pot to over 
$100 for very large pots. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that your plant thrives in a container: 
</P>
<P>
Select a pot "that will sustain the life of the plant for about two to three 
years," says Kong-Green. "You will need a container that's two to three times 
the size of the plant's root ball." 
</P>
<P>
If the container is too large for the plant, the top growth will suffer and the 
plant won't form a healthy root structure. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a pot with drainage holes or drill them in. If the plant and pot are very 
large, set them up on wooden blocks to allow for better drainage. 
</P>
<P>
"Use potting soil, not planting mix," says Crum. "The latter inhibits drainage. 
Don't use soil from the ground. It's likely to have a high salt content and 
that can damage potted plants." 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that container plants need more diligent attention than plants in 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Because potted plants have a limited supply of soil from which to get 
nutrients, they need to be fertilized more often. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they dry out quickly and may need to be watered every day in hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Drought-tolerant plants in pots are no longer considered drought tolerant."

4 NEW ROSES NAMED FOR ALL-AMERICAN HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL ARONSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four new roses have won 1991 honors from All-American Rose Selections, 
indicating they have outstanding qualities for your garden. 
</P>
<P>
The winners are Sheer Elegance, a pink hybrid tea; Perfect Moment, a 
yellow-orange hybrid tea; Shining Hour, a yellow grandiflora; and Carefree 
Wonder, a pink landscape rose. 
</P>
<P>
AARS, a nonprofit organization of rose producers and introducers, tests new 
varieties. Before selection as AARS winners, the roses undergo a two-year 
testing period that includes heat, drought, cold wind, insects, diseases and 
picky judges in all areas of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The winning roses will be available to consumers in the spring of 1991, and 
earlier in certain Sun Belt areas. 
</P>
<P>
Sheer Elegance is one of the few AARS winners hybridized by an amateur, Jerry 
Twomey of Leucadia, Calif. It was introduced by DeVor Nurseries of Watsonville, 
Calif., and is reportedly highly disease-resistant. It is of medium height, 
with blooms described as non-fading, soft pink with almond-colored edges, and 
with a mild-to-strong musky fragrance. The rose is reportedly prolific and a 
quick bearer, with long, stiff, florist-quality stems. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect Moment features an unusual yellow-based flower with red tip. The bud 
opens in a slow spiral to show high-centered, heavy blooms with excellent 
keeping qualities. The plant has dark green, leathery foliage and good disease 
resistance. Introduced by Jackson &amp; Perkins of Medford, Ore., Perfect 
Moment was hybridized by Reimer Kordes of Sparrieshoop, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Shining Hour, "highly floriferous," has high-centered, yellow blooms of 
approximately 35 petals. The bush shows good vigor, with medium green, glossy 
foliage and an upright, dense habit. This flower, also introduced by J&amp;P, 
was hybridized by William A. Warriner, who has hybridized more AARS winners 
than anyone else. Warriner retired in 1988 as J&amp;P's vice president of 
research.

Carefree Wonder, an everblooming landscape rose with low maintenance needs, is 
reported very hardy in winter and summer. The colorful blooms feature rich, 
pink petals with creamy pink reverse, 4.5 inches across. The 3- to 4-foot bush 
is described as vigorous, with an orderly, rounded habit. It was introduced by 
the Conard-Pyle Co. of West Grove, Pa., and hybridized by Selection Meilland, 
Antibes, France, the family that brought out the famed Peace Rose.

The Winningest 
</P>
<P>
What type of rose wins the most awards in the AARS testing program? 
</P>
<P>
AARS says it's a hybrid tea in a shade of pink, followed by the popular red. 
</P>
<P>
A 50-year review of AARS winners indicates that hybrid tea roses won the 
designation almost 2 to 1 over other rose classifications. There were 71 hybrid 
tea rose winners, 40 floribundas and 18 grandifloras. A few miniatures, 
climbers and shrub roses also have earned the awards through the years. 
</P>
<P>
Other top colors were white, yellow and orange. Less frequent winners were 
unusually colored roses such as 1948 winner Diamond Jubilee (buff), 1969 Angel 
Face (lavender) and 1984 Intrigue (plum). 
</P>
<P>
Pleasure, a coral pink floribunda, was the lone 1990 award choice. 
</P>
<P>
"While classic hybrid tea roses traditionally have been the most popular type 
of rose, we're constantly evaluating new introductions," said AARS president 
Omer Schnedier, of DeVor. "These introductions include more modern types of 
roses, such as shrub and miniatures, and a variety of colors."

EXPERTS GOOFED UP ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoy reading your "Ask the Handyman" column very much. Sorry to say, there 
are a couple of goofs in the Aug. 4 edition that bear comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the item about the six-outlet adapter, Don Jordan of Jordan Hardware was 
quoted as saying, "Once you turn all six of those things on, you'll overload 
the circuit." WRONG. One could have thousands of neon lights plugged in, or 
hundreds of electric clocks, or dozens of 25-watt light bulbs. The criterion is 
the total load on that particular circuit. 
</P>
<P>
As long as it is under 15 or 20 amperes including power factor (unless you know 
for sure, presume 15 for safety), the number of outlets or cords or appliances 
is meaningless. Right now in the den in which I am writing this letter, I have 
my entertainment center plugged into one wall outlet with 17 active outlets 
daisy-chained from it. But the maximum total load on that wall outlet is under 
500 watts, the total load on that circuit is well under 15 amps, my extensions 
are all new, are protected from physical damage, are rated at 15 amps although 
they only carry up to four, and thus the setup is perfectly safe. I use many of 
the six-outlet adapters. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Ames Kergesian of Buena Park Lumber said, in reference to the 
water-to-cement ratio for mixing concrete: "There is no perfect consistency. 
The thinner the mixture, the slower it's going to set." WRONG. Setting time is 
normally of no real significance whatever. However, the final strength of the 
concrete, which is usually very significant, varies roughly as the inverse of 
the amount of water used in the mix. Always use the absolute minimum of water 
you can get by with on any particular job. The ideal mix is one so stiff it 
must be pounded into place. If it must be poured, use the least amount of water 
that will still allow it to flow. I know commercial operators usually use soupy 
mixes, but their chief aim in life is to pour quickly.

HOW TO PICK REMODELING CONTRACTOR;

HOME REPAIR: CHOOSE THE INDIVIDUAL OR COMPANY BY SCRUTINIZING HIS OR HER STATE 
LICENSE AND CHECKING ON REFERENCES, FOR STARTERS.

Last year, $237 million was spent in Orange County on residential additions and 
alterations, according to the Construction Industry Research Board, a nonprofit 
research center in Burbank serving the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of a home-remodeling job that requires a contractor can range from a 
few hundred to tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
With so much money at stake, you would think that homeowners would select a 
contractor with more care than picking out a steak for dinner, but they don't, 
says Paige Roush, supervising deputy for the Contractors State License Board in 
Santa Ana. "The biggest mistake homeowners make is they don't shop around for 
their contractor." 
</P>
<P>
With 5,155 licensed contracting firms in Orange County, selecting the right one 
for the job is a matter of narrowing the field. 
</P>
<P>
Michele King of Garden Grove hired a person that she thought was a licensed 
contractor to install a sprinkler system, replant her lawn and remove a tree. 
When the lawn grew in, it was mostly weeds, the sprinklers were too high for 
the lawn mower to clear, they leaked, and they didn't water large sections of 
the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out $2,600 for work we're having to redo," King says. "As soon as the 
workers got paid, they were gone. They won't come back and fix it. There's 
nothing we can do because we later found out they aren't licensed, so the 
Contractors State License Board can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
The board can issue a citation or, in some cases, file criminal charges against 
unlicensed contractors, but it can't order the contractor to repair faulty work 
or pay restitution. These options are available only when there's a dispute 
with a licensed contractor. 
</P>
<P>
When King hired the contractor, he gave her a card with a contractor's license 
number. After calling the license board, King discovered that the license 
wasn't his. 
</P>
<P>
"The contractor had been in the neighborhood doing small jobs for so long that 
he was a familiar face. Nobody thought to check on him," King explained. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid problems, the license board offers guidelines for selecting a 
qualified contractor: 
</P>
<P>
Make sure the contractor has a current, valid license. A license number alone 
is no guarantee. The license may have expired, belong to another contractor or 
be invalid in other ways. The license board will verify name and address, 
issuance and expiration date, names of personnel authorized to use the license 
and whether a bond has been posted. Call (714) 558-4086 for verification. 
</P>
<P>
Gather written bids from at least three different contractors. All bids should 
be based on the same plans and specifications. Don't automatically accept the 
lowest bid; ask the other contractors to explain their higher bids. They may 
have included costs, such as higher-quality material, permits and licensing, 
that the contractor who submitted the lower bid didn't include. 
</P>
<P>
Call references and ask: Were you pleased with the completed work? Did the 
contractor finish on time? Did the contractor willingly make any changes or 
corrections? 
</P>
<P>
Make sure that the contractor has Workers' Compensation and liability 
insurance. If the contractor does not carry this coverage, the homeowner is 
liable for any injuries resulting from work done on his property. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of an information booklet, "What You Should Know Before You Hire a 
Contractor," can be requested by calling the license board's Santa Ana district 
office at the above number. 
</P>
<P>
Once a contractor has been selected, the written contract becomes the 
foundation of the owner-contractor relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"The terms in the contract are for the owners protection," says Jim Futrell, 
who teaches a course on "Controlling Construction Costs" to contractors and 
homeowners at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners should look at what Futrell calls the "three magic words" in a 
contract: cost, quality and time. The contract should itemize costs, the 
quality of the materials to be used, and the start and completion dates. 
</P>
<P>
Other concerns that need to be in writing are insurance coverage, payment 
schedule and the method of implementing changes once the work has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"The additional time and additional costs, due to those little things the 
homeowner wishes to add, cause the most ill feelings between the contractor and 
homeowner," Futrell says. "There's nothing wrong with changing things, but you 
should know how much it's going to cost before you start the change, and put 
that in writing in the contract." 
</P>
<P>
If you communicate with the contractor from start to finish, and agree on the 
cost, quality and time, you shouldn't have a problem, Futrell says, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"Hiring a contractor does not have to be an unpleasant experience."

LIABLE FOR WORKERS YOU HIRE?; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: COVERAGE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT YOU BRING IN TO DO 
HOUSEWORK, YARDWORK, REPAIR JOBS OR PAINTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a homeowner, it's likely that at some time or another you'll hire 
somebody to work on your home. Your homeowner's liability insurance will cover 
you for certain situations but not all, leaving you open for personal lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that in terms of insurance coverage, degrees of responsibility 
vary from state to state. They also depend on what type of labor you might 
employ: domestic, casual or professional. 
</P>
<P>
A domestic worker is hired to perform ordinary household duties such as 
preparing meals, mopping floors and making beds. Domestic workers are entitled 
to workers' compensation insurance in many states. Depending on the state's 
laws, insurance is purchased by the employer or jointly by employer and 
employee. The coverage provides cash benefits and medical coverage for workers 
who become disabled due to an on-the-job injury or sickness. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a New Jersey court ruled that a teen-ager who accidentally cut off 
his toe when he was hired to mow the grass fell under workers' compensation 
rules. Because of this, the situation wasn't covered under the homeowner's 
regular liability insurance and a $2-million personal lawsuit resulted. 
</P>
<P>
When covered by workers' compensation insurance, an employee can't sue his or 
her employer, so it's a mutually beneficial system. 
</P>
<P>
Casual labor refers to people you pay to work around your house on an 
occasional basis, such as baby-sitters age 17 and under, minors who might do 
odd jobs or an adult hired to do painting or repairs on a part-time basis. 
Casual workers are excluded from workers' compensation laws but are covered on 
most standard homeowner's policies. 
</P>
<P>
Professional labor includes anyone that a homeowner enters into a written 
contract with to work on his or her property. Remodeling contractors, 
carpenters, roofers or landscapers fit into this category. These workers should 
have their own insurance. In most states, they can't be licensed without it. It 
is still your responsibility to make sure these professionals are insured, so 
ask to see their certificates of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
You are totally liable for any damage to property or personal injury involving 
an uninsured professional on your property. Also, if a professional is using 
any of your equipment, such as a ladder, you are liable for injury caused by 
any defect in that equipment. If he suffers an injury falling from his own 
ladder, you are not liable. 
</P>
<P>
The gray area in liability is with casual labor. They're probably covered under 
your homeowner's policy, but only up to a certain amount. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you employ an uninsured college student to paint your house, 
and he falls off a ladder and suffers permanent spinal damage, your $50,000 
liability probably won't satisfy either him or his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Before amateurs engage in high-risk work on your property, talk to your 
insurance agent. It may be to your benefit to buy extra insurance, since you 
can have your policy altered to include a specific individual. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, when purchasing a homeowner's policy, you must disclose any hazards 
on your land, such as a hole or a pond. If you don't, you won't be covered in 
the event of an accident involving that hazard. Also, check out an umbrella 
liability policy. For about $100, you can buy $1 million worth of protection 
that covers situations well beyond the basic liability policy. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners are plowing a lot of money into their yards, but most homeowners 
insurance policies provide only limited coverage for such open-air investments. 
Up to $500 per plant or tree and up to 5% of the total value of the property is 
typical. 
</P>
<P>
Now, according to Erik Haupt, chairman of the Council of Tree and Landscape 
Appraisers, there is a move afoot to develop special landscape insurance and to 
expand the scope of landscape protection under homeowners policies to include 
hazards such as wind damage. This new type of landscape protection may be 
available before the end of the year.

COUNCIL APPROVES MASSIVE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council gave the go-ahead Friday for a $650-million 
development project bordering the Harbor Freeway, despite protests from some 
council members that it will add congestion to already overburdened freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved, 9 to 4, an agreement between the Community Redevelopment 
Agency and City Centre Development, clearing the way for the first phase of 
construction on Metropolis, a massive downtown complex that will comprise three 
office buildings, a hotel and a retail center. 
</P>
<P>
But several council members denounced the project, saying the 
2.3-million-square-foot development bounded by 8th, 9th, and Francisco streets 
and the Harbor Freeway will only worsen a clogged freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to strangle the city," Councilman Marvin Braude said of the 
development. "We have to ask the fundamental question, 'What's happening to our 
city?' Congestion has overpowered it." 
</P>
<P>
The downtown stretch of the Harbor Freeway is the most congested in California, 
and with the construction of Metropolis and other such projects, peak rush-hour 
traffic is expected to increase 150% by the end of the 1990s, said Bob Rogers, 
chief hearing examiner for the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners believe, however, that "the benefits of the project 
overrode the traffic impacts," said Rogers, adding that the project's 
developers will pay $34 million for undeveloped Convention Center space -- half 
of which will go toward the center's expansion and the other half for city uses 
including housing, transportation, child care and open space. 
</P>
<P>
With the city about to consider an ordinance that would make downtown 
developers pay for the traffic problems caused by their projects, several 
council members expressed concern that Metropolis' first phase of construction 
had a built-in exemption from such a law. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Valenzuela, director of operations for the CRA, said it would be unfair 
to impose the traffic reduction improvement fee on the first phase of the 
development because the developers were negotiating with the agency long before 
such an ordinance was considered. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if such a fee were approved, Metropolis' builders would have to 
pay it for each of the development's four later phases. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will probably begin in January, with completion 
of the complex expected about the year 2001.

DAVID ROSE, 80; AWARD-WINNING COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
David Rose, the Emmy- and Grammy-winning Hollywood composer and conductor 
responsible for such diverse hits as "The Stripper" and "Holiday for Strings," 
has died. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Rose died Thursday evening at St. Joseph Hospital in Burbank of heart failure, 
his publicist, Paul Marsh, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The London-born Rose recorded more than 50 albums, scored 36 films, and 
composed themes and background music for 24 television series including 
"Highway Patrol," "Sea Hunt," "Bonanza" and "Highway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Rose earned an Oscar nomination for the 1961 song "So in Love," written for 
Frank Sinatra in the movie "Wonder Man." 
</P>
<P>
He won four Emmys -- two for "Little House on the Prairie," and one each for 
"Bonanza" and "The Fred Astaire Show." 
</P>
<P>
Rose took home five Grammys -- for "Holiday for Strings," "Our Waltz," "The 
Stripper" and the "Like Young" and "Like Blue" albums with Andre Previn. 
</P>
<P>
He racked up six gold records -- "Holiday for Strings," "The Stripper," 
"Calypso Melody," "Dance of the Spanish Onion" and the "Like Young" and "Like 
Blue" albums. 
</P>
<P>
Rose studied piano as a child and began his career at 16, playing for Ted 
Fiorito's dance band in Chicago. While studying at the Chicago College of 
Music, he served as standby pianist for NBC radio and began arranging music. 
</P>
<P>
Invited to Hollywood, he formed the David Rose Orchestra for Mutual 
Broadcasting System, arranging the music for a show called "California 
Melodies." 
</P>
<P>
Rose and actress-singer Judy Garland, after announcing their engagement in 
June, 1941, eloped to Las Vegas later that year. The marriage lasted one year. 
</P>
<P>
Rose broke into television with Red Skelton's show in 1947, and soon added 
Hallmark and the Jack Benny and Bob Hope shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The Stripper" came about in 1962, when Rose was working on a show called 
"Burlesque" that needed music for a strip act happening onstage while stars Dan 
Dailey and Joan Blondell argued in a dressing room. He dashed off eight bars, 
titled it, and let the band clown around with it. The impromptu idea topped the 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is survived by his wife, Betty, two daughters, Melanie and Angela, and 
three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The family asked that memorial contributions be made to the David Rose Memorial 
Music Fund at USC; the Young Musicians Foundation, 195 S. Beverly Drive, 
Beverly Hills 90212, or the St. Joseph Medical Center Foundation, 501 S. Buena 
Vista St., Burbank 91505-4866.
